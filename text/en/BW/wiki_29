<text>A suplex is an offensive move used in sport wrestling as well as amateur wrestling and professional wrestling. It is a throw that involves lifting the opponents and bridging or rolling to slam them on their backs.

Professional wrestling features many different varieties of suplexes. These are among the most common, but many more exist, particularly as the signature techniques of individual wrestlers.

==Front facelock variants==
In these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other, the attacking wrestler then applies a front facelock to the opponent before executing a throw. In most cases, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move. The most common front facelock suplex is the vertical suplex.

===Fallaway suplex===
Also known as a reverse suplex or an alley-oop. The wrestler lifts their opponent so that they are seated on the wrestler&#x27;s shoulders, facing away from them, as in a powerbomb. The wrestler then falls backwards while throwing the opponent the same way, dropping them down to the mat on their chest. Another version sees the wrestler pick the opponent up on to their shoulders in a powerbomb position and dropping backwards while throwing the opponent so that the opponent flips forward and lands on their neck and upper back. A bridging variant is also available.

====Package fallaway suplex====
This variation of the fallaway suplex sees the wrestler lifting the opponent so that they are seated on the attacking wrestler&#x27;s shoulders as in a powerbomb. The wrestler then grabs the opponent&#x27;s head and forces them into a &quot;package&quot; position. From there the wrestler falls backwards, throwing the opponent over their head, forcing them to land on their upper back and neck. A bridging variation is also possible. This move is used by Dragon Lee, Kota Ibushi (both are calling it the &quot;Phoenix-Plex&quot;) and it was formerly used by Kevin Steen.

===Fisherman suplex===
Also known as a fisherman&#x27;s suplex or the leg hook suplex, this move has the opponent in a front facelock with the near arm draped over the attacker&#x27;s shoulder; the wrestler hooks the opponent&#x27;s near leg behind the opponent&#x27;s knee with their free arm and falls backwards, flipping the opponent onto their back. In most cases, the attacking wrestler will keep the leg hooked and bridge to pin the opponent in a cradle-like position, as in the case of Mr. Perfect and Curtis Axel&#x27;s &quot;Perfect-plex&quot;. Other times the wrestler will apply a leglock submission hold to the hooked leg. It is used by Peyton Royce as the &quot;Venus Flytrap&quot;, as well as Penelope Ford.

====Swinging fisherman suplex====
More commonly referred to as swinging fisherman neckbreaker, it is a swinging variation of the standard fisherman suplex; this move has a wrestler, with the opponent in a front facelock with the near arm draped over their shoulder, hook the opponent&#x27;s near leg with their free arm and roll over to the same side of the arm being used to hook the opponent&#x27;s leg, flipping the opponent over onto their back. This was used by WWE superstar Tyson Kidd right before his career ended. This move is currently used by Tony D&#x27;Angelo called &quot;Fuhgeddaboutit&quot;.

===Hammerlock suplex===
In this variation of the suplex, the attacker applies a hammerlock on the opponent before applying a front facelock and positioning the opponent&#x27;s free arm over the attacker&#x27;s head. The attacker then lifts up the opponent and falls backwards, dropping the opponent down back first, landing with their trapped arm bent behind their back. Junji Hirata has innovated this move.

===Slingshot suplex===
The attacker faces a standing opponent with one side of the ring immediately behind the opponent. The attacker applies a front facelock to the opponent, takes hold of the opponent with their free hand, then lifts the opponent until they are nearly vertical. The attacker then falls forward so that the torso of the opponent bounces off the top ring rope, and uses this momentum to quickly lift the opponent overhead once more and fall backwards, driving the back and shoulders of the opponent into the ground. Tully Blanchard used this maneuver as his finishing hold during his runs in Jim Crockett Promotions and the WWF.

===Suplex slam===
This move is similar to most suplexes and starts with the attacker applying a front face lock to the opponent and draping the opponent&#x27;s near arm over their shoulder, then lifting the opponent up and holding them in the vertical position. This is where the move differs from most of its counterparts, with the attacker not falling with the opponent, but rather shifting themselves slightly and throwing the opponent to the mat on their back. Sometimes this involves the wrestler turning the opponent in midair and slamming the opponent down to the mat &quot;in front&quot; of them onto their back, similar to a high-angled body slam. The suplex slam can also be used for other suplexes such as the fisherman suplex or gutwrench suplex.

There is also a sitout version. Also called a suplex driver or a &quot;Falcon Arrow&quot;, this sees an attacker apply a front facelock to the opponent and drape the opponent&#x27;s near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then takes hold of the opponent&#x27;s torso with their free arm and lifts the opponent to a vertical position. The facelock is loosened so the opponent can be twisted slightly, then the attacker falls to a sitting position and the victim&#x27;s back and shoulders are driven into the mat. The opponent lands between the attacker&#x27;s legs with their head toward them. This variation was innovated by Hayabusa, and used by Damian Priest and Seth Rollins among others, with the former calling the move the &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;.

Another variation sees the wrestler perform a vertical suplex, but instead of twisting the upside down opponent to face them, the wrestler turns 180Â° to face the opponent before sitting down and driving them back-first between their legs.

====Reverse suplex slam====
Also called a front drop suplex or a gourdbuster, this move sees the attacker apply a front face lock to the opponent and drape the opponent&#x27;s near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then lifts the opponent into a vertical position, then falls or kneels forward, driving the opponent&#x27;s face into the ground. A standing version also exists. It was invented by Arn Anderson and its kneeling variant was popularized by Sgt. Slaughter.

In the sitout version, the attacker applies a front face lock to the opponent and drapes the opponent&#x27;s near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then lifts the opponent into a vertical position, and falls into a sit-out position, driving the face of the opponent into the ground. In another variation, the wrestler releases the hold just prior to the sitout position, letting the opponent&#x27;s own momentum force them down head-first. Used by Jeff Hardy and Jay Briscoe.

===Superplex===
A superplex (a portmanteau of &quot;super&quot; and &quot;suplex&quot;) refers to any suplex performed by an attacker standing on the second or third rope against an opponent sitting on the top rope or top turnbuckle. The most common suplex used for this top rope move is the standard vertical suplex variation (known as the suicide-plex), in which the attackers apply a front face lock to the opponent, draping the opponent&#x27;s near arm over their respective shoulders, at this point the wrestler falls backwards and flips the opponent over them so they both land on their backs. This was invented by the Dynamite Kid as his finisher. Brian Cage and Cesaro version was for them to hoist their opponent from the ring apron. Larger wrestlers that have performed this, such as Brock Lesnar in 2003 on The Big Show, have broken the ring.

===Tornado suplex===
In a set-up similar to a tornado DDT, a wrestler goes to the top rope and applies a front facelock on their opponent from an elevated position, draping the opponent&#x27;s near arm over their shoulder. The wrestler then jumps forward and swings around, but lands on their feet and performs a suplex on their opponent.

===Vertical suplex===
In a set-up similar to a snap suplex, the attacking wrestler applies a front face lock to the opponent, draping the opponent&#x27;s near arm over their shoulder, when the opponent is in position they are lifted to an upside-down position before the attacking wrestler falls backwards slamming the opponent&#x27;s back into the mat. This is also known as a front suplex or simply as a suplex.

The delayed variation of a vertical suplex, also known as the hanging suplex, standing suplex or stalling suplex, sees the attacking wrestler holds an opponent in the upside-down position at the peak of the arc for several seconds before completing the maneuver, thereby (in kayfabe) causing blood to pool into the head of the opponent. This move is a staple of larger and powerful wrestlers as it gives an aura of dominance over their opponents who can do nothing but wait to drop in the suplex. In the WWF, this variant was commonly used first by The British Bulldog, and then by Bobby Lashley.

The rotating variation of a vertical suplex, also sometimes known as the rotation suplex, rotary suplex, or twisting suplex, sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but turn around as they fall back to twist the opponent into the mat.

====Drop suplex====
This variation of a vertical suplex sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but then simply drop them flat to the mat instead of falling backwards with them. The move was first popularized in WCW by Kevin Nash, who began to use it instead of a standard suplex to avoid aggravating a back injury.

====Rolling release suplex====
This variation of a vertical suplex, also known as the X-plex as well as the &quot;Crash Landing&quot;, sees the attacker lift the opponent up with the standard suplex lift, but instead of falling backwards and having the opponent drop down onto their shoulders and back, the attacker turns the opponent and releases them from the front facelock at the apex of the lift. Both the attacker and the opponent fall forward, with the opponent landing on their neck, shoulders, and back. Used by Pete Dunne.

====Rolling non-release suplex====
Also known as triple rolling verticals, or triple rolling vertical suplexes, this variation of a vertical suplex sees the attacking wrestler perform a single vertical or snap suplex to the opponent, but the attacking wrestler does not release the hold, instead rolling their legs and body into a standing position to execute a second suplex, then repeats the process for a third suplex. This was popularized by WWE Hall of Famer Eddie Guerrero, who used this move, calling it the &quot;Three Amigos&quot;. Many other WWE superstars used this move to pay tribute to him, such as his nephew Chavo Guerrero, Rey Mysterio and Seth Rollins.

====Running suplex====
This variation is similar to a classic suplex, including the attacking wrestlers beginning with a standard front facelock, and then when they starts lifting the opponent, they make a few running steps forward while continuing the suplex rotation, slamming the opponent back-first onto the mat.

====Snap suplex====

This move sees the attacker apply a front face lock to their opponent, draping the opponent&#x27;s near arm over their shoulder. The attacker stomps down hard and suplexes the opponent stiffly, resulting in a quicker throw. It can also be used to toss them into the turnbuckles.

====Swinging vertical suplex====
This variation of a vertical suplex sees a wrestler holding their opponent in a front facelock with the near arm draped over their shoulder, lifts the opponent then roll over to one side, flipping the opponent over onto their back. This move is also somewhat similar to a Whiplash Neckbreaker but without the usage of the ring ropes. Used by Dustin Rhodes as the &quot;Final Cut&quot; in WWE or the &quot;Final Reckoning&quot; in AEW.

=== Jumping suplex ===
Instead of just falling down onto their own back, the attacking wrestler jumps up and uses their momentum to drive the opponent down to the mat back first.

===Underhook suplex===
Also known as a half-hatch suplex. It is performed in similar fashion to a snap suplex. The wrestler applies a front facelock with one arm, but instead of draping the arm over their shoulders as seen in most suplexes, the attacker underhooks one of the opponent&#x27;s arms with their other, placing their hand palm-down on the back of the opponent. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up while bridging backwards, bringing the opponent overhead and onto their back. This can be performed with or without a pinning combination in which the wrestler bridges their back and legs to hold the opponent&#x27;s shoulders against the mat. It can also be done with a kick for an added snap effect.

==Belly-to-back variants==
In these variants, the attacker stands behind their opponent and applies a hold before falling backwards, dropping the opponent on their upper back. The most common belly-to-back variants are the German suplex and the back suplex.

===Belly-to-back suplex===

For the belly-to-back suplex, the wrestler stands behind their opponent and puts their head under the arm of the opponent. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up grabbing the waist and thigh of the opponent, so the opponent is on the attacker&#x27;s shoulder. The attacker finally falls backwards, dropping the opponent flat on their back. Standing release versions of this move also exist with the attacker dropping the opponent behind them or to the side back first. Another version where the opponent is thrown forwards is called an &quot;Atomic Throw&quot;.

Some wrestlers perform the back suplex into a bridging position, simultaneously arching their own back and legs to elevate themselves, gaining leverage and pinning their opponent. Very popular in Mexico&#x27;s Lucha Libre, where this bridging version is known as a Puente Griego or Greek Bridge in English. In 2018, the Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan announced a campaign to introduce this variant of the suplex to international soccer.

Since the wrestler taking the move is falling backwards, the potential for injury is significant if it is not performed properly. Japanese wrestler Mitsuharu Misawa suffered a spinal injury which triggered a fatal cardiac arrest during his last match in 2009 after Akitoshi Saito gave him the belly-to-back suplex.

====High-angle belly-to-back suplex====
Also known as a backdrop driver/suplex, the attacking wrestler stands behind their opponent and puts their head under the arm of the opponent. They then lift the opponent up using both of their arms wrapped around the torso of the opponent. The attacker finally falls backwards to drive the opponent to the mat on their neck and shoulders. Used by &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams and Takeshi Morishima.

====Leg hook belly-to-back suplex====
Sometimes referred to as a leg lift back suplex or leg lift backdrop, it is applied just as a back suplex would be, except that the wrestler wraps only the near arm or no arm around the torso of their opponent. With the free , the wrestler then hoists their opponent&#x27;s knees or thighs and throws them backwards in that manner. William Regal uses a bridging version called the &quot;Regal-plex&quot; while Baron Corbin and Kevin Owens uses a spinning version called the &quot;Deep Six&quot; (Corbin) and the &quot;Sidewinder Suplex&quot; (Owens). Former indie wrestler Human Tornado uses a flipping version called the &quot;DND - Dat Ninja Dead&quot;.

A wrist-clutch variation exists used by Jushin Thunder Liger as the Liger-Plex.

Another version of this move sees the attacking wrestler, while standing a facing opponent, hooks a near arm under the opponent&#x27;s near armpit and around their neck with inside of the hand. Then the wrestling uses their far hand to grab the opponent&#x27;s near leg and lifts if off of the ground. The wrestling then falls backwards throwing the opponent onto their head, neck, and upper back. This move best is used by both Drew Gulak calling it the &quot;Southern Lights Suplex&quot; (sometimes while holding the opponent into a bridge to attempt to score a pinfall) and Joker as the &quot;JokerPlex&quot; respectively.

====Cobra clutch suplex====
The attacker places the opponent in a cobra clutch hold. They then proceed to lift the opponent up and fall backwards, driving the opponent to the mat on their head.

====Crossface chickenwing suplex====
The wrestler stands behind the opponent. They lock one of the opponent&#x27;s arms in a chickenwing, and wraps their other arm around the opponent&#x27;s head. They then lift the opponent up and falls backwards, driving the opponent on to the top of their head, down to the mat.

====Crotch clutch suplex====
This move involves the attacking wrestler approaching an opponent from behind, reaching down and grasping their crotch with both forearms, with hands together and facing upwards into their groin, and lifting him overhead into a belly-to-back release suplex. The opponent reacts to both the suplex and being grabbed and lifted by their crotch, to humorous effect.

====Dragon suplex====
Invented by Tatsumi Fujinami, this belly-to-back suplex variation sees the wrestler apply a full nelson and then bridge their back, lifting the opponent over him and onto their shoulders down to the mat. The wrestler keeps their back arched and the hold applied, pinning the opponent&#x27;s shoulders down to the mat. The wrestler may also release the opponent mid-arch, throwing them down to the mat shoulders and neck first, in a variation known as release dragon suplex.

====Electric chair suplex====
Also known as an electric chair slam. The wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an electric chair sitting position and then bridges their back, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first.

====German suplex====

Also known as a reverse gutwrench suplex or simply a German, this move sees the wrestler stand behind the opponent, grab them around their waist, lift them up, and fall backwards while bridging their back and legs, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first. The wrestler keeps the waistlock and continues bridging with their back and legs, pinning the opponent&#x27;s shoulders down against the mat. The regular pinning variation can be referred to as the German suplex pin or German suplex hold. The wrestler can also release the opponent in mid arch, which is referred to as a release German suplex. Both the standard and pinning variants, which was created in the 1950s, were named after its innovator, Karl Gotch, who had originally coined the move to be known as the Atomic suplex, but had to be scrapped by Japanese promoters due to the taboo nature of the Japanese atomic bombings post-Second World War.

Sometimes, rather than bridging for a pin, the wrestler may roll himself into another position to perform the move again, often referred to as &quot;multiple, rolling, or non-release German suplexes&quot;, in which the attacking wrestler performs a German suplex, then rolls their legs to get back into a standing position, but does &quot;not&quot; let the opponent go to do so. The attacking wrestler then repeats this numerous times, most commonly three, but sometimes up to eight or more. The WWE superstar that uses the maneuver most commonly is Brock Lesnar, although it has also been used by Chris Benoit, Kurt Angle, and others in the past. This move is confusing referred by some color commentators on television as a belly-to-back suplex.

A delayed, high-angle pinning variant of the standard German suplex, which targets the opponent&#x27;s head and neck more than the shoulders or upper back, is known as an Everest Suplex or a Mount Fuji Suplex in reference to heights of these mountains.

A Rebound German suplex sees the wrestler, while standing behind an opponent, shoves them forwards into the corner turnbuckles or ring ropes with enough force to cause them recoil backwards to then grab them around their waist, lift them up, and fall backwards while bridging their back and legs, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first. A bridge can also be applied to attempt to score a pinfall. The move can also be used a counter against a charging opponent with the wrestler moving off to one&#x27;s side allowing the opponent hit the turnbuckles or ropes causing them to stumble backwards to which the throw can be performed. Another version of this move, known as a &quot;21 plex&quot; and innovated by Mexican luchador Bandido, begins with the opponent standing facing the ropes, while hunched over grabbing the second rope trying to catch their breath or recovering from an attack. They then charge towards the opponent from behind, then leaps into the air performing a front flip while applying a rear waist lock tucking their head forwards and to either side to allow themself clearance to roll onto the standing opponent&#x27;s back. They use the momentum placing their legs on the top rope for leverage to bounce upwards and roll backwards to land on their feet to perform the German suplex. Another version of this move called a Rebound O&#x27;Connor roll German suplex sees the wrestler standing behind the opponent. After applying a rear waistlock, the attacking wrestler then charges forwards propelling the opponent chest first into the turnbuckles or ropes using the momentum from the collision to roll backwards, while maintaining the waistlock, with enough force to roll backwards over the opponent who were on their shoulders with the attacking wrestler rolling on top of their legs to both end up in a standing position to which the wrestler performs the German suplex. A bridging version of this move is the most common. An alternative name for this move is known as the &quot;Chaos Theory&quot; as popularized by retired English wrestler Douglas Williams as a finisher and is currently being used by WWE wrestler Chad Gable also as a finisher.

====Straight jacket suplex====

The straight jacket suplex or package German suplex has the attacker trapping the opponent&#x27;s arms while performing a German suplex. Variants such as the cross-arm suplex or X-Plex see the opponent&#x27;s arms crossed across their chest and held by the attacker. The wrestler then uses the crossed arms as leverage to aid in lifting the opponent up while falling backwards to throw the opponent as in a German suplex.

====Half and half suplex====
This is a suplex variation in which the wrestler, while standing behind the opponent, places one arm in a Half nelson and the other arm in a chickenwing. The wrestler then proceeds to fall backwards while lifting the opponent overhead in the hold and driving them into the mat behind them. This move is referred to as a half and half suplex as it is a combination of a half nelson suplex and a tiger suplex. The move can be either released or brought into a pin. This variation is often used by Sami Zayn.

====Half nelson suplex====
This is a version of a German suplex where the attacker stands behind the opponent, facing the same direction. The attacker uses one hand to apply a half nelson hold and wraps the other hand around the opponent&#x27;s waist. The attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, dropping the opponent on their head, neck, or shoulders. The move can be either released or brought into a pin.

====Pumphandle suplex====
The wrestler stands behind the opponent and bends him forward. One of the opponent&#x27;s arms is pulled back between their legs and held, while the opponent&#x27;s other arm is hooked by the attacker maneuvering their arm around in front of the opponent&#x27;s shoulder (as in a pumphandle) and securing it behind the head (a quarter-nelson). The attacker then lifts their opponent up, over their head and falls backwards to slam the opponent against the mat back-first.

There are many variations of the pumphandle suplex, including the maintaining of the grip in order to land the opponent on the mat face-first, or inverting the opponent&#x27;s body position and securing the opponent&#x27;s free arm using a half-nelson grip instead of the normal quarter-nelson. STARDOM wrestler Momo Watanabe used the pumphandle half-nelson as the &quot;Peach Sunrise&quot;. AEW commentator and former wrestler Excalibur also used the move as the &quot;Galactica Phantom&quot;.

====Sleeper suplex====
The attacker places the opponent in a sleeper hold and then hooks one of the opponents arms with their free arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, driving the opponent on their head. A slight variation sees the attacker apply a half nelson choke instead of the sleeper hold before performing the suplex. Jay White uses this move.

====Katahajime suplex====
The attacker stands behind the opponent, facing the same direction. The wrestler puts one arm in a half nelson and the other hand around the neck in front of the opponent, like in a sleeper. The hand in front of the neck is locked with the other hand at the wrist. With the grip secure, the attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, dropping the opponent on their head, neck, or shoulders. The move can end in a release or bridging position. This was invented by Tazz as the &quot;Tazmission-plex&quot;.

====Three-quarter nelson suplex====
Invented by Mitsuharu Misawa. The attacker places their opponent in three-quarter nelson before lifting them and falling backwards, dropping them on their head or neck. It is also known as the &quot;Tiger Suplex &#x27;85&quot;, due to its association with an August 1985 match between Mitsuharu Misawa, then working as the second incarnation of Tiger Mask, and Kuniaki Kobayashi.

====Tiger suplex ====

Innovated by the original Tiger Mask (Satoru Sayama), this move sees the wrestler standing behind their opponent, hooks both of the opponent&#x27;s arms from the sides, and places their hands palm down flat against the opponent&#x27;s upper back. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, arching their back and legs and then slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and neck first. Like other suplex variations, this move can either end in a bridging pin or be released upon execution. A Wrist-Clutch variation was invented by Tiger Mask IV (Yoshihiro Yamazaki), called &quot;Tiger Suplex &#x27;09,&quot; because he invented it in 2009.

====Wheelbarrow suplex====
This move is performed when a wrestler wraps a forward-facing opponent&#x27;s legs around their waist, in a wheelbarrow hold, from either standing behind an opponent who is laying face-first on the mat or by catching a charging opponent before then applying a waistlock to lift the opponent up off the ground into the air, then the attacking wrestler would continue lifting the opponent over their while falling backwards to hit belly-to-back suplex.

==Belly-to-belly variants==
In these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other. The attacker then applies a bodylock before falling backwards and flipping the opponent onto their back and down on the mat.

===Belly-to-belly suplex===

The wrestler wraps their arms around the opponent in a waistlock or a bodylock position and flips them over by violently bridging their own body so the opponent lands on their back. This can be done either overhead or to the side. Used by Bayley as the &quot;Bayley to Belly&quot;.

====Side belly-to-belly suplex====
For a side belly-to-belly suplex, the attacker usually holds on to the opponent for the duration of the move.

===Overhead belly-to-belly suplex===
For the overhead belly-to-belly suplex, the attacker usually executes an overhead throw and lets go of the opponent. It can also be performed in a &quot;snap&quot; fashion, where the attacker stomps down hard and suplexes the opponent stiffly, resulting in a quicker throw.

====Capture suplex====
The attacker stands facing a standing opponent. The attacker then catches one leg of the opponent and pulls the opponent towards them so that they are face-to-face, with the attacker reaching under the opponent&#x27;s leg and hooking it. The attacker then uses their free arm to reach behind the neck of the opponent and take hold of them. The attacker then quickly bridges backwards and releases the opponent, throwing them overhead, or turns 180Â° while slamming the opponent down to the mat. This move can be used to counter a kick. The move is also known as the head and leg suplex, and can be seen as a variation of the head and arm suplex.

====Butterfly suplex====
Also known as double arm suplex, reverse nelson suplex, double axe handle suplex, and double underhook suplex, the wrestler and opponent face each other, the opponent bent forward. The wrestler hooks the opponent&#x27;s arms back in a Double Underhook, placing their forearms in the crooks of the opponent&#x27;s elbows, with their hands on top of the opponent&#x27;s back in a butcher&#x27;s grip. The wrestler then lifts the opponent into an upside-down vertical position and falls back, shifting the opponent to one side as the opponent flips over. The wrestler executing the suplex may release the reverse nelson hold during the throw, or can maintain the grip and attempt a bridging pin or submission hold transition upon impact. Sara Del Rey version was for her to apply a butterfly hold before executing the suplex, dubbed the &quot;Royal Butterfly&quot;. Bryan Danielson innovated another variation, where he executed the double underhook suplex, before dropping their opponent&#x27;s into a cross armbreaker, dubbed the &quot;Danielson Special&quot;. This move was also used by the late wrestlers Billy Robinson and Andre the Giant.

====Exploder suplex====

Also known as T-bone suplex. The attacker stands facing their opponent and positions himself under one of the opponent&#x27;s arms and wraps their arm around the opponent&#x27;s neck and back (this position is similar to that of a side slam) and then grabs the leg of the opponent and tosses him backwards, over the attacker&#x27;s head. Several other variations exist, such as an inverted variant, commonly used by Shinsuke Nakamura, the wrist-clutch exploder suplex, innovated by Jun Akiyama who called it the &quot;Exploder &#x27;98&quot;, and the bridging exploder suplex invented by Takashi Iizuka (also called &quot;Blizzard Suplex&quot;). The move is used by Taz and Becky Lynch as the &quot;Bexploder&quot;.

====Head-and-arm suplex====
Also called a gargoyle suplex, the move is a variation of the traditional overhead belly-to-belly suplex in which the wrestler, standing face-to-face with their opponent, clutches their hands together having firmly encircled the opponent&#x27;s head and one arm. This grip, as opposed to the waistlock of a normal belly-to-belly, is then used to hoist the opponent in the overhead arching throw.

====Northern Lights suplex====

Invented by Hiroshi Hase. The attacking wrestler puts their head under the arm of the opponent, wraps their arms around the waist of the opponent and flips them backwards. This suplex can either be released or bridged into a pin. The wrestler can also float over into another Northern Lights suplex.

====Table top suplex====

Also known as a fallaway slam, the wrestler lifts the opponent up so the opponent is horizontal across the wrestler&#x27;s body then falls backward, throwing the opponent over their head down to the mat back-first. This slam can be either bridged into a pin, or the wrestler can float over into another fallaway slam. This move is sometimes used as a continuation move from catching the opponent&#x27;s high-cross body, to emphasize the wrestler&#x27;s strength.

====Trapping suplex====
Also known as a &quot;Double arm locksault&quot; or a &quot;Front salto&quot;, this is when a wrestler holds both the opponent&#x27;s arms under their own (known as &quot;overhooks&quot; in mixed martial arts and amateur wrestling, as the arms loop under the opponent&#x27;s arms from above) with the hands connected below the opponent&#x27;s triceps, from here the opponent is left secure and unable to counter or move away from the attacker while their delivers a belly-to-belly throw flipping the opponent overhead in the normal belly-to-belly motion. In amateur wrestling and other contact-sports, the trapping suplex is called the &quot;Suicide throw&quot;, a &quot;Salto&quot;, or a &quot;Side salto&quot;. It is done slightly differently, usually the opponent is tossed to the side and lands on their back.

This move consists of one wrestler picking up their opponent off the ground (or mat) and then using a large portion of their own body weight to drive the opponent down on the mat. They begin face-to-face, then the attacker forces the opponent&#x27;s head down and locks the opponent&#x27;s arm around it.

==Side variants==
In the side variants the attacker stands to the side of their opponent and applies a hold before falling backwards to slam the opponent to the mat. The most common is the Saito suplex.

===Gutwrench suplex===
This throw involves a wrestler standing on one side of a prone opponent locking both arms around the opponent&#x27;s waist near arm in front of the opponent and far arm behind, and lifting him/her up to slam him/her over back-first down to the mat. An inverted version also exists.

==== Karelin Lift ====
A gutwrench suplex which begins with the opponent laying face down on the mat. The wrestler locks their arms around the opponent&#x27;s waist and stands up, lifting the opponent. They then throw the opponent to their side, dropping them to the mat up on to their upper shoulders, back, and neck or face down on their chest. Named after the Greco-Roman wrestler Alexander Karelin, who is famous for using the move.

AEW wrestler Claudio Castagnoli has used two separate versions of this move. The first saw him lifting their opponents from the side, stands up, turns the opponent upside down to fall into a sitting position to drop them on their neck or head to either side of him. He called this the &quot;Lasartesse Lift&quot; and used this as a finisher in 2007 while on the independent circuit. Currently, the second version sees him throwing the opponent flat onto their back and uses this as a signature move while sometimes maintaining the hold to roll into a standing position to throw them two more times.

===Saito suplex===
Also called Backdrop suplex and Backdrop driver. The attacker stands either facing directly one of their opponent&#x27;s sides or slightly behind in an angle. They places the opponent&#x27;s near arm over their shoulder, grabs a waistlock, and then lifts the opponent up while falling backwards, causing the opponent to land on their neck and shoulders.
There is also a leg-hook variation where the attacker stands behind and to one side of the opponent. The attacker wraps one arm around the waist of the opponent and grabs the back of the opponent&#x27;s near leg with their other arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent on to their shoulder and then falls backwards, driving the opponent into the mat at a high angle. This was used by Karrion Kross as the &quot;Doomsday Saito&quot;. Shawn Michaels used a leg-hook version in the early 90&#x27;s as the &quot;Teardrop Suplex&quot;.

===Schoolboy Suplex===
Also known as a Schoolboy-plex, the moves sees the attacking wrestler drop down behind the opponent and put one arm up between the opponent&#x27;s legs to pull the opponent over the attacking wrestler so that they fall flat on their back. The wrestler then stands up to use their free underhand to grab, around the side of the opponent&#x27;s near thigh to lift them off of the ground off their back. The wrestler, while turning the opponent nearly 90 degrees, falls backwards to toss the opponent back first onto the ground. It&#x27;s possible for the wrestler, while holding onto the opponent, to apply a bridge. Former wrestler Bob Backlund used this move as a signature mostly in Japan. WWE wrestler Andrade Almas used this move as a finisher dubbed the &quot;Sombra Driver / Brillante Driver / Shadow Driver&quot;. Braun Strowman has also used this move.

===Side suplex===
:&quot;See Ura-nage.&quot;
This move is also known as a sambo suplex or side suplex. To perform it, the wrestler stands face-to-face with the opponent, slightly to their side. The wrestler either reaches across the opponent&#x27;s chest and around their neck with their near arm and locks both hands behind the opponent&#x27;s shoulders or just locks both hands behind the opponent&#x27;s waist. The wrestler then simultaneously lifts the opponent up, twists 180Â° and falls backwards, bringing the opponent over them and slamming the opponent back-first on the mat.

The name ura-nage (or uranage) comes from a Judo throw which translated directly from Japanese, means &quot;throw to behind/back&quot; and is commonly (albeit incorrectly) used to refer to a regular side slam in pro wrestling. The Judo ura-nage throw more closely resembles a saito suplex in execution.

====Cravate suplex====
This sees a wrestler lock their opponent in a cravate and pull down with their arms so that the opponent is forced to bend over. The wrestler then positions the opponent so that they are facing across the body of the wrestler and with their head in front of the wrestlers chest while still standing. The wrestler then falls backwards, pulling upwards with the cravate and forcing the opponent off their feet into the air and over the wrestler, landing on their neck and shoulders. Invented by Chris Hero.

==Inverted facelock variants==
In these suplexes, an attacker begins by facing the back of an opponent and applying an inverted facelock before executing a throw. In most, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move.

===Inverted Suplex===
Also known as a reverse suplex, this move sees the attacker stands behind an opponent and applies an inverted facelock with one arm, and uses the other arm to aid in elevating the opponent so that he/she is lifted up and held upside-down before the attacker falls to their back driving the opponent down to the mat face first, behind the attacker.

==In other sports==
Suplex tackles in gridiron football are not allowed and may be subject to penalties or even fines.

<text>Real Life are an Australian new wave and synth-pop band that achieved international chart success with their 1983 singles &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot; and &quot;Catch Me I&#x27;m Falling&quot;, both of which were taken from their debut studio album, &quot;Heartland&quot; (1983). The band originally consisted of David Sterry (lead vocals and guitar), Richard Zatorski (keyboards and violin), Allan Johnson (bass), and Danny Simcic (drums). Steve Williams (keyboards) replaced Zatorski in 1986, and was replaced by George Pappas in 1995 after a long hiatus of band activity.

==History==
===1980â1984: &quot;Heartland&quot;===
In late 1980, Richard Zatorski placed an ad in a Melbourne newspaper as a keyboard player looking for a guitarist with whom to write songs, and David Sterry responded. The two formed a writing partnership and began work on the material that would eventually become the first songs by Real Life. First using the name The Wires, Sterry and Zatorski started doing gigs accompanied by a primitive drum machine they named Gloria. In 1981, the pair decided to recruit more musicians, and through another newspaper ad, they found bassist Allan Johnson and drummer Danny Simcic. The group changed their name to avoid confusion with the English band Wire, and became known as A Private Life, which soon gained a loyal following, opening for bands such as INXS, Mi-Sex, The Church, Midnight Oil, and others. A band from Sydney called Private Lives threatened legal action over their name, which prompted them to change it once again, this time to Real Life.

After hearing an early version of &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot;, the group&#x27;s manager, Glenn Wheatley, was so impressed that he formed his own label, Wheatley Records, to release it as a single in early 1983. &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot; became a top 10 hit in Australia, and led to Real Life being signed to the Curb Records label (which was distributed by MCA Records at that time) for the world outside of Australia. The song went on to top the charts in New Zealand and Germany, and entered the top 30 in the US. The second single, &quot;Openhearted&quot;, was released in August 1983 and peaked at #72. In November 1983, &quot;Catch Me I&#x27;m Falling&quot; was released, eventually reaching the top 10 in Australia and Germany, as well as the top 40 in the US. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Heartland&quot; (produced by Steve Hillage), entered the top 40 in Australia, Germany, New Zealand, and Switzerland, and peaked at #58 in the US. &quot;Always&quot; was released in Europe in August 1984 as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single, followed by the November 1984 release of &quot;Master Mix&quot;, an EP of remixes that peaked at #74 on the Australian charts.

===1985â1986: &quot;Flame&quot; and &quot;Down Comes the Hammer&quot;===
In September 1985, they released &quot;Face to Face&quot; as the lead single from their second studio album, &quot;Flame&quot;, which came out the following month. &quot;Face to Face&quot; was a minor hit, peaking at #32 in Australia, while the album peaked at #42. The follow-up single &quot;One Blind Love&quot; fared less well, while the album and its singles went largely overlooked in the rest of the world.

In 1986, they recorded a handful of new songs, which were the band&#x27;s first recordings not written by Sterry and Zatorski. &quot;Babies&quot;, written by the songwriting team of Holly Knight, Michael Des Barres, and Mike Chapman, was released as a single, but failed to chart; another track, &quot;Hammer of Love&quot;, was written by Steve Williams, who had replaced Zatorski earlier in the year. Both tracks were included on a compilation titled &quot;Down Comes the Hammer&quot; (which also included another new song, a remix of the title track of &quot;Flame&quot;, and a handful of other tracks from the band&#x27;s two albums), which was only released in North America and France. Also in 1986, the movie &quot;Rad&quot; featured &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot; on its soundtrack, and featured it in a scene wherein riders on BMX bikes performed various freestyle stunts as the song played.

===1989â2000: &quot;Lifetime&quot; and &quot;Happy&quot;===
In 1989, Real Life released a new version of &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot;, titled &quot;Send Me an Angel &#x27;89&quot;, which fared slightly better than the original in the United States. The video for the 1989 version was identical to the original, except that Zatorski was edited out of all shots; another version for the Australian market was filmed in Ormond College, University of Melbourne, with Williams on keyboards.

The group released their third studio album, &quot;Lifetime&quot;, in 1990. This was their first album of all-new material in five years. The album spawned minor hits with &quot;God Tonight&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Ground&quot;, both of which placed on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks and Dance Club Songs charts in the United States. After a falling-out occurred between Sterry and the remaining two original members, Johnson and Simcic, the band went on hiatus for several years.

In 1997, Real Life reemerged as a duo with Sterry and new member George Pappas on keyboards. Following the release of their fourth studio album, &quot;Happy&quot;, the band embarked on an extensive tour of the US, Germany and Australia, and were invited to perform at Salt Lake City&#x27;s Synthstock2000 with Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Berlin.

===2003âpresent day: &quot;Imperfection&quot;===
In 2003, the band signed to the American independent label A Different Drum, and released their fifth studio album, &quot;Imperfection&quot;. They toured the west coast of the US in 2004 as a trio of Sterry and Pappas with drummer Scott Ingram. In November 2005, Pappas announced his departure from the band, leaving Sterry to continue as Real Life on his own, performing at various 1980s-themed events such as Australia&#x27;s Absolutely 80s and the US&#x27; Lost 80&#x27;s Live. Pappas began recording solo material under the name Alien Skin in 2007, and A Different Drum released his debut album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Open Till Doomsday&quot;, the following year.

On 19 May 2009, Real Life released their sixth studio album, &quot;Send Me An Angel â &#x27;80s Synth Essentials&quot;, on Cleopatra Records in the US. In addition to another new recording (and two remixes) of &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot;, the album also includes cover versions of twelve other 1980s new wave classics by acts such as Depeche Mode, The Cure, Eurythmics, Tears for Fears, and Gary Numan.

After another lengthy hiatus, Sterry resurrected Real Life again in 2020 with a new studio album, &quot;Sirens&quot;.

<doc id="640406" wikidata="Q1489665" url="?curid=640406" title="Upminster Bridge tube station">
<text>Upminster Bridge is a London Underground station in the Upminster Bridge neighbourhood of Upminster in the London Borough of Havering, east London. It is on the District line between to the west and to the east. It is along the line from the eastern terminus at Upminster and to in central London where the line divides into numerous branches. The station was opened on 17 December 1934 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on the local electrified tracks between Upminster and Barking that were constructed in 1932. The main station building, on Upminster Road, is of a distinctive polygonal design by William Henry Hamlyn. It has relatively low usage for a suburban station, with approximately 1.15 million passenger entries/exits in 2017.

==History==
The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway from London Fenchurch Street and Barking was constructed through the Upminster Bridge area in 1885, with stations at Hornchurch and Upminster. The Whitechapel and Bow Railway opened in 1902 and allowed through-services of the District Railway to operate to Upminster. The Metropolitan District converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were cut back to . Delayed by World War I, electrified tracks were extended by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to Upminster and through-services resumed in 1932. The District Railway was incorporated into London Transport in 1933 and became known as the District line.
The new tracks built by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway allowed additional intermediate stations to be constructed on the local lines between 1932 and 1935. Increased local demand was caused by the expansion of the built-up area of suburban London during the interwar period. The infill station at Upminster Bridge was designed by William Henry Hamlyn, the chief architect of the LMS, and opened with platforms on the local electric lines on 17 December 1934. The station was operated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway but was only served by District line trains. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways and in 1969 ownership transferred to the London Underground.

==Design==

The station consists of a central island platform between the tracks that are elevated on a railway embankment. There are four tracks through the site although there are no platforms for the main lines. The full length of the platform is covered by a single canopy with a central waiting room.

The Art Deco red brick ticket office is located below platform level, to which it is connected by a subway and stairway. Although similar to the other single-storey station buildings on this part of the route, it is notable for its high atrium roof and polygonal shape. The floor is tiled with a reversed swastika pattern, a popular decorative design at the time the station was constructed. The station was listed locally as a building of local heritage interest by Havering London Borough Council.

As part of the publicâprivate partnership arrangement for maintenance of the London Underground, the station was refurbished by Metronet during 2005 and 2006. Works included provision of tactile strips and colour contrasted handrails for the visually impaired, installation of closed-circuit television cameras, passenger help points, new electronic departure information displays on the platforms, a new public address system and improved lighting. The station does not have step-free access from the platforms to the street.
==Location==

The station is named after a nearby crossing of the River Ingrebourne. The river was the boundary between the ancient parishes of Hornchurch and Upminster and the station is located on the western Hornchurch side. The station is situated on Upminster Road in the London Borough of Havering and is flanked by a parade of shops. It is situated in a primarily residential area and is near to Havering Sixth Form College and Hornchurch Stadium.

The London Loop key walking route passes outside the station, and it forms the end point of section 22 from Harold Wood and the starting point of section 23 to Rainham. The station is located on the eastern extremity of the District line and is the penultimate station before the terminus at Upminster. Upminster station is to the east of the station and Hornchurch is to the west.

London Buses routes 193, 248 and 370 serve the station, providing connections to County Park Estate, Cranham, Lakeside, Queen&#x27;s Hospital and Romford.

==Services==

The station is in London fare zone 6. The typical off-peak service from the station is 12 District line trains per hour to Upminster and 12 to Earl&#x27;s Court, of which six continue to Ealing Broadway and six continue to Richmond. At peak periods the number of trains per hour increases to 15 and some trains continue from Earl&#x27;s Court to Wimbledon. Services towards central London operate from approximately 05:00 to 23:30 and services to Upminster operate from approximately 06:00 to 01:30. The journey time to Upminster is two minutes.

Since 2006, the station has been one of the first on the network to operate without a staffed ticket office.

Total number of passenger entries and exits at the station during the year is as follows:

During 2011 there were 990,000 passenger entries and exits at the station, continuing a trend of growth over the preceding eight years, but lower than neighbouring stations on the route.

<text>Quinidine is a class IA antiarrhythmic agent used to treat heart rhythm disturbances. It is a diastereomer of antimalarial agent quinine, originally derived from the bark of the cinchona tree. The drug causes increased action potential duration, as well as a prolonged QT interval. As of 2019, its IV formulation is no longer being manufactured for use in the United States.

==Medical uses==
Quinidine is occasionally used as a class I antiarrhythmic agent to prevent ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in Brugada Syndrome, although its safety in this indication is uncertain.

It reduces the recurrence of atrial fibrillation after patients undergo cardioversion, but it has proarrhythmic effects and trials suggest that it may lead to an overall increased mortality in these patients.

Quinidine is also used to treat short QT syndrome.

Eli Lilly has discontinued manufacture of parenteral quinidine gluconate in the US, and its future availability in many countries is uncertain.

===Other uses===
There is one study supporting the use of a novel combination of dextromethorphan and low dose quinidine in alleviating symptoms of easy laughing and crying (pseudobulbar affect); these are a type of rather severe uncontrollable behaviors which can be present in various neurological pathologies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. The dose of quinidine (10Â mg two times daily) is about 1/40th of a relatively low antiarrhythmic dose (400Â mg, twice or 3 times daily, as an example; antiarrhythmic doses can sometimes exceed 1500Â mg/day). The authors did not observe significant safety risks using the low quinidine dose, but urged caution and also pointed out that quinidine interacts with a large number of other medications in dangerous or unpredictable ways. A meta analysis was published referencing only that one study.

Although intravenous quinidine is sometimes used to treat &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; malaria, the future availability of this agent is uncertain.

==Side effects==
Quinidine is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6, and can lead to increased blood levels of lidocaine, beta blockers, opioids, and some antidepressants. Quinidine also inhibits the transport protein P-glycoprotein and so can cause some peripherally acting drugs such as loperamide to have central nervous system side effects, such as respiratory depression, if the two drugs are coadministered.

Quinidine can cause thrombocytopenia, granulomatous hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and &quot;torsades de pointes&quot; (dangerous heart rhythm), and has been largely phased out in favor of other antiarrhythmics. &quot;Torsades&quot; can occur after the first dose. Quinidine-induced thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is mediated by the immune system, and may lead to thrombocytic purpura.

Quinidine intoxication can lead to a collection of symptoms collectively known as cinchonism, with tinnitus (ringing in the ears) being among the most characteristic and common symptoms of this toxicity syndrome.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Quinidine acts as a blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels. Inhibition of the Nav1.5 channel is specifically involved in its antiarrhythmic effects as a class I antiarrhythmic agent. Quinidine also blocks certain voltage-gated potassium channels (e.g., Kv1.4, Kv4.2, hERG, among others), acts as an antimuscarinic and alpha-1 blocker, and is an antimalarial. It is said to be a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor antagonist.

====Mechanism of action====
Like all other class I antiarrhythmic agents, quinidine primarily works by blocking the fast inward sodium current (INa). Quinidine&#x27;s effect on INa is known as a &#x27;use dependent block&#x27;. This means at higher heart rates, the block increases, while at lower heart rates, the block decreases. The effect of blocking the fast inward sodium current causes the phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential to decrease (decreased Vmax).

It seems still efficacious as an IV antimalarial against Plasmodium falciparum. This electrolyte dependent agent also increases action potentials and prolongs the QT interval. 
Quinidine also blocks the slowly inactivating, tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na current, the slow inward calcium current (ICa), the rapid (IKr) and slow (IKs) components of the delayed potassium rectifier current, the inward potassium rectifier current (IKI), the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (IKATP) and Ito.

At micromolar concentrations, quinidine inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase by binding to the same receptor sites as the digitalis glycosides such as ouabain.

The effect of quinidine on the ion channels is to prolong the cardiac action potential, thereby prolonging the QT interval on the surface ECG.

Other ECG effects include a wide notched P wave, wide QRS complex, depressed ST segment, and U waves. These are the results of both slowed depolarization and repolarization.

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Elimination====

The elimination half-life of oral quinidine is 6 to 8Â hours, and it is eliminated by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver. About 20% is excreted unchanged via the kidneys.

==History==
The effects of cinchona bark (the botanical source from which quinidine is extracted) had been commented on long before the understanding of cardiac physiology arose. Jean-Baptiste de SÃ©nac, in his 1749 work on the anatomy, function, and diseases of the heart, had this to say:

&quot;Long and rebellious palpitations have ceded to this febrifuge&quot;.
&quot;Of all the stomachic remedies, the one whose effects have appeared to me the most constant and the most prompt in many cases is quinquina [Peruvian bark] mixed with a little rhubarb.&quot;

SÃ©nac subsequently became physician to Louis XV of France, a counselor of the state, and superintendent of the mineral waters and medicinals in France. As a result of his influence, throughout the 19th century, quinidine was used to augment digitalis therapy. It was described as &quot;das Opium des Herzens&quot; (the opium of the heart).

However, the use of quinidine to treat arrhythmia really only came into its own because a physician listened to the astute observation of one of his patients. In 1912, Karel Frederik Wenckebach saw a man with atrial fibrillation. He was a Dutch merchant, used to good order in his affairs. He would like to have good order in his heart business, also, and asked, &quot;why there were heart specialists if they could not abolish this very disagreeable phenomenon ... he knew himself how to get rid of his attacks. As I did not believe him, he promised to come back next morning with a regular pulse, and he did.&quot;

The man had found by chance that when he took one gram of quinine during an attack, it reliably halted it in 25 minutes; otherwise it would last for two to 14 days. Wenckebach often tried quinine again, but he succeeded in only one other patient.

He made passing mention of it in his book on cardiac arrhythmias published in 1914. Four years later, Walter von Frey of Berlin reported in a leading Viennese medical journal that quinidine was the most effective of the four principal cinchona alkaloids in controlling atrial arrhythmias.

==Chemistry==
Quinidine-based ligands are used in AD-mix-Î² for Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation.

==Veterinary use==
Quinidine sulfate is used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation in horses.

<text>John of Montfort (, ) (1295 â 26 September 1345, ChÃ¢teau d&#x27;Hennebont), sometimes known as John IV of Brittany, and 6th Earl of Richmond from 1341 to his death. He was the son of Arthur II, Duke of Brittany and his second wife, Yolande of Dreux. He contested the inheritance of the Duchy of Brittany with his niece Joan of PenthiÃ¨vre, which led to the War of the Breton Succession, which in turn evolved into being part of the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France. John&#x27;s patron in his quest was King Edward III of England. He died in 1345, 19 years before the end of the war, and the victory of his son John IV over Joan of PenthiÃ¨vre and her husband, Charles of Blois.

== Biography ==

John of Montfort was born in 1295, the only son to Arthur II of Brittany and his second wife Yolande of Dreux. In 1322 he inherited from his mother the title of count of Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury, and in 1329 he married Joanna of Flanders in Chartres. Joanna was the daughter of Louis I, Count of Nevers, and Joan, Countess of Rethel. They had: 
* John IV, Duke of Brittany (1339â1399), married (1) Mary of Waltham (1344â1362), daughter of King Edward III of England, in 1361 in Oxfordshire; (2) Joan Holland (1350â1384) in 1366 in London; (3) Joan of Navarre (1370â1437), daughter of King Charles II of Navarre, in 1386 in SaillÃ©-prÃ¨s-GuÃ©rande.
* Joan of Brittany, Baroness of Drayton (1341â1402), married before 21 October 1385 to Ralph Basset, 3rd Baron Basset of Drayton

==Succession to Duke John III==
On 30 April 1341, John III, Duke of Brittany, died without a male heir. His half-brother, John of Montfort, was a candidate for the succession, which was also claimed by Joan of PenthiÃ¨vre, niece of John III and wife of Charles of Blois, himself a nephew of the Philip VI, King of France. The King was, of course, favourable to his nephew.

The Duchy of Brittany historically had a &quot;semi-Salic&quot; mode of inheritance; male primogeniture was followed unless no direct male descendants remained. At that point the closest female descendant inherited as duchess, with her husband serving as duke by &quot;right of representation&quot;. The position of John of Montfort was legally founded on the belief that a brother (even a half-brother) was a closer heir than a beneficiary niece, and that the Salic form of inheritance adopted by the Kingdom of France should be followed. This argument was based on the fact that since 1297 Brittany had been a &quot;duchÃ©-pairie&quot; (&quot;member and part of the crown&quot;), and that the legislation of the suzerain kingdom should therefore be applied. Challenges to the Salic law of the Franks had historically been rejected for the Kingdom of France, allowing Philip V to gain the throne in 1316, and Philip VI most recently. This made Philip VI&#x27;s support of Joan of PenthiÃ¨vre quite ironic, in that the argument for Philip VI to inherit the Kingdom of France was based on the opposing philosophy that the crown should not be able to descend through the female line to Edward III. 

A civil war, termed the War of the Breton Succession, then began and lasted 23 years. This conflict was also called &quot;La guerre de deux Jeanne&quot;, after the French names of the two duchesses in competition: Jeanne de PenthiÃ¨vre and Jeanne de Flanders, wife of John of Montfort.

==Early stages of the War (1341)==
After the funeral of John III, Charles of Blois returned to the Court of France and John of Montfort returned to his Breton estate in GuÃ©rande. Then, incited by his wife (according to tradition), he went with a small army to Nantes where he was well received by the inhabitants who swore their loyalty. John then went to Limoges where he managed to obtain the ducal treasury. John returned to Nantes and was recognised as Duke in May 1341 by an assembly composed of members of the towns and minor nobles, but shunned by the major vassals with the exception of HervÃ© VII, Count of LÃ©on. Thanks to the ducal treasury, he recruited mercenaries which allowed him to perform in June and July a &#x27;great ride in Brittany&#x27; (as described by Arthur de la Borderie) and take control of the duchy. John first gained Rennes, then Vannes and the places surrounding the ChÃ¢teau de Suscinio, Auray, Hennebont, and then QuimperlÃ©. Having failed to take the domains of Rohan, he submitted Quimper and Brest before descending to Carhaix, and then went back northward and captured Saint-Brieuc, Lamballe, Jugon, Dinan, Dol-de-Bretagne, and returned to Nantes via PloÃ«rmel.

Always accompanied by HervÃ© VII of LÃ©on, John obtained the submission, if not the support, of some of the major nobles who possessed several of these strongholds and had been loyal to Charles of Blois. However it would probably require getting Josselin, or the support of the high secular clergy and great lords, or more, to control the domains of the PenthiÃ¨vres and the House of Rohan, which represented about two-thirds of Brittany. John also went to England and met with Edward III of England in Windsor, who promised him military assistance and invested him with the Honour of Richmond.

Charles of Blois then made an appeal to Philip VI, who summoned John of Montfort to a Court of Peers session in Conflans in September 1341. In this context by the judgment of Conflans, the Duchy of Brittany was attributed to Charles of Blois. Philip VI agreed to receive &quot;l&#x27;hommage lige&quot; of Charles of Blois on behalf of his wife, and confiscated from John of Montfort the French lands of the County of Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury, as well as the Viscounty of Limoges that he held more unduly.

In October 1341, Charles of Blois and John II, Duke of Normandy (later King of France), put together an army and penetrated into Brittany. They managed to retrieve a number of strongholds which had been lost, including Nantes, which relented on 21 November 1341 after three weeks of siege. John of Montfort was captured and imprisoned in the Louvre in Paris. Despite the change of camp of HervÃ© VII de Leon (due to criticisms from John regarding his handling of the siege of Nantes), Joanna, the wife of John of Montfort, continued the armed struggle supported by his allies.

==Subsequent stages of the War (1342â1345)==
After a winter break that ended on 15 April 1342, Charles of Blois resumed the fight and regained a large part of Brittany between May and September 1342. King Edward III of England decided to intervene on behalf of the House of Montfort. Charles de Blois failed to take Hennebont, which was defended by Joanna of Flanders, while Robert III of Artois was mortally wounded besieging Vannes in vain leading an English contingent. In January 1343, through Pope Clement VI, a truce was signed at Malestroit to bring peace and the liberation of John of Montfort. The latter was released in September 1343 and retired to England 27 March 1345. His return to the struggle with reinforcements provided by King Edward III of England put an end to the truce. John of Montfort unsuccessfully laid siege to Quimper, then fell ill and died in Hennebont on 26 September 1345.

==Tomb of John of Monfort==
He was buried in the convent of the Dominicans of QuimperlÃ© where his tomb, which had already been desecrated, was found again in December 1883. His remains are now in the Church of Sainte-Croix de QuimperlÃ©.

<text>Charles of Blois-ChÃ¢tillon (131929 September 1364), nicknamed &quot;the Saint&quot;, was the legalist Duke of Brittany from 1341 until his death, via his marriage to Joan, Duchess of Brittany and Countess of PenthiÃ¨vre, holding the title against the claims of John of Montfort. The cause of his possible canonization was the subject of a good deal of political maneuvering on the part of his cousin, Charles V of France, who endorsed it, and his rival, John of Montfort, who opposed it. The cause fell dormant after Pope Gregory XI left Avignon in 1376, but was revived in 1894. Charles of Blois was beatified in 1904.

==Biography==
Charles was born in Blois, the son of Guy de ChÃ¢tillon, count of Blois, by Margaret of Valois, a sister of King Philip VI of France. A devout ascetic from an early age, he showed interest in religious books but was forbidden from reading them by his father, as they did not seem appropriate to his position as a knight. As he grew older, Charles took piety to the extreme of mortifying his own flesh. It is said that he placed pebbles in his shoes, slept on straw instead of a bed, confessed every night in fear of sleeping in a state of sin, and wore a cilice under his armor in battle. He was nevertheless an accomplished military leader, who inspired loyalty by his religious fervour.

===Marriage===
On 4 June 1337 in Paris, he married Joan the Lame, heiress and niece of John III, Duke of Brittany. 

===Breton War of Succession===
Together, Charles and his wife, Joan of PenthiÃ¨vre, fought the House of Montfort in the Breton War of Succession (1341â1364), with the support of the crown of France. Despite his piety, Charles did not hesitate in ordering the massacre of 1,400 civilians after the siege of Quimper as well as the massacre of thousands after the siege of Guerande. After initial successes, Charles was taken prisoner by the English in 1347. His official captor was Thomas Dagworth. 

He stayed nine years as prisoner in the Kingdom of England. During that time, he used to visit English graveyards, where he prayed and recited Psalm 130, much to the chagrin of his own squire. When Charles asked the squire to take part in the prayer, the younger man refused, saying that the men who were buried at the English graveyards had killed his parents and friends and burned their houses.

Charles was released against a ransom of about half a million Ã©cus in 1356. Upon returning to France, he decided to travel barefoot in winter from La Roche-Derrien to TrÃ©guier Cathedral out of devotion to Saint Ivo of Kermartin. When the common people heard of his plan, they placed straw and blankets on the street, but Charles promptly took another way. His feet became so sore that he could not walk for 15 weeks. He then resumed the war against the Montforts. 

Charles was eventually killed in combat during the Battle of Auray in 1364, which with the second treaty of Guerande in 1381 determined the end of the Breton War of Succession as a victory for the Montforts.

==Family==
By his marriage to Joan the Lame, Countess of PenthiÃ¨vre, he had five children:
* John I, Count of PenthiÃ¨vre (1340â1404) and Viscount of Limoges.
* Guy
* Henry (d. 1400)
* Marie of Blois, Duchess of Anjou (1345â1404), Lady of Guise, married in 1360 to Louis I, Duke of Anjou
* Margaret of Blois, Countess of AngoulÃªme, married in 1351 to Charles de la Cerda (d. 1354), the Count of AngoulÃªme and Constable of France.

According to Froissart&#x27;s Chronicles, Charles also had an illegitimate child, John of Blois, who died in the Battle of Auray. However, considering Charles&#x27; extreme piety, historian Johan Huizinga regarded it unlikely that Charles actually had a child born outside marriage and that Jean Froissart was probably mistaken in identifying John as Charles&#x27; son.

==Veneration==
Charles was buried at Guingamp, where the Franciscans actively promoted his unapproved cult as saint and martyr. Such variety of &quot;ex votos&quot; bedecked his tomb, that in 1368 Duke John IV of Brittany persuaded Pope Urban V to issue a bull directing the Breton bishops to stop this. But the bishops failed to enforce it.

Nonetheless, his family successfully lobbied for his canonization as a Saint of the Roman Catholic church for his devotion to religion. Bending to pressure from Charles V of France, Pope Urban authorized a commission to study the matter. Urban died December 1370 to be succeeded by Pope Gregory XI. The commission held its first meeting in Angers in September 1371, and forwarded its report to Avignon the following January. Gregory appointed three cardinals to review the matter. The Pope returned to Italy in September 1376, arriving in Rome in November 1377; he died the following March. Gregory was succeeded in Avignon by Clement VII, but the documents were probably in Rome with Pope Urban VI. There appears to be no record of further activity regarding Charles&#x27; cause for canonization at this time. In 1454, Charles&#x27; grandson urged his relatives to continue to advocate for his recognition.

The process was re-opened in 1894, and on 14 December 1904, Charles de ChÃ¢tillon was beatified as &quot;Blessed Charles of Blois&quot;. His feast Day is 30 September.

<text>John IV the Conqueror KG (in Breton Yann IV, in French Jean IV, and traditionally in English sources both John of Montfort and John V) (1339 â 1 November 1399), was Duke of Brittany and Count of Montfort from 1345 until his death and 7th Earl of Richmond from 1372 until his death.

==Ordinal number==
He was the son of John of Montfort and Joanna of Flanders. His father claimed the title Duke of Brittany, but was largely unable to enforce his claim for more than a brief period. Because his father&#x27;s claim to the title was disputed, with only the English king recognising it, the subject of this article is often numbered in French sources as &quot;John IV&quot; and his father as simply &quot;John of Montfort&quot; (&quot;Jean de Montfort&quot;), while in English sources he is known as &quot;John V&quot;. However, the epithet of &quot;The Conqueror&quot; makes his identity unambiguous.

==Conquest==
The first part of his rule was tainted by the Breton War of Succession, fought by his father against his cousin Joanna of PenthiÃ¨vre and her husband Charles of Blois. With French military support Charles was able to control most of Brittany. After his father&#x27;s death, John&#x27;s mother Joanne attempted to continue the war in the name of her baby son. She became known as &quot;Jeanne la Flamme&quot; (Fiery Joanna) for her fiery personality. However, she was eventually forced to retreat with her son to England to ask for the aid of Edward III. She was later declared insane and imprisoned in Tickhill Castle in 1343. John and his sister Joan of Brittany were taken into the King&#x27;s household afterwards.

John returned to Brittany to enforce his claim, with English help. In 1364, John won a decisive victory against the House of Blois in the Battle of Auray, with the support of the English army led by John Chandos. His rival Charles was killed in the battle and Charles&#x27;s widow Joanna was forced to sign the Treaty GuÃ©rande on 12 April 1365. In the terms of the treaty, Joanna gave up her rights to Brittany and recognized John as sole master of the duchy.

==Power struggles==
Having achieved victory with English support (and having married into the English royal family), Duke John IV was constrained to confirm several English barons in positions of power within Brittany, especially as controllers of strategically important strongholds in the environs of the port of Brest, which gave the English military access to the peninsula, and which took revenue from Brittany to the English crown. This English power-base in Brittany was resented by the Breton aristocrats and the French monarchy, as was John&#x27;s use of English advisers. However, John IV declared himself a vassal to king Charles V of France, not to Edward III of England. Nevertheless, this gesture did not placate his critics, who saw the presence of rogue English troops and lords as destabilizing. Faced with the defiance of the Breton nobility, John IV was unable to muster military support against King Charles V, who took the opportunity to exert pressure over Brittany. Without local support, in 1373, he was once more forced into exile to England.

However, King Charles V made the mistake of attempting to completely adjoin the duchy of Brittany to France. Bertrand de Guesclin was sent to make the duchy submit to the French king by force of arms in 1378. The Breton barons revolted against the takeover and invited Duke John IV back from exile in 1379. He landed in Dinard and took control of the duchy once more with the support of local barons. An English army under Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, landed at Calais and marched towards Nantes to take control of the city. However, John IV subsequently reconciled with the new French king, Charles VI of France, and paid off the English troops to avoid a confrontation. He ruled his duchy thereafter in peace with the French and English crowns for over a decade, maintaining contact with both, but minimizing open links to England. Between 1380 and 1385, John IV built the ChÃ¢teau de l&#x27;Hermine (&quot;Castle of Hermine&quot;) in Vannes, which became a defensive fortress and dwelling for the Dukes of Brittany. He built it in order to benefit from the central position of the city of Vannes in his duchy. In 1397, Duke John IV finally managed to extricate Brest from English control by using diplomatic pressure and financial inducements.

==Clisson affair== 
In 1392 an attempt was made to kill Olivier V de Clisson, the Constable of France, in Paris who was an old enemy of the duke&#x27;s. The attacker, Pierre de Craon, fled to Brittany. John was assumed to be behind the plot, and Charles VI took the opportunity to attack Brittany once more. Accompanied by the Constable, he marched on Brittany, but before he reached the duchy the king was seized with madness. Relatives of Charles VI blamed Clisson, and instituted legal proceedings against him to undermine his political position. Stripped of his status as Constable, Clisson now took refuge in Brittany himself, and was reconciled with John (1397), becoming a close adviser to the duke.

==English knighthood==
John IV was knighted by King Edward III between 1375 and 1376 as a member of the Order of the Garter. He is believed to be the only Duke of Brittany to have attained this English honour.

==Family==

===Marriages===
Duke John IV married three times: 
:1) Mary of England (1344â1362), daughter of King Edward III and Philippa of Hainault.
:2) Lady Joan Holland (1350â1384), daughter of Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent and Joan of Kent, in London, in May 1366.
:3) Joan of Navarre (1370â1437), daughter of King Charles II of Navarre and Joan of Valois, at SaillÃ©-prÃ¨s-GuÃ©rande, near Nantes, on 2 October 1386.
Joan of Navarre was the mother of all of John&#x27;s children. After his death, she served as Regent to their son, John V, Duke of Brittany, and eventually married King Henry IV of England.

<text>Usucaption (), also known as &quot;acquisitive prescription&quot;, is a concept found in civil law systems and has its origin in the Roman law of property.

Usucaption is a method by which ownership of property (i.e. title to the property) can be gained by possession of it beyond the lapse of a certain period of time (acquiescence). While usucaption has been compared with adverse possession, the true effect of usucaption is to remedy defects in title of lands that are without encumbrance on them.

==History==
===Roman law===

====Background to usucaption====

The necessity for usucaption arose in Roman law with the divide between &quot;res mancipi&quot; and &quot;res nec mancipi&quot;. &quot;Res mancipi&quot; required elaborate and inconvenient formal methods of conveyance to transfer title (a formal &quot;mancipatio&quot; ceremony, or &quot;in iure cessio&quot;). &quot;Res nec manicipi&quot; could be transferred by &quot;traditio&quot; (delivery) or &quot;in iure cessio&quot;.

The remaining form of conveyance was &quot;traditio&quot;. This was an informal conveyance which only required the intention to transfer and delivery of the property. If &quot;res mancipi&quot; were transferred by &quot;traditio&quot;, full ownership would not pass and the recipient would become a bonitary owner.

Therefore, another form of conveyance was required that did not necessitate a ceremony or appearance before the praetor. Because Rome was becoming mercantile, it was simply inconvenient to perform a formal conveyance simply because property was classed as &quot;res mancipi&quot;. There might also be a demand to transfer property in private between the transferring parties, such as in the establishment of &quot;fideicommissa&quot; (Roman trusts).

The need for establishing ownership by means other than conveyance was also a result of the practical defect of a system of ownership based on valid transfer. Title to property could be challenged under this system, because it depended on the good title of the person from whom you acquired the property and so on. If any person&#x27;s title in the chain were challenged successfully, then this would defeat any title derived from it. This defect required a means of establishing ownership that was not contingent upon a chain of title but could be established independently.

====The Roman Law of Usucapio====
However, if a bonitary owner kept the &quot;res&quot; (property) in his possession for a certain amount of time (two years for land, one year for chattels) his title would become full title and he could assert himself as &quot;dominus&quot;.

Usucaption was the solution that emerged to address the defects of Roman ownership. It required five elements:

# Uninterrupted possession of the property for the requisite period (one year for chattels, two years for land);
# The property was capable of being owned. Not a free man for example;
# Good faith. For example, a buyer might purchase a slave (categorised as res mancipi) in good faith but find twelve months on that the vendor did not himself have good title to that slave;
# &quot;Iusta causa&quot;. A proper ground for acquiring the property, e.g. showing that the acquirer paid for the property.
# The property must not have been stolen any time or taken by force.

This largely ameliorated the problems experienced by conveyance as a means of establishing ownership, but could still yield harsh results. A purchaser of res mancipi could be on his way to successfully usucaping the property (e.g. 11 months in possession) but would lose his claim to it if his possession was challenged before the period of usucaption by someone who could establish title.

Usucaption was altered by the Actio Publiciana (see Gaius 4.36) which gave scope in the vindicatio (the action for property) for a fictitious usucaption. Such a situation would only arise where the claimant&#x27;s possession of the property had been interrupted before the period required to usucape it had elapsed. The Actio Publiciana made provision for the possessor of the property to be taken to have usucaped it successfully, if he could show that he would have usucaped the property had his possession of it not been interrupted. In this way usucaption became the dominant form of establishing ownership in Rome.

===In Rabbinic Judaism===

In orthodox Jewish law, the right of usucaption is defined in a compendium of Oral Laws compiled in 189 CE, known as the Mishnah (&quot;Baba Bathra&quot; 3:1-ff.). The general scope of the law formerly provided for the right of possession of property in the absence of a legal deed or title, if, after three years of occupancy, no protest or counter-claim had been made to the same property.

Title by usucaption to houses, cisterns, trenches, vaults, dovecots, bath-houses, olive-presses, irrigated fields, and slaves, and aught that brings constant gain, is secured by occupation during three completed years; title by usucaption to unirrigated fields [is secured by occupation during] three years and they need not be completed.

If a dispute had arisen over property within this three-year time-frame, the property is assumed to belong to the person who challenges the claim of the illegal tenant, particularly, when the other is publicly known to have originally possessed the land or house. In such cases, if so-and-so &quot;A&quot; claimed that so-and-so &quot;B&quot; wrongfully took possession of his property, but so-and-so &quot;B&quot; retorted, &quot;Yes, it was formerly yours, but you sold it to me,&quot; or &quot;Yes, it was formerly yours, but I received it from you as a gift,&quot; - if &quot;A&quot; is known to have once possessed the property, he is assumed to be the rightful owner of the property, and it is the duty of &quot;B&quot; to show proof that &quot;A&quot; either sold it to him, or gave it to him as a gift. The absence of proof renders &quot;B&quot;&#x27;s hold of the property null and void.

A squatter who fences in the property, or who locks it up, or who refurbishes it, or who has the keys to the property delivered unto him, are all signs of legal conveyance and is assumed to be the rightful owner, even in the absence of a legal deed. After three years of occupancy the squatter cannot be evicted from the property, unless the original owner can show proof or bring witnesses who testify to the effect that the property is still vested in his name, and that no transaction, conveyance or sale was made between him and the squatter, even though he held it for three years or more, in which case the squatter is forcibly evicted from the property and the court replevins the estate to its rightful owner. The application of this law is similar to what was found in ancient Roman law, under &quot;rei vindicatio&quot;.

Three years was considered the least amount of time needed for a &quot;rei vindicatio&quot; to happen, meaning, one year being the time needed for the discovery of the illegal occupant, another year being the time needed to notify the original owner about his property being taken, and another year being the time needed for him to return to the Land of Israel from a far-away country, such as Spain, in order to evict the occupant. The protest must be made before at least two competent witnesses and submitted in a court of law against another&#x27;s wrongful occupation of his property within the three-year allotted period, in which case the squatter&#x27;s assumed right to the said property is automatically canceled, unless he can provide proof of purchase. The squatter who fails to provide a legal deed of purchase, or who lost his deed of purchase, forfeits his hold of the property. The language of protestation by the rightful owner is such, or to the effect of such: &quot;So-and-so, who is making use of my courtyard or my field, is a thief.&quot; The person who protests another man&#x27;s wrongful hold of his property must be known by others to be the rightful owner of that property, and if not, the squatter is able to say, &quot;I take no heed to his protestations.&quot;

Title by usucaption in the above cases does not apply to persons who had been artisans working on the property in question, or to persons who had been co-partners in business with the original owner, or to persons who had been sharecroppers on the property in question, or to persons who had acted as legal guardian of the original owner, nor can title by usucaption apply to a man when it comes to his wife&#x27;s property, or vice-versa, when his wife comes to claim her husband&#x27;s property. 

The Jewish custom in Jerusalem during Ottoman rule over Palestine was that wherever it was widely known by the public that a fellow Jew had been deprived of his property under the land tenure laws known as &quot;MÃ¼lk&quot; (where Jewish-owned land was given by the Ottoman conqueror to Muslims, or Khuraj lands given to Christians and taxed, in exchange for Muslim protection, which same lands became private or allodial land, held in absolute ownership), the usurping occupant was divested of his property and the property returned to its rightful owner, even if the owner could not show proof of purchase.

<text>Philippe de La Hire (or Lahire, La Hyre or Phillipe de La Hire) (18 March 1640 â 21 April 1718) was a French painter, mathematician, astronomer, and architect. According to Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle he was an &quot;academy unto himself&quot;.

He was born in Paris, the son of Laurent de La Hire, a distinguished artist and Marguerite Coquin. In 1660, he moved to Venice for four years to study painting. Upon his return to Paris, he became a disciple of Girard Desargues from whom he learned geometrical perspective and was received as a master painter on 4 August 1670. His paintings have sometimes been confused with those of his son, Jean Nicolas de La Hire, who was a doctor but also a painter.

He also began to study science and showed an aptitude for mathematics. He was taught by the French Jesuit theologian, mathematician, physicist and controversialist HonorÃ© Fabri and became part of a circle formed by Fabri which included Giovanni Domenico Cassini, Claude FranÃ§ois Milliet Dechales, Christiaan Huygens and his brother Constantijn, Gottfried Leibniz, RenÃ© Descartes and Marin Mersenne. He became a member of French Academy of Sciences in 1678, upon the death of Jacques Buot, and subsequently became active as an astronomer, calculating tables of the movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets and designing contrivances for aiming aerial telescopes. From 1679â1682 he made several observations and measurements of the French coastline, and in 1683 aided in mapping France by extending the Paris meridian to the north. In 1683 La Hire assumed the chair of mathematics at the CollÃ¨ge Royal. From 1687 onwards he taught at the AcadÃ©mie dâarchitecture.

La Hire wrote on graphical methods, 1673; on conic sections, 1685; a treatise on epicycloids, 1694; one on roulettes, 1702; and, lastly, another on conchoids, 1708. His works on conic sections and epicycloids were based on the teaching of Desargues, of whom he was the favourite pupil. He also translated the essay of Manuel Moschopulus on magic squares, and collected many of the theorems on them which were previously known; this was published in 1705. He also published a set of astronomical tables in 1702. La Hire&#x27;s work also extended to descriptive zoology, the study of respiration, and physiological optics.

Two of his sons were also notable for their scientific achievements: Gabriel-Philippe de La Hire, (1677â1719), mathematician, and (1685â1727), botanist.

Mons La Hire, a mountain on the Moon, is named for him.

On 19 December 1699, he presented âExpÃ©riences et observations sur les corps qui frottent lâun contre lâautreâ (Experiments and observations on bodies that slide against each other) at the AcadÃ©mie Royale des Sciences in Paris, where he proposed what are now commonly known as Amontonsâ laws of friction after Guillaume Amontons.

<doc id="640418" wikidata="Q454013" url="?curid=640418" title="John V, Duke of Brittany">
<text>John V, sometimes numbered as VI, (24 December 1389 â 29 August 1442) bynamed John the Wise (; ), was Duke of Brittany and Count of Montfort from 1399 to his death. His rule coincided with the height of the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France. John&#x27;s reversals in that conflict, as well as in other internal struggles in France, served to strengthen his duchy and to maintain its independence.

His alternative regnal name, John VI, as he is known traditionally in old English sources, comes from English partisan accounting as to who was the rightful duke of Brittany during the War of the Breton Succession (1341â65), which had preceded the rule of his father. Although he faced problems which had lingered from it, his rule as duke was mostly unchallenged. Without significant internal and foreign threats, John V reinforced ducal authority, reformed the military, constructed a coherent method of taxation, and established diplomatic and trade contacts with most of Western Europe.

John V was also a patron of the arts and the Church, and funded the construction of several cathedrals. He is known for creating the &quot;LycÃ©e Lesage&quot; in Vannes.

==Life==
John V was born on 24 December 1389 at the ChÃ¢teau de l&#x27;Hermine as the eldest son of John IV, Duke of Brittany, and Princess Joan of Navarre. He became Duke of Brittany in 1399 when he was still a minor upon the death of his father. His mother served as regent in the initial portion of his reign.

Unlike his father, John V inherited the duchy in peace, as the end of the Breton War of Succession and John IV&#x27;s military conquests in Brittany promised. However, his father&#x27;s rivals for the duchy, the Pentheiveres, continued to plot against him. Furthermore, John had to secure the peace of the duchy during an unstable period culminating in King Henry V of England&#x27;s invasion of France.

===Early career===

He became duke at the age of ten, and began his reign under the tutelage of Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Bold, who was ravaging nearby Jersey and Guernsey. He made peace with the king of France, Charles VI, whose daughter, Joan of France, he married. He also reconciled with the powerful magnate Olivier de Clisson, formerly an enemy of his father. In 1404, he defeated a French force near Brest. A potential conflict with Clisson was averted by the latter&#x27;s death. 

When Henry V invaded France, John was initially allied to the French. However, he missed the Battle of Agincourt. His brother Arthur de Richemont participated, though, and was captured and imprisoned by the English. The confusion in the aftermath of the battle allowed John to seize Saint-Malo which had been annexed by the French. He then adopted a policy of switching between the two parties, English and French. He signed the Treaty of Troyes, which made Henry V heir to France, but he allowed his brother Arthur de Richemont to fight for the French.

===Abduction by the Counts of PenthiÃ¨vre===
The Counts of PenthiÃ¨vre had lost the Breton War of Succession (1341â1364) in which they had claimed the ducal title of Brittany from John&#x27;s grandfather, John of Montfort. The war ended in 1364 in a military victory for John&#x27;s father, in which the PenthiÃ¨vre claimant, Charles of Blois, died. His widow, Joanna, Countess of PenthiÃ¨vre, was forced to sign the Treaty of GuÃ©rande which concluded the conflict. The treaty stated that PenthiÃ¨vres accepted the Montforts&#x27;s right to the dukedom, but if they failed to produce a male heir the duchy would revert to the PenthiÃ¨vres. 

Despite the military loss and the diplomatic treaty, the Counts of PenthiÃ¨vre had not renounced their direct ducal claims to Brittany and continued to pursue them. In 1420, they invited John V to a festival held at ChÃ¢tonceaux. John came and was arrested. Olivier, Count of PenthiÃ¨vre and his mother, Margaret de Clisson, then spread rumours of his death and moved him to a new prison each day. John&#x27;s wife, Joan of France, called upon all the barons of Brittany to respond. They besieged all the castles of the PenthiÃ¨vre family one by one. 

Joan ended the crisis by seizing the dowager countess of PenthiÃ¨vre and forcing her to free the duke. After the release, the ChÃ¢tonceaux citadel was completely destroyed and the name changed to Champtoceaux. As a result of this failed imprisonment, Olivier had his county confiscated by the duke and he was forced into exile. In addition, the Montforts declared that the Treaty of GuÃ©rande had been broken and that the PenthiÃ¨vre family no longer had a claim to the throne, even upon the extinction of the Montfort line. This ensured that Anne of Brittany succeeded to the duchy at the end of the century.

===Policy in the Hundred Years&#x27; War===

After the English defeat at the Battle of BaugÃ©, John V ditched his allies by signing a treaty with the Dauphin Charles at SablÃ© on May 1421. Some of its provisions were that John would abandon his commitments to the English, while Charles would dismiss his councillors who had advised him to support the PenthiÃ¨vre revolt. Initial Breton military support to Charles proved significant: in the Dauphin&#x27;s Loire valley campaign in the summer of 1421, the duchy provided more than a third of his army, about the same as the Scots. However, the agreement was soon undermined, as both parties failed to completely fulfill their promises. Furthermore, the release of John&#x27;s brother Arthur from English captivity, along with subsequent English military successes (particularly at the Siege of Meaux), convinced John to once again reverse his allegiance, by signing the Treaty of Amiens (1423) with England and Burgundy.

The Amiens agreement also proved ephemeral. Brittany and Burgundy had secretly agreed to maintain good relations with each other if any of them abandoned the English. Arthur de Richemont soon defected to the Dauphin, and was made Constable of France. The duke of Brittany was convinced to do the same; by signing the Treaty of Saumur on 7 October 1425, John V once again allied with Charles, to which England responded with a formal declaration of war on 15 January 1426. An English incursion into Breton territory led by Sir Thomas Rempston was subsequently made. After failing to defeat the much smaller English force at the Battle of St. James, and now under threat of a full-scale assault by the English, John V once again reconciled with them by adhering to yet another agreement on 8 September 1427, on which he reaffirmed his support for the Treaty of Troyes and recognised Henry VI of England as king of France. As a gesture of allegiance to the Anglo-French dual monarchy, he sent his younger and favourite son Gilles to England to grow up in Henry&#x27;s household. Gilles and Henry would become close friends over time. Richemont would remain committed to the Dauphin&#x27;s cause for the rest of the war, however, though John V&#x27;s defection in 1427 contributed to the former&#x27;s expulsion from the French court.

John&#x27;s allegiance with England had remained fickle and became ambiguous in the early 1430s, especially due to clashes between English and Breton sailors, though relations were kept afloat due to lengthy negotiations and a growing friendship between King Henry VI and the duke&#x27;s younger son Gilles. Even after the Anglo-Burgundian alliance ended in 1435, he remained formally aligned to the English cause, though in effect adopting a policy of careful neutrality, attempting to become friendly with the French and willing to broker a peace between both parties. However, John took part in the Praguerie revolt in 1440 against Charles VII, and signed a neutrality agreement on 11 July 1440 with the English, by which he promised not to give shelter to England&#x27;s enemies.

Relations between England and Brittany eventually collapsed due to bad diplomacy and English raids into Breton territory in 1443 and 1449. Consequent political maneuvers resulted in the murder of John V&#x27;s Anglophile younger son Gilles on 24 April 1450. When a truce between the French and English was arranged at the Treaty of Tours in 1444, Brittany was not listed by the English as an ally. By then, John V had already died, and his son and successor Francis I would subsequently pay homage to Charles VII on 16 March 1446, thereby formally ending any Breton support for the English.

===Later life===

While captured by the English, John II, Duke of AlenÃ§on had sold his fiefdom of FougÃ¨res to John V in order to raise the ransom for his release. After AlenÃ§on&#x27;s release, his attempts to recover his territories led to conflict. John surrounded AlenÃ§on&#x27;s fortress during the Siege of PouancÃ© (1432). Arthur de Richemont, his brother, who accompanied him, induced him to make peace.

Working with Bishop Jean de Malestroit, he began the construction of a new cathedral in Nantes, placing the first stone in April 1434.

He died on 29 August 1442, at the Manoir de la Touche, owned by the Bishop of Nantes. 

A statue of the Duke of polychrome wood is in the chapel of Saint-Fiacre in FaouÃ«t. His tomb in TrÃ©guier cathedral was destroyed. It was replaced by a new one in the 20th century.

==Family==
John V married Joan of France, daughter of King Charles VI &quot;the Mad&quot; and his wife Isabeau of Bavaria. By her he had seven children:

<text>Elm Park is a London Underground station serving Elm Park in the London Borough of Havering, east London. It is on the District line between and . It is along the line from the eastern terminus at and to in central London where the line divides into numerous branches.

The station was opened on 18 May 1935 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on the local electrified tracks between Upminster and Barking that were constructed in 1932. The station is of a similar design to those constructed at and and was the last infill station to be opened on the eastern extension.

==History==
The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway constructed a line from Barking to Pitsea through the Elm Park area in 1885, with stations at Dagenham and Hornchurch. The Whitechapel and Bow Railway opened in 1902 and allowed through services of the District Railway to operate to Upminster. The Metropolitan District converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were cut back to East Ham. Delayed by World War I, electrified tracks were extended by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to Upminster and through services resumed in 1932. The District Railway was incorporated into London Transport in 1933, and became known as the District line.

The infill station was officially opened by Hilton Young on 18 May 1935. It opened with a passimeter for quick sale of tickets and in the off peak collection of tickets from one side and sale from the other. A ticket collectors position was provided with stable door, now a bin store. A ticket office was also provided to deal with parcels and also had the electrical fuses and switches. Now a shop, switch room, and computer room. The station had central heating supplied by a coal boiler under the booking hall, a coal chute from a street manhole was used to supply coal. The boiler was later converted to gas, all removed when the new ticket office was built opposite for the Underground ticket system.

The station was the last to be opened on an existing London Underground line (rather than as part of an extension or new line) until Wood Lane on the Hammersmith and City line in 2008.

==Design==
The station is of similar design to Dagenham Heathway and Upney, but the station canopy is supported by one central pillar and the ramp to the ticket hall is much wider. The platforms are arranged on an island layout with station buildings typical of the 1930s. A long sloping walkway connects the platforms with the ticket hall which is on a road bridge over the line and above general street level.

==Location==
The station is named after the mid-1930s planned community of Elm Park, in which it is situated. It is located on The Broadway in the London Borough of Havering. The immediate area is a busy, compact shopping district surrounded by extensive residential development to the north and south.

==Services and connections==
The station is in London fare zone 6. The typical off-peak service from the station is twelve District line trains per hour to Upminster and twelve to Earl&#x27;s Court, of which six continue to Ealing Broadway and six continue to Richmond. At peak periods the number of trains per hour increases to fifteen and some trains continue from Earl&#x27;s Court to Wimbledon. Services towards central London operate from approximately 05:00 to 23:45 and services to Upminster operate from approximately 06:00 to 01:30. The journey time to Upminster is seven minutes; to Barking is approximately thirteen minutes, and to Tower Hill is approximately 38 minutes.

London Buses routes 165, 252, 365 and 372 serve the station, providing connections to Collier Row, Havering Park, Hornchurch, Lakeside Shopping Centre, Orchard Village, Rainham and Romford.

<doc id="640422" wikidata="Q865920" url="?curid=640422" title="Approximation error">
<text>The approximation error in a data value is the discrepancy between an exact value and some approximation to it. This error can be expressed as an absolute error (the numerical amount of the discrepancy) or as a relative error (the absolute error divided by the data value).

An approximation error can occur for a variety of reasons, among them a computing machine precision or measurement error (e.g. the length of a piece of paper is 4.53Â cm but the ruler only allows you to estimate it to the nearest 0.1Â cm, so you measure it as 4.5Â cm).

In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, the numerical stability of an algorithm indicates the extent to which errors in the input of the algorithm will lead to large errors of the output; numerically stable algorithms do not yield a significant error in output when the input is malformed and vice versa.

==Formal definition==
Given some value &quot;v&quot;, we say that &quot;v&quot;approx approximates &quot;v&quot; with absolute error &quot;Îµ&quot;&gt;0 if 

:formula_1 

where the vertical bars denote the absolute value. 

We say that &quot;v&quot;approx approximates &quot;v&quot; with relative error &quot;Î·&quot;&gt;0 ifformula_2.If &quot;v&quot; â  0, then
:formula_3.

The percent error (an expression of the relative error) is 

:formula_4

An error bound is an upper limit on the relative or absolute size of an approximation error.

==Examples==

As an example, if the exact value is 50 and the approximation is 49.9, then the absolute error is 0.1 and the relative error is 0.1/50 = 0.002 = 0.2%. As a practical example, when measuring a 6Â mL beaker, the value read was 5Â mL. The correct reading being 6Â mL, this means the percent error in that particular situation is, rounded, 16.7%.

The relative error is often used to compare approximations of numbers of widely differing size; for example, approximating the number 1,000 with an absolute error of 3 is, in most applications, much worse than approximating the number 1,000,000 with an absolute error of 3; in the first case the relative error is 0.003 while in the second it is onlyÂ 0.000003.

There are two features of relative error that should be kept in mind. First, relative error is undefined when the true value is zero as it appears in the denominator (see below). Second, relative error only makes sense when measured on a ratio scale, (i.e. a scale which has a true meaningful zero), otherwise it is sensitive to the measurement units. For example, when an absolute error in a temperature measurement given in Celsius scale is 1Â Â°C, and the true value is 2Â Â°C, the relative error is 0.5. But if the exact same approximation is made with the Kelvin scale, a 1Â K absolute error with the same true value of 275.15Â K = 2Â Â°C gives a relative error of 3.63.

== Comparison ==
Statements about &quot;relative errors&quot; are sensitive to addition of constants, but not to multiplication by constants. For &quot;absolute errors&quot;, the opposite is true: are sensitive to multiplication by constants, but not to addition of constants.

== Polynomial-time approximation of real numbers ==
We say that a real value &quot;v&quot; is polynomially computable with absolute error from an input if, for every rational number &quot;Îµ&quot;&gt;0, it is possible to compute a rational number &quot;v&quot;approx that approximates &quot;v&quot; with absolute error &quot;Îµ&quot;, in time polynomial in the size of the input and the encoding size of &quot;Îµ&quot; (which is O(log(1/&quot;Îµ&quot;)). Analogously, &quot;v&quot; is polynomially computable with relative error if, for every rational number &quot;Î·&quot;&gt;0, it is possible to compute a rational number &quot;v&quot;approx that approximates &quot;v&quot; with relative error &quot;Î·&quot;, in time polynomial in the size of the input and the encoding size of &quot;Î·&quot;. 

If &quot;v&quot; is polynomially computable with relative error (by some algorithm called REL), then it is also polynomially computable with absolute error. &quot;Proof&quot;. Let &quot;Îµ&quot;&gt;0 be the desired absolute error. First, use REL with relative error &quot;Î·=&quot;1/2; find a rational number &quot;r&quot;1 such that |&quot;v&quot;-&quot;r&quot;1| â¤ |&quot;v&quot;|/2, and hence &quot;|v|&quot; â¤ 2 |&quot;r&quot;1|. If &quot;r&quot;1=0, then &quot;v&quot;=0 and we are done. Since REL is polynomial, the encoding length of &quot;r&quot;1 is polynomial in the input. Now, run REL again with relative error &quot;Î·=Îµ/&quot;(2 &quot;|r&quot;1|). This yields a rational number &quot;r&quot;2 that satisfies |&quot;v&quot;-&quot;r&quot;2| â¤ &quot;Îµ|v&quot;| / (2&quot;r&quot;1) â¤ &quot;Îµ&quot;, so it has absolute error &quot;Îµ&quot; as wished.

The reverse implication is usually not true. But, if we assume that some positive lower bound on |v| can be computed in polynomial time, e.g. |&quot;v&quot;| &gt; &quot;b&quot; &gt; 0, and &quot;v&quot; is polynomially computable with absolute error (by some algorithm called ABS), then it is also polynomially computable with relative error, since we can simply call ABS with absolute error &quot;Îµ = Î· b.&quot; 

An algorithm that, for every rational number &quot;Î·&quot;&gt;0, computes a rational number &quot;v&quot;approx that approximates &quot;v&quot; with relative error &quot;Î·&quot;, in time polynomial in the size of the input and 1/&quot;Î·&quot; (rather than log(1/&quot;Î·&quot;)), is called an FPTAS. 

==Instruments==
In most indicating instruments, the accuracy is guaranteed to a certain percentage of full-scale reading. The limits of these deviations from the specified values are known as limiting errors or guarantee errors.

== Generalizations ==

The definitions can be extended to the case when formula_5 and formula_6 are &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vectors, by replacing the absolute value with an &quot;n&quot;-norm.

<doc id="640424" wikidata="Q472719" url="?curid=640424" title="Francis I, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Francis I (in Breton Fransez I, in French FranÃ§ois I) (11 May 1414 â 17 July 1450), was Duke of Brittany, Count of Montfort and titular Earl of Richmond, from 29 August 1442 to his death. He was born in Vannes, the son of John V, Duke of Brittany and Joan of France, the daughter of King Charles VI of France.

==Family==
Francis I was originally engaged to Bonne of Savoy, the daughter of Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, and his wife Mary of Burgundy. She died just before their marriage in 1430, at the age of 15.

Francis I&#x27;s first marriage was to Yolande of Anjou, daughter of Louis II, Duke of Anjou and Yolande of Aragon; they were married in Nantes in August 1431. Francis and Yolande had a son, Renaud, Count of Montfort. His son Renaud died young and his wife Yolande died in 1440.

Francis&#x27; second marriage was to Isabel of Scotland, daughter of James I, King of Scots and Joan Beaufort. She had been intended to marry his father John V, Duke of Brittany, with the marriage contract signed on 19 July 1441 and ratified on 29 September 1441, but he died before the wedding took place. Once in Brittany, Isabella married instead with the widowed eldest son of her groom. Francis and Isabel married at the ChÃ¢teau d&#x27;Auray on 30 October 1442. Francis gifted her the Hours of Isabella Stuart after their wedding.

Francis and Isabel had two daughters:
* Margaret of Brittany (1443â1469, Nantes), married Francis II, Duke of Brittany.
* Marie of Brittany (1444â1506), married John II, Viscount of Rohan and Count of PorhoÃ«t.

==Succession==
Francis I died on 17 July 1450 at the ChÃ¢teau de l&#x27;Hermine, being only 36 years of age. Because he had no surviving male heirs at the time of his death, he was succeeded as Duke of Brittany by his younger brother, Peter II of Brittany.

During his time, the residences of the Dukes of Brittany consisted of: the ChÃ¢teau de l&#x27;Hermine; the ChÃ¢teau de Nantes; the ChÃ¢teau de Clisson; and the ChÃ¢teau de Suscinio.

<doc id="640425" wikidata="Q5871109" url="?curid=640425" title="History of youth work">
<text>The history of youth work goes back to the birth of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, which was the first time that young men left their own homes and cottage industries to migrate to the big towns. The result of this migration was an emergent youth culture in urban areas, which was responded to by the efforts of local people.

==1844â1900==
In 1844 the first organisation whose sole aim was to address the needs of young men was founded. The YMCA was set up by George Williams. Williams was from London and his goal was to create an organisation that catered for the spiritual and emotional needs as well as the physical needs of the young men that he saw around him. The delivery of Williams&#x27; work was mainly through missionaries working on the streets of London though it wasn&#x27;t long before the first hostel was founded.

Work with young women however was seen as less important because young women&#x27;s needs at this time were seen as being centred on homemaking, which were already (supposedly) provided for in the home. This changed in 1878 when youth work pioneer Maude Stanley developed work with young women around the Five Dials area of London. She went on to establish the Girls Club Union.

Later that century in 1883 the Boys&#x27; Brigade was founded by William Alexander Smith. He was a teacher and like Williams in 1844 his aim was to provide for the needs of young men that he worked with. His organisation was based more around the military than the YMCA was, though it was still mainly a Christian organisation.

Still staying within London in 1896 Lily Montagu contacted young Jewish people from Eastern European families in the east end and set up an organisation called Children&#x27;s Synagogue Services. Montagu went on to become a founder member of the &quot;National Organisation of Girls&#x27; Clubs&quot; (now called UK Youth) and was a key figure in the development of Jewish youth work.

==1900â1950==

In 1902, in the US, the Woodcraft Indians was set up by Ernest Thompson Seton. Despite the name, the program was created for non-Indian children. At first the group was for boys only, but later it would also include girls. Seton instructed the children in his town in Connecticut in outdoor &quot;Woodcraft&quot; â knowledge and skills of life in the woods â and based much of the group&#x27;s terminology and structure on the misconceptions about Native Americans that were common in that era. The program spread internationally to become the Woodcraft Movement and many of these programs still exist. Seton&#x27;s Woodcraft scheme also had a strong influence on later youth programs and organizations, particularly, the Scout Movement.

In 1907 Scouting was founded by Robert Baden-Powell following the success of his book &quot;Aids to Scouting&quot;. His inspiration for this organisation was his experience during the Siege of Mafeking in the Second Boer War (1899â1902). Like Smith&#x27;s Boys&#x27; Brigade, the organisation was uniformed, being heavily influenced by the military, though it has changed tremendously as a movement since that time. For the first time youth work in the UK was taken out of the streets of London as Scouting was made into a national (and before long international) organisation.

A year later in 1908, Charles Russell began his work with young men on the streets in deprived areas of Manchester, leading to the foundation of the National association of boys&#x27; clubs movement.

In 1910 the Girl Guides (and later Girl Scouts in the United States) were founded by Baden-Powell with the aid of his sister Agnes. This was because young women were approaching Scout leaders asking if they would be able to join the organisation, and Baden-Powell responded to this but he felt having girls and boys in the same scout troops would be an unnecessary distraction for both groups.

Contemporaneous with the development of Scouting was the creation of the TUXIS movement in Canada. Originally developed through the YMCA and later governed by the Boys&#x27; Work Board, the TUXIS program for boys aged 15 to 17 focused on Christian values, leadership, the outdoors, and camping. The Boys&#x27; Work Board also created the Trail Rangers program for boys aged 12 â 14. A parallel program was established for girls, called the Canadian Girls in Training (CGIT).

Later in the 20th century concerns were raised about the number of young people not in membership of youth organisations. This led to the first (unsuccessful) attempt to register all young people in Britain in 1941.

The next approach to develop was that by arts worker Marie Paneth in 1944. She went out onto the streets of London to address issues such as health, family breakdown and poverty in war-torn parts of the city, using a disused air raid shelter as her base. Her aim was to make &quot;good, independent citizens for a good community&quot;.

During the second world war, leaders were looking for strategies to prevent a World War III â which would probably be fought with nuclear bombs and annihilate humanity. One of the strategies put in place was to set-up youth organisations worldwide and have youth with similar fields of interest organize and participate in youth exchanges. At these events, youth from different countries and cultures would get to know each other, come together around constructive activities and bring back positive experiences to their societies. These youngsters and young adults would eventually become adults in places of responsibilities and in case of a crisis, it was hoped that this civil network would resist war mongering rhetorics, lies and disinformation. Thus, e.g. in 1956, UNESCO&#x27;s IUCN â International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources â since called the World Conservation Union, created a youth section, the IYF â International Youth Federation for the Study and Conservation of Nature â renamed to International Youth Federation for Environmental Studies and Conservation. In 1983, because of growing success, regional branches were created s.a. the European branch YEE=Youth Environment Europe.

==1950â2000==
By 1959 widespread moral panic in the press about teenage delinquency led the British government to look into a national response to catering for the needs of young people. In 1960 a government report known as &quot;The Albemarle Report&quot; was released, which outlined the need for local government agencies to take on responsibility for providing extracurricular activities for young people. Out of this the statutory sector of the youth service was born. For the first time youth centres and fully paid full-time youth workers made an appearance across the whole of Britain.

Five years later the &quot;National Association of Youth Clubs&quot; (now UK Youth) published a report called &quot;The Unattached&quot; about experimental street projects that were taking place up and down the country. It outlined the need for something more than youth centres in certain parts of the country because young people were still being excluded, and it sold tens of thousands of copies.

==2000âpresent==
A further government report in 2001 entitled &quot;Transforming Youth Work&quot; for the first time outlined the statutory responsibility for all local government organisations to provide targeted youth work activities within their region. With targets published in 2003 set on 2001 census information many local authorities were given the push they needed to establish quality services.

<text>John O&#x27;Farrell (born 27 March 1962) is a British author, comedy scriptwriter, and political campaigner. Previously a lead writer for such shows as &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, he is now best known as a comic author for such books such as &quot;The Man Who Forgot His Wife&quot; and &quot;An Utterly Impartial History of Britain&quot;. He is one of a small number of British writers to have achieved best-seller status with both fiction and nonfiction. His books have been translated into around thirty languages and adapted for radio and television.

O&#x27;Farrell co-wrote the musical &quot;Something Rotten!&quot;, which opened on Broadway in April 2015, and co-wrote a Broadway musical of &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; which opened on Broadway in December 2021 and in London&#x27;s West End in May 2023. He wrote the musical &quot;Just for One Day&quot; based on the story of the 1985 benefit concert Live Aid which had its world premiere at The Old Vic in London on 13 February 2024.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Farrell grew up in Maidenhead, Berkshire, the youngest of three children, attending Courthouse Primary School and then Desborough Comprehensive where he wrote comedy for the school magazine and stood as the Labour candidate in the school&#x27;s 1979 mock election. His father was a book dealer from Galway, Ireland, whilst his mother was active in Oxfam and Amnesty International. He attended classes at the Redroofs Theatre School and played Christopher Robin in the West End at the age of ten, before appearing in the horror film &quot;From Beyond the Grave&quot; with Diana Dors and Donald Pleasence, and the BBC Children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Jumbo Spencer&quot; in 1976. O&#x27;Farrell went on to study English and drama at Exeter University.

==Scriptwriting career==
O&#x27;Farrell moved to London in 1985, winning a talent competition at Jongleurs in Battersea, but gave up stand up-comedy in favour of comedy writing. After attending the open meetings for Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Week Ending&quot; he formed a writing partnership with Mark Burton and they soon became lead writers on the show. The duo won the BBC Radio Comedy Writers Bursary, and wrote for a number of radio comedy series, including &quot;Little Blighty on the Down&quot;, &quot;McKay the New&quot; and, with Pete Sinclair, &quot;A Look Back at the Nineties&quot; and &quot;Look Back at the Future&quot;, in which O&#x27;Farrell also performed. The latter series won a British Comedy Award, a Gold Sony Radio Academy Award and a Premios Ondas.

Burton and O&#x27;Farrell were commissioned for &quot;Spitting Image&quot; in 1988 and the following year became two of the lead writers for the show, where they remained for 10 series. O&#x27;Farrell is credited with the idea of making John Major permanently grey. They also wrote for &quot;Clive Anderson Talks Back&quot;, Nick Hancock on &quot;Room 101&quot;, &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot;, and co-wrote some of the &quot;Heads to Heads&quot; for &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;. In 1993, they left &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and became the first writers credited for the scripted parts of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. Again for Hat Trick Productions, they wrote the BBC1 sitcom &quot;The Peter Principle&quot; starring Jim Broadbent. They also contributed to the screenplay of the Aardman film &quot;Chicken Run&quot;. It was announced in April 2018 that O&#x27;Farrell was co-writing a sequel to &quot;Chicken Run&quot;.

OâFarrell co-wrote the book for the original stage musical &quot;Something Rotten!&quot;, which opened on Broadway in April 2015, and for which he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical with Karey Kirkpatrick as well as a Drama Desk Award and an Outer Circle Critics Award. The show ran for nearly two years on Broadway before going on tour across the United States. It was announced in August 2018 that the same team had been commissioned to write a stage musical of the film &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; for Broadway. The stage musical, also titled &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; premiered at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle, Washington and opened on Broadway at the Stephen Sondheim Theater in December 2021. It opened at Manchester Opera House in September 2022 and transferred to the Shaftesbury Theatre, in London&#x27;s West End in May 2023. On 2 October 2023, it was announced that John O&#x27;Farrell had written a musical based around &quot;Live Aid&quot; which was to have its world premiere at The Old Vic in London on 13 February 2024, following previews from 26 January, running until 30 March. The production was directed by Luke Shepard and produced with Bob Geldof and Band Aid&#x27;s permission. Ten per cent of ticket prices were donated to the Band Aid Trust for their continuing work in Africa.

==Literary career==
In 1998, O&#x27;Farrell published &quot;Things Can Only Get Better: Eighteen Miserable Years in the Life of a Labour Supporter&quot;. The book became a number-one best-seller, and was nominated for the George Orwell Award and the Channel 4 Political Awards. The popularity of the book led O&#x27;Farrell to be invited to address the 1999 Labour Party conference. The memoir was adapted for BBC Radio 4 starring Jack Dee and Doon Mackichan. In September 2010, it was listed by &quot;The Economist&quot; as Britain&#x27;s third best-selling political memoir since 1998, after books by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.

In 1999, O&#x27;Farrell began a weekly satirical column in &quot;The Independent&quot;, soon switching to &quot;The Guardian&quot; where he remained until 2005. Three collections of his columns have been published; &quot;Global Village Idiot&quot;, &quot;I Blame the Scapegoats&quot; and &quot;I Have A Bream&quot;.

In 2000, O&#x27;Farrell published his first novel, &quot;The Best a Man Can Get&quot;, which was the best-selling debut novel in 2002 and eventually sold half a million copies. It was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 starring Mark Heap and Tamsin Greig. The novel was later optioned by Paramount Pictures. Two further novels followed, &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; and &quot;May Contain Nuts&quot;, the latter of which was nominated for the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize and adapted for ITV by his former co-writer Mark Burton and starred Shirley Henderson and Darren Boyd.

In 2007, he returned to non-fiction with the publication of &quot;An Utterly Impartial History of Britain, or 2000 Years of Upper Class Idiots in Charge&quot; which was BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Week&quot; and went on to sell over 250,000 copies. This was followed in October 2009 by &quot;An Utterly Exasperated History of Modern Britain, or Sixty Years of Making the Same Stupid Mistakes as Always&quot;.

His fourth novel, &quot;The Man Who Forgot His Wife&quot;, was published in March 2012 and was nominated for the Bollinger Wodehouse Award for comic fiction.

O&#x27;Farrell has contributed short stories and non-fiction pieces to a number of charity collections: Nick Hornby&#x27;s &quot;Speaking with the Angel&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Mums&quot;, &quot;Dads&quot; and &quot;Being British&quot; edited by Gordon Brown. He also contributed a story for &quot;The Anniversary&quot;, a collection of short stories published as part of the Quick Reads Initiative.

In November 2015, he published his fifth novel &quot;There&#x27;s Only Two David Beckhams&quot; described as a football fantasy set at the Qatar World Cup in 2022, which earned him his third nomination for the Wodehouse Award.

In September 2017, he published &quot;Things Can Only Get Worse? Twenty Confusing Years in the Life of a Labour Supporter&quot; â the sequel to his first political memoir, picking up where the original left off, from the New Labour landslide of 1997 following the journey over two decades up to Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and Theresa May&#x27;s snap election of 2017. The memoir was shortlisted for the 2017 Parliamentary Book Awards for &quot;Best book by a non-Parliamentarian&quot; and was adapted for serialisation on BBC Radio 4. In March 2024, he published his sixth novel &quot;Family Politics&quot;, described by Alistair Campbell as &quot;the funniest book about politics I have ever read&quot;.

O&#x27;Farrell has sold over 1 million books in the UK, and his novels have been translated into over 30 languages, including a Japanese manga edition of &quot;The Best a Man Can Get&quot;.

==Broadcasting==
O&#x27;Farrell has appeared on such programmes as &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;, &quot;Question Time&quot;, &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;. and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, the only guest previously to have worked on the show&#x27;s production team. He has written and presented a number of TV and radio documentaries such as &quot;Losing My Maidenhead&quot; and &quot;Paranoid Parenting&quot; for BBC1, and &quot;Dreaming of Toad Hall&quot;, &quot;Turn Over Your Papers Now&quot; and &quot;The Grand Masquerade&quot; for Radio 4. After O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s radio programme &quot;The Grand Masquerade&quot; on the Kit Williams 1979 treasure hunt book, the golden hare resurfaced, 20 years after it had disappeared.

In 2013, he was chosen by BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; as the man to put the feminist case against the launch of a new Men&#x27;s Rights Party. He appeared in &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; in 2016 and 2019 and captained the Exeter Alumni team on &quot;University Challenge&quot; in December 2012. In January 2025 he was a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;. Other TV appearances and radio broadcasts, include &quot;Crime Team&quot;, &quot;What the Papers Say&quot;, &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, &quot;Heresy&quot;, &quot;Quote Unquote&quot;, &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;, &quot;The Daily Politics&quot;, &quot;What the Dickens&quot;, &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ve Been Here Before&quot;, &quot;Clive Anderson&#x27;s Chat Room&quot; and &quot;Loose Ends&quot;. In January 2020, he teamed up with comedian Angela Barnes to create a new podcast called &#x27;We Are History&#x27; which looks at funny, quirky or interesting stories from British and world history.

==Internet==
In September 2006, O&#x27;Farrell launched Britain&#x27;s first daily news satire website, NewsBiscuit, to create a new outlet for British comedy on the internet. The site also develops new writing using a submissions board where readers can rate each other&#x27;s material and suggest rewrites or edits. A collection of some of the best stories was published in 2008 as &quot;Isle of Wight to Get Ceefax&quot;. A number of the writers have gone on to write for BBC Radio or publish books after developing their material on NewsBiscuit. In June 2021, he announced on Twitter that he was giving the site to the team of editors who had effectively been running the site for the previous few years.

==Politics==
For many years O&#x27;Farrell has been a member of the Labour Party. He stood as a paper candidate for Labour in his home town of Maidenhead (the constituency of now former Prime Minister Theresa May) during the 2001 general election, which was the subject of the BBC documentary &quot;Losing My Maidenhead&quot;. During the 2005 general election his comic emails to Labour members raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for the party&#x27;s election campaign. In April 2007, he conducted the first ever interview of a serving Prime Minister on the internet when he spoke to Tony Blair. He has written jokes for Prime Ministers Blair and Gordon Brown, as well as other senior Labour figures.

He successfully campaigned for a new state secondary school to be opened in Lambeth, the Lambeth Academy, and became the chair of governors from its opening in 2004 until 2012. He also sat on the board of the United Learning Trust, and is an outspoken supporter of state education. In September 2012, he became Writer in Residence at Burlington Danes Academy in northwest London through the literacy charity First Story.

In February 2013, O&#x27;Farrell was selected as the Labour candidate in the Eastleigh by-election which was caused by the resignation of Chris Huhne. He became the target of a campaign by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and other Conservative-supporting newspapers who used extracts or jokes from O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s books to claim that he was unsuitable for office, as David Cameron attempted to embarrass the Labour leader Ed Miliband by reading out extracts of &quot;Things Can Only Get Better&quot; during Prime Minister&#x27;s Question Time. O&#x27;Farrell slightly increased Labour&#x27;s share of the vote, but finished fourth. He announced that he was not intending to stand for Parliament in 2015. On the death of Margaret Thatcher, O&#x27;Farrell led calls for Labour supporters to put their hatred behind them, and to donate to those who suffered under her rule. His political and education campaigns are chronicled in his memoir &quot;Things Can Only Get Worse&quot;.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Farrell is married with two grown-up children, who both attended Lambeth Academy. He and his family live in Clapham in South London and holiday in West Cork. He holds British and Irish passports. O&#x27;Farrell met his wife Jackie when she worked in BBC Radio Comedy. She was the production assistant who had to sit on stage beside Humphrey Lyttelton during &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, and O&#x27;Farrell joked &quot;I married the lovely Samantha!&quot; He does much of his writing at the London Library.

He supports Fulham F.C. and revealed in the club fanzine that the characters in each of his novels are named after players from a particular Fulham team.

<text>Lemar Obika (born 4 April 1978), known mononymously as Lemar, is an English singer, songwriter and record producer. Initially rising to fame after finishing third on the first series of British talent show &quot;Fame Academy&quot;, he was later signed to Sony BMG, where he has gone on to release five studio albums, three of which are certified platinum or double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

Lemar&#x27;s double-platinum debut album &quot;Dedicated&quot; was released in November 2003 and contained the successful singles &quot;Dance (With U)&quot;, &quot;50/50&quot; and &quot;Another Day&quot;, all of which charted in the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. His second effort, &quot;Time to Grow&quot;, saw similar success, again achieving double platinum certification and spawning his most successful single, &quot;If There&#x27;s Any Justice&quot;, which peaked at number 3 and spent four months in the UK Singles Chart. Lemar has seen considerable chart success in the UK and Ireland, releasing ten top 20 singles, seven of which peaked in the top 10, and has sold over two million albums.

==Early life==
Lemar Obika was born in Tottenham, North London, England to Nigerian parents. He grew up listening to R&amp;B and soul music. He used to sing at home with his siblings, pretending to be Michael Jackson and the Jacksons.
He was 17 when he had his first concert at the Junior Jam at &#x27;The Temple&#x27; in Tottenham supporting American singer Usher. At the time, he was designing a website to sell logos for the Ericsson PH337 phone. Later on, he gave up an opportunity to study pharmacy at Cardiff University to pursue a musical career. Lemar had some success supporting various artists such as American girl groups Destiny&#x27;s Child and Total on their UK club tours and after some years, managed to secure a recording contract with BMG. Following this, he released his debut single &quot;Got Me Saying Ooh&quot;. His record deal with BMG fell through in less than a year due to restructuring at the record label. He had to eventually take a job working as an accounts manager at NatWest in Enfield, North London. At age 24, his mother died of cancer and he found listening to Eric Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; brought &quot;clarity&quot; and aims to &quot;write songs as moving as this&quot;.

==Career==

Lemar was most notably brought to public attention on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Fame Academy&quot; in 2002, a combination of a talent quest and reality television show. He made the finals of the show winning plaudits for his version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; by Al Green and singing a duet with Lionel Richie on &quot;Easy&quot;. While he ended up finishing third in the show, which was won by David Sneddon, he caught the eye of fellow British soul singer Beverley Knight, who invited him to sing a duet with her during her concert at the Hammersmith Apollo.

Sony Music was so impressed with his potential that they signed him to a five-year record deal worth Â£1 million. He was also the contestant from &quot;Fame Academy&quot; chosen to represent the UK in Eurobest, coming fifth (the eventual winner being Chenoa from Spain).

Lemar&#x27;s second single &quot;Dance (with U)&quot; reached number two on the UK Singles Chart in early 2003. His first album &quot;Dedicated&quot; was released late in 2003 with additional singles &quot;50/50&quot; and &quot;Another Day&quot; also achieving chart success in the UK. Following the success of the album, he commenced his first headlining tour of the UK. After completing his UK tour, Lemar was the opening act for Justin Timberlake&#x27;s UK tour dates. Thus, he is considered the &quot;most successful graduate.

Two more singles were released from the album, &quot;Someone Should Tell You&quot; and &quot;Tick Tock&quot;. At the Brit Awards in 2007, Lemar was hoping to arrive in a makeshift limo, with James May from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; as the driver.

On his site The Re-View, Nick Bassett praises &quot;Invincible&quot; for its &quot;narrative journey which showcases Lemarâs songwriting talents as well as his impressive vocal.&quot;

Lemar returned again in 2015 with his single &quot;The Letter&quot;, which got its first airplay on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s breakfast show with Chris Evans. &quot;The Letter&quot; was also the title of his latest album.

<text>The NÄ«lgiris district is one of the 38 districts in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Nilgiri () is the name given to a range of mountains spread across the borders among the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The Nilgiri Hills are part of a larger mountain chain known as the Western Ghats. Their highest point is the mountain of Doddabetta, height 2,637 m. The district is contained mainly within the Nilgiri Mountains range. The administrative headquarters is located at Ooty (Ootacamund or Udhagamandalam). The district is bounded by Coimbatore to the south, Erode to the east, and Chamarajnagar district of Karnataka and Wayanad district of Kerala to the north. As it is located at the junction of three states, namely, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka, significant Malayali and Kannadiga populations reside in the district. Nilgiris district is known for natural mines of Gold, which is also seen in the other parts of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve extended in the neighbouring states of Karnataka and Kerala too.

Nilgiris district ranked first in a comprehensive Economic Environment index ranking districts in Tamil Nadu (except Chennai district) prepared by the Institute for Financial Management and Research in August 2009. Tea and coffee plantations have been important to its economy. As of 2011, the Nilgiris district had a population of 735,394, with a sex-ratio of 1,042 females for every 1,000 males. All types of single use plastics are banned in Nilgiris district: it is the first plastic free district in Tamil Nadu.

==History==
The history of peoples settled in the Nilgiri hills has been recorded for several centuries. The Blue Mountains were likely named for the widespread blue Strobilanthes flower or the smoky haze enveloping the area.

This area was long occupied by the indigenous tribal peoples of the Toda, Kota, Kurumba, Irula and Badagas. The Badagas were also indigenous to the district but were never a tribal group. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups PVTGs, the dominant land owners of the tribal district. The lower Wayanad plateau in the west of the district had a different tribal population namely Kattunaika and Paniya. The Todas and Kota, who are similar in culture, language and genetic ancestry, were settled across the fringes of the Nilgiri plateau, as sentries to the Central district. They were the ancient agriculturists in the district, cultivating traditional crops such as samai, vathm, ragi. Under British influence they cultivated English vegetables and later moved on to tea.

Unlike elsewhere in the country, no historical evidence is found of a state on the Nilgiris or that it was part of any ancient kingdom or empire. It seems always to have been a tribal land. The Toda had small hamlets (&quot;mund&quot;) across most of the plateau. The Kota lived in seven dispersed villages (&quot;kokal&quot;). The Toda had only a few hamlets on the lower Wynaad plateau and in the nearby Biligiriranga hills.

These Indigenous tribes of Nilgiris speak some form of dravidian language. 

Since the turn of the 21st century, the Badaga have numbered about 135,000 (18% of the district population), the Toda are barely 1,500 and the Kota just over 2,000.

Beginning in 1819, the British colonial administration developed the hills rapidly and peaceably, for use as coffee and tea plantations, and summer residences. The 40 mud-forts in the area had been abandoned. During the British raj, Ooty (the popular name for Ootacamund) served as the summer capital of the Madras Presidency from 1870 onwards. District Gazetteers published by the government (1880, 1908, 1995) were reliable reports on the district, its economy, demography and culture. They with the support of political parties inimical to the natives of Nilgiris have been superseded by the &quot;Encyclopaedia of the Nilgiri Hills&quot; (2012) authored by California-based researcher Paul Hockings, who has been studying the Badagas for over sixty years.
According to a 1996 bibliography of publications of this district, it is probably the most heavily studied rural area anywhere in India, with close to 7,000 items in that list. It has been the subject of more than 120 doctoral and master&#x27;s theses in the natural and human sciences. Indian and foreign scholars wrote these works, and only recently have local people published work about it.

More than a dozen languages are spoken in the Nilgiris, but the indigenous people did not write or read them. After 1847 German and Swiss missionaries opened schools for boys and girls in some Badaga villages, teaching them literacy. Ten Dravidian languages are found only here, and they have been studied in great detail for decades by professional linguists. Local place names are derived mainly from the dominant Badaga language, for example, Doddabetta, Coonoor, Kotagiri, Gudaluru, Kunda, etc. Ootacamund is of Toda origin, and Udagamandalam is a very recent Tamil-language version of this place.

Before British-owned tea and coffee plantations were developed, the dominant landholders were the Badaga. A great deal of linguistic and other cultural evidenceâbased on unauthentic interpretation of ballads and stories collected from unverifiable individualsâindicates erroneously with a malicious intent that the Badaga non scheduled tribes have lived in nilgiris thousands and thousands of years ago. Supposedly unnamed Badaga elders have regularly recounted these baseless facts as oral history and cannot be relied upon. Though their language is very close to Kannada, it is a mixture of almost all Dravidian languages and yet unique. The migration theory is now totally rejected by educated Badagas, as admittedly the land holdings of the district majorly indicates the Badagas as owners in almost all Taluks of the district. This land is the major resource amongst the Badagas, which even today most Badagas are ignorant about. The Badagas did not find any representation in independent India&#x27;s Constituent Assembly; to deprive the unlettered Badaga of their land it was intentionally left out of the tribal list post independence. The result of this socio-economic engineering seems to be bearing fruit for the perpetrators of such engineering.

The district has been intentionally underdeveloped as it is bereft of quality healthcare facilities, universities, environment-friendly industries, affordable quality higher education and basic infrastructure. This underdevelopment has ensured the Badagas need to go outside the district to survive. Certain vested interest have invested in researchers to bring about half-truths about the Badagas. Sadly, these half-truths are being relied on by the regime to deny the Badagas their rightful livelihood. During the early 17th century, the first European is recorded as entering the Nilgiri Hills, an Italian priest/explorer named Fenicio. He interviewed people who identified as Toda and Badega, the latter occupying three villages at that time. The British in India mostly ignored the Ghats for two centuries. Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, conducted a short military operation in the Wynaad in 1800.

During 1804â1818 several East India Company personnel briefly visited parts of the district. John Sullivan, then the collector of Coimbatore, just south of the Nilgiris, sent two surveyors (W. Keys and C. McMahon) to make a comprehensive study of the hills. They reached the site of Ootacamund, but failed to see the complete plateau. In 1812 they were the first British to make a cursory survey of the Nilgiri plateau and produce a map. A more detailed exploration was done in the 1818 survey by J.C. Whish, N.W. Kindersley and Mohammed Rifash Obaidullah for the Madras Civil Service, who reported back that they had discovered &quot;the existence of a tableland possessing a European climate.&quot;

Collector Sullivan became the first European resident the next year, when he built a seasonal residence on the plateau. He reported to the Madras Government on the mildness of the climate. Europeans soon started settling here or using the plateau as a summer resort and homes for retirees. In 1870 the practice began of key government personnel moving to the hills to conduct business during summer months in this more temperate climate. By the end of the 19th century, the hills were completely accessible, as several Ghat roads and the railway line had been constructed.

In the later 19th century, when the British Straits Settlement shipped Chinese convicts to be jailed in India, some of these men were settled on the Nilgiri plateau near Naduvattam. They married Tamil Paraiyan women and had children with them. One Chinese gardener was critical to the district&#x27;s future, for he worked with Margaret B. L. Cockburn in Aruvenu, near Kotagiri, to develop Allport&#x27;s, the first Nilgiri tea plantation, which started operations in 1863. Her father, Montague D. Cockburn, had opened the first coffee plantation there soon after 1830.

==Geography and climate==

The district has an area of 2,552.50Â km2. The district is basically hilly, lying at an elevation of 1,000 to 2,600 metres above MSL, and divided between the Nilgiri plateau and the lower, smaller Wayanad plateau. The district lies at the juncture of the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats. Its latitudinal and longitudinal location is 130Â km (Latitude: 11Â°12 N to 11Â°37 N) by 185Â km (Longitude : 76Â°30 E to 76Â°55 E). The district is bounded by Coimbatore and Palakkad to the south, Erode to the east, Chamarajnagar district of Karnataka and Wayanad district of Kerala to the north, and Malappuram district of Kerala to the west. In this district the topography is rolling, with steep escarpments; about 60% of the cultivable land is slopes ranging from 16Â° to 35Â°. The rolling hills of the Downs look quite similar to the Downs in southern England, and were formerly used for such activities as hunting and picnicking.

The elevation of the Nilgiris results in a much cooler and wetter climate than the surrounding plains, so the area is popular as a comfortable retreat and is good for tea cultivation. During summer the temperature reaches a maximum of and a minimum of . During winter the temperature maximum is and the minimum . The district regularly receives rain during both the Southwest Monsoon and the Northeast Monsoon. The entire Gudalur and Pandalur, Kundah Taluks and parts of Udhagamandalam Taluk get rain from the Southwest Monsoon, while part of Udhagamandalam Taluk and the entire Coonoor and Kotagiri Taluks get rains of the Northeast Monsoon. There are 16 rainfall-registering stations in the district, and the average annual rainfall of the district is 1,920.80Â mm.

The principal town of the area is Ootacamund, also known as Ooty or Udhagamandalam, the district headquarters. It has several buildings designed in the British style, particularly the churches, many of which were designed by architect Robert F. Chisholm. A road junction became known as Charing Cross (after famous intersections in London and Lahore). The other main towns in the Nilgiris are Coonoor, Kotagiri, Gudalur. Ooty too has an annual summer flower show.

==District administration==
The Nilgiris district has been headed by a government-appointed Collector since 1868. The first was James W. Breeks, who was called Commissioner. Since then there have been more than 100 men and women who have held the post. They were responsible for overseeing the various Departments active within the district.

The district comprises three revenue divisions and six taluks. The revenue divisions are: Uhagamandalam, Coonoor and Gudalur. The taluks are: Udhagamandalam (Ooty/Ootacamund), Kundah, Coonoor, Kotagiri, Gudalur and Pandalur.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census, the Nilgiris district had a population of 735,394 with a sex-ratio of 1,042 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929 females. 59.24% of the population lived in urban areas. A total of 66,799 people were under the age of six, 33,648 males and 33,151 females. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 32.08% and 4.46% of the population, respectively. The average literacy of the district was 77.46%, as compared to the national average of 72.99%. The district had a total of 197,653 households. There were a total of 349,974 workers, comprising 14,592 cultivators, 71,738 agricultural labourers, 3,019 in household industries, 229,575 other workers, 31,050 marginal workers, 1,053 marginal cultivators, 7,362 marginal agricultural labourers, 876 marginal workers in household industries and 21,759 other marginal workers.
Anthropologists, who have worked intensively in this district for the past 140 years, recognise 15 tribes living here. Their origins are uncertain as there were no written records about them. The best-known of these are the Toda and Kota, whose related cultures are based on pastoral management of the buffalo, with its dairy products being the basis of their diets. They have developed highly refined red, black and white embroidered shawls, and silver jewellery, which are GI-registered and much sought after. The district is also home to the Kurumba, Irula, Paniya and Kattunayakan or Nayaka.

The entire Nilgiris plateau and all the hilly regions above the plains (altitude higher than 500m MSL) across the Western and Eastern Ghats and the Mysore plateau fell under the Kannada speaking area as per the linguistic survey and history by Colonel Mark Wilks.

===Religion===
As per the Census of 2011, the Nilgiris district had 76.61% Hindus, 11.51% Christians and 10.67% Muslims. Many of the Muslims and Christians have migrated to the Nilgiris from adjoining Wayanad, Malappuram and Palakkad districts in Kerala state. Hindus are more dominant in rural areas.

===Languages===

At the time of the 2011 census, 48.55% of the population spoke Tamil, 16.96% Malayalam, 16.65% Badaga, 6.66% Kannada, 3.63% Telugu, 1.59% Urdu, 1.07% Irula and 0.95% Pania as their first language.

Nilgiris is arguably the most multi lingual and multicultural district in Tamil Nadu State. Tamil is the principal and most spoken language in the Nilgiris district followed by Malayalam, Badaga, Kannada, Telugu and Urdu languages. Other smaller languages include Irula, Paniya, Kurumba, Toda and Kota are also spoken here.

==Politics==

==Basic infrastructure==

===Transport===
The NagapattinamâGudalur National Highway passes through this district. The Nilgiri Ghat Roads link Nilgiris with nearby cities in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. All the taluks are connected with major roads. Ooty bus stand serves as the central bus stand for the district.Several crucial Ghat roads were cut in the 19th century. The village roads are maintained by the Panchayat Union.

The Nilgiri Mountain Railway from Mettupalayam to Udhagamandalam , is a great tourist attraction. It was filmed in &quot;A Passage to India,&quot; representing the railway to the caves. It is a Swiss-designed rack railway. The railway is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It serves certain areas of the district, including Coonoor, Wellington, Aruvankadu, Ketti, Lovedale and Ooty. There is no seaport or airport in the district; the nearest airport is Coimbatore.

===Health infrastructure===
There are one district headquarters government hospital, five taluk hospitals, 38 primary health centres, 194 health sub-centres, and five plague circles in the district.

==Agriculture==

The Nilgiris district is basically a horticulture district. Its economy is based on commodity crops of tea, coffee, and spices, followed in importance by potato, cabbage, carrot, and fruit. The main cultivation is plantation crops such as tea and coffee, but with some cardamom, pepper and rubber too. Tea grows at elevations of 1,000 to over 2,500 metres.

The area also produces eucalyptus oil and temperate-zone vegetables. Potato and other vegetables are raised throughout Udhagamandalam and Coonoor Taluks. Paddy (rice), ginger, pepper and rubber are grown in Gudalur and Pandalur Taluks. Paddy is also grown in the Thengumarahada area in Kotagiri Taluk. Besides these crops, millet, wheat, fruit and vegetables, etc., are also cultivated throughout the district. There are no irrigation schemes here. The crops are mainly rain-fed. Check dams have been constructed wherever possible to exploit natural springs.

==Ecoregions==

Two ecoregions cover portions of the Nilgiris. The South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests lie between 250 and 1000 metres&#x27; elevation. These forests extend south along the Western Ghats range to the southern tip of India, and are dominated by a diverse assemblage of trees, many of them deciduous during the winter and spring dry season. These forests are home to the largest herd of Asian elephants in India, who range from the Nilgiris across towards the Eastern Ghats. The Nilgiris and the Southwestern Ghats are also one of the most important tiger habitats left in India.

The South Western Ghats montane rain forests ecoregion covers the portion of the range above 1000 metres&#x27; elevation. These evergreen rain forests are extremely diverse. Above 1500 metres&#x27; elevation, the evergreen forests begin to give way to stunted forests, locally called &quot;sholas&quot;, which are interspersed with open grassland The high grasslands are home to the endangered Nilgiri tahr, which resembles a stocky goat with curved horns. The Nilgiri tahrs are found only in the montane grasslands of the Southwestern Ghats, and number barely 2000 individuals.
Three national parks protect portions of the Nilgiris. Mudumalai National Park lies in the northern part of the range where Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu meet, and covers an area of 321Â km2. Mukurthi National Park lies in the southwest of the range, in Kerala, and covers an area of 78.5Â km2, which includes intact &quot;shola&quot;-grassland mosaic, a habitat for the Nilgiri tahr. Silent Valley National Park is just to the south and contiguous with these two parks, and covers an area of 89.52Â km2. Outside these parks much of the native forest has been cleared for grazing cattle, or has been encroached upon or replaced by plantations of tea, eucalyptus, cinchona and acacia. The entire range, together with portions of the Western Ghats to the northwest and southwest, was included in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in 1986, India&#x27;s first biosphere reserve. In January 2010, the Nilgiri Declaration set out a wide range environmental and sustainable development goals to be reached by 2015.

The region has also given its name to a number of bird species, including the Nilgiri pipit, Nilgiri woodpigeon and Nilgiri blackbird.

== Government labs and research institutions ==
The Nilgiris is the headquarters of various government and semi-private organizations engaged in research into horticulture, forestry, botanical sciences and physics. Listed below are a few of the most important ones:

* Horticultural Research Station, Ooty
* Central Soil and Water Conservation Research and Training Institute, Theetukal

==Tourism==

Tourism is an important source of revenue for the Nilgiris. The district is home to several hill stations which are visited by tourists during summer. These include Ooty (Udhgamandalam) (district headquarters), Coonoor, Kotagiri. The Nilgiri Mountain Train, locally known as the Toy Train, attracts tourists as the journey has extensive views of the hills and forests.Pazhassi&#x27;s Cave, Wentworth Estate, Cherambadi, Mudumalai National Park is commonly visited by wildlife enthusiasts, campers and backpackers. The annual flower show, organised by the Government of Tamil Nadu at the Botanical Garden in Ooty, is an annual event, known for its display of roses. Nilgiris is known for its eucalyptus oil and tea, and also produces bauxite. Some tourists are attracted to study the lifestyles of the various tribes living here or to visit the tea and vegetable plantations. Other tourist destinations in the district are Pykara Waterfalls and the Ooty Lake, Avalanche and Doddabetta peak.

<doc id="640448" wikidata="Q1088489" url="?curid=640448" title="Sebastiane">
<text>Sebastiane is a 1976 Latin-language British historical film directed by Derek Jarman and Paul Humfress and written by Jarman, Humfress and James Whaley. It portrays the events of the life of Saint Sebastian, including his iconic martyrdom by arrows. The film, which was aimed at a gay audience, was controversial for the homoeroticism portrayed between the soldiers and for having dialogue entirely in Latin.

==Plot==
In the third century AD, Sebastian is a member of the Emperor Diocletian&#x27;s personal guard. When he tries to intervene to stop one of the Emperor&#x27;s catamites from being strangled by one of his bodyguards, Sebastian is exiled to a remote coastal garrison and reduced in rank to private. Sebastian is an early Christian and sublimates his desire for his male companions into the worship of his deity and pacifism. Both incense Severus, the commanding officer of the garrison, who becomes increasingly obsessed with Sebastian, tries to assault him, and ultimately presides over his summary execution for refusing to take up arms in defence of the Roman Empire. Justin, one of his comrades in arms, is also in love with Sebastian, albeit necessarily unrequited, but he forms a friendship with the stubborn celibate pacifist. Adrian and Anthony, two of Sebastian&#x27;s fellow soldiers, are gay and obviously in love with one another.

==Cast==

* Barney James as Severus
* Neil Kennedy as Maximus
* Leonardo Treviglio as Sebastian
* Richard Warwick as Justin
* Donald Dunham as Claudius
* Daevid Finbar as Julian
* Ken Hicks as Adrian
* Lindsay Kemp as Dancer
* Steffano Massari as Marius
* Janusz Romanov as Anthony
* Gerald Incandela as Leopard Boy
* Robert Medley as Emperor Diocletian
The emperor&#x27;s guests included such notables as Peter Hinwood, Nell Campbell, and Patricia Quinn (all of &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; fame), Jordan, Philip Sayer, Charlotte Barnes, Nicholas de Jongh, Duggie Fields, Christopher Hobbs, Andrew Logan, and Johnny Rozsa.

==Reception==
Margaret Walters, author of &quot;The Nude Male&quot;, commented that &quot;Sebastiane&quot;, &quot;where male nudes in various stages of ecstasy positively littered the screen&quot;, was &quot;successfully aimed at a very specialized homosexual audience.&quot;

==Home media==

The film was released on DVD in the UK and the U.S. A Blu-ray disc was released in the U.S. on August 7, 2012.

<doc id="640455" wikidata="Q545140" url="?curid=640455" title="Peter II, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Peter II (in Breton PÃªr II, in French Pierre II) (1418â1457), was Duke of Brittany, Count of Montfort and titular earl of Richmond, from 1450 to his death. He was son of Duke John VI and Joan of France, and a younger brother of Francis I.

==Biography==

While he was Count of Guingamp, he fought against the English in Normandy in 1449 and in 1450 with his brother, Francis I, Duke of Brittany, and his uncle the Constable de Richemont. They took several cities, including Coutances, Saint-LÃ´ and Ferns. Upon the death of his brother in 1450, Peter became Duke. Since Francis did not have a son, according to the provisions of the first Treaty of Guerande (1365) that did not allow the succession of girls, he appointed Peter in preference to his own daughters, Margaret and Marie, to succeed him. Peter II then pursued the murderers of his other brother, Gilles.

By 1455, Peter II and his wife, Frances d&#x27;Amboise, had failed to produce offspring. Given the health problems of Peter II, this raised the question of succession. To prevent the throne of Brittany from falling into foreign hands, the Duke decided to marry his niece, Margaret, the eldest daughter of his deceased brother Francis, to his cousin, Francis, Count of Ãtampes. To seal the marriage, the Duke summoned the Estates of Brittany, a sovereign court, at Vannes to meet on November 13, 1455, in the upper room of la Cohue. The court, composed of the main Breton lords bishops, abbots and representatives of cities approved the marriage.

The wedding started on November 16 with a grand mass in Saint Peter&#x27;s cathedral in Vannes, presided over by the Bishop of Nantes, Guillaume de Malestroit. Further celebrations subsequently took place including banquets, dances and jousts.

The relatively short reign of the Duke did not make a mark on history. His contemporaries described Peter II as simple, well advised by his wife, but little suited to the ducal function, heavy mind as body, prone to mood swings. He participated in the Battle of Castillon in 1453.

While he was still only Count of Guingamp, he had a tomb carved from himself in the Notre-Dame de Nantes which was lost during the French Revolution. It is said that, in 1803, when the church was being destroyed, the engineer Pierre Fournier opened the tomb but found only a mannequin. It is unknown whether the Duke was actually buried in the tomb.

==Family==

In June 1442 he married FranÃ§oise d&#x27;Amboise (1427â1485), daughter of Louis d&#x27;Amboise, Viscount of Thouars and Prince of Talmond, FranÃ§oise was later beatified by the Catholic Church. The marriage never produced any children.

==Succession==
Peter II died in 1457 with no known issue. He was succeeded by his uncle Arthur.

<doc id="640458" wikidata="Q454053" url="?curid=640458" title="Arthur III, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Arthur III (), more commonly known as Arthur de Richemont (24 August 139326 December 1458), was briefly Duke of Brittany from 1457 until his death. He is noted primarily, however, for his role as a leading military commander during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Although Richemont briefly sided with the English once, he otherwise remained firmly committed to the House of Valois. He fought alongside Joan of Arc, and was appointed Constable of France. His military and administrative reforms in the French state were an important factor in assuring the final defeat of the English in the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

The name Richemont reflects the fact that he inherited the English title of Earl of Richmond, which was held by previous dukes of Brittany, but his tenure was never recognized by the English crown. At the very end of his life he became Duke of Brittany and Count of Montfort after inheriting those titles upon the death of his nephew Peter II. Richemont had no legitimate issue and was succeeded in the duchy by his other nephew, Francis II.

==Life==
Arthur was a younger son of Duke John IV and his third wife Joanna of Navarre, and so a member of the Ducal House of Montfort. Arthur was born at the ChÃ¢teau de Suscinio. After the death of his father, his mother remarried Henry IV of England and became Queen (Dowager) of England.

Just a year before his own death, Arthur succeeded his nephew Peter II as Duke. Arthur was also titular Earl of Richmond; the earldom had often been granted to the Dukes of Brittany, but after the death of Arthur&#x27;s father, the English refused to recognize his heirs as earls. Nevertheless, they continued to style themselves &quot;Count of Richmond&quot;, while the English title was given to John Plantagenet, Duke of Bedford (1389â1435) in 1414.

Arthur was an important figure at the French court during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, even before becoming Duke of Brittany.

Arthur sided with the Armagnac faction against the Burgundians during their civil conflict in France which lasted from 1410 to 1414. He then entered the service of the Dauphin Louis, Duke of Guyenne, whose intimate friend he became and whose widow he later married. He profited by his position at court to obtain the lieutenancy of the Bastille, the governorship of the duchy of Nemours, and the confiscated territories of Jean LarchevÃªque, &quot;seigneur&quot; of Parthenay. He fought at the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415, where he was wounded and captured. His mother Queen Dowager Joan unsuccessfully tried to have him released, only to worsen her relationship with her stepson Henry V of England. He was released by the English in 1420 and helped persuade his brother, Duke John, to sign the Treaty of Troyes. In 1422, the English created him Duke of Touraine. However, as the English refused to give him a high command he subsequently returned to the allegiance of the Dauphin in 1424, and was made Constable of France with support from Yolande of Aragon in 1425.
Arthur now persuaded his brother, John V, Duke of Brittany, to conclude the treaty of Saumur with Charles VII of France (7 October 1425). But though he saw clearly enough the measures necessary for success, he lacked the temperament and means to carry them out. The peace concluded between John and the English in September 1427, alongside his tenacity and bad temper, led to his expulsion from the court, where Georges de la TrÃ©moille, whom he himself had recommended to the king, remained supreme for six years, during which Arthur tried in vain to overthrow him.

As Constable of France, Arthur fought alongside Joan of Arc during her victory at the Battle of Patay on 18 June 1429. He joined his brother John in the siege of PouancÃ© in 1432, where he notably but reluctantly fought alongside English captains, as the Duke of Brittany was allied with the English at the time. Around this time he received an offer from the Duke of Bedford (who hoped to exploit the conflict between Richemont and la TrÃ©moille), which included TrÃ©moille&#x27;s lands in Poitou in return for him switching sides. Poitou was not in English hands; still he found more prudent to seize those lands through less strenuous means. On 5 March 1432 Charles VII concluded with him and with Brittany the treaty of Rennes; but it was not until June of the following year that TrÃ©moille was overthrown. Arthur now resumed the war against the English, and at the same time took vigorous measures against the plundering bands of soldiers and peasants known as &quot;routiers&quot; or &quot;Ã©corcheurs&quot;.

By 1435 he had regained his influence at the French court and then helped arrange the Treaty of Arras between Charles VII and Philip III, Duke of Burgundy. This treaty cemented the peace between France and Burgundy, leading to the eventual defeat of the English. He was commander of the French army at the Battle of Formigny on 15 April 1450, the next-to-the-last battle of the Hundred Years&#x27; War which sealed the reconquest of Normandy. In the wake of the battle he successfully laid siege to Caen.

It was not till May 1444 that the Treaty of Tours gave him leisure to carry out the reorganization of the army which he had long projected. He now created the &quot;compagnies d&#x27;ordonnance&quot;, and endeavoured to organize the militia of the &quot;francs archers&quot;. This reform had its effect in the struggles that followed. In alliance with his nephew, the duke of Brittany, he reconquered, during September and October 1449, nearly all the Cotentin; and after the battle of Formigny he recovered for France the whole of Normandy, which for the next six or seven years it was his task to defend from English attacks. On the death of his nephew Peter II, on 22 September 1457, he became duke of Brittany, and though retaining his office of constable of France, he refused, like his predecessors, to do homage to the French king for his duchy. He reigned little more than a year, dying on 26 December 1458.

==Family==
Arthur was married three times.

His wives were as follows:
# married in Dijon on 10 October 1423 Margaret of Burgundy (d. 1441), daughter of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy and widow of Dauphin Louis, Duke of Guyenne.
# married in NÃ©rac c. 29 August 1442 Jeanne II d&#x27;Albret (d. 1444), daughter of Charles II, Count of Dreux and Anne of Armagnac (1402 â before March 1473). Jeanne II d&#x27;Albret was Countess of Dreux. Their marriage had no descendants.
# married on 2 July 1445 Catherine of Luxembourg-Saint-Pol (d. 1492), daughter of Peter of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol

Arthur also had a natural daughter named Jacqueline who was legitimatized in 1443.

==Succession==
Arthur died with no known legitimate issue. He was succeeded as Duke of Brittany by his nephew Francis II, Count of Ãtampes.

<text>Notarchus is a genus of sea slugs or sea hares, marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusks in the family Aplysiidae, the sea hares.

==Description==
The parapodia (fleshy winglike outgrowths) of &quot;Notarchus&quot; are almost completely fused, forming the parapodial cavity.

==Life habits==
These sea hares are able to swim by jet propulsion, through sucking in water through the small anterior opening of the parapodial cavity and then squirting water from the back of it. While doing so, they tumble and make a series of backward somersaults. In this unusual manner, they move quickly out of harm&#x27;s way over short distances.

==Species==
Species within the genus &quot;Notarchus&quot; include:
*&quot;Notarchus indicus&quot; Schweigger, 1820 : Indian sea hare
**Distribution : in shallow waters of NW Indian Ocean, NW Pacific, Mediterranean.
**Description : fine papillae scattered over the mantle; no armed penis; feeds on green alga Caulerpa.
*&quot;Notarchus punctatus&quot; Philippi, 1836
**Distribution : Japan, Indo-Chinese seas, Mediterranean.
**Length : 5Â cm
**Description : penis with spines.

;Species brought into synonymy:
* &quot;Notarchus ceylonicus&quot; Farran, 1905: synonym of &quot;Notarchus indicus&quot; Schweigger, 1820
* &quot;Notarchus pleii&quot; (Rang, 1828): synonym of &quot;Bursatella leachii&quot; pleii Rang, 1828
* &quot;Notarchus polyomma&quot; MÃ¶rch, 1863: synonym of &quot;Stylocheilus striatus&quot; (Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1832)

<text>James Sowerby (21 March 1757 â 25 October 1822) was an English naturalist, illustrator and mineralogist. Contributions to published works, such as &quot;A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland&quot; or &quot;English Botany&quot;, include his detailed and appealing plates. The use of vivid colour and accessible texts was intended to reach a widening audience in works of natural history. 

== Biography ==
James Sowerby was born in Lambeth, London, his parents were named John and Arabella. Having decided to become a painter of flowers his first venture was with William Curtis, whose &quot;Flora Londinensis&quot; he illustrated.
Sowerby studied art at the Royal Academy and took an apprenticeship with Richard Wright. He married Anne Brettingham De Carle and they were to have four daughters and three sons: James De Carle Sowerby (1787â1871), George Brettingham Sowerby I (1788â1854) and Charles Edward Sowerby (1795â1842), the Sowerby family of naturalists. His sons and theirs were to contribute and continue the enormous volumes he was to begin and the Sowerby name was to remain associated with illustration of natural history.

An early commission for Sowerby was to lead to his prominence in the field when the botanist L&#x27;HÃ©rtier de Brutelle invited Sowerby to provide the plates for his monograph, &quot;Geranologia&quot;, and two later works. He also came to the notice of William Curtis, who was undertaking a new type of publication. Early volumes of the first British botany journal, &quot;The Botanical Magazine&quot;, contained fifty-six of his illustrations.

In 1790, he began the first of several huge projects: a 36-volume work, &quot;English Botany&quot; that was published over the next 23 years, contained 2,592 hand-coloured engravings and became known as &quot;Sowerby&#x27;s Botany&quot;. An enormous number of plants were to receive their first formal publication within this work, but the authority for these came from the initially unattributed text written by James Edward Smith. The work was continued by his son, James de Carle Sowerby who published a further set of 204 plates, mostly uncoloured until the end of the first edition in 1835. Further plates were added by other hands up to 1865 ending with plate number 2,999.

It was the inclusion of science in the form of natural history, such as the thousands of botanicals supplied by Smith or his own research, that distinguished Sowerby&#x27;s art from early forms of still life. This careful description of the subjects, drawing from specimens and research, was in contrast to the flower painting of the Rococo period found illuminating the books and galleries of a select audience. Sowerby intended to reach an audience whose curiosity for gardening and the natural world could be piqued by publishing the attractive and more affordable works. The appealing hand-coloured engravings also became highly valued by researchers into the new fields of science.

His next project was of similar scale: the &quot;Mineral Conchology of Great Britain&quot;, a comprehensive catalogue of many invertebrate fossils found in England, was published over a 34-year time-span, the latter parts by his sons James De Carle Sowerby and George Brettingham Sowerby I. The finished work contains 650 coloured plates distributed over 7 volumes.

He also developed a theory of colour and published two landmark illustrated works on mineralogy: the &quot;British Mineralogy&quot; (1804â1817) and as a supplement to it the &quot;Exotic Mineralogy&quot; (1811â1820).
Sowerby retained the specimens used in the expansive volumes he helped to produce. Many notable geologists and other scientists of the day were to lend or donate specimens to his collection. He had intended that his some thousands of minerals, many not known elsewhere, a great variety of fossils, most of the plants of English Botany about 500 preserved specimens or models of fungi, quadrupeds, birds, insects, &amp;c. all the natural production of Great Britain become the foundation of a museum. The addition of a room at the rear of his residence, housing this collection, was to see visits from the president of the Royal Society, Joseph Banks, and Charles Francis Greville who also lent to the informal institution. A much-sought exhibit, one that was frequently chipped for samples, was the Yorkshire meteorite; this was sighted and collected in 1795, the first recorded English meteorite.

== Legacy ==
James&#x27; great-grandson, the explorer and naturalist Arthur de Carle Sowerby continued the family tradition, providing many specimens for the British Museum and museums in Shanghai and Washington D.C.

He is also commemorated in the naming of several taxa of plants including; &quot;Sowerbaea&quot;, a genus of plant in Asparagaceae family, by Sm. in 1798,
&quot;Sowerbea&quot;, a (possible) genus of plant in Liliaceae family by Dum.Cours. in 1814, and &quot;Soberbaea&quot; a (possible) genus of plant in (Liliaceae family) by D.Dietr. in 1840. Lastly, John Axel Nannfeldt in Svensk Bot. Tidskr. vol.32 on page 118 in 1938, published &quot;Sowerbyella&quot; which is a genus of fungi in the family Pyronemataceae.

== Publications ==

James Sowerby produced a large corpus of work that appeared in many different publications and journals. Some of the works begun by the &quot;paterfamilias&quot; of the Sowerby&#x27;s was to be completed only by the generations that followed. His illustrations, publication and publishing concerns embraced many of the emergent fields of science. Besides the renowned botanical works, Sowerby produced extensive volumes on mycology, conchology, mineralogy and a seminal work on his colour system. He also wrote an instruction called &quot;A botanical drawing-book, or an easy introduction to drawing flowers according to nature.&quot;
* &quot;Florist&#x27;s luxurians&quot; or the florist&#x27;s delight, and;
* Sibthrop&#x27;s &quot;Flora Graeca&quot;, 10 vols. 1806â40.
* Sowerby also supplied plates for Curtis&#x27;s &quot;Flora Londinensis&quot;.
* &quot;English Botany&quot; or, &quot;Coloured Figures of British Plants, with their Essential Characters, Synonyms and Places of Growth&quot;, descriptions supplied by Sir James E. Smith, was issued as a part work over 23 years until its completion in March 1814. This work was issued in 36 volumes with 2,592 hand-coloured plates of British plants. He also published &quot;Exotic Botany&quot; in 1804.
* Smith&#x27;s comprehensive work did not include Kingdom Fungi, Sowerby set out to supplement &quot;English Botany&quot; with his own text and descriptions. &quot;Coloured figures of English fungi or mushrooms&quot;, 4 vols. both appeared between 1789 and 1791.
* &quot;A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland&quot; Written by James Edward Smith and illustrated by James Sowerby, it was published by Sowerby between 1793 and 1795, becoming the first monograph on the Flora of Australia. It was prefaced with the intention of meeting the general interest in, and propagation of, the flowering species of the new antipodean colonies, while also containing a Latin and botanical description of the sample. Sowerby&#x27;s own hand-coloured engravings, based upon original sketches and specimens brought to England, were both descriptive and striking in depiction.
* &quot;Zoology of New Holland&quot; by George Shaw and illustrated by James Sowerby. Published by Sowerby in 1794.
* &quot;The British miscellany, or, Coloured figures of new, rare, or little known animal subjects : many not before ascertained to be inhabitants of the British Isles : and chiefly in the possession of the author, James Sowerby&quot;[1804-1806].
* &quot;Mineral Conchology of Great Britain &quot;Digital version
* &quot;British Mineralogy: Or Coloured figures intended to elucidate the mineralogy of Great Britain&quot; (R. Taylor and co., London) was published as parts between 1802 and 1817.
* &quot;Exotic Mineralogy: Or Coloured Figures of Foreign Minerals, as a Supplement to British Mineralogy&quot; (1811), followed &quot;British Mineralogy&quot; and the scope was extended to include American specimens. Issued by subscription, the work ran to two volumes that comprised an incomplete 27 parts. Descriptions of rarities held in the &#x27;mineral cabinets&#x27; of many notable collectors included 167 plates, brilliantly coloured by Sowerby and his family.
* &quot;A New Elucidation of Colours, Original Prismatic and Material: Showing Their Concordance in the Three Primitives, Yellow, Red and Blue: and the Means of Producing, Measuring and Mixing Them: with some Observations on the Accuracy of Sir Isaac Newton&quot;, London 1809. This work, given in homage to Isaac Newton, was to establish the importance of &#x27;light and dark&#x27; in colour theory. He presents a theory of colour being composed of three basic colours: red, yellow and blue. Yellow, or gamboge as he had it, would become substituted by green in the later colour systems which were based on it.
* &quot;Familiar Lessons on Mineralogy and Geology&quot; (digital version), and other publications by John Mawe.

<text>William Erasmus Darwin (27 December 18398 September 1914) was the first-born son, and the eldest of all the children of Charles and Emma Darwin, and the subject of psychological studies by his father. 

==Life==
He was educated at Rugby School and Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and later became a banker at Grant and Maddison&#x27;s Union Banking Company in Southampton. In 1877 he married an American, Sara Price Ashburner Sedgwick (1839 1902), daughter of Theodore Sedgwick. William was a great believer in university education being available to all, and championed the establishment of a university college in Southampton in 1902. The Darwins had no children of their own, and after his wife died, William devoted himself much to his nieces Gwen Raverat, Frances Cornford, and Margaret Keynes. William died on 8 September 1914 at Sedbergh in Cumbria. Raverat remembered him fondly as an eccentric and entirely unselfconscious man in her childhood memoirs &quot;Period Piece&quot; (1952).

William is primarily notable as a subject of Charles Darwin&#x27;s studies of infant psychology. Darwin was very fond of his son; at his birth he called him &quot;a prodigy of beauty &amp; intellect&quot;, and named him after his own grandfather Erasmus Darwin. During William&#x27;s first three years his father kept a diary of gestures and facial expressions the infant made. The studies were part of Darwin&#x27;s comparison between animal and human development, after he had already thoroughly studied orangutan babies at the London Zoo. The diary contains observations on the child learning to follow a candle with his eyes after nine days, smiling with his eyes after six weeks and three days, and developing distinctive cries adjusted to specific situations after eleven weeks. He also noticed the development of more profound personality traits, such as reason and, at two-and-a-half years, conscience. 

Charles Darwin published his findings in the journal &quot;Mind&quot; in June 1877, in an article titled &quot;A biographical sketch of an infant&quot;. The studies were also an influence behind his work &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;, published in 1872. Darwin&#x27;s work on infant development and child psychology inspired other academics, such as the German psychologist William Preyer and the American James Mark Baldwin, who acknowledged Darwin&#x27;s influence in his 1913 &quot;History of Psychology&quot;. 
William was a keen amateur photographer, and took several portraits of members of his family. 

William Darwin and his wife are buried in St. Nicolas&#x27; Church, North Stoneham, Hampshire; having lived in Bassett, near Southampton, Hampshire.

<doc id="640465" wikidata="Q4964233" url="?curid=640465" title="Brian Johnston">
<text>Brian Alexander Johnston (24 June 1912 â 5 January 1994), nicknamed Johnners, was a British cricket commentator, author, and television presenter. He was most prominently associated with the BBC during a career which lasted from 1946 until his death in January 1994.

==Early life==
Brian Alexander Johnston was born on Monday, 24 June 1912 at the Old Rectory, Little Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, the youngest of four children (elder siblings were Anne, Michael and Christopher). His paternal grandfather, Reginald Eden Johnston, had been Governor of the Bank of England between 1909 and 1911. The World War II airborne division commander Frederick &#x27;Boy&#x27; Browning was his first cousin. On 27 August 1922, his father, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Evelyn Johnston, DSO, MC, who managed the family coffee business, drowned at Widemouth Sands near Bude, Cornwall at the age of 44. In 1924, his mother married one of her husband&#x27;s military colleagues, Captain Marcus Scully, who became his stepfather. After the marriage ended in divorce, she reverted to her original married name.

==Education==
Johnston was educated at Temple Grove Preparatory School (1920â25) and then at Eton (1925â31), where he played cricket for the school&#x27;s 2nd XI. He subsequently went on to New College, Oxford (1931â34), where he graduated with a third in History in 1934. At Oxford he was a keen cricketer, keeping wicket for his college team, Oxford Authentics, and also for the Eton Ramblers and I Zingari, but he never managed to progress to the Varsity side.

==Pre-war employment==
After Oxford, Johnston joined the family&#x27;s coffee business, where he worked until 1939, but admitted years later that he had little interest or liking for the work. After a year at head office in the City of London, he was transferred to the Hamburg office in 1935, as Germany was an important market for Brazilian coffee.

The following year, he travelled to Santos, Brazil, where he worked in the company office for 18 months. However, in 1938, he was struck down with an acute neurological condition and had to return to London. After several months&#x27; convalescence he returned to the City office in October but resigned the following year to join the army on the outbreak of the Second World War.

==Second World War==
In September 1939, Johnston joined the 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards, and was sent for officer training to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Following this, he was posted to the Grenadiers Training Battalion, based at Windsor, in the spring of 1940, where he served as a Technical Adjutant. His unit was due to join the British Expeditionary Force in France during May, but these plans were overtaken by the retreat from Dunkirk. He remained stationed in the United Kingdom until the invasion of Europe in the summer of 1944, when his battalion landed at Arromanches on the Normandy coast some three weeks after D Day. In the winter of 1944 and early spring of 1945, Johnston and his armoured division were in the thick of the allied advance, crossing the Rhine and fighting their way up to Bremen and Hamburg. He was later awarded the Military Cross in 1946 for his actions as technical adjutant after the battalion crossed the Rhine. Tanks were frequently stranded in the marshy ground and he was responsible for recovering these, and battle-damaged tanks, often under fire.

==BBC career==
Brian Johnston joined the BBC in January 1946 and began his cricket commentating career at Lord&#x27;s for BBC Television in June 1946 at the England v India Test match.

===General light entertainment===
In these early years, Johnston was an occasional presenter of other BBC shows, including &quot;Come Dancing&quot; and &quot;All Your Own&quot;. Between 1948 and 1952, Johnston presented a live broadcast segment &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Somewhere&quot; as part of the Saturday night radio series &quot;In Town Tonight&quot;. In some he stayed alone in the Chamber of Horrors, rode a circus horse, lay under a passing train, was hauled out of the sea by a helicopter and was attacked by a police dog.

He was also part of the radio commentating team for major state occasions such as the funeral of King George VI in 1952, the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, the Sovereign&#x27;s annual birthday parade, the annual El Alamein reunion and in due course the royal weddings of Princess Margaret, Princess Anne and the Prince of Wales. He also appeared on other radio programmes such as &quot;Sporting Chance&quot;, &quot;Treble Chance&quot;, &quot;Twenty Questions&quot;, &quot;Married To Fame&quot;, &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; and occasionally as an outside broadcast interviewer for the &quot;Today&quot; programme.

===Cricket commentator===
Johnston became a regular member of the TV commentary team and, in addition, became BBC cricket correspondent in 1963. In that year he also met and mentored his future TMS colleague the late Christopher Martin-Jenkins, who sought his advice about how to become a cricket commentator while still at school. From 1965 onwards Johnston split his commentary duties between television (three Tests) and radio (two Tests) each summer. In 1970 Johnston was dropped from the TV commentary team and he retired from the BBC two years later on his sixtieth birthday. However, he continued to appear in a freelance capacity as a member of the team for the radio broadcasts, &quot;Test Match Special&quot; (TMS) for the next 22 years. Johnston was responsible for a number of the TMS traditions, including the creation, often using the so-called Oxford &quot;-er&quot;, of the nicknames of fellow commentators (for example, Jonathan Agnew is still known as &quot;Aggers&quot;, Henry Blofeld as &quot;Blowers&quot;, and the late Bill Frindall (&quot;the Bearded Wonder&quot;) as &quot;Bearders&quot;). He once complained on air that he had missed his cake at tea during one match, and he was subsequently inundated with cakes from listeners. Even decades after Johnston&#x27;s death, the &quot;TMS&quot; team has continued to receive cakes from listeners ever since.

===&quot;Down Your Way&quot;===
In 1972, he was asked to stand in as the host of the long-running Sunday evening radio programme &quot;Down Your Way&quot; (first broadcast in 1946) when Franklin Engelmann, who had hosted the programme since 1953, died very suddenly. He went on to host a further ten editions before leaving to commence his last full-time summer as the BBC cricket correspondent. He was compulsorily retired from the BBC in September of that year having reached his 60th birthday. He was then contracted in a freelance capacity to host &quot;Down Your Way&quot; on a permanent basis since four other hosts trialled over the summer had proved to be less popular than him. He went on to present this programme for 15 years before bowing out on his 733rd show (equalling Engelmann&#x27;s tenure) in May 1987 just before his 75th birthday. The final show featured Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground and included an interview with his old friend Denis Compton. A valedictory photograph was taken showing Johnston standing in front of the Lord&#x27;s scoreboard, which showed 733 under the icon of Last Man to commemorate the event.

Thereafter the programme continued to be broadcast for a further five years, with a different celebrity host every week, before it was finally taken off the air in 1992.

===Commentary humour===
Johnston was renowned for his on-air schoolboy humour and puns. In one incident during a Test match at the Oval in August 1991, Jonathan Agnew suggested that when Ian Botham was out hit wicket, trying to hurdle the stumps, it was because he had failed to &quot;get his leg over&quot; (a British slang term meaning to have sex; Botham&#x27;s sexual exploits had attracted national attention). Johnston carried on commentating and giggling for 30 seconds before dissolving into helpless laughter.

Johnston&#x27;s love for practical jokes was routinely evident. Due to the near-endless supply of cakes, his favourite one was to ask people questions on-air after they had taken a slab of cake into their mouth and before they could reply.

In one broadcast, Johnston stated of South African cricketer Peter Pollock, who had broken his ankle: &quot;Heâs obviously in great pain. Itâs especially bad luck as he is here on his honeymoon with his pretty young wife. Still, heâll probably be all right tomorrow if he sticks it up tonight.&quot; &quot;Sticks it up&quot; could be interpreted either as using crutches or as having sex.

Among his other gaffes were: &quot;There&#x27;s Neil Harvey standing at leg slip with his legs wide apart, waiting for a tickle&quot;, which he uttered when Harvey was representing Australia at the Headingley Test in 1961.

Johnston is reputed to have said &quot;The bowler&#x27;s Holding; the batsman&#x27;s Willey&quot; while commentating, which supposedly occurred when Michael Holding of the West Indies was bowling to Peter Willey of England in a Test match at The Oval in 1976. This is now considered apocryphal; Johnston claimed not to have noticed saying anything odd during the match, and that he was only alerted to his gaffe by a letter from &quot;a lady&quot; named &quot;Miss Mainpiece&quot;. According to Christopher Martin-Jenkins, his Cricinfo biography, and the biography by Johnston&#x27;s son Barry, Johnston never actually made the remark. Barry Johnston says &quot;It was too good a pun to resist ... but Brian never actually said that he had spoken the words on air.&quot; Holding himself has expressed his doubt about the phrase ever being said, pointing out that no recording of it exists. Henry Blofeld and former TMS Producer Peter Baxter have also said that Johnston is unlikely to have said it, noting that attempts were made to find the recording to play at Johnston&#x27;s funeral, but these were unsuccessful.

==Apartheid in South Africa==
During 1970 and 1983, Johnston said that he disapproved of the boycotts of South Africa by England cricket teams as he believed that sport and politics should not be mixed. He had disagreements with John Arlott who backed the boycotts. Apartheid was ended shortly after Johnston&#x27;s death.

==Other TV and film work==
Johnston variously presented and participated in a wide range of BBC radio and television programmes. These included the Royal Command Performance of &quot;The Good Life&quot; in 1978. Johnston was also one of the presenters of the Channel 4 magazine programme for the over sixties for several years &quot;Years Ahead&quot; along with Robert Dougall, Zena Skinner and Paul Lewis. He appeared as himself in the 1952 British film &quot;Derby Day&quot;. In 1989 he lent his famous voice in the tenth episode of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1982 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in London&#x27;s Sloane Square.

==One-man live performances==
Johnston was a great fan of the British Music Hall and revelled in its often mildly risquÃ© &quot;schoolboy humour&quot;. &quot;An Evening with Johnners&quot;, a one-man show that he performed towards the end of his life, was recorded and released, and reached number 46 on the UK Albums Chart in March 1994, two months after his death.

==Personal life==
On 22 April 1948 Johnston married Pauline Tozer, sister of his former army colleague Gordon. They had five children: Barry, Clare, Andrew, Ian and Joanna. His youngest daughter, Joanna, was born with Down&#x27;s syndrome. Pauline died in Sonning, Berkshire in September 2013 at the age of 90.

Johnston was appointed OBE in 1983 and CBE in 1991. 

==Death==
In the Autumn of 1993, Johnston undertook a series of UK theatre tours, entertaining live audiences as a raconteur. On the morning of 2 December 1993, whilst in a taxi going to Paddington station en route to Bristol where he was due to fill a speaking engagement, he suffered a massive heart attack. The taxi took Johnston to the nearest hospital, Maida Vale, where he was revived at the hospital entrance, having suffered a cardiac arrest. He was then transferred to St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington, where he remained until 14 December when he was transferred to the King Edward VII Hospital for Officers. He remained there until just before Christmas.

Brian Johnston died on 5 January 1994, at the King Edward VII Hospital for Officers in Marylebone, London, having been admitted the previous day. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described him as &quot;the greatest natural broadcaster of them all&quot;, and British Prime Minister and cricket fan John Major said that &quot;Summers simply won&#x27;t be the same without him&quot;. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 16 May 1994 with over 2,000 people present.

==The Johnners Trust==
As a memorial to Johnston, his familyâtogether with some eminent members from cricket and broadcastingâestablished a trust fund to further causes close to Johnston&#x27;s heart. The Johnners Trust (originally the Brian Johnston Memorial Trust) was established in 1995 to promote cricket in schools and youth clubs, to help young cricketers requiring financial support and to promote disabled cricket. The trust is now part of the Lord&#x27;s Taverners. The Johnners Club was also established in his memory at the same time and currently has over 350 members, plus a further 100 regular supporters. The trust&#x27;s income is boosted significantly from the proceeds of the annual Johnners Club Dinner in the Long Room at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, member subscriptions, and general donations.

<text>Charles Radclyffe (3 September 1693 â 8 December 1746), titular 5th Earl of Derwentwater, was one of the few English participants in the Risings of 1715 and 1745.

The Radclyffes were Catholics from Northumberland, with long-standing links to the exiled Stuarts; sentenced to death in 1716, he escaped and spent the next 30 years in Europe. He was captured at sea along with his eldest son in November 1745 en route to Scotland and executed on 8 December 1746, under the warrant issued in 1716. His son James was released and later settled in Slindon, West Sussex.

==Life==

Charles was born 3 September 1693 in Little Parndon, Essex, third and youngest son of Edward, 2nd Earl of Derwentwater (1655â1705) and Lady Mary Tudor (1673â1726), an illegitimate daughter of Charles II. He had two brothers and a sister; James, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater (1689â1716), Francis (1691â1715) and Mary (1697â1756). His brother Francis died in France, in May 1715.

On 24 June 1724, he married Charlotte Maria Livingston (1694â1755), daughter of the 2nd Earl of Newburgh and widow of Thomas Clifford. Their children included James, who inherited his mother&#x27;s title in 1755, and Mary (1732â1798). He also had a daughter, Jane (1715â1755) from a relationship with Margaret Snowden (1697â1723). She is the main character in the 1962 novel &quot;Devil Water&quot; by Anya Seton that also features Radclyffe.

==Career==
The Radclyffes were Catholics, with long-standing links to the Stuarts; his grandfather Sir Francis Radclyffe (1625â1697) was created Earl of Derwentwater by Charles II upon his son, Edward Radclyffe, marrying Lady Mary Tudor. His grandmother, Catherine Fenwick, came from another long-established Northumberland family; her brother Sir John Fenwick was executed in 1697 for conspiracy to assassinate William III. 

His elder brother James was educated at the exile court in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where he was companion to James Francis Edward Stuart. Allowed to return to England in 1709, he and Charles joined the 1715 Rising, with a troop of 70 servants and friends. Captured at Preston, they were both found guilty of treason and condemned to death. Witnesses at the trial claimed Charles was in command, but despite efforts to save him, James was executed at Tower Hill in February 1716 and his title died with him. In December 1716, Charles escaped from Newgate Prison with 13 other prisoners when a door was left open, and made his way to France.

He spent many years in Rome, the location of the Stuart court post-1718, including a period as private secretary to Prince Charles. His nephew John, de jure 4th Earl Derwentwater, died in 1731, leaving a legacy to &quot;my kinsman, Mr Thompson&quot;, which may refer to an alias used by Charles, who now styled himself 5th Earl Derwentwater. He visited London and Essex in 1733 and 1739, reputedly with the knowledge of the government.

Like many Jacobites, he was a Freemason, who reportedly served as Grandmaster of the Grande Loge de France in 1738. He is also listed as an officer in the Order of the Fleur de Lys, one of several organisations claiming to inherit the legacy of the Knights Templar; the Order still exists, although the more fantastic assertions have since been disproved.

In November 1745, during the Jacobite Rising, Charles and his son James boarded a French ship taking arms and supplies from Dunkirk to the Scottish port of Montrose. It was intercepted in the North Sea by HMS Sheerness and the two were taken to the Tower of London. Charles had been commissioned into Dillon&#x27;s Regiment, part of the Franco-Irish Brigade, a common technique used in hopes of being treated as a prisoner of war if captured, rather than a rebel. Francis Towneley, colonel of the Manchester Regiment, also employed this defence but the authorities carefully scrutinised such claims and rejected the vast majority. Lord Chancellor Hardwicke used the 1716 warrant to execute Charles in December 1746; although technically not a peer, he was beheaded, rather than being hanged, drawn and quartered, the normal fate for those found guilty of treason.

If he had not escaped in 1716, Charles would in all probability have been pardoned, but the government was particularly harsh on families and individuals seen as habitual or repeat offenders. In a letter to his wife Charlotte the night before his execution, Charles refers to &quot;Fanny, that other mother of my dear children.&quot; This is generally taken to refer to Lady Frances Clifford, Charlotte&#x27;s sister-in-law from her first marriage, who may have assisted in bringing up Radclyffe&#x27;s own children. He was buried in the church of St Giles in the Fields, Camden.

James was released and pardoned under the 1747 Act of Indemnity; in 1749, he married Barbara Kempe, another Catholic, whose family owned Slindon House near Slindon, West Sussex. He unsuccessfully petitioned for the return of the Derwentwater estates, which reverted to the government after the death of John Radclyffe in 1731 and the income assigned to the Greenwich Hospital. He succeeded his mother as Earl of Newburgh in 1755.

<text>Zyzomys is a genus of rodents with unusually thick, long tails. Five species of the genus are known in Australia, where they are called rock rats or thick-tailed rats. The genus was classified by Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas in 1909.

==Taxonomy==
There are five known species of rock-rat. The central rock rat (&quot;Zyzomys pedunculatus&quot;) was once believed to be extinct until rediscovered in 1996.

*Silver-tailed rock rat, &quot;Zyzomys argurus&quot;
*Arnhem Land rock rat, &quot;Zyzomys maini&quot;
*Carpentarian rock rat, &quot;Zyzomys palatilis&quot;

<text>Anne Elizabeth Darwin (2 March 1841 â 23 April 1851) was the second child and eldest daughter of Charles and Emma Darwin.
==Life==
Darwin scholar E. Janet Browne writes:
In 1849, Anne caught scarlet fever along with her two sisters, and her health thereafter declined; some authorities believe that she suffered from tuberculosis. In vain pursuit of help from James Manby Gully&#x27;s water cure, Charles Darwin took his daughter to the Worcestershire spa town, Great Malvern. She died in Montreal House on the Worcester Road, aged ten, and was buried in the Great Malvern Priory churchyard.

Annie&#x27;s death was a terrible blow for her parents. Charles wrote in a personal memoir &quot;We have lost the joy of the household, and the solace of our old age... Oh that she could now know how deeply, how tenderly we do still &amp; and shall ever love her dear joyous face.&quot;

The loss of Charles Darwin&#x27;s beloved daughter was softened only by the addition of Horace Darwin, who was born only three weeks after Anne&#x27;s death on 13 May 1851.

==Annie&#x27;s Box==
Around 2000, Charles Darwin&#x27;s great-great-grandson Randal Keynes discovered a box containing keepsakes of Anne collected by Charles and Emma. He wrote a biography of Charles Darwin centred on the relationship between Darwin and his daughter, entitled &quot;Annie&#x27;s Box&quot;; the script of the 2009 film &quot;Creation&quot; is based on the book.

<text>Hornchurch is a London Underground station serving the town of Hornchurch in the London Borough of Havering, east London. It is on the District line between to the west and to the east. It is along the line from the eastern terminus at and to in central London where the line divides into numerous branches.

The station was originally opened on 1 May 1885 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway on a new direct route from London to Southend that avoided Tilbury. The station was completely rebuilt in 1932 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and an additional pair of platforms were constructed to serve the electric District Railway local service which was extended from to Upminster. The Southend service was withdrawn from Hornchurch and the original platforms abandoned in 1962.

The single-storey brick building is of a common design also constructed at other stations on the eastern portion of the line at the time.

==History==

===Steam era===
The original 1854 route of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway passed through the south of the parish of Hornchurch near the River Thames without stopping; the nearest station was at Rainham. Between 1885 and 1888 a new route authorised as the Barking and Pitsea Railway was constructed, that provided a direct service from Fenchurch Street to Southend, avoiding Tilbury. The station at Hornchurch opened on 1 May 1885; the next station to the east was Upminster and to the west was Dagenham. The Whitechapel and Bow Railway opened in 1902 and allowed through services of the Metropolitan District Railway to operate as far as Upminster. The District Railway converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were lost at Hornchurch as they were cut back to East Ham. The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway was purchased by the Midland Railway in 1912 and was amalgamated into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on 1 January 1923.

===Underground electric===

The District Railway electric service was extended east from East Ham to Barking in 1908. Delayed by World War I, an additional pair of electrified fourth rail tracks were extended by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to Upminster and services of the District resumed at Hornchurch in 1932. To coincide with the introduction of electric services, the station was rebuilt with two additional platforms and a new ticket office spanning the tracks facing onto Station Lane. The Metropolitan District Railway amalgamated with several other transport concerns to form London Transport in 1933, and became known as the District line. A new station at Upminster Bridge became the next station to the east in 1934 and Elm Park was added to the west in 1935. The 1947 timetable shows only a few services a day provided by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and a frequent service provided by the District.
===British Railways===
After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways. The remaining Fenchurch StreetâSouthend services were withdrawn in 1962 when the route was electrified with overhead lines. Barking station was reconfigured to provide cross-platform interchange between District line and Fenchurch Street services. The continued management of the station by an organisation now providing none of the services became more of an anomaly and in 1969 ownership transferred to the London Underground which came under the authority of the London Transport Executive of the Greater London Council.

==Design==

The station consists of two side platformsânumbered 1 for westbound and 2 for eastboundâlocated either side of the running tracks. There are four tracks through the site, with the platforms located on the northern pair. Another pair of tracks to the south are used by c2c outer suburban services and there are disused platforms on those lines. The operational platforms are mostly covered by station canopies with a waiting room and toilets on the westbound platform. The red brick ticket office is located at street level above the platforms, to which it is connected by a covered footbridge stairway. The 1930s architecture is similar in design to Becontree and Dagenham East and is contemporary with the introduction of electric services. The platform benches are of Midland Railway (1912â1922) design. The station had a track crossover, to the west of the platforms, enabling trains to terminate there and return to service in the opposite direction. However, this was removed in 2016.

As part of the publicâprivate partnership arrangement for maintenance of the London Underground, the station was due to be refurbished by Metronet. Following the collapse of Metronet, responsibility of station upkeep was transferred to Transport for London in 2008. Works were planned to include provision of tactile strips and colour contrasted handrails for the visually impaired, installation of closed-circuit television cameras, passenger help points, new electronic departure information displays on the platforms, a new public address system, and improved lighting. Transport for London has assigned the station to the &#x27;limited works&#x27; category and plans to complete these improvements incrementally, according to the need to preserve assets. The station does not have step free access from the platforms to the street, although there are two out of use lift shafts from the platforms to the booking hall.

==Location==

The station is named after the town of Hornchurch in which it is situated approximately south of the high street. The station is located on Station Lane in the London Borough of Havering and is surrounded by a cluster of shops. It is in a primarily residential area and is near to St George&#x27;s Hospital and Hornchurch Country Park. Upminster Bridge is to the northeast of the station and Elm Park is to the southwest. A 68 space station car park, managed by National Car Parks, is accessed from Naunton Way.

London Buses routes 165, 193, 248, 252, 256, 370, 372 and school routes 646, 648 and 652 serve the station, providing connections to Collier Row, County Park Estate, Cranham, Lakeside Shopping Centre, Noak Hill, Queen&#x27;s Hospital, Rainham, Romford and St George&#x27;s Hospital. 

==Services==
The station is in London fare zone 6. The typical off-peak service from the station is twelve District line trains per hour to Upminster and twelve to Earl&#x27;s Court, of which six continue to Ealing Broadway and six continue to Richmond. At peak periods the number of trains per hour increases to fifteen and some trains continue from Earl&#x27;s Court to Wimbledon. Services towards central London operate from approximately 05:00 to 23:30 and services to Upminster operate from approximately 06:00 to 01:30. The journey time to Upminster is four minutes; to Barking is approximately 15 minutes, and to Tower Hill is approximately 40 minutes. The station has a ticket office that is open for eleven hours a week. During 2011 there were 1.98 million passenger entries and exits at the station, higher than the annual usage over the preceding two years, and typical for a suburban station.

<doc id="640474" wikidata="Q391061" url="?curid=640474" title="Kirov-class cruiser">
<text>The &quot;Kirov&quot;-class (Project 26) cruisers were a class of six cruisers built in the late 1930s for the Soviet Navy. After the first two ships, armor protection was increased and subsequent ships are sometimes called the &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; class. These were the first large ships built by the Soviets from the keel up after the Russian Civil War, and they were derived from the , being designed with assistance from the Italian Ansaldo company. Two ships each were deployed in the Black and Baltic Seas during World War II, while the last pair was still under construction in the Russian Far East and saw no combat during the war. The first four ships bombarded Axis troops and facilities after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. All six ships survived the war and lingered in training and other secondary roles, with three being scrapped in the early 1960s and the other three a decade later.

==Design==
Following the October Revolution and the subsequent Russian Civil War, Soviet industry was not capable of designing large, complex warships by itself and sought foreign assistance. The Ansaldo company provided plans for the contemporary &quot;Raimondo Montecuccoli&quot;-class cruisers and a design displacing and armed with six guns in twin turrets was produced in 1933. The Italians guaranteed that the cruiser could make on trials if the size was kept under the 7200-tonne limit. The designer of the new turret managed to persuade his superiors that he could fit triple turrets to the ship while keeping it within the specified limit, and this design was approved in November 1934 as the Project 26.

The Soviets bought an example of, and plans for, the machinery of the later &quot;Duca d&#x27;Aosta&quot;-class cruisers and had some difficulty in adapting the smaller hull for the larger and more-powerful machinery, so much so that it delayed the start of construction. Another problem was that the Italian design had to be adapted to use the Soviet preference for a mix of longitudinal framing for the hull framing amidships and transverse framing for the ends, while also reinforcing the hull structure to withstand the more-severe weather conditions that the Soviets commonly encountered.

The &quot;Kirov&quot;s were built in pairs, each pair incorporating some improvements over the earlier pair. These pairs were designated as the Project 26, Project 26bis, and Project 26bis2 in sequence. The differences between pairs usually related to size, armor, armament and aircraft.

===General characteristics===
The Project 26 class ships were long overall. They had a beam of and at full load a draft of . They displaced at standard load, and at full load. Their single rudder meant that they were not very maneuverable. &quot;Kirov&quot; and &quot;Voroshilov&quot; were fitted with a massive tetrapod foremast, but this proved to restrict the view from the conning tower as well as the fields of fire of the 100Â mm anti-aircraft guns and greatly increased their silhouette. It was reduced to a simple pole mast in the later ships and the superstructure enlarged to accommodate the fire control facilities formerly housed in the foremast.

Shortly after &quot;Kirov&quot; was launched in 1936, the two Project 26bis ships were laid down. They incorporated a number of changes from the first batch, not least of which was that they were larger. They displaced at standard load and at full load. They were only slightly longer at overall and had a deep draft of at full load. On trials they proved to be the fastest ships of the class with a speed of . Their armament was much the same as the earlier ships, although nine  &quot;61-K&quot; anti-aircraft guns were mounted rather than the six on the first pair and they were fitted to carry 150 &quot;Model 1908/39&quot; mines in place of the &quot;Model 1912&quot; mines.

The Project 26bis2 pair were still larger and displaced at standard load, and at full load. They were a tenth of a meter shorter than the Project 26 ships, although the waterline length did not change at all between any of the pairs. Their turbines proved to be slightly more powerful than those of the Project 26bis ships and propelled them at on trials. Production delays with the 100Â mm &quot;B-34&quot; dual-purpose guns forced them to use  &quot;90-K&quot; guns instead and ten  &quot;70-K&quot; anti-aircraft guns supplemented the 45Â mm guns. The mines changed yet again as they could carry 100 &quot;KB&quot; or 106 &quot;Model 1926&quot; mines.

===Armament===
The main armament consisted of three electrically powered MK-3-180 triple turrets with three 57-calibre 180Â mm &quot;B-1-P&quot; guns. The turrets were very small to fit them into the hull space available and were so cramped that their rate of fire was much lower than designed (only two rounds per minute instead of six). The guns were mounted in a single cradle to minimize space and were so close together that their dispersion was very high because the muzzle blast from adjacent guns affected each gun. The turrets weighed approximately , and the guns could be depressed to â4Â° and elevated to 48Â°. The guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this provided a maximum range of around , depending on ammunition and gun type. Normally, 100 rounds per gun were carried, although an additional four rounds per gun could be carried at overload by the Project 26 ships only.

The secondary armament consisted of six single 56-caliber &quot;B-34&quot; anti-aircraft guns with 325 rounds per gun fitted on each side of the rear funnel in all ships except the Project 26bis2 which used eight single 52-caliber &quot;90-K&quot; guns with 300 rounds per gun when the &quot;B-34&quot; program ran into problems. Light AA guns initially consisted of six semi-automatic 45Â mm &quot;21-K&quot; AA guns with 600 rounds per gun and four DK machine guns, with 12,500 rounds per gun, but were significantly increased in service. The Project 26bis ships carried nine &quot;21-K&quot; mounts and the Project 26bis were built with an additional ten fully automatic &quot;70-K&quot; AA guns with a thousand rounds per gun. Over the course of World War II most, if not all, of the 45Â mm guns were replaced by 37Â mm guns and one or two Lend-Lease quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun MK III mounts were fitted to the ships in the Baltic and Black Seas, although each ship varied in its anti-aircraft suite.

Six &quot;39-Yu&quot; torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings; these tubes could be individually adjusted to spread out their salvos. &quot;Molotov&quot; and &quot;Kaganovich&quot; replaced their launchers with the more-modern &quot;1-N&quot; mount during the war. A total of 96 &quot;KB&quot; or 164 &quot;Model 1912&quot; mines could be carried by the first pair of ships. A pair of depth charge racks were mounted as well as four &quot;BMB-1&quot; depth charge throwers. Twenty large &quot;BB-1&quot; and thirty small &quot;BM-1&quot; depth charges were carried although no sonar was fitted for the Project 26 and Project 26bis ships. They did mount the &quot;Arktur&quot; underwater acoustic communication system. &quot;Kalinin&quot; and &quot;Kaganovich&quot; received the Lend-Lease &quot;ASDIC-132&quot; system, which the Soviets called &quot;Drakon-132&quot;, as well as the experimental Soviet &quot;Mars-72&quot; sonar system.

The Project 26 ships were fitted with the &quot;Molniya&quot; fire control system for their main guns which included the &quot;TsAS-2&quot; mechanical computer and the &quot;KDP3-6&quot; director. Each turret and the director had &quot;DM-6&quot; rangefinders which allowed multiple targets to be engaged using a combination of local and central fire control. The four later ships had an improved &quot;Molniya-ATs&quot; fire control system which could accept data from spotter aircraft. The anti-aircraft armament was controlled by the &quot;Gorizont-1&quot; system with a &quot;SO-26&quot; computer, &quot;Gazon&quot; vertical gyroscope and a pair of &quot;SPN-100&quot; directors on each side of the superstructure. Each director had a fully stabilized rangefinder. &quot;Voroshilov&quot; had &quot;SPN-200&quot; directors, but the Project 26bis ships used the &quot;Gorizont-2&quot; system. This had a more advanced &quot;Gorizont-2&quot; computer and &quot;Shar&quot; vertical gyroscope.

The first Soviet ship to carry a radar was &quot;Molotov&quot; which was given a &quot;Redut-K&quot; air warning system in 1940, which she used for the entire war. Lend-Lease radars equipped most of the other ships. The British Types 281, 291 and the American SG radars were used for air search. Main battery fire control radars were the British Types 284 and 285 while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by the Type 282 radar. Soviet-designed &quot;Yupiter-1&quot; and &quot;Mars-1&quot; gunnery radars were fitted in &quot;Molotov&quot; and &quot;Kalinin&quot; by 1944.

===Machinery===
The ships had a twin-shaft-unit machinery layout with alternating boiler rooms and engine rooms. The machinery for &quot;Kirov&quot; was shipped from Italy (being diverted from the contract for the ). The machinery for the rest was built in Kharkiv to Italian plans. The Soviet &quot;TB-7&quot; geared turbines proved to be more powerful and more economical than the originals. &quot;Kirov&quot; burned of fuel oil per unit of horsepower compared to &quot;Kalinin&quot;â³s . Furthermore &quot;Kirov&quot; produced only on trials while &quot;Voroshilov&quot; made and was almost a full knot faster. Six license-built Yarrow-Normand type water-tube boilers powered the turbines with a nominal capacity of 106-tonnes/hour of superheated steam at a pressure of and a temperature of . Each shaft drove a three-bladed bronze propeller for a designed speed of , although this varied from ship to ship. The normal oil capacity was between , but the ships varied widely in the amount of oil carried at full load; this ranged from . Endurance figures also varied widely at full load, from at . The maximum amount of fuel that could be carried ranged from .

===Protection===
The armour scheme formed a raft around the vitals, protected by a waterline belt, deck and traverse bulkheads uniformly in thickness. The turret and barbette armour was also 50Â mm thick. The conning tower sides were with a 100Â mm roof. A box protected the steering gear and a number of control positions were protected against splinters: for the torpedo control station, for main-battery fire control and secondary gun shields, for the secondary-battery control position and the auxiliary command station had sides and roof.

The belt extended or 64.5% of the ship&#x27;s length. Its total height was , of which was below the designed waterline. A double bottom extended past the armored traverse bulkheads and a thin longitudinal bulkhead provided some measure of protection against flooding. It has been judged too thin to withstand a torpedo&#x27;s detonation, but possibly the far-side bulkhead might survive intact, which would cause a list from asymmetrical flooding.

The armor of the Project 26 ships was vulnerable even to destroyer-class weapons at ranges under and the last four ships were given additional armor. The belt, traverse bulkheads, barbettes and turret face thicknesses were all increased to and the box protecting the steering gear was increased to . One oddity of the later ships&#x27; armor scheme was the joint between the armour deck and belt. The top and bottom edges of the belt were tapered, the outer surface angling in from the edge to a thickness of 45Â mm. Similarly the deck edge was also tapered down to about 25Â mm for its outermost 200Â mm. It has been speculated that &quot;This seam in the protection, representing a small target area, may simply have served to save weight and simplify construction.&quot;

===Aircraft===
The &quot;Kirov&quot;s were designed to carry two aircraft, but German catapults had to be imported. Two Heinkel &quot;K-12&quot; catapults were bought in 1937 for &quot;Kirov&quot; and &quot;Voroshilov&quot;. They could traverse 360Â° and launch an aircraft weighing at a speed of , although no suitable aircraft were in service until the KOR-1 seaplane entered service in September 1939. They proved to be unsuitable for rough-weather landings and were disembarked when Operation Barbarossa began. &quot;Gorky&quot; and &quot;Molotov&quot; mounted Soviet-built &quot;ZK-1&quot; catapults of roughly comparable performance, but were destined never to use them for lack of suitable aircraft.

The Project 26 ships landed their catapult during 1941 to make room for more AA guns, as did &quot;Molotov&quot; in 1942. A &quot;ZK-1a&quot; catapult was installed aboard &quot;Molotov&quot; in 1943, and she conducted successful experiments with a catapult-launched Supermarine Spitfire fighter. The Project 26bis2 ships did not receive a catapult until after the end of the war, when a &quot;ZK-2b&quot; was fitted. The catapults, however, were removed from all ships by 1947.

==Construction==
While &quot;Voroshilov&quot; was laid down first, &quot;Kirov&quot; was the prototype for the class and was completed first. Her trials were a disappointment as her Italian-built turbines initially had minor defects, and she was slower than guaranteed. The Italians pointed out that the guarantee only applied if she displaced 7200 tonnes or less, and she was overweight by over . Her turrets had numerous teething problems and inflicted more blast damage than anticipated, which showed that her welding plan had not been followed. Her firing arcs were reduced in an attempt to mitigate the problem. &quot;Voroshilov&quot;â³s Soviet-built turbines were more powerful than anticipated, and she almost achieved her design speed.

Components for the Project 26bis2 ships were manufactured in the West (Ordzhonikidze built those for &quot;Kalinin&quot; and Marti those for &quot;Kaganovich&quot;) and shipped to Komsomolsk-on-Amur for assembly. They were launched from drydocks and towed incomplete to Vladivostok for fitting-out.

==Ships==
==Service==

===World War II===

====Baltic Fleet====
&quot;Kirov&quot; was commissioned into the Baltic Fleet in the autumn of 1938, but was still being worked on into early 1939. She sailed to Riga on 22 October 1940 when the Soviet Union began to occupy Latvia; the following day she sailed for LiepÄja. During the Winter War, &quot;Kirov&quot;, escorted by the destroyers &quot;Smetlivyi&quot; and &quot;Stremitel&#x27;nyi&quot;, attempted to bombard Finnish coast defense guns at RussarÃ¶, south of Hanko. She fired only 35 rounds before she was damaged by a number of near misses and had to return to the Soviet naval base at LiepÄja for repairs. She remained there for the rest of the Winter War and afterwards was under repair at Kronstadt from October 1940 to 21 May 1941.

Both &quot;Kirov&quot; and &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; were transferred to the Gulf of Riga on 14 June 1941, shortly before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. Both cruisers were active in the last days of June covering Soviet defensive mining operations, but &quot;Gorky&quot; and her escorts ran into the German-laid &quot;Apolda&quot; minefield on the 23rd and &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Gnevny&quot; both lost their bows. &quot;Gnevny&quot; sank, while &quot;Gorky&quot; made it to port before being transferred, with assistance, to Tallinn and later to Kronstadt. &quot;Kirov&quot; followed her to Tallinn at the end of the month, after being lightened to pass through the shallows of Moon Sound.

&quot;Gorky&quot; had a new bow section fabricated in Kronstadt and it was mated with the ship on 21 July. &quot;Kirov&quot; provided gunfire support during the defense of Tallinn and served as the flagship of the evacuation fleet from Tallinn to Leningrad at the end of August 1941. For most of the rest of the war both cruisers were blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by Axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the siege of Leningrad and support for the Soviet VyborgâPetrozavodsk Offensive in midâ1944. Both ships were damaged by German air and artillery attacks, but were repaired during the war.

====Black Sea Fleet====
On 23 June 1941, &quot;Voroshilov&quot; covered Soviet destroyers bombarding ConstanÅ£a, but the destroyer leader &quot;Moskva&quot; was sunk by a mine and &quot;Kharkov&quot; was damaged by return fire. She bombarded Axis positions near Odessa in mid-September, but was transferred to Novorossiysk shortly afterwards. On 2 November, she was hit twice in harbor by Junkers Ju 88 bombers of KG 51; one hit started a fire in #3 magazine that was extinguished by water flooding in from the second hit. She had to be towed to Poti for repairs, which lasted until February 1942. She shelled Axis positions near Feodosiya on 2 April 1942, but was damaged by some near misses on 10 April and had to return to Batumi for repairs. In May she supported Soviet troops around Kerch and the Taman Peninsula while helping to transfer the 9th Naval Infantry Brigade from Batumi to Sevastopol. On 29 November 1942, she was damaged by nearby mine explosions while bombarding Feodonisi, but managed to return to Poti under her own power. Just after her repairs were completed she assisted Soviet forces landing behind German lines at the so-called &quot;Malaya Zemlya&quot; at the end of January 1943. The loss of three destroyers to German aircraft attempting to interdict the German evacuation of the Taman Bridgehead on 6 October 1943 caused Stalin to forbid the deployment of large naval units without his express permission and this meant the end of &quot;Voroshilov&quot;â³s active participation in the war.

&quot;Molotov&quot; was commissioned just before the German invasion and spent most of 1941 moving from port to port to take advantage of her air warning radar, the first fitted in the Soviet Navy. She bombarded Axis positions near Feodosiya in early November and was sent to reinforce Sevastopol with elements of the 386th Rifle Division from Poti. Damaged by a number of shell hits while off-loading troops on 29 December, she was still able to take 600 wounded when she departed. She reprised her role as a transport during the first week of January. Her bow was damaged during a heavy storm in Tuapse when it was thrown against the jetty on 21â22 January 1942. She spent most of the next month under repair, although her bow could not be straightened which reduced her speed by several knots. After making a number of bombardment sorties in support of Soviet troops on the Kerch Peninsula, she returned to Poti for more permanent repairs on 20 March. In June she made a number of transport runs in support of the garrison of Sevastopol. On 2 August her stern was blown off by torpedo bombers acting in concert with Italian MAS torpedo boats. The damage reduced her speed to and she had to be steered by her engines. She was under repair at Poti until 31 July 1943, using the stern of the incomplete &quot;Frunze&quot;, the rudder of the incomplete cruiser &quot;Zheleznyakov&quot;, the steering gear from &quot;Kaganovich&quot; and the steering sensor from the submarine &quot;L-25&quot;. She saw no action after completing her repairs due to Stalin&#x27;s order.

====Pacific Fleet====

Even though &quot;Lazar Kaganovich&quot; and &quot;Kalinin&quot; were both commissioned before the end of the war, they saw no action during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945; in any event, &quot;Lazar Kaganovich&quot; was not fully completed until 29 January 1947.

===Postwar careers===
&quot;Kirov&quot; was damaged by a German magnetic mine while leaving Kronstadt on 17 October 1945. She was under repair until 20 December 1946. Refitted from November 1949 to April 1953, her machinery was completely overhauled, with her radars, fire control systems and anti-aircraft guns being replaced by the latest Soviet systems. She was reclassified as a training cruiser on 2 August 1961, regularly visited Poland and East Germany, and was sold for scrap on 22 February 1974. Two of her gun turrets were installed at Saint Petersburg as a monument. &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; tested the first Soviet naval helicopter, the Kamov Ka-10, in December 1950 and began her refit in mid-1953. This was planned much like &quot;Kirov&quot;â³s refit, although her displacement was to increase from torpedo bulges, with consequent penalties to her speed and range. The Navy reevaluated the scope of the work in 1955, deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship, and suspended the refit. &quot;Gorky&quot; was sold for scrap on 18 April 1959 after it was decided that she was not required as a missile test ship.

&quot;Voroshilov&quot; began her postwar modernization in April 1954, but encountered the same issues as &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot;. Unlike her half-sister, she was selected for conversion as a testbed for missile development as Project 33 on 17 February 1956. The conversion process was quite prolonged, as her armament was removed and she received an entirely new superstructure and masts; and she was not recommissioned as &quot;OS-24&quot; until 31 December 1961. She was modernized under Project 33M from 11 October 1963 to 1 December 1965. Converted to a floating barracks on 6 October 1972, she was briefly redesignated as &quot;PKZ-19&quot; before being sold for scrap on 2 March 1973. &quot;Voroshilov&quot;â³s 14-ton propeller and 2.5-ton stop anchor are on display at the Museum of Heroic Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol on Sapun Mountain in Sevastopol.

&quot;Molotov&quot; suffered a fire in the #2 turret handling room on 5 October 1946 which required the magazine to be flooded; 22 sailors were killed and 20 wounded. She was used as a testbed for the new radars intended for the &quot;Chapayev&quot; and cruisers in the late 1940s. Modernized like her half-sister &quot;Kirov&quot; between 1952 and 29 October 1955, she was renamed &quot;Slava&quot; on 3 August 1957 after Vyacheslav Molotov fell out of favor with Nikita Khrushchev. She was reclassified as a training cruiser on 3 August 1961 and deployed to the Mediterranean during 5â30 June 1967 to show Soviet support for Syria during the Six-Day War. She returned to the Mediterranean between September and December 1970 where she assisted the &quot;Bravyi&quot; after the latter&#x27;s collision with the aircraft carrier on 9 November 1970. She was sold for scrap on 4 April 1972.

&quot;Kalinin&quot; was placed in reserve on 1 May 1956, and was restored to the Navy List on 1 December 1957 before being disarmed and converted into a floating barracks on 6 February 1960. She was sold for scrap on 12 April 1963. &quot;Kaganovich&quot; was renamed &quot;Lazar Kaganovich&quot; on 3 August 1945 to distinguish her from Lazar&#x27;s disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich. She was renamed &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; on 3 August 1957 after Lazar Kaganovich was purged from the government after an unsuccessful coup against Nikita Khrushchev that same year. Her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon on 19 September 1957 and she was deemed uneconomical to repair and sold for scrap on 6 February 1960.

<text>Andrew Ferguson Neil (born 21 May 1949) is a British journalist and broadcaster. He was editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; from 1983 to 1994. He has presented various political programmes on the BBC and on Channel 4. Born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Neil attended Paisley Grammar School, before studying at the University of Glasgow. He entered journalism in 1973 as a correspondent for &quot;The Economist&quot;.

Neil was appointed editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; by Rupert Murdoch in 1983, and held this position until 1994. After this, he became a contributor to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. He was chief executive and editor-in-chief of Press Holdings Media Group. In 1988, he became founding chairman of Sky TV, also part of Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation. He worked for the BBC for 25 years until 2020, fronting various programmes, including &quot;Sunday Politics&quot; and &quot;This Week&quot; on BBC One and &quot;Daily Politics&quot;, &quot;Politics Live&quot; and &quot;The Andrew Neil Show&quot; on BBC Two. From 2008 until 2024 he was the chairman of Press Holdings, whose titles include &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and ITP Media Group. Following his departure from the BBC, he became founding chairman of GB News and a presenter on the channel, but resigned in September 2021. He later joined Channel 4 in 2022 as presenter of &quot;The Andrew Neil Show&quot;, which shared the same name as his former BBC Two programme. In June 2024 he additionally began hosting a daily broadcast for Times Radio providing political analysis, commentary, interviews and debates.

==Early life==
Neil was born on 21 May 1949 in Paisley, Renfrewshire, to Mary and James Neil. His mother worked in cotton mills during World War II and his father ran the wartime Cairo fire brigade, worked as an electrician and was a major in the Territorial Army in Renfrewshire. He grew up in the Glenburn area and attended the local Langcraigs Primary School. At 11, Neil passed the qualifying examination and obtained entrance to the selective Paisley Grammar School.

After school, Neil attended the University of Glasgow, where he edited the student newspaper, the &quot;Glasgow University Guardian&quot;, and dabbled in student television. He was a member of the Dialectic Society and the Conservative Club, and participated in Glasgow University Union inter-varsity debates. In 1971, he was chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students. He graduated in 1971, with an MA with honours in political economy and political science. He had been tutored by Vince Cable and had a focus on American history.

==Press career==
After his graduation, Neil briefly worked as a sports correspondent for a local newspaper, the &quot;Paisley Daily Express&quot;, before working for the Conservative Party. In 1973, he joined &quot;The Economist&quot; as a correspondent and was later promoted as editor of the publication&#x27;s section on Britain.

===&quot;The Sunday Times&quot;===
Neil was editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; from 1983 to 1994. His hiring was controversial: it was argued he was appointed by Rupert Murdoch over more experienced colleagues, such as Hugo Young and Brian MacArthur.

Neil told Murdoch before he was appointed editor that &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; was intellectually stuck in a 1960s time warp and that it needed to &quot;shake off its collectivist mind-set to become the champion of a market-led revolution that would shake the British Establishment to its bones and transform the economy and society&quot;. Neil later said that although he shared some of Murdoch&#x27;s right-wing views, &quot;on many matters Rupert was well to the right of me politically. He was a monetarist. I was not. Nor did I share his conservative social outlook&quot;. 

In his first editorial, on 9 October 1983, Neil advised Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government to &quot;move to the right on industrial policy (trust-bust, deregulate, privatise wherever it produces more competition and efficiency) and centre-left in economic strategy (a few billion extra in capital spending would have little impact on interest rates or inflation but could give a lift to a shaky economic recovery)&quot;.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; strongly supported the stationing of American cruise missiles in bases in Britain after the Soviet Union installed SS-20s in Eastern Europe, and it criticised the resurgent Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Neil also wrote editorials supporting the United States invasion of Grenada because it would restore democracy there, despite opposition from Hugo Young. Neil replied to Young that he wanted the editorial stance of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to be &quot;neo-Keynesian in economic policy, radical right in industrial policy, liberal on social matters and European and Atlanticist on foreign policy&quot;. 

In Neil&#x27;s first year as the paper&#x27;s editor, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; had revealed the date of the deployment of cruise missiles, exposed how Mark Thatcher had channelled the gains from his consultancy business into a bank account and reported on Robert Mugabe&#x27;s atrocities in Matabeleland. Neil also printed extracts from Germaine Greer&#x27;s &quot;Sex and Destiny&quot; and from Francis Pym&#x27;s anti-Thatcher autobiography, as well as a study of the &quot;Patels of Britain&quot;, a celebration of the success of Britain&#x27;s Asian community.

Neil regards the newspaper&#x27;s revelation of details of Israel&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme in 1986, by using photographs and testimony from former Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu, as his greatest scoop as an editor. During his editorship, the newspaper lost a libel case over claims that it had made concerning a witness, Carmen Proetta, who was interviewed after her appearance in the &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; documentary on the Gibraltar shootings. One of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; journalists involved, Rosie Waterhouse, resigned not long afterwards.

On 20 July 1986, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; printed a front-page article (titled &#x27;Queen dismayed by &quot;uncaring&quot; Thatcher&#x27;) alleging that the Queen believed that Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s policies were &quot;uncaring, confrontational and socially divisive&quot;. The main source of information was the Queen&#x27;s press secretary, Michael Shea. When Buckingham Palace issued a statement rebutting the story, Neil was so angry at what he considered to be the Palace&#x27;s double-dealing that he refused to print the statement in later editions of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

In 1987, the Labour-controlled Strathclyde Regional Authority wanted to close down Neil&#x27;s old school, Paisley Grammar School. After finding the secretary of state for Scotland, Malcolm Rifkind, indifferent to the school&#x27;s future, Neil contacted Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s policy adviser, Brian Griffiths, to try and save the school. When Griffiths informed Thatcher of Strathclyde&#x27;s plan to close it she issued a new regulation that gave the Scottish secretary the power to save schools where 80 per cent of the parents were opposed to the local authority&#x27;s closure plan, thereby saving Paisley Grammar.

While at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1988, Neil met the former Miss India, Pamella Bordes, in a nightclub, an inappropriate place for someone with Neil&#x27;s job according to Peregrine Worsthorne. The &quot;News of the World&quot; suggested Bordes was a call girl. Worsthorne argued in an editorial article &quot;Playboys as Editors&quot; in March 1989 for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; that Neil was not fit to edit a serious Sunday newspaper. Worsthorne effectively accused Neil of knowing that Bordes was a prostitute. He apparently did not know about Bordes, which the &quot;Telegraph&quot; had accepted by the time the libel case came to High Court of Justice in January 1990, but the paper still defended their coverage as fair comment. Neil won both the case and Â£1,000 in damages plus costs.

In a July 1988 editorial (&quot;Morals for the majority&quot;) Neil said that in Britain there were emerging pockets of social decay and unsocial behaviour: &quot;a social rot...has gone deeper than the industrial decay of the 1960s and 1970s&quot;. Having been impressed with Charles Murray&#x27;s study of the American welfare state, &quot;Losing Ground&quot;, Neil invited Murray to Britain in 1989 to study Britain&#x27;s emerging underclass. &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; of 26 November 1989 was largely devoted to Murray&#x27;s report, which found that the British underclass consisted of people existing on welfare, the black economy and crime, with illegitimacy being the single most reliable predictor. The accompanying editorial said Britain was in the midst of a &quot;social tragedy of Dickensian proportions&quot;, with an underclass &quot;characterized by drugs, casual violence, petty crime, illegitimate children, homelessness, work avoidance and contempt for conventional values&quot;.

Under Neil&#x27;s editorship, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; opposed the poll tax. In his memoirs, Neil said that his opposition to the poll tax crystallised when he discovered that his cleaner would be paying more poll tax than himself at a time when his income tax had just been reduced to 40% from 60%. During the 1990 Conservative Party leadership election, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; was the only Murdoch-owned newspaper to support Michael Heseltine against Thatcher. Neil blamed Thatcher for high inflation, &quot;misplaced chauvinism&quot; over Europe, and the poll tax, concluding that she had become an &quot;electoral liability&quot; and must therefore be replaced by Heseltine.

In an editorial of January 1988 (&quot;Modernize the monarchy&quot;), Neil advocated the abolition of both the preference for males in the law of succession and of the exclusion of Catholics from the throne. Subsequent editorials of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called for the Queen to pay income tax and advocated a scaled-down monarchy that would not be class-based but which would be &quot;an institution with close links to all classes. That meant clearing out the old-school courtiers...and creating a court which was far more representative of the multi-racial meritocracy that Britain was becoming&quot;. In an editorial of February 1991 Neil criticised some minor members of the Royal Family for their behaviour while the country was at war in the Gulf. In 1992 Neil obtained for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; the serialisation rights for Andrew Morton&#x27;s book &quot;Diana: Her True Story&quot;, which revealed the breakdown of Princess Diana&#x27;s marriage as well as her bulimia and her suicide attempts.

In 1992 Neil was criticised by anti-Nazi groups and historians like Hugh Trevor-Roper for employing the Holocaust denier David Irving to translate the diaries of Joseph Goebbels.

===End of the Murdoch connection===
According to Neil, he was replaced as &quot;Sunday Times&quot; editor in 1994 because Murdoch had become envious of his celebrity. Many years later, in November 2017, former Conservative cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke said Neil had been removed because Neil&#x27;s article about corruption in the Malaysian government of Mahathir Mohamad conflicted with Murdoch&#x27;s desire to acquire a television franchise in the country. The Malaysian prime minister at the time told Clarke on a ministerial visit that he had achieved Neil&#x27;s sacking after a telephone conversation with Murdoch. The conflict between Neil and Mohamad did become public knowledge at the time. The British minister of state for trade Richard Needham criticised Neil and the newspaper for potentially putting thousands of jobs at risk.

Neil&#x27;s departure from his role as &quot;Sunday Times&quot; editor was officially reported in 1994 as being merely temporary, as he was to present and edit a current affairs programme for Fox in New York. &quot;During my time, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; has been at the centre of every major controversy in Britain&quot;, he said at the time. &quot;These are the kind of journalistic values I want to reproduce at Fox&quot;. Neil&#x27;s new television programme did not make it to air. A pilot produced in September had a mixed internal response, and Murdoch cancelled the entire project in late October. Neil did not return to his job as &quot;Sunday Times&quot; editor.

===Post-News Corp career===
Neil became a contributor to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. In 1996, he became editor-in-chief of the Barclay brothers&#x27; Press Holdings group of newspapers, owner of &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, &quot;Sunday Business&quot; (later just &quot;The Business&quot;) and &quot;The European&quot;. Press Holdings sold &quot;The Scotsman&quot; in December 2005, ending Neil&#x27;s relationship with the newspaper. Neil has not enjoyed great success with the circulations of the newspapers (indeed &quot;The European&quot; folded shortly after he took over). &quot;The Business&quot; closed down in February 2008. He exchanged his role as chief executive of Press Holdings for chairman in July 2008. He is chairman of the Press Holdings title &quot;The Spectator&quot;. In January 2024, Neil told BBC Newsnight that he would quit his role as chairman of &quot;The Spectator&quot; if a UAE-US consortium is successful in its proposed takeover of the magazine and its sister publication &quot;the Daily Telegraph.&quot; In September 2024, following the acquisition of &quot;The Spectator&quot; by Paul Marshall, he resigned as chairman.

Since 2006 Neil has been chair of the Dubai-based publishing company ITP Media Group.

In June 2008, Neil led a consortium which bought talent agency Peters, Fraser &amp; Dunlop (PFD) from CSS Stellar plc for Â£4Â million, making him chairman of the new company in addition to his other activities. Neil served as Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews from 1999 to 2002.

==Broadcasting career==
As well as Neil&#x27;s newspaper activities he has maintained a television career. While he worked for &quot;The Economist&quot;, he provided news reports to American networks.

His regular interview series for Channel 4, &quot;Is This Your Life?&quot; (made by Open Media), was nominated for a BAFTA award for &quot;Best Talk Show&quot;. In the course of the series Neil interviewed a wide variety of personalities, from Albert Reynolds and Morris Cerullo to Jimmy Savile and Max Clifford. He acted as a television newsreader in two films: &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; (1993) and &quot;Parting Shots&quot; (1999), both directed by Michael Winner.

===Sky===

In 1988 he became founding chairman of Sky TV, also part of Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation. Neil was instrumental in the company&#x27;s launch, overseeing the transformation of a downmarket, single-channel satellite service into a four-channel network in less than a year. Neil and Murdoch stood side by side at Sky&#x27;s new headquarters in Isleworth on 5 February 1989 to witness the launch of the service. Sky was not an instant success; the uncertainty caused by the competition provided by British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) and the initial shortage of satellite dishes were early problems.

The failure of BSB in November 1990 led to a merger, but a few programmes acquired by BSB were screened on Sky One and BSB&#x27;s satellites were sold. The new company was called British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). The merger may have saved Sky financially; despite its popularity, Sky had very few major advertisers to begin with, and it was beginning to suffer from embarrassing breakdowns. Acquiring BSB&#x27;s healthier advertising contracts and equipment apparently solved the problems. BSkyB would not make a profit for a decade but by July 2010, it was one of the most profitable television companies in Europe.

===BBC===
At &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, he contributed to BBC, both radio and television. He commented on the various controversies provoked by the paper while he was editor. During the 1990s, Neil fronted political programmes for the BBC, including &quot;Despatch Box&quot; on BBC Two.
Following the revamp of the BBC&#x27;s political programming in early 2003, Neil presented the live political programmes, &quot;This Week&quot; on BBC One and &quot;Daily Politics&quot; on BBC Two. The latter ended in 2018 and was replaced by &quot;Politics Live&quot;, which Neil presented until he left the corporation.

From 2007 to 2010, he presented the weekly one-on-one political interview programme &quot;Straight Talk with Andrew Neil&quot; on the BBC News channel. He also presented &quot;Sunday Politics&quot; on BBC One between 2012 and 2017 and occasionally guest presented &quot;Newsnight&quot; on BBC Two following host Jeremy Paxman&#x27;s departure in 2014.

During the BBC&#x27;s general election night coverage in 2010, Neil interviewed various celebrities on the River Thames. In the 2015 election, Neil interviewed political figures in the BBC studio. He also provided commentary on foreign elections, and with Katty Kay led the BBC&#x27;s overnight live coverage of the US presidential election in 2016. In the run-up to the 2017 general election he interviewed five of the political party leaders on BBC One in &quot;The Andrew Neil Interviews&quot;.

Neil earned Â£200,000 to Â£249,999 as a BBC presenter in the financial year 2016â17.

In May 2019, Neil interviewed Ben Shapiro, an American conservative commentator, on &quot;Politics Live&quot; on BBC Two. Shapiro was promoting his new book, &quot;The Right Side of History&quot;, which discusses Judeo-Christian values and asserts their decline in the United States. Shapiro took offence to the questioning, accused Neil of having a left-leaning bias, and said Neil was trying to make a &quot;quick buck... off of the fact that I&#x27;m popular and no one has ever heard of you&quot;, before Shapiro ended the interview. Shapiro later apologised for the incident.

During the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election, Neil interviewed candidates Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson, in &quot;The Andrew Neil Interviews.&quot; Director of BBC News Fran Unsworth hailed it as &quot;a masterclass of political interviewing&quot;.

In August 2019, the BBC announced that Neil would host a prime-time political programme that would run through autumn 2019 on BBC Two, called &quot;The Andrew Neil Show&quot;. The show included &quot;in-depth analysis and forensic questioning of key political players&quot;. It was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and then cancelled as the BBC went through with budget cuts.

On 24 September 2019, Neil presented a live programme on BBC One entitled &quot;BBC News Special: Politics in Crisis&quot;, addressing the Supreme Court judgement which deemed Boris Johnson&#x27;s prorogation of parliament unlawful. In the run-up to the 2019 general election, Neil interviewed all the leaders of the main political parties, excluding Johnson, having delivered a monologue in &quot;The Andrew Neil Interviews&quot; issuing him a challenge to participate.

On 15 July 2020 the BBC announced that Neil was in talks about an interview show on BBC One. The next month he was discussed in the media as Sir David Clementi&#x27;s possible successor as chairman of the BBC; he later said he had no interest in the role. The Director-General of the BBC, Tim Davie, on his second day in the role, held talks with Neil &quot;in an attempt to get him back to the BBC&quot; and it was reported that he was also in discussions with executives from commercial rivals.

Neil&#x27;s final appearance for the BBC was when he presented coverage of the 2020 US presidential election, again with Katty Kay.

===GB News===
On 25 September 2020, Neil announced his exit from the BBC to become chairman of GB News, a news channel launched on 13 June 2021. As well as being chairman, he presented &quot;Andrew Neil&quot;, a prime time evening programme on the channel. Two weeks after the channel&#x27;s launch, after having hosted eight episodes of his show, he announced he would be taking a break. He spent months in his hiatus involved in legal disputes with GB News over ending his contract. However, Neil and the channel publicly maintained that he was taking a holiday, and he was expected to rejoin the channel in early September. As that time approached, multiple news sources reported that his return had been postponed, with some speculating that this postponement might become indefinite. It was further reported that he was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; to return to the channel.

On 13 September 2021, Neil resigned from GB News as chairman and lead presenter and announced he would enter a new role as a guest contributor. Later that month, on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;, he said that he had left his roles at GB News over the direction the channel was taking, and that he had become a &quot;minority of one&quot; within senior management. It was reported that these remarks had angered GB News bosses and that Neil would not be appearing on GB News again. On 22 September, Neil said he would not return to GB News.

Neil later described his decision to lead the channel as the &quot;single biggest mistake&quot; of his career, comparing the channel to Fox News.

===Return to Channel 4===
In January 2022, it was reported that Neil was in talks with Channel 4 about presenting a weekly politics show to be launched later in 2022. On 30 January, Channel 4 aired a documentary, &quot;Boris Johnson: Has He Run Out of Road?&quot;, in which Neil explored the future of Boris Johnson&#x27;s premiership following repeated allegations of parties held in Downing Street during the COVID-19 lockdown. On 21 February, Channel 4 announced he would host a show beginning in May, which would also be accompanied by a weekly podcast. &quot;The Andrew Neil Show&quot; launched with an interview with cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, and Neil was also joined by journalists Pippa Crerar and Madeline Grant.

===Times Radio===
Since May 2024, Andrew Neil hosts a daily-scheduled lunchtime show on Times Radio, from 1pm to 2pm, in which he provides commentaries and in-depth analysis on current domestic and international affairs, joined by Times journalists, other press columnists or political guests.

== Political positions ==

===War in Afghanistan===
Neil was a vocal and enthusiastic proponent of British military involvement in Afghanistan. Neil derided those who opposed the war as &quot;wimps with no will to fight&quot;, while labelling &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;The Daily Terrorist&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as the &quot;New Taliban&quot; for publishing dissenting opinions about the wisdom of British military involvement. For questioning whether &quot;Bush and Blair are leading us deeper and deeper into a quagmire&quot;, Neil ridiculed &quot;Daily Mail&quot; columnist Stephen Glover, calling him &quot;woolly, wimpy&quot; and &quot;juvenile&quot;. He compared Tony Blair to Winston Churchill and Osama bin Laden to Adolf Hitler, while describing the United States invasion of Afghanistan as a &quot;calibrated response&quot; and a &quot;patient, precise and successful deployment of US military power&quot;.

===War in Iraq===
Neil was an early advocate of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, describing the case for war and regime change advanced by Tony Blair and George W. Bush as &quot;convincing&quot; and &quot;masterful&quot;. In 2002, Neil wrote that Iraq had &quot;embarked on a worldwide shopping spree to buy the technology and material needed to construct weapons of mass destruction â and the missile systems needed to deliver them across great distances&quot;, and that &quot;the suburbs of Baghdad are now dotted with secret installations, often posing as hospitals or schools, developing missile fuel, bodies and guidance systems, chemical and biological warheads and, most sinister of all, a renewed attempt to develop nuclear weapons.&quot; He wrote that Saddam Hussein would provide Al-Qaeda with weapons of mass destruction, and that Saddam had links to the September 11 attacks.

===Climate change===
Neil has been accused of rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change and was criticised for frequently inviting non-scientists and climate change deniers to deny climate change on his BBC programmes. In 2012, Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, said that Neil had &quot;rarely, if ever, included a climate scientist in any of its debates about global warming&quot; on his BBC programme &quot;Daily Politics&quot;. Ward wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2011 that Neil let inaccurate and misleading statements about climate change go unchallenged on &quot;Daily Politics&quot;. 

In November 2020, Neil said that climate change was real and needed to be confronted. He criticised protests by Extinction Rebellion on Remembrance Day, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve interviewed Extinction Rebellion on several occasions and most of what they say is total nonsense or total exaggeration.&quot;

===HIV/AIDS===
During Neil&#x27;s time as editor, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; backed a campaign to falsely claim that HIV was not a cause of AIDS. In 1990, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; serialised a book by an American right-winger who rejected the scientific consensus on the causes of AIDS, and who falsely claimed that AIDS could not spread to heterosexuals. Articles and editorials in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; cast doubt on the scientific consensus, described HIV as a &quot;politically correct virus&quot; about which there was a &quot;conspiracy of silence,&quot; disputed that AIDS was spreading in Africa, claimed that tests for HIV were invalid, described the HIV/AIDS treatment drug azidothymidine (AZT) as harmful, and characterised the World Health Organization (WHO) as an &quot;Empire-building AIDS [organisation].&quot;

The pseudoscientific coverage of HIV/AIDS in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; led the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; to monitor the newspaper&#x27;s coverage and to publish letters rebutting the falsehoods printed in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. In response to this, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; published an article headlined &quot;AIDS â why we won&#x27;t be silenced&quot;, which said that &quot;Nature&quot; engaged in censorship and &quot;sinister intent&quot;. In his 1996 book, &quot;Full Disclosure&quot;, Neil wrote that his HIV/AIDS denialism &quot;deserved publication to encourage debate.&quot; That same year, he wrote that &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; had been vindicated in its coverage, &quot;The Sunday Times was one of a handful of newspapers, perhaps the most prominent, which argued that heterosexual Aids was a myth. The figures are now in and this newspaper stands totally vindicated... The history of Aids is one of the great scandals of our time. I do not blame doctors and the Aids lobby for warning that everybody might be at risk in the early days, when ignorance was rife and reliable evidence scant.&quot; He criticised the &quot;AIDS establishment&quot; and said &quot;Aids had become an industry, a job-creation scheme for the caring classes.&quot;

In a 2021 interview Neil said that he now regretted certain aspects of the paper&#x27;s coverage of HIV and AIDS, but he was unwilling or unable to accept any personal responsibility for the falsehoods published while he was editor. Neil chose instead to blame an employee, stating that he had placed faith in a trusted correspondent who was found to be wrong.

===Republicanism===
In January 1997, ITV broadcast a live television debate &quot;Monarchy: The Nation Decides&quot;, in which Neil spoke in favour of establishing a republic. When asked in 2021 by the BBC if he was still a republican, he changed his mind, saying &quot;Not really.&quot;

==&quot;Private Eye&quot;==
The British satirical and investigative journalism magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; has referred to Neil by the nickname &quot;Brillo&quot; after his wiry hair, which is seen as bearing a resemblance to a Brillo Pad, a brand of scouring pad.

In a long-running joke, a photograph of Neil wearing a vest and baseball cap in an embrace with a much younger woman (often mistaken for Pamella Bordes, a former &quot;Miss India&quot;, but really an African American make-up artist with whom Neil was once involved) appeared regularly in the letters page of the magazine for some years, and is still used occasionally. Typically, a reader will ask the editor if he has any photographs relevant to some topical news item, frequently with a veiled allusion to the age-gap between two individuals, or to ethnic diversity. By double entendre, the letter can be construed as a request for this photo, which is duly published alongside. Neil claims to find it &quot;fascinating&quot; and an example of &quot;public school racism&quot; on the part of the magazine&#x27;s editorial staff.

==Personal life==
Neil lives in Grasse in the south of France and also has homes in Chelsea, London and Midtown Manhattan, New York City, an apartment within the Trump World Tower. Neil married Susan Nilsson, a Swedish communications director, on 8 August 2015.

Neil has threatened to sue American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri over claims she made on Twitter linking Neil to the billionaire and child sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein, as well as other Twitter users who retweeted or endorsed her now-deleted tweet. Neil denies ever meeting Epstein and argues he was put in his infamous &quot;black book&quot; by Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein&#x27;s procurer.

After watching &quot;Gomorrah&quot;, Neil developed an interest in Italian rap music, calling it &quot;the best rap music there is.&quot;

<text>In his work on set theory, Georg Cantor denoted the collection of all cardinal numbers by the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet,  (transliterated as Tav, Taw, or Sav.) As Cantor realized, this collection could not itself have a cardinality, as this would lead to a paradox of the Burali-Forti type. Cantor instead said that it was an &quot;inconsistent&quot; collection which was absolutely infinite.

<doc id="640486" wikidata="Q5249791" url="?curid=640486" title="Dedicated (Lemar album)">
<text>Dedicated is the debut album by English singer Lemar. It was released on 24 November 2003 by RCA Records. The now defunct girl group The 411 provided backing vocals for a number of tracks.

==Background==
Sony Music signed Lemar to a five-record deal after his success on the BBC Television programme &quot;Fame Academy&quot; in 2002. His first single &quot;Dance (with U)&quot; was written with Craig Hardy and Fitzgerald Scott who had previously worked with Keith Sweat. The second single &quot;50/50&quot; was recorded by the Norwegian Stargate production team. Fingaz, who has produced hits by British group Big Brovaz, also produced the song &quot;What About Love&quot;. Lemar also recorded a version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; by Al Green which was one of his featured songs by &quot;Fame Academy&quot;.

==Critical reception==

BBC Music critic Karen Goodchild called &quot;Dedicated&quot; &quot;a great album that is packed full of potential hits that showcase Lemar&#x27;s amazing vocal ability. That, coupled with the fact that Lemar co-wrote several of these tracks, will surely mean that he&#x27;ll be around a lot longer than the other over-hyped reality TV stars.&quot; Caroline Sullivan from &quot;The Guardian&quot; found that &quot;Dedicated&quot; presented Lemar &quot;as North London&#x27;s answer to Luther Vandross: a romantic of the old school who sells a song with understated sleekness and a hint of chest fur. The contents are all Obika co-writes save for a hip-hoppety version of Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together;&quot; the mid-tempo boudoir grooves hardly do justice to the voice, but at least lay the foundations for what could be a substantial future.&quot; AllMusic rated the album three stars out of five.

==Commercial performance==
The first single from the album, &quot;Dance With U&quot;, reached number 2 on the UK singles charts in early 2003. His first album &quot;Dedicated&quot; was released late in 2003 with additional singles &quot;50/50&quot; and &quot;Another Day&quot; also achieving chart success in the UK. Following the success of the album, he commenced his first headlining tour of the UK. &quot;Dedicated&quot; was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales in excess of 300,000 copies.

<text>Michael Wilding (born 1942) is a British-born writer and academic who has spent most of his career at the University of Sydney, where he has been an emeritus professor in English and Australian literature since 2002.

== Early life and education==
Michael Wilding was born in 1942 in Worcester, England, and read English at Oxford University, where he graduated in 1963 with BA with first-class honours.

==Academic career==

Wilding took up an appointment as assistant lecturer at the University of Sydney in 1963, where he stayed for three years. He returned to England in 1967, where he attained his M.A., and took up a lectureship at the University of Birmingham.

In 1969 he took up a post as senior lecturer at Sydney University, then becoming Reader in English from 1973 to 1992. He received the degree of D. Litt. from the University of Sydney in 1993. In 1993 he was appointed Professor of English and Australian Literature at Sydney, a position he held until his retirement in 2000, after which he was made professor emeritus.

His scholarly work focused especially on 17th-century and early 18th-century English literature, such as by the poet John Milton, and Australian literature such as by Marcus Clarke, William Lane, Christina Stead).

==Writing career==
He was a creative writer in the &quot;new writing&quot; movement, whose members were influential in revitalising Australian literature. His work was later described as &quot;exciting and innovative&quot; by Ross Fitzgerald in &quot;The Australian&quot;.

He has published many novels and short story collections, and has had his stories published widely in anthologies. His most widely referenced work has been the short story magazine, &quot;Tabloid Story&quot;, which he co-founded with Frank Moorhouse and Carmel Kelly in 1972 and which ran for 33 issues, until 1974.

<text>The Sowerby family () was a British family of several generations of naturalists, illustrators, botanists, and zoologists active from the late 18th century to the mid twentieth century.

*James Sowerby (1757â1822)
**James De Carle Sowerby (1787â1871)
***James Sowerby (1815â1834)
***William Sowerby (1827â1906)
***Joseph Sowerby (1829âca.1871)
****Rev. Arthur Sowerby (1857â?)
*****Arthur de Carle Sowerby (1885â1954)
**George Brettingham Sowerby I (1788â1854)
***George Brettingham Sowerby II (1812â1884)
***Charlotte Caroline Sowerby (1820â1865)
****George Brettingham Sowerby III (1843â1921)
**Charles Edward Sowerby (1795â1842)
***John Edward Sowerby (1825-1870)

The three George Sowerbys produced major works on molluscs and their systematics. Together, they introduced numerous (sometimes the number 5000 is mentioned) taxonomic names. Because all three of the G.B Sowerbys published extensively on the subject of conchology, it is not easy even for professional taxonomists to unravel which of the three &quot;G.B. Sowerbys&quot; is meant in a particular citation when the numbering system G.B. Sowerby I, II, or III is not used. Even when a date is provided, this kind of attribution is not obvious: e.g. &quot;Sowerby, 1870&quot; can refer to either G.B. Sowerby II or G.B. Sowerby III.

The scientific and artistic contributions of the family extended well into the 20th century. Arthur de Carle Sowerby (1885â1954), James Sowerby&#x27;s great-great-grandson, explored the geography and natural history of China. One of James&#x27; grandsons, John George Sowerby (1850â1914), was an illustrator and glass-worker whose work was exhibited in the British Royal Academy, and who directed Ellison Glass Works Ltd, which during the 1880s was the world&#x27;s largest producer of pressed glass. John G. Sowerby&#x27;s daughter Katherine Githa (1876â1970) became a noted playwright, and Millicent Sowerby (1878â1967) was a painter and illustrator known for her children&#x27;s book illustrations.

==Public higher education institutions==
There are 125 public higher education institutions divided into 63 public universities, 13 Institutes, 44 Polytechnics, and 5 Community Colleges. Public universities in Indonesia are the major component of Indonesia&#x27;s higher education system. Public universities and higher education institutions are generally sought after by students and seen as more prestigious than private ones. Indonesian students from all over the country applied to the public universities, colleges, institutes, academies, and polytechnics through several different means of applications or exams. The first means to apply in public universities in Indonesia are SNBP and SNBT. SNBP is short for &quot;Seleksi Nasional Berdasarkan Prestasi&quot; or &quot;National Selection Based on Achievements&quot;, which is based on school grades and achievements of the student and without exam. Meanwhile, SNBT is short for &quot;Seleksi Nasional Berdasarkan Tes&quot; or &quot;National Selection Based on Test&quot;, which is based on scores of a unified nation-wide entrance exam. These two national selections were formerly called SNMPTN (Indonesian: &quot;Seleksi Nasional Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri&quot;) and SBMPTN (Indonesian: &quot;Seleksi Bersama Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri&quot;). There are also another national entrance exams such as, SBMPN (Indonesian: &quot;Seleksi Bersama Masuk Politeknik Negeri&quot;) for state polytechnics, SPAN (Indonesian: &quot;Seleksi Perguruan Tinggi Agama Negeri&quot;) for religious universities or colleges which is divided into SPAN-PTKIN for state-owned Islamic colleges and Selnas-PTKKN for state-owned Christian colleges. Other than nation-wide exams or selections, each universities also held their own entrance exams as separate means to apply to the university through their own localized exam.

<text>The Stansted Express is a direct train service linking London Liverpool Street to London Stansted Airport. It is a sub-brand of Greater Anglia, the current franchise operator of the East Anglia franchise.

==History==

In 1986, British Rail (BR) extended the electrification of the West Anglia Main Line from Bishop&#x27;s Stortford to Cambridge. Included in this plan was the construction of a new branch lineâdiverging from a triangular junction at Stansted Mountfitchetâto serve , at which a new terminal was to open in 1991 providing for a large expansion in scheduled aviation passenger services. Therefore, BR decided to build a dedicated fleet of units to work the new Stansted Express service, designated as Class 322, with the service operated by the Network SouthEast sector.

Upon the privatisation of British Rail in 1996, the Stansted Express was part of West Anglia Great Northern franchise until the tender was reorganised in 2004, at which time it became part of the Greater Anglia franchise operated by one Railway (later renamed National Express East Anglia) until February 2012, when the franchise was taken over by the current operator Abellio Greater Anglia.

==Operations==
===Services===
Unlike the Heathrow Express and the Gatwick Express (but like other services between London and Heathrow or Gatwick) the trains also stop at an intermediate station between London and the airport. The Stansted Express stops at Tottenham Hale (which provides interchange with the London Underground Victoria Line). The service takes between 46 and 56 minutes to London Liverpool Street, with trains departing every 15 minutes.

Stansted Express offers several ticket types. In addition to the Single and Return tickets, percentage discounts are available for advance bookings, those travelling in pairs with WebDuo and groups with GroupSave. Every Stansted Express ticket comes with money-saving &quot;2FOR1&quot; (two-for-one) offers on some of London&#x27;s favourite restaurants, shows and attractions like The London Eye, Madame Tussauds, the Sea Life Centre and Thorpe Park resort. Oyster or Contactless payment cards are not valid on Stansted Express services to/from Stansted Airport, but can be used between Liverpool Street and Tottenham Hale.

, Stansted Express&#x27; off-peak services Monday to Friday are:


===Criticism===
Transport for London operates a pay-as-you-go system for public transport services. Passengers indicate the journey they are making by presenting a contactless payment card or Oyster card to readers at the start and end of the journey; the system then uses this information to automatically charge the appropriate fare. At stations fitted with ticket barriers, the readers are attached to the barriers and the barriers open when a valid card is presented. Stansted Airport, being located some distance from London, is outside the area covered by this system, so PAYG cannot be used to travel there - instead, a ticket must be purchased. With &#x27;London&#x27; in the name of the airport, rail passengers and visitors to the airport might assume that they would be able to tap out using a contactless card when arriving at the airport from London stations. 

London stations served by the Stansted Express nonetheless have ticket barriers with readers for contactless and Oyster cards because they are also served by other trains on which PAYG can be used. This means it is possible for a passenger to board a Stansted Express train having entered the station using their card, and then travel to Stansted Airport, where they are charged a penalty for travelling without a valid ticket. This has led to accusations that Stansted Express is operating a scam by penalising passengers who are unaware that they have done anything wrong; in 2019 it was reported that the number of penalty charges issued at Stansted Airport was 16,000 per year. The plan of rolling out contactless (and even Oyster) to Stansted is subject to &#x27;necessary funding and approvals [sic] from the Department for Transport&#x27;. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan has expressed his interest in the rollout of contactless payment on the line to remove the current confusion with the system in 2024.

In September 2024, it was reported that Stansted Express services to Stansted Airport, along with 47 unnamed stations across London and South-East England, will be included in contactless and oyster card payments from the second half of 2025 with Â£27million of government funding.

==Rolling stock==
===Current fleet===
As part of the 1,300 new carriages to expand the UK&#x27;s passenger rail fleet, Stansted Express was designated to receive 120 new vehicles. In February 2009, it was announced that Bombardier Transportation would produce the new trains. Bombardier announced on 2 April that a contract had been signed for the delivery of the 120 coaches between December 2010 and March 2011. The first of the new Class 379 units entered passenger service on 3 March 2011. The Class 379s were replaced by Class 745/1s, the first of which entered service on 28 July 2020.

===Past fleet===
Stansted Express originally used a fleet of five Class 322 EMUs until it was decided to change to a dedicated fleet of nine Class 317/7 EMUs in 2000, further supplemented by twelve Class 317/8s in 2006. The displaced Class 322s were redeployed on several other routes/franchises around the country before settling into their former role in Scotland, working services between Glasgow/Edinburgh and North Berwick; they stayed there for some time before transferring to Northern Rail, working out of Leeds. They eventually returned into workings out of London Liverpool Street on the GEML, as Greater Anglia needed replacements for the Class 360s sent to EMR. They are planned to be put out of service by the end of 2022. Following the arrival of the new Class 379 units on Stansted Express services, the Class 317/8s were used alongside Class 317/5 and 317/6 units as a common pool. However, since Abellio took over the East Anglia franchise on 5 February 2012, all but one of the Class 317/7s have been scrapped.

<text>George Brettingham Sowerby I (12 August 1788 â 26 July 1854) was a British naturalist, illustrator and conchologist.

==Life==
He was the second son of James Sowerby. George was educated at home under private tutors, and afterwards assisted his father in the production of illustrated works on natural history. On the latter&#x27;s death in 1822, he and his brother James De Carle Sowerby continued their father&#x27;s work on fossil shells, publishing the latter parts of the &quot;Mineral Conchology of Great Britain&quot;. He published about 50 papers on molluscs and started several comprehensive, illustrated books on the subject, the most important the &quot;Thesaurus Conchyliorum&quot;, a work that was continued by his son, George Brettingham Sowerby II and his grandson George Brettingham Sowerby III. One of his first works was the cataloguing of the collection of the Earl of Tankerville. He also dealt in shells and natural history objects, his place of business being first in King Street, Covent Garden, from which he removed to Regent Street, and finally to Great Russell Street.

He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society on 5 March 1811.

He died at Hanley Road, Hornsey, on 26 July 1854 and is buried on the west side of Highgate Cemetery.
==Family==
By his wife Elizabeth (second daughter of Nicholas and Mary Meredith), whom he married on 16 April 1811, he had two sons, George Brettingham II and Henry (1825â1891), and a daughter, Charlotte Caroline, who became a botanical illustrator.

George&#x27;s son Henry was born in Kensington on 28 March 1825. He was educated at Bickerdike&#x27;s school, Kentish Town, and University College, Gower Street. From 1843 to 1852 he was assistant curator/librarian to the Linnean Society. He went out to Australia in 1854, and became draughtsman at the Melbourne University, and subsequently teacher of drawing in the state schools. During the last twenty years of his life he devoted himself to gold mining. He died near Melbourne on 15 Sept. 1891, having married, in April 1847, Miss Annie Faulkner. He wrote for Reeve&#x27;s popular handbooks &#x27;Popular Mineralogy,&#x27; London, 1850, and illustrated various books such as &quot;Flora Homoeopathica&quot; of Edward Hamilton which appeared in 1852â53.

==Works==

Partial list
* &quot;A Conchological Manual&quot; (1839)
* &quot;Thesaurus Conchyliorum&quot;
* &quot;Illustrated Index of British Shells&quot; (1859)
* &quot;A descriptive catalogue of the species of Leach&#x27;s genus Margarita&quot;. Malacological and Conchological Magazine 1: 23â27 (1838). Henry A. Pilsbry did not think much of this work and said: &quot;His monograph of &quot;Margarita&quot; in Reeve&#x27;s Iconica contains more blunders than any work I have ever seen, unless some other papers by the same author prove to be exceptions.&quot;

==Determined species by Sowerby I==
Many species were first described by Sowerby I, for example

*&quot;Lottia gigantea&quot;
*&quot;Diodora calyculata&quot;
*&quot;Diodora ruepellii&quot;

<text>Graham Macdonald Robb (born 2 June 1958, in Manchester) is a British author and critic specialising in French literature.

== Biography ==
Born at Manchester, Robb attended the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, before going up to Exeter College, Oxford to read Modern Languages, graduating with first-class honours in 1981 (BA (Oxon) proceeding MA).
In 1982, Robb entered Goldsmiths&#x27; College, London to undertake teacher training, before pursuing postgraduate studies at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee where he received a PhD in French literature. He was then awarded a junior research fellowship at Exeter College in the University of Oxford (1987â1990), before leaving academia.

Robb won the 1997 Whitbread Best Biography Award for &quot;Victor Hugo&quot;, and was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize for &quot;Rimbaud&quot; in 2001. &quot;Unlocking MallarmÃ©&quot; had won the Modern Language Association Prize for Independent Scholars in 1996. All three of his biographies (&quot;Victor Hugo&quot;, &quot;Rimbaud&quot; and &quot;Balzac&quot;) became &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Best Books of the Year&quot;. &quot;The Discovery of France&quot; by Robb won the Duff Cooper Prize in 2007 and the RSL Ondaatje Prize in 2008. In &quot;The Discovery of Middle Earth: Mapping the Lost World of the Celts&quot; (2013), he ventures that the ancient Celts organized their territories, determined the locations of settlements and battles, and set the trajectories of tribal migrations by establishing a network of solstice lines based on an extension of the Greek system of &quot;klimata&quot;; as evidence he presented artistic geometries, road surveying, centuriations and other archaeologically attested pre-Roman alignments.

Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1998, Dr Robb was appointed a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2009. Following the publication of his French translation of &quot;Parisians: An Adventure History of Paris&quot;, he was awarded the Medal of the City of Paris in 2012.

Robb married academic Margaret Hambrick in 1986.

<text>The General Electric F101 is an afterburning turbofan jet engine. It powers the Rockwell B-1 Lancer strategic bomber fleet of the USAF. In full afterburner it produces a thrust of more than . The F101 was GE&#x27;s first turbofan with an afterburner.

==Development==
The F101 was developed specifically for the Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft, which became the B-1A. The F101 powered the four development aircraft from 1970 to 1981. The B-1A was officially cancelled in 1977. However the flight test program continued. General Electric was awarded a contract to further develop the F101-102 engine variant. This turbofan eventually powered the B-1B from 1984, entering service in 1986. The B-1&#x27;s four F101 engines helped the aircraft win 61 world records for speed, time-to-climb, payload and range.

The GE F110 turbofan fighter jet engine is a derivative of the F101, designed using data from the F101-powered variant of the F-16 Fighting Falcon tested in the early 1980s. The F101 also became the basis for the highly successful CFM56 series of civil turbofans.

<text>Clontarf (Irish: Cluain Tarbh, meaning &quot;meadow of the bull&quot;) is a suburb of northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Clontarf is located 13 kilometres north-east of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council, in the Northern Beaches region.

==Landmarks==
Clontarf&#x27;s landmarks are Clontarf Beach, Sandy Bay, Castle Rock and Grotto Point.

==History==
Clontarf is named after the Clontarf district in Dublin, Ireland.

The son of Queen Victoria, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, visited Clontarf in 1868 where he was shot in the back by an Irishman, Henry James O&#x27;Farrell. Alfred was saved because the bullet struck him at a point where his India-rubber braces, holding his trousers up, crossed over. The bullet was deflected around his rib-cage and did no major harm.

Clontarf beach was washed away by the 1960 Chilean tsunami.

==Name legacy==

In February 2021 Transport for NSW advised that one of the series 2 &quot;Emerald&quot;-class ferries to commence service on the Manly ferry service, around the middle of 2021, would be named Clontarf after Clontarf Beach.

==Demographics==
According to the , there were 1,746 residents in Clontarf. 64.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 11.2%, China 3.0%, New Zealand 1.9%, South Africa 1.6% and United States of America 1.4%. 84.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 4.0%, Greek 2.1%, Italian 1.1%, French 0.7% and Cantonese 0.7%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.4%, Catholic 20.1% and Anglican 20.1%.

The median age was 47 years, compared to the national median of 38 years, while children aged under 15 years made up 17.5% of the population (national average is 18.2%) and people aged 65 years and over made up 17.6% of the population (national average is 17.3%). The median household income in Clontarf was $4,609 per week, which is nearly triple the national median of $1,746. With high incomes, Clontarf residents also have high housing costs. The median mortgage payment was $5,317 per month compared to $1,863 for all of Australia.

<text>James De Carle Sowerby (5 June 1787 â 26 August 1871) was a British mineralogist, botanist, and illustrator. He received an education in chemistry.

Sowerby was born in London, the son of botanical artist James Sowerby (1757â1822), and his wife, Anne de Carle (1764â1815). He continued his father&#x27;s work and published, together with his brother George Brettingham Sowerby I, the latter volumes of the &quot;Mineral Conchology of Great Britain&quot;, begun by their father.

Together with a cousin, he founded the Royal Botanic Society and Gardens, and was its secretary for 30 years.

His son William Sowerby was also a botanist and illustrator, and succeeded him as Secretary of the Royal Botanic Society in 1869.

In 1846, John William Salter (English naturalist, geologist, palaeontologist, and leading authority on trilobites) married Sally, daughter of Sowerby, and eventually fathered seven children with her.

Sowerby died in Kilburn, London in 1871.

<text>Petalifera is a genus of sea slugs or sea hares, marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Aplysiidae, the sea hares.

Some authors place this genus in a separate family Dolabriferidae. A new study, published in September 2004, has shown that the genus &quot;Petalifera&quot; is paraphyletic.

(Note: Gastropod taxonomy has been in flux for more than half a century, and this is especially true currently, because of new research in molecular phylogeny. Because of all the ongoing changes, different reliable sources can yield very different classifications.)

A more general description can be found on the page of the superfamily Aplysioidea.

==Description==
The parapodia (fleshy winglike outgrowths), as can be seen in photos of &quot;Petalifera petalifera&quot;, are almost completely fused. The pair of small rounded flaps form the parapodial cavity over the mantle cavity and the vestigial shell. These sea hares swim by coiling and uncoiling the body.

==Species==
*&quot;Petalifera albomaculata&quot; - Sri Lanka.
*&quot;Petalifera habei&quot; (synonym of &quot;Petalifera ramosa&quot;)
*&quot;Petalifera krusadalai&quot; 
*&quot;Petalifera petalifera&quot; 
**Distribution : Cosmopolitan.
**Length : 2 to 4Â cm
**Color : grayish to brown, with white longitudinal bands; almost translucent.
**Description : rather flat body; their color camouflages them when they are grazing on the brown alga &quot;Padina&quot;.
*&quot;Petalifera punctulata&quot; 
**Distribution : Japan
*&quot;Petalifera qingdaonensis&quot; 
*&quot;Petalifera ramosa&quot; 
**Distribution : Western Pacific, Atlantic.
**Length : 5 to 7Â cm
**Color : pink to pale brownish, with white rings over the body; almost translucent.
**Description : mantle covered with firm conical tubercles; the larger tubercles have terminal papillae with retractable filamentous branches; difficult to find, mostly hidden under the leaves of green alga &quot;Caulerpa&quot;.

<text>Oatley is a suburb in Southern Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the St George area. Oatley lies in the local government area of Georges River Council. It lies on the northern side of the tidal estuary of the Georges River and its foreshore includes part of Oatley Bay and Lime Kiln Bay, and all of Neverfail Bay, Gungah Bay and Jewfish Bay.

==History==
=== Aboriginal history ===
The area now known as Oatley lies either on the traditional lands of Dharug people or coastal Eora people, both of whom spoke a common language. It lies close to the lands of Tharawal people, on the south bank of the river. Georges River Council acknowledges that the Biddegal/Bidjigal/Bedegal clan of the Eora are the original inhabitants and custodians of land and water in the Georges River region.

Evidence of Aboriginal occupation of the land now known as Oatley exists in the form of numerous shell middens and rock shelters near the shore of Georges River. Lime Kiln Bay once had more extensive shell middens, made over centuries by local people.

=== Settlement ===
One of the earliest contacts between British settlers and Aboriginal people occurred on 20 January 1788, just to the west of Oatley. Arthur Philip and Philip Gidley King, leading a party of seamen from the First Fleet rowing two open boats, explored the &#x27;South-West Arm of Botany Bay&#x27; (now Georges River). They are now thought to have gone as far as Lime Kiln Bay, where they landed at two locations, thought to be just west of the boundaries of modern-day Oatley. Not finding enough freshwater, around Botany Bay and its two &#x27;arms&#x27;, the colonists moved on to Port Jackson, where the settlement of Sydney began six days later.

Lime Kiln Bay takes its name from early settlers burning the shells from the once extensive Aboriginal middens there, to create lime.The kilns were located in what is now Oatley Park.

This suburb&#x27;s name can be traced to James Oatley Snr, a convict clockmaker, who was transported to Botany Bay for life in 1814. Seven years later, in 1821, Governor Lachlan Macquarie granted Oatley a conditional pardon and appointed him overseer of the Town Clock for his work in installing the clock at Hyde Park Barracks.

James Oatley, Snr was granted land in what is now Oatley in 1833, although he never lived there. He called his land Needwood Forest. Oatley&#x27;s land extended from Gungah Bay northward to what later became Hurstville Road and Boundary Road. It to passed to his eldest son Frederick Oatley, who sold it in 1881 to Charles Cecil Griffiths, who was buying up land along the new railway line, with his brother, Frederick Griffiths. James Oatley&#x27;s second son, also James Oatley, became an early mayor of Sydney and member of the NSW Legislative Assembly.

The railway line running through Oatley was opened as far as Sutherland in December 1885. It included a major bridge crossing of the Georges River, from Oatley to Como. The first Oatley railway station opened in 1886; its construction said to have been a condition of the transfer of land from Charles Griffiths for the railway reservation.

The arrival of the railway led to the first residential subdivisions within the area of the original land grant. Many of the streets of the suburb were laid out in these subdivisions. Almost all of Oatley&#x27;s streets to the east of the railway line, bear Victorian-era first names corresponding to members of the Griffiths family. The upper part of Wyong St, before it extended all the way to Neverfail Bay, was known as Cecil Street. There is also a Griffiths Street, west of the railway line.

Slightly predating the subdivisions of the Griffiths&#x27; land was a small hamlet on the flat land near the shore of Neverfail Bay, inhabited mainly by oyster farmers. In its earlier years, the hamlet was reportedly known, informally, as &#x27;Thompsonville&#x27;, the name of one of the oyster growing families.

On 17 August 1898, Oatley was the site of a pursuit and gun battle involving a party of police and George Peisley (or Peasley), a fugitive cattle and horse thief, who was using a sandstone cave on the eastern side of Gungah Bay as his hide out. Peisley escaped capture, but was arrested at Arncliffe on the following day and eventually sentenced to four years hard labour.

Spurred by invasion fears around the time of the Russo-Japanese War, in 1905, land around Neverfail Bay near the Como railway bridge was reserved for military purposes, but nothing was built there. In the same year, the railway line and station were relocated further west to the current alignment.

The post office opened in 1903, thus giving the district its official name of Oatley. Prior to this, the area west of the railway line was officially in the suburb of Hurstville and attached to the Hurstville Post Office with &quot;Oatley&#x27;s&quot; in parentheses at the end of the address. Likewise, the streets east of the railway line were officially in the suburb of Kogarah and attached to the Kogarah Post Office. In the late 1890s both Hurstville and Kogarah were much larger suburbs and were later divided up into separate suburbs.

Oatley is notable as the terminus of the first railway electrification project in Sydney, which reached this station from Sydney Central in 1926. The first scheduled electric train service left Oatley station, at 5:18 am, on Sunday, 3 October 1926.Following construction of the Woronora Dam, since 1942, the old Como railway bridge and the former railway reservation has been used by the main water pipeline from the dam to Penshurst. The pipeline is buried where it passes through the Oatley Memorial Gardens, but remains exposed in the old railway cutting south of Neville St.

In January 1946, the foreshore of Oatley Bay, near Russell Street, was the site of a horrific fatal shark attack, in shallow water. Large sharks have been sighted in the shallow bay, many times over the years, and dogs have been taken. Swimmers at Oatley Park and the Oatley Pleasure Grounds are protected by shark-proof enclosures.

Oatley had a strong association with the growing, and consumption, of Sydney Rock Oysters. In November 1953, an Oatley man won the title of oyster-eating champion of N.S.W, by consuming 26 dozen oysters in 30 minutes The runner up, also from Oatley, pulled out after consuming 21 dozen oysters in 25 minutes. The contest took place in front of a crowd of 3,000, at Moorefields racecourse, Kogarah. In 1949, an Oatley woman was reported to have openedâthe word &#x27;shucked&#x27; was not as commonly used in those timesâ90 dozen oysters in an hour and a half, a sustained rate of a dozen a minute.

When a group gathered in Oatley Park in December 1959, to form a Bowling Club, it was inevitable that the founding members should choose a clock as the club emblem. The hands on the clock were set at 15 minutes after 10 - the precise time the first meeting of the Oatley Bowls Club was opened. The club has since closed, though the greens and Club premises remain.

The Oatley campus of Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education opened in 1981 on the site of the former Judd&#x27;s Brick Works and quarry. In 1981, when many teachers&#x27; colleges were amalgamated, it became The St George Institute of Education, part of Sydney College of Advanced Education, and subsequently a campus of the University of New South Wales. It is now a secondary school â the Oatley Senior Campus of the Georges River College.

Prior to the formation of Georges River Council, in 2016, the part of Oatley to the west of the railway line was in the City of Hurstville, and the part of Oatley to the east of the railway line was in the City of Kogarah.

=== Local Industries ===
Although now an entirely residential suburb, Oatley was the site of various industries in the past.

==== Oyster farming ====
For over a century, Sydney Rock Oysters were grown commercially along the shores of Georges River at Oatley. Freshwater from the Woronora River, a tributary that joins the Georges River opposite Oatley, caused suitable growing conditionsâclean water and slightly reduced salinityâ for faster-growing, plump rock oysters. There is a significant freshwater component in the flow of the Georges River itself; at times a small standing wave develops across the narrow part of the river estuary, between Jewfish Point (Oatley) and the opposite southern shore (Illawong), when the flow of the Georges River meets the incoming flood tide. Salinity in the river increases downstream, and is suitable for oysters from around Soily Bottom Point, at Lugarno. Overall, conditions on the Georges River were once ideal for oyster farming. The river also had the advantage that it was the only oyster growing area within the suburban area of the largest market, and close to transport, even earlier years.
Six families of oyster farmers worked from the head of Neverfail Bay just to the east of the Como Railway Bridge. Neverfail Bay was the base for working oyster leases both upstream and downstream on the Georges River. There was a smaller oyster farming site at the head of Jewfish Bay just outside the eastern boundary of Oatley Park. Modern-day oyster shell &#x27;middens&#x27; and a few decaying remnants of oyster farming still existed at these locations in 2021. Oysters were cultivated on racks, or on artificially created shell banks or rock beds, that were installed on river mudbanks and, west of the Como rail bridge, on the rocks of shoreline leases. For many years, oysters were shipped to market in hessian sacksâeach sack containing around 100 dozen oystersâfrom Oatley railway station, by electric rail parcel vans. There was also long-standing and lucrative criminal activity involving the theft of oysters from leases. In late 1934, shots were fired at oyster poachers by police patrolling the leases. Oyster farmers would at times patrol their leases themselves, at night, using boats fitted with small searchlights to scan their leases.

==== Decline and end of oyster farming ====
The industry on the Georges River reached its productive peak in the 1970s. In the financial year 1976-1977, the river produced 2,563 tonnes of oysters, over a quarter of the record statewide production total of 9,375 tonnes.
The local oyster farming industry survived opposition from Georges River Oyster Lease Protest Association (GROLPA), Kogarah Council andâto a lesser extentâHurstville Council, reduced freshwater flows from the Woronora River, impacts of Tributyltin (TBT) anti-fouling compound for boats, invasive wild Pacific Oysters, increasing urbanisation, river silting, and increasing water turbidity and pollution. 

After a major gastroenteritis event that was traced to Georges River oysters, in 1978, harvesting was suspended after heavy rain events, water quality tested regularly, and oysters were subjected to 36 to 48-hours of filtration and ultra-violet exposure in a small cooperative facility at Neverfail Bay. Changes to the sewage system were also made, with discharges from upstream sewage plants at Glenfield and Liverpool redirected to the ocean outfall at Malabar. Despite these precautions and improvements, there was another food poisoning event in May 1990, when Sydney Water failed to advise Georges River oyster farmers of a large sewage overflow upstream, which occurred after a satisfactory water quality test. Sales were banned for a period. The timing was bad, because Georges River oysters dominated the market from April to August. Such events damaged the reputation of oysters from the river, causing consumers to shun Georges River oysters.

In 1992, there was a catastrophic outbreak of &#x27;winter mortality&#x27;, a poorly-understood seasonal disease caused by a protozoan parasite, &quot;Mikiocytos roughleyi.&quot; The oyster farmers at Oatley had limited the impact of winter mortality, by moving their oysters on trays, to more sheltered waters with lower salinity, such as near the Woronora River confluence and Bonnet Bay, and then placing the trays on racks higher in the intertidal zone. This &#x27;wintering&#x27; methodâfirst proposed by noted oyster zoologist, Theodore Roughley, in the 1920sâwas not effective, in 1992, with the Georges River oyster harvest down by 70%.

Oyster farming at Oatley finally succumbed in the mid-1990s, to the spread of &#x27;QX disease&#x27;. QX is caused by a protozoan parasite, &quot;Marteilia sydneyi&quot;, which affects Sydney Rock Oysters. When it first appeared in the river in 1994, it wiped out 90% of the farmed oysters. Effects of QX were worst in parts of the river with lower salinity. QX-resistant oyster strains came too late to save most of the Georges River industry. There was still some oyster farming at activity at Neverfail Bay, as late as 1999, but it did not last.

There are now no oyster leases at or near Oatley. One of the old families later farmed oysters downstream, at Woolooware Bay, but sold that lease in 2013. By 2023, the last operating oyster farmer at Woolooware Bay had been forced to close, and the future of that last oyster-growing site in the Georges River estuary was uncertain.

==== Judd&#x27;s Hurstville Brickworks ====
Judd&#x27;s Hurstville Brickworks was located on the northern side of Hurstville Road; its 13-hectare site straddled the northern boundary of Oatley with neighbouring Mortdale. It was established by William George Judd (1847â1929). It operated from 1884 to 1972, making bricks using shale from a quarry that occupied much of the Oatley end of the site. Two tall brick chimneys were demolished in June 1973, along with the brick-making plant and kilns, and the company went into voluntary liquidation. The brickworks once had its own railway siding. Fifteen brick cottages were built along the western side of Judd Street, just across the boundary between Mortdale and Oatley, to rent to workers at the brickworks; some still survive.

==== Factories ====
A factory owned by Albert Page, which once existed on the south-eastern corner of Rosa Street and Hurstville Road, manufactured vehicle number plates from 1935 to the 1950s. The Quill paper products factory was later on the same site. Surelli Furniture Pty Ltd operated a factory on the western side of Ada Street near the junction with Hurstville Road, until the late 1980s. Both these factory sites are now occupied by medium-density housing. The Cuthbertson family ran a small factory making children&#x27;s and babies&#x27; shoes, behind their residence at 46 Rosa Street, from after WWI until 1959 when they moved the factory to a site in Mortdale.

=== Local environmental activism ===
As well as having been the home of prominent conservation campaigners, Myles and Milo Dunphy, Oatley has one of the longest-lived local conservation groups in Sydney, the Oatley Flora and Fauna Conservation Society (OFF). It was founded in 1955 and is still active. Up to the 1970s, land at the heads of both Oatley Bay and Lime Kiln Bay was being reclaimed in mangrove forests, with upper Lime Kiln Bay being used as a landfill tip. Paradoxically, much of the mangrove growth at Lime Kiln Bay (and in Gungah Bay) was a sign of earlier ecological disturbance, as landward expansion of mangrove forests had taken over, between 1930 and 1970, much of what had previously been an extensive salt marsh habitat.

OFF successfully led campaigns to end reclamation, on both Oatley and Lime Kiln bays. They allied with local oyster farmersâconcerned about contaminated water leaching from the tips and affecting water quality in the riverâand other local conservation societies to achieve the outcome.

== Heritage listings ==
Oatley has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Illawarra railway: Oatley railway station
* over Georges River: Old Como railway bridge
*Residential building - 92 Rosa Street, Oatley.

== Commercial area ==
The main shopping centre is located on Oatley Avenue and Frederick Street, near the railway station. A group of shops and a Coles Supermarket are located along the southern side of Mulga Road, between Waratah and Myall Streets, which are referred to as the Oatley West shops. A third group of shops at the intersection of Baker Street and Lansdowne Paradeâin the locality of Jewfish Pointâis now mainly converted to non-retail businesses.

==Transport==
Originally, the railway ran east of the present Mortdale Railway Sheds and down the western side of Oatley Avenue, on land that is now the Oatley Memorial Gardens. The first station platform was located at the western end of Frederick Street and extended north to opposite what is now the Oatley Hotel car park. The railway was realigned and the current station opened in 1905. The electrification of the passenger network began in 1926 with the first suburban electric services running between Sydney&#x27;s Central Station and Oatley.

Oatley railway station is the last station on the Sydney Trains Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra railway line before crossing the Georges River to Como in the Sutherland Shire. The 955 bus route operates a service from Mortdale through Oatley West and Oatley to Hurstville.

==Parks==
The area&#x27;s main attraction is Oatley Park but there are also a number of local bush parks surrounding the suburb: Oatley Point Reserve, Oatley Pleasure Grounds, Moore Reserve, Renown Park, Lime Kiln Bay Bushland Sanctuary, Giriwa Picnic Ground, Stevens Reserve, Meyer Reserve, and the Myles Dunphy Bushland Reserve (in which foot tracks were improved in 2011, by Hurstville Council). They attract many birds both native and introduced, with Oatley Park alone recording 146 species; as many as 90 recently.

===Oatley Park===
Oatley Park is a tree covered promontory that is almost completely surrounded by the Georges River. It covers an area of about and it is one of the significant areas of bushland remaining in the St George area.

Oatley Park became a public recreation area on 25 March 1887. In October 1893, when the nearby residential subdivision was sold off, it was known as Peakhurst Park. It was renamed to Oatley Park in March 1922.

It protects important examples of the natural environment which occur throughout the park. In addition, there is a swimming area, a playground featuring an old steamroller, lookouts, barbecues, a soccer/cricket oval, and a &quot;castle&quot;. The man-made wetlands of Lime Kiln Bay Reserve which adjoin Oatley Park provide refuge for bird species such as chestnut teal, Pacific black ducks, dusky moorhens and purple swamphens. Native mammals which are uncommon in the region can still be found within the park, including the short-beaked echidna and the swamp wallaby.

=== Oatley Pleasure Grounds ===

Oatley Pleasure Grounds is a bush park located on Annette Street. It covers an area of and was built by Harry Linmark before 1934. Numerous performances occurred in the park previously, and a wine bar was constructed. The bar was later shut down due to noise complaints.

<text>Leslie Thomas John Arlott, (25 February 1914 â 14 December 1991) was an English journalist, author and cricket commentator for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Test Match Special&quot;. He was also a poet and wine connoisseur. With his poetic phraseology, he became a cricket commentator noted for his &quot;wonderful gift for evoking cricketing moments&quot; by the BBC.

==Early life==

John Arlott was born in 1914 at Cemetery Lodge, Chapel Hill, Basingstoke in Hampshire, the son of cemetery registrar William John Arlott and Nellie (nÃ©e Jenvey-Clarke). He attended Fairfields Primary School in Basingstoke before winning a scholarship to Queen Mary&#x27;s Grammar School. Once at the school, however, he became embroiled in a feud with the headmaster, as the school &quot;had not been wholly receptive to his young, independent, inquiring mind.&quot; Arlott eventually left the school of his own accord. He meanwhile showed an early interest in the local cricket matches; in 1926 he watched England and Australia play at The Oval, becoming a fan of Jack Hobbs, and later watched Sussex play Lancashire.

===Pre-media career 1930â46===

After leaving school, following a brief stint at the local town hall where he learned to type, he spent four years working at Park Prewett Mental Hospital in Basingstoke as a records clerk (1930â34). His friend David Rayvern Allen noted that it was there that &quot;he discovered humanity in often dislocated forms, [which] was fundamental to his personal development.&quot; This was followed by twelve years as a policeman (1934â1946) in the Southampton County Borough Police Force, which later amalgamated with the Hampshire Constabulary in 1967. He progressed to the rank of sergeant while stationed at Southampton, and enjoyed the opportunity to watch Hampshire play at the County Ground while on duty at Northland Road. Though his cricket skills were not sufficient to play for the Southampton Police cricket XI, he was called upon at times to utilise the PA-system. He also studied Russian language and military history at the library of Southampton University, wrote reports for his chief constable, gave lectures to students, wrote poetry, and took up boxing, at which he was quite proficient.

==First-class cricket experience==

He played cricket at club level but would spend most of his free summer time following the Hampshire team both home and away. As a result of his regular support he became known to the team and this led to his one and only brief playing exposure to the first-class game. He was watching Hampshire play Kent at Canterbury in August 1938 when they discovered they would be short of a twelfth man for the following game. Being willing and available, young Arlott was co-opted and he travelled with the team to Worcester. Hampshire had had to use three substitute fielders when two of their XI were injured and skipper Cecil Paris suffered a puncture on his way to the ground.

The following day, the match report in the &quot;Western Daily Press&quot; named one of the substitutes as &quot;Harlott&quot;, a local policeman and a Hampshire member. It was quite a memorable day in the field, with the Nawab of Pataudi scoring an elegant undefeated century for Worcester in one of his very rare appearances on the county circuit. The match ultimately fizzled out as just a tame draw with Hampshire scoring 313 and 91 â 2 and Worcester 413 â 3 declared. It was his one and only appearance in a first class cricket fixture and it proved to be the pinnacle of his playing career.

In 1980, he was asked whether playing first-class cricket on a regular basis might have provided him with greater insight as a cricket writer. He replied: &quot;My word, I know what the problems are. I&#x27;ve failed at everything.&quot;

==Broadcasting==

===BBC debut===
After being invited to make a public radio address to George VI on VE Day, 1945, he attracted the attention of the BBC, and of John Betjeman, who became a mentor for Arlott&#x27;s poetic ambitions. Arlott subsequently joined the BBC as the Overseas Literary Producer the following year.

He was asked by the Head of the BBC Overseas Service, Donald Stevenson, to commentate on the warm-up games of India&#x27;s tour of England in 1946. Arlott&#x27;s commentary &quot;went down very well in India&quot; and he was invited to continue to commentate on further matches, including the Test matches, initiating a 34-year career as a cricket commentator for the BBC. At first he encountered some resentment from his colleagues in the commentary box, initially clashing with EW Swanton, but despite this he rapidly established his own particular niche. From 1946 until he retired at the end of the 1980 season, Arlott covered every single home Test match. He went on only two overseas England tours, to South Africa in 1948â1949 and Australia in 1954â1955.

===&quot;Test Match Special&quot;===
Prior to 1957, BBC radio covered every home Test match, with Arlott normally one of the commentators, but it did not broadcast uninterrupted ball-by-ball commentary. &quot;Test Match Special (TMS)&quot; was launched on 30 May 1957, providing a full ball-by-ball Test Match commentary service on the medium wave service of the BBC Third Programme. The first match covered was the first Test between England and the West Indies at Edgbaston. The &quot;TMS&quot; commentators that day were Arlott, Rex Alston and E. W. Swanton, with summaries provided by Ken Ablack, from the West Indies, together with Norman Yardley and Freddie Brown. When he retired in September 1980, he was the longest-serving &quot;TMS&quot; commentator, equalled by Brian Johnston in 1993 and subsequently exceeded by Christopher Martin-Jenkins.

===Television commentary===
Arlott undertook some BBC television cricket commentary, between 1964 and 1968 featuring matches between various counties vs an International Cavaliers X1, which were played on Sundays with 25 overs per side and then primarily on the Sunday League from 1969 to 1980. These John Player Sunday League limited over fixtures were 40 overs a side and were usually played between 2.00Â pm and 6.30Â pm. Arlott commentated on the first 20 overs of each innings with Jim Laker usually covering the last 20. He also briefly wrote, directed and narrated a topical local series for the BBC called &quot;ABC of the South&quot; in the 1960s but radio was his true metier.

===Commentating style===
Arlott was a popular commentator partly because of his gift for poetic phraseology. The BBC commented that &quot;the style of commentary owed much to the poet in John. He would relish the phrases he used to describe what he saw and leave his colleagues wishing they could have thought of them,&quot; while &quot;Wisden&quot; wrote: &quot;it is his unique gift for cricket commentary which will bring him lasting fame... His commentary technique was strongly influenced by his poetic sense. With the economy of a poet he could describe a piece of play without fuss or over-elaboration, being always conscious of its rhythm and mindful of its background. He was never repetitive or monotonous, except for effect. The listener&#x27;s imagination was given free rein.&quot;

One comment often noted was made in 1975, to describe a shot by Clive Lloyd as &quot;the stroke of a man knocking a thistle top off with a walking stick.&quot; On England&#x27;s 1948â9 tour to South Africa, the England captain George Mann was bowled by his namesake Tufty Mann. Arlott memorably described it as &quot;a case of Mann&#x27;s inhumanity to Mann&quot;. He also had the advantage of a very distinctive voice. Frank Keating wrote of his &quot;articulate, leisurely, confiding countryman&#x27;s burr&quot;. Keating also compared his stature as a radio journalist with those of Richard Dimbleby and Alistair Cooke.

===Final Test Match===
Arlott&#x27;s final Test commentary was on the Centenary Test between England and Australia at Lord&#x27;s in 1980. At the end of his last session on the final day (2 September), he concluded with his customary phrasing &quot;nine runs off the over â 28 Boycott, 15 Gower, 69 for 2 â and after Trevor Bailey it will be Christopher Martin-Jenkins.&quot; At the end of the following over, a public address announcement that Arlott had completed his final commentary session prompted the crowd to give Arlott an ovation. The entire Australian team in the field and the two England batsmen joined in, with Geoffrey Boycott removing his batting gloves to applaud. Later that day, after the match ended in a draw, he came onto the Lord&#x27;s balcony to present the Man of the Match award. When he appeared, the crowd below again burst into a spontaneous ovation that lasted for several minutes before he was finally able to speak and make the presentation to Kim Hughes.

Four days later, Arlott returned to Lord&#x27;s for his last commentary, covering the 1980 Gillette Cup final.

==Writer==
Arlott was a stylish writer, contributing regularly as a journalist and also writing the occasional hymn, of which the best-known is &quot;God Whose Farm is All Creation&quot;, sung at harvest festival. Two others were &quot;By the rutted roads we follow&quot; for Plough Sunday and &quot;We watched the winter turn its back&quot; for Rogation. As his interest in wine developed he wrote two books on that subject; he also wrote poetry, considering his best poem to be the one dedicated to Sir Jack Hobbs on the latter&#x27;s 70th birthday. Well-versed in cricket history, Arlott was often viewed as a leading authority, especially on the literature of the game. He wrote annual reviews of the year&#x27;s cricket books for &quot;Wisden&quot; for every year from 1950 until 1992, except for 1979 and 1980. He also wrote a well received appreciation of Neville Cardus for the 1965 edition. He wrote articles on cricket art and history for the encyclopaedia &quot;Barclays World of Cricket&quot;.

He had many books published, including: &quot;Of Period and Place&quot;, a book of poetry (1944); &quot;Indian Summer&quot; (1946); &quot;Concerning Cricket&quot; (1949); &quot;Maurice Tate&quot; (1951); &quot;Test Match Diary&quot; (1953); &quot;Vintage Summer&quot; (1967); &quot;Fred â Portrait of a Fast bowler&quot; (1971); &quot;A Hundred Years of County Cricket&quot; (1973); &quot;John Arlott&#x27;s book of cricketers&quot; (1979); &quot;Jack Hobbs: Profile of the Master&quot; (1981) and &quot;Basingstoke Boy: The Autobiography&quot; (1989). &quot;A Word From Arlott&quot; and &quot;Arlott in Conversation&quot; were published in 1983 and 1984 respectively as collections of his commentaries and writings. He was also the narrator and technical advisor for the documentary short film &quot;Cricket&quot; (1950).

===Biographical writings about Arlott===

*&quot;Basingstoke Boy: Autobiography&quot;, by John Arlott, published 1992.
*&quot;Arlott: The Authorised Biography&quot;, by David Rayvern Allen, published in 1993, won The Cricket Society Jubilee Literary Award. 
*&quot;John Arlott, A Memoir&quot;, written by his son Tim Arlott, was published in 1994.
*&quot;Arlott, Swanton and the Soul of English Cricket&quot;, by Stephen Fay and David Kynaston, 2018. This is a joint biography with the other great English cricket writer of the period, E.W. Swanton. It compares and contrasts their different views about cricket and its place in the world.

===Journalism===
His career in journalism began with the &quot;Evening News&quot; in 1950. In 1955 he switched to the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, where he stayed until the paper folded in 1960. He began reporting football matches for &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1958. He also wrote occasional articles for &quot;The Times&quot;. Arlott joined &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1968 as chief cricket correspondent, where he would stay until 1980. He was also asked to comment on football matches. He was assigned at his own request to cover the Manchester United v Red Star Belgrade European Cup match in Yugoslavia. At the last minute their chief soccer correspondent Donny Davies pulled rank and decided to go instead. The aircraft bringing back the team, officials and press crashed in what became known as the Munich air disaster and Davies was one of the fatalities. Arlott stopped covering soccer in 1977 after some violent post match incidents with hooligan fans.

===Cricket Writers&#x27; Club===
He became an early member of the Cricket Writers&#x27; Club, founded in 1947, whose dinners in those days were lavish affairs and often held in liveried halls. Basil Easterbrook, chairman in 1965, recalled an attempt to ban drinking until after the AGM which normally preceded the annual dinner. &quot;There was much noise, calls for order and the singing of a ribald chorus of &#x27;On Rosenwater&#x27;s doorstep, down Leytonstone way&#x27; to the tune of Mother Kelly. Irving Rosenwater was a leading member at that time and some of the club&#x27;s elder statesmen were angry enough to walk out. John Arlott was the chairman at that meeting and, as was his custom, had taken the odd sip of wine. John tried hard to bring some order to the proceedings by banging the table with a spoon, but he missed the table.&quot;

===Working abroad===
Ramchandra Guha, wrote about the interaction Arlott had with Vijay Merchant; he described Arlott&#x27;s background with the &quot;prejudices of a conventional British upbringing.&quot; In 1946, Arlott asked Merchant &quot;whether in view of the ongoing sectarian violence, India really deserved independence. Should not the white man, he said, stay on to secure the peace?&quot; Guha wrote that &quot;...Friendship with Merchant broadened his social and political horizons&quot;. In 1948, he travelled to South Africa to cover the England cricket team&#x27;s tour for the BBC, and openly voiced his distaste for the country&#x27;s apartheid policy. When asked to mark his race on an immigration form â whether &quot;white, Indian, coloured, black&quot;, Arlott wrote &quot;human&quot;.

Arlott visited Australia during the winter of 1954â55, to cover the successful defence of The Ashes by the team led by Len Hutton. His next and last overseas assignment as a cricket commentator was over 20 years later for the BBC in Australia to commentate on the 1977 Centenary match where he described &quot;the seagulls standing in line like vultures for Lillee&quot;.

==Other cricket involvement==

===D&#x27;Oliveira affair===

Basil D&#x27;Oliveira was a South African who was classified as a Cape Coloured by the apartheid regime and consequently was ineligible to play first-class cricket. He wrote to Arlott in the late 1950s, after hearing his radio commentaries, because &quot;his voice and the words he spoke convinced me he was a nice, compassionate man&quot;. He wanted help to find an opportunity to play professional cricket in England and Arlott finally got him a summer contract with Middleton Cricket Club in the Central Lancashire Cricket League in 1960. Arlott subsequently said that this was the achievement in his career of which he felt most proud. After topping the Central Lancashire League batting averages in his first season he subsequently graduated to the first-class county circuit with Worcestershire in 1964. D&#x27;Oliveira acquired British nationality the following year and was selected to play for England, making his Test debut against the West Indies at Lord&#x27;s in June 1966.

During the 1968 Ashes series, D&#x27;Oliveira scored 158 on his recall to the England side in the 5th Test Match at The Oval, which seemed to make his selection for the winter tour to South Africa a certainty. However, when the touring side was announced he was controversially omitted amidst allegations of South African political interference with the selection committee. Arlott was incensed and condemned the selectors&#x27; decision in his press articles and publicly stated that he would not commentate on any matches involving the South African team during their scheduled tour of England in 1970. Arlott received support from many people over his uncompromising stand, including future England captain Mike Brearley, who called for the cessation of all South African tours, and the Reverend David Sheppard, who had been one of the first players to speak out against apartheid and who had also previously refused to play against the 1960 South African touring side. However, Arlott was subjected to some strong, not entirely unexpected, criticism from the English cricket establishment over his stance particularly by the former England captain Peter May, a Test selector, who wrote directly to him condemning the position that he had adopted.

When Tom Cartwright subsequently had to drop out of the touring side because of an injury, D&#x27;Oliveira was selected as his replacement, which led to the tour being cancelled by the South African government. The subsequent South African 1970 tour to England was also cancelled and they were then ostracised by the other Test playing countries. South Africa were then officially excluded from Test cricket for 21 years until they were reinstated by the ICC in 1991 following the South African government&#x27;s legalisation of the ANC and the release of Nelson Mandela.

===Cambridge Union Debate===
Following the cancellation of the 1968 England tour by the South African government, the Cambridge Union decided to hold a debate on the motion &quot;That politics should not intrude on sporting contacts&quot;. Former England captain Ted Dexter was invited to propose the motion, seconded by veteran all-round sportsman Wilf Wooller who had skippered Glamorgan to their first county championship in 1948. Both of these ex-players were friends of Arlott. Opposing the motion were the incumbent minister for sport, Denis Howell, seconded by Arlott.

Arlott spoke passionately against the motion stating that &quot;It is political commitment and political belief that can make a man think that his opponent&#x27;s views are so obnoxious that he will abstain from playing any game with him as a protest against what the other man believes. Any man&#x27;s political commitment, if it is deep enough, is his very personal philosophy and it governs his whole way of life, it governs his belief, and it certainly governs the people with whom he is prepared to mix.&quot; The motion was duly defeated by 334â160. Despite their opposing positions over the issue, Arlott was drinking with Wooller in the Cambridge Union Bar shortly after the debate had finished.

Arlott maintained his strong views on the issue and two years later he came to an unprecedented agreement with the BBC to be excused from commentating on the upcoming Test series against South Africa in England without prejudicing his future commentary role on Test matches against other touring teams in subsequent years. However, the British government subsequently cancelled the tour over public order concerns at each Test venue. A Rest of the World side, captained by Gary Sobers and including five South African team members, played a five-match &#x27;Test&#x27; series instead, with Arlott rejoining the TMS commentary team to cover those matches.

===Friendship with Ian Botham===
Ian Botham: &quot;I met John when I was 17 and took his picnic basket up to the commentary box. There were four bottles of Beaujolais in that basket. Being a cider-boy I thought wine was a namby-pamby drink. But I was gripped as John started talking to me, this dumb yokel, about wine. His command of English just rolled off him. He got out some cheese and said this goes best with that wine. &#x27;Go on,&#x27; he&#x27;d say, have a taste.&#x27; Our incredible friendship started and he became my mentor. These days they call &#x27;em life-gurus or some such crap.&quot;

Botham also had a holiday home nearby in Alderney and during the last seven years of Arlott&#x27;s life they often had two meals a day together when he was staying on the island. &quot;At six minutes past nine every morning the phone would ring. John would say, &#x27;C&#x27;mon over â and bring your thirst with you.&#x27; At the end when the emphysema took over and he was struggling with speech he had an oxygen mask and I often had to empty his bag for him. But he liked me being there because I knew to wait and let him finish his sentences between gasps. I didn&#x27;t try to say the words for him because I knew how much they mattered. That was strange for me â to be patient and quiet. But I always wanted to listen to John.&quot;

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1992, Botham and his wife instigated a family tradition of breaking open a bottle of Beaujolais at Arlott&#x27;s grave and toasting his memory.

===Presidency of the Cricketers&#x27; Association===
He was a great advocate of county cricket and its players. He became President of the Cricketers&#x27; Association in 1968, which aimed to raise salaries and improve the conditions of employment of the county cricketer. &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that &quot;democratic views and wise counsel earned him much respect in the cricket world and among the players. His moderation and tact helped in some tight corners, notably at the time of the Packer Affair, when he strove to keep the Cricketers&#x27; Association neutral.&quot;

===Master&#x27;s Club===
Arlott had developed a close friendship with Sir Jack Hobbs, who ran a sports shop in Fleet Street after his retirement from cricket. Arlott&#x27;s admiration and respect led him to establish the Master&#x27;s Club to honour his birthday, on 16 December. The inaugural lunch was held in 1953 at a restaurant in Fleet Street and was attended by John Marshall (London &quot;Evening News&quot;), Kenneth Adam (BBC) and Alf Gover (Surrey). Membership of the club increased over the years and the annual lunch was eventually moved to the Long Room at The Oval. Despite the demise of all of the original members, it still thrives and continues to meet for lunch every year either on, or close to, Hobbs&#x27; 16 December birthday. In keeping with tradition, the lunch always consists of Sir Jack&#x27;s favourite meal, roast lamb followed by apple pie.

===Dream Desert Island XI===
Arlott&#x27;s dream team contained seven Englishmen, three West Indians and only one Australian. The team in probable batting order was: Jack Hobbs, Mike Brearley, Vivian Richards, Learie Constantine, Ted Dexter, Ian Botham, Keith Miller, Wilfred Rhodes, George Brown (WK), Jim Laker and Wes Hall. The reserves were Basil D&#x27;Oliveira, Doug Wright, Leo Harrison (WK) and Frank Tyson.

He was also invited in 1981 to select his Best XI from players who, for a wide variety of reasons, were never capped by England. His team was John Langridge (Sussex), Maurice Hallam (Leicestershire), Emrys Davies (Glamorgan), Edgar Oldroyd (Yorkshire), Jack Newman (Hampshire), Harry Martyn (WK) (Somerset), Peter Sainsbury (Hampshire), Wilf Wooller (Captain) (Glamorgan), Don Shepherd (Glamorgan), Charles Kortright (Essex) and Tom Wass (Nottinghamshire). &quot;The side bats down to No. 7. There are seven bowlers...it has at least six good catchers and a number of cricketers of competitive quality and good temperament: and it would be good to watch.&quot;

==Other interests==

===Wine connoisseur===
During a stopover in Sicily in 1949, on his return journey from South Africa, Arlott tasted wine for the first time at the age of 35. From that day he eschewed beer and spirits and devoted himself to cultivating his love of wine. The following year, after recommending some wine to John Marshall, the editor of the London &quot;Evening News&quot;, he was invited to write a weekly wine column for that newspaper and this resulted in invitations to press tours of French wine regions.

In due course he became a connoisseur of wine, and was often accompanied by some good claret to help lubricate his voice through a day of cricket commentating. He subsequently wrote a regular wine column for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper and he also published two books, &quot;Burgundy Vines and Wines&quot; co-written with Christopher Fielden in 1976, and &quot;Arlott on Wine&quot; in 1987. Before retiring to Alderney, he auctioned his well-stocked wine cellar containing many fine clarets, at Sotheby&#x27;s.

===Politics===

Arlott espoused strong liberal and humanitarian political views and he stood as the Liberal candidate for Epping in both the 1955 and 1959 general elections, coming third on both occasions but achieving strong support at a time when the Liberals were weak nationally. He appeared frequently on the radio programme &quot;Any Questions?&quot;, on which panellists debate topical issues of the day.

Reviewing &quot;John Arlott: Cricket&#x27;s Radical Voice&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 to mark the twentieth anniversary of his death, Gillian Reynolds wrote in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of &quot;Arlott&#x27;s independence, his Englishness, sense of fairness and justice, sympathy for the underdog and relish for the beautiful and the good&quot;.

===&quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;===
Arlott was twice invited to appear on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; with Roy Plomley, in May 1953 and again in May 1975.

In May 1953 he selected:
&quot;Lord Lovel&quot; by Robert Irwin;
&quot;Land of My Fathers&quot; by Crowd at Wales V Ireland Rugby Match, 12 March 1949;
&quot;These Foolish Things&quot; by Greta Keller;
&quot;The foggy, foggy dew&quot; by Benjamin Britten;
&quot;Bella figlia dell&#x27;amore&quot; (from &quot;Rigoletto&quot;) by Giuseppe Verdi;
&quot;Little Sir William&quot; by Benjamin Britten;
&quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot; by Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge;
Symphony No. 7 in A major by Ludwig van Beethoven;
his luxury item was a second-hand bookshop.

In May 1975 he selected
Melody in F major, Op. 3/1 by Anton Rubinstein;
&quot;Mercy Pourin&#x27; Down&quot; by Edric Connor;
&quot;Kalinka&quot; by Don Cossacks;
&quot;Fern Hill&quot; by Dylan Thomas (his nominated favourite);
&quot;To Lizbie Brown&quot; by Gerald Finzi;
&quot;Buttercup Joe&quot; by The Yetties;
&quot;Go Down You Red Red Roses&quot; by Burl Ives; and
&quot;The Boars&quot; by the Elizabeth Singers;
his luxury item was champagne.

==Awards==
He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1970 New Year Honours. He was made a life member of the MCC in 1980. He won the Sports Journalist of the Year Award in 1979, and was Sports Presenter of the Year in 1980. In July 1973 the University of Southampton awarded him an honorary degree, and in June 1981 he was afforded the same honour by The Open University. His contribution to British radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Arlott was married three times: his first wife was Dawn Rees (married 18 May 1940 â divorced 1958), with whom he had two sons, James Andrew (1944â1965) and Timothy Mark (born 1950). His second wife was Valerie France (married July 1960 â died 1976), with whom he had a third son Robert, (born 1963), after a daughter named Lynne had died at birth the previous year. His third wife was Patricia Hoare (6 April 1977 â 1991) who survived him. Arlott&#x27;s eldest son Jim was killed in a car accident on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1965, driving home late at night from Southampton in a sports car which Arlott had helped him to buy. This tragedy resulted in Arlott always wearing a black tie in remembrance of his son and in penance for his own role in the tragedy.

==Retirement and later life==
He retired as a cricket commentator at the end of the 1980 season. &quot;The decision was freely taken; and although it was not easy to go, was a better choice than, one day, being told to go.&quot; Four days after the Centenary Test at Lord&#x27;s ended in a draw, Arlott made his very last commentary, covering the Gillette Cup Final between Surrey and Middlesex for BBC Radio 3.

Leaving New Alresford in 1981, after 20 years, he moved to The Vines on Alderney in the Channel Islands. His health was fragile and he suffered from emphysema and chronic bronchitis after years of smoking.

===Death===
He died in his sleep in the early morning on Saturday 14 December 1991 and was buried in the island cemetery. Engraved on his headstone were two lines from one of his own poems (originally dedicated to Andrew Young): &quot;So clear you see those timeless things, That, like a bird, the vision sings&quot;.

===Memorial trust===
The Princess Royal, as President of the Rural Housing Trust, gave a reception at Buckingham Palace on 10 February 1993 to launch the John Arlott Memorial Trust in conjunction with the National Playing Fields Association. The trust was a tribute to Arlott&#x27;s memory in creating a fund to provide affordable village housing and recreational areas in some of England&#x27;s 8,000 villages and it is now a national charity chaired by former newscaster Sir Trevor McDonald. The annual charity dinner is sponsored by the Rioja Wine Exporters Group reflecting his great fondness for that particular wine.

===New Alresford memorial===
Arlott had originally bought the former pub in New Alresford in 1961. It had originally been called The Sun Inn prior to its closure in 1958, but he renamed it The Old Sun. He completely renovated the interior, especially the large cellar for his collection of fine wine. He also became active in the local community becoming President of the newly founded Alresford Historical and Literary Society in 1966 until he relocated to Alderney 15 years later.
Subsequently, at a ceremony on 21 June 2009, a plaque commemorating his 20 years of living at the Old Sun between 1961 and 1981 was unveiled by his sons Tim and Robert Arlott. The plaque was funded by The Cricket Society and the guest of honour, who cut the ceremonial cake, was his oldest friend Leo Harrison (then 87). This was followed by an inaugural local village cricket competition, with participating teams from Tichborne, Old Alresford, Ropley and Cheriton, for the annual John Arlott Cup.

===Memorable quotes by Arlott===
&quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in March 2006 published a list of 25 favourite sporting quotes â these two Arlottisms were included:

Bradman out for a duck: &quot;Hollies pitches the ball up slowly and ... he&#x27;s bowled... Bradman bowled Hollies, nought ... bowled Hollies nought ... and what do you say under these circumstances? I wonder if you see the ball very clearly in your last Test in England, on a ground where you&#x27;ve played some of the biggest cricket in your life and where the opposing side has just stood round you and given you three cheers, and the crowd has clapped you all the way to the wicket. I wonder if you see the ball at all.&quot; (1948)

We have a freaker: &quot;We have got a freaker [sic] down the wicket now, not very shapely as it is masculine, and I would think it has seen the last of its cricket for the day ... he has had his load, he is being embraced by a blond policeman and this may well be his last public appearance â but what a splendid one!&quot; (1975)

Other Arlott quotes:
&quot;Australianism&#x27; means single-minded determination to win â to win within the laws but, if necessary, to the last limit within them. It means where the &#x27;impossible&#x27; is within the realm of what the human body can do, there are Australians who believe that they can do it â and who have succeeded often enough to make us wonder if anything is impossible to them. It means they have never lost a match â particularly a Test match â until the last run is scored or their last wicket down.&quot; (1949)[15]

&quot;I&#x27;m going while people are still asking me why I&#x27;m going rather than thinking why doesn&#x27;t he go.&quot; (1980)

&quot;In 1980, Trevor Bailey and the writer were largely responsible for a fresh cricket commentary noise, the popping of champagne corks. The senior men and BBC representatives...have all been temperate men, not teetotallers but as a rule disinclined to take wine â or any other alcoholic drink â during the course of the working day...Latterly though, Brian Johnston has been coaxed round by way of Pouilly Fume to the occasional hock and now, fizz. The others have required little persuasion.&quot; (1981)

&quot;I owe almost everything to Neville. I remember reading &#x27;The Summer Game&#x27; when I was in my teens. Suddenly, my eyes were opened to this semi-mythology of cricketers and always said to Neville that any success I had was due to the imaginative stimulus he gave me.&quot; â his view of Neville Cardus.

===Memorable quotes about Arlott===
&quot;The very personification of cricket.&quot; Prime Minister John Major, 1991

&quot;He was cricket, there has never been a commentator like him and there never will be.&quot; Ian Botham, former England Captain, 1991

&quot;I think that he spread the gospel about cricket around the world more than anyone else.&quot; Brian Johnston, fellow commentator, 1991

&quot;A man of deep humanity.&quot; David Frith, editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly, 1992

&quot;He was generous with his time in the company of friends. I once sat down to Sunday lunch with John, his family and some friends at two o&#x27;clock, and we did not get up from the table until ten at night.&quot; Mike Brearley, 1992

&quot;Johnston provided the life, Arlott the soul.&quot; Paul Coupar writing about the history of TMS on its 50th anniversary 2007

<text>George Brettingham Sowerby III (16 September 1843 â 31 January 1921) was a British conchologist, publisher, and illustrator.

He, too, worked (like his father George Brettingham Sowerby II and his grandfather George Brettingham Sowerby I) on the &quot;Thesaurus Conchyliorium&quot;, a comprehensive, beautifully illustrated work on molluscs. He was colour blind, and thus his daughter did most of the colouring of his engravings.

<text>The Hellenic Football League, currently known as the uhlsport Hellenic Football League for sponsorship reasons, is an English men&#x27;s football league covering an area including the English counties of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, southern Herefordshire, southern Warwickshire, northern Wiltshire and southern Worcestershire. There were also teams from Berkshire southern Buckinghamshire, Greater London, Hampshire and Northamptonshire, Surrey until the 2020â21 season.

==History==
The league was established in 1953. In the 2000â01 season, the Hellenic League absorbed the Chiltonian League. The league now has a Premier Division and Division One as part of the National League System. The league also runs Division Two East, Division Two West, Division Two North and Division Two South below the National League System. In the 2006â07 season the Hellenic League absorbed the Banbury District and Lord Jersey FA Veterans League with three Divisions now under the Hellenic Veterans League title.

Starting with the 2004â05 re-organisation the Hellenic League became a step 5 and 6 league in the National League System. Premier Division clubs play at Step 5 level, which offers progression to the Southern Football League Division One (Step 4) for Premier Division winners who have the required ground status.

Hellenic League Division One teams play at Step 6 level, promotion to the Step 5 Premier Division can be gained by clubs finishing in the top two of Division One dependent on required ground facilities as specified by The Football Association. Acceptance to HL Division One is offered to teams playing in the various Step 7 county leagues of the related Hellenic League area.

38 teams play in the Hellenic Premier and Division One. 18 teams play at Veterans level (players aged 35 or over).

==Champions==
The league started with only a Premier Division, before Division One was added in 1956.

For the 1971â72 season, Division One was split into Division One A and B.

The following season, Division One A and B were merged and a Division Two was created.

The following season, Division One and Division Two were merged.

In 2000, the league absorbed the Chiltonian League and Division One was regionalised into East and West.

In 2021, Division One East and West were merged again. 
==Cup winners==
The Hellenic League football cups are the Supplementary Cup, the Challenge Cup and the Floodlit Cup.

<doc id="640543" wikidata="Q1437487" url="?curid=640543" title="Formula One regulations">
<text>The numerous Formula One regulations, made and enforced by the FIA, have changed dramatically since the first Formula One World Championship in 1950. There are two main types of regulations; technical and sporting. Technical regulations are related to car specifications, such as the chassis or the engine. Meanwhile, sporting regulations involve race procedures and set rules that pertain to the sport as a whole. This article covers the current state of F1 technical and sporting regulations, as well as the history of the technical regulations since 1950.

== Current rules and regulations ==

=== Technical ===

==== Chassis ====
An F1 car can be no more than 200Â cm wide and 95Â cm tall. Though there is no maximum length, other rules set indirect limits on these dimensions, and nearly every aspect of the car carries size regulations; consequently the various cars tend to be very close to the same size. The car and driver must together weigh at least 800Â kg as of 2025.

The car must only have four wheels mounted externally of the body work with only the front 2 steered and only the back 2 driven. The maximum distance allowed between the front and rear wheels (the wheelbase) is 360Â cm.

The main chassis contains a &quot;safety cell&quot; which includes the cockpit, a structure designed to reduce impact directly in front of the cockpit, and the fuel cell directly behind the cockpit. Additionally, the car must contain roll structures behind and ahead of the driver. The driver must be able to enter and exit the cockpit without any adjustments other than removing the steering wheel.

There are also mandatory crash test standards. There is a head-on impact into a steel barrier; &quot;average deceleration must not exceed 25g&quot;, with a maximum 60g for a minimum 3 milliseconds, with no damage to the chassis beyond the nose section. The same chassis must then sustain a rear impact from a sled travelling at , with no damage in front of the rear axle. The roll hoop is not permitted to crush beyond , and structural failure is only permitted in the top of the body. Side impacts by a object at must be decelerated at less than 20g, and absorb no less than 15% and no more than 35% of the total energy; can not be exceeded more than 3 milliseconds. The steering wheel must survive the impact of an -diameter object at with no deformation of the wheel or damage to the quick-release mechanism.

In addition, there are &quot;squeeze tests&quot; on the cockpit sides, fuel tank, and nosebox. The cockpit must survive a force with no failure; for the fuel tank, is applied. A maximum deformation is allowed. For the cockpit rim, the figures are and . The nosebox must withstand for 30 seconds without failing.

Onboard electrical and computer systems, once inspected at the start of the season, may not be changed without prior approval. Electronic starters and launch control are forbidden. The computers must contain a telemetric accident data reporting system.

Continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) have been banned since 1994, two weeks after very successful tests in the Williams FW15C in 1993 that proved CVTs had the potential to keep other teams at a competitive disadvantage for a long time due to the difficulties of designing sufficiently strong belts for use in CVTs. It was speculated that the use of a CVT alone led to an advantage of several seconds per lap. CVTs have never been used in Formula 1 races. A rule was added in 1994 that stated that gearboxes must have anywhere from 2 to 7 discrete gear ratios, alongside a clause that explicitly bans CVTs. Active suspensions were also banned in 1994 due to safety concerns by the FIA over ever-higher speeds, and other &quot;driver aids&quot; were also banned that same year, including 4-wheel steering, which was tested and found to provide negligible if any reduction in lap times.

Since 2014, transmissions with 8 gear ratios and 1 reverse gear ratio are required in Formula 1 cars.

==== Engine ====
2.4-litre V8 engines were used in the 2013 season. The engine technology was greatly changed from the 2014 season with the introduction of the 1.6-litre turbocharged V6-hybrid engine. The engine minimum weight is 145Â kg.

For the 2017 season, the fuel limit per race was increased to 105Â kg. For the 2019 season, the limit was again increased to 110Â kg. The power outputs of F1 engines have not been disclosed since the 1990s, however, the consensus is that the 1.6 L turbocharged V-6 engines produce 750 to 850Â bhp, depending on trims and mappings. Another radical change in 2014 was the introduction of the ERS (Energy Recovery System). This system works similarly to KERS, with drivers getting a full-time boost of about 160Â bhp from electric motors used in conjunction with the internal combustion engine (generating around 1,000Â bhp in total) instead of a 6-second bank of extra power per lap. The combination of these systems led to the term &quot;power unit&quot; being used in lieu of &quot;engine&quot;.

Devices designed to inject any substance into the cylinders other than air and fuel (petrol) are forbidden, as are variable-length intake and exhaust systems. The crankshaft and camshafts must be made of steel or cast iron. The use of carbon composite materials for the cylinder block, cylinder head and pistons is not allowed. Separate starting devices may be used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. If the engine is fitted with an anti-stall device, this must be set to cut the engine within ten seconds in the event of an accident.

The engines, now referred to as &quot;power units&quot;, are divided into 6 components: the internal combustion engine (ICE); turbocharger (TC); Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K), which harvests energy that would normally be wasted under braking; Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H), which collects energy in the form of heat as it is expelled through the exhaust; Energy Store (ES), which functions as batteries, holding the energy gathered by the Motor Generator Units; and Control Electronics (CE), which includes the Electronic Control Unit and software used to manage the entire power unit. In 2015, each driver was allowed to use up to four of each component during a season that is up to 20 scheduled races in length; a fifth power unit (and its components) could be used without penalty if more than 20 races are scheduled to take place. A ten-place starting grid penalty was applicable for the use of a power unit component used beyond the established allocation, and a pit lane start for the entire unit changes beyond the limit.

&quot;*Note&quot;: The density of fuel here varies, but is approximately between 0.7 â 0.77 g/mL. *(&quot;Figures above reflect that range.&quot;)*

==== Refuelling ====
From 2010, refuelling is no longer permitted during the race and now every car starts with a full fuel load. The 2010 season cars were about 22Â cm longer than 2009 cars to accommodate the enlarged fuel tank this necessitated.

==== Tyres ====

Formula 1 has contracted a single supplier of tyres since the 2007 season. The supplier (Pirelli since ) supplies 5 specifications of slick dry-weather tyres (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5), of which 3 compounds are provided at each race (as soft, medium and hard). From to , 2 types of dry tyres were provided at each race weekend, known as the Prime and the Option. Teams are supplied with more sets of Prime tyres than Option tyres for use throughout the weekend. The Prime tyre is usually harder and therefore more durable than the Option tyre, while the Option tyre provides more grip and therefore allows faster lap times when the tyres are fresh. At some events the selection is reversed, with the Option tyre being harder than the Prime. The combination of longer lasting and faster tyres adds an element to each car&#x27;s race strategy. Additionally, 2 wet-weather compounds are provided by the supplier: intermediate and full wet. From onward, 3 dry tyre compounds are brought to a race weekend. Since 2019, regardless of tyre compound, one tyre is designated as soft, one as medium, and one as hard. One set of the softest tyres is set aside for Q3 and two sets of the middle and the hardest tyres are kept for the race. Drivers select 10 sets of tyres for a race weekend. Each compound is differentiated by a colour-coded band painted around the tyre&#x27;s sidewall and including the supplier&#x27;s logo: red for soft, yellow for medium, white for hard, green for intermediate, and blue for full wet.

Competitors are allowed only a limited number of tyre sets during a race event: 13 dry, 4 intermediate, 3 wet. Each tyre must be marked with a unique identifier for tracking and scrutinising during a race event. During the practice sessions drivers are limited to the use of 3 sets of dry tyres, and certain sets must be returned to the supplier before the second and third sessions. From 2014 to 2021, if qualifying and starting the race on dry tyres, drivers who completed a lap during the third period of qualifying (the top ten) were required to start the race on the tyre set with which they recorded their fastest time during the second period. Any cars that qualified outside the top ten may have started the race on any remaining set of tyres. This rule was removed prior to the 2022 season. Cars must race on any 2 dry compounds during a race unless intermediate or wet tyres have been used by that car in that race.

Prior to qualifying, wet and intermediate tyres may only be used if the track is judged wet by the race director. Starting the race behind the safety car due to heavy rain requires cars to be fitted with wet tyres until they make a pit stop.

Heaters may be applied only to the outside of tyres.
=== Sporting ===

==== Parc fermÃ© ====
After weighing during each qualifying session, teams are required to take their cars to a place in the paddock, sectioned off by the FIA, known as &quot;parc fermÃ©&quot;; they may not do work on the cars, other than routine maintenance, until they are released from &quot;parc fermÃ©&quot; for the race the next morning.

If a team must do other significant work, body work or suspension adjustments, the car will start from the pit lane.

==== Race procedure ====


The pit lane opens forty minutes before the start of a race (tâ40:00), during which time drivers may drive around the track as much as they like, driving through the pit lane each time around in order to avoid the grid. Drivers must be in their cars and in place on the grid by time the pit lane closes at tâ30:00; otherwise they must start the race from the pits. Meanwhile, teams may work on their cars on the grid.

At tâ10:00 the grid is cleared of everyone except team mechanics, race marshals, and drivers. A team will generally want to keep its tyres off their cars and heated in their tyre-warmers for as long as possible, but they must be attached to the cars by tâ3:00.

Engines must be running by tâ1:00; at fifteen seconds to the start all personnel must be clear of the track. Green lights signify the start of the formation lap, also known as the parade lap, during which drivers must remain in the same order (no passing) except if a car ahead has stopped due to a technical problem, or has had an accident. The cars circle the track once, usually weaving from side to side to warm up their tyres, and form up again in their starting positions on the grid. A series of short, controlled burnouts is usually performed as each driver approaches their grid box in order to maximize rear tyre temperature and clean off any debris from the parade lap.

If, for some reason, a car cannot start the race (engine failure during qualifying or practice, suspension fails, etc.), the car can still join the race, but will take a 10-position penalty at the start. For example, if the car qualifies in 3rd, but has to change an engine at any point during the race weekend prior to the actual race, the car will start from 13th position. For strategy&#x27;s sake, teams will sometimes opt to start a car affected in this way from the pit lane. This means they start at the tail end of the grid; however, they can not only change an engine, but also start the race with fresh tyres.

Gearboxes must be used for five consecutive events (counted as P3, the qualifying practice session and the race). A 5-place grid penalty will be incurred if a replacement gearbox is used (Pole position becomes 6th).

The race is started by ten red lights in two rows of five (i.e. 5 columns of 2). The red lights in each column operate as a pair i.e. both go on and off together. The lights illuminate one pair at a time, left to right, in one-second intervals, and then go out simultaneously after a random interval (i.e. 4â7 seconds). When the lights go out, the race officially begins. Should the start need to be aborted for any reason, all 5 pairs of red lights will come on as normal, but instead of going out, the orange lights will flash. All engines are stopped and the start resumes from the 5-minute point. If a single driver raises their hand to indicate that they can&#x27;t start, the marshal for that row will wave a yellow flag, then after a few seconds, both the red and orange lights will extinguish and the green lights will come on to indicate another formation lap.(No overtaking in formation laps)

==== Scoring ====
The Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships are decided by points, which are awarded according to the place in which a driver classifies at each Grand Prix. To receive points a racer need not finish the race, but at least 90% of the winner&#x27;s race distance must be completed. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive some points even though they retired before the end of the race. In that case the scoring is based on the distance completed in comparison to other drivers. It is also possible for the lower points not to be awarded (as at the 2005 United States Grand Prix) because insufficient drivers completed 90% of the winner&#x27;s distance. The system was revised in 2003 and later amended for the 2010 season because of two new teams entering the sport. The scoring system from 2019 on is:

For scoring systems prior to 2019, refer to the List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems.

Drivers finishing lower than tenth place receive no points.

From 2010 until the end of 2021 championship, if the race had to be abandoned for any reason before 75% of the planned distance (but after a minimum of two completed laps), then the points awarded were halved: 12.5, 9, 7.5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5. The rules regarding the awarding of points were reviewed by FIA, teams and Formula One following criticism after the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, during which the race was red flagged on lap 3 after two laps behind the safety car, with no laps having been completed under green flag conditions at racing speed, before the race was abandoned prematurely, with the race resultâa win for Max Verstappenâbeing taken after the first lap. More than two laps were considered by the FIA to have been completed by leader because the leader Verstappen had crossed the control line three times before the race was abandoned.

Following this, the point allocation for suspended races was changed for the 2022 season. The points awarded follow a gradual scale system as follows:
*No points will be awarded unless a minimum of two laps had been completed under green flag conditions.
*If more than two laps are completed, but less than 25% of the scheduled race distance, points will be awarded to the top 5 on a 6â4â3â2â1 basis.
*If 25%â50% of the scheduled race distance is completed, points will be awarded on a 13â10â8â6â5â4â3â2â1 basis to the top 9.
*If 50%â75% of the scheduled race distance is completed, points will be awarded on a 19â14â12â9â8â6â5â3â2â1 to the top 10.
If more than 75% of the scheduled race distance is completed, full points will be awarded.
Additionally, the fastest lap point will now only be awarded if more than 50% of the scheduled race distance is completed. However, these rules do not apply and full points will be awarded when a race is suspended and then resumed, even if the whole race distance cannot be completed in the 3 hour race window. However, this was changed for 2023 thereby satisfying the original intent of the gradual scale system.

Points are awarded equally to the driver and their constructor; for example, if a driver for one team comes second, eighteen points are added to their season total; if their teammate finished third in the same race, they add fifteen to their total and the team adds 33 (the sum of the drivers&#x27; points) to its total. The championships are awarded to whichever driver and constructor have the most points at the end of the season. In case of a tie, the FIA compares the number of times each driver has finished in each position. The championship goes to whichever had the greater number of wins; if they have the same number of wins, it goes to the driver with the greater number of second places, and so on. For example, if drivers A and B were tied at the end of a season, and B had six wins and 3 second-place finishes, but A had six wins and four second-place finishes (even if they had fewer third places than B, etc.), then A would be champion.

On 10 December 2013, it was confirmed that drivers and constructors will score double points in the final Grand Prix from 2014 onwards, but this was abandoned in the weeks following the 2014 season.

==== Flags ====

Many venues make use of electronic displays to indicate flags to give various messages to drivers. However, race marshals continue to use physical flags as a redundancy mechanism in the event of electronic display failure. Marshals are positioned at numerous points around the track during every race. Flags have different meanings depending on their colour; the colours (with Pantone values as specified by the FIA) signify as follows:

Flags, whose specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the FIA&#x27;s International Sporting Code, must measure at least 60Â cm by 80Â cm, excepting the red and chequered flags, which must measure at least 80Â cm by 100Â cm.

==== Penalties ====
Penalties may be imposed on drivers for numerous offences, including jumping the start, speeding in the pit lane, causing an avoidable accident, unsportsmanlike conduct, or ignoring flags of any color. There are four types of penalty which a driver may incur for violation of on-track rules:

A time penalty is the most common type of penalty, and can last either five or ten seconds. It may be served during the next pit stop. After the driver stops in their pit box, mechanics must wait for 5 or 10 seconds before touching the car. Touching the car while the penalty is still in effect will result in another being added for serving the penalty incorrectly. If the driver did not serve their penalty in the pit lane, the time penalty will be added to their time at the end of the race.

A drive-through penalty requires the driver to enter the pit lane, drive through it while obeying its speed limit, and exit without stopping. As a drive-through penalty does not require the driver to stop, it is less costly than a stop-go penalty.

A ten-second stop-go penalty requires the driver to enter the pit lane, stop at their pit for ten seconds, and exit again. As the stop is designed to punish the driver for an offence, team mechanics are forbidden to work on the offending car at any time while the driver is serving the penalty. Stop-go penalty is the harshest penalty short of disqualification and is given for serious offences such as endangering other drivers. The most recent occurrence of this was at the 2024 Qatar Grand Prix, where Lando Norris was penalized for failing to slow down under double-waved yellow flags, caused by debris on the main straight, costing him around 35 seconds in race time.

For drive-through and stop-go penalties, a driver has 2 laps from the time their team hears of the penalty to enter the pits; if the driver does not pit within 2 laps, the driver will be black-flagged. The exception to this rule is if the Safety Car is deployed before a driver serves their penalty, in which case the driver is not allowed to serve the penalty until after the Safety Car comes back in. If the driver incurs a penalty within the last 5 laps of the race, the driver need not pit at all; instead, twenty seconds will be added to their total race time in case of a drive-through penalty, and thirty seconds in case of stop-go penalty.

The most severe penalty in common use is a black flag, which may be imposed for ignoring penalties or for technical irregularities of any sort; it signifies that the driver has been disqualified from the race and their results for that race will not count toward the championship. If the black flag is not considered sufficient for the offence that the driver has committed, the driver may be banned for a number of races after the event. For example, Romain Grosjean&#x27;s crash at the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix earned him a one-race ban at the next race. In modern Formula One, most disqualifications have occurred due to infringements found during post-race scrutineering; for example, Sebastian Vettel was disqualified from the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix due to insufficient fuel sample, and Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc were both disqualified during the 2023 United States Grand Prix due to excessive plank wear.

A grid penalty may be given for the next race, which may increase depending on the severity of a penalty. Grid penalties have also been given due to exceeding the quota of an engine component. For example, a 5-place grid penalty means if the driver qualified first, they would start the race from sixth position.

The most extreme punishment of all (used for seriously endangering the life of another driver or trying to gain an unfair advantage in the championship) is to be excluded from the drivers&#x27; world championship that year. Such cases may be taken to judicial court. The only time that this has happened was in 1997, where Michael Schumacher, at the final race, deliberately turned in on Jacques Villeneuve, damaging both cars and taking himself out of the race, though inflicting enough damage to Villeneuve&#x27;s car to slow him down.

==== Pit to car messages ====

There is no restriction on what information can be given to the driver, except during the formation lap.

Previously, to ensure that drivers drive the car &#x27;alone and unaided&#x27; and are not being &#x27;coached&#x27; from the pit wall, stricter rules were in place to govern what information could and could not be given to a driver over team radio. For example, it was not allowed for a driver to be given information about driving lines or how to adjust their car to make it faster whilst out on the track. These restrictions were removed at the 2016 German Grand Prix.

The primary reasons behind rule changes have traditionally been to do with safety and (mostly since 2000) to limit the cost of the sport.

<text>The Denver Gold was an American football franchise in the United States Football League (USFL) from 1983 to 1985. The Gold played their home games at Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado; and were co-tenants in the spring with the Triple-A Denver Zephyrs baseball team (Denver Bears prior to 1984).

==History==

===Holding fast to the USFL&#x27;s original blueprint===
When the USFL first organized, league officials identified Denver as a critical market. However, they had a difficult time finding an owner. Ultimately, the league&#x27;s first operations chief, John Ralston, got in touch with local real estate magnate Ron Blanding, an old friend from his days as head coach of the National Football League&#x27;s Denver Broncos. After some pleading, Blanding agreed to sign on.

Blanding was easily the poorest owner in the league. He held fast to USFL founder David Dixon&#x27;s original blueprint for the league, keeping tight controls on expenses (including player salaries) while heavily marketing the team in the Rockies.

The Gold&#x27;s original coach was Red Miller, who led the Broncos to their first-ever Super Bowl and had known Blanding for several years. Miller was still a very popular figure in the area; fans were still smarting at how the Broncos fired him after the 1980 season. However, Miller bristled at Blanding&#x27;s bargain-basement approach to running the team. The players used rented cars from Rent-a-Wreck, some of which were in rather poor condition. They had to rely on bare-bones meals, traveled to training camp in old school buses, and only had 100 uniforms for the 120 men they invited to camp. Blanding also balked at signing any of the Gold&#x27;s first seven picks in the 1983 draft. It got to the point that an irate Miller once threatened to quit unless Blanding decided to &quot;act like a fucking owner of a professional football team.&quot;

===1983 season===
The Gold attempted to utilize some of the goodwill established by the more established Broncos by involving former Broncos players and coaches in the Gold organization for the Gold&#x27;s inaugural 1983 season. Miller stocked his Gold roster with a number of former Broncos players. He also tapped his former starting quarterback with the Broncos, Craig Morton, as his offensive coordinator. Morton became head coach after Blanding fired Miller in the middle of the 1983 season. Despite one of the toughest defenses in the league, a weak offense kept the Gold out of the playoffs in 1983. Blanding, however, was more satisfied with the fact that he actually turned a profit. He was also happy that the Gold led the league in attendance, with almost 42,000 fans per game. In part because of this, the league chose Denver to be the host of the inaugural USFL Championship Game.

===1984 season===

====1984 season recap====
After finishing the 1983 season making a small profit, the Gold went into the 1984 campaign with a bare-bones payroll. They did not sign any significant free agents or college draft picks and traded away two of their three starting linebackers during training camp. First they dealt RLB Kyle Whittingham (84 tackles, 3 fumble recoveries and 2 interceptions) in a package deal to New Jersey and then traded popular All-USFL LB Putt Choate, who had 178 tackles the previous year to the expansion San Antonio Gunslingers.

With one of the league&#x27;s lowest payrolls going into the 1984 season, the Gold shot out of the gate to a surprising 7â1 record and were tied atop the USFL along with the powerful Philadelphia Stars and Birmingham Stallions after 8 weeks.

However, the turning point of the season was a 20â18 loss at the Louisiana Superdome to the New Orleans Breakers on April 22. With starting QB Craig Penrose not dressed, the Gold dropped what would be the first of five consecutive losses. Their early success was attributed to an opportunistic offense and a bend-but-don&#x27;t break defense that seemed to overcome their personnel issues at linebacker.

During this time, Blanding put the Gold on the market. Unwilling to join his fellow owners in reckless spending, Blanding sold the team to auto dealer Doug Spedding for $10 million in April 1984. By some accounts, Blanding was the only USFL owner who got a net positive return on his investment. Spedding shared Blanding&#x27;s frugal approach to running the team; if anything, he was even more cost-conscious than Blanding. He ran the Gold out of one of his dealerships. Despite being rather eccentric (according to Morton and Blanding, he was notorious for opening players&#x27; mail), years later many former Gold players praised Spedding for holding fast to the original USFL model.

Over the second half of the season, Morton had a QB shuffle that saw him use four different starters in Penrose, Bob Gagliano, Fred Mortensen and rookie Ken Hobart at various points over the last nine games. The Gold went 2â7 down the stretch and finished out of the playoffs. Acquired from Jacksonville in May, Hobart made his first pro start on JuneÂ 8, a two-point loss to eventual champion Philadelphia, decided by a late field goal.

The offense ranked a respectable eleventh in passing and fourteenth in rushing among the eighteen USFL teams in 1984. Running back Harry Sydney was the main offensive weapon rushing for 961 yards and ten touchdowns to lead the Gold. Quarterback Craig Penrose tossed twelve TD&#x27;s and was picked fourteen times over eleven starts in fourteen appearances.

The Gold offense was centered around a short passing game featuring running backs Sydney and Vincent White making 44 and 37 receptions respectively to finish 1â2 in team receiving. WR Leonard Harris was the most effective wideout for the Gold catching just 35 passes but had whopping 18.8 average per catch. Former New Jersey General TE Victor Hicks caught 31 passes to lead the tight ends.

The most stable and effective part of the Gold offense in 1984 was the offensive line. Tackles Steve Rogers and Ray Wagner along with guards George Yarno and Greg Feasel and centre Tom Davis did a solid job opening holes and creating pass protection most of the season.

The defensive unit struggled off and on throughout the season and actually shifted from a 3â4 set to a 4â3 defense late in the year to compensate for their lack of quality linebackers.

To address some of their needs, the Gold acquired DE Dennis Edwards (who had 6 sacks in 1983), from the Los Angeles Express and former Dallas Cowboy DE Bruce Thornton from the Chicago Blitz in mid-March. Thornton would contribute 6 sacks for the Gold in his limited playing time over the last 13 games.

In June, the Gold also acquired another former Dallas Cowboys alum in LB Bruce Huther from the 3â15 Pittsburgh Maulers. Huther was the starting middle linebacker over the last few games.

With the departure of Choate and Whittington in training camp, the Gold were not able to convert linebackers John Bungartz, Greg Gerken and Kelvin Newton into effective everyday starters. By the end of the season Bungartz and Gerken were relegated mostly to special teams and Newton was released before the season finale.

The unit did, however, have a relatively strong pass rush with DE Dave Stalls (12.5 sacks), DE Calvin Turner (10 sacks) and Thornton (6 sacks) having solid seasons.

The Gold secondary was the most stable part of the defensive unit with CB David Martin being named to the All-USFL team as a punt returner and a cornerback on The Sporting News All-USFL team in 1984. Martin led the USFL in punt returns with a 13.6 per return average on 22 run-backs, scoring 1 TD.

The secondary had four players record more the 100 tackles on the season in Martin, SS David Dumars, FS Steve Trimble and FS Tom Sullivan â an indication of the softness at the linebacker position.

In mid-season, the Gold special teams took a hit when punter Steve Gortz was injured in a game on April 14 in Pittsburgh. Instead of signing a replacement for Gortz, place kicker Brian Speelman took over the punting duties and served in a dual role for the remainder of the season.

Morton was widely seen as a players coach and it was reported that Spedding expected the Gold to make the playoffs in order for Morton to keep his job. However, unable to overcome the 2â7 slide, the team finished 9â9, one game out of the playoffs.

=====Week 1: at Los Angeles Express=====
The Gold began their second season on the road against their Pacific Division foe, the Los Angeles Express at the fabled Los Angeles Coliseum which was undergoing a facelift in parts of the stadium in advance of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games scheduled for July 1984.

With under six minutes left in a 10â10 game, Gold QB Craig Penrose found WR Elmer Bailey in the end zone for a 6-yard scoring play to give Denver a late 17â10 lead. On the next series, Denver safety Darryl Hemphill picked off Express QB Tom Ramsey and returned it 42-yards for the major to quickly seal a 27â10 victory for the Gold.

The Express got on the board first when rookie K Tony Zendejas hit a 36-yard field goal 9:08 into the contest to give the host club a 3â0 lead after the first quarter.

Early in the second, Gold FB Bo Matthews plunged in from 1-yard out to give the Gold a 7â3 just 2:15 into the period. The Express, however, responded when starting QB Tom Ramsey threw a 12-yard scoring pass to WR Jo Jo Townsell in the back of the end zone to give Los Angeles a 10â7 lead with 4:04 left in the quarter.

However, the Gold quickly drove into Express territory on the last drive of the first half and setup K Brian Speelman for a 43-yard field goal with just 0:03 remaining in the half.

After a scoreless third quarter, the Gold blew the game wide open with under six minutes to go in the contest.

The Gold (1â0) travel to Tulsa to take on the Oklahoma Outlaws (1â0) next Saturday (Mar.3rd) while the Express (0â1) host the Birmingham Stallions (0â1) next Sunday (Mar. 4).

=====Week 2: at Oklahoma Outlaws=====
The Gold continued their two-game road trip to start the season in Tulsa, OK against the expansion Oklahoma Outlaws. Led by former Tampa Bay Buccaneers star QB Doug Williams, the Outlaws won their opener the previous week, 7â3 over the Pittsburgh Maulers.

After a scoreless first quarter, Oklahoma jumped out to a 7â0 lead when former Pittsburgh Steeler FB Sidney Thornton scored on a 7-yard scoring pass from QB Doug Williams with 0:28 left in the first half.

The Gold, however, struck quick again late in the third quarter when RB Vincent White scored on a one-yard plunge with 4:47 left in the third quarter. Just 2:25 later, RB Harry Sydney scored on a 13-yard scoring romp after the Gold recovered a botched snap by Outlaws&#x27; P Bob Boris.

In the fourth, the Outlaws tied the contest when Williams scored on a 1-yard keeper 1:24 into the quarter to tie the score at 14â14.

After the Outlaws turned over the ball on the opening kickoff in Overtime, Gold K Brian Speelman hit a-21-yard field goal just 0:31 into the extra period to lift the Gold to a 17â14 victory. The win lifted the Gold to a 2â0 record to start the 1984 USFL season and early possession of first place in the Pacific Division.

===1985 season===

====1985 season recap====
In hopes of getting into the playoffs, Spedding hired Houston Gamblers offensive coordinator Mouse Davis for the 1985 season. Rumors had actually abounded that Davis was coming to Denver for much of the latter part of the 1984 season. Davis was the chief advocate of the Run &amp; Shoot offense in the USFL and had implemented the system in Houston that helped make Jim Kelly a superstar.

Davis brought in former Chicago Blitz QB Vince Evans. Evans split time with Bob Gagliano, a 4th string QB under Morton. Neither QB was great running the offense, but good schemes by Davis and talent at the other spots shot the Gold up to 4th in the league in offense.

Unfortunately, just after Davis took over, the USFL announced that it would switch to a fall schedule for the 1986 season. Spedding was one of two owners (the other being Tampa Bay Bandits owner John F. Bassett) to vote to stay on a spring schedule, knowing that the Gold could not even begin to go head-to-head with the Broncos. His guess proved right. While the Gold had been one of the USFL&#x27;s attendance leaders, fans in the Denver area were not about to abandon the Broncos. Despite finally getting into the playoffs with an 11â7 record, the Gold&#x27;s attendance crashed from over 20,000 to 14,400 fans per game.

As a result, despite finishing second in the Western Conference, they were forced to play on the road against the lower-seeded Memphis Showboats under pressure from ABC. The network, who had considerable influence over the USFL due to the structuring of the league&#x27;s television contract, did not want the embarrassment of having a game played in a near-empty stadium. The Gold were shelled 48â7.

===Demise of the franchise and the league===

The Gold would have been in an impossible position even without their attendance figures falling through the floor after the USFL announced it would move to the fall. Staying at Mile High Stadium would have been a logistical nightmare, and no other stadium in the area was large enough or suitable enough for temporary use.

In hopes of finding a way out of a bad situation, Spedding announced in November that he planned to move the Gold to Portland, Oregon to take the place of the departed Portland Breakers. However, just three months later, Spedding sold the Gold&#x27;s player contracts to the Jacksonville Bulls. Although the move was billed as a merger, Spedding retained the Gold&#x27;s intellectual properties. He seriously considered joining Bassett&#x27;s proposed spring football league before Bassett&#x27;s failing health prevented that league from launching. Instead Spedding, Bassett, and the USFL as a whole were doomed by the ill-advised attempt to move the playing season to the fall in 1986 in direct competition with the more-established NFL.

The USFL&#x27;s high-stakes anti-trust suit against the NFL ended in an award of only US$3.00 to the USFL. The jury cited the league&#x27;s abandonment of Denver and several other major markets as one reason why it awarded the USFL only nominal damages. With no new funds to cover its high spending, the USFL cancelled its 1986 season and folded.

<text>The Cyprus College of Art (CyCA) is an artists&#x27; studio group, located in the village of Lempa on the west coast of Cyprus. It was founded in 1969 by the artist Stass Paraskos; the current director is the Cyprus-based artist Margaret Paraskos.

== History ==
The Cyprus College of Art was founded in 1969 by the Cypriot painter Stass Paraskos, and is one of the oldest art institutions on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. In the past it has been housed at different locations. It started life in the city of Famagusta on the east coast of Cyprus in 1969, but after a campaign by local hoteliers against the presence of impoverished artists and art students in a city increasingly focused on mass tourism, the College moved briefly to Larnaca in 1972, and then to Kato Paphos in 1973. With the arrival of the mass-tourism industry to Kato Paphos in the early 1980s, the local authorities there also asked the College to move and it was settled at its present site in the village of Lempa in 1985. In 2002 the College acquired premises in the city of Limassol, run alongside the studios in Lempa, and the Limassol operation moved to Larnaca in 2007, becoming the Cornaro Institute. This was separated from the Cyprus College of Art in 2014, and now operates as an independent organisation.

The original aim of the Cyprus College of Art was not to provide formal courses, but to offer artists and art students from different countries the opportunity to spend a period of time making art in Cyprus. However, in the early 1970s the college planned to launch the first postgraduate fine art programme in Cyprus, but this was delayed by the Turkish invasion in 1974, and did not start until 1978. With the establishment of this programme, the Cyprus College of Art became the first true art school offering in higher education programmes, on the island of Cyprus.

In 1985 Stass Paraskos was joined by his daughter, Margaret Paraskos, running the College. With the acquisition of additional premises in Limassol in 2002 the College launched several undergraduate fine art programmes. This included foundation, adult education and degree courses in painting, sculpture, photography and printmaking. Almost all of the programmes taught at the College followed a British art education model, and several were validated in the United Kingdom, although these validations were not accepted by the Cypriot government authorities. In 2007 the College&#x27;s Limassol site was closed, and teaching transferred to a new building in Larnaca which became known as the Cornaro Institute, named after the last Venetian Queen of Cyprus Caterina Cornaro. From this time the site at Lempa concentrated on postgraduate programmes, and that at Larnaca on foundation and undergraduate programmes. Both sites were also used to house visiting artists from around the world.

Following the death of Stass Paraskos in 2014, the Cyprus College of Art ceased to offer formal educational courses and de-registered as a college of education with the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture. The Cornaro Institute in Larnaca was separated from the College and became an independent institution, and the College in Lempa became a studio and residency centre for artists and art students from around the world.

==Foundation and ethos==

The foundation of the College in 1969 was highly unusual. Although Stass Paraskos had visited Cyprus in 1968 with the British poet Martin Bell, and met with the first President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios, to discuss opening an art school in Cyprus, the initial impetus for starting the Cyprus College of Art came from an informal discussion in a pub in the English city of Leeds, where Paraskos was a tutor at the Leeds College of Art. 
In this discussion it was suggested Paraskos organise a summer trip for the art students and tutors to Cyprus. Agreeing to do this, Paraskos started an annual event, which attracted students from other British art schools, and eventually grew into the Cyprus College of Art. This informal start led by artists remains a central part of the ethos of CyCA today, with artists rather than administrators still playing a central role in the institution, and stressing the freedom of the artist to be a creative being rather than under the control of academic bureaucracies.

==Sculpture wall and garden==

The Cyprus College of Art&#x27;s campus in Lempa is surrounded by a large sculpture wall and garden, open to the public. This was created over a period of over twenty-five years from 1989 by Stass Paraskos, together with many of the artists and art students who have visited the College. The wall is a major landmark and tourist attraction in the region, attracting visitors to the village to see sculptures of a King Kong-sized gorilla, a donkey known as &#x27;the art critic&#x27; and numerous other animals and human figures, as well as abstract elements. These are all constructed from found materials and cement.

==Controversy with Manifesta==

In 2005, the International Manifesta Organisation, based in the Netherlands announced that the art festival Manifesta 6 would be held in Cyprus in 2006. The Cyprus College of Art was initially enthusiastic about the prospect of an international art fair in Cyprus, publishing a supporting article in the College newsletter, &quot;ArtCyprus&quot; about Manifesta.

However a perceived unwillingness by the Manifesta organisers to engage with the College and the Cypriot art world resulted in the College becoming one of Manifesta 6&#x27;s fiercest critics. This was compounded by the Manifesta team claiming there was no functioning art school in Cyprus, a charge that resulted in CyCA dedicating an entire issue of ArtCyprus to attacking Manifesta, accusing the Dutch organisation of cultural insensitivity bordering on racism.

== Rebirth and development ==

The economic crisis that hit Cyprus in 2013 had a major detrimental effect on the finances of the College, resulting in falling student recruitment. Coupled with the death of the founder of the College, Stass Paraskos, in 2014, it was decided in 2014 to cease offering educational courses and return the College to being a centre for visiting artists. This resulted in the separation of the Cyprus College of Art in Lempa from the Cornaro Institute in Larnaca, and with the focus of the College now firmly on Lempa, work has begun with Lempa Parish Council on upgrading the facilities in Lempa to operate the site solely as an artists&#x27; studio complex. Following the death of Stass Paraskos, his daughter Margaret became director of the Cyprus College of Art.

<text>Karl Martin Sandberg (born 26 February 1971), known professionally as Max Martin, is a Swedish record producer and songwriter. He rose to prominence in the late 1990s with songwriting credits on a string of hit singles, such as Britney Spears&#x27;s &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; (1998), the Backstreet Boys&#x27; &quot;I Want It That Way&quot; (1999), Celine Dion&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; (1999) and NSYNC&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot; (2000).

Martin has written or co-written 27 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles; 25 of which he has produced or co-produced, an all-time record for the chart as of March 2024. His credits include Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; (2008) and &quot;Roar&quot; (2013), Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;One More Night&quot; (2012), Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Shake It Off&quot; and &quot;Blank Space&quot; (2014), and the Weeknd&#x27;s &quot;Blinding Lights&quot; (2019) and &quot;Save Your Tears&quot; (2020). &quot;Blinding Lights&quot; is the best performing song of all time according to the chart. Martin has written the second-most number-one singles on the chart, behind only Paul McCartney (32), having surpassed John Lennon (26) with his 27th number one in March 2024. Many of Martin&#x27;s hits were used in the 2019 jukebox musical &quot;&amp; Juliet&quot;.

In early 2019, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; tallied his singles sales at over 135 million copies.

According to &quot;Variety&quot;, his net worth was approximately $260Â million in 2017; the previous year, his corporate entity generated revenue of $54Â million with a profit of $19Â million. Martin has won the ASCAP Songwriter of the Year award for a record of 11 times. He has also won five Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year, and nominations for an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards.

==Life and career==
===Early career and It&#x27;s Alive===
Sandberg was born and grew up in Stenhamra, EkerÃ¶ Municipality, Stockholm County. His mother was a middle school teacher and his father was a police officer. As a child, Martin was a student of Sweden&#x27;s public music-education scheme, and once said he had &quot;public music education to thank for everything&quot;.

As a teenager he sang in a variety of bands before joining a glam-style metal band called It&#x27;s Alive in 1985 as their singer and frontman. It&#x27;s Alive was formed by Peter Kahm and ex-Lazy members Per Aldeheim and Kim BjÃ¶rkgren on guitars, and John Rosth who had been a member of Lineout. Martin eventually dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music with his band under the nickname &quot;Martin White&quot;. In 1988 It&#x27;s Alive participated in Rock-SM (English: Swedish Rock Championship), a nationwide battle of the bands, and had a residency at a nightclub in Cyprus. The band got a breakthrough in 1991, as Dave Constable of Megarock Records offered them to make a demo record. The later debut album was originally pressed in 1,000 copies and later on given away as a free cover tape in the UK by the &quot;Metal Forces&quot; magazine.

The decision to focus on a music career paid off as they landed a record deal on producer Denniz Pop&#x27;s label Cheiron Records, a BMG affiliate. After recording their second album &quot;Earthquake Visions&quot;, they released three singles in conjunction with the record and toured through Europe in 1994 supporting Kingdom Come. &quot;Earthquake Visions&quot; eventually sold a disappointing 30,000 copies, despite being released in as many as 30 countries. More importantly though, Martin also began collaborating on songs with Denniz Pop. Recognizing a talent for writing pop songs in the young rocker, Denniz Pop renamed his new protÃ©gÃ© Max Martin and eventually became Martin&#x27;s mentor.

===Working with Cheiron and Denniz PoP===
In 1993, Martin was hired by Cheiron Studios and spent some time learning the basics, before the first production collaboration between PoP and Martin: the Rednex song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; in 1994. When Martin produced the intro to E-Types song &quot;This Is the Way&quot; E-Type and PoP credited it to the made up producer alias &quot;Max Martin&quot;, thus inventing his artist name. Martin was informed after-the-fact, when the printed records came back. They both worked on Ace of Base&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Bridge&quot; (1995), shortly thereafter, as well as on albums by 3T, Army of Lovers and Leila K. To date, &quot;The Bridge&quot; has sold more than six million copies worldwide, including one million in the United States. When Martin eventually left his band It&#x27;s Alive in late 1995, he was replaced by Anders Hansson.

In 1995, Cheiron Studios was hired by Zomba to work on Backstreet Boys&#x27; self-titled debut album &quot;Backstreet Boys&quot; (1996). Zomba became the main working partner since the success in 1995. Martin took part in the production of &quot;Quit Playing Games (with My Heart)&quot; (1996), co-written with Herbie Crichlow, a single which quickly went platinum and climbed to No.Â 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as the singles &quot;As Long As You Love Me&quot; (1997) and &quot;Everybody (Backstreet&#x27;s Back)&quot; (1997). The album was not released in the U.S. until 1997, but was released overseas and caught on all across Europe, eventually selling around 8Â million copies worldwide. This led to the Backstreet Boys being relaunched in their home country later on, this time more successfully. Later that year, Martin co-wrote and co-produced Robyn&#x27;s hits &quot;Show Me Love&quot; and &quot;Do You Know (What It Takes)&quot; which ended up on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 10.

In 1998, Cheiron Productions worked on albums by Five and Jessica Folcker. Jessica Folcker had first been hired as a backing singer for tracks with Ace of Base and Dr. Alban, and her debut album &quot;Jessica&quot; became an instant hit with singles like &quot;Tell Me What You Like&quot; and &quot;How Will I Know Who You Are&quot; which both sold platinum. After Denniz PoP died of cancer that same summer, Martin took over as director of Cheiron Studios. He soon started working with writer/producer Rami Yacoub, who continued to be his partner for many years. Martin also wrote two songs with Bryan Adams during this time, &quot;Cloud Number Nine&quot; and &quot;Before The Night Is Over&quot;.

In late 1999, Celine Dion released &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot;, a song co-written by Max Martin to promote her greatest hits album &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song.&quot; The song became a hit, going to number 1 on the adult contemporary charts in the United States and Canada, and reaching top 10 all over the world. Since the song was released in November 1999, it has cycled 500,000 times on almost 1400 radio stations across Canada and the U.S.
In 2003 Martin co-wrote and produced three songs for Dion&#x27;s album &quot;One Heart.&quot; One of them, called &quot;Faith&quot;, was released in 2003 as a promotional single in Canada and reached number 4 on the Quebec Airplay Chart and number 37 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart.

Martin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub wrote Westlife&#x27;s song &quot;I Need You&quot; for the first Westlife album &quot;Westlife&quot; (1999). Martin, Nick Jarl, Steve Mac, and Patric Jonsson wrote Westlife&#x27;s song &quot;You Make Me Feel&quot; for their second album &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (2000). Max Martin, Rami Yacoub, and Andreas Carlsson also wrote one of Westlife&#x27;s hits, &quot;When You&#x27;re Looking Like That&quot;, for their second album &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (2000).

===Backstreet Boys===
Martin wrote, co-wrote, and co-produced 7 out of the 12 songs on the Backstreet Boys&#x27; third album &quot;Millennium&quot; (1999), including all the singles. &quot;I Want It That Way&quot;, a hit song Martin co-wrote with Andreas Carlsson and co-produced with Kristian Lundin, became the group&#x27;s biggest single to date and it is still popular today, being voted No. 10 in the MTV/Rolling Stone list of the &quot;100 Greatest Pop Songs&quot;. &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;90s&quot;, a VH1 special, ranked the song at number 3, making it the highest ranked boy-band single and pop song. &quot;Millennium&quot; sold over 1.1Â million units in its first week in the United States, setting a record for most albums sold in its debut week (that record was later beaten by NSYNC&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;), and was the best-selling album in the world.

When working on her own solo album, to be released in 2001 on Stockholm Records, Lisa Miskovsky wrote the lyrics for the Backstreet Boys&#x27; hit single &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot; with Max Martin and Rami. The song, originally written for Miskovsky&#x27;s own album, was passed on to the Backstreet Boys by Max Martin when Miskovsky decided that it did not fit her style. The song became the first single off the group&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot; (2000). In the first week of release, &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot; immediately jumped into the Top Five in Sweden, Norway, Canada, Germany and another 15 countries. &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot;, containing several songs produced and written by Martin, sold 1.6Â million units in its first week in America. Martin again received ASCAP&#x27;s award &quot;Songwriter of the Year&quot; both in 2000 and 2001. In April 2013 the Backstreet Boys member Brian Littrell invited Martin to collaborate on their single &quot;In A World Like This&quot;. The single peaked at &quot;No.6&quot; in the &quot;Oricon&quot; chart and performed well in the rest of the world. Martin collaborated on the &quot;Never Gone&quot; songs &quot;Climbing the Walls&quot;, &quot;Just Want You to Know&quot;, &quot;Siberia&quot; and &quot;I Still...&quot;. Martin wanted the album to be more of a contemporary, alternative pop album with a little R&amp;B. The resulting album had a more organic music style with more live instruments, and was a departure from the Backstreet Boys&#x27; earlier work.

===Britney Spears===

In 1998, Martin wrote and co-produced Spears&#x27; debut single, &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;, for her debut album of the same name. The single was originally offered to the Backstreet Boys and TLC, though both passed on the song. That same year, Martin also co-wrote and co-produced the third single &quot;(You Drive Me) Crazy&quot;. By 1999, the album &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; had sold over 15Â million copies in the U.S., certifying Diamond Status. Also, within a year of its release, &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; had become the best-selling LP by a teenager in history, selling over 30Â million copies. Martin was the first non-American citizen ever to win ASCAP&#x27;s prestigious award &quot;Songwriter of the Year&quot; in 1999, an award he also won in 2000 and 2001.

Martin worked on Spears&#x27;s follow-up records &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot; (2000) and &quot;Britney&quot; (2001). He co-wrote and co-produced the singles &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot; (2000), &quot;Lucky&quot; (2000), &quot;Stronger&quot; (2000), &quot;Overprotected&quot; (2001), and &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot; (2002). The duo ended up parting ways when Spears distanced herself from teen pop. Spears recorded &quot;In the Zone&quot; (2003) and &quot;Blackout&quot; (2007). At the request of Spears, Martin produced and wrote for Spears&#x27; sixth studio album &quot;Circus&quot; (2008). Martin co-wrote and produced the provocatively titled electro pop song, &quot;If U Seek Amy&quot;, which was chosen by fans to be the third single of the album. Martin then produced the number one hit, &quot;3&quot;, for Spears&#x27; compilation album &quot;The Singles Collection&quot; (2009).

Martin was one of the executive producers of Spears&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; (2011) alongside Dr. Luke. He produced several songs for the album, including the successful singles &quot;Hold It Against Me&quot;, &quot;Till the World Ends&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Go&quot;, and &quot;Criminal&quot;.

===Startup of Maratone===
Following the death of Denniz PoP, Cheiron Studios was closed down in 2000. Martin and Tom Talomaa then started a new production company named Maratone in January 2001 and moved into the famous Cosmos Studios building. The first songs to be written and produced at Maratone were four tracks for Britney Spears&#x27;s album &quot;Britney&quot; (2001). The Maratone production crew initially consisted of producers/songwriters Max Martin, Rami, Alexandra, Arnthor Birgisson and Shellback. Following the work with Celine Dion on the album &quot;One Heart&quot; in 2003, few new hits appeared from Maratone until 2005.

In 2004, Kelly Clarkson traveled to Sweden to collaborate with Martin and Dr. Luke on her second studio album, &quot;Breakaway&quot;. These collaborations resulted in the rock-influenced singles &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; (2004) and &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot; (2005). In 2009, Martin co-wrote Clarkson&#x27;s single &quot;My Life Would Suck Without You&quot;, which was a number one hit.

In 2005, Martin collaborated with the Norwegian singer Marion Raven for the release of her debut album, titled &quot;Here I Am,&quot; writing and co-writing the songs &quot;Break You&quot;, &quot;End of Me&quot;, &quot;Here I Am&quot;, &quot;Little By Little&quot;, &quot;In Spite of Me&quot;, and &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;.

===Pink===
Martin co-wrote and produced three songs on Pink&#x27;s platinum-selling album &quot;I&#x27;m Not Dead&quot;, including the singles, &quot;U + Ur Hand&quot; (2006), &quot;Who Knew&quot; (2006), and &quot;Cuz I Can&quot; (2007). Martin also collaborated with Pink for her next album, &quot;Funhouse&quot; (2008). Martin co-wrote the first smash hit single, &quot;So What&quot; (2008), plus the singles &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Leave Me&quot; (2009) and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe You&quot; (2009). The duo wrote &quot;Whataya Want From Me&quot; during the sessions for &quot;Funhouse&quot;, but ultimately the song was recorded and released as a single by Adam Lambert. Later, Martin co-wrote hits for Pink including &quot;Raise Your Glass&quot; (2010), &quot;Fuckin&#x27; Perfect&quot; (2011), and &quot;Just like Fire&quot; (2016), for various Pink-related projects. For her seventh studio album, &quot;Beautiful Trauma&quot; (2017), he co-wrote &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;Whatever You Want&quot;, &quot;For Now&quot;, and &quot;Secrets&quot;. In 2019, for her eighth studio album, &quot;Hurts 2B Human&quot; (2019), he co-wrote &quot;(Hey Why) Miss You Sometime&quot;.

===Usher===
In 2010, Martin co-wrote and co-produced Usher&#x27;s song &quot;DJ Got Us Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot; that went number-one on the US Rhythmic charts and top-ten on the main Hot 100. Working together again, Martin co-wrote and co-produced on Usher&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Looking 4 Myself&quot; in 2012 making the dance-pop song &quot;Scream&quot; that went number-one on the US Dance Club Songs chart and number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

===Avril Lavigne===
Martin worked with Avril Lavigne on two songs, &quot;Alone&quot; and &quot;I Will Be&quot;, which were released on some deluxe editions of Lavigne&#x27;s third studio album &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot; (2007). Martin also worked on four songs for Lavigne&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot; (2011): the three singles &quot;What the Hell&quot; (2011), &quot;Smile&quot; (2011), and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (2011), and the album track &quot;I Love You&quot;.

===Jessie J===
Max Martin first worked with Jessie J on her international hit &quot;Domino&quot;, which achieved top ten success in countries including Canada and Australia. Following the success of &quot;Domino&quot;, Martin co-produced &quot;Bang Bang&quot; (2014) for Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.

===Katy Perry===
Max Martin is also responsible for some of the songs of Katy Perry: On her second album &quot;One of the Boys&quot; (2008), including the number-one single &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;, and top 5 hit single &quot;Hot n Cold&quot;, and following-up album &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; (2010), including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 numbers-one hit singles &quot;California Gurls&quot; (2010), &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; (2010), &quot;E.T.&quot; (2011),&quot;Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)&quot; (2011) and the Hot 100 top ten hit &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; (2011). Martin also co-wrote the songs &quot;Part of Me&quot; (2012) and &quot;Wide Awake&quot; (2012), the former of which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. For her fourth album &quot;Prism&quot; (2013), he co-wrote the No. 1 singles &quot;Roar&quot; (2013) and &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (2013).

Both songs reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance/club chart.

Martin has collaborated with Taylor Swift on three of her albums. Their first collaboration was the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number 1 hit &quot;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together&quot; (2012) for her album &quot;Red&quot; (2012).

The former three songs reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Martin later worked with Swift on &quot;Reputation&quot; (2017), co-writing and co-producing eight songs, including the singles &quot;...Ready for It?&quot;, &quot;End Game&quot;, and &quot;Delicate&quot;. Swift released her re-recorded albums &quot;Red (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot; (2021) and &quot;1989 (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot; (2023), which Martin co-produced multiple songs from these albums in 2012 and 2014. He didn&#x27;t handle the production of the re-recorded songs. He co-wrote a song called &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;, one of the newly added &quot;From the Vault&quot; tracks from &quot;Red (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot;.

Martin co-wrote and produced three songs from the Weeknd&#x27;s sophomore album, &quot;Beauty Behind the Madness (2015)&quot;, namely &quot;Can&#x27;t Feel My Face&quot;âwhich peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100â&quot;In the Night&quot; and &quot;Shameless&quot;. He co-wrote and produced four songs (&quot;Rockin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Love To Lay&quot;, &quot;A Lonely Night&quot;, and &quot;Ordinary Life&quot;) from the Weeknd&#x27;s third album, &quot;Starboy&quot; (2016). He contributed &quot;Hardest to Love&quot;, &quot;Scared to Live&quot;, &quot;Blinding Lights&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Save Your Tears&quot; to the Weeknd&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;After Hours&quot; (2020). The latter album was both a critical and commercial success. 

Martin also co-wrote and assisted in the production of &quot;Take My Breath&quot;, released in August 2021. He also produced or co produced the majority of the songs on the Weeknd&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Dawn FM&quot; (2022).

Martin appears on The Weeknd&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Hurry Up Tomorrow&quot; (2025), co-writing and/or producing the songs &quot;Open Hearts&quot;, &quot;Give Me Mercy&quot;, &quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;Society&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot;, and discarded lead single &quot;Dancing in the Flames&quot;.

===Coldplay===
Martin appeared as a keyboardist on two singles from Coldplay&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Everyday Life&quot; (2019): &quot;Orphans&quot; and &quot;Champion of the World&quot;. In June 2021, Coldplay announced their ninth studio album &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; (2021), with Martin serving as the album&#x27;s producer. The album received mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, debuting at the top of the UK Albums Chart and becoming the album with most sales in a week in the United Kingdom since Ed Sheeran&#x27;s &quot;No.6 Collaborations Project&quot; (2019).

&quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; (2021) included songs such as &quot;Higher Power&quot;, &quot;Let Somebody Go&quot;, which Selena Gomez appears on, and &quot;My Universe&quot;, which BTS appears on. &quot;My Universe&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, giving Martin his twenty fifth number one as a writer and twenty third number one as a producer on the chart. With that song, he tied with George Martin for producer with most &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number ones. (He would later pass Martin.) He recently co-wrote and co-produced a majority of their 2024 studio album &quot;Moon Music&quot;.

The song was certified 6x platinum in Australia; 3Ã platinum in the United States; 2x platinum in New Zealand, Spain, and the United Kingdom; platinum in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Switzerland; and gold in Brazil, France, Japan, and the Netherlands.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
When accepting the Polar Music Prize, Martin highlighted ABBA, Kiss, Prince and Lasse Holm as inspirations.

===Creative process===
The traditional division of work in the record industry often has the artist or songwriter writing the songs and then hiring a producer to help shape the sound. But at Cheiron, it was the other way around; the producers wrote the songs, played the instruments, and engineered and mixed the recordings, and the artist was only brought in near the end of the process to do the vocals. For example, on Britney Spears&#x27;s second album &quot;Oops!â¦ I Did It Again&quot; (2000), Cheiron had already written seven songs and had proceeded to record the layers of music before Britney even arrived at the studios in early November 1999. It took her only one week to do the vocals. Martin and his team worked more like a band that alternated singers. Martin explained his working method:
==Legacy==
Martin&#x27;s influence on the music field is also seen in the effect he has had on co-producers. The music site &quot;Stereogum&quot; singles out three people as his &quot;disciples&quot;, Savan Kotecha, Dr. Luke, and Shellback. &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that &quot;There&#x27;s a cluster of high-powered songwriters who are based in Sweden, and the grandmaster is Max Martin and that when Kotecha worked with One Direction he credited Martin&#x27;s influence: &quot;We work melody first. That&#x27;s Max Martin&#x27;s school. We&#x27;ll spend days, sometimes weeks, challenging the melody. The goal is to make it sound like anyone can do this, but it&#x27;s actually very difficult. In Sweden, you don&#x27;t do anything until you do it right.&#x27;&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reported that Martin was Dr. Luke&#x27;s &quot;Swedish mentor and frequent collaborator. If Luke is the Skywalker of pop songcraft, Max is the Obi-Wan: the reclusive master. ...The vital spark in the musical emergence of Dr. Luke was meeting Max Martin&quot;. Dr. Luke himself says of the chemistry between him and Martin &quot;&#x27;It happened really fast. It was magical. â¦[Martin taught me that] Instead of making tracks for five thousand people, why not make tracks for a million?&#x27;&quot; The magazine for Sweden&#x27;s collection society STIM reported that Shellback became an &quot;apprentice&quot; with Martin acting as &quot;his mentor&quot; at Maratone Studios after 2006 when &quot;Max Martin saw something special in the young man from Karlshamn. Judging by the incredible success Shellback has had since, Martin&#x27;s A&amp;R skills are some of the best in the music business&quot;.

Martin&#x27;s song catalog was used in the stage musical &quot;&amp; Juliet&quot;, which opened on the West End in 2019.

==Personal life==
Martin met his wife, Jenny (nÃ©e Petersson) from MÃ¶rrum, around 2000 and they married in 2011. The couple have a daughter, born around 2001.

Martin lives in Los Angeles and in Stockholm.

<text>The Essex Senior Football League is an English men&#x27;s football league. It contains clubs from the Essex FA, Hertfordshire FA, London FA, Middlesex FA and the Amateur Football Alliance. It is a feeder league to Division One North of the Isthmian League and has a single division which sits at Step 5 (or Level 9) of the National League System.

==Founder members==
The Essex Senior League was formed in 1971 with nine founder members. The finishing positions for the 1971â72 season were as follows:

==Promotion and relegation==
The Essex Senior League states that a club must finish in the top 3 to be considered for promotion to the Isthmian League Division One North. However the process is governed by the FA Leagues Committee who regulate relegations and promotions throughout the National League System. As of the 2014â15 season FA rules for Step 5 divisions such as the Essex Senior League stipulate that the champions should be offered the first chance of promotion. If the champions do not wish to be promoted or are not able to meet the entry requirements for promotion then the 2nd or 3rd placed team may be considered for promotion. Under normal circumstances, only one club can be promoted from a Step 5 league (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the Essex Senior League) to a Step 4 league (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the Isthmian League Division One).

In exchange for the promoted club, the Essex Senior League would typically receive a relegated club from a Step 4 league. Relegated clubs of Step 4 leagues are allocated an appropriate league based on their geographical locations. Thus the Essex Senior League is most likely to receive one of the relegated clubs from the Isthmian League Division One North.

There was no relegation from the Essex Senior League into a lower league since there was no Step 6 equivalent to the ESL until the 2017â18 season. Leagues including the Essex Olympian League (Step 7) sometimes acted as a feeder league to the Essex Senior League but promotion and relegation between the two leagues was not automatic. A Step 6 division for Essex and East Anglia was announced in October 2017 to solve the relegation problem. Since 2018â19, the Eastern Counties League controls this new division.

==Essex Senior League Challenge Cup==

The Essex Senior League Challenge Cup is a knock-out tournament competed for by teams in the Essex Senior Football League. Brentwood Town and Basildon United hold the record jointly for the most cup wins, each lifting the trophy four times (Brentwood Town in 1975â76, 1978â79, 1990â91, 2006â07, Basildon United in 1977â78, 1993â94, 1997â98, 2015â16).
As of the 2017â18 season the competition is referred to as the &quot;Errington Challenge Cup&quot; in recognition of the league&#x27;s treasurer Margaret Errington who held the post for 26 years before dying in 2016.

<doc id="640580" wikidata="Q1078449" url="?curid=640580" title="Romberg's method">
<text>In numerical analysis, Romberg&#x27;s method is used to estimate the definite integral formula_1 by applying Richardson extrapolation repeatedly on the trapezium rule or the rectangle rule (midpoint rule). The estimates generate a triangular array. Romberg&#x27;s method is a NewtonâCotes formula â it evaluates the integrand at equally spaced points.
The integrand must have continuous derivatives, though fairly good results
may be obtained if only a few derivatives exist.
If it is possible to evaluate the integrand at unequally spaced points, then other methods such as Gaussian quadrature and ClenshawâCurtis quadrature are generally more accurate.

The method is named after Werner Romberg, who published the method in 1955.

== Method ==
Using formula_2, the method can be inductively defined by
formula_3
where formula_4 and formula_5. 
In big O notation, the error for &quot;R&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,Â &quot;m&quot;) is: formula_6

The zeroeth extrapolation, , is equivalent to the trapezoidal rule with points; the first extrapolation, , is equivalent to Simpson&#x27;s rule with points. The second extrapolation, , is equivalent to Boole&#x27;s rule with points. The further extrapolations differ from Newton-Cotes formulas. In particular further Romberg extrapolations expand on Boole&#x27;s rule in very slight ways, modifying weights into ratios similar as in Boole&#x27;s rule. In contrast, further Newton-Cotes methods produce increasingly differing weights, eventually leading to large positive and negative weights. This is indicative of how large degree interpolating polynomial Newton-Cotes methods fail to converge for many integrals, while Romberg integration is more stable.

By labelling our formula_7 approximations as formula_8 instead of formula_9, we can perform Richardson extrapolation with the error formula defined below:
formula_10
Once we have obtained our formula_11 approximations formula_12, we can label them as formula_13.

When function evaluations are expensive, it may be preferable to replace the polynomial interpolation of Richardson with the rational interpolation proposed by .

== A geometric example ==
To estimate the area under a curve the trapezoid rule is applied first to one-piece, then two, then four, and so on.


After trapezoid rule estimates are obtained, Richardson extrapolation is applied.

*For the first iteration the two piece and one piece estimates are used in the formula . The same formula is then used to compare the four piece and the two piece estimate, and likewise for the higher estimates
*For the second iteration the values of the first iteration are used in the formula 
*The third iteration uses the next power of 4: on the values derived by the second iteration.
*The pattern is continued until there is one estimate.

== Example ==

As an example, the Gaussian function is integrated from 0 to 1, i.e. the error function erf(1)Â âÂ 0.842700792949715. The triangular array is calculated row by row and calculation is terminated if the two last entries in the last row differ less than 10â8.

 0.77174333
 0.82526296 0.84310283
 0.83836778 0.84273605 0.84271160
 0.84161922 0.84270304 0.84270083 0.84270066
 0.84243051 0.84270093 0.84270079 0.84270079 0.84270079

The result in the lower right corner of the triangular array is accurate to the digits shown.
It is remarkable that this result is derived from the less accurate approximations
obtained by the trapezium rule in the first column of the triangular array.

== Implementation ==
Here is an example of a computer implementation of the Romberg method (in the C programming language):
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

void print_row(size_t i, double *R) {
 printf(&quot;R[%2zu] = &quot;, i);
 for (size_t j = 0; j &lt;= i; ++j) {
 printf(&quot;%f &quot;, R[j]);
 printf(&quot;\n&quot;);

INPUT:
(*f) : pointer to the function to be integrated
a : lower limit
b : upper limit
max_steps: maximum steps of the procedure
acc : desired accuracy

OUTPUT:
Rp[max_steps-1]: approximate value of the integral of the function f for x in [a,b] with accuracy &#x27;acc&#x27; and steps &#x27;max_steps&#x27;.
double romberg(double (*f)(double), double a, double b, size_t max_steps, double acc) 
 double R1[max_steps], R2[max_steps]; // buffers
 double *Rp = &amp;R1[0], *Rc = &amp;R2[0]; // Rp is previous row, Rc is current row
 double h = b-a; //step size
 Rp[0] = (f(a) + f(b))*h*0.5; // first trapezoidal step

 print_row(0, Rp);

 for (size_t i = 1; i &lt; max_steps; ++i) {
 h /= 2.;
 double c = 0;
 size_t ep = 1 Â« (i-1); //2^(n-1)
 for (size_t j = 1; j &lt;= ep; ++j) {
 c += f(a + (2*j-1) * h);
 Rc[0] = h*c + .5*Rp[0]; // R(i,0)

 for (size_t j = 1; j &lt;= i; ++j) {
 double n_k = pow(4, j);
 Rc[j] = (n_k*Rc[j-1] - Rp[j-1]) / (n_k-1); // compute R(i,j)

 // Print ith row of R, R[i,i] is the best estimate so far
 print_row(i, Rc);

 if (i &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; fabs(Rp[i-1]-Rc[i]) &lt; acc) {
 return Rc[i];

 // swap Rn and Rc as we only need the last row
 double *rt = Rp;
 Rp = Rc;
 Rc = rt;
 return Rp[max_steps-1]; // return our best guess


Here is an implementation of the Romberg method (in the Python programming language):
def print_row(i, R):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Prints a row of the Romberg table.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 print(f&quot;R[{i:2d}] = &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;)
 for j in range(i + 1):
 print(f&quot;{R[j]:f} &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;)
 print()
def romberg(f, a, b, max_steps, acc):
 Calculates the integral of a function using Romberg integration.

 Args:
 f: The function to integrate.
 a: Lower limit of integration.
 b: Upper limit of integration.
 max_steps: Maximum number of steps.
 acc: Desired accuracy.

 Returns:
 The approximate value of the integral.
 R1, R2 = [0] * max_steps, [0] * max_steps # Buffers for storing rows
 Rp, Rc = R1, R2 # Pointers to previous and current rows

 h = b - a # Step size
 Rp[0] = 0.5 * h * (f(a) + f(b)) # First trapezoidal step

 print_row(0, Rp)

 for i in range(1, max_steps):
 h /= 2.0
 c = 0
 ep = 2 ** (i - 1)
 for j in range(1, ep + 1):
 c += f(a + (2 * j - 1) * h)
 Rc[0] = h * c + 0.5 * Rp[0] # R(i,0)

 for j in range(1, i + 1):
 n_k = 4**j
 Rc[j] = (n_k * Rc[j - 1] - Rp[j - 1]) / (n_k - 1) # Compute R(i,j)

 # Print ith row of R, R[i,i] is the best estimate so far
 print_row(i, Rc)

 if i &gt; 1 and abs(Rp[i - 1] - Rc[i]) &lt; acc:
 return Rc[i]

 # Swap Rn and Rc for next iteration
 Rp, Rc = Rc, Rp

 return Rp[max_steps - 1] # Return our best guess

<text>Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae (14 March 1821 â 15 August 1885) was a Danish archaeologist, historian and politician, who was the second director of the National Museum of Denmark (1865â1874). He played a key role in the foundation of scientific archaeology. Worsaae was the first to excavate and use stratigraphy to prove C. J. Thomsen&#x27;s sequence of the Three-age system: Stone, Bronze, Iron. He was also a pioneer in the development of paleobotany through his excavation work in the peat bogs of Jutland. Worsaae served as Kultus Minister of Denmark (the cultural and education minister) for Christen Andreas Fonnesbech from 1874 to 1875.

==Early life and education==
Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae was born in Vejle, Denmark in 1821. He was the fifth of eleven children born into a wealthy, educated family. His father was a civil servant (a county treasurer) for the County of Vejle and also a member of the Royal Society of Northern Antiquities.

Worsaae&#x27;s archaeological interests began in 1832 when his father gave him two stone axes, one which had been found on his land and the other having been found in the dredging of Vejle harbour. Worsaae was inspired; he began to search in on the east coast of Jutland before expanding his search area to include central and southern Jutland as well.

In 1835 whilst at school in Randers, Worsaae was invited to participate in an excavation of a grave at Bygholm, outside Horsens. Worsaae was also included in excavations near Jellinge the following year.

In 1838 he started studies at the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1841. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1869.

==Career and contributions==
While in Copenhagen for college, Worsaae began to work as a volunteer with Christian JÃ¼rgensen Thomsen, the first director of the National Museum of Denmark. He learned Thomsen&#x27;s methods of dating artifacts and controlled archaeological excavation.

Not wanting to continue working without pay, he found a patron in King Christian VIII. At the king&#x27;s request, Worsaae wrote an overview of the antiquarian field: &quot;The Primeval Antiquities of Denmark&quot; (&quot;Danmarks Oldtid oplyst ved Oldsager og GravhÃ¸ie&quot;), which explicated archaeology and the three-age system, was first published in 1843 in Denmark, and became widely popular. More than Thomsen, Worsaae reacted against the then-prevalent view of prehistory in Denmark. The historian Suhm identified the proto-historic period as the &quot;legendary age&quot;. He thought it could be studied from the Old Norse myths and legends. Suhm interpreted Norse gods and mythical figures as the kings and leaders of prehistoric peoples. Worsaae rejected this view of prehistory as euhemerism. He thought that prehistory was a period best studied not by historians, but by archeologists, who dealt with material goods. He believed that the knowledge that can be obtained about prehistory will necessarily be qualitatively different from the knowledge of historic periods, based on written texts.

Worsaae was working in a context of nationalist striving. In the mid-19th century, amid Danish-German political tension, the Norwegian scholar and nationalist Peter Andreas Munch provided the Germans with arguments for invading Denmark by suggesting that Denmark had originally been settled by Germans. But, Worsaae argued that the prehistoric peoples of the archaeological records could not be identified with any modern peoples because of the sheer timescale involved. Still, his work on Danish antiquities was taken to mean that natives had a long history in the area.

Similarly, when the HaraldskÃ¦r Woman, a peat-bog mummy was found in southern Denmark in 1843, she was exhibited as the legendary Queen Gunhild of the early Mediaeval period. Worsaae disputed this view, arguing that the body was Iron Age in origin, like most from the bogs, and predated any historical persons of the chronicles by at least 500 years.

King Christian sent him on a research trip to Britain and Ireland in 1846 and 1847, to study evidence of Vikings. He did research into antiquities and histories to develop an account of the culture around the North Sea. Worsaae wrote &quot;An Account of the Danes and the Norsemen in England, Scotland and Ireland&quot; (1852).

In 1847 Worsaae was appointed the Inspector for the Conservation of Antiquarian Monuments. He worked to preserve areas and directed excavations across the country. By controlled excavation and analysis of stratigraphy, he found artifacts that supported Thomsen&#x27;s Three-Age System, formerly based on the museum collection. Using Nilsson&#x27;s studies of prehistoric subsistence and the Danish geologist Johannes Japetus Steenstrup&#x27;s studies of changes in prehistoric forestation, Worsaae began to explore the limits of what can be known about prehistory. In that period of scholarship, those who could grasp the concept of prehistory were hard pressed to imagine that cultural developments could be discerned within the three ages. Through excavations of stone-age sites, Worsaae saw that there were distinct trends of coÃ¶ccurrence: a period with simple tools, signs of hunting and fishing, and with dog bones as the only evidence of domestic animals. This period was associated with the discovery of &quot;kitchen middens&quot;: enormous piles of waste produced by oyster-eating foragers. The middens were sometimes as large as ten meters high and a hundred meters long. Worsaae commented in his diary that &quot;these enormous piles of oyster shells must represent the remains of meals eaten by stone age people&quot;.

Worsaae determined that a second subset of the Stone Age deposits, associated with dolmen burials, showed signs of animal husbandry and agriculture. Following Nilsson&#x27;s analyses of prehistoric subsistence, Worsaae proposed that the Stone Age had a foraging period and an agricultural period, which could be demonstrated from artifacts. He also recognized that finds from caves in France predated even the Danish foraging stone-age period. He was perhaps the first to envision what became the division between Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. These were classified and named by the British researcher John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury in 1865.

As director of the National Museum of Denmark (1865â1874), Worsaae became the mentor of a new generation of archaeologists: including Sophus MÃ¼ller in Denmark. He was also a professor at the university. He supported archaeology as a science and influenced its study and excavation practices. He also influenced archaeologists in Sweden, where Nils G. Bruzelius, Hans Hildebrand and Oscar Montelius followed his lead. They further developed methods for establishing chronologies through controlled excavations. It was during his directorship of the National Museum that Worsaae&#x27;s large collection of antiquities from Denmark was purchased by the British Museum.

Worsaae&#x27;s early work, &quot;The Primeval Antiquities of Denmark&quot; (&quot;Danmarks Oldtid oplyst ved Oldsager og GravhÃ¸ie&quot;), which explicated the three-age system, was first published in 1843 in Denmark, and in English in 1849. It strongly influenced researchers in Great Britain and the United States. For instance, Lewis Henry Morgan, a pioneering American ethnologist, developed his own three-stage system of prehistory in his book, &quot;Ancient Society&quot; (1877). He theorized that prehistoric peoples went through progressive stages of &quot;savagery&quot;, &quot;barbarism&quot; and &quot;civilization&quot;, to be traced by several criteria, including their kinship and social structures, as well as tools and cultivation.

==Personal life==
Worsaae married Severine Jacobine Grevencop-Castenschiold, a member of the prominent Grevencop-Castenschiold family. They had two daughters: Jacobine Cathrine Margrethe Worsaae (1869â1951), the elder of the two, married the politician and Governor of the Danish West Indies Henri Konow. Her younger sister, Caroline &quot;Lilli&quot; Alvilda Nini Worsaae, died when she was just 22 years old.

Worsaae and his wife lived on his father-in-law&#x27;s estate Hagestedgaard for extended periods of time. He died there in 1885.

<doc id="640596" wikidata="Q2495783" url="?curid=640596" title="Universities UK">
<text>Universities UK (UUK) is an advocacy organisation for universities in the United Kingdom. It began life in the early 20th century through informal meetings of vice-chancellors of a number of universities and principals of university colleges and was previously known as the &quot;Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom&quot; (CVCP). As of August 2023, UUK is led by President Sally Mapstone â Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of St Andrews â and Chief Executive Vivienne Stern. UUK is registered charity with an annual income of Â£13.7 million, which is largely raised from its member institutions.

==History==
In 1918 the first consultative meeting of all vice-chancellors was held. At that time, the committee consisted of just twenty-two universities and university colleges. In 1930, under the chairmanship of Sir Charles Grant Robertson, vice-chancellors secured a mandate from their respective universities that &quot;it is desirable in the common interests of the United Kingdom to constitute a Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals for purposes of mutual consultation&quot;.

In the early 1960s, working parties set up by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals were responsible for the creation of the Universities Central Council on Admissions (UCCA).

In the early 1980s, they commissioned the Jarratt report, published in 1985, and which framed universities as businesses delivering a product to student-consumers.

Over the succeeding years the number of universities increased as a result of new universities being created and the change in legislation in 1992, which recognised the former polytechnics as universities thus doubling and diversifying the membership.

On 1 December 2000, CVCPâs name, logo and identity were changed to &quot;Universities UK&quot; in order to reflect changes which had taken place in the organisation in recent years.

==Mission==
Universities UK&#x27;s task is to support the work of universities and promote their interests. Its mission is to help UK universities be the best in the world, through their research and teaching, and the positive impact they have locally, nationally and globally.

Universities Wales and Universities Scotland work autonomously as part of Universities UK, representing the interests of universities in Wales and Scotland. They campaign, influence and develop policy on behalf of the higher education sectors in the devolved nations.

== Admissions and social mobility ==
In 2013, Universities UK funded &quot;Access for All&quot;, a report which supported work to widening access by promoting fair access and developing evidence to help universities learn from each other. It found that 34% of those who had achieved Key Stage 4 and expressed a motivation to go to university reported that the financial aspects of higher education, such as fees and living expenses, had made them think about not applying.

In 2019, Universities UK, in collaboration with the National Union of Students (NUS), published &quot;Closing the Gap&quot;, which investigated attainment gaps between students of different ethnicities at UK universities. The report was led by Baroness Valerie Amos.

== Advice regarding segregation ==
In November 2013, Universities UK published the document &quot;External speakers in higher education institutions&quot; which provoked controversy because it suggested that audiences might be segregated by sex to satisfy the demands of ultra-orthodox religious speakers. The guidelines follow the principle that segregation is permissible if the Equality Act 2010 is followed and equal priority is given to all groups, in a manner similar to the former &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine in United States constitutional law that justified racial segregation until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Following comments by Prime Minister David Cameron that universities should not enforce gender segregation on audiences, the case study which triggered this debate was withdrawn.

== Efficiency and effectiveness ==
The &quot;Efficiency and effectiveness in higher education&quot;, a report by the Universities UK Efficiency and Modernisation Task Group chaired by Ian Diamond, launched in 2011. In response to the report, the &quot;Efficiency Exchange&quot; was set up to help higher education institutions to share ideas and good practice. The Exchange facilitates the sharing of resources.

== Health ==
Universities UK&#x27;s health work programme addresses the NHS education reforms; research and innovation and AHSNs; healthcare employment and health education regulation. In 2012, &quot;A picture of health and education&quot; was published, which depicts the vital connections between higher education and healthcare.

== EU referendum ==
In July 2015, Universities UK launched a campaign in support of the UK&#x27;s continuing membership of the EU, which generated wide media coverage. This was criticised by some Conservative and UKIP Members of the European Parliament, who said that such political activity undertaken by a registered charity which is largely state-funded was wrong.

== Transparency==
In spring 2018, the transparency of Universities UK was widely called into question due to its role in negotiations over changes to the USS pension scheme, which led to the 2018 UK higher education strike. By 12 April 2018, 12,000 people had signed a petition demanding that Universities UK be made subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

During the 2018 UK higher education strike many elements of Universities UK were subject to strong critique. Bill Cooke, a lecturer at York Management School, submitted a complaint to the Charity Commission in relation to the governance of Universities UK, arguing that: &quot;UUK is lead adversary against tens of thousands of university lecturers and professional support staff. Yet its mission and Memorandum of Association claims that its purpose is to represent and speak for them and their interests, as member of universities.&quot; There were also criticisms of the miscommunications or misleading comments evident in various documents issued by Universities UK and its partner organisation Employers Pensions Forum, as well as analyses of the complex relationship that Universities UK has had with consultancy organisations.

<doc id="640597" wikidata="Q7943066" url="?curid=640597" title="Waldemar Milewicz">
<text>Waldemar Milewicz (August 20, 1956, Dobre Miasto, Poland â May 7, 2004, Latifiya, Iraq) was a Polish journalist and war correspondent.

==Life and career==
Milewicz obtained a degree in psychology. In 1981, he began working at the public Polish Television (TVP). In 1991, he transitioned to the news division, where he focused on producing television reports and documentaries. Through his work, he extensively traveled to conflict zones across the globe, including Abkhazia, Bosnia, Cambodia, Chechnya, Ethiopia, Kosovo, Somalia and Rwanda. Notably, his documentary series titled &quot;Dziwny jest ten Åwiat&quot; (&quot;This is a Strange World&quot;) propelled Milewicz to becoming one of the most recognized reporters in Poland. In 2003, he reported on the Iraq War while stationed at a Polish military base. Due to declining health, Milewicz had intended to conclude his career as a war correspondent after the Iraq mission. Tragically, he was killed in a drive-by shooting in Iraq by members of the extremist group Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad.

==Death==
On May 7, 2004, the Polish TV crew&#x27;s car was en route back to the Polish base camp in Najaf after conducting an interview with insurgents in Baghdad. They were traveling in a conspicuously marked press vehicle, closely trailed by a group of armed men in another car. Roughly south of Baghdad, the assailants caught up with them and launched an attack from the rear, unleashing a barrage of bullets upon the journalists&#x27; vehicle. Milewicz was the first to be struck, and he died instantly. In a subsequent volley of gunfire, Mounir Bouamrane, a veteran Algerian-Polish editor and translator who had served TVP for approximately 15 years, also died when he exited the vehicle. Meanwhile, the crew&#x27;s cameraman, Jerzy Ernst, was wounded in the arm by the second wave of gunfire while still inside the car, attempting to extract Milewicz&#x27;s body. The Iraqi driver and guide, Assir Kamel al Kazzaz, managed to escape the attack unharmed.

===Arrests===
In 2006, Polish military intelligence detained three men, following a tip from a rival Shia militia in the Baghdad area. The alleged killers of the Polish journalists were Kifah Hamid Asman, Alim Hussein, and their cell&#x27;s leader Salah Khabbas, a former Baath Party member who was later associated with al-Qaeda in Iraq. During his arrest, Khabbas offered a $100,000 bribe in exchange for his release. A suspect said that Iraqi Police officers, who had inspected the victims&#x27; car as they were leaving Baghdad, informed them of &quot;important people&quot; heading their direction. The detainees also confessed to several other attacks, including roadside bombings and kidnappings for ransom. They however later &quot;vanished&quot; after they were handed-over to the American and Iraqi forces.

=== Mistaken identity ===
On January 11, 2012, the newspaper &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; proposed a theory based on WSI archives discovered during verification. The theory stated that Waldemar Milewicz was killed because he shared a name with another Waldemar Milewicz, who was a member of along with Romuald Szeremietiew and BronisÅaw Komorowski, and then a board member of Cenzin, an arms trading company. His presence likely became known when he showed his passport upon arriving at the airport. The film crew members accompanying him were thought to be camouflage, and his murderers most likely had no photo with which to verify his identity. Waldemar Milewicz often traveled to dangerous regions to report, wearing no protection while performing his job in order to facilitate communication while interviewing.

==Honours==
Milewicz received many awards and prizes for his work, among them the SAIS-Ciba Prize for Excellence in Journalism by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1995 (for his work in Chechnya), the Polish Grand Press Journalist of the Year Award in 2001, as well as several state awards, including two Order of Polonia Restituta medals (Knight&#x27;s Cross in 2002 and Officer&#x27;s Cross posthumously).

<text>The Spartan South Midlands Football League is an English football league covering Hertfordshire, northwest Greater London, central Buckinghamshire and southern Bedfordshire. It is a feeder to the Southern Football League or the Isthmian League, and consists of five divisions â three for first teams (Premier Division, Division One and Division Two), and two for reserve teams (Reserve Division One and Reserve Division Two).

The Premier Division is at step 5 (or level 9) and Division One at step 6 (level 10) of the National League System (NLS) respectively. Division Two, at level 11, and the reserve divisions are not part of the NLS.

==History==
The league was formed in 1997 by the merger of the Spartan League and the South Midlands League. It is also known as the Molten Spartan South Midlands Football League after its sponsors.

<doc id="640604" wikidata="Q7602949" url="?curid=640604" title="Stass Paraskos">
<text>Stass Paraskos (; 17 March 1933 â 4 March 2014) was a British-Cypriot painter, sculptor, and writer. Born and raised in Cyprus, he would go on to spend most of his life working and teaching in England, where he famously became embroiled in a 1966 obscenity trial.

==Early life==
Paraskos was born in Anaphotia on 17 March 1933, the second of six sons of an impoverished peasant farmer. He went to England in 1953, working first as a pot washer and waiter at the ABC Tearoom in London&#x27;s Tottenham Court Road, then moving to Leeds to become a cook at his brother&#x27;s Greek restaurant. The restaurant became a popular haunt of local art students who encouraged Paraskos to enrol for classes at Leeds College of Art (later Leeds Arts University). Despite not having the usual entry qualifications to start a college course, he was spotted by the college&#x27;s Head of Fine Art Harry Thubron, who allowed Paraskos to enrol without the usual requirements. He became close friends with artists such as Dennis Creffield, Terry Frost, and Wilhelmina Barns-Graham, with the latter two persuading him to move to St Ives in 1959. He shared a studio apartment in St Ives with Barns-Graham until he returned to Leeds in 1961 to teach at Leeds Arts University.

==Obscenity trial==
In 1966, Paraskos was involved in a notorious court case, which became known as the Stass Paraskos Obscenity Trial, in which it was alleged he displayed paintings that were &quot;lewd and obscene&quot; in contravention of the Vagrancy Act 1838. The court case was one of a number of important legal challenges to the freedom of the arts in the 1960s and 1970s. Despite luminaries of the art world speaking in Paraskos&#x27; defence, including Sir Herbert Read and Norbert Lynton, and messages of support from Britain&#x27;s Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, he lost the trial and was fined Â£25.

The curator of a retrospective exhibition of Paraskos&#x27; work held in Leeds in 2009, Terence Jones, was quoted as saying, &quot;Ironically the painting in question now hangs in the Tate. When you see it, you do wonder what all the fuss was about. It&#x27;s quite an expressionistic piece in which you can see, just, a woman holding a man&#x27;s penis, but it is extremely tame when compared to what has happened in the art world since then.&quot;

Following this, Paraskos was invited in 1967 to take part in a group exhibition, &quot;Fantasy and Figuration&quot;, alongside Pat Douthwaite, Herbert Kitchen, and Ian Dury at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. Dury was later to become a close friend as they both began teaching at Canterbury College of Art in 1970. Paraskos became the last British artist to be successfully prosecuted for obscenity under the Vagrancy Act 1838. An exhibition recreating the 1966 Leeds exhibition was staged at the Tetley Arts Centre in Leeds in 2016 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the original exhibition and prosecution, and in 2021 the trial featured in the BBC television documentary, &quot;Forbidden Art,&quot; presented by Mary Beard.

==Teaching career==
Paraskos started teaching part-time at Leeds College of Art (Leeds Arts University) in the mid-1960s after returning from St Ives in Cornwall. He also taught at Leicester Polytechnic before becoming a lecturer at Canterbury College of Art (University for Creative Arts) in 1969.

When Canterbury College of Art was renamed Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design, Paraskos was appointed a Senior Lecturer in Fine Art and then Head of Painting, before returning to Cyprus in 1989 to run the Cyprus College of Art with his daughter Margaret Paraskos. Using his connections in the British art world, Paraskos was able to bring a large number of well-known international artists to the Cyprus College of Art, including Anthony Caro, Dennis Creffield, Jennifer Durrant, Terry Frost, Clive Head, Michael Kidner, Mali Morris, Euan Uglow, Rachel Whiteread and others, as well as many hundreds of art students from Britain and elsewhere, resulting in what John Cornall, writing in &quot;The London Magazine&quot; in 1996, called the discernable influence of Cypriot elements in British art during the period.

These visits by internationally recognised artists resulted in the Cyprus College of Art being held up as one of the cultural highlights of Cyprus by several presidents of Cyprus and other government ministers during the 1970s and 1980s. However, according to Parakos&#x27;s son, the art historian Michael Paraskos, Stass Paraskos believed he has deliberately snubbed by the academics at the University of Cyprus, after its foundation in 1989. Although Paraskos had received numerous assurances from Cyprus government ministers during the 1970s and 1980s that the Cyprus College of Art would form the nucleus of a new Faculty of Fine Art at the future University of Cyprus, on its creation he found himself sidelined by the new University authorities. According to Michael Paraskos, his father saw this as a personal betrayal by the government authorities, which pushed Stass Paraskos into taking an even more anti-establishment line in his art, writings and running of the Cyprus College of Art.

==Style and influences==
Paraskos&#x27;s style of painting is figurative but non-naturalistic, and he uses bright colours to describe scenes which often seem rooted in his childhood in Cyprus. He is also influenced by the Byzantine church art of Cyprus, and modern masters, such as Paul Gauguin and Henri Matisse. Works include &quot;Pagan Spring&quot; in the State Gallery of Contemporary Art in Nicosia, &quot;Lovers and Romances&quot; in the Tate Gallery in London, and &quot;Bathing,&quot; in the collection of the Arts Council of England.

According to Dominique Auzias and Jean-Paul Labourdette Paraskos&#x27;s paintings &#x27;illustrate Cypriot rural life, the tormented history of the island, love, life, death, always in a lyrical, romantic mode.&#x27;

Despite primarily being a painter, in 1992 he began work on an ambitious sculpture wall, in the village of Lempa, on the west coast of Cyprus. This wall is made of found and recycled everyday objects, and comprises a mixture of abstract and figurative forms, including a King Kong-sized gorilla, a pigmy elephant and a giant pair of welcoming hands. The wall is twenty metres long and up to four metres high, and forms a sculpture garden enclosing the studios of the Cyprus College of Art.

Paraskos was consistently a political artist, with left-wing and later anarchist sympathies. A member of the Communist Party of Cyprus (AKEL) in his youth, he used his art to look at subjects such as political and social oppression, the rights of women, and the horrors of war in Cyprus and the Middle East. This political activism went beyond his painting, with frequent articles by Stass appearing in Cypriot newspapers attacking what he saw as capitalism&#x27;s destruction of Cypriot culture, society, and the environment. He called the European Union-backed international arts festival Manifesta 6, scheduled to be staged in Cyprus in 2006, a &quot;capitalist plot to hijack and destroy what is uniquely Cypriot in our culture and replace it with a bland globalism&quot;.

==Artistic career==
Following his controversial exhibition in 1966 at the Leeds Institute Gallery, which was raided by the local police, Paraskos was invited in 1967 to take part in a group exhibition, &quot;Fantasy and Figuration&quot;, alongside Pat Douthwaite, Herbert Kitchen and Ian Dury at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.

His first exhibition in Cyprus followed a year later, at the Four Lanterns Hotel in Larnaca after which he exhibited regularly in galleries in both the United Kingdom and Cyprus. His published resume also lists exhibitions in Greece, the United States, Brazil, India, and Denmark.

In 2003 Paraskos was the subject of a book by the art historian Norbert Lynton, published by the Orage Press. His work is represented in the State Collections of Cyprus, the National Gallery of Greece, the Collection of the Arts Council of England, Leeds University Art Collection, Leeds City Art Gallery and the Tate Gallery (Tate Britain), London.

In 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Bolton for his services to art and art education.

In 2017 he was the subject of a major exhibition at Paphos Art Gallery in Cyprus as part of the city&#x27;s celebrations as European Capital of Culture.

==Writings==
Paraskos was a prolific writer, writing numerous articles, predominantly in Greek, for newspapers in Cyprus, collections of poems and books on Greek mythology, including &quot;Cyprus of Copper&quot; in 1969, and &quot;Aphrodite: The Mythology of Cyprus&quot; in 1981.

In the preface to Paraskos&#x27;s book &quot;Aphrodite: The Mythology of Cyprus&quot; the late George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy, a frequent traveller to Cyprus commented: &quot;Greek mythology provides an eternal fascination... Stass Paraskos, one of Cyprus&#x27; most distinguished artists provides in this book an exciting recital of the influence Greek mythology has brought to bear on Greek Cypriot development.&quot;

Paraskos&#x27;s &quot;The Mythology of Cyprus&quot; was published in Greek and Turkish translations in 2018.

==Death==
Paraskos died in Paphos on 4 March 2014, at the age of 81, following a bout of septicaemia caused by diabetes-related gangrene in his legs. He was survived by his daughter and fellow artist Margaret Paraskos. A street in the village of Lempa, the current location of the Cyprus College of Art, was named after him in his memory.

<doc id="640622" wikidata="Q5155209" url="?curid=640622" title="2004 Comorian parliamentary election">
<text>Parliamentary elections were held in the Comoros on 18 April 2004, with a second round on 25 April. The result was a victory for the Camp of the Autonomous Islands, which won 12 of the 18 elected seats.

==Background==
Following the previous elections in 1996, a political crisis had led to Anjouan and MohÃ©li seeking to secede from the Union. A 1999 coup led to Azali Assoumani taking power. A new constitution was introduced in 2001, decentralising power by granting autonomy to the three islands. Azali subsequently won presidential elections in 2002, which were boycotted by the opposition.

==Electoral system==
At the time of the elections, only 18 of the 33 members of the Assembly of the Union were directly elected in single-member constituencies. The remaining 15 were chosen by the legislatures of the three islands, Anjouan, MohÃ©li and Grande Comore, with each island electing five members.

The direct elections were held in 18 single-member constituencies using the two-round system.

==Campaign==
In 2004 there was only one national political party, the Convention for the Renewal of the Comoros led by Assoumani, which favoured more centralised government. Prior to the elections a loose coalition, the Camp of the Autonomous Islands, was formed by opposition groups organised by the presidents of the three islands.

==Results==
All fifteen of the indirectly-elected seats were won by the Camp of the Autonomous Islands.

<text>of Montreal is an American indie pop band from Athens, Georgia. It was founded by frontperson Kevin Barnes in 1996, named after a failed romance between Barnes and a woman &quot;of Montreal&quot;. The band is identified as part of the Elephant 6 collective. Throughout its existence, of Montreal&#x27;s musical style has evolved considerably and drawn inspiration from 1960s psychedelic pop acts.

==History==

===1996â1998===
Kevin Barnes founded of Montreal, allegedly naming it for a failed romance with a woman from Montreal, Quebec. Barnes was the only member of the group prior to their relocation to Athens, Georgia. There, they met Derek Almstead (Circulatory System, Marshmallow Coast, Elf Power) and Bryan Poole, who also performs as The Late B.P. Helium. Together, they recorded their debut album, &quot;Cherry Peel&quot;, and subsequent releases &quot;The Bird Who Ate the Rabbit&#x27;s Flower&quot; and &quot;The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy&quot;.

After production on &quot;The Gay Parade&quot;, the band&#x27;s third album, began in 1998, Poole left the band to focus on his involvement with Elf Power, another Elephant Six band. Barnes then recruited James Husband and Dottie Alexander, who had been performing together as Lightning Bug vs. Firefly. Almstead moved from drums to bass, and Marshmallow Coast&#x27;s Andy Gonzales joined soon after. Prior to the release of &quot;The Gay Parade&quot; in 1999, of Montreal released a number of singles and a re-release of &quot;The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit&#x27;s Flower&quot;.

===1999â2006===
Following the release of &quot;The Gay Parade&quot;, the band signed with Kindercore Records, and in 2001, the concept album &quot;Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse&quot; was released. 

Kindercore Records would fold shortly after the release of &quot;Aldhils Arboretum&quot;, and Gonzales and Almstead left the band. Barnes took to writing and performing their 2004 album &quot;Satanic Panic in the Attic&quot; mostly by themselves. It was released by Polyvinyl Records.

In 2005 &quot;The Sunlandic Twins&quot; was released.

===2007â2012===

Barnes recorded most of the band&#x27;s 2007 release, &quot;Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?&quot;, by themselves while living in Norway and Athens, Georgia. They also released a companion CD to &quot;Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?&quot; called &quot;Icons, Abstract Thee.&quot; In 2007, Kevin Barnes performed five songs nude during a performance in Las Vegas.

Of Montreal&#x27;s next album, &quot;Skeletal Lamping&quot;, was released on October 21, 2008. It was released in ten different formats, including conventional CD and vinyl, as well as T-shirts, button sets, wall decals, tote bags, and a paper lantern, the latter formats complete with a digital download code for the album. All items for the collection were designed by The Bee With Wheels (David Barnes) and Gemini Tactics (Nina Barnes). In an essay addressing the concept behind the album&#x27;s release, Kevin Barnes stated, &quot;We feel that there&#x27;s no reason to produce another object that just sits on a shelf. We only want to produce objects that have a function and that can be treasured for their singularness.&quot; In an interview with NPR, Kevin Barnes revealed that the concept of the CD may be going the way of the 8-track in favor of MP3 downloads. David Barnes joked that fans would buy the album via MP3 download and the version that comes with an amazing sandwich.

In August 2009, the band contributed a T-shirt design, which was printed and sold through the Yellow Bird Project website to raise money for the St. Judes Children&#x27;s Hospital. The shirt was designed by David Barnes.

During this era, the band lent its songs many times to commercials, television programs, and films. The song &quot;Wraith Pinned to the Mist (And Other Games)&quot; can be heard on radio and television commercials (with words changed) for an advertisement for Outback Steakhouse. Similarly, their song &quot;Every Day Feels Like Sunday&quot; was used in television commercials for NASDAQ. &quot;A Sentence of Sorts In Kongsvinger&quot; was used in a Comcast commercial. &quot;Gronlandic Edit&quot; was used for a T-Mobile commercial which also featured the band as actors.

Teaming up with Jon Brion, Kevin Barnes traveled to Ocean Way Recording to record &quot;False Priest&quot;.

On October 25, 2011 of Montreal released a Cassette Box Set of all 10 full-length albums via Joyful Noise Recordings. The release was limited to 500 hand-numbered copies, and housed in a custom-built wooden box (screen-printed with original artwork from David Barnes). Each of the 10 cassettes were pressed on multi-colored tape shells and included original album art. Like their previous cassette release, MP3 download was included.

Kevin Barnes had revealed some information on the following album in an interview with Pitchfork Media. On October 20, 2011, Barnes announced that the next album was complete. In November 2011, the band released a new track titled &quot;Wintered Debts&quot; via the band&#x27;s Soundcloud site, a track off the new album &quot;Paralytic Stalks&quot;. In January 2012, of Montreal released &quot;Dour Percentage,&quot; the first single from the new album. &quot;Paralytic Stalks&quot; was released on February 7, 2012. 

On November 12, 2012, the band created a Kickstarter page to help in the funding of a career-spanning, feature-length documentary called &quot;Song Dynasties&quot;. The film will consist of footage collected throughout of Montreal&#x27;s entire career, including touring and studio sessions, as well as other musicians such as Andrew VanWyngarden of MGMT. The tentative release window for &quot;Song Dynasties&quot; was announced as March 2013. An update regarding the documentary&#x27;s progress was posted on the band&#x27;s Facebook site in February.

===2013âpresent===
On April 25, 2013, of Montreal posted an announcement on their Facebook page stating that a new album titled &quot;Lousy with Sylvianbriar&quot; had been completed. The post went into detail about the album&#x27;s conception, including that Barnes&#x27; writing occurred while on a &quot;self imposed isolation experiment in San Francisco&quot; in early 2013. They were influenced by Sylvia Plath, the Grateful Dead, Neil Young, and the Flying Burrito Brothers in their writing. The album was recorded with a new lineup of musicians, including Jojo Glidewell, Nicolas Dobbratz, Bennett Lewis, and Bob Parins, with Clayton Rychlik and Kevin Barnes as the only returning members. The album and subsequent tour also featured Rebecca Cash on vocals. &quot;Lousy with Sylvianbriar&quot; was released on October 8, 2013. On July 10, 2013, the band released the first single from the album, entitled &quot;Fugitive Air.&quot; On July 31, 2013, they announced that they would be touring their new album in October and November. 
This tour featured the same musicians that performed on the album, instead of longtime band members such as Bryan Poole and Dottie Alexander.

By means of a Facebook post and an interview with Barnes, conducted by &quot;Stereogum&quot;, of Montreal&#x27;s album &quot;Aureate Gloom&quot; was announced. The record was influenced by &quot;the mid-to-late 1970s music scene in New York,&quot; including bands such as Talking Heads and Led Zeppelin. The album captures Barnes&#x27; emotions borne from their separation from their wife of 11 years and its aftermath. They described the album as being &quot;all over the place musically&quot;, lending to its reflection of their mindset during the time of its creation. The album was released March 3, 2015.

In August 2016, of Montreal released &quot;Innocence Reaches&quot;, which incorporated new, EDM-inspired sounds, as well as the progressive rock sounds of the previous two albums. For the tour following the album&#x27;s release, bassist Davey Pierce returned to the band, replacing Bob Parins.

On January 13, 2017, of Montreal released a new EP by surprise, entitled &quot;Rune Husk&quot;. On March 9, 2018, the album &quot;White Is Relic/Irrealis Mood&quot; was released on Polyvinyl, with singer Barnes explaining that the sound was influenced by &quot;extended dance mixes&quot; from the 1980s.

The band released its sixteenth studio album, &quot;Ur Fun&quot;, on January 17, 2020.
This was followed by the album, &quot;I Feel Safe with You, Trash&quot;, on March 5, 2021, and &quot;Freewave Lucifer F&lt;ck F^ck F&gt;ck&quot; on July 29, 2022. The band&#x27;s most recent album, Lady on the Cusp was released on May 17th, 2024.

<doc id="640625" wikidata="Q1041970" url="?curid=640625" title="Tokimeki Memorial">
<text>is a dating simulation series by Konami. It consists of eight main games in addition to many spin-offs. The games are notable in the dating sim genre for being highly nonlinear. Their nickname amongst their fans is the contraction &quot;TokiMemo&quot;.

The gameplay in &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot; focuses on scheduling, dating, and stat-building. The player has limited time to allocate between asking out members of the opposite sex and developing the playable character&#x27;s abilities at school and sport (with the long-term goal of becoming more seductive, not out of any intrinsic value). Dates are frequent but very brief, with usually only one multiple-choice question to determine whether the partner&#x27;s love meter will increase or decrease. One playthrough lasts for a fixed period of three years of high school (on the order of 5â10 hours of play), at the end of which the character with the highest love meter confesses their love.

==Spin-offs and merchandise==
&quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot; spin-offs and merchandise include:
* Numerous related video games:
** Two puzzle games based on the first game: &quot;Tokimeki Memorial Taisen Puzzle-dama&quot; (released in arcades, for Windows 95, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn) and &quot;Tokimeki Memorial Taisen Tokkae Dama&quot; (released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The former was released on the PlayStation Store in January 2010.
** One puzzle game based on the second game: &quot;Tokimeki Memorial 2 Puzzle Dama&quot; (released for the PlayStation).
** The &quot;Tokimeki Memorial 2 Substories&quot; series, consisting of three games (each game focuses on three of the girls from &quot;Tokimemo 2&quot; with the exception of the last game which focuses on four girls). The games are highly regarded for the mini-games in each game. The first game in the series, &quot;Dancing Summer Vacation&quot; focuses on Miyuki Kotobuki, Kaori Yae and the series&#x27; first (and so far, only) set of twins, Miho &amp; Maho Shirayuki. The mini-game for this game revolves around one of Konami&#x27;s other famous game series, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; using remixed &quot;Tokimeki Memorial 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; songs. The second game (&quot;Leaping School Festival&quot;) focuses on Ichimonji Akane, Akai Homura and Ijuuin Mei. Unlike the other two Substories games there are three mini games in this game (one for each girl). The final game in the series, &quot;Memories Ringing On&quot; focuses on Hikari Hinomoto, Kasumi Asou, Kotoko Minazuki and Kaedeko Sakura. There are two mini-games in this game (Bowling and Billiards). Most girls appear in each game and can also be won but the characters that are not at the center of the game do not get as much story as the main heroines of the corresponding game.
** &quot;Tokimeki Memorial 2 Music Video Clips: Circus de Aimashou&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Meet At The Circus&quot;) was released on the PlayStation 2. The game concentrates on 5 girls from the &quot;Tokimeki Memorial 2&quot; game (the girls being Sumire Nozaki, Hikari Hinomoto, Kasumi Asou, Kaori Yae, Homura Akai and Mei Ijuuin). Essentially being a collection of mini-games revolving around Sumire, players are able to choose one of the aforementioned girls before competing in the mini-games and if they play through and win the mini-games they are treated to an animated music video set to one of the chosen girl&#x27;s image songs.
** &quot;Tokimeki Memorial Private Collection&quot; (for the PlayStation), features a mini-game where the player pick one of the girls from &quot;Tokimemo 1&quot; as a partner and she asks questions based on &quot;TokiMemo 1&quot; (the questions would revolve around the girlâi.e.: her birthday, phone number, favorite items etc.). If the users correctly answer ten questions they are able to go to the beach with her and see her in her outfit.
** &quot;Tokimeki no Houkago&quot;, a quiz game for the PlayStation where the players pick one of the other female characters from &quot;Tokimemo 1&quot; as own partner and try to win her. Unlike the &quot;Private Collection&quot; game this game contains questions on general real life topics (and not the actual &quot;Tokimeki&quot; series) of the time (sport, manga, books etc.). This is the only time in the game&#x27;s series (for &quot;Tokimeki Memorial 1â3&quot;) where the players can also win with a male character. They can pick Yoshio Saotome (the info otaku where they get all the information on the girls) as own partner. There is an ending with him where is possible both make a promise to each other to find a girlfriend. Essentially this is like the &quot;Bad Ending&quot; from &quot;Tokimemo 1&quot; only with pictures added. Also this game expands on the endings from &quot;Tokimemo 1&quot; somewhat in that the players get to see pictures of them (with some slight animation) corresponding to their endings. For example, Ayako Katagiri wants to go to Paris to go to an art school. Her ending involves the players seeing her off at the airport (accompanied by a picture).
** &quot;Tokimeki Memorial SelectionâFujisaki Shiori&quot; is a game devoted to Shiori Fujisaki, the main heroine from &quot;Tokimemo 1&quot;. There is not much gameplay involved, as the game consists of an image gallery, two animated music videos and a mini game where the players can play Rock, Paper, Scissors with Shiori.
** A series of three romantic drama/adventure games, or visual novels, were also released for the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn, each one focusing on a specific girl from &quot;TokiMemo 1&quot;. The first was &quot;Nijiiro no Seishun&quot; (&quot;Rainbow-colored Youth&quot;), featuring Saki Nijino, who cheers the player on as the latter spends the game trying to make it on the school soccer team&#x27;s main line up. The second game, &quot;Irodori no Love Song&quot; (&quot;The Many Hues of a Love Song&quot;), focused on Katagiri Ayako with the player trying to compose a new song in time to win the school festival&#x27;s band contest. The third and final drama game was &quot;Tabidachi no Uta&quot; (&quot;Poem of Journeys&quot;) and featured both Shiori Fujisaki and Miharu Tatebayashi sharing a similar story about the player running a marathon just before graduation that branches off into different directions depending on which girl the players choose to pursue. The &quot;Drama&quot; series was developed by Hideo Kojima (of &quot;Metal Gear&quot; fame).
** A music game &quot;Tokimeki Idol&quot; was released for iOS and Android in early 2018.
* Several Konami crossover games have included characters from the series:
** The 2006 mobile phone game &quot;Konami Wai Wai Sokoban&quot; features Shiori Fujisaki as a playable character.
** &quot;Bombergirl&quot; and &quot;Mahjong Fight Girl&quot; features Shiori Fujisaki as a playable character.
** &quot;Super Bomberman R&quot; includes Shiori Fujisaki Bomber and Ayako Katagiri Bomber as playable characters.
* In episode #13 of &quot;GameCenter CX&quot; (known as &quot;Retro Game Master&quot; outside Japan), Shinya Arino, the host of the show, played through the PlayStation version of the game and successfully cleared it.

<text>Satanic Panic in the Attic is the sixth album released by the band Of Montreal. The album, like later albums &quot;The Sunlandic Twins&quot; and &quot;Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?&quot;, was made almost entirely by Kevin Barnes, and was the first to explore the dance and funk rhythms that would define their subsequent work.

The cover artwork is done by the singer/songwriter&#x27;s brother, David Barnes, with insert art by then-wife Nina Barnes. The cover art is a psychedelic parody of El Greco&#x27;s &quot;The Burial of the Count of Orgaz&quot;.

A 10th anniversary edition of the album was released exclusively on vinyl for Record Store Day 2014. The release contains the original album on 180g yellow vinyl as well as a 180g light blue vinyl disc with bonus tracks recorded around the same time as the album.

==Critical reception==

In August 2009, the webzine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;Disconnect the Dots&quot; the 260th track in their staff list &quot;The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s&quot;.

<text>Pall-mall, paille-maille, palle-maille, pell-mell, or palle-malle (, , ) is a lawn game (though primarily played on earth surfaces rather than grass) that was mostly played in the 16th and 17th centuries. It is considered a precursor to croquet.

==History==

Related to Italian (also known as lawn billiards or trucks in English) and similar games, pall-mall is an early modern development from , a French form of ground billiards.

The name comes from the Italian , which literally means &#x27;ball mallet&#x27;, ultimately derived from Latin , meaning &#x27;ball&#x27;, and meaning &#x27;maul, hammer, or mallet&#x27;. An alternative etymology has been suggested, from Middle French or &#x27;straw-mallet&#x27;, in reference to target hoops being made of bound straw.

===History in Britain===
It appears that pall mall was introduced from France into Scotland and later to England. The 19th-century historian Henry B. Wheatley states that &quot;pall mall was a popular game in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and few large towns were without a mall, or prepared ground, where it could be played; but it has now been so long out of use that no satisfactory account of the game can be found.&quot;

Mary, Queen of Scots, reportedly played pall mall at Seton Palace in East Lothian shortly after the murder of David Rizzio in the spring of 1566. King James VI in his 1599 &quot;Basilikon Doron&quot; mentions &quot;palle maillÃ©&quot; among the &quot;faire and pleasant field-games&quot; suitable for his son Prince Henry.

The author Henry B. Wheatley speculated that the game was introduced to England from Scotland after the accession of James VI in 1603, quoting a statement from Robert Dallington&#x27;s &quot;Method for Travell&quot;, that the game had not yet reached England. In the &quot;Method for Travell&quot;, which Wheatley dated to 1598 but may have been as late as 1605, Dallington marvels that pall-mall was one of the few French pastimes that had not been introduced to England.

The French ambassador Antoine LefÃ¨vre de la Boderie said that Prince Henry (in England) in 1606 played golf, which he compared to &quot;pallemail&quot;. One of Prince Henry&#x27;s biographers, in a work published in 1634, mentioned that he played &quot;gauffe (a play not unlike to Palemaille)&quot;. Prince Henry had a court or pitch, a &quot;pell mell&quot;, laid out at St James&#x27; Fields, north of St James&#x27;s Palace. It was surfaced with cockle shells crushed into clay or loam.

It is known that sometime around 1630 a Frenchman named John Bonnealle laid out a court for playing pall-mall on the south side of St. James&#x27;s Square, London, in an area known as St. James&#x27;s Field (later Pall Mall Field). &quot;A year or two&quot; later, in about 1631, Bonnealle had died and the king&#x27;s shoemaker, David Mallard or Mallock, had built a house on this land, which he was ordered to demolish by Candlemas Day (around 2 February) 1632.

Evidently, the pall-mall court was rebuilt at this site, as Archibald Lumsden received a grant on 30 September 1635 &quot;for sole furnishing of all the &#x27;Malls,&#x27; bowls, scoops, and other necessaries for the game of Pall Mall within his grounds in St. James&#x27;s Fields, and that such as resort there shall pay him such sums of money as are according to the ancient order of the game.&quot;

Lumsden&#x27;s pall-mall court also appears in the records in September 1660, when his daughter Isabella petitioned for &quot;one of the tenements in St. James&#x27;s Field, as promised to her father who spent Â£425 14s in keeping the sport of Pall Mall&quot;. Accounts attached to the petition appeared to indicate the money was spent on &quot;bowls, malls and scopes, 1632 to 1635, and in repairs in Pall Mall, when the Queen went thither to lie in of the Lady Mary.&quot;

Samuel Pepys&#x27;s diary for 2 April 1661 records that he went &quot;into St. James&#x27;s Park, where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele, the first time that I ever saw the sport&quot;.

There do not appear to be references earlier than 1630 to the game being played in England. The game is mentioned in a 1611 FrenchâEnglish dictionary, but this does not demonstrate that it was actually played in England at that time:

Cotgrave&#x27;s description of the long alley-like playing surface with an iron hoop at either end accords well with reports of the game as played in London twenty years later. However, there&#x27;s little reason to read this as an implication that the game was played in England in 1611, especially given that he is providing an English definition of a French word.

An early 19th-century writer on English games, Joseph Strutt, quotes Cotgrave&#x27;s description and the association with Restoration royalty:
The game was still known in the early nineteenth century, as is proved by its reference in many English dictionaries. In Samuel Johnson&#x27;s 1828 dictionary, his definition of &quot;Pall mall&quot; clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet: &quot;A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring&quot;. In his unpublished memoir the writer Oswell Blakeston reports seeing it played at &quot;the only pub that still has a green for this game&quot; in the late 1930s.

==Game play==
It was played in a long alley with an iron hoop suspended over the ground at the end. The object was to strike a boxwood ball of unknown circumference (a modern croquet ball is normally in diameter, which equates to approx , in circumference) with a heavy wooden mallet, down the alley and through the hoop with the fewest hits possible. Many references tell us that the ball was about in diameter. However, it is known that this is not correct, as a ball of that size would be far, far too heavy to lift to a high height with a small mallet. Note the ball in the engraving. It is thought that the ball was likely in the region of or slightly larger. It differed from trucco especially in its more extreme length of playing area, suggesting a closer relationship to golf than other derivatives of ground billiards.

Pall-mall was popular in Italy, France and Scotland, and spread to England and other parts of Western Europe in the 16th century. The name refers not only to the game, but also to the mallet used and the alley in which it was played. Many cities still have long straight roads or promenades which evolved from the alleys in which the game was played. Such in London are Pall Mall and the Mall, in Hamburg the Palmaille, in Paris the Rue du Mail, the Avenue du Mail in Geneva, and in Utrecht the Maliebaan. When the game fell out of fashion, some of these &quot;pall malls&quot; evolved into shopping areas, hence the modern name of shopping centres in North Americaâshopping mallsâwhile others evolved into grassed, shady promenades, still called malls today.

== In popular culture ==

* Pall-mall features heavily in Julia Quinn&#x27;s Regency romance novel &quot;The Viscount Who Loved Me&quot; and its subsequent second epilogue.
* The second season of the Netflix series &quot;Bridgerton&quot;, based on Quinn&#x27;s novel, prominently features a game of pall-mall as an annual tradition for the siblings of the eponymous family. Because of the series&#x27; popularity, department store John Lewis reported a 90% spike in the sales of croquet sets, the modern equivalent of pall-mall.

The theme of the convention was &quot;Fulfilling America&#x27;s Promise by Building a Safer World and a More Hopeful America.&quot; Defining moments of the 2004 Republican National Convention include a featured keynote address by Zell Miller and the confirmation of the nomination of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for reelection. Bush and Cheney went on to defeat the Democratic Party&#x27;s ticket of John Kerry and John Edwards in the 2004 presidential election.

==Platform==
Apart from nominating a candidate for president and vice president, the 2004 Republican National Convention was also charged with crafting an official party platform and political agenda for the next four years. At the helm of the Platform Committee was United States Senator and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee, Congresswoman Melissa Hart of Pennsylvania and Colorado Governor Bill Owens. The committee worked with the Bush campaign to develop the draft platform.

The platform adopted by the 2004 Republican National Convention was the longest in the party&#x27;s history compared to the mere 1,000-word platform adopted at the first convention in 1856. At 48,000 words, it was twice the length of the one adopted at the 2004 Democratic National Convention which was only 19,500 words.

==Venue==

The choice of Madison Square Garden on January 31, 2003, by all 165 members of the Republican National Committee as the venue for the 2004 Republican National Convention meant that New York City would host a major Republican nominating convention for the first time in its history. On July 19, control of Madison Square Garden was officially handed over to the Republican Party under the administration of Chief Executive Officer of the Convention, Bill Harris. Mayor Michael Bloomberg thanked the party for their choice, for which he had vigorously lobbied, noting it as a significant display of support for the city and an economic boom.

Until Chicago, Illinois was selected as the host of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, 2004 was the last time that for either major party that they chose to hold their convention in a state that was not considered to be a swing state (the Democrats held their 2004 convention in Boston, Massachusetts).

===Security===
Like the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officially declared the 2004 Republican National Convention a National Special Security Event (NSSE). As such, the United States Secret Service was charged with employing and coordinating all federal and local agencies including the various bureaus of DHS, the FBI, and the NYPD to secure the venue from terrorist attacks. Expected security expenditures reached $70Â million, $50Â million of which was funded by the federal government.

The city employed an active beat of 10,000 police officers deployed as &quot;Hercules teams&quot;âuniformed in full riot gear and body armor, and equipped with submachine guns and rifles. Commuter and Amtrak trains entering and exiting Penn Station were scoured by bomb-sniffing dogs as uniformed police officers were attached to buses carrying delegates. All employees of buildings surrounding Madison Square Garden were subjected to thorough screening and background checks.

The NYPD infiltrated and compiled dossiers on protest groups (most of whom were doing nothing illegal), leading to over 1,800 arrests and subsequent fingerprinting.

===Timing===
The convention took place in New York City a week before the third anniversary of September 11. The attacks were a primary theme of the convention, from the choice of speakers to repeated invocations of the attacks.
At the convention, there was a performance of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; by Daniel Rodriguez, a tribute to those killed on September 11. Relatives of three of the victims spoke and talked about how September 11 brought the country together. Also contributing musically were Brooks &amp; Dunn, Sara Evans, Lee Ann Womack, Darryl Worley.

==Speakers==
Early in the summer leading up to the 2004 Republican National Convention, Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie announced the first slate of convention speakers. He added, &quot;It is an honor to announce the addition of these outstanding Americans to the 2004 Republican National Convention program. For the past three and a half years, President Bush has led with strength and compassion and these speakers reflect that.&quot; Chief Executive Officer of the Convention Bill Harris commented, &quot;These speakers have seen President Bush&#x27;s strong, steady leadership and each will attest to his character from a unique perspective. Their vast experience and various points of view are a testament to the depth and breadth of the support for the Republican ticket in 2004.&quot;

===Zell Miller===
Considered to be one of the most interesting choices for speakers at the convention was a keynote address by Georgia Senator Zell Miller, a conservative Democrat. Miller had consistently voted with Republicans. In an editorial in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Miller cited that the reason for his defection was that, &quot;I barely recognize my party anymore.&quot; He continued, &quot;Today, it&#x27;s the Democratic Party that has mastered the art of division and diversion. To run for president as a Democrat these days you have to go from interest group to interest group, cap in hand, asking for the support of liberal kingmakers.&quot; He finished by saying, &quot;I still believe in hope and opportunity and, when it comes right down to it, Mr. Bush is the man who represents hope and opportunity.&quot;

His keynote address was a visceral smite to Democrats and an excoriating attack on John Kerry, blaming him for the divisions in America. Notably, he mocked Kerry&#x27;s call for strength in the armed forces by noting several important military projects that Kerry had opposed, saying that Kerry wanted &quot;forces armed with what - spitballs?&quot; Including Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, he claimed &quot;no pair has been more wrong, more loudly, more often, than the two senators from Massachusetts: Ted Kennedy and John Kerry.&quot;

In his speech, Miller also heaped his praise for 1940 Republican presidential nominee Wendell Willkie for supporting President Roosevelt&#x27;s establishment of a military draft, raising concerns about the intentions of President Bush in this area.

Zell Miller also delivered the keynote address on behalf of Bill Clinton in 1992 at Madison Square Garden. He remained a Democrat in the Senate until leaving in 2005 (he was not running for reelection). However, after this address, his affiliation with the national Democratic Party was unquestionably over.

===Nancy Reagan&#x27;s absence===
Nancy Reagan&#x27;s spokesperson announced that the former First Lady fully supported President Bush for the general election. The spokesperson added that while the former First Lady and her children would be absent from the 2004 Republican National Convention, President Reagan&#x27;s son with Jane Wyman, Michael Reagan, had accepted an invitation to address the delegates. Nancy Reagan appeared in the filmed tribute he introduced. He dedicated the film to everyone who helped make his father president of the United States.

During the convention, delegates paid tribute to Reagan in different ways. Many of the speakers from California and Illinois, including House Speaker Dennis Hastert, mentioned Reagan in their speeches and compared Reagan to Bush. Those from Illinois, including Hastert, compared Bush to both Reagan and Abraham Lincoln, another native son of their state.

==Protests==
Protest activity included marches, rallies, performances, demonstrations, exhibits, and acts of civil disobedience in New York City to protest the 2004 Republican National Convention and the nomination of President George W. Bush for the 2004 U.S. presidential election, as well as a much smaller number of people who marched to support Bush at the convention.

On May 17, 2006 Amy Goodman, host of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; reported on the FBI launch of a criminal civil rights investigation of NYPD after Desert storm veteran Dennis Kyne went to trial and had all charges dropped due to video evidence showing the police falsified reports and sworn testimony.
