<text>Lorenzo Bruno Nero Dallaglio (born 10 August 1972), known as Lawrence Dallaglio, is an English retired rugby union player, former captain of England, and 2016 inductee of the World Rugby Hall of Fame.

Dallaglio played as a flanker or number eight for London Wasps and never played for another club, having arrived at Sudbury as a teenager. Playing in all three positions in the back row, he won 85 caps for England, and was part of the team that won the 2003 World Cup. He is one of a very small number of players to have won both the Rugby World Cup and Sevens World Cup. He went on three tours with the British &amp; Irish Lions, winning three caps.

Dallaglio now regularly works as a pundit on television rugby coverage and on radio.

==Early life==
Dallaglio was born in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London. He was educated at King&#x27;s House School in Richmond and boarded at Ampleforth College where he was affectionately known as &quot;Del Boy&quot;, (though he actually attained his A-levels at The Oxford School of Learning), and at Kingston University to study Property Development. His sister Francesca, a 19-year-old student ballerina, died in the Marchioness disaster in 1989.

In 1985, as a 12-year-old chorister in the King&#x27;s House School choir, Dallaglio and 20 other choristers sang backing vocals on the song &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need Another Hero&quot; by Tina Turner. This only became known in 2005, when the Musicians&#x27; Union, having realised that the choristers had not been paid royalties on the record, attempted to track them down. As part of the same choir, Dallaglio sang at the wedding of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Because Dallaglio&#x27;s father, Vincenzo, is Italian, and his English-born mother, Eileen, was of Irish descent he was eligible to play for both Italy and Ireland, as well as England, and in the early 1990s he turned down an invitation to play for Ireland.

==Club career==

In 1998 Dallaglio became club captain when Dean Ryan and Rob Andrew left for Newcastle in October 1995, taking four experienced players with them. Dallaglio held the team together and 12 months later led Wasps to the first English league title of the professional era.

Dallaglio had a good season in 1999–2000, when he regained the club captaincy. Although Wasps&#x27; league form was disappointing, he led them to the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup and to a second successive Tetley&#x27;s Bitter Cup victory.

Dallaglio returned from an ankle injury early in the 2006–07 domestic season to reclaim the club captaincy at Wasps, but an indifferent Guinness Premiership season ended with them failing to qualify for the play-offs for the first time since the introduction of the knockout system. However, Dallaglio and his teammates saved their best performances for the Heineken Cup; he led the club to its second European championship win on 20 May 2007. The final, played at Twickenham, set a world record for the highest attendance figure for a club rugby match (at around 82,000). Wasps&#x27; opponents, Leicester Tigers had already won the EDF Energy Cup and the Guinness Premiership trophies and were favourites to achieve an unprecedented Treble, especially as they had beaten Wasps 40–26 at Welford Road less than a month earlier, but it was Wasps who emerged as victors, winning the game 25–9.

In the following season he joined London Wasps late because of the Rugby World Cup. He returned to find London Wasps struggling near the bottom of the Guinness Premiership. Wasps fortunes quickly changed. They made it through the group in the EDF Cup, and started climbing up the table. Despite this good form in domestic competitions, they narrowly failed to make it out of their Heineken Cup group. They lost out to Munster, the eventual winners, but could have made it out if they had beaten them in Ireland in the final matchday of pool play.

They soon hit top form in the Premiership, winning game after game. They reached the play-offs and drew a home match against Bath. They won the game 21-6, but lost rising star Danny Cipriani to an injury. Leicester Tigers beat Gloucester to qualify for the Premiership final. This match was to be Lawrence Dallaglio&#x27;s last match, and it was to be played in front of a capacity crowd of 81,600 at Twickenham. They were made to fight, but eventually won 26-16. Dallaglio later claimed it was Wasps&#x27; greatest Premiership title, noting the damaging effect the Rugby World Cup had on their squad.

In the 67th minute of the Premiership final, Dallaglio was substituted, and received a standing ovation by the sell out crowd.

Dallaglio made a sly appearance, at blindside flanker, for London Wasps &quot;A&quot; Team in the Guinness A League on 8 September 2008. He was getting game time before he captained an England XV for the Help For Heroes game at Twickenham on 20 September later that month.

==International==
Dallaglio was a member of the inaugural World Cup Sevens-winning squad with England in 1993.

He was then a surprise choice for the 1994 England tour to South Africa. Yet the following winter he was not guaranteed a place in Wasps&#x27; back-row. He made his debut for England in November 1995 as a substitute against the Springboks and toured South Africa as a member of the 1997 British &amp; Irish Lions squad. He was given the England captaincy in the autumn of 1997 by new coach Clive Woodward, taking over from Phil de Glanville. The other candidate for the job, Martin Johnson, had led the Lions tour, but Dallaglio was preferred.

===2003 Rugby World Cup===
After another strong season in 2000–01, he was selected for his second Lions tour, but an injury in the last game of the domestic season, against Bath, meant he was doubtful for the trip to Australia. The Lions passed him fit but the knee gave way in a mid-week match, cutting short his tour and forcing him to undergo reconstructive surgery.

Dallaglio was a key member of England&#x27;s 2003 Grand Slam and World Cup-winning side, being the only player to play in every minute of England&#x27;s World Cup campaign. With the World Cup win, he became one of the two players – the other being England scrum half Matt Dawson – to have won the World Cup in both the 15- and 7-a-side competitions.

Dallaglio was re-appointed as captain after Martin Johnson retired. In August 2004, Dallaglio announced his retirement from the national team due to &quot;the brutal demands of international rugby&quot; but after being selected for the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand he changed his mind and made himself available for international selection again.

He regained the captaincy in 2004 after Johnson&#x27;s retirement from international rugby, but without Johnson the team played poorly, and Dallaglio announced his retirement from international rugby on 31 August 2004.

Despite his international retirement, Dallaglio was called up for his third Lions tour in 2005 but he fractured his ankle during the first tour match, against Bay of Plenty on 4 June, and did not play again during the tour.

===2007 Rugby World Cup===
At the end of 2005, Dallaglio announced that he was making himself available again for England selection and he was included in the squad for the 2006 Six Nations Championship. He was named on the bench for England&#x27;s opening match of the tournament against Wales on 4 February at Twickenham. He was a blood replacement for clubmate Joe Worsley after 13 minutes and on 64 minutes was a replacement for Martin Corry, touching down with a clinically executed charge from the back of the scrum on 70 minutes. He gained three more caps off the bench during the tournament, but did not play in the last game of the championship, when England lost 28–24 to Ireland.

Dallaglio continued to play for England, especially in the number eight position, forming – with Neil Back and Richard Hill – the Hill, Back, Dallaglio back-row trio affectionately nicknamed the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot;.
On 15 June 2007, Dallaglio was one of 47 players chosen by England coach Brian Ashton to attend a pre-World Cup training camp and he was later named in the 30-man World Cup squad, alongside Joe Worsley and Jason Robinson, who were also veterans of England&#x27;s 2003 Rugby World Cup success. Dallaglio said &quot;The fans can expect this England team to give absolutely everything and play with an enormous amount of passion and pride.&quot;

England started poorly in the tournament, with an unconvincing 28–10 victory over the United States and a 36–0 loss to eventual champions South Africa. Dallaglio started the first game at number eight, but was dropped for the South Africa match in favour of Nick Easter, who became first choice for the rest of the tournament. Following the loss to South Africa, England began to improve steadily and, against most expectations, reached the final, where they lost a closely fought game. The improvement in performance was credited to the influence of a number of senior players, including Dallaglio (who made a number of appearances off the bench) and Mike Catt.

Soon after the World Cup tournament, Dallaglio and Catt each published an autobiography that was serialised in a major newspaper. Both players were highly critical of coach Brian Ashton&#x27;s performance. Many commentators questioned the wisdom of making public criticisms so soon after the tournament and Dallaglio later issued a clarification and partial apology.

==Captaincy==
Warren Gatland has said that Dallaglio was &quot;The best captain that I’ve ever been involved with.&quot;

==Retirement==
On 3 January 2008, Dallaglio announced that he was retiring from international rugby with immediate effect and from domestic rugby at the end of the current season; he also stated that he would like to take up coaching in the future. At the end to his career, Wasps won the 2008 Premiership Final on 31 May 2008 in front of a capacity crowd of 81,600 at Twickenham, then a world rugby union record attendance for a club match.

==Drugs scandal==
On 24 May 1999 Dallaglio resigned as England&#x27;s rugby union captain following allegations in the &quot;News of the World&quot; that he had used and been a dealer in hard drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy. The newspaper also reported that Dallaglio had boasted about taking drugs at a party during the Lions tour to South Africa, in 1997.

Dallaglio &quot;categorically denied&quot; the newspaper&#x27;s claim that he had dealt in drugs and said he had been the victim of &quot;an elaborate set-up&quot;. In response, &quot;News of the World&quot; editor Phil Hall said: &quot;We stand by our story. Lawrence Dallaglio is damned in his own words and, frankly, we are amazed at his denial.&quot;

England coach Clive Woodward, who was one of a panel of senior Rugby Football Union (RFU) officials who met Dallaglio to investigate the matter, said he was &quot;bitterly disappointed&quot; for the player and his family but was confident he would be &quot;proved innocent&quot;. The RFU undertook their own investigation to assess the veracity of the claims and Leicester lock and British &amp; Irish Lions skipper Martin Johnson was appointed to replace Dallaglio as England captain. Dallaglio was later fined £15,000 plus costs by the RFU for the incident.

==Post-retirement==
Dallaglio was an analyst for ITV&#x27;s coverage of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. He co-commentated with Nick Mullins in the semi-final between Australia and New Zealand. He followed this up with a similar role in 2015.

==Charitable work==
Dallaglio captained the Help for Heroes XV at a charity match in Twickenham. The side, which included former England Internationals Will Greenwood, Jason Robinson and former England Team Manager Martin Johnson, defeated the International XV led by former Wales captain Scott Gibbs. Dallaglio ended the match by kicking the final conversion, bringing the score to 29–10. In front of a 52,254-strong crowd at Twickenham the game raised approximately £1.3 million for Help for Heroes.

Following the success of his testimonial year, Dallaglio set himself the challenge of raising half a million pounds for charity, and with help and support from colleagues, friends and family the total ended up being over a million pounds, which was contributed to various charitable causes.

In summer 2008, he cycled 933 km across the Pyrenees as part of a team of 30 cyclists, raising £435,000 for Bliss, the special care baby charity. Starting out in Biarritz and finishing in Banyuls, he was joined by former rugby union footballer Damian Hopley and ski expert Warren Smith.

After his mother Eileen died of cancer in 2008, Lawrence set up Dallaglio RugbyWorks in 2009.

Rugbyworks&#x27; inaugural event 8 Rocks 2009 raised over £600,000. The charity expanded significantly and made close to £10 million in total by 2013. In 2011 Dallaglio wanted to redefine the focus of the charity, and created a social inclusion programme. Dallaglio RugbyWorks is an intensive, long-term skills development programme based on rugby, through which the aim is to get teenagers who have been excluded from mainstream education into sustained education, employment or training.

In February 2010, Dallaglio embarked on a bicycle ride from Rome to Edinburgh during the RBS 6 Nations Championship to raise money for Sport Relief and Dallaglio RugbyWorks. The &quot;Dallaglio Cycle Slam&quot; took place over the course of a month, seeing a team, including former Arsenal FC and England football international Lee Dixon cycling through all of the RBS 6 Nations countries, taking in each of the international rugby stadia along the way. The aim was to raise £1 million, net proceeds of which were split equally between Sport Relief and the newly formed Dallaglio RugbyWorks, whose beneficiaries include Cancer Research UK, DebRA, Leukaemia Research, Help for Heroes and the RPA Benevolent Fund.

In 2012, Dallaglio joined forces with former England cricketer Andrew Flintoff for the Dallaglio Flintoff Cycle Slam 2012. They were joined by former footballers Lee Dixon and Graeme Le Saux, and a number of other celebrities and members of the public in a bid to cycle from Olympia in Greece, covering 521 km to the Olympic stadium in Stratford, London. The Dallaglio Flintoff Cycle Slam 2012 raised over two million pounds for Cancer Research UK and Great Ormond Street Hospital via Dallaglio RugbyWorks and the AF Foundation with a portion of the money raised going to Virgin Unite, Virgin’s non-profit arm.

In 2014, Dallaglio led the third Dallaglio Cycle Slam from Treviso in Italy cycling over 2,300 km to Twickenham Stadium. The challenge raised over £650,000 for Dallaglio RugbyWorks and Teenage Cancer Trust.

In 2016, Dallaglio was joined by 160 riders from San Sebastien to Andorra, Barcelona, Majorca and Ibiza, over 2,000 km. The event raised over £1 million for Dallaglio RugbyWorks.

In 2018, 300 cyclists including rugby player Austin Healey, Andrew Ridgeley from Wham! and actor John Hannah also participated in the Dallaglio Cycle Slam.

==Personal life==
Dallaglio married his long-time girlfriend, Alice, in 2005. They have two daughters, Ella and Josie, and a son, Enzo. Alice is the daughter of Lydia Corbett, formerly known as Sylvette David, a famous model of Pablo Picasso.

Already a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

He has also received an Honorary Doctorate from Buckinghamshire New University for services to sport. The Doctorate was conferred on 12 September 2008.

<text>Delvaux is a Belgian manufacturer of fine leather luxury goods founded in 1829 by Charles Delvaux. The company is the oldest fine leather luxury goods house in the world. Since 2021 the company has been owned by Richemont.

==History==

In 1829, a year before Belgium declared its independence, Charles Delvaux opened a travel goods workshop and store in Brussels, Belgium. 

In 1883, Delvaux was granted the title of &quot;Official purveyor to the Royal Court of Belgium” as it started supplying leather goods to Belgium’s royalty. 

In 1908, Delvaux filed its first patents for handbags.

Delvaux is a warrant holder to the Court of Belgium.

The house went into a gradual decline at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1933 an agricultural engineer with no experience in leather goods, Franz Schwennicke, took over the company from Edmond Delvaux, the last of the Delvaux family line. While keeping the manufacturing of travel goods, he progressively introduced a new concept for the time, the creation of seasonal collections, as is still done to this day.

For the 1958 Brussels World Fair, Delvaux introduced the &quot;Le Brillant&quot; handbag, designed by Paule Goethals. The range-topping &quot;Le Brillant&quot;, still produced today, marked the first time the brand would create a product displaying the brand logo, in this case a buckle in the shape of a &quot;D&quot; letter.

When Franz Schwennicke died in 1970, his wife Solange succeeded him, focusing on strengthening the creativity and expanding internationally. A light holdall model, the &quot;Le Pin&quot; was introduced to meet the needs of the new generation of career women who were looking for larger handbags to carry their accessories and personal effects.

In 1988, a second workshop opened to meet rising demand, this time in Bourg-Argental, France.

At the end of the 80s, François Schwennicke, the eldest son of Franz and Solange, became Executive Chairman.

In 1994, the headquarters were moved back to Brussels, this time to the former arsenal of the Belgian Army on Boulevard Louis Schmidt. L&#x27;Arsenal was designed by Henri van Dievoet, a Belgian architect strongly inspired by Art Nouveau.

The 180th anniversary of Delvaux was celebrated in 2009 and that milestone became the title of a book by Judah Hettie and Véronique Pouillard and the title of an exhibition at the Fashion Museum of Antwerp.

In 2011, the investment arm of the Fung Group, First Heritage Brands, took a majority stake in the company with the ambition to further grow it internationally.

In 2021, the company was acquired by the Swiss Conglomerate, Compagnie Financiere Richemont S.A.

==Products==

Delvaux creates two collections per year, Spring-Summer and Autumn-Winter. Each collection sees the introduction of new materials and new colors.

The current major lines of women&#x27;s bags: &quot;Le Brillant&quot; (designed in 1958), &quot;Le Tempête&quot; (1967), &quot;Le Madame&quot; (1977) and &quot;Le Pin&quot; (1972). Other designs include &quot;Le Simplissime&quot; (1969), &quot;Le Givry&quot; (1977), and &quot;Le Louise&quot; (1973).

In 2014, a line of men&#x27;s bags was added.

In 2016, Delvaux launched &quot;Le Mutin&quot; (2016), inspired by &quot;Le Chasseresse&quot;, a Delvaux design of 1962.

In 2017, the Maison created the &quot;Miniatures Belgitude &quot; (2017), a collection of 7 miniature versions of &quot;Le Brillant&quot;, each representing a symbol of Belgium, celebrating the origins of the house.

In 2018, Delvaux introduced &quot;Le Cool Box&quot; (2018) and &quot;Le D to D&quot; (2018).

Delvaux also creates small leather goods, custom jewellery and scarves.

Since 1938, each new model is entered into a Gold Book alongside its detailed description and the name of its designer.

==Boutiques==

Delvaux operates about 10 stores in Belgium with its flagship boutique being &quot;Le 27&quot; at 27, Boulevard de Waterloo in Brussels, Belgium.

In 2014, Delvaux opened its first international flagship boutiques in Paris, Tokyo and London. 
In 2018 Delvaux opened a second boutique in London on Sloane Street, as well as its first boutique in Italy, in Milan.

In January 2019 Delvaux also opened its first American flagship in New York City, on the fabled Fifth Avenue at the corner of 59th Street, on Manhattan&#x27;s elegant Upper East Side, overlooking Central Park. The boutique is situated in the Sherry-Netherland building, at the former site of A La Vieille Russie.

Delvaux operates 42 stores in the world, including doors in Belgium, England, Italy, the United States, China and Japan.

It is otherwise distributed through specialty and department stores in Australia, Austria, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Lebanon, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom and the United States.

<text>Media Matters for America (MMfA) is a non-profit left-leaning watchdog journalism organization. It was founded in 2004 by journalist and political activist David Brock as a counterweight to the conservative Media Research Center. It seeks to spotlight &quot;conservative misinformation&quot; in the U.S. media; its methods include issuing reports and quick responses. Two example initiatives include the &quot;Drop Fox&quot; campaign (2011–2013) that sought to discredit Fox News&#x27; &quot;fair and balanced&quot; claims; and a 2023 report about X (formerly Twitter) that highlighted antisemitism on the platform.

==Organization overview==

=== Founding ===
Media Matters for America was founded in May 2004 by David Brock, a former conservative journalist. Brock said that a central goal would be to monitor journalists and outlets for misleading conservative claims and then to point them out. Brock argued that existing conservative monitoring groups had been doing this and pushing mainstream journalists, the media, and American politics, to the right as a result. Brock founded the group with help from the Center for American Progress.

===Funding===
In 2004, MMfA began with the help of $2 million in donations. That year MMfA received the endorsement of the Democracy Alliance, a partnership of wealthy and politically active progressive donors. The Alliance itself does not fund endorsees, but many wealthy Alliance members acted on the endorsement and donated directly to MMfA. In 2010, George Soros donated $1 million to MMfA citing concerns that the &quot;incendiary rhetoric of Fox News hosts may incite violence.&quot; During a 2014 CNN interview, David Brock stated that Soros&#x27; contributions were &quot;less than 10 percent&quot; of Media Matters&#x27; budget.

===Personnel===
John Podesta, the former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, provided office space for Media Matters early in its formation at the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank which Podesta established in 2002. Hillary Clinton advised Media Matters in its early stages out of a belief that progressives should follow conservatives in forming think tanks and advocacy groups to support their political goals. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Media Matters &quot;helped lay the groundwork&quot; for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign.

Media Matters has hired several of the best known political professionals who have worked for Democratic politicians and for other progressive groups. In 2004, &quot;National Review&quot; referred to MMfA staffers who had recently worked on the presidential campaigns of John Edwards and Wesley Clark, for Congressman Barney Frank, and for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Eric E. Burns served as MMfA&#x27;s president until 2011. Burns was succeeded by Matt Butler, and then, in 2013, by Bradley Beychok. In late 2016, Angelo Carusone replaced Bradley Beychok as MMfA&#x27;s president. Under Carusone, the organization&#x27;s focus has shifted toward focusing on the alt-right, conspiracy theories, and fake news.

In 2014, the staff of Media Matters voted to join the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Initially, Media Matters management had declined to recognize the union through a card check process, instead exercising its right to force a union election which delayed the process until July when the vote went in favor of unionization.

In May 2024, a dozen staffers at Media Matters were laid off amid a series of lawsuits and legal investigations by Elon Musk and Republican state attorneys general.

== Initiatives ==

===Early research===
Media Matters analyzes American news sources from networks and channels to websites, including NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, OAN, Breitbart and Fox News, as well as conservative talk radios. Its techniques include content analysis, fact checking, monitoring, and comparison of quotes or presentations from media figures to primary documents such as Pentagon or Government Accountability Office reports.

Beginning in 2006, Media Matters for America has released a number of studies which documented that Democrats and progressives were outnumbered by Republicans and conservatives in terms of guest appearances on television news programs.

On September 12, 2007, Media Matters released a comprehensive study of 1,377 U.S. newspapers and the 201 syndicated political columnists the papers carry on a regular basis. Media Matters said &quot;in paper after paper, state after state, and region after region, conservative syndicated columnists get more space than their progressive counterparts.&quot; John Diaz, an editor at the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, cautioned that the small town columnists leaned significantly to the right, which he felt could explain the rightward slant in columnists even if the trend doesn&#x27;t hold for papers with the largest readership.

=== &quot;Misinformer of the Year&quot; ===
An annual feature on the Media Matters website is the title of &quot;Misinformer of the Year&quot;, which is given to the journalist, commentator, or network that Media Matters contends was responsible for the most factual errors or claims. Past recipients include Rupert Murdoch, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Mark Zuckerberg, and Steve Bannon.

=== Progressive Talent Initiative ===
The initiative seeks to train mid-career liberal pundits in media skills like TV interviews using four-day bootcamps.

=== Media Matters Action Network ===
In 2010 David Brock established Media Matters Action Network, a 501(c)(4), to track conservative politicians and organizations.

In 2009, Media Matters Action Network launched the Conservative Transparency website, aimed at tracking the funding of conservative activist organizations. Media Matters Action Network established the Political Correction project with the goal of holding conservative politicians and advocacy groups accountable.

In December 2010, Media Matters Action Network started EqualityMatters.org, a site &quot;in support of gay equality&quot;. At launch the site fully incorporated Media Matters&#x27;s content on LGBT issues. Designed to provide talking points for liberal activists and politicians, Brock set up the Message Matters project. Media Matters runs the website DropFox.com and works to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. One target, Orbitz, initially referred to Media Matters&#x27; efforts as a &quot;smear campaign&quot;, but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week effort by prominent LGBT organizations, to &quot;review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed&quot;. In 2015, the formal Equality Matters program was deactivated and merged with the LGBT Program within Media Matters.

=== American Bridge 21st Century ===
Brock established American Bridge 21st Century as a super PAC focused on opposition research in 2010.

===Don Imus===
On April 4, 2007, Media Matters posted a video clip of Don Imus calling the Rutgers University women&#x27;s basketball team members &quot;nappy-headed hoes&quot; and made their discovery known in Media Matters&#x27; daily e-mailing to hundreds of journalists. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, top news outlets didn&#x27;t mention the incident until objections made to CBS Radio by the National Association of Black Journalists led to an on-the-air apology from Imus. MSNBC, calling Imus&#x27;s comments &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;abhorrent&quot;, suspended Imus&#x27; show, and within minutes, CBS suspended Imus&#x27;s radio show. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said Imus&#x27;s apology &quot;seemed to make matters worse, with critics latching on to Mr. Imus&#x27;s use of the phrase &#x27;you people.&#x27;&quot; Included among those dissatisfied with Imus&#x27;s apology and suspension were the coach of the Rutgers team and a group of MSNBC African-American employees. After Procter &amp; Gamble pulled advertising from all of MSNBC&#x27;s daytime schedule, and other advertisers, including General Motors and American Express requested CBS to cancel any upcoming advertising they had bought for &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot;, MSNBC and CBS dropped Imus&#x27;s show.

===Rush Limbaugh &quot;phony soldiers&quot;===

In September 2007, Media Matters reported on radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh saying Iraq War veterans opposed to the war were &quot;the phony soldiers&quot;. Limbaugh later said he was speaking of only one soldier, Jesse Macbeth, who had falsely claimed to have been decorated for valor but had never seen combat. Limbaugh said he was the victim of a &quot;smear&quot; by Media Matters, which had taken out of context and selectively edited his comments. After Limbaugh published what he said was the entire transcript of phony soldiers discussion, Media Matters reported that over a minute and 30 seconds was omitted without &quot;notation or ellipsis to indicate that there is, in fact, a break in the transcript.&quot; Limbaugh told &quot;National Review&quot; that the gap between referring to &quot;phony soldiers&quot; and MacBeth was a delay because his staff printed out an ABC news story that reported on what it called &quot;phony soldiers&quot; and that his transcript and audio edits were &quot;for space and relevance reasons, not to hide anything.&quot;

The Associated Press, CNN, and ABC reported on the controversy, as political satirist and fictional pundit Stephen Colbert lampooned Limbaugh and his defenders saying: &quot;Hey, Media Matters, you want to end offensive speech? Then stop recording it for people who would be offended.&quot;

===Bill O&#x27;Reilly Harlem restaurant===
In October 2007 television and radio host and commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly said a Media Matters headline declaring &quot;O&#x27;Reilly surprised &#x27;there was no difference&#x27; between Harlem restaurant and other New York restaurants&quot; took out of context comments he made regarding a pleasant dinner he shared with Al Sharpton at a Harlem restaurant. O&#x27;Reilly said Media Matters misleadingly took comments spoken five minutes apart and presented them as one. On NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, Media Matters senior fellow Paul Waldman said Media Matters had included &quot;the full audio, the full transcript, nothing was taken out of context&quot;.

===Laura Schlessinger racial slur===
On August 12, 2010, Media Matters reported that radio host Laura Schlessinger said the word &quot;nigger&quot; eleven times during a discussion with an African-American woman, although Schlessinger did not use the word as a slur. Schlessinger continued to say the word after the caller took offense, saying she thought the woman was being too sensitive and that a double standard was being used to determine who could say the word. Schlessinger also said that those &quot;hypersensitive&quot; about color should not &quot;marry outside of their race&quot;. The caller had earlier in the discussion said her husband was white. Schlessinger apologized for the epithet the day after the broadcast. A joint statement of Media Matters and other organizations noted that although Schlessinger &quot;attempted to apologize for using the epithet, the racist diatribe on Tuesday&#x27;s show extends far beyond the use of a single word&quot; and urged advertisers to boycott her show. After General Motors, OnStar, and Motel 6 pulled their advertising, Schlessinger said she would not renew her syndication contract set to expire December 2010. In January 2011, her show resumed on satellite radio.

Schlessinger held Media Matters responsible for the boycott, which she called a typical tactic of the group to fulfill its &quot;sole purpose of silencing people&quot;. She said the boycotts&#x27; &quot;threat of attack on my advertisers and stations&quot; had violated her First Amendment free speech rights. Media Matters said that, as the boycott was not &quot;government-sanctioned censorship&quot;, her First Amendment rights had not been violated.

===&quot;Drop Fox&quot; campaign===
During an interview in March 2011, Brock said MMfA would focus its efforts on Fox News and select conservative websites in a new strategy that Brock described as a campaign of &quot;guerrilla warfare and sabotage&quot; and a &quot;war on Fox.&quot; MMfA said the greater attention given to Fox News was part of an initiative to educate the public about what it regarded as the distortions of conservative media, and the greater attention given to Fox News was in line with its prominence. MMfA said its Drop Fox initiative, for advertisers to boycott Fox, was also part of the organization&#x27;s educational mission. MMfA said that changing Fox, not shutting it down, was its intention.

In December 2013, MMfA&#x27;s then-Executive Vice President Angelo Carusone said &quot;The war on Fox is over. And it&#x27;s not just that it&#x27;s over, but it was very successful. To a large extent, we won,&quot; claiming to have &quot;effectively discredited the network&#x27;s desire to be seen as &#x27;fair and balanced.&#x27;&quot; Around that time, Glenn Beck had departed the network and Sean Hannity&#x27;s time slot was moved from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. Other boycotts of cable news programs continued after the campaign, with PolitiFact suggesting that the boycotts are more successful in raising awareness than having an impact on the companies&#x27; bottom-line.

===Tucker Carlson audio recordings===
In March 2019, MMfA released audio recordings of Fox News host Tucker Carlson, in which he made remarks demeaning to women between 2006 and 2011 on the call-in show hosted by shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge. Among other comments, Carlson called rape shield laws &quot;unfair&quot;, defended Mormon fundamentalist church leader Warren Jeffs, who had been charged of child sexual assault, and called women &quot;extremely primitive&quot;. After Carlson&#x27;s remarks had been widely reported, Carlson tweeted: &quot;Media Matters caught me saying something naughty on a radio show more than a decade ago&quot; and declined to apologize. The following day, MMfA released a second set of audio recordings in which Carlson referred to Iraqis as &quot;semiliterate primitive monkeys&quot; and said they &quot;don&#x27;t use toilet paper or forks.&quot; Carlson also suggested that immigrants to the U.S. should be &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;really smart&quot; and that white men &quot;created civilization&quot;.

&quot;The Daily Caller&quot;, which Carlson co-founded, responded by resurfacing blog posts made by MMfA&#x27;s president Angelo Carusone. These blog posts included derogatory comments about transvestites, Jews, and people from Japan and Bangladesh. Carusone responded by saying that the posts were supposed to be a &quot;caricature of what a right wing blowhard would sound like if he was living my life&quot; and apologized for the &quot;gross&quot; remarks.

=== Misinformation on social media ===
Media Matters analyzed Donald Trump&#x27;s Facebook posts from 2020 and early 2021 and flagged 1/4 of them as containing misinformation or extremist rhetoric.

===Antisemitism on X (formerly Twitter)===
In November 2023, Media Matters published analysis indicating that advertisements of major firms such as IBM were being displayed on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) next to user posts containing antisemitic content, including praise for Adolf Hitler and Nazis. Several prominent companies suspended their advertising on the platform in reaction to the study and to some of Musk&#x27;s recent posts.

== Lawsuit and state investigations ==
On November 20, 2023, X Corp. owner Elon Musk filed a suit in a Texas court alleging Media Matters defamed the platform with the intention of hurting its advertising revenues. According to the lawsuit, Media Matters had &quot;manufactured side-by-side images depicting advertisers&#x27; posts on X Corp&#x27;s social media platform beside Neo-Nazi and white-nationalist fringe content&quot;, falsely portraying the juxtaposition as a routine occurrence on X. Media Matters called the complaint frivolous and an attempt to silence their reporting. Legal experts criticized Musk&#x27;s lawsuit, deeming it &quot;frivolous&quot; or &quot;bogus&quot;, and saying that it contradicts the First Amendment. Judge Reed O&#x27;Connor, as of October 2024, has refused calls by some legal experts to recuse himself from the case for owning Tesla stock, disputing the ruling would significantly impact Tesla&#x27;s share price. X has been described as judge shopping by seeking to settle all litigation in Reed O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s district.

On the same day that the X lawsuit was filed, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton opened an investigation into Media Matters for &quot;potentially fraudulent activity&quot;, stating that his goal was &quot;to ensure that the public has not been deceived by the schemes of radical left-wing organizations&quot;. He also urged other state attorneys general to investigate the group. Media Matters filed suit against Paxton in federal court days later, alleging he had violated the First Amendment to chill the group&#x27;s work and engaged in unlawful retaliation to punish the group. In April 2024, Judge Amit Mehta issued a preliminary injunction against Paxton&#x27;s demand for internal documents from the group. 

In December 2023, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey opened a similar investigation into Media Matters. In August 2024, a federal judge granted an injunction to halt the Missouri investigation, saying the suit was &quot;using law enforcement machinery for political ends&quot; against Media Matters, running contrary to the organization&#x27;s First Amendment rights.

==Reception==
Columnists and writers such as Paul Krugman and the late Molly Ivins cited Media Matters or identified it as a helpful source.

In 2008, columnist Jacques Steinberg of &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted David Folkenflik of National Public Radio as telling him that although Media Matters has a partisan slant they were still a useful source for leads, partly due to their broad research. Steinberg said the right already had similar outlets looking for stories and feeding them to reporters, and that Media Matters has effectively filled a void on the left. He notes that some journalists like Stuart Rothenberg prefer non-partisan sources. A 2010 opinion piece by &quot;M. S.&quot; on the blog of &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine argued that it carries no weight with conservatives due to its mostly critiquing conservative outlets.

Some object to the organization focusing its efforts to fact-check conservatives more than liberal commentators. Media Matters also received some criticism as being too supportive of Hillary Clinton before and during her 2016 presidential bid.

<text>Reading Town Football Club were a semi-professional English football club in the Hellenic League Division One East, based in Reading, Berkshire. It was affiliated to the Berks &amp; Bucks Football Association.

The club previously played in the Combined Counties Football League, but with the agreement of the leagues involved, swapped places with Badshot Lea in time for the start of the 2008–09 season.

==History==
The club was formed in 1966 as Lower Burghfield and started life in the Reading Combination League. In the early 1980s they were the Premier Division Champions on four occasions, with the 1983–84 season seeing them not just win the league, but three league cup competitions too. The next season saw them move to the Reading &amp; District League where they finished as runners-up in the Premier Division and went on to win the Reading Senior Cup. The 1985–86 season saw them once again finish as runners-up in the Premier Division, but this time around they had to settle for runners-up in the Reading Senior Cup. During their time in the Reading leagues the club changed its name several times, being known as XL United, Vincents United and finally Reading Garage.

In 1989–90 they joined the Premier Division of the Chiltonian League, and changed their name from Reading Garage to I T S Reading. In 1993–94 they changed their name to Reading Town and relocated to their final home of Scours Lane. The 1994–95 season saw the team win the Premier Division Championship, and gain promotion to the Combined Counties Football League. Their first season in the Combined counties league the club finished midtable but went on to win the Berks &amp; Bucks FA Senior Trophy, beating Lambourn Sports in the final. Floodlights were installed the following season and the team reached the final of the Berks &amp; Bucks FA Senior Trophy again, but were beaten in final by Abingdon United. That season also saw the club enter the FA Vase for the first time, where they reached the 4th Round, before succumbing to beaten semi-finalists Banstead Athletic.

The 1997–98 campaign saw the club finish as runners-up in the league, losing out to Ashford Town. That season also saw them enter the FA Cup for the first time in their history, entering at the preliminary qualification round, where they were knocked out by Waterlooville. At the start of 2001–02 season Town appointed former Manchester United and England star Neil Webb as Manager. However Webb was unable to transfer his success as a player to the management role and after a poor start to the season he resigned in November.

Twenty-three-year-old Colin Millard was made the manager for the 2002–03 campaign Town, and stayed with the club until the end of the 2006–07 to become Assistant manager at Bracknell Town. The club then appointed Neil Goff and Glenn Goudie as joint managers of the club for the 2007–08 season. Goff was the former assistant manager of Reading Town when Millard was in charge; Goudie&#x27;s previous role at the club was the goalkeeping and defensive coach, he was also the former manager of Royal Mail FC in the Reading Football League. In September 2007 Millard resigned as Assistant Manager at Bracknell Town and was re-appointed as Manager, with Goudie and Goff reverting to the position of Joint Assistant Managers.

In June 2008 Reading Town moved across leagues to join the Premier Division of the Hellenic Football League. The first season in the new league saw the club finish eighth, and win the Berks &amp; Bucks Senior Trophy again, when they beat Newport Pagnell Town in the final 2–0. The next season saw the club become runners-up of the Hellenic League Floodlit Cup and the Berks &amp; Bucks Senior Trophy, but gained some consolation by winning the Southern Combination Cup for the first time.

At the end of season Colin Millard resigned and was replaced by former Henley Town boss Roddy Slater. Roddy&#x27;s stint in charge lasted only one season and he resigned at the end of 2010–11 to be succeeded by Mark Bartley. Under Mark Bartley the club went on to win the Hellenic League Supplementary cup, beating Highmoor Ibis 4–3 in the final. At the end of the season Bartley resigned due to not wanting to work on a smaller budget for the following season. Michael Butcher was appointed as Bartleys replacement but only lasted till January 2013 when he quit as manager and former manager Colin Millard took over. In June 2013 Millard&#x27;s appointment was made permanent.

In February 2016, Reading Town were closed down by owners Battersea and Wandsworth TUC.

<text>Yohl Ikʼnal (), also known as Lady Kan Ik and Lady Kʼanal Ikʼnal, (died 7 November 604) was queen regnant of the Maya city-state of Palenque. She acceded to the throne on 23 December 583, and ruled until her death.

==Family==
Yohl Ikʼnal was a grandmother or great-grandmother of Kʼinich Janaab Pakal I, Palenque&#x27;s greatest king. She was a descendant of Kʼukʼ Bahlam I, the founder of the Palenque dynasty and she came to power within a year of the death of her predecessor, Kan Bahlam I.
She was the first female ruler in recorded Maya history and was one of a very few female rulers known from Maya history to have borne a full royal title. She must have come to the throne due to extremely unusual circumstances, the details of which have not survived. She was the one of two women to have ruled Palenque, second was her daughter or granddaughter Sak Kʼukʼ and was likely to have been either the sister or, more likely, the daughter of Kan Bahlam, who left no male heir. Her husband or her son was Janahb Pakal.

==Reign==
During the reign of Yohl Ikʼnal, Palenque suffered an important defeat by Calakmul, one of the two great Maya powers of the Classic Period. The battle took place on 23 April 599 but Yohl Ikʼnal reigned for several years more and died in 604. After the defeat, Palenque apparently maintained its political identity but Yohl Ikʼnal probably had to pay tribute to the ajaw of Calakmul. There are indications that either Yohl Ikʼnal or her successor successfully rebelled against Calakmul&#x27;s dominance before 611.

Archaeologist Merle Greene Robertson has suggested that a vaulted tomb under Temple 20 at Palenque is that of Queen Yohl Ikʼnal. She was considered important enough to be depicted twice on the sarcophagus of her grandson or great-grandson Kʼinich Janaab Pakal I and to be sculpted in stucco on the wall of his tomb.

His social and political philosophy owed much to his reading of Proudhon, Karl Marx, Giambattista Vico, Henri Bergson (whose lectures at the Collège de France he attended), and later William James. His notion of the power of myth in collective agency inspired socialists, anarchists, Marxists, and fascists. Together with his defense of violence, the power of myth is the contribution for which he is most often remembered.

Politically he evolved from his early liberal-conservative positions towards Marxism, social-democracy, and eventually syndicalism. Between 1909 and 1910 he was marginally involved with Charles Maurras&#x27; Action Française, and between 1911 and 1913 he wrote for the politically transversal &quot;L&#x27;Indépendance&quot;, established together with Édouard Berth – one of Sorel&#x27;s main disciples – and Georges Valois, closer to Maurrassian circles. After a long silence during the war, Sorel came out in favour of Lenin and moved towards Bolshevist positions until his death in 1922.

His legacy in the interwar period embraced both ends of the political spectrum, as many former syndicalists welcomed the emerging fascism. According to historian Zeev Sternhell, Sorel&#x27;s revision of Marxism broke the necessity of the link between revolution and working class, opening up the possibility of replacing the proletariat with the national community.

==Biography==
Born in Cherbourg as the son of a businessman, he moved to Paris in 1864 to attend the Collège Rollin, before entering the École Polytechnique a year later. In 1869 he became chief engineer with the Department of Public Works. Stationed in Corsica until June 1871, he was subsequently posted to various places in southern France – Albi, Gap, and Draguignan. Between 1876 and 1879 he was in Mostaganem, in colonial Algeria, before moving to Perpignan, where he spent the last years of his career until his retirement in 1892. In 1891, he was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur. Immediately after retiring, he moved with his partner Marie David to Boulogne-sur-Seine, near Paris, where he stayed until his death in 1922.

Beginning in the second half of the 1880s, he published articles in various fields (hydrology, architecture, philosophy of science, psychophysics, political history, and philosophy) displaying the influence of Aristotle, as well as those of Hippolyte Taine and Ernest Renan. In 1893, he publicly announced his position as a Marxist and a socialist. He moved to working on some of France&#x27;s first Marxist journals ( &quot;L’Ère nouvelle&quot; and &quot;Le Devenir Social)&quot; and to participating, on the revisionist side, in the debate launched by Eduard Bernstein. A supporter of Alfred Dreyfus during the &quot;affaire,&quot; Sorel later was disappointed, much like his friend Charles Péguy, by the political consequences of the trial.

In the beginning of the 20th century, he began arguing for the incompatibility between socialism and parliamentary democracy, moving towards syndicalist positions. Through his writings in Enrico Leone&#x27;s &quot;Il Divenire sociale&quot; and Hubert Lagardelle&#x27;s &quot;Mouvement socialiste&quot;, he contributed around 1905 to the theoretical elaboration of revolutionary syndicalism. In 1905, his most famous text, &quot;Reflections on Violence&quot;, began appearing in the &quot;Divenire Sociale&quot;. It was published in book form in 1908 by &quot;Pages Libres&quot;, and was followed the same year by &quot;Illusions du Progrès&quot;.

In the wake of the 1909 defeat of the syndicalist wing of the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), Sorel became close for a period in 1909–1910 with Charles Maurras’ Action française, while sharing neither its nationalism nor its political program. This collaboration inspired the founders of the Cercle Proudhon, which brought together revolutionary syndicalists and monarchists. Sorel himself, with Jean Variot, founded a journal in 1911 called &quot;L&#x27;Indépendance&quot;, although disagreements, in part over nationalism, soon ended the project.

Ferociously opposed to the 1914 Union sacrée political truce, Sorel denounced the war and in 1917 praised the Russian Revolution. He wrote for an official Soviet Union publication, , calling Lenin &quot;the greatest theoretician of socialism since Marx and a statesman whose genius recalls that of Peter the Great.&quot; He wrote numerous small pieces for Italian newspapers defending the Bolsheviks. Whereas Sorel&#x27;s support for Bolshevism is a matter of abundant public record, his much-talked-about interest in the newborn fascist movement is only confirmed by nationalist sources from the interwar period. According to the Maurrassian intellectual Jean Variot, in March 1921, Sorel confided to him that &quot;Mussolini is a man no less extraordinary than Lenin. He, too, is a political genius, of a greater reach than all the statesmen of the day, with the only exception of Lenin…&quot; Some judgments expressed in Sorel&#x27;s correspondences actually seem to contradict the belief that he was politically sympathetic with fascism. Most notably he wrote to the liberal journalist Mario Missiroli in June 1921, “Things in Italy seem to me to be going very badly [...] The disorder of the fascists, who suppress the state of which [Giolitti] claims to be the intransigent defender, could well bring Italy back to the times of the Middle Ages. It does not seem that the Fascists are more balanced than the Futurists.&quot;

==Sorel&#x27;s Marxism==
Though Sorel engaged with Marxism for virtually every one of his years as an active intellectual, his belonging to the Marxist tradition is contested. Often associated with an heroic, apocalyptic, and ultimately aesthetic Marxism, Sorel is by some (for example, Hannah Arendt, &#x27;On Violence&#x27;) thought more as a thinker of decadence. Nonetheless, analysis of his engagement with Marx show him to be preoccupied more with the epistemological subtleties of historical materialism than with an impending moral collapse. Absorbing the twin influences of Henri Bergson and Italian idealists, Sorel elaborated a Marxism rejecting economic and historical determinism, and seeing itself not as social science but as a historically-situated ideology.

=== Anti-determinism ===
Though Sorel had been a moderate conservative before turning to Marxism in the 1890s, his interest in the doctrine was dictated by scientific more than by political motivations. In a context in which Marx&#x27;s work remained relatively unknown and obscure, Sorel sought to develop the theory in order to prove that, as he wrote to Benedetto Croce in 1895, &quot;socialism is worthy of belonging to the modern scientific movement&quot;. This involved rejecting the standard French objections to Marxism: historical and economic determinism.

Through readings of Giambattista Vico and exchanges with Antonio Labriola and Benedetto Croce, Sorel came to an understanding of Marxism as a theory of class agency embedded in institutions. Given the essential creativity of the collective agency at the heart of historical development, it followed that Marxism was unable to formulate predictions based on supposed laws of historical development: &quot;History,&quot; wrote Sorel in 1897, &quot;is entirely in the past; there is no way of transforming it into a logical combination allowing us to predict the future.&quot; Moreover, the unfolding of this collective creative agency could not be entirely deduced by the material conditions in which it took place, but had to take into account legal, ideological, and cultural factors. As he wrote in 1898:Nor do I believe that it is in conformity with a Marxist spirit to decompose facts into various elements: economic ones first, subsequently juridical and political ones. ... It is in the form that the distinction can be established, but only for our intellectual necessities; in history, as well as in reason, we have unity; but in order to carry on a scientific study, it is necessary to establish classifications.

=== Reformism and syndicalism ===
These theoretical preferences yielded a mildly voluntaristic Marxism. While rejecting, first on scientific and later on political grounds, the inevitability of capitalist collapse, and arguing against the possibility of laws of history in virtue of his agency-based view of social development, he nonetheless tendentially rejected insurrectionary politics. He insisted, instead, on the institutional development of the proletariat, on the capacity of unions to become not only sites of resistance to capital, but more importantly spaces in which new, post-capitalist social relations could emerge. To reduce unions to being mere associations of resistance means opposing a formidable barrier to the development of the proletariat; it means putting it at the mercy of the influence of bourgeois demagogues; it means preventing it from elaborating the principles of a new right in line with its way of life; it is, in one word, to deny to the proletariat the possibility of becoming a class for itself.While until 1900 he had believed that this path of institutional development was best served through political engagement in parliamentary democracy, his ideas changed in the beginning of the century. Partly in reaction to the republican triumph in the 1902 French elections, and partly in virtue of new analyses on the emergence of welfare capitalism, he now believed that prolonged involvement in bourgeois parliamentarism would spell the death of the revolutionary working class. He thus elaborated a change of strategy, linked to the new circumstances. Since class is not produced by the evolution of capitalist economy, then a sustained practice of highly ideologically-charged social conflict—the grève prolétarienne—can maybe restore the conditions ideal for a revolutionary working class to thrive. As he explained in the &quot;Reflections on Violence&quot;:Marx supposed that the bourgeoisie had no need to be incited to employ force; but we are faced with a new and very unforeseen fact: a bourgeoisie which seeks to weaken its own strength. Must we believe that the Marxist conception is dead? By no means, because proletarian violence comes upon the scene at the very moment when the conception of social peace claims to moderate disputes; proletarian violence confines employers to their role as producers and tends to restore the class structure just when they seemed on the point of intermingling in the democratic morass.

==Sorel&#x27;s epistemology==
Generally seen as a representative of &quot;fin de siècle&quot; irrationalism, Sorel&#x27;s epistemological thinking is more accurately characterized as anti-positivist and increasingly moving towards a proto-pragmatist position.

=== Early epistemology ===
Though always extremely critical of mechanistic explanations and conflicted over the implications of deterministic approaches, Sorel, until the mid-1890s, was a scientific realist. As such, he argued against a conventionalist reading of the implications of non-Euclidean geometries, suggesting that geometry is an empirical and cumulative science. His early epistemological thought can be seen as an attempt to balance this scientific realism with the doubts over determinism and the desire to vindicate human agency. This act of balancing was achieved in his 1894 &quot;Ancienne et Nouvelle Métaphysique&quot;. In this text, Sorel established a dualism between a deterministic natural milieu and an essentially free artificial milieu. Science belongs to the latter, and its history testifies it: all the numerous conceptual and material tools developed by scientists to enquire upon nature, all the changes that occurred in the history of science demonstrate the human creativity and historical situatedness which lie at the heart of science. Drawing upon Henri Bergson&#x27;s Time and Free Will, he elaborated a theory of human freedom not as exemption from natural determinism but as creative capacity: &quot;We are free in the sense that we can construct tools that have no model in the cosmic environment; we do not alter the laws of nature, but we are capable of creating sequences whose ordering is our decision&quot;

At the same time, however, experimental practice provided to science an anchoring into the deterministic cosmic milieu, and hence could safeguard scientific realism. Experiments for Sorel do not correspond to natural conditions of observation: they are highly constructed observational settings which, nonetheless, allow a contact with nature and thus are suitable for the construction of predictive laws. Industrial practice is the initial setting of this experimental activity, which then moves on to greater refinement and abstraction in scientific laboratories. Through this conceptualisation of the experimental nature of science, Sorel can thus avoid the conventionalist implications to which his theory of the &quot;artificial milieu&quot; push him: &quot;I did not only say that science is social; for one could conclude that I give the name of science to a number of widespread prejudices held by everyone; I have no intention of going back to the old mistake of universal consensus.&quot;

=== Vico and social science ===
This dualistic framework resisted until Sorel attempted to tackle the epistemological issues of the human and social sciences. As long as laws could be extracted from the deterministic natural milieu, Sorel&#x27;s scientific realism was safe. But as soon as the problem of a science of society confronted him, the tensions in his epistemology reached breaking point: given that such a science must, by definition, be the science of the artificial, creatively constructed, realm, how will it be possible to extract laws from such an unpredictable environment? Sorel&#x27;s initial answer is to look for pockets of deterministic behaviour inside of the social world. Thus, in his 1892 essay on Proudhon and the science of economics, Sorel argues that while individual labour is scientifically imponderable, it assumes regular, law-like, behaviour when taken collectively, and commends Proudhon for making this point: &quot;...in the notion of value, Proudhon gets rid of all these anti-scientific elements: products are classified not according to fancies and individual claims, but according to their position in social production.&quot; He however began to express increasing uneasiness about these deterministic solutions. In his review of Émile Durkheim&#x27;s &quot;Rules of Sociological Method,&quot; he expressed serious reservations about idealtypic and statistical reasonings in the social sciences, arguing that &quot;what is striking in the human milieu is that which is human, that is to say &quot;action considered from the perspective of the agent&quot;&quot;.

To capture this collective agency in a social scientific way, Sorel had to abandon his notion of scientific explanation in terms of deterministic laws. That, he could do thanks to the reading of the work of Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico, whose epistemology of &quot;verum ipsum factum&quot; allowed Sorel to develop an alternative account of what a scientific explanation consists in. Instead of highlighting a deterministic causal nexus, explanations in the social sciences would now be concerned with accounting for how a creative agent produces. As Sorel noted, this furnishes the epistemological grounding on which a social scientific enterprise can stand, provided that it renounces notions of atemporal laws of historical development and it focuses instead on the situated, contextual, explanation of human collective agency.

=== Marxism and pragmatism ===
In the decade following the 1896 publication of his &quot;Study on Vico&quot;, Sorel was more absorbed by political and strategic considerations than by epistemological questions. Much of the anti-deterministic force of his epistemology found a fruitful channel of expression in Sorel&#x27;s efforts to revise Marxism in a more agency-oriented fashion. Nonetheless, as early as the &quot;Study on Vico&quot;, he had become aware of the relativistic implications of his epistemology:Thus ideal history has perished, overcome by the development of historical research. It is now nothing but a memory... In natural science as well there is a similar sort of problem that contemporary philosophy has shown itself equally powerless to resolve. Critique of the idea of divinity has shaken the foundations of all knowledge that drew its certitude from the ancient idea of “God in nature.” Science no longer seems, today, safe from contingency, the fixed point has disappeared. It is enough to read the titles of contemporary theses on understanding and contingency to understand how it preoccupies reflective minds. Neither does it seem easy to respond to those who want to know where law [droit] finds its place in materialist conceptions of history. The difficulty is the same as above: law that is immutable and rests in the divine Idea has disappeared as has science possessed totally by God. Nothing is served by denying the difficulties that result from these new principles, but this is not a reason to revive famously incorrect doctrines.By the end of the first decade of the century, Sorel encounters American pragmatism, which he initially looked to with suspicion. In the first edition of his &quot;Illusions of Progress&quot;, he calls pragmatism the &quot;last term of bourgeois philosophy&quot;, adding that its popularity was due to its &quot;flexibility, its garrulousness, and the cynicism of its success&quot;. Soon enough, however, a more in-depth acquaintance with the work of William James changed Sorel&#x27;s opinion. He started calling himself a pragmatist and tried to remedy some of the relativistic consequences of James&#x27; theory of truth. His last major work in the philosophy of science was called the &quot;Utility of Pragmatism&quot;. In it, Sorel sketched a theory of knowledge as always and irredemably situated, going close to denying the possibility of knowledge of the natural milieu. &quot;For some time now, a number of distinguished men of learning have observed that their studies examined not so much a world which is given to man, but that which man creates in the world. Many of those who have reflected on this situation have concluded that since it is not possible to apprehend &quot;natural nature&quot;, one must be happy with insights capable of charming the imagination, with conventions useful to give a clear exposition of facts, or with empirical rules convenient for improving the practice of the usual arts. We would thus be condemned to abandon the idea of certainty which dominated ancient science. But the pragmatist declares that &quot;artificial nature&quot; interests our life at least as much as &quot;natural nature&quot;. He admires its fecondity, which appears to him as infinitely growing. He asks himself how man can have such nonsensical ambitions to believe that &quot;artificial nature&quot; would not suffice to fully occupy his genius.&quot;

<text>The olfactory epithelium is a specialized epithelial tissue inside the nasal cavity that is involved in smell. In humans, it measures
 and lies on the roof of the nasal cavity about above and behind the nostrils. The olfactory epithelium is the part of the olfactory system directly responsible for detecting odors.

==Structure==
Olfactory epithelium consists of four distinct cell types:
* Olfactory sensory neurons 
* Supporting cells
* Basal cells
* Brush cells

===Olfactory sensory neurons===
The olfactory receptor neurons are sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium. They are bipolar neurons and their apical poles express odorant receptors on non-motile cilia at the ends of the dendritic knob, which extend out into the airspace to interact with odorants. Odorant receptors bind odorants in the airspace, which are made soluble by the serous secretions from olfactory glands located in the lamina propria of the mucosa. The axons of the olfactory sensory neurons congregate to form the olfactory nerve (CN I). Once the axons pass through the cribriform plate, they terminate and synapse with the dendrites of mitral cells in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb.

===Supporting cells===

Analogous to neural glial cells, the supporting cells are non-neural cells in the olfactory epithelium that are located in the apical layer of the pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. There are two types of supporting cells in the olfactory epithelium: sustentacular cells and microvillar cells. The sustentacular cells function as metabolic and physical support for the olfactory epithelium. Microvillar cells are another class of supporting cells that are morphologically and biochemically distinct from the sustentacular cells, and arise from a basal cell population that expresses the c-KIT cell surface protein.

===Basal cells===

Resting on or near the basal lamina of the olfactory epithelium, basal cells are stem cells capable of division and differentiation into either supporting or olfactory cells. While some of these basal cells divide rapidly, a significant proportion remain relatively quiescent and replenish olfactory epithelial cells as needed. This leads to the olfactory epithelium being replaced every 6–8 weeks.

Basal cells can be divided on the basis of their cellular and histological features into two populations: the horizontal basal cells, which are slowly dividing reserve cells that express p63; and globose basal cells, which are a heterogeneous population of cells consisting of reserve cells, amplifying progenitor cells, and immediate precursor cells.

===Brush cells===

A brush cell is a microvilli-bearing columnar cell with its basal surface in contact with afferent nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) and is specialized for transduction of general sensation.

===Olfactory (Bowman&#x27;s) glands===
Tubuloalveolar serous secreting glands lying in the lamina propria of the olfactory mucosa. These glands deliver a proteinaceous secretion via ducts onto the surface of the mucosa. The role of the secretions are to trap and dissolve odiferous substances for the bipolar neurons. Constant flow from the olfactory glands allows old odors to be constantly washed away.

==Development==
The olfactory epithelium derives from two structures during embryonic development: the nasal placodes, which were long believed to be its sole origin; and neural crest cells, whose contributions have been identified more recently through fate mapping studies.

The embryonic olfactory epithelium consists of fewer cell types than in the adult, including apical and basal progenitor cells, as well as immature olfactory sensory neurons. Early embryonic neurogenesis relies mostly on the apical cells, while later stage embryonic neurogenesis and secondary neurogenesis in adults relies on basal stem cells. The axons of the immature olfactory sensory neurons, along with a mixed population of migratory cells, including immature olfactory ensheathing cells and gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons form a &quot;migratory mass&quot; that travels towards the olfactory bulb. At the end of the embryonic stage, the epithelium develops into a pseudostratified columnar epithelium and begins secondary neurogenesis.

=== Olfactory placode ===
Neurogenic placodes are transient, focal aggregations of ectoderm located in the developmental region of the future vertebrate head, and give rise to sensory organs. Early cranial sensory placodes are marked by expression of Six1, part of the Six family of transcription factors that regulate the preplacodal specification. The olfactory placode forms as two thickenings of non-neural region of embryonic ectoderm. In mice, the olfactory placode derives from an anterior portion of the neural tube, ~9-9.5 days into development and not long after the closure of the neural plate. Development of the olfactory placode requires the presence underlying neural crest-derived mesenchymal tissue. The specification of the olfactory placode tissue involves signaling of multiple gene networks, beginning with signals from bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), retinoic acid (RA), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), specifically FGF8. The resulting regulated downstream expression of transcription factors, such as Pax6, Dlx3, Sox2, and others, within the presumptive olfactory placode are crucial for sub-regionalization within the future olfactory epithelium and is responsible for the diversity of cells that compose the future epithelium.

Similar to the other embryonic placodes, the olfactory placode gives rise to both neural and non-neural structures, ultimately resulting in the formation of the nasal epithelium. The specification of neural versus non-neural tissue involves signals both within the olfactory placode, and between the olfactory placode and the underlying mesenchymal compartment. Continued signaling by BMP, FGF, and RA, the morphogens that initially induced placode formation, collectively coordinate the patterning of olfactory placode tissue into the future distinct cell types that make up the olfactory epithelium. The cell types derived from the olfactory placode include:
* Neural: olfactory sensory neurons, LHRH-secreting neurons, and ganglion cells
* Non-neuronal: basal cells, olfactory supporting cells, ciliated cells, Bowman’s glands, Schwann cells, submucosal glands, and brush cells
However, there is significant evidence for an additional neural crest-origin for many of these cell types as well.

=== Olfactory sensory neuron development ===
Olfaction results from the proper development and interaction of the two components of the primary olfactory pathway: the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. The olfactory epithelium contains olfactory sensory neurons, whose axons innervate the olfactory bulb. In order for olfactory sensory neurons to function properly, they must express odorant receptors and the proper transduction proteins on non-motile cilia that extend from the dendritic knob in addition to projecting their axons to the olfactory bulb.

The cells of the olfactory epithelium, including olfactory sensory neurons, begin to differentiate soon after the induction of the olfactory placode. Once the olfactory sensory neurons differentiate, they express odorant receptors, which transduce odorant information from the environment to the central nervous system and aids in the development of the odorant map. The differentiated olfactory sensory neurons extend pioneering axons, which follow guidance cues released by the underlying mesenchyme, as well as other chemotrophic cues released from the telencephalon. As development of the olfactory pathway progresses, more axons innervate the olfactory bulb, which develops from the rostral-most region of telencephalon. The organization and subsequent processing of odorant information is possible due to the convergence of olfactory sensory neuron axons expressing the same odorant receptors onto the same glomerulus at the olfactory bulb.

== Clinical significance==
The olfactory epithelium can be damaged by inhalation of toxic fumes, physical injury to the interior of the nose, and possibly by the use of some nasal sprays. Because of its regenerative capacity, damage to the olfactory epithelium can be temporary but in extreme cases, injury can be permanent, leading to anosmia.

<text>Morphological analysis or general morphological analysis is a method for exploring possible solutions to a multi-dimensional, non-quantified complex problem. It was developed by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky. General morphology has found use in fields including engineering design, technological forecasting, organizational development and policy analysis.

==Overview==
General morphology was developed by Fritz Zwicky, the Bulgarian-born, Swiss-national astrophysicist based at the California Institute of Technology. Among others, Zwicky applied morphological analysis to astronomical studies and jet and rocket propulsion systems. As a problem-structuring and problem-solving technique, morphological analysis was designed for multi-dimensional, non-quantifiable problems where causal modelling and simulation do not function well, or at all. 

Zwicky developed this approach to address seemingly non-reducible complexity: using the technique of cross-consistency assessment (CCA), the system allows for reduction by identifying the possible solutions that actually exist, eliminating the illogical solution combinations in a grid box rather than reducing the number of variables involved.
==Decomposition versus morphological analysis==
Problems that involve many governing factors, where most of them cannot be expressed numerically can be well suited for morphological analysis. 

The conventional approach is to break a complex system into parts, isolate the parts (dropping the &#x27;trivial&#x27; elements) whose contributions are critical to the output and solve the simplified system for desired scenarios. The disadvantage of this method is that many real-world phenomena do not have obviously trivial elements and cannot be simplified.

Morphological analysis works backwards from the output towards the system internals without a simplification step. The system&#x27;s interactions are fully accounted for in the analysis.

<doc id="640821" wikidata="Q223529" url="?curid=640821" title="Symphony No. 3 (Prokofiev)">
<text>Sergei Prokofiev wrote his Symphony No. 3 in C minor, Op. 44, in 1928.

==Background==
The music derives from Prokofiev&#x27;s opera &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot;, a touching love story set against the backdrop of demonic possession. This opera had been accepted for performance in the 1927–28 season at the Berlin State Opera by Bruno Walter, but this production never materialised; in fact, the opera was never staged in Prokofiev&#x27;s lifetime. Prokofiev, who had been working on the opera for years, was reluctant to let the music languish unperformed, and after hearing a concert performance of its second act given by Serge Koussevitzky in June 1928, he adapted parts of the opera to make his third symphony (shortly afterwards, he drew on his ballet &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; for his Symphony No. 4 in similar fashion). The symphony, which was dedicated to Nikolai Myaskovsky was premiered on 17 May 1929 by Pierre Monteux conducting the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris.

==Movements==

The symphony is in four movements, lasting around 30–35 minutes.
# Moderato
# Andante
# Allegro agitato — Allegretto
# Andante mosso — Allegro moderato

Though the music of the symphony is based on that of the opera, the material is developed symphonically; the symphony is therefore absolute rather than programmatic.

The first movement, in traditional sonata form, opens with clashing chords played by the whole orchestra, along with tolling bells, setting a mood of threat and unrest. An impassioned first theme enters on strings, while a melancholy second theme on bassoons and lower strings provides contrast. The climactic development section follows, finding space for a third theme, which eventually combines with the first two themes. After a grave climax with gigantic orchestral chords and a last &quot;struggle&quot; in marching rhythms, the ethereal recapitulation ensues, in which the first and second themes are integrated, although much reduced and played softer, as if only the shadow of what was before remains.

The second movement, a meditative andante with a ternary structure, displays Prokofiev&#x27;s talent in creating fragile, gossamer textures. The central section is more brooding in nature, with the theme consisting of semitones.

In the third movement, we hear hybrid elements from both of the movements that preceded it: though the textures are lighter than in the first movement, the sense of foreboding is back, as dithering strings create a chilling effect. They are intensified by insistent announcements from the brass choir and bass drum.

Finally, in the fourth movement, Prokofiev reprises musical materials from earlier in the symphony, beginning at a comfortable andante pace and gradually accelerating. The themes of the opening movement are threaded into the narrative before the Third comes to rest on a fearsome juggernaut of violent chords.

==Instrumentation==
The work is scored for the following:

Woodwind
*Piccolo
*2 Flutes
*2 Oboes

<doc id="640822" wikidata="Q1334327" url="?curid=640822" title="United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI)">
<text>The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, also known as the Resolution on Admitting Peking, was passed in response to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1668 that required any change in China&#x27;s representation in the UN be determined by a two-thirds vote referring to Article 18 of the UN Charter. The resolution, passed on 25 October 1971, recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) as &quot;the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations&quot; and removed &quot;the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek&quot; (referring to the then-authoritarian Kuomintang regime as the dominant party in the Republic of China, whose central government had retreated to Taiwan from the mainland) from the United Nations.

In the 2020s, disputes over the interpretation of the resolution have arisen, with Taiwan, the United States, Canada, the European Union, United Kingdom and Australia disagreeing with the PRC&#x27;s interpretation about conflating the resolution with its One China principle and using it against Taiwan&#x27;s right of participation in international organizations.

==Background==
The Republic of China (ROC) was founded in 1912 in Mainland China, and expanded its jurisdiction to Taiwan in 1945. In 1945, it became one of the 51 original member states of the United Nations, which was created in 1945. At that time, however, it was embroiled in civil war: the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, was fighting troops led by the Chinese Communist Party. This lasted until 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing and the Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, from which Japan had withdrawn in 1945 and to which it would in 1951 renounce all right, title and claim. By January 1950 the PRC was in control of mainland China but was unable to capture Taiwan, Penghu, Matsu or Kinmen, and thus these remained Kuomintang-ruled.

Although the ROC government continuously claimed to one day return to its mainland, by the 1970s, an increasing number of UN members became aware that this government no longer represented the hundreds of million people who lived on the mainland. The PRC claimed to be the successor government of the ROC, while the Kuomintang in Taiwan championed the continued existence of the Republic of China. Both claimed to be the only legitimate Chinese government, and each refused to maintain diplomatic relations with countries that have recognized the other. The ROC continued to represent China in the UN until Resolution 2758 was passed.

==Proceedings at the United Nations==
On 15 July 1971, 17 UN members: Albania, Algeria, the Congo, Cuba, Guinea, Iraq, Mali, Mauritania, North Yemen, Romania, Somalia, South Yemen, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Yugoslavia, and Zambia, requested that a question of the &quot;Restoration of the lawful rights of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the United Nations&quot; be placed on the provisional agenda of the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. In an explanatory memorandum accompanying their request, the 17 UN members observed that for years they had protested against what they considered were hostile and discriminatory policy followed by several governments with regard to the communist government of mainland China, which they considered to be the genuine representative of the Chinese people. The existence of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, they declared, was a reality which could &quot;not be changed to suit the myth of a so called &quot;Republic of China&quot;, fabricated out of a portion of Chinese territory&quot;. In the view of the 17 UN members, the ROC were unlawful authorities installed in the island of Taiwan which claimed to represent China, and they remained there only because of the permanent presence of United States Armed Forces. No important international problems, they added, could be solved without the participation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It was in the fundamental interests, they concluded, of the United Nations to &quot;restore&quot; promptly to the People&#x27;s Republic of China its seat in the organization, thus putting an end to a &quot;grave injustice&quot; and &quot;dangerous situation&quot; which had been perpetuated in order to fulfill a policy that had been increasingly repudiated. This meant the immediate expulsion of the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek regime from the seat which it held in the United Nations.

On 17 August 1971, the United States requested that a second item, &quot;The representation of China in the United Nations&quot; also be placed on the provisional agenda. In the explanatory memorandum accompanying the U.S. request, the U.S. said that in dealing with the problem of the representation of China, the United Nations should take cognizance of the existence of both the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of China; it should reflect that incontestable reality in the manner in which it made provision for China&#x27;s representation. The U.S. asserted that the UN should not be required to take a definitive position on the respective conflicting claims of the People&#x27;s Republic of China or the Republic of China, pending a peaceful resolution of the matter as called for by the United Nations Charter. Thus, the U.S. added, the People&#x27;s Republic of China should be represented and at the same time provision should be made to ensure that the Republic of China was not deprived of its representation.

On 22 September 1971, the United States proposed at the UN General Committee that the two items be combined into one item called &quot;The Question of China&quot;. The proposal was, however, rejected by 12 votes to 9 with 3 abstentions.

On 25 September 1971, the first Albanian-backed draft resolution, &quot;A/L.630 and Add.1 and 2&quot;, was submitted by 23 states including 17 of the states which had joined in placing the question on the agenda, to: &quot;...restore to the People&#x27;s Republic of China all its rights and expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek.&quot;

On 29 September 1971, a second draft resolution, &quot;A/L.632 and Add.1 and 2&quot;, sponsored by 22 members including the U.S., was proposed declaring that any proposal to deprive the Republic of China of representation was an important question under of the UN Charter, and thus would require a two-thirds supermajority for approval.

On 29 September 1971, a third draft resolution, &quot;A/L.633&quot;, sponsored by 19 members including the U.S., was proposed by which the Assembly would affirm the right of representation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and recommend that it be seated as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, while also affirming the continuing right of representation of the Republic of China.

On 15 October 1971 the representatives of 22 UN members requested the UN Secretary-General to distribute, as an official Assembly document, a statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People&#x27;s Republic of China dated 20 August 1971. In this statement, made in response to the U.S. letter of 17 August 1971 and its accompanying explanatory memorandum, the People&#x27;s Republic of China declared that the U.S. proposal was a blatant exposure of the Nixon government&#x27;s scheme of creating &quot;two Chinas&quot; in the United Nations. It added that there was only one China, the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Taiwan, it continued, was an inalienable part of Chinese territory and a province of China which had already been returned to the motherland after the Second World War. It went on to state that the U.S. was plotting to separate Taiwan from China and was wildly attempting to force members of the UN to submit to its will. The Chinese government declared that the Chinese people and government firmly opposed &quot;two Chinas&quot;, &quot;one China, one Taiwan&quot;, or any other similar arrangement, as well as the claim that &quot;the status of Taiwan remains to be determined&quot;. They declared they would have absolutely nothing to do with the UN in such scenarios.

Discussion at the Assembly took place at 12 plenary meetings between 18 and 26 October 1971 with 73 member states taking part. During the debates four more draft resolutions were submitted - three by Tunisia and one by Saudi Arabia. Broadly, each of these draft resolutions was a variation on the third draft resolution described above, backed by the U.S. Notably, the Saudi-proposed resolution would have held that the people of the island of Taiwan had a right to self-determination. Similarly, the Tunisian resolution would have called for the Republic of China government to be represented in the United Nations under the name &quot;&quot;.

Algeria&#x27;s representative in the debates submitted that to recognize that the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was lawfully entitled to represent China did not imply the eviction of a member but the eviction of the representatives of a dissident minority regime. The U.S., in its submission, took the opposite view; arguing that adoption of the resolution expelling the representatives sent from Taipei would imply the termination of the membership of a longstanding member. The spokesman of the Republic of China submitted that his country had earned its place in the United Nations by virtue of its contribution to peace and freedom during the Second World War. He said the Chinese communist regime, which had never had the moral consent of the Chinese people, could in no way be regarded as the representative of the great Chinese nation. Various members including two permanent members of the security council, the United Kingdom and the USSR, argued that requiring the matter to be subject to a supermajority vote was not appropriate because the adoption of the Albanian proposed resolution did not involve the admission or expulsion of a member. Rather it concerned only credentials and Taiwan had never been a member. They argued there was only one Chinese state that was a member. Any other Chinese state would have to apply for membership in accordance with the Charter.

On 25 October 1971, the voting took place. In the first vote held, the Assembly rejected the U.S. backed proposal that the matter would require a supermajority vote — the &#x27;important question motion&#x27; &quot;[A/L.632 and Add.1 and 2]&quot;. The Assembly then voted on a separate U.S. proposal that the words &quot;and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupied at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it&quot; be removed from the draft resolution &quot;A/L.630 and Add.1 and 2&quot;. The U.S. representative suggested that this motion, if adopted, would &quot;have the effect of welcoming the PRC to the General Assembly and the Security Council, while at the same time not affecting the representation of the ROC in this hall&quot;. The motion was rejected by a vote of 61 to 51, with 16 abstentions.

At this point the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the ROC, Chow Shu-Kai, stated &quot;in view of the frenzied and irrational manners that have been exhibited in this hall, the delegation of the Republic of China has now decided not to take part in any further proceedings of this General Assembly.&quot; He said the &quot;ideals upon which the United Nations was founded and which the General Assembly has now been betrayed&quot;.

The Assembly then adopted draft Albanian proposed resolution &quot;A/L.630 and Add.1 and 2&quot;, by a roll-call vote of 76 to 35, with 17 abstentions, as Resolution 2758. The Beijing government began representing China at the UN from 15 November 1971 and its delegates were seated at the UN Security Council meeting held on 23 November 1971, the first such meeting where representatives of the Beijing government represented China.

=== United Nations ===
On 21 September 2007, the UN General Assembly rejected Taiwan&#x27;s membership bid to &quot;join the UN under the name of Taiwan&quot;, citing Resolution 2758 as acknowledging that Taiwan is part of China. The UN General Assembly and its General Committee&#x27;s recommendations on the &quot;Taiwan question&quot; reflected long-standing UN policy and is mirrored in other documents promulgated by the United Nations. For example, the UN&#x27;s &quot;Final Clauses of Multilateral Treaties, Handbook&quot; (2003) states:

...regarding the Taiwan Province of China, the Secretary-General follows the General Assembly’s guidance incorporated in resolution 2758 (XXVI) of the General Assembly of 25 October 1971 on the restoration of the lawful rights of the People’s Republic of China in the United Nations. The General Assembly decided to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. Hence, instruments received from the Taiwan Province of China will not be accepted by the Secretary-General in his capacity as depositary.

It has often been noted that Article 23 of the UN Charter states, &quot;The Republic of China, France [...] shall be permanent members of the Security Council.&quot; Similarly, Article 110 specifies that &quot;The present Charter shall come into force upon the deposit of ratifications by the Republic of China [...]&quot; These provisions remain valid to this day, despite Taiwan&#x27;s withdrawal.

According to academic Margaret Lewis of Seton Hall University School of Law, the resolution over the representation in the UN has been widely interpreted to support China&#x27;s claim over Taiwan. It has effectively blocked Taiwan from joining the UN and its subsidiary organizations, although it literally did not block Taiwan from participating in the UN.

=== China ===

The Chinese government claims that Resolution 2758 also represented a process to rule out the ambiguity of Taiwan&#x27;s status in the debates at the UN General Assembly, where the admission of the People&#x27;s Republic of China to the UN was not considered a question of new membership, but a question of credentials, or who represented China to the UN. After 1949, Taiwan was regarded as the rump state of the Republic of China, which had lost control of most of its mainland territory, rendering it unable to represent China internationally—a position solidified by Resolution 2758.

The Chinese government insists that the term &quot;China&quot; in Resolution 2758 also refers to Taiwan. Yang Tao, a senior Chinese diplomat, asserted that People&#x27;s Republic of China had replaced the Republic of China as the representation of China since its foundation in 1949. He noted that Resolution 2758, passed by a majority vote, recognised the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China, and did not acknowledge any other representation of China or Taiwan. Yang contended that if China&#x27;s representation did not include Taiwan, there would have been no need to expel the representative of Chiang Kai-shek. Beijing asserts that Taiwan falls completely within China&#x27;s international law identity, without any need to mention Taiwan separately, according to state media outlet &quot;China Daily&quot;.

Beijing states that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation affirmed Taiwan&#x27;s return to China, while acknowledging that the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty did not explicitly address Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty. Chinese diplomats criticised the United States for disregarding the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation in which they believed that the United States had agreed on the return of Taiwan to China. The Chinese government also claims that it reached a consensus with Taiwan in 1992, in which both China and Taiwan agreed that there is but one China across the Taiwan strait. China set this consensus as a premise to engage any official interaction with Taiwan.

For decades, China has been poaching Taiwan&#x27;s diplomatic allies based on one-China principles, as a tool to pressure Taiwan. In early 2024, Nauru was the first country to cite Resolution 2758 for cutting its diplomatic tie with Taiwan and building a formal relation with China. The official Xinhua News Agency noted that China established diplomatic ties with 183 countries on the condition of its one-China principle.

=== Taiwan ===
In 2000, Taiwanese foreign minister Tien Hung-mao addressed to the Legislative Yuan that the Republic of China was a founding member of the United Nations, yet Resolution 2758, which addressed the representation of the people of the Mainland Area, excluded the representation of the people of the Taiwan Area, a situation he found inappropriate. Tien noted that if Taiwan seeks to join the UN as a new member, its application would likely face a veto from China and objections from other UN Security Council members. Alternatively, if Taiwan aims to rejoin the UN, it must overturn Resolution 2758, which requires a two-thirds majority vote in the UN General Assembly—a highly challenging objective to achieve.

The Pan-Green Coalition, led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), believes that Resolution 2758 has been distorted by China and aim to return to the UN as Taiwan, while the Kuomintang (KMT)-led Pan-Blue Coalition is against the resolution itself and aims to amend the resolution to allow the Republic of China to return to the UN. The two camps are also divided on whether there is a consensus in 1992. President Ma Ying-jeou from KMT accepted this consensus during his administration, while the consensus was later denied by President Tsai Ing-wen from the DPP who questioned whether such consensus ever actually taken place in the meetings. 

Two referendums were held in 2008 to determine whether the country should re-join the UN as the Republic of China or join the UN as Taiwan. Both referendums failed to meet the required voter turnout. A United States Department of State spokesman warned such referendums may alter the status quo of Taiwan, breaking the promises that Chen made to President George W. Bush. Since 2009, Taiwan has not submitted requests for UN membership, but continues to protest its exclusion from the UN system through other countries.

In September 2024, Taiwan intended to draw intention to the Chinese distortion of Resolution 2758 with the goal of rejoining the UN. Several DPP legislators urged the Legislative Yuan to declare that Resolution 2758 does not concern Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty or international status. The DPP legislators attempted to make an interim motion, which was, however, ignored by the president of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-yu from the KMT, throughout the parliamentary session.

=== United States ===
The US&#x27;s official policy is to recognize the PRC government as &quot;the sole legal government of China&quot;, and &quot;it acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China&quot;. While the United States acknowledges the Chinese position, it does not explicitly state agreement with the position. According to a 2014 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, the US administrations have not explicitly stated a position on the political status of Taiwan.

In April 2024, US State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Mark Lambert spoke at a German Marshall Fund (GMF) seminar, saying that &quot;Resolution 2758 does not endorse, is not equivalent to, and does not reflect a consensus for the PRC&#x27;s &#x27;one China&#x27; principle&quot;. Lambert added that the Chinese government &quot;mischaracterizes the resolution by falsely conflating it with China’s ‘one China’ principle and wrongly asserts that it reflects an international consensus for its ‘one China’ principle.&quot; In May 2024, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that the US&#x27;s &#x27;one China&#x27; policy &quot;has not changed&quot;.

According to some analysts at the GMF, Resolution 2758 solved the issue of &quot;China&#x27;s representation&quot; in the United Nations—but it left the issue of Taiwan&#x27;s representation unresolved.

While keeping diplomatic relations with the PRC, the US expects that &quot;the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means&quot;. The US &quot;would continue to maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan&quot;. In February 2025, a group of U.S. congressional representatives introduced a non-binding resolution that rejected the PRC&#x27;s use of Resolution 2758, which it stated had been &quot;weaponized.&quot;

=== Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China ===
In July 2024, at the first Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China summit in Taiwan, attending lawmakers agreed on a resolution to counter China&#x27;s interpretation of Resolution 2758 in their home country legislatures.

=== Australia ===

In August 2024, the Parliament of Australia formally condemned China&#x27;s use of UN Resolution 2758. The parliament declared that UN Resolution 2758, &quot;does not establish the People’s Republic of China&#x27;s sovereignty over Taiwan and does not determine the future status of Taiwan in the UN&quot;.

=== Netherlands ===
In September 2024, the House of Representatives recognized that UN Resolution 2758 does not judge Taiwan&#x27;s future participation in the UN or other international organizations, and also does not support China&#x27;s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. The vote of 147 to 3 rejects China&#x27;s interpretation of the resolution in its claims over Taiwan and calls for an EU-wide effort to support Taiwan&#x27;s representation.

=== European Union ===
In October 2024, the European Parliament recognized that Resolution 2758 does not take a position on Taiwan, has no bearing on Taiwan&#x27;s participation in UN bodies, and that China&#x27;s coercive measure to achieve unification are contradictory to international law. The European Commission stated that it opposes &quot;any unilateral actions that change the status quo by force or coercion.&quot;

=== Canada ===
In November 2024, the House of Commons of Canada unanimously passed a motion stating that Resolution 2758 did not establish Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan and had no bearing on Taiwan&#x27;s future participation in UN bodies.

=== United Kingdom ===
In November 2024, the House of Commons of the United Kingdom unanimously passed a motion stating that Resolution 2758 does not address the political status of Taiwan, does not establish PRC sovereignty over Taiwan, and is silent on Taiwan&#x27;s participation in UN bodies.

<text>Cornerhouse was a cinema and contemporary visual arts centre next to Oxford Road Station on Oxford Street, Manchester, England, from 1985 to 2015. It had three floors of art galleries, three cinemas, a bookshop, bar and café. Cornerhouse was operated by Greater Manchester Arts Centre Ltd, a registered charity.

==The buildings==
Cornerhouse occupied two buildings. The main building, 70 Oxford Street, was built for John Shaw in the early 1900s and was a furniture store run by the family until it closed in 1985. The building on the other side of the approach to Oxford Road station was designed by Peter Cummings, was completed in 1934 and opened as a cinema, Tatler News Theatre, in May 1935. The cinema had numerous name changes (Essoldo, Tatler Classic, Tatler Cinema Club) before closing in 1981.

==History==

Cornerhouse was conceived by the Greater Manchester Visual Arts Trust, chaired by Sir Bob Scott. It opened with the support of the then Greater Manchester County Council and Manchester City Council, North West Arts Association (now part of Arts Council England) and the British Film Institute.

Cornerhouse&#x27;s first director was Dewi Lewis, who had previously been director of Bury Metro Arts. The building opened on 3 October 1985. The first film screened (on 18 October) was Nic Roeg&#x27;s &quot;Insignificance&quot;. Dave Moutrey was director and CEO from 1998 until 2024.

Since its inception, Cornerhouse has hosted the UK premiere of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and was the first UK public gallery to commission work from Damien Hirst.

In 2012, it was announced that Cornerhouse would merge with the Library Theatre Company to form HOME. In 2015, both organisations moved to new premises at the HOME centre.

From March 2017 to August 2017, the vacant Cornerhouse Cinema building was squatted by the Loose Space Collective before being evicted.

==Programme==
The Cornerhouse offered independent cinema, and contemporary art in the galleries. Cornerhouse&#x27;s contemporary visual art programme was dedicated to launching artists who had not received major institutional recognition in Britain. It also let mid-career artists realise new projects in commissions and exhibitions on and off-site. The visual arts programme presented works in all media, with an emphasis on film and video that has a strong link with the film programme.

Cornerhouse produced or co-produced all of its exhibitions as well as a programme for each show. A regular feature of its visual arts programme was international group exhibitions which explored socio-political concerns. In 2011, Cornerhouse launched Artist Film, a project for the production and distribution of longer films, starting with Gillian Wearing&#x27;s &quot;Self Made&quot;. Cornerhouse was a partner in the plus Tate programme.

On average, 30 titles were screened across the three screens every month. The cinemas were open seven days a week, with daily matinée and evening performances (no matinées on Monday), making a total of almost 3,500 screenings annually.

Cornerhouse&#x27;s film programme was international in scope and offered new and innovative film and video alongside more familiar work. This resulted in the screening of new films and re-releases; second runs of overlooked or underrated titles; classic and archive material; shorts, animation and documentary; avant garde film and television; and foreign language films. Alongside a variety of touring film programmes, Cornerhouse also ran two festivals every year &quot;¡Viva! Spanish&quot; and Latin American Film Festival and &quot;exposures&quot;.

==Books==

In 1987, Dewi Lewis launched the Cornerhouse Publications imprint with &quot;A Green and Pleasant Land&quot; by John Davies. Cornerhouse Publications was joint winner of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Small Publisher of The Year Award in 1990. The imprint continued to be active until 1994 and over the period published books by many major international photographers.

== Family ==
Ahkal Moʼ Nahb I is the earliest recorded ruler of Palenque whose exact dates of birth, accession and death have been verified. He was possibly the younger brother of his immediate predecessor, Bʼutz Aj Sak Chiik. For unknown reasons Ahkal Moʼ Nahbʼ is mentioned several times in official narratives left by Pacal the Great, who ruled Palenque a century later. It is believed Pacal considered Ahkal Moʼ Naabʼ I a particularly important historical figure or his ancestor.

<text>appear in Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1904) as corpse-eating spirits. In Japanese Buddhism, &quot;jikininki&quot; (&quot;human-eating ghosts&quot;; pronounced &quot;shokujinki&quot; in modern Japanese), are similar to &quot;Gaki&quot;/&quot;Hungry ghost&quot;; the spirits of greedy, selfish or impious individuals who are cursed after death to seek out and eat humans and human corpses. 

A similar story can be found as &quot;Aozukin&quot; in Ueda Akinari&#x27;s &quot;Ugetsu Monogatari&quot; from 1776.

==Story==
It is said that there was a monk/priest, named Muso, who was traveling alone through the mountains in the Mino prefecture of Japan, when he lost his way. It was almost dark when he saw, up on a hill, an old , the home of solitary priests. He walked to the top of the hill and asked the inhabitant if he could stay the night. The only inhabitant was an old priest, who harshly refused Muso lodgings for the night; however, he told Muso that he could find food and a place to sleep down in a hamlet, nearby. 

Muso found the hamlet, where the headman welcomed him and promptly supplied him food and a place to sleep. A little before midnight that night, Muso was awakened by a young man, one of the villagers, who informed him that, earlier that day, before Muso had arrived, his father had died. The young man had not told Muso earlier so he would not feel embarrassed or obliged to participate in ceremonies. However, the entire village was now leaving their homes for a nearby village, as it was custom to leave the corpse alone for the night or else bad things would befall the village inhabitants. As a priest, Muso told the young man he would do his duty and perform the burial services and stay the night with the corpse. He was not afraid of the demons or evil spirits the young man spoke of. 

When the young man and the other villagers had left, Muso knelt by the corpse and the offerings and began the service. In the deepest part of the night, &quot;Ushi no toki mairi&quot;, a shapeless being entered, while Muso was deep in meditation. Muso could not speak or move as he watched the shapeless being devour the corpse and the offerings. The next morning when the villagers had returned, Muso told the young man what had happened. The young man was not surprised. 

Muso then asked the young man why the priest up on the nearby hill did not do the ceremony. Confused, the young man told Muso that there was no priest who lived nearby and that there hadn&#x27;t been for many years. When Muso spoke of the &quot;Anjitsu&quot;, the young man also denied its existence. Muso then departed from the village, now with proper directions to continue his journey. 

Before he left the area, Muso sought out the &quot;Anjitsu&quot; and the old priest living within it upon the hilltop to see if he had indeed been mistaken. He found the hill and &quot;Anjitsu&quot; easily, and the old priest let him inside this time. The old priest then began to apologize for displaying his true form in front of Muso; he was the shapeless figure who had devoured the corpse in front of Muso the night-before. The old priest went on to explain that he was now a &quot;Jikininki&quot; and how he had come to be one; after living a long, selfish life as a priest, only caring about the food and clothes his services had brought him-even at the expense of others in more need of them then he had been-after his death, the old priest had been reborn into the world as a &quot;Jikininki&quot;, doomed to feed upon the fresh corpses of others. The old priest then pleaded with Muso to perform a &quot;Segaki&quot; Requiem service for him, so that he could finally escape his horrible existence as a &quot;Jikininki&quot;. As Muso performed the service, all of a sudden the old priest disappeared along with the &quot;Anjitsu&quot;. Muso found himself kneeling in the long grass upon the top of a hill before a tombstone of a priest and the ruins of the &quot;Anjitsu&quot;.

<doc id="640835" wikidata="Q7086517" url="?curid=640835" title="Olfactory mucosa">
<text>The olfactory mucosa is the neuroepithelial mucosa lining the roof and upper parts of the septum and lateral wall of the nasal cavity which contains bipolar neurons of the primary receptor neurons of the olfactory pathway, as well as supporting cells. The neurons&#x27; dendrites project towards the nasal cavity while their axons ascend through the cribriform plate as the olfactory nerves.

The part of the nasal cavity that is lined with olfactory mucosa is known as the olfactory region (&quot;pars olfactoria tunicae mucosae nasi&quot;), while the rest of the nasal cavity that is lined by ordinary respiratory mucosa is known as the respiratory region.

== Structure ==
Olfactory mucosa lines about 5cm2 of the posterosuperior parts of the lateral nasal wall. Parts of the nasal cavity lined by olfactory mucosa include: parts of the roof of the nasal cavity, the superior nasal concha and some upper parts of the middle nasal concha, parts of the nasal septum, and the sphenoethmoidal recess.

The olfactory mucosa is thicker and lighter in colour (yellowish-brown) in comparison to the (pinkish) respiratory mucosa lining the rest of the nasal cavity.

Glands of the olfactory mucosa secrete a mostly serous fluid.

=== Histology ===
The olfactory mucosa consists of the olfactory epithelium and the underlying lamina propria, connective tissue containing fibroblasts, blood vessels, Bowman&#x27;s glands and bundles of fine axons from the olfactory neurons.

In vertebrates, the olfactory epithelium consists of a three basic cell types: bipolar olfactory receptor neurons; sustentacular cells, a type of supporting cell; and basal cells, the stem cells that continuously give rise to new olfactory receptor neurons and sustentacular cells.

Electron microscopy studies show that Bowman&#x27;s glands contain cells with large secretory vesicles. The exact composition of the secretions from Bowman&#x27;s glands is unclear, but there is evidence that they produce odorant binding protein.

== Physiology ==
The mucus protects the olfactory epithelium and allows odors to dissolve so that they can be detected by olfactory receptor neurons.

== Research ==
Adult stem cell harvesting

Cells in the olfactory mucosa have been used in clinical trials for adult stem cell therapeutic treatments and successfully harvested for future applications.

CB1 receptors and obesity

Type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1 receptors) are present in the sustentacular cells of the olfactory mucosa, in the periglomerular cells of the olfactory bulb, and in the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory cortices. A study in 2008 in mice has shown that the level of CB1 expression in various brain regions, including the olfactory nucleus, is modulated by diet-induced obesity.

<text>Port Richmond is a neighborhood situated on the North Shore of Staten Island, a borough of New York City. Port Richmond is bounded by Kill van Kull on the north, Clove Road on the east, Forest Avenue on the south, and the Bayonne Bridge on the west. It is adjacent to West New Brighton to the east, Westerleigh to the south, and Elm Park and Mariners Harbor to the west.

Formerly an independent village, it is one of the oldest neighborhoods on the island. In the 19th century it was an important transportation and industrial center of the island, but this role has vanished nearly completely, leaving a largely blue collar residential area bypassed by the shift of development of the island to its interior after the 1960s. The formerly bustling commercial center along Richmond Avenue (now Port Richmond Avenue) had been largely abandoned at the time, but many small businesses have opened in the area since the late 20th century.

Port Richmond is part of Staten Island Community District 1 and its ZIP Code is 10302. Port Richmond is patrolled by the 121st Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==History==

=== Early exploration and settlement ===

The first white European contact with Staten Island was recorded in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano. In 1609 Henry Hudson established Dutch trade in the area and named the island Staaten Eylandt after the Staten-Generaal, the Dutch parliament. However, it was not until the mid-17th century that a mixed Dutch and French settlement was established at New Dorp. Settlers established a cemetery at nearby Port Richmond, which served as the burial ground for residents of northern Staten Island until 1696. The community of Port Richmond grew up around this cemetery, beginning with the Dutch Reform Church that was built there in the early 18th century. This colonnaded Church, still standing on Port Richmond Avenue was built in 1824 after a fire destroyed the original building. From those Dutch roots, Port Richmond evolved into a thriving waterfront industrial and transportation hub. The village incorporated as Port Richmond in 1866, the same year as the Staten Island villages of New Brighton and Edgewater.
Port Richmond has had many names through the years. In the late 17th century it was known simply as The Burial Place. Subsequently, the area was alternately known as Bristol, New Bristol, Irvington, Cyrene, and Cityville. These names were proposed, but Port Richmond eventually won out in 1866. The name &quot;Port Richmond&quot; was given to the place by Rev. Dr. James Brownlee of the Dutch Reformed Church

In 1700 the area was known as the &quot;burial place&quot; from a cemetery of the Reformed Church on Staten Island near the present Port Richmond Avenue along the waterfront. It later became a transfer point between ferries from New York City to New Brunswick, New Jersey. A ferry landing (called variously &quot;Ryer&#x27;s Landing&quot;, &quot;Mercereau&#x27;s Landing&quot;, and &quot;Decker&#x27;s Landing&quot;) was later constructed for a route linking Staten Island across the Kill Van Kull to Bergen Point (present-day Bayonne, New Jersey). The Bayonne Bridge was constructed in 1931 yet ferry service continued until 1962.

===19th century===


Port Richmond&#x27;s location on the Kull Van Kill made it a prime ferry launch from Staten Island to New Jersey. It was a transfer port for freight and passengers traveling by boat between New York City and New Brunswick, New Jersey. This point is the part of Staten Island closest to Port Elizabeth, New Jersey and was once called Mersereau&#x27;s Point, after Mersereau&#x27;s Ferry. This point was also known as Lambert&#x27;s, Collyer&#x27;s, and Bowman&#x27;s Point. It was called Lambert&#x27;s Point during the Revolutionary War and later Collyer&#x27;s Point. Other ferries that operated from that point were: Dacosta&#x27;s, Indian, Decker&#x27;s, Ryers&#x27;, and Hilleker&#x27;s. Ryers&#x27; and Hilleker&#x27;s ferries were in competition with one another until David Mersereau bought out both companies in the late 19th century. Ferries ran continually until shortly after the Bayonne Bridge was built in 1931. The area also became the site of an important stop on a coach route between the city and Philadelphia. Port Richmond Avenue has been known over the years as Church Road, Port Richmond Plank Road, Stone Road, and Richmond Avenue. The road is a continuation of an old highway called the Morningstar Road.

Cornelius &quot;Commodore&quot; Vanderbilt, railway tycoon and patriarch of the Vanderbilt family, was born in the area in 1794. In 1836, former Vice President Aaron Burr died in Port Richmond at the St. James Hotel, a prominent hotel which once stood on Richmond Terrace until it was demolished.

In the early 19th century, the area was an overnight coach stop between New York City and Philadelphia. In 1836, a public park was built. In the middle 19th century, the area began to attract immigrants from Ireland and Germany. Among the industries established in the area was the only whale oil processing plant on Staten Island. It was later replaced by a linseed oil processing plant that operated until the 20th century. Other industries included lumber and coal yards, as a dye processing plant. Because oyster harvesting was a booming business along the mudflats in New York Harbor, many successful oyster boat captains built mansions on Richmond Terrace facing the Kill van Kull in the 1840s and 1850s. Industries along the waterfront included lumber and coal yards.

In 1883, Port Richmond was described as a model village:

In 1866, the neighborhood was incorporated as Port Richmond. In the 1880s, the Staten Island Railway constructed a North Shore branch with a stop in the village on Richmond Avenue, which had become a main shopping area of the island. In the 1870, St. Philip&#x27;s Baptist Church, the oldest of the three black Baptist congregations on the Island, was formed. The church still stands at 77 Bennett Street, next to the Port Richmond Library that was built with funds from Andrew Carnegie in 1902. At the beginning of the 20th century, the neighborhood attracted large numbers of Italian, Polish, Norwegian, and Swedish immigrants. Temple Emanu-El erected its domed, Classical building in 1907.

===20th century===
When telephone service was upgraded in New York City in December 1930, a telephone exchange bearing the designation &quot;Port Richmond 7&quot; was created, its territory including the neighborhood itself along with many other communities on the western and central North Shore plus the island&#x27;s then-sparsely populated, rural interior. This exchange was disconnected in 1948 when a &quot;Port Washington 7&quot; exchange was established to serve the town by that name in Nassau County, on Long Island; the Port Richmond exchange customers were moved to exchanges to the east, such as &quot;Saint George 7&quot;.

The neighborhood suffered a severe economic decline in the latter half of the 20th century, largely as a result of the shift of development and commercial activity to the center of the island, following the construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and Staten Island Mall. The North Shore Branch of the Staten Island Railway that ran through the neighborhood connecting it to St. George was mainly a freight railroad. It was owned by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and was briefly, in 1925 and 1926, used as a passenger service link to the ferry launch at St. George. This was suspended as the boat ride was slower than the usual B&amp;O trip to the CNJ Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey. During World War II some trains were used to move troops. This branch was closed in 1953, leaving behind a dilapidated track and Port Richmond station along Richmond (now Port Richmond) Avenue. Plans for reopening this line were studied at various times during the 1990s and early 2000s as a Staten Island light rail line.

==Demographics==

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Port Richmond was 20,191, a change of 2,149 (10.6%) from the 18,042 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 40.2% (8,115) White, 16.8% (3,392) African American, 0.3% (51) Native American, 3.9% (784) Asian, 0% (6) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (79) from other races, and 1.9% (377) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 36.6% (7,387) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 1, which comprises Port Richmond and other neighborhoods on the North Shore, had 181,484 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.0 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 24% are between the ages of between 0–17, 27% between 25 and 44, and 26% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 13% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 1 was $48,018, though the median income in Port Richmond individually was $51,135. In 2018, an estimated 21% of Port Richmond and the North Shore residents lived in poverty, compared to 17% in all of Staten Island and 20% in all of New York City. One in fourteen residents (7%) were unemployed, compared to 6% in Staten Island and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 51% in Port Richmond and the North Shore, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 49% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Port Richmond and the North Shore are considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

The Black and Latino populations are largest in the northern section of the neighborhood, near Richmond Terrace. The southeastern portion of the neighborhood (roughly south of Post Avenue &amp; east of Port Richmond Avenue) is the section with the largest percentage of Whites (almost 50%), and is sometimes referred to as &quot;Port Richmond Center&quot; or &quot;Upper Port Richmond&quot;. The 10302 zip code (which is mostly Port Richmond, but also includes part of Westerleigh) has the highest percentage of Hispanics of any zip code on Staten Island, at 41.3%. Within the Hispanic population, it is the only zip code on Staten Island where Mexicans outnumber Puerto Ricans: Mexicans make up 20% of the population of the zip code. The zip code includes parts of nearby Westerleigh, so Mexicans make up roughly 23% of the population of Port Richmond, with the presence being highest along Port Richmond Avenue, and in the northern part of the neighborhood in general.

===Racial tensions between blacks and Hispanics===
The African-American community that had long occupied Port Richmond&#x27;s Northern quarters began to see a large influx of Mexican immigrants move in alongside them starting late in the 1980s. The Mexicans transformed many boarded up storefronts along Port Richmond Avenue and quickly made the commercial strip the center of Latino culture on Staten Island. Still many of Port Richmond&#x27;s Mexicans line busy neighborhood streets every morning looking to be picked up for work as day laborers. Since they often commute on foot and usually have money in their pockets, the immigrants have long been targeted for violent muggings and senseless attacks on Port Richmond streets. The tensions between the area&#x27;s long-time inhabitants and its newcomers have been well documented for years. Several outreach groups have since popped up to address the community&#x27;s issues. Still, mistrust persists on both sides of the fence, as portions of northern Port Richmond (especially west of Port Richmond Avenue) have shifted from being predominantly Black to predominantly Hispanic.


This led to an incident, whence in the early morning hours of April 5, 2010, 26-year-old baker Rodulfo Olmedo was on his way home from a local club on Port Richmond Avenue when he was set upon by three African-American and one Hispanic teenagers, who badly beat Olmedo with unidentified objects believed to be baseball bats or wooden planks and possibly a chain before robbing his unconscious body of cash and a cellphone. After being helped by a passer-by and brought to the hospital, Olmedo, a 13-year resident of the U.S., told police that throughout the attack, which was captured on nearby surveillance cameras, he was verbally discriminated against. The attack provoked outrage both politically and locally, but while many felt the attack was solely a result of the victim&#x27;s nationality, the attackers insisted that they knew Olmedo and were merely settling an earlier score with him. Regardless, the incident caused similar but unpublicized incidents, which had been taking place, to be publicized. After the incident, the United States Department of Justice began assisting community officials in their efforts to develop a neighborhood watch or a &quot;Crime Response Team&quot;, a group of citizens that would possibly work with the NYPD to report suspicious activity and prevent more violence in the neighborhood, as well as to organize a series of meetings to facilitate community dialogue. They also set out to create &quot;safe spaces&quot;, which was not the first time the idea was floated. These are willing businesses that are open late, such as bodegas or delis, where people who feel like they are being followed or otherwise fear for their safety, can seek refuge and be assisted by workers with contacting the police.

===Wagner College&#x27;s Port Richmond Partnership Initiative===
In March 2008, local Wagner College chose Port Richmond as its target community to begin a five-year plan between the college and seven community groups with the intention of focusing all of Wagner&#x27;s volunteer activities squarely on the one community in hopes of improving the overall quality of life for the neighborhood&#x27;s residents by curbing several disturbing trends in the neighborhood ranging from poor health care access, youth obesity, racial/ethnic tensions and youth violence to limited economic and educational opportunities. The students would then be required to report on their progress as part of their course requirements with the ultimate goal being to make significant improvements in the aforementioned fields and eventually branching out to other distressed North Shore neighborhoods.

The Port Richmond initiative was lauded by former president Bill Clinton at The Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U) Meeting on February 14, 2009, at the University of Texas at Austin before a star-studded crowd. The CGI U is the college student/administrator-based offshoot of his Clinton Global Initiative, a non-partisan organization that convenes global leaders to devise and implement innovative solutions to the world&#x27;s most pressing problems.

==Police and crime==
Port Richmond and the West Shore are patrolled by the 121st Precinct of the NYPD, located at 970 Richmond Avenue. The 121st Precinct was split from the 120th Precinct in 2013; the latter ranked 12th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 94 per 100,000 people, Port Richmond and the North Shore&#x27;s rate of violent crimes per capita is more than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 719 per 100,000 people is higher than that of the city as a whole. The 121st Precinct saw one murder, 13 rapes, 86 robberies, 216 felony assaults, 90 burglaries, 397 grand larcenies, and 115 grand larcenies auto in 2022.

Port Richmond has long been plagued by high levels of crime, such as prostitution, drugs and violence. However, much of it takes place in the northern part of the neighborhood, north of roughly Post Avenue. In 2009, findings showed that Port Richmond (zip code 10302) received a 7 on a scale of 1–10 in terms of violent crime level - the highest for any zip code on Staten Island (one other Staten Island zip code also received a 7). The United States violent crime average for a zip code is a 3. Port Richmond also received a 6 on an identical scale measuring property crime. The United States property crime average for a zip code is also a 3.

Port Richmond High School, located in Port Richmond, had a new building constructed in 1993, but the school was originally opened in 1927. The school has about 2,700 students and is known as one of the highest performing high schools on Staten Island. The high school has a reputation for excellence in sports and academics. Newsweek has named Port Richmond High School in its list of &quot;Best High Schools&quot; in many recent years. The local middle school is Markham Intermediate School, located at 20 Houston Street in Westerleigh.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York operates Staten Island Catholic schools. St. Roch Parish School closed in 2011. In its final year it had 96 students, meaning the building was 35% utilized.

===Library===
The New York Public Library (NYPL)&#x27;s Port Richmond branch is located at 75 Bennett Street. Interest in a library began in 1833, and various private library groups operated during the 19th century. The Port Richmond branch&#x27;s current Carnegie library structure was built in 1905, becoming Port Richmond&#x27;s permanent library. The Chimes Playhouse auditorium was constructed in 1939, and the Children&#x27;s Room was rehabilitated in 2008.

The abandoned North Shore Branch of the Staten Island Railway runs through Port Richmond, and the area&#x27;s eponymous station still stands.

==Historical sites==

===Ritz Theater===
The Ritz Theater, a movie theater and vaudeville venue now a home improvement showroom, located at Port Richmond Avenue and Anderson Avenue, once hosted the biggest names in rock and roll and show business. It was built in 1924 by Sol Brill, who was also responsible for the construction of Staten Island&#x27;s Liberty, New Dorp, and St. George Theaters. The spacious Ritz Theater boasted 2,126 seats and was one of New York&#x27;s premier vaudeville houses. During the blizzard of 1947 the theater&#x27;s marquee was destroyed and was never restored. The theater also served as a prime American rock concert venue in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Since 1985, the theater has been owned and operated as a tile showroom by the Pedulla family. Portions of the theater&#x27;s original function can still be seen inside, and its famous murals still grace the walls.

===Old PS 20===
Now essentially a retirement community, it is one of the few remaining examples of 19th-century school buildings on Staten Island. Old PS 20 was the site of a school since 1842, when the two-story brick building and old stable served as classrooms for the students. The building that now stands on the site was built in 1891 after the old buildings were condemned for sanitary reasons. An addition to the 1891 construction was added in 1898 by James Warriner Moulton who attempted to give the addition what he termed greater &quot;strength&quot; and a &quot;more manly character.&quot; The architecture of the building draws from a variety of styles including Romanesque Revival, neo-Classical, Italian villa, and Americanized Queen Anne. The hodge-podge of styles suggests a vernacular approach and reflects the reality of the 19th century, when school districts were responsible for designing, constructing, and maintaining their own buildings. Old PS 20 was within the Staten Island school district until it was disbanded following the consolidation of New York City in 1898. The bell tower on Old PS 20 is significant because it reflects civic pride. It was the first school building to have such an impressive tower and is the last remaining example. Old PS 20 was designated a Landmark Site by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1988.

===121 Heberton Avenue===

This is a -story frame building, is located on the eastern side of Veteran&#x27;s Park, once the most fashionable locations in the neighborhood. Heberton Avenue is known for a plethora of handsome old houses. 121 Heberton, built by James G. Burger around 1859–61, is one of the most impressive. The residence is a rare surviving example in New York City of a picturesque villa in the Rustic style. The design combines elements seen in the pattern books of Gervase Wheeler, Calvert Vaux, and Samuel Sloan. Features associated with this style are broad gables, openwork brackets, long outside galleries, raised basement, and simple ornament. The house was first owned by a prosperous oysterman and abolitionist named Captain John J. Housman, then leased to tenants, and finally fell into the hands of the Brown family. The Browns had a number of notable family members in government in Richmond County. Though the house is no longer in the Brown family, it is still used as a residence today and recent renovations have preserved the unique historic quality of the house. The 121 Heberton Avenue House was designated a Landmark Site by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2002.

===Bodine Creek===
It is a short walk from The New York Public Library and Veteran&#x27;s Park. Bodine has had many names over the centuries, including Palmer&#x27;s Run and Mill Brook. Near Bodine Creek was Bodine&#x27;s Pond, used for years by various industries. The Richmond County Water Company once supplied water to the area, but when Bodine&#x27;s Pond was eventually drained, the wells of the company were sunk in the remaining marsh. The edges of the pond are still visible on the landscape in the form of Columbia Street and Jewett Avenue. In 1922, the New York Times reported that a 13-year-old boy was killed by a train while crabbing from the railway trestle over Bodine Creek. Other fatalities have been reported from drowning and train accidents.

===Port Richmond Hotel===
The Port Richmond Hotel, a barracks-like building facing the Bayonne ferry terminal, was once the elegant St. James Hotel. The St. James Hotel was erected in 1787 remained until 1945, when it was demolished. As identified by a plaque on the Griffith Block building, it was the last home of Aaron Burr, the third Vice President of the United States. He died there on September 14, 1836.

===Reformed Protestant Dutch Church and Burial Ground===

Built in 1845 in Greek revival style, this is the third church on the site. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 as the Reformed Church on Staten Island. The first, a hexagonal wooden building erected in 1714, was destroyed by the British during the revolution. The original building, a long structure around which the community now known as Port Richmond grew, was erected on land donated in 1714 by Governor Hunter. The original license to the Dutch Congregation signed by Governor Hunter in 1714 is preserved. The grounds also serve in commemoration of the Five Brothers from Staten Island who served in the Revolutionary War. The Daughters of the American Revolution recognized the Brothers Mersereau: Joshua - 3rd Quarter Master General, Jacob - Colonel, Cornelius - Soldier, John - Captain, and Paul - Sailor.

==In media==
The cult classic movie release &quot;Combat Shock&quot;, the independent directing debut of Staten Island native Buddy Giovinazzo, is set in and was largely filmed in Port Richmond, where the main character dwells in apocalyptic squalor. The movie has been hailed for its raw depiction of inner city life and use of the gritty streetscapes it was filmed amid.

In December 2009, Arcadia Publishing released a book named &quot;Port Richmond&quot; on its &quot;Images of America&quot; product line about the neighborhood&#x27;s history, including its ethnic diversity and the effect various immigrant groups have had on the community. The book was written by Phillip Papas and Lori R. Weintrob.

<doc id="640837" wikidata="Q1586150" url="?curid=640837" title="Harriet Monroe">
<text>Harriet Monroe (December 23, 1860 – September 26, 1936) was an American editor, scholar, literary critic, poet, and patron of the arts. She was the founding publisher and long-time editor of &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine, which she established in 1912. As a supporter of the poets Wallace Stevens, Ezra Pound, H. D., T. S. Eliot, William Carlos Williams, Carl Sandburg, Max Michelson and others, Monroe played an important role in the development of modern poetry. Her correspondence with early twentieth century poets provides a wealth of information on their thoughts and motives.

==Early life and education==

Monroe was born in Chicago, Illinois. She read at an early age; her father, a lawyer, had a large library that provided refuge from domestic discord. In her autobiography, &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Life: Seventy Years in a Changing World&quot;, published two years after her death, Monroe recalls: &quot;I started in early with Shakespeare, Byron, Shelley, with Dickens and Thackeray; and always the book-lined library gave me a friendly assurance of companionship with lively and interesting people, gave me friends of the spirit to ease my loneliness.&quot;

==Career==

=== Early writing ===
In 1879, Monroe graduated from the Visitation Academy located in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C. Her mentor in writing was Mary Paulina Finn, a nun and writer. Sr. Finn published books, plays, and poems as M.S. Pine. Monroe was later recognized as a talented author for her age. Her prose published in 1899 in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, The &quot;Grand Canyon of the Colorado&quot;, was considered better poetry than her most notable poem, &quot;I love my life&quot;.

Driven by fears of posthumous anonymity, Monroe proclaimed after graduation her determination to become &quot;great and famous&quot; as a poet or playwright. In the &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot;, Judith Paterson quoted her as saying, &quot;I cannot remember when to die without leaving some memorable record did not seem to me a calamity too terrible to be borne.&quot; She afterward devoted herself to literary work. In her biography, Monroe wrote, &#x27;I have sense of consecration that made me think I would prefer art to life&#x27;.

Though &quot;Century&quot; magazine published her poem, &quot;With a Copy of Shelley&quot;, in 1889, she became disillusioned by the limited earnings available for poets, saying: &quot;The minor painter or sculptor was honored with large annual awards in our greatest cities, while the minor poet was a joke of the paragraphers, subject to the popular prejudice that his art thrived best on starvation in a garret.&quot; She became a freelance correspondent to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and was commissioned to write a commemorative ode to be read at the opening ceremonies for the World&#x27;s Fair commemorating the 400th anniversary of Columbus&#x27; first landing in the Americas.,

=== &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine ===
Monroe&#x27;s financial hardships were alleviated after she sued the &quot;New York World&quot; for publishing the Colombian ode poem without her consent and she was awarded $5,000 in a settlement.
With help from publisher Hobart Chatfield-Taylor, Monroe convinced one hundred prominent Chicago business leaders to sponsor the magazine &quot;Poetry&quot; by each committing to fifty dollars for a five-year subscription. The $5,000, coupled with her own settlement, was enough to launch the magazine on September 23, 1912, while upholding its promise to contributors of adequate payment for all published work.

Monroe was editor for its first two years without salary, while simultaneously working as an art critic for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. By 1914, the magazine work became too much for her to accomplish while working other jobs, so she resigned from the &quot;Tribune&quot; and accepted a salary of fifty dollars per month from the magazine. For more than ten years she maintained herself on this stipend, raising it to one hundred dollars per month in 1925. Her extensive papers and correspondence as editor of &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine, illuminate the authorial process and the birth of modern poetry.

Don Share, who became editor of &quot;Poetry&quot; in 2013, writes that Monroe seemed to have a &quot;sixth sense&quot; about the poetry she published. Monroe, herself, wrote and preferred poems rooted in 19th century tradition, but in her magazine, &quot;that countervailing sixth sense allowed her to make literary history. She invented a box, you could say — and promptly set to work thinking outside it. Her magazine was, therefore, like she was: unpredictable, difficult, and infuriating,&quot; but she never wavered in her assessment of progressive American culture as a democratic triumph.

== Later life and death ==
Monroe continued to edit &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine until she died in Arequipa, Peru on September 26, 1936, at age 75. She was on her way to climb Machu Picchu, and the high altitudes reportedly triggered a cerebral hemorrhage, which caused her death.

Monroe was a member of the Eagle&#x27;s Nest Art Colony in Ogle County, Illinois, and is mentioned in Erik Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Devil in the White City&quot;. In 2011, Monroe was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.

==Family==
Monroe was the sister-in-law of Chicago architect John Wellborn Root, and wrote his biography.

<doc id="640839" wikidata="Q1047529" url="?curid=640839" title="Kintarō">
<text>is a folk hero from Japanese folklore. A child of superhuman strength, he was raised by a yama-uba (&quot;mountain witch&quot;) on Mount Ashigara. He became friendly with the animals of the mountain, and later, after catching Shuten-dōji, the terror of the region around Mount Ōe, he became a loyal follower of Minamoto no Yorimitsu under the new name . He is a popular figure in Bunraku and kabuki drama, and it is a custom to put up a Kintarō doll on Boy&#x27;s Day in the hope that boys will become equally brave and strong.

Kintarō is supposedly based on a real person, Sakata Kintoki, who lived during the Heian period and probably came from what is now the city of Minamiashigara, Kanagawa. He served as a retainer for the samurai Minamoto no Yorimitsu and became well known for his abilities as a warrior. As with many larger-than-life individuals, his legend has grown with time.

==Legend==
Several competing stories tell of Kintarō&#x27;s childhood. In one, he was raised by his mother, Princess Yaegiri, daughter of a wealthy man named Shiman-chōja, in the village of Jizodo, near Mount Ashigara. In a competing legend, his mother gave birth to him in what is now Sakata, Yamagata. She was forced to flee, however, due to fighting between her husband, a samurai named Sakata, and his uncle. She finally settled in the forests of Mount Ashigara to raise her son. Alternatively, Kintarō&#x27;s real mother left the child in the wilds or died and left him an orphan, and he was raised by a yama-uba or &quot;mountain witch&quot; (one tale says Kintarō&#x27;s mother raised him in the wilds, but due to her haggard appearance, she came to be &quot;called&quot; yama-uba). In the most fanciful version of the tale, the yama-uba was Kintarō&#x27;s mother, impregnated by a clap of thunder sent from a red dragon of Mount Ashigara. According to some sources, the dragon was Raijin or possibly raiju, Raijin&#x27;s animal companion which is oftentimes a dragon.

The legends agree that even as a toddler, Kintarō was active and tireless, plump and ruddy, wearing only a &quot;haragake&quot; apron with the kanji for &quot;gold&quot; (金) on it. His only other belonging was a hatchet (&quot;ono&quot; or &quot;masakari&quot;). He was bossy to other children (or there simply were no other children in the forest), so his friends were mainly the animals of Mt. Kintoki and Mt. Ashigara. He was also phenomenally strong, able to smash rocks into pieces, uproot trees, and bend trunks like twigs. His animal friends served him as messengers and mounts, and some legends say that he even learned to speak their language. Several tales tell of Kintarō&#x27;s adventures, fighting monsters and oni (demons), beating bears in sumo wrestling, and helping the local woodcutters fell trees.

As an adult, Kintarō changed his name to Sakata no Kintoki. He met the samurai Minamoto no Yorimitsu as he passed through the area around Mt. Kintoki. Yorimitsu was impressed by Kintarō&#x27;s enormous strength, so he took him as one of his personal retainers to live with him in Kyoto. Kintoki studied martial arts there and eventually became the chief of Yorimitsu&#x27;s Shitennō (&quot;four braves&quot;), renowned for his strength and martial prowess. He eventually went back for his mother and brought her to Kyoto as well.
==In modern Japan==
Kintarō is an extremely popular figure in Japan, and his image adorns everything from statues to storybooks, anime, manga to action figures. For example, the manga and anime &quot;Golden Boy&quot; stars a character with the same name. Kintarō as an image is characterized with an ono, a &quot;haragake&quot; apron, and sometimes a tame bear. In many of Kintarō&#x27;s pictures, it seems that he is trying to capture a giant black koi. This seems to glorify his strength as he is able to wrestle with such a creature.

Kintarō candy has been around since the Edo period; no matter how the cylinder-shaped candy is cut, Kintarō&#x27;s face appears inside. Japanese tradition is to decorate the room of a newborn baby boy with Kintarō dolls on Children&#x27;s Day (May 5) so that the child will grow up to be strong like the Golden Boy. A shrine dedicated to the folk hero lies at the foot of Mount Ashigara in the Hakone area near Tokyo. Nearby is a giant boulder that was supposedly chopped in half by the boy hero himself.


The name and certain traits of the main character of &quot;Gin Tama&quot;, Gintoki Sakata, are loosely based on Kintarō. The relation has also been confirmed in Gin Tama&#x27;s episode 98 and manga volume 10. Gintoki has its name contain the character for &quot;silver&quot; instead of &quot;gold&quot;, and he has silver hair. One of his nemeses, the golden-haired Sakata Kintoki, also made an appearance.

<doc id="640841" wikidata="Q126214" url="?curid=640841" title="Refusenik">
<text>Refusenik (, ; alternatively spelled refusnik) was an unofficial term for individuals—typically, but not exclusively, Soviet Jews—who were denied permission to emigrate, primarily to Israel, by the authorities of the Soviet Union and other countries of the Soviet Bloc. The term &quot;refusenik&quot; is derived from the &quot;refusal&quot; handed down to a prospective emigrant from the Soviet authorities.

In addition to the Jews, broader categories included:
*Other ethnicities, such as Volga Germans attempting to leave for Germany, Armenians wanting to join their diaspora, and Greeks forcibly removed by Stalin from Crimea and other southern lands to Siberia.
*Members of persecuted religious groups, such as the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Baptists and other Protestant groups, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and Russian Mennonites.

A typical basis to deny emigration was the alleged association with Soviet state secrets. Some individuals were labelled as foreign spies or potential seditionists who purportedly wanted to abuse Israeli &quot;aliyah&quot; and Law of Return (right to return) as a means of escaping punishment for high treason or sedition from abroad.

Applying for an exit visa was a step noted by the KGB, so that future career prospects, always uncertain for Soviet Jews, could be impaired. As a rule, Soviet dissidents and refuseniks were fired from their workplaces and denied employment according to their major specialty. As a result, they had to find a menial job, such as a street sweeper, or face imprisonment on charges of social parasitism.

The ban on Jewish immigration to Israel was lifted in 1971, leading to the 1970s Soviet Union aliyah. The coming to power of Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, and his policies of glasnost and perestroika, as well as a desire for better relations with the West, led to major changes, and most refuseniks were allowed to emigrate.

== History of the Jewish refuseniks ==
A large number of Soviet Jews applied for exit visas to leave the Soviet Union, especially in the period following the 1967 Six-Day War. While some were allowed to leave, many were refused permission to emigrate, either immediately or after their cases would languish for years in the OVIR () or Office of Visas and Registration, the MVD (Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs) department responsible for exit visas. In many instances, the reason given for denial was that these persons had been given access, at some point in their careers, to information vital to Soviet national security and could not now be allowed to leave.

During the Cold War, Soviet Jews were thought to be a security liability or possible traitors. To apply for an exit visa, the applicants (and often their entire families) would have to quit their jobs, which in turn would make them vulnerable to charges of social parasitism, a criminal offense.

Many Jews encountered systematic, institutional antisemitism which blocked their opportunities for advancement. Some government sectors were almost entirely off-limits to Jews. In addition, Soviet restrictions on religious education and expression prevented Jews from engaging in Jewish cultural and religious life. While these restrictions led many Jews to seek emigration, requesting an exit visa was itself seen as an act of betrayal by Soviet authorities. Thus, prospective emigrants requested permission to emigrate at great personal risk, knowing that an official refusal would often be accompanied by dismissal from work and other forms of social ostracism and economic pressure. 
At the same time, strong international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to significantly increase the emigration quota. In the years 1960 through 1970, only 4,000 people (legally) emigrated from the USSR. In the following decade, the number rose to 250,000, to fall again by 1980.

=== Hijacking incident ===
In 1970, a group of 16 refuseniks (two of whom were not Jewish), organized by dissident Eduard Kuznetsov (who already served a seven-year term in Soviet prisons), plotted to buy all the seats for the local flight Leningrad-Priozersk, under the guise of a trip to a wedding, on a small 12-seater aircraft Antonov An-2 (colloquially known as ), throw out the pilots before takeoff from an intermediate stop, and fly it to Sweden, knowing they faced a huge risk of being captured or shot down. One of the participants, Mark Dymshits, was a former military pilot.

On 15 June 1970, after arriving at Smolnoye (later Rzhevka) Airport near Leningrad, the entire group of the &quot;wedding guests&quot; was arrested by the MVD.

The accused were charged with high treason, punishable by the death sentence under Article 64 of the Penal code of the RSFSR. Dymshits and Kuznetsov were sentenced to capital punishment, but after international protests, it was appealed and replaced with 15 years in prison; Yosef Mendelevitch and Yuri Fedorov: 15 years; Aleksey Murzhenko: 14 years; Sylva Zalmanson (Kuznetsov&#x27;s wife and the only woman on trial): 10 years; Arie (Leib) Knokh: 13 years; Anatoli Altmann: 12 years; Boris Penson: 10 years; Israel Zalmanson: 8 years; Wolf Zalmanson (brother of Sylva and Israel): 10 years; Mendel Bodnya: 4 years.

=== Crackdown on the refusenik activism and its growth ===

The affair was followed by a crackdown on the Jewish and dissident movement throughout the USSR. Activists were arrested, makeshift centers for studying the Hebrew language and Torah were closed, and more trials followed. At the same time, strong international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to significantly increase the emigration quota. In the years 1960 through 1970, only about 3,000 Soviet Jews had (legally) emigrated from the USSR; after the trial, in the period from 1971 to 1980 347,100 people received a visa to leave the USSR, 245,951 of them were Jews.

A leading proponent and spokesman for the refusenik rights during the mid-1970s was Natan Sharansky. Sharansky&#x27;s involvement with the Moscow Helsinki Group helped to establish the struggle for emigration rights within the greater context of the human rights movement in the USSR. His arrest on charges of espionage and treason and subsequent trial contributed to international support for the refusenik cause.

=== International pressure ===
On 18 October 1976, 13 Jewish refuseniks came to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to petition for explanations of denials of their right to emigrate from the USSR, as affirmed under the Helsinki Final Act. Failing to receive any answer, they assembled in the reception room of the Presidium on the following day. After a few hours of waiting, they were seized by the police, taken outside of the city limits and beaten. Two of them were kept in police custody.

In the next week, following an unsuccessful meeting between the activists&#x27; leaders and the Soviet Minister of Internal Affairs, General Nikolay Shchelokov, these abuses of law inspired several demonstrations in the Soviet capital. On Monday, 25 October 1976, 22 activists, including Mark Azbel, Felix Kandel, Alexander Lerner, Ida Nudel, Anatoly Shcharansky, Vladimir Slepak, and Michael Zeleny, were arrested in Moscow on their way to the next demonstration. They were convicted of hooliganism and incarcerated in the detention center Beryozka and other penitentiaries in and around Moscow. An unrelated party, artist Victor Motko, arrested in Dzerzhinsky Square, was detained along with the protesters in recognition of his prior attempts to emigrate from the USSR. These events were covered by several British and American journalists including David K. Shipler, Craig R. Whitney, and Christopher S. Wren. The October demonstrations and arrests coincided with the end of the 1976 United States presidential election. On October 25, U.S. presidential candidate Jimmy Carter expressed his support of the protesters in a telegram sent to Scharansky, and urged the Soviet authorities to release them. (See Léopold Unger, Christian Jelen, &quot;Le grand retour&quot;, A. Michel 1977; Феликс Кандель, &quot;Зона отдыха, или Пятнадцать суток на размышление&quot;, Типография Ольшанский Лтд, Иерусалим, 1979; Феликс Кандель, &quot;Врата исхода нашего: Девять страниц истории&quot;, Effect Publications, Tel-Aviv, 1980.) On 9 November 1976, a week after Carter won the presidential election, the Soviet authorities released all but two of the previously arrested protesters. Several more were subsequently rearrested and incarcerated or exiled to Siberia.

On 1 June 1978, &quot;refuseniks&quot; Vladimir and Maria Slepak stood on the eighth story balcony of their apartment building. By then they had been denied permission to emigrate for over 8 years. Vladimir displayed a banner that read &quot;Let us go to our son in Israel&quot;. His wife Maria held a banner that read &quot;Visa for my son&quot;. Fellow &quot;refusenik&quot; and Helsinki activist Ida Nudel held a similar display on the balcony of her own apartment. They were all arrested and charged with malicious hooliganism in violation of Article 206.2 of the Penal Code of the Soviet Union. The Moscow Helsinki Group protested their arrests in circulars dated 5 and 15 June of that year. Vladimir Slepak and Ida Nudel were convicted of all charges. They served 5 and 4 years in Siberian exile.

Various activist organizations constituted the Soviet Jewry Movement. Human rights organizations included the Cleveland Council on Soviet Anti-Semitism (1963), Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry (1964), Bay Area Council for Soviet Jews (1967), the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews (1970), and the National Coalition Supporting Soviet Jewry (1971).

Another major source of pressure in favor of the rights of refuseniks was the Jackson–Vanik amendment to the 1974 Trade Act. Jackson–Vanik affected U.S. trade relations with countries with non-market economies (originally, countries of the Communist bloc) that restricted freedom of Jewish emigration and other human rights. As such, it was applied to the USSR. According to Mark E. Talisman, those who benefited included Jewish refuseniks from the Soviet Union, as well as Hungarians, Romanians, and other citizens that sought to emigrate from their nations.

== Refusenik as a word ==

Although &#x27;refusenik&#x27; originally had a precise meaning those denied exit from the Soviet Union its meaning has sometimes diverged away from this sense. It began to be used to mean &quot;outsider&quot; for groups other than Russian Jews and later to mean &quot;those who refuse&quot; rather than its original sense of &quot;those who are refused&quot;. Over time, &quot;refusenik&quot; has entered colloquial English for a person who refuses to do something, especially by way of protest.

In 1992, Mikhail Gorbachev referred to himself as the first political &quot;refusenik of Russia&quot;, after buildings of the Gorbachev Foundation were taken by the Russian government and the country&#x27;s high court requested that Gorbachev would be forbidden from leaving the country.

It is occasionally used in the UK to mean &quot;ones who refuse to comply&quot;, and in the U.S., with many people who use it being unaware of the word&#x27;s origins. However, the original meaning is preserved and used in parallel, particularly in Israeli and Jewish articles about the historical events from which it emerged.

== Documentary films ==
* In 2008 filmmaker Laura Bialis released a documentary film, &quot;Refusenik&quot;, chronicling the human rights struggle of the Soviet refuseniks.

<doc id="640843" wikidata="Q1628706" url="?curid=640843" title="The Pall Mall Gazette">
<text>The Pall Mall Gazette was an evening newspaper founded in London on 7 February 1865 by George Murray Smith; its first editor was Frederick Greenwood. In 1921, &quot;The Globe&quot; merged into &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, which itself was absorbed into &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; in 1923.

Beginning late in 1868 and continuing at least through the 1880s, a selection or digest of its contents was published as the weekly &quot;Pall Mall Budget&quot;.

==History==
&quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; took the name of a fictional newspaper conceived by W. M. Thackeray. Pall Mall is a street in London where many gentlemen&#x27;s clubs are located, hence Thackeray&#x27;s description of this imaginary newspaper in his novel &quot;The History of Pendennis&quot; (1848–1850):

We address ourselves to the higher circles of society: we care not to disown it—&quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; is written by gentlemen for gentlemen; its conductors speak to the classes in which they live and were born. The field-preacher has his journal, the radical free-thinker has his journal: why should the Gentlemen of England be unrepresented in the Press?

Under the ownership of George Smith of Smith, Elder &amp; Co. from 1865 to 1880, with Frederick Greenwood as editor, &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; was a Conservative newspaper. Greenwood resigned in 1880, when the paper&#x27;s new owner (Smith&#x27;s new son-in-law, Henry Thompson) wished for it to support the policies of the Liberal Party. Taking all the staff with him, Greenwood became the editor of the newly-founded &quot;St James&#x27;s Gazette&quot; and maintained his advocacy of Conservative policy. The first editor under Thompson&#x27;s ownership was John Morley (later Viscount Morley), with W. T. Stead as assistant editor. Morley resigned in 1883 to go into politics.

Stead&#x27;s editorship from 1883 to 1889 saw the paper cover such subjects as child prostitution; his campaign compelled the government to increase the age of consent from 13 to 16 in 1885. This was one of the first examples of investigative journalism, and Stead was arrested for &quot;unlawful taking of a child&quot; (when he purchased thirteen-year-old Eliza Armstrong from her mother for the meagre price of £5, to highlight how easy it was to buy children). The affair distressed Thompson, who dismissed Stead and hired the handsome society figure Henry Cust to replace him. Editor from 1892 to 1896, Cust returned the paper to its Conservative beginnings.

Thompson sold the paper to William Waldorf Astor in 1896. Sir Douglas Straight was editor until 1909, followed by F. J. Higginbottom, under whom the paper declined. Circulation doubled between 1911–15 under the editor James Louis Garvin, but the paper declined once more under its last editor D. L. Sutherland. It was absorbed into The Evening Standard in 1923.
Several well-known writers contributed to &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; over the years. George Bernard Shaw gained his first job in journalism writing for the paper. Other contributors have included Anthony Trollope, Friedrich Engels, Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, Charles Whibley, Sir Spencer Walpole, Arthur Patchett Martin, and Jamaican-born writer Eneas Sweetland Dallas.

&quot;The British Weekly&quot;, &quot;one of the most successful religious newspapers of its time&quot;, followed stylistically in the footsteps of the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, &quot;including interviews of prominent personalities, use of line illustrations and photographs, special supplements, investigative reporting, sensationalist headlines, and serialised debates&quot;.

==References in popular culture==
Many works of fiction refer to &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;. For example:
* Consulting detective Sherlock Holmes places an advertisement in newspapers including &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, in &quot;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&quot; (1892).
* In Bram Stoker&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897), the reader is presented with a &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; article describing the escape of a wolf from the Zoological Gardens.
* In H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895), the Time Traveller returns to London and sees that day&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;. From its date he knows that he is home at his starting point in time.
* In Wells&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1898), the narrator describes the &quot;pre-Martian periodical called &quot;Punch&quot;&quot; as a prophecy.
* In director Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s first feature film &quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979), H. G. Wells (played by Malcolm McDowell) is a time traveler himself, 90 years in his future chasing Jack the Ripper (by David Warner) through the city of San Francisco in the year 1979. In a revolving restaurant, new female friend Amy (by Mary Steenburgen) states that Wells strikes her as the type that &quot;never reads a newspaper&quot;. Wells replies, &quot;I used to write for a newspaper, &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;&quot;. 
*In the Peruvian novel &quot;Vienen los Chilenos&quot; (&quot;The Chileans are Coming&quot;) by Guillermo Thorndike (1978), Mr. Petrie, an English gentleman travelling to Lima during the 19th-century Saltpeter War, visits its Phoenix Club, where Englishmen and England-educated Peruvians meet and converse in English. In its library he selects &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, and some American newspapers, and reads news of the attempted assassination of the Tsar, the famine in Ireland, the fighting between British and Afghan troops, and the cavalry attacks on the Sioux in the United States.
*In Gabrielle D&#x27;annunzio&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pleasure&quot; &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; is referred as the scandalous English newspaper.

<text>In Japanese mythology, the is a legendary creature associated with lightning and thunder, as well as the god Raijin.

==Mythology==
A &quot;raijū&quot;&#x27;s body is composed of (or wrapped in) lightning and commonly conceived of as taking the form of a white-blue wolf or dog, among other such animal forms as a tanuki, rabbit, porcupine, bear, squirrel, rat, mouse, deer, boar, leopard, fox, weasel, black or white panther, serow, ferret, marten, marine mammal (such as whale, dolphin or seal), tiger, and cat. It may also fly about as a ball of lightning (in fact, the creature may be an attempt to explain the phenomenon of lightning, such as ball lightning). Its cry sounds like thunder.

&quot;Raijū&quot; is the companion of Raijin, the Shinto god of lightning. While the beast is generally calm and harmless, during thunderstorms it becomes agitated, and leaps about in trees, fields, and even buildings (trees that have been struck by lightning are said to have been scratched by &quot;raijū&quot;&#x27;s claws).

Another of &quot;raijū&quot;&#x27;s peculiar behaviors is sleeping in human navels. This prompts the Raijin to shoot lightning arrows at &quot;raijū&quot; to wake the creature up, and thus harms the person in whose belly the demon is resting. Superstitious people therefore often sleep on their stomachs during bad weather, but other legends say that &quot;raijū&quot; will only hide in the navels of people who sleep outdoors.

== Origin ==
It is believed that the myth of &quot;raijū&quot; originated from the Chinese materia medica text &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot;. Scholars believe that there were &quot;raijū&quot; sightings and documentation during the Edo period in the history of Japan. However, it is also believed that because the sky was an unexplored territory and Western scientific and technological knowledge had not yet reached Japan, the mysterious phenomenon of thunder and lightning were attributed to the notoriety of &quot;raijū&quot;.

&quot;Raijū&quot; are given negative connotations as many things were happening in the sky beyond the reach of humans during the Edo period. While the depths of oceans were also inaccessible to human reason, oceans were helping humans with fishes (food) and sustained life forms. In this sense, phenomena of the sky were transcendental and given negative connotations to the phenomena and the creature.

== Scientific attempts ==
Dead animals were found from under trees after a stormy night in Japan. Attempts were made to debunk this myth. It was claimed that dead &quot;raijū&quot; are essentially real dead animals startled or knocked off from the tree during tempestuous weather of Japan. Recent theories suggest that &quot;raijū&quot; are essentially a small tree-dwelling creature known as the masked palm civet (&quot;Paguma larvata&quot;), which is actually native to certain countries in southern, eastern and southeastern Asia. While some scholars believe that the masked palm civet was brought to Japan by World War II soldiers as pets, the bearish resemblance of &quot;raijū&quot; in paintings from the Edo period to this civet also suggests that it has been around in Japan since much earlier.

<text>Kan Bahlam I (), also known as Chan Bahlum I, (September 18, 524 – February 1, 583) was an ajaw of the Maya city-state of Palenque. He acceded to the throne on April 6, 572 at age 47 and ruled until his death. Kan Bahlam was most likely the younger brother of his predecessor, Ahkal Moʼ Nahb II and probably son of Kʼan Joy Chitam I. He was the first ruler of Palenque to use the title &quot;Kʼinich&quot;, albeit inconsistently. The title is usually translated as &quot;radiant&quot; but literally means &quot;sun-faced&quot;.

<doc id="640846" wikidata="Q2520805" url="?curid=640846" title="Coefficient of relationship">
<text>The coefficient of relationship is a measure of the degree of consanguinity (or biological relationship) between two individuals. The term coefficient of relationship was defined by Sewall Wright in 1922, and was derived from his definition of the coefficient of inbreeding of 1921. The measure is most commonly used in genetics and genealogy. A coefficient of inbreeding can be calculated for an individual, and is typically one-half the coefficient of relationship between the parents.

In general, the higher the level of inbreeding the closer the coefficient of relationship between the parents approaches a value of 1, expressed as a percentage, and approaches a value of 0 for individuals with arbitrarily remote common ancestors.

==Coefficient of relationship==

The coefficient of relationship (formula_1) between two people B and C is obtained by a summation of coefficients calculated for every line by which they are connected to their common ancestors. Each such line connects the two people via a common ancestor, passing through no person which is not a common ancestor more than once. A path coefficient between an ancestor A and an offspring O separated by formula_2 generations is given as:
:formula_3

where formula_4 and formula_5 are the coefficients of inbreeding for A and O, respectively.

The coefficient of relationship formula_6 is now obtained by summing over all path coefficients:
:formula_7

By assuming that the pedigree can be traced back to a sufficiently remote population of perfectly random-bred stock (&quot;f&quot;A = 0 for all &quot;A&quot; in the sum) the definition of &quot;r&quot; may be simplified to 
:formula_8

where &quot;p&quot; enumerates all paths connecting B and C with unique common ancestors (i.e. all paths terminate at a common ancestor and may not pass through a common ancestor to a common ancestor&#x27;s ancestor), and &quot;L(p)&quot; is the length of the path &quot;p&quot;.

To give an (artificial) example: 
Assuming that two people share the same 32 ancestors of &quot;n&quot; = 5 generations ago, but do not have any common ancestors at four or fewer generations ago, their coefficient of relationship would be 
:formula_9, which for n = 5, is, formula_10, equal to 0.03125 or approximately 3%.

People for which the same situation applies for their 1024 ancestors of ten generations ago would have a coefficient of &quot;r&quot; = 2−10 = 0.1%.
If follows that the value of &quot;r&quot; can be given to an accuracy of a few percent if the family tree of both people is known for a depth of five generations, and to an accuracy of a tenth of a percent if the known depth is at least ten generations. The contribution to &quot;r&quot; from common ancestors of 20 generations ago (corresponding to roughly 500 years in human genealogy, or the contribution from common descent from a medieval population) falls below one part-per-million.

==Human relationships==

The coefficient of relationship is sometimes used to express degrees of kinship in numeric terms in human genealogy.

In human relationships, the value of the coefficient of relationship is usually calculated based on the knowledge of a full family tree extending to a comparatively small number of generations, perhaps of the order of three or four. As explained above, the value for the coefficient of relationship so calculated is thus a lower bound, with an actual value that may be up to a few percent higher. The value is accurate to within 1% if the full family tree of both individuals is known to a depth of seven generations.

A first-degree relative (FDR) is a person&#x27;s parent (father or mother), sibling (brother or sister) or child (son or daughter). It constitutes a category of family members that largely overlaps with the term nuclear family, but without spouses. If the persons are related by blood, the first degree relatives share approximately 50% of their genes. First-degree relatives are a common measure used to diagnose risks for common diseases by analyzing family history.

A second-degree relative (SDR) is someone who shares 25% of a person&#x27;s genes. It includes uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, grandparents, grandchildren, half-siblings and double-first cousins.

Third-degree relatives are a segment of the extended family and includes first cousins, great-grandparents and great-grandchildren. Third-degree relatives are generally defined by the expected amount of genetic overlap that exists between two people, with the third-degree relatives of an individual sharing approximately 12.5% of their genes. The category includes great-grandparents, great-grandchildren, granduncles, grandaunts, grandnephews, grandnieces, first cousins, half-uncles, half-aunts, half-nieces and half-nephews.

Most incest laws concern the relationships where &quot;r&quot; = 25% or higher, although many ignore the rare case of double first cousins. Some jurisdictions also prohibit sexual relations or marriage between cousins of various degree, or individuals related only through adoption or affinity. Whether there is any likelihood of conception is generally considered irrelevant.

==Kinship coefficient==

The kinship coefficient is a simple measure of relatedness, defined as the probability that a pair of randomly sampled homologous alleles are identical by descent. More simply, it is the probability that an allele selected randomly from an individual, i, and an allele selected at the same autosomal locus from another individual, j, are identical and from the same ancestor.
The coefficient of relatedness is equal to twice the kinship coefficient.

===Calculation===
The kinship coefficient between two individuals, i and j, is represented as Φij. The kinship coefficient between a non-inbred individual and itself, Φii, is equal to 1/2. This is due to the fact that humans are diploid, meaning the only way for the randomly chosen alleles to be identical by descent is if the same allele is chosen twice (probability 1/2). Similarly, the relationship between a parent and a child is found by the chance that the randomly picked allele in the child is from the parent (probability 1/2) and the probability of the allele that is picked from the parent being the same one passed to the child (probability 1/2). Since these two events are independent of each other, they are multiplied Φij = 1/2 X 1/2 = 1/4.

<text>, which may include , , and the specifically female version, the , are a divine kind of spiritual beings found in Japanese Buddhism, the equivalent of angels. They were seemingly imported from Chinese Buddhism, which was itself influenced by the concepts of heavenly beings found in Indian Buddhism and Chinese Taoism.

They originated in Hinduism as &quot;Apsara&quot; (Sanskrit: अप्सरा, romanized: apsaras or apsarā); a member of a class of celestial beings in Hindu and Buddhist culture. They are originally a type of female spirit of the clouds and waters, who later plays the role of a &quot;nymph&quot; or &quot;fairy&quot;. They figure prominently in the sculpture, dance, literature and painting of many Indian and Southeast Asian cultures. See also &quot;Devi&quot;, Deva (Hinduism) (a divine being or god in Hinduism), Deva (Buddhism) (a higher being in Buddhism) and Deva (Jainism) (a term used for heavenly beings in Jainism). 

In China, &quot;Apsara&quot; are known as &quot;Tiānshǐ&quot; (天使) and &quot;Tiānrén&quot; (天人); &quot;Tiānnǚ&quot; (天女) for &quot;female Tennin&quot; and &quot;Tennan&quot; (天男) for &quot;male Tiānnán&quot;.

In Japan, &quot;Apsara&quot; are known as &quot;Tenshi&quot; (天使) and &quot;Tennin&quot; (天人); &quot;Tennyo&quot; (天女) for &quot;female Tennin&quot; and &quot;Tennan&quot; (天男) for &quot;male Tennin&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Tennin&quot; are mentioned in Buddhist sutras, and these descriptions form the basis for depictions of the beings in Japanese art, sculpture, and theater. They are usually pictured as unnaturally beautiful women dressed in ornate, colourful kimono (traditionally in five colours), exquisite jewelry, and stole-like, feathered, flowing scarves--called both &quot;Chányī&quot;/&quot;Tenne&quot; (纏衣, lit. a &quot;Wrapping Raiment&quot; or &quot;Heavenly Raiment&quot;) and &quot;Yǔyī&quot;/&quot;Hagoromo&quot; (羽衣, lit. &#x27;Feather[ed] Raiment&#x27;)--that wrap loosely around their bodies (a parallel to the Christian Halo), as-well-as &quot;Gokō&quot; (後光, let. &#x27;back[ground] light&#x27; or &#x27;aureole&#x27;; an actual halo)--the &quot;Húntiānlíng&quot;/&quot;Adaitenayao&quot; (浑天绫/渾天綾, lit. &quot;Armillary Sash&quot;), worn by Nezha, from Chinese mythology, is also a kind of &quot;Chányī&quot; / &quot;Yǔyī&quot;. They usually carry lotus blossoms as a symbol of enlightenment or play musical instruments such as the biwa, or flute.

==Religion==
&quot;Tennin&quot; (Devatās in Buddhist mythology) are believed to live in the Buddhist heaven as the companions to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Devatās, or spirit beings, often have homes in nature, like trees, river bends, or stones. People believe their power can be captured in amulets, such as clothing or jewelry, to bring good luck and well-being. From the start, local Buddhist practices welcomed the worship of these spirits, which helped Buddhism spread throughout Asia.

==Powers==
&quot;Tennin&quot; can fly, a fact generally indicated in art by their coloured or feathered kimono, called both &quot;Tenne&quot; (纏衣, lit. a &quot;Wrapping Raiment&quot; or &quot;Heavenly Raiment&quot;) and &quot;Hagoromo&quot; (羽衣, lit. &#x27;Feather[ed] Raiment&#x27;). In some legends, &quot;tennin&quot; are unable to fly without these kimono (and thus cannot return to heaven). More rarely, they are shown with feathered wings. In a Noh play &quot;Hagoromo&quot;, which bears a number of similarities to the Western swan maiden legends, &quot;tennyo&quot; come to the earth and take off their &quot;hagoromo&quot;. A fisherman spies them and hides their clothes in order to force one to marry him. After some years he tells his wife what he did, and she finds her clothes and returns to heaven. The legend says it occurred on the beach of Miho no Matsubara, now a part of the city of Shizuoka.

<text>are figures in Japanese folklore analogous to the Western concept of ghosts. The name consists of two kanji, (&quot;yū&quot;), meaning &quot;faint&quot; or &quot;dim&quot; and (&quot;rei&quot;), meaning &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;. Alternative names include , meaning ruined or departed spirit, , meaning dead spirit, or the more encompassing or . Like their Western counterparts, they are thought to be spirits barred from a peaceful afterlife.

==Japanese afterlife==
According to traditional Japanese beliefs, all humans have a spirit or soul called a . When a person dies, the &quot;reikon&quot; leaves the body and enters a form of purgatory, where it waits for the proper funeral and post-funeral rites to be performed so that it may join its ancestors. If this is done correctly, the &quot;reikon&quot; is believed to be a protector of the living family and to return yearly in August during the Obon Festival to receive thanks.

However, if the person dies in a sudden or violent manner such as murder or suicide, if the proper rites have not been performed, or if they are influenced by powerful emotions such as a desire for revenge, love, jealousy, hatred or sorrow, the &quot;reikon&quot; is believed to transform into a &quot;yūrei&quot; which can then bridge the gap back to the physical world. The emotion or thought need not be particularly strong or driven. Even innocuous thoughts can cause death to become disturbed. Once a thought enters the mind of a dying person, their &quot;yūrei&quot; will come back to complete the action last thought of before returning to the cycle of reincarnation.

The &quot;yūrei&quot; then exists on Earth until it can be laid to rest, either by performing the missing rituals or resolving the emotional conflict that still ties it to the physical plane. If the rituals are not completed or the conflict left unresolved, the &quot;yūrei&quot; will persist in its haunting.

Oftentimes the lower the social rank of the person who died violently or who was treated harshly during life, the more powerful as a &quot;yūrei&quot; they would return. This is illustrated in the fate of Oiwa in the story &quot;Yotsuya Kaidan&quot;, or the servant Okiku in &quot;Banchō Sarayashiki&quot;.

==Appearance==

In the late 17th century, a game called &quot;Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai&quot; became popular, and &quot;kaidan&quot; increasingly became a subject for theater, literature and other arts. &quot;Ukiyo-e&quot; artist Maruyama Ōkyo created the first known example of the now-traditional &quot;yūrei&quot;, in his painting &quot;The Ghost of Oyuki&quot;. The Zenshō-an in Tokyo houses the largest single collection of &quot;yūrei&quot; paintings which are only shown in August, the traditional month of the spirits.

Today, the appearance of &quot;yūrei&quot; is somewhat uniform, instantly signaling the ghostly nature of the figure, and assuring that it is culturally authentic.

* White clothing: &quot;Yūrei&quot; are usually dressed in white, signifying the white burial kimono used in Edo period funeral rituals. In Shinto, white is a color of ritual purity, traditionally reserved for priests and the dead. This kimono can either be a &quot;katabira&quot; (a plain, white, unlined kimono) or a &quot;kyokatabira&quot; (a white katabira inscribed with Buddhist sutras). They are sometimes depicted wearing a , a small white triangular piece of cloth typically displayed on the forehead.
* Black hair: The hair of a &quot;yūrei&quot; is often long, black and disheveled, which some believe to be a trademark carried over from kabuki theater, where wigs are used for all actors. This is a misconception: Japanese women traditionally grew their hair long and wore it pinned up, and it was let down for the funeral and burial.
* Hands and feet: The hands of a &quot;yūrei&quot; are said to dangle lifelessly from the wrists, which are held outstretched with the elbows near the body. They typically lack legs and feet, floating in the air. These features originated in Edo period &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; prints, and were quickly copied over to kabuki. In kabuki, this lack of legs and feet is often represented by using a very long kimono or even hoisting the actor into the air by a series of ropes and pulleys.
* Hitodama: &quot;Yūrei&quot; are frequently depicted as being accompanied by a pair of floating flames or will o&#x27; the wisps (&quot;hitodama&quot; in Japanese) in eerie colors such as blue, green, or purple. These ghostly flames are separate parts of the ghost rather than independent spirits.

==Classifications==
===&quot;Yūrei&quot;===

All Japanese ghosts are called &quot;yūrei&quot;, and there are several types within this classification. However, a given ghost may be described by more than one of the following terms, as the following terms are used differently depending on which elements of a ghost&#x27;s characteristics are focused on:

* &quot;Onryō&quot;: The term &quot;onryō&quot; refers to the spirit of a person who died with a grudge or hatred and was feared by people as bringing disaster through possession.
* &quot;Ubume&quot;: A mother ghost who died in childbirth, or died leaving young children behind. This &quot;yūrei&quot; returns to care for her children, often bringing them sweets.
* &quot;Goryō&quot;: The term &quot;goryō&quot; refers to the spirit of a noble or accomplished person who became an &quot;onryō&quot; after losing a political power struggle or dying prematurely from an epidemic. It is a type of &quot;onryō&quot;.
* &quot;Funayūrei&quot;: The ghosts of those who died at sea. These ghosts are sometimes depicted as scaly fish-like humanoids and some may even have a form similar to that of a mermaid or merman.
* &quot;Zashiki-warashi&quot;: The ghosts of children, who are described as mischievous and like pulling pranks on the living. They are often mentioned in the local folklore of Iwate Prefecture, and are said to bring good fortune to the houses they inhabit.
* : These spirits do not seek to fulfill an exact purpose and wander around aimlessly. In ancient times, the disease of the Emperor of Japan was thought to arise as a result of these spirits floating in the air. Alternatively, &quot;fuyūrei&quot; refer to ghosts in which only the body of the deceased has perished and only the soul floats in the air. When used in this sense, &quot;onryō&quot; and &quot;goryō&quot; are both types of &quot;fuyūrei&quot;.
* : Similar to a &quot;fuyūrei&quot; and rare, these spirits do not seek to fulfill an exact purpose and are instead bound to a specific place or situation. Famous examples of this include the famous story of Okiku at the well of Himeji Castle and the hauntings in the film &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge&quot;.

===Buddhist ghosts===

There are two types of ghosts specific to Buddhism, both being examples of unfulfilled earthly hungers being carried on after death. They are different from other classifications of &quot;yūrei&quot; due to their religious nature:

* &quot;Gaki&quot;
* &quot;Jikininki&quot;

===&quot;Ikiryō&quot;===
In Japanese folklore, not only the dead are able to manifest their &quot;reikon&quot; for a haunting. Living creatures possessed by extraordinary jealousy or rage can release their spirit as an , a living ghost that can enact its will while still alive.

The most famous example of an &quot;ikiryo&quot; is &quot;Rokujō no Miyasundokoro&quot;, from the novel &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. A mistress of the titular Genji who falls deeply in love with him, the lady Rokujō is an ambitious woman whose ambition is denied upon the death of her husband. The jealousy she repressed over Genji transformed her slowly into a demon, and then took shape as an &quot;ikiryō&quot; upon discovering that Genji&#x27;s wife was pregnant. This &quot;ikiryō&quot; possessed Genji&#x27;s wife, ultimately leading to her demise. Upon realising that her jealousy had caused this misfortune, she locked herself away and became a nun until her death, after which time her spirit continued to haunt Genji until her daughter performed the correct spiritual rites.

==Hauntings==
&quot;Yūrei&quot; often fall under the general umbrella term of obake, derived from the verb bakeru, meaning &quot;to change&quot;; thus obake are preternatural beings who have undergone some sort of change, from the natural realm to the supernatural.

However, &quot;yūrei&quot; differ from traditional &quot;bakemono&quot; due to their temporal specificity. The &quot;yūrei&quot; is one of the only creatures in Japanese mythology to have a preferred haunting time (midtime of the hours of the Ox; around 2:00 am–2:30 am, when the veils between the world of the dead and the world of the living are at their thinnest). By comparison, normal &quot;obake&quot; could strike at any time, often darkening or changing their surroundings should they feel the need. Similarly, &quot;yūrei&quot; are more bound to specific locations of haunting than the average &quot;bakemono,&quot; which are free to haunt any place without being bound to it.&quot;&quot;

Yanagita Kunio generally distinguishes &quot;yūrei&quot; from &quot;obake&quot; by noting that &quot;yūrei&quot; tend to have a specific purpose for their haunting, such as vengeance or completing unfinished business. While for many &quot;yūrei&quot; this business is concluded, some &quot;yūrei&quot;, such as Okiku, remain earthbound due to the fact that their business is not possible to complete. In the case of Okiku, this business is counting plates hoping to find a full set, but the last plate is invariably missing or broken according to the different retellings of the story. This means that their spirit can never find peace, and thus will remain a &quot;jibakurei&quot;.

===Famous hauntings===
Some famous locations that are said to be haunted by &quot;yūrei&quot; are the well of Himeji Castle, haunted by the ghost of Okiku, and Aokigahara, the forest at the bottom of Mount Fuji, which is a popular location for suicide. A particularly powerful &quot;onryō&quot;, known as Oiwa, is said to be able to bring vengeance on any actress portraying her part in a theater or film adaptation.

Okiku, Oiwa, and the lovesick Otsuyu together make up the of Japanese culture. These are &quot;yūrei&quot; whose stories have been passed down and retold throughout the centuries, and whose characteristics along with their circumstances and fates have formed a large part of Japanese art and society.

==Exorcism==
The easiest way to exorcise a &quot;yūrei&quot; is to help it fulfill its purpose. When the reason for the strong emotion binding the spirit to Earth is gone, the &quot;yūrei&quot; is satisfied and can move on. Traditionally, this is accomplished by family members enacting revenge upon the &quot;yūrei&quot;″s slayer, or when the ghost consummates its passion/love with its intended lover, or when its remains are discovered and given a proper burial with all rites performed.

The emotions of the &quot;onryō&quot; are particularly strong, and they are the least likely to be pacified by these methods.

On occasion, Buddhist priests and mountain ascetics were hired to perform services on those whose unusual or unfortunate deaths could result in their transition into a vengeful ghost, a practice similar to exorcism. Sometimes these ghosts would be deified in order to placate their spirits.

Like many monsters of Japanese folklore, malicious &quot;yūrei&quot; are repelled by , holy Shinto writings containing the name of a &quot;kami&quot;. The &quot;ofuda&quot; must generally be placed on the &quot;yūrei&quot;″s forehead to banish the spirit, although they can be attached to a house&#x27;s entry ways to prevent the &quot;yūrei&quot; from entering.

<text>Kazan Federal University (; ) is a public research university located in Kazan, Russia.

The university was founded in 1804 as Imperial Kazan University, which makes it the second oldest continuously existing tertiary education institution in Russia. Founder of non-Euclidean geometry Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky served there as the rector from 1827 until 1846. In 1925, the university was renamed in honour of its student Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin). The university is known as the birthplace of organic chemistry due to works by Aleksandr Butlerov, Vladimir Markovnikov, Aleksandr Arbuzov, and the birthplace of electron spin resonance discovered by Evgeny Zavoisky. 

In 2011, Kazan University received a federal status. It is also one of 18 Russian universities that were initially selected to participate in the Project 5-100, coordinated by the Government of the Russian Federation and aimed to improve their international competitiveness among the world&#x27;s leading research and educational centers. In 2021, KFU joined Priority 2030, Russia&#x27;s new academic excellence project.

As of early 2023, the university comprised 20 primary educational units, 3 of which were territorial branches, including one overseas branch in Uzbekistan. More than 52,000 students were enrolled in over 600 degree programs at undergraduate and postgraduate level (including doctoral and double-degree programs with partner universities); the number of international students was about 11,500 from 101 countries. Current research priorities are biomedicine, materials science, hydrocarbon industry, new energy sources, IT and cyber-physical systems, and comprehensive development of human potential.

==History==
Among the subjects of pride are the creation of non-Euclidean geometry by Nikolai Lobachevsky, the discovery of the chemical element Ruthenium by Karl Ernst Claus, the theory of chemical structure of organic compounds by Aleksandr Butlerov, the discovery of electron paramagnetic resonance by Yevgeny Zavoisky and acoustic paramagnetic resonance by Semen Altshuler, the development of organophosphorus chemical compounds by Alexander and Boris Arbuzovs.

Among the university students and alumni there are the founder of the Soviet Union Vladimir Lenin, writers Sergei Aksakov, Leo Tolstoy, Pavel Melnikov-Pechersky, Velimir Khlebnikov, composer Mily Balakirev, and painter Valery Yakobi.

===Imperial period===

Kazan University was founded on November 17, 1804, when Emperor Alexander I signed the Affirmative Letter and the Charter about the creation of the Kazan Imperial University. The first students, enrolled in 1805, were graduates of the First Kazan Gymnasium – an autonomous affiliate of Moscow State University, under whose auspices Kazan University first operated. It was not until 1814 that the university underwent its full opening. It was restructured as a classical university comprising four departments: moral and political sciences, physical and mathematical sciences, medical sciences and philology. Before Tomsk University was founded, the University of Kazan used to be the easternmost university in the Russian Empire, it was thus serving for Volga, Kama, and Ural regions, Siberia and the Caucasus.

In 1819, M. L. Magnitsky conducted a review of the university, in which he reported on &#x27;the spirit of dissent and irreligion&#x27; that he had observed at the university. In his report to the Emperor, he spoke of the &quot;public destruction&quot; of the university and demanded it be closed, but Alexander I put the resolved &#x27;why destroy what can be corrected&#x27;. Magnitsky was consequently appointed trustee of the Kazan school district, an action that negatively affected the university, with many professors being dismissed and &#x27;harmful&#x27; books withdrawn from the library&#x27;s collection. In addition, a strict barrack domestic regime was introduced for students of the university.

In 1819–1821 an alumnus and scholar of Kazan University Ivan Simonov participated in the discovery of Antarctica during the first round-the-world expedition and pioneered Antarctic studies.

In 1825, the Main Building of the university was built and, in 1830, the Main Campus was completed. This included the Library Building, Chemical Laboratory, dissection facilities, astronomical observatory, and clinics. It was the scientific faculties that were, at this time, organised into a number of research schools: mathematical, chemical, medical, geological.

In 1834, the journal &quot;Proceedings of Kazan University&quot; began to be published by academicians of the university and in 1835 Nicholas I ordered to establish three faculties: Philosophical (which was further subdivided into verbal and physical-mathematical departments), Faculty of Law and Faculty of Medicine.

In 1844, Karl Klaus, a professor at the university, discovered, and named in honour of Russia, Ruthenium, the only chemical element discovered in Tsarist Russia. Six years thereafter St. Petersburg University opened the Institute of Oriental Studies and all training materials and collections of Kazan University in this field were transferred to the capital of Imperial Russia. Shortly after that, there was a further reform of the university&#x27;s structure, when in 1863, by the order of Alexander II, the university was reorganised into four departments: History and Philology, Physics and Mathematics, Law, and Medicine. A linguistic school was forming at the university during 1875–1883.
Around that time Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin), a future leader of the Soviet Union, studied law at the university from August 1887 until his expulsion due to &#x27;student disturbances&#x27; in December 1887.

The university faced one of its greatest challenges during the Russian Civil War, when in August–September 1918 the siege and ultimate capture of Kazan by the Red Army and Czechoslovak Corps led to a large exodus of students and faculty members from the city. Subsequently, many of them were enrolled in state universities in Siberia and help they provided proved instrumental in the foundation of universities in Tomsk and Irkutsk.

====Kazan Higher Women&#x27;s Courses====
Though approval was given in the Imperial period for Women to audit university lectures from 1859, the Higher Courses were not state funded and required local support, carrying high tuition fees. When petitioned by the university to create courses for women, Dmitry Tolstoy suggested that a curriculum modeled on the Guerrier Courses might be acceptable, though he continuously blocked their implementation in Kazan. In 1876, the imperial government, hoping to secure more qualified teachers, authorized creation of Higher Women&#x27;s Courses in all cities in the empire which had a university. From October 1876, female applicants who had completed a girls&#x27; gymnasium; were certified instructors in arithmetic, history and Russian language; or passed an entrance examination could enroll in evening classes at Kazan University. Those who did not meet those requirements could attend as external auditors, but were excluded from course examinations. Students took six mandatory courses in art history, physics, Russian history and literature, and world history and literature. Optional courses included hygiene, languages, and mathematics.

In 1879, the founder of the Kazan Higher Women&#x27;s Courses, N. V. Sorokin, expanded the offerings to include two specializations: &quot;historical-philological and physico-mathematical&quot;. This opened up additional course offerings including algebra and geometry, chemistry, English language, German literature, geography, history of philosophy, history of physical and mathematical sciences, history of physics, and natural sciences. In 1881, aesthetics was added and in 1884, Latin began being offered as an elective class. The courses allowed women to access higher education for a decade before being permanently closed in 1886. In 1904, professors of the university formed a committee to reinstate the women&#x27;s courses, but the plan was rejected because of it was economically not feasible. The plan was refused again in 1905, but in 1906, after the Revolution, authorities allowed the university to reinstate the Higher Women&#x27;s Courses of the historical-philological department. The first Latvian to earn a degree in Folkloric Studies, Anna Bērzkalne, graduated as a Candidate of Philology from the Kazan Higher Women&#x27;s Courses in 1917.

===Soviet period===

In accordance with a directive from the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars issued on October 9, 1918, the system of academic ranks was abolished and all university-level lecturers with at least three years of teaching experience were qualifying for the title of professor. This allowed the University of Kazan, which had lost the vast majority of its academic staff during the turmoil of the civil war, to restart proper education and research.

The university opened a &#x27;workers&#x27; faculty (fifth in the RSFSR), which aimed to provide the education for peasants. On 1 November 1919 peasant workers started their first classes without the requirement to pass an entrance exam. In 1922 the university&#x27;s Faculty of Forestry merged with the Faculty of Agriculture of Kazan Polytechnic university to form Kazan Institute of Agriculture and Forestry.

In 1925 by the decision of All-Russian Central Executive Committee Kazan State University was renamed to the V. I. Ulyanov-Lenin Kazan State University. This was done in order to recognise the period of time Vladimir Lenin spent as a student at the University of Kazan.

In the 1930s the university continued to evolve with a number of its faculties being separated from it in order to become independent institutions of higher education. Some of them continue their existence, for instance Kazan State Medical University. Moreover, during the World War II years (1941–43) a number of members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences were evacuated from Moscow and Leningrad and housed under the premises of the university; this, in turn, led to the foundation of Kazan Department of the academy in 1945.

In the post-war years the University of Kazan underwent a period of expansion and development of its academic base. To recognize the work in providing education to the peoples of the Soviet Union Kazan State University was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1953 and later, in 1979, the Order of Lenin. In the 1970s the university&#x27;s two high-rise academic buildings were built – the Department of Physics in 1973 and Faculty of Mathematics in 1978. The final major Soviet-era change to the university came with the opening of UNICS Sports Center and Concert Hall in 1989.

=== 21st century ===
On October 21, 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a presidential decree that established a new Volga Federal University on the basis of Kazan State University. The federal university project is realized on the basis of Kazan State University, with the accession of the Tatar State University of Humanities and Education (TGGPU), Kazan State Finance and Economics Institute (KGFEI), Elabuga State Pedagogical University and Naberezhnye Chelny Academy of Engineering and Economy. The university&#x27;s first rector is Ilshat Gafurov, formerly the mayor of Elabuga. The current president is Myakzyum Salakhov.

In 2013 Kazan Federal University launched the Programme for enhancing its competitive ranking among leading world centres of higher education and research (2013–20) in the framework of implementation of the Government Resolution No. 211 «On measures of federal support for the leading universities of the Russian Federation in order to enhance their competitiveness among the leading world scientific and educational centers» (signed on 16 March 2013).

Dmitry Albertovich Tayursky, Rector of the university, was suspended by the European University Association (EUA) following support for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Union of Rectors (RUR) in March 2022, for being &quot;diametrically opposed to the European values that they committed to when joining EUA&quot;.

==Rankings and reputation==

After having obtained the status of a federal university, KFU tasked itself with advancing in the global rankings race. This is also the primary metric for the participants of the Project , a national initiative to boost the competitiveness of the top Russian universities, which Kazan University joined in 2013. The new academic excellence project for Russian universities, Priority 2030, of which KFU is part, does not have rankings advancement among its stated objectives.

The university has been ranked by QS World University Rankings since 2012, steadily climbing from 601+ to 322nd place. It also had 5+ stars in QS Stars Ratings, the only university in Russia to have been so ranked as of November 2020.

KFU first appeared in Academic Ranking of World Universities in 2018 and was ranked 801 – 900 in that year and in 2019.

The university is present in multiple subject areas in QS subject rankings and Times Higher Education subject rankings.

==Campus==
Kazan Federal University&#x27;s Main Campus is located in downtown Kazan, 10 minutes away by foot from the Kazan Kremlin. The Main Building of Kazan University was designed by architect Petr Pyatnitsky and built in the 1820s. The oldest part of the today&#x27;s Main Building includes three classic portals along with the white foreside of the original 1822 construction. From 1832 to 1841, architect M. Korinfsky designed the rest of the buildings comprising the neo-classical Architectural Complex of Kazan University. The Main Building Yard now contains the central administrative offices, the Anatomical Theatre, the Library, chemistry and physics laboratories, and the Observatory.

Chemical Faculty Building (since 2003: Alexander Butlerov Chemistry Institute) was built in 1953 with the support of students. The original building was built in the Soviet neoclassical style. In 1960-70s, two high-rise academic buildings were erected to the north and to the west of the Main Building. The most recent addition was in 2015, when a 7-storey laboratory building was added to the campus.

By President Boris Yeltsin’s Decree in 1996, the Architectural Complex of Kazan University was added to the National Cultural Heritage Register of Russia. During the preparations for 200th anniversary of KFU the East Wing was added to the Main Building and today along with the university administration, the Museum of History of Kazan University, Yevgeny Zavoisky Lab-Museum, the Botanical Museum, Edward Eversman Zoology Museum, and two academic units – the Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology together with the Faculty of Law reside there. University sport facilities include UNICS and Bustan Sports Centers built in 1989 and 2010.

KFU dormitory campus is located in the Universiade Village, built to accommodate participants of the XXVII World Summer Universiade 2013. Altogether, the premises of Kazan University are located throughout Russia in Tatarstan, Karachay-Cherkessia, Karelia, Mari El, and some other provinces and in other countries. The university is a co-user of the RTT-150 telescope at the TÜBİTAK National Observatory in Turkey.

== Organization ==
The main campus of Kazan Federal University is located in Kazan and is divided into 15 institutes, 1 faculty and 1 higher school. The university also has three branches in Naberezhnye Chelny, Yelabuga, and Jizzakh, which all offer a variety of majors. A separate entity, Higher School of Public Administration, is also a part of the university but does not offer courses in tertiary education, as its sole purpose is to provide short-term advanced training to public servants. The university offers the majority of its programs in Russian. Prospective students may opt to enroll in KFU&#x27;s Preparatory Sсhool to learn Russian or English, depending on their chosen program. English programs are offered in several specializations, including a full six-year MBBS course and a four-year international business course.

==Global cooperation==
The foundation of Kazan University was directly linked to international academia. Some of the university&#x27;s first teachers were German professors such as Johann Bartels, Franz Erdman and Christian Fren. The German professor Karl Fuchs, who was both the founder of Kazan Medical School and the first European researcher of Tatar history and culture, became the university&#x27;s rector in the 1820s and was awarded the title of Honourable Citizen of Kazan.

KFU has partner agreements with approximately 190 universities and research centres from more than 53 countries all over the world. Thanks to its fruitful cooperation with the long-term partners such as Justus-Liebig University of Giessen (Germany), the Superior Institute of Materials and Advance Mechanics (ISMANS, France), Research Institute RIKEN (Japan) and others, KFU has taken advantage of participating in various research programmes and implementing double diploma programs and cotutelle agreements.

In the 2015–2016 academic year, about 3000 international students were studying in KFU on different academic programmes.

Each year, more than 900 students and faculty members of KFU visited foreign universities and research centres for various purposes, including international conferences. About 1500 specialists from abroad were involved in various scientific events, development and introduction of new courses, research collaboration and other international activity at KFU. Native speaking specialists teach Chinese, Korean, Farsi, German, Spanish, English and other foreign languages on a regular basis at KFU. In October 2016, KFU and the Southwest Petroleum University entered into a cooperation agreement at Karamay. Among the honorary doctors and professors of KFU there are Vladimir Minkin, Alexei Starobinsky, Ichak Kalderon Adizes, Rashid Sunyaev, Anatole Abragam, Karl Alexander Müller, Brebis Bleaney, Ryoji Noyori, Mikhail Piotrovsky, Vitaly Ginzburg, and other scientists and Nobel prizers.

Every year KFU academic staff carried out on average 40 joint international projects and got individual support for research and study from DAAD, DFG, Volkswagen Foundation, NSF, European Commission (Tempus, FP7, Marie-Curie Actions, Erasmus-Mundus, etc.) and other grant making organizations.

KFU carry out several big projects on Mega-grants received from the Russian Government in the framework of Resolution No.220 of the Government of the Russian Federation &quot;On measures designed to attract the world’s leading scientists to Russian institutions of higher learning, research organizations of the governmental academies of sciences, and governmental research centers of the Russian Federation&quot; and Resolution No 218 of the Government of the Russian Federation &quot;On promoting cooperation between higher educational institutions and organizations implementing comprehensive high-technology production&quot;: 
* International research laboratory &quot;Neurobiology. Early activity in the developing brain.&quot; The project is implemented jointly with the Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM) (France);
* Joint project of KFU and «Nizhnekamskneftekhim»: &quot;Increasing effectiveness for obtaining monomers of synthetic rubber by development and distribution of advanced catalysts of isoamylene dehydration&quot;.
* Joint project of KFU and TNG Group: «Development of innovative technologies and industrial management of equipment and software for effective investigation of resources for the purpose of identification of hydrocarbon deposits and supervision of their development».
* Joint project of KFU and &quot;Tasma&quot; Co.: &quot;Development and Production of competitive photorecording materials&quot;.

Starting from 2011 Kazan University implements a large-scale project &quot;Pharma 2020&quot; financed within Federal Target Program of Russian Federation &quot;Development of pharmaceutical and medical industry till 2020 and following perspectives&quot; (Pharma-2020). Research and Education Center of Pharmaceutics was established providing interdisciplinary research for development and production of drugs.

The university administration and faculty have paid special attention to the European Tempus and Erasmus scheme for cooperation, with over a dozen large-scale projects which have been successfully implemented during the last 20 years. Today KFU students and academic staff enjoyed wonderful opportunities of training at best European universities as part of both &quot;Integration, Interaction and Institutions (Triple I)&quot; and &quot;Aurora&quot; projects (Erasmus Mundus program).

<text>Alwin Lopez Jarreau (March 12, 1940 – February 12, 2017) was an American singer and songwriter. His 1981 album &quot;Breakin&#x27; Away&quot; spent two years on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and is considered one of the finest examples of the Los Angeles pop and R&amp;B sound. The album won Jarreau the 1982 Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. In all, he won ten Grammy Awards and was nominated 19 other times during his career.

Jarreau also sang the theme song of the 1980s television series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and was among the performers on the 1985 charity song &quot;We Are the World&quot;.

==Early life and career==

Jarreau was born in Milwaukee on March 12, 1940, the fifth of six children. His father Emile Alphonse Jarreau was a Seventh-day Adventist Church minister and singer, and his mother Pearl (Walker) Jarreau was a church pianist. Jarreau and his family sang together in church concerts and in benefits, and Jarreau and his mother performed at PTA meetings.

Jarreau was student council president and Badger Boys State delegate for Lincoln High School. At Boys State, he was elected governor. Jarreau went on to attend Ripon College, where he also sang with a group called the Indigos. He graduated in 1962 with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. Two years later, in 1964, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in vocational rehabilitation from the University of Iowa. Jarreau also worked as a rehabilitation counselor in San Francisco, and moonlighted with a jazz trio headed by George Duke. In 1967, he joined forces with acoustic guitarist Julio Martinez. The duo became the star attraction at a small Sausalito night club called Gatsby&#x27;s. This success contributed to Jarreau&#x27;s decision to make professional singing his life and full-time career.

==Career==


In 1968, Jarreau made jazz his primary occupation. In 1969, he and Martinez headed south, where Jarreau appeared at Dino&#x27;s, The Troubadour, and Bitter End West. Television exposure came from Johnny Carson, Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin, Dinah Shore, and David Frost. He expanded his nightclub appearances, performing at The Improv between the acts of such rising stars as Bette Midler, Jimmie Walker, and John Belushi. During this period, he became involved with the United Church of Religious Science and the Church of Scientology. Also, roughly at the same time, he began writing his own lyrics, finding that his Christian spirituality began to influence his work.

In 1975, Jarreau was working with pianist Tom Canning when he was spotted by Warner Bros. Records. Soon he released his critically acclaimed debut album, &quot;We Got By&quot;, which catapulted him to international fame and won an Echo Award (the German equivalent of the Grammys in the United States). On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1976, he sang on the 13th episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, that week hosted by Peter Boyle. A second Echo Award would follow with the release of his second album, &quot;Glow&quot;. In 1978, he won his first Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance for his album, &quot;Look to the Rainbow&quot;.

One of Jarreau&#x27;s most commercially successful albums is &quot;Breakin&#x27; Away&quot; (1981), which includes the hit song &quot;We&#x27;re in This Love Together&quot;. He won the 1982 Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Breakin&#x27; Away&quot;. In 1983 he released &quot;Jarreau&quot;. It was his third consecutive #1 album on the Billboard Jazz charts, while also placing at #4 on the R&amp;B album charts and #13 on the Billboard 200. The album contained three hit singles: &quot;Mornin&#x27;&quot; (U.S. Pop #21, AC #2 for three weeks), &quot;Boogie Down&quot; (U.S. Pop #77) and &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; (U.S. Pop #63, AC #10). In 1984 the album received four Grammy Award nominations, including for Jay Graydon as Producer of the Year (Non-Classical).

In 1984, his single &quot;After All&quot; reached 69 on the US Hot 100 chart and number 26 on the R&amp;B chart. His last big hit was the Grammy-nominated theme to the 1980s American television show &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, for which he wrote the lyrics. Among other things, he was well known for his extensive use of scat singing (for which he was called &quot;Acrobat of Scat&quot;), and vocal percussion. He was also a featured vocalist on USA for Africa&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot; in which he sang the line, &quot;...and so we all must lend a helping hand.&quot; Another charitable media event, HBO&#x27;s Comic Relief, featured him in a duet with Natalie Cole singing the song &quot;Mr. President&quot;, written by Joe Sterling, Mike Loveless, and Ray Reach.

Jarreau took an extended break from recording in the 1990s. As he explained in an interview with &quot;Jazz Review&quot;: &quot;I was still touring, in fact, I toured more than I ever had in the past, so I kept in touch with my audience. I got my symphony program under way, which included my music and that of other people too, and I performed on the Broadway production of &quot;Grease&quot;. I was busier than ever! For the most part, I was doing what I have always done... perform live. I was shopping for a record deal and was letting people know that there is a new album coming. I was just waiting for the right label (Verve), but I toured more than ever.&quot; In 2003, Jarreau and conductor Larry Baird collaborated on symphony shows around the United States, with Baird arranging additional orchestral material for Jarreau&#x27;s shows.

Jarreau toured and performed with Joe Sample, Chick Corea, Kathleen Battle, Miles Davis, George Duke, David Sanborn Rick Braun, and George Benson. He also performed the role of the Teen Angel in a 1996 Broadway production of &quot;Grease.&quot; On March 6, 2001, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 7083 Hollywood Boulevard on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue. In 2006, Jarreau appeared in a duet with &quot;American Idol&quot; finalist Paris Bennett during the Season 5 finale and on &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot; singing with actor Cheech Marin. In 2009, children&#x27;s author Carmen Rubin published the story &quot;Ashti Meets Birdman Al&quot;, inspired by Jarreau&#x27;s music. In 2010, Jarreau was a guest on a Eumir Deodato album, with the song &quot;Double Face&quot; written by Jarreau, Deodato, and Nicolosi. The song was produced by the Italian company Nicolosi Productions. On February 16, 2012, Jarreau was invited to the famous Italian Festival di Sanremo to sing with the Italian group Matia Bazar.

==Personal life==
Jarreau was married twice. Jarreau and Phyllis Hall were married from 1964 until their divorce in 1968. Jarreau married his second wife in 1977. Jarreau and Player had a son, Ryan Jarreau. Ryan and Susan Jarreau appear as background vocalists on &quot;Tomorrow Today&quot;. Susan provided photography for several of Jarreau&#x27;s albums, including &quot;Glow&quot;, &quot;All Fly Home&quot;, &quot;This Time&quot;, and &quot;Breakin&#x27; Away&quot;. She is the subject of &quot;Susan&#x27;s Song&quot;, track no. 3 on &quot;We Got By&quot;.

==Illness and death==
It was reported in July 2010 that Jarreau was critically ill at a hospital in France, after performing in Barcelonnette, and was being treated for respiratory problems and cardiac arrhythmias. He was conscious, in a stable condition and in the cardiology unit of La Timone hospital in Marseille, the Marseille Hospital Authority said, and he remained there for about a week for tests.

In June 2012, Jarreau was diagnosed with pneumonia, which caused him to cancel several concerts in France. Jarreau made a full recovery and continued to tour extensively for the next five years until February 2017.

In February 2017, after being hospitalized for exhaustion in Los Angeles, Jarreau canceled his remaining 2017 tour dates. On that date, the Montreux Jazz Academy, part of the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, announced that Jarreau would not return as a mentor to ten young artists, as he had done in 2015.

Jarreau died of respiratory failure, at the age of 76 on February 12, just two days after announcing his retirement, and one month before his 77th birthday.

He is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills). His headstone features lyrics from his song &quot;Mornin&#x27;&quot;: &quot;I know I can / Like any man / Reach out my hand / And touch the face of God.&quot;

<text>There are currently 64 national parks in Russia. They cover a total of approximately .

==Overview==

Until the 1960s only nature reserves (&quot;zapovedniks&quot;) and &quot;zakazniks&quot; existed in the Soviet Union, so international experience in creating a form of protected areas intended for tourists to relax and teach them to take care of nature was very important. In 1961, Soviet geographers, headed by Innokenti Gerasimov, director of the Institute of Geography, USSR Academy of Sciences, visited the United States. This trip was an introduction to the USA experience in environmental protection and Soviet scientists visited the Yellowstone National Park and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

After the trip, Innokenti Gerasimov returned to the idea of creating nature parks in the USSR. In 1965 he proposed the creation of a Baikal nature park. A similar natural park was also designed in the Lake Seliger area on the Valdai Hills. In 1966, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda published an article by Innokenti Gerasimov and Vladimir Preobrazhensky, which discussed the need to create a system of natural parks in the USSR. Natural parks were not just thought of as places for tourists to relax, but also as places to protect animals and plants in areas that park tourists would not be allowed to visit without a guide.

The oldest parks in Russia are Sochinsky and Losiny Ostrov (1983); Samarskaya Luka (1984); Mariy Chodra (1985); Bashkiriya, Prielbrusye, Pribaykalsky, and Zabaykalsky (1986).

According to the law on the protected areas of Russia, national parks are areas of land and water devoted to nature protection, ecological education, and scientific research. They contain sites of particular ecological, historical and aesthetic value. Regulated tourism is permitted.
The area of each park is divided into zones according to various functions. There should be a strictly protected area managed as a zapovednik, and also recreational and buffer zones in which economic activity is allowed, such as tourism, traditional land use, and benign forms of agriculture and forestry. The strictly protected function is sometimes fulfilled by a neighbouring official zapovednik; for instance, Barguzin Zapovednik adjoins Zabaykalsky National Park on the east side of Lake Baikal.
In 2001 Vodlozersky National Park received UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status, followed by Smolenskoye Poozerye and Ugra National Park in 2002, and two others (Valdaysky and Kenozersky) in 2004. 

The national parks are currently the responsibility of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Russia).

<text>Stapleton Heights (or Stapleton Hill) is a neighborhood in northeastern Staten Island, New York City. It stands on the second of a series of hills that form a &quot;backbone&quot; running diagonally across the island from northeast to southwest, between Ward Hill (the first of the hills as they rise from Tompkinsville) and Grymes Hill; to the east is Stapleton, which is along the waterfront. It is an upper-middle-class enclave noted for its large older one-family homes, and for its view of Upper New York Bay and the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge. Many of the grander homes of the neighborhood were constructed in the late 19th century by the families who controlled the industries along the waterfront, including the breweries that operated there until the last one closed in 1963. One such home, on Louis Street, is allegedly &quot;haunted,&quot; according to local residents.

Stapleton Heights is served by the local buses.

<doc id="640889" wikidata="Q259993" url="?curid=640889" title="Rachel Hunter">
<text>Rachel Hunter (born 8 September 1969) is a New Zealand model, actress, and the host of Imagination Television&#x27;s &quot;Rachel Hunter&#x27;s Tour of Beauty&quot;. She has appeared on several magazine covers, including &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and &quot; Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. She has been on the cover of the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; twice: in 1994 (alongside Kathy Ireland and Elle Macpherson) and in 2006 (alongside six other models).

==Early life==
Hunter was born in Glenfield, a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand, and educated at Glenfield College. Her parents divorced when she was still a child. As a child she wanted to be a ballet dancer, but at 13 became ill with toxoplasmosis, which curtailed her dancing ambitions.

==Career==
=== Modelling ===
Hunter began her career at age 16, modelling in France, Australia and New Zealand, appearing in Australian &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, Australian &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and for various campaigns throughout New Zealand and Australia. She became the face of Tip Top Ice-Cream in New Zealand and was the &quot;Trumpet Girl&quot;. She was quickly signed up to Ford Models and immediately embarked on a successful career, landing a Cover Girl cosmetics contract and becoming the spokesperson for the company for several years. Hunter rose to global prominence after posing as a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; swimsuit model in 1989. She subsequently appeared on magazine covers, including &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and on the 1994 &quot;Dream Team&quot; cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s annual swimsuit issue with other supermodels Elle MacPherson and Kathy Ireland, and again graced its cover, this time solo, 12 years later in 2006. Hunter also appeared on the cover of &quot;Vogue Italia&quot;, Australian &quot;Vogue&quot;, American and international editions of &quot;Elle&quot; and Dutch &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.

Hunter posed nude for a cover-featured &quot;Playboy&quot; pictorial published in April 2004.

Hunter is signed to Ford Models in New York, Select Model Management in London, and Chadwick Models in Sydney.

===Acting===
Hunter first appeared on television in 1985 in an advertisement for the New Zealand ice cream brand Tip Top, promoting their &quot;Trumpet&quot; ice-cream.

Hunter guest starred in a 1997 episode of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; as herself. She has appeared in several independent films, including 1999&#x27;s &quot;A Walk in the Park&quot; and 2000&#x27;s &quot;Two Shades of Blue&quot;, an erotic thriller with Marlee Matlin. She stars as a lesbian cook doling out relationship advice in the award-winning indie film &quot;La Cucina&quot;. She had a brief appearance as a sexy mother in Dennis Dugan&#x27;s &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot; (2006) and also played a sultry, bikini-clad mother in the music video for Fountains of Wayne&#x27;s 2003 song &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot;.

Hunter was one of six celebrities in the inaugural cast of the American dance competition series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in 2005. She appeared on a 2005 celebrity episode of &quot;Lingo&quot;, where she and her partner Trista Rehn split $30,000 for charity. Hunter is an ambassador to The Born Free Foundation, and established the Rachel Hunter Lowland Gorilla Fund. Hunter also appeared as herself in the 2004 Christmas Special of &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;. She also starred in &quot;Confessions of a Go-Go Girl&quot; (2008), &quot;The Perfect Assistant&quot; (2008), the science fiction TV movies &quot;Piranhaconda&quot; (2011) and &quot;Swamp Volcano&quot;, aka &quot;Miami Magma&quot; (2012).
She appeared as a judge on &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; from 2012 to 2013. In 2015, Hunter fronted her own television series titled &quot;Rachel Hunter&#x27;s Tour of Beauty&quot; for TV One where she travelled the world to discover what beauty meant in various countries.

== Personal life ==

In the late 1980s, Hunter was in a relationship with rock musician Kip Winger.

At the age of 21, Hunter met rock star Rod Stewart, 24 years her senior, in a Los Angeles nightclub. They married three months later at the Beverly Hills Presbyterian Church in Beverly Hills, California, on 15 December 1990. Together they have two children: Renée (b. 1992) and Liam (b. 1994). They separated in January 1999 after eight years of marriage, and their divorce was finalised on 2 November 2006.

She had a year-long relationship with Canadian NHL ice hockey player Sean Avery in 2004, and in 2006 began a three-year relationship with Jarret Stoll, 13 years her junior, also a Canadian NHL player who played for, and won the Stanley Cup with, the Los Angeles Kings. Her son Liam was a junior player being mentored by him while playing for the LA Kings Juniors when they first met. Stoll proposed to Hunter in 2008 whilst he accompanied her on a trip home to her native New Zealand later that year and they were due to marry on 14 August 2009, but the wedding was called off by Stoll seven weeks prior to their wedding day.

<doc id="640892" wikidata="Q3968282" url="?curid=640892" title="Star Castle">
<text>Star Castle is a vector graphics multidirectional shooter released in arcades by Cinematronics in 1980. The game involves obliterating a series of defenses orbiting a stationary turret in the center of the screen. The display is black and white with the colors of the rings and screen provided by a transparent plastic overlay.

&quot;Star Castle&quot; was designed by Tim Skelly and programmed by Scott Boden. Skelly created a number of other Cinematronics vector games, including &quot;Starhawk&quot;, &quot;Armor Attack&quot;, and &quot;Rip Off&quot;. A Vectrex port of &quot;Star Castle&quot; was released in 1983.

==Gameplay==

The object of &quot;Star Castle&quot; is to destroy an enemy cannon which sits in the center of three concentric, rotating energy shield rings while avoiding or shooting &quot;mines&quot;–enemies that spawn from the core, pass through the energy rings, and then home in on the player&#x27;s ship. The player&#x27;s spaceship can rotate, thrust forward, and fire small projectiles. The cannon&#x27;s shields are composed of twelve sections, and each section takes two hits to destroy. Once a section is breached, rings beneath it are exposed to fire.

Once the innermost ring has been breached, the central weapon is susceptible to attack, but the player is also more vulnerable at this point, as with the shield rings eliminated, the gun can fire out a large projectile that hisses with white noise. Moreover, the central core tracks player movement at all times. If the player manages to hit the cannon, it explodes violently, collapsing the remnants of the shield rings, and an extra ship is awarded. The next level then starts with a new gun and fully restored shield rings, but the difficulty is increased (the mines move more rapidly, the rings rotate more quickly, and the core tracks the player at a faster rate).

If the player completely destroys the outermost shield ring, the cannon will create a new one. The middle ring expands to replace the lost outer ring, the inner ring replaces the middle, and a new ring emerges from the core to become the inner ring. Therefore, in order to penetrate the cannon&#x27;s defenses, the player must be careful not to completely obliterate the outer ring.

The three homing mines will destroy the player&#x27;s ship on contact. The mines can be destroyed, but they are very small and difficult to hit, and the player does not receive points for destroying them. Mines are revived when shield rings regenerate (some variants keep three mines churning constantly so that a new mine respawns from the core as soon as one is destroyed). As the player progresses through the levels, the mines get faster and faster, forcing the player to keep moving to avoid them.

== Reception ==
Michael Blanchet&#x27;s 1982 book &quot;How to Beat the Video Games&quot; praised &quot;Star Castle&quot; as &quot;a standout among the wave of free-flight games that emerged after &quot;Asteroids&quot;&quot;, describing the game&#x27;s increase in difficulty over time, rather than between game levels, as the &quot;catch&quot; which made it challenging. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Star Castle&quot; 83rd on their Top 100 Video Games list, calling it &quot;one of the all-time great vector graphics classics&quot;.

==Legacy==
In an interview, Skelly admitted that the stellar field was made using the shape of a woman from a nude magazine.

Atari, Inc. programmer Howard Scott Warshaw investigated writing a clone of &quot;Star Castle&quot; for the Atari 2600, but did not see the game as a good match for the system from a technical standpoint. He reconfigured the concept into &quot;Yars&#x27; Revenge&quot;, which became Atari&#x27;s top selling original game for the 2600. A hobbyist-written clone of &quot;Star Castle&quot; for the Atari 2600 was eventually released in 2012.

Jim Nitchals of Cavalier Computer wrote a clone for the Apple II called &quot;Ring Raiders&quot; (referenced in-game as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ring&quot;) published in 1981. Anthony Weber of Stedek Software wrote a clone for Atari 8-bit computers called &quot;Star Island&quot; (1982).

<doc id="640894" wikidata="Q339274" url="?curid=640894" title="James Duane">
<text>James Duane (February 6, 1733 – February 1, 1797) was an American Founding Father, attorney, jurist, and American Revolutionary leader from New York. He served as a delegate to the First Continental Congress, the Second Continental Congress and the Congress of the Confederation, a New York state senator, the 44th Mayor of New York City, the 1st post-colonial Mayor of New York City and a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of New York. Duane was a signatory of the Continental Association and the Articles of Confederation.

==Early life==

Duane was born on February 6, 1733, in New York City, in the Province of New York, to Anthony Duane and his second wife, Althea Ketaltas. Anthony Duane was a Protestant Irishman from County Galway who first came to New York as an officer of the Royal Navy in 1698. Duane&#x27;s surname is from the Irish O&#x27;Dubhain. In 1702, Anthony Duane left the navy to marry Eva Benson, daughter of Dirck Benson, a local merchant. They had two sons, Abraham and Cornelius. Duane prospered and bought land for investment, rental, and future development. After his wife&#x27;s death, Anthony married Althea Ketaltas (Hettletas), the daughter of a wealthy Dutch merchant. By the time of James&#x27; birth, his father had become a wealthy colonial settler. 

Duane&#x27;s mother died in 1736, and his father married a third time in 1741 to Margaret Riken (Rycken). When Anthony died in 1747, James became the ward of Robert Livingston, the 3rd Lord of Livingston Manor, where he completed his early education.

==Career==
Duane completed preparatory studies and read law in 1754, with James Alexander. He had an impressive command of the law and was admitted to the bar on August 3, 1754. He maintained a private practice in New York City from 1754 to 1762, when he became a clerk of the Chancery Court of New York. 

Duane was acting attorney general of the Province of New York in 1767 and a boundary commissioner in 1768 (and again in 1784), before returning to private practice in New York City in 1774 and 1775. He was a delegate to the New York Convention which ratified the United States Constitution in 1788. Duane was a member of the Federalist Party.

===Law practice and other activities===
Duane represented Trinity Church in the very protracted legal action brought by heirs of Anneke Jans, who claimed that they, and not the church, were the lawful owners of much of lower Manhattan, a tract which had been given to the church by the British crown. 

By the early 1770s, his practice earned him 1,400 pounds annually. At the height of his success, Duane had a house in Manhattan, one in the country, and an estate near Schenectady, New York, of and 253 tenants. He was a vestryman of Trinity Church, was appointed one of the church&#x27;s nine trustees during a post-war crisis about the church&#x27;s Tory leanings, and was also a trustee of Kings College, the precursor to Columbia University.

In 1761, Duane acquired from Gerardus Stuyvesant a farm known as &quot;Krom Mesje&quot; (&quot;little crooked knife&quot;) in reference to a small brook that flowed into the East River. He named it &quot;Gramercy Seat&quot;. In addition to the farm, Duane also had a house on King Street (later changed to Pine Street). In 1765, he was granted a patent for land in Schenectady County, which became the township of Duanesburg.

With his boyhood friend James De Lancey, Duane was one of the Socialborough Proprietors, holding an area obtained by grant in 1771 and located on both sides of Otter Creek in the present towns of Pittsford and Rutland, Vermont. 

===American Revolution===
Duane was politically conservative. Until his marriage to Mary Livingston, he had been a member of James De Lancey&#x27;s political faction, which opposed to the Crown&#x27;s policies but did not endorse the use of mob violence to protest British measures. His efforts to support resistance in New York led to his being chosen with others to represent the Province of New York at the Congressional meetings in Philadelphia. He remained active in both capacities. 

Duane was a delegate to the First Continental Congress held in Philadelphia during the autumn of 1774 in reaction to the British Navy&#x27;s blockade of Boston Harbor and the passage of the Intolerable Acts by Parliament in response to the December 1773 Boston Tea Party. He was one of the many who were most disposed to reconciliation with Britain and supported the Galloway Plan of Union, which was rejected by the majority of the delegates. Upon his return to New York, he was named to the &quot;Committee of Sixty&quot;, a committee of inspection formed in the City and County of New York (Manhattan, New York City) in 1775, to enforce the Continental Association, a boycott of British goods enacted by the First Continental Congress.

He was a delegate to the Provincial Convention held in New York City on April 20, 1775, where delegates were elected to the Second Continental Congress. It included the delegates to the First Congress as well as five new members. The scope of the Provincial Convention did not extend beyond electing delegates, who dispersed on April 22, the day before news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord arrived. The Second Continental Congress convened its first session on May 10. Duane served as a delegate from 1775 to 1781. Alexander Hamilton, an aide to General George Washington, wrote Duane to ask him to get Congress to expedite supplies.

The Committee of Sixty was replaced by a more representative Committee of One Hundred on May 1, 1775. The Committee still considered itself loyal to the British Crown but was opposed to the laws of the Parliament of Great Britain, which it considered unconstitutional because the colonies had no representation in it. The Committee of One Hundred was officially replaced by the New York Provincial Congress which first convened on May 23, 1775. Despite initial reservations regarding independence, he later supported the Declaration of Independence. Because of his service with the Provincial Congress, Duane was not in Philadelphia to sign the Declaration.

When the British occupied New York in late summer 1776, he withdrew his wife and family to the relative safety of her father&#x27;s home at Livingston Manor. He was a member of the New York Constitutional Convention which assembled at White Plains, New York, on Sunday evening, July 10, 1776, for the purpose of drafting a constitution to replace the colonial charter.

In July 1778 he signed the Articles of Confederation in Philadelphia. Duane was a member of the Congress of the Confederation from 1781 to 1783. He remained active as a political leader throughout the war and returned home to Gramercy Seat in 1783. He commented that his home looked &quot;as if they had been inhabited by wild beasts&quot;.

===Post war activities===
He was Mayor of New York City from 1784 to 1789, appointed by the Council of Appointment. As mayor, one of Duane&#x27;s first acts was to donate to the poor the money usually spent on entertainment for his inauguration, about 20 guineas. During his time in office, he strove to help the city revive itself after the damage done by the war and the British occupation, but he was unable to maintain the city&#x27;s status as the capital of the United States. As head of the Mayor&#x27;s Court, he heard the landmark case of &quot;Rutgers v. Waddington&quot;, handing down a Solomonic decision that pleased neither party. After he was called before the State Assembly to explain his thinking, he was censured by that body.

He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1782 to 1785, and from 1788 to 1790. In 1785, Duane was one of 32 prominent New Yorkers who met to create the New York Manumission Society, which was intended to put pressure on the state of New York to abolish slavery, as every state in the north had done except New York and New Jersey.

He was chosen a member of the Annapolis Convention in 1786 but did not attend.

===Federal judicial service===
Duane was nominated by President George Washington on September 25, 1789, to the United States District Court for the District of New York, to a new seat authorized by . He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 25, 1789, and received his commission on September 26, 1789. He resigned on March 17, 1794, because of ill health.

==Personal life==
On October 21, 1759, Duane married Mary Livingston (1738–1821), the eldest living daughter of his former guardian Robert. Their children were:

* Mary Duane (b. 1762), who married Gen. William North (1755–1836) on October 14, 1787
* Catharine L. Duane
* Adelia Duane (1765–1860), who married merchant Alfred Sands Pell. 
* James Chatham Duane (1769–1842), who married Mary Ann Bowers (1773–1828)
* Cornelius Duane (1774–1781), who died young
* Sarah Duane (1775–1828), who married George W. Featherstonhaugh (1780–1866) on November 6, 1808

Duane&#x27;s grandchildren included George W. Featherstonhaugh Jr. (1814–1900), Robert Livingston Pell (1811–1880), James Duane Pell (1813–1881), George W. Pell (1820–1896), and Richard Montgomery Pell (1822–1882). His great-grandchildren included Alfred Duane Pell (1864–1937) and James Chatham Duane (1824–1897).

==Death and legacy==
Duane died on February 1, 1797, in Duanesburg, Schenectady County, New York. He was interred under Christ Church in Duanesburg.

Duane Street in Manhattan was named in his honor. Duane Park, at the corner of Duane and Hudson streets is named for him. The Fire Department of New York operated a fireboat named &quot;James Duane&quot; from 1908 to 1959. The town of Duanesburg, New York, in the western part of Schenectady County, is named for James Duane, who held most of it as an original land grant.

The Northern District of New York Federal Court Bar Association presents the annual Judge James Duane Award upon &quot;...a distinguished member of the bar who has carried on Judge Duane’s legacy of excellence in the practice of law, unwavering integrity, and a tireless commitment to the legal profession.&quot; James Joseph Duane, an American law professor at the Regent University School of Law, is a living descendant of James Duane who has received online attention for his video lecture &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk To Police&quot;.

Ed Jewett portrayed Duane in the 2008 &quot;John Adams&quot; miniseries directed by Tom Hooper. He appeared in episode 2 &quot;Independence.&quot;

<doc id="640895" wikidata="Q1121095" url="?curid=640895" title="Mainline Protestant">
<text>The mainline Protestant churches (sometimes also known as oldline Protestants) are a group of Protestant denominations in the United States and Canada largely of the theologically liberal or theologically progressive persuasion that contrast in history and practice with the largely theologically conservative evangelical, fundamentalist, charismatic, confessional, Confessing Movement, historically Black church, and Global South Protestant denominations and congregations. Some make a distinction between &quot;mainline&quot; and &quot;oldline&quot;, with the former referring only to denominational ties and the latter referring to church lineage, prestige and influence. However, this distinction has largely been lost to history and the terms are now nearly synonymous.

Mainline Protestant churches have stressed social justice and personal salvation, and both politically and theologically, tend to be more liberal than non-mainline Protestant churches. Mainline Protestant churches share a common approach that often leads to collaboration in organizations such as the National Council of Churches, and because of their involvement with the ecumenical movement, they are sometimes given the alternative label of &quot;ecumenical Protestantism&quot; (especially outside the United States). While in 1970 the mainline Protestant churches claimed most Protestants and more than 30 percent of the American population as members, they are a minority among American Protestants, claiming approximately 15 percent of American adults. 

==Terminology==
The term &quot;mainline Protestant&quot; was coined during debates between modernists and fundamentalists in the 1920s. Several sources claim that the term is derived from the Philadelphia Main Line, a group of affluent suburbs of Philadelphia; most residents belonged to mainline denominations. Today, most mainline Protestants remain rooted in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. C. Kirk Hadaway and Penny Long Marler define the term as follows: &quot;the term &#x27;mainline Protestant&#x27; is used along with &#x27;mainstream Protestant&#x27; and &#x27;oldline Protestant&#x27; to categorize denominations that are affiliated with the National Council of Churches and have deep historical roots in and long-standing influence on American society.&quot;

In the US, Protestantism is generally divided between mainline denominations and evangelical or theologically conservative denominations. In other parts of the world, the term &quot;mainline Protestant&quot; is not used. Instead, the term &quot;ecumenical&quot; is used to distinguish similar churches from evangelical denominations. Some have criticized the term &quot;mainline&quot; for its alleged White Anglo-Saxon Protestant ethnocentric and elitist assumptions, and its erroneous association with the term &quot;mainstream&quot; since it almost exclusively described White American, non-fundamentalist and non-evangelical Protestant Americans from its origin to the late twentieth century.

===&quot;Mainline&quot; vs. &quot;mainstream&quot;===
The term &quot;mainstream Christian&quot; in academic usage is not equivalent to &quot;mainline Protestant&quot; and is often used as an attempt to find impartial sociological vocabulary in distinguishing &quot;orthodoxy&quot; and &quot;heresy&quot;. Hence in Christological and doctrinal reference &quot;mainstream Christianity&quot; is often equivalent to &quot;Trinitarianism&quot;. Mainline Protestantism should not be confused with Nicene Christianity which is more widely accepted as having the &quot;mainstream Christianity&quot; designation that also includes Catholics, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox believers, and non-Mainline Protestants such as Evangelical, Fundamentalist, Charismatic, Confessional, Confessing Movement, the historically Black church, and Global South Protestants. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term &quot;mainline Protestant&quot; is not used, and &quot;mainstream&quot; does not mean &quot;progressive&quot; Protestant. Although some supporters and adherents, do claim that Mainline Protestant is synonymous with Mainstream Protestant.

==Denominations==

The largest mainline churches are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Seven Sisters of American Protestantism,&quot; a term apparently coined by William Hutchison. The &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; are:
* United Methodist Church (UMC) is the largest mainline Protestant denomination among the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; with 5.4 million members in the United States in 2022.
* Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is the second largest mainline denomination with approximately 2.8 million members and 8,500 congregations at the end of 2023.
* Episcopal Church (TEC) is third largest, with 1.6 million active baptized members, of whom 1.4 million members are located in the United States in 2022.
* Presbyterian Church (USA) (PC-USA) is the fourth largest mainline denomination, with 1.1 million active members in 8,700 congregations (2021).
* American Baptist Churches USA (ABC-USA) is fifth in size, with approximately 1.1 million members (2017).
* United Church of Christ (UCC) is the sixth and has about 710,000 members in 2022.
* Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) (DOC) is the seventh and has about 278,000 members as of 2022.

The term &#x27;mainline&#x27; has also been applied to Canadian Protestant churches that share common origins with their US counterparts such as the:
* United Church of Canada 325,315 members (2023), 1.2 million adherents according to 2021 Canadian Census
* Anglican Church of Canada 294,931 members (2022), 1.1 million adherents according to 2021 Canadian Census
* Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada 111,570 members (2015)
* Canadian Baptist Ministries 81,685 members
* Presbyterian Church in Canada 79,961 members (2019)
* Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in Canada 2,606 members

The Association of Religion Data Archives, Pew Research, and other sources also consider these denominations, listed with adherents and members, to be mainline:
* Cooperative Baptist Fellowship 700,000 members
* Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) 350,000 members
* Reformed Church in America 104,921 members (2022)
* Mennonite Church USA 100,000 members
* Church of the Brethren 87,181 members (2021)
* International Council of Community Churches 69,276 members (2009)
* National Association of Congregational Christian Churches 65,392 members (2002)*
* Alliance of Baptists 65,000 members
* Moravian Church in North America 60,000 members
* Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches 15,666 members (2006)
* Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America 12,000 members (2007)
* Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church Abroad 8,000 members
* Hungarian Reformed Church in America 6,080 members
These same sources also consider &quot;Mainline&quot; other denominations outside the US, including:
* Anglican Church of Mexico 100,000 members
* Mennonite Church Canada 31,000 members
* The term is also occasionally used to refer to historic Protestant churches in Europe, Latin America, and South Africa.

Historically African American denominations are usually categorized differently from evangelicals or mainline. However, in 2014 the &quot;Christian Century&quot; identified that these groups &quot;fit the mainline description.&quot;
* African Methodist Episcopal Church 2.5 million
* African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church 1.4 million
* Christian Methodist Episcopal Church 858,670 members

Though not listed as mainline in either the Association of Religion Data Archives or the Pew Research classifications, two groups also appeal to this label. 
* The practices of the Community of Christ (Latter Day Saint movement) [with 250,000 adherentes]) are typified as congruent with mainline Protestantism.
* While no longer exclusively Christian, the Unitarian Universalist Association [with 211,000 adherents] considers itself to be mainline.

Some denominations with similar names and historical ties to the Seven Sisters mainline groups are not considered mainline: The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) [13.2 million], Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) [1.8 million], the Churches of Christ and Christian churches [1.1 million each], the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) [0.4 million], the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) [0.13 million], and the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference (CCCC) [0.04 million]. After the recent split of the UMC, the Global Methodist Church (GMC) could be added to this list, though no official census is currently known. Since these groups are too theologically conservative to be considered mainline, those strictly adhering to historical rules of faith are grouped as confessional, while those without are grouped as evangelical.

*The National Association of Congregational Christian Churches is considered to be evangelical by Pew Research while the Association of Religion Data Archives considered it to be mainline.

==Theology==
===Variation===

Mainline Protestantism is characterized by theological and ideological pluralism. While doctrinal standards and confessional statements exist, these are not usually interpreted in ways to exclude people from membership. Richard Hutcheson Jr., chairman of the Office of Review and Evaluation of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, observed that clergy candidates were more likely to be rejected due to &quot;excessive narrowness&quot; than for violating confessional standards.

Mainline churches hold a range of theological orientations—conservative, moderate and liberal. About half of mainline Protestants describe themselves as liberal. Mainline Christian groups are often more accepting of other beliefs and faiths, affirm the ordination of women, and have become increasingly affirming of gay ordination. A 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that 56% of mainline Protestants believe that non-Christians, including agnostics and atheists, can go to heaven, compared to around a fifth of evangelical Protestants and 38% of those who attend historically Black churches. Nearly one-third of mainline Protestants call themselves conservative, and most local mainline congregations have a strong, active conservative element. Mainline denominations are historically Trinitarian and proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and Son of God.

In practice, mainline churches tend to be theologically moderate and influenced by &quot;higher criticism,&quot; an approach used by scholars to separate the Bible&#x27;s earliest historical elements from perceived later additions and intentional distortions. Mainline denominations generally teach that the Bible is God&#x27;s Word in function, but that it must be interpreted both through the lens of the cultures in which it was originally written, and examined using God-given reason. A 2008 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that only 22 percent of the 7,500 mainline Christians surveyed said the Bible is God&#x27;s Word and is to be interpreted as literally true, word for word. Thirty-eight percent thought that the Bible is God&#x27;s Word but is not to be taken literally, word for word. Twenty-eight percent said the Bible was not the Word of God but was of human origin.

It has been noted, even by members of mainline churches, that the leadership of denominational agencies and bureaucracies has often been more theologically and socially liberal than the overall membership of the mainline churches. This gap has caused feelings of alienation among conservative mainline Protestants. This dissatisfaction has led to the formation of various Confessing Movements or charismatic renewal movements which are more conservative in tone.

===Social justice===
The mainline denominations emphasize the biblical concept of justice, stressing the need for Christians to work for social justice, which usually involve politically liberal approaches to social and economic problems. Early in the 20th century, they actively supported the Social Gospel.

Mainline churches were basically pacifistic before 1940, but under the influence of people such as Reinhold Niebuhr they supported World War II and the Cold War. They have been far from uniform in their reaction to issues of gender and sexuality, though they tend to be more accepting than the Catholic Church or the more conservative Protestant churches.

==Social issues==

Many mainline denominations are active in voicing perspectives on social issues. Almost all mainline denominations are gender-inclusive and ordain women. On abortion issues, the Episcopal Church (TEC), Presbyterian Church (USA) (PCUSA), Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA), and United Church of Christ (UCC) are members of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. The United Methodist Church (UMC) and Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) support exceptions, when abortion may be necessary, but do not endorse the procedure. Other denominations, such as the Church of the Brethren and Mennonite Church USA, are against abortion.

Regarding human sexuality, TEC, the ELCA, PC(USA), Society of Friends (Quaker), UUA, and UCC recognize same-sex marriages. Also considered mainline, the Anglican Church of Canada, Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and United Church of Canada bless or marry same-sex couples. In 2015, the Mennonite Church Canada saw its first same-sex marriage in one of its congregations. The American Baptist Churches USA does not perform same-gender marriages, but allows each congregation the freedom to decide for itself. Including the aforementioned denominations, the Mennonite Church USA, Metropolitan Community Church, and Moravian Church Northern Province license or ordain openly gay clergy. While the UMC does not nationally ordain gay or lesbian clergy, the New York Annual Conference, a regional body of the UMC, has ordained the denomination&#x27;s first openly gay and lesbian clergy. The Western Jurisdiction of the UMC also elected the denomination&#x27;s first openly gay bishop. Some congregations of the Church of the Brethren have also voted to perform same-gender marriages although the national denomination opposes this practice.

Most of the above denominations also ordain openly transgender clergy. While the national church has not approved of gay or lesbian clergy, the UMC has allowed transgender pastors.

Politically, mainline churches are also active. While no particular candidate can be endorsed, mainline churches often invite political speakers. At the 2016 General Conference for the African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historically Black denomination but also identified as mainline, Hillary Clinton was invited to offer an address for the delegates and clergy.

==Statistical decline==
The term &quot;mainline&quot; once implied a certain numerical majority or dominant presence in mainstream society, but that is no longer the case. Protestant churches as a whole have slowly declined in total membership since the 1960s. As the national population has grown these churches have shrunk from 63% of the population in 1970 to 54% by 2000, and 48% in 2012, ceasing to be the religious category for the majority of Americans. This statistic may be inaccurate due to the number of former or historically mainline Protestants who continue to espouse mainline Protestant values without active church attendance. American affiliation with mainline denominations declined from 55% of all Protestants in 1973 to 46% in 1998. The number of mainline congregations in the U. S. declined from more than 80,000 churches in the 1950s to about 72,000 in 2008. Robert Drinan estimated that there may have been a hundred million Mainline Protestants at one time in the United States.

Various causes of mainline decline in population have been cited. Much analysis has taken place both from those within and outside mainline denominations. Key factors indicate that all types of churches can and do grow, regardless of hymnody or contemporary music, type of liturgy, average age of worshiper, or location On average, however, churches in rural areas, churches with older congregants, and churches with fewer young people involved struggle most to add members and grow churches. For example, of all churches founded since 1993, 54% are experiencing growth, while that is true for only 28% of congregations founded prior to 1900. As demographics change, the churches founded by earlier generations often struggle to adapt to changing conditions, including the declines or shifts in the age and ethnicity of local populations. Says David Roozen, Director of Hartford Seminary&#x27;s Hartford Institute for Religion Research, &quot;Location, Location, Location used to be the kind way that researchers described the extent to which the growth or decline of American congregations was captive to the demographic changes going on in their immediate neighborhoods.&quot; Age demographics cannot be overlooked as a real factor in congregational decline, with the birthrate for mainline Protestants well below what is needed to maintain membership numbers.

The Barna Group, an Evangelical surveyor, has noted, Protestant pastors who serve mainline churches serve on average half as long as Protestant pastors in non-mainline churches. This may contribute to decline and may be influenced in part by the United Methodist Church practice of Itinerancy, where clergy are intentionally moved from one church to another as often as yearly in an effort to support and encourage the United Methodist tradition of strong lay ministry. Mainline churches have also had difficulty attracting minorities, particularly Hispanics. Hispanics comprise 6 percent of the mainline population but 16 percent of the US population. According to the Barna Group report, the failure of mainline Protestants to add substantial numbers of Hispanics is portent for the future, given both the rapid increase of the Hispanic population as well as the outflow of Hispanics from Catholicism to Protestant churches in the past decade, most of whom are selecting evangelical or Pentecostal Protestant churches.

In general, however, decline can be a difficult thing to statistically quantify. Many older Protestant churches lived a vibrant lifetime and continue to evidence vital ministry and faith regardless of declining populations or birthrates. For example, giving and engagement with need and justice, both indicators of strong Christian faith, have increased despite the aging and loss of congregational members.

===Contrast with other Protestant denominations===
While various Protestant denominations have experienced declining membership, the most pronounced changes have occurred among mainline churches. Demographic trends for evangelical and historically African-American churches have been more stable. According to the Pew Research Center, mainline churches could claim 14.7 percent of all US adults compared to 25.4 percent who belonged to evangelical churches in 2014.

Demographers Hout, Greeley, and Wilde have attributed the long-term decline in mainline membership and the concomitant growth in the conservative Protestant denominations to four basic causes: birth rates; switching to conservative denominations; departure from Protestantism to &quot;no religion&quot; (i.e. secularization); and conversions from non-Protestant sources. In their analysis, by far the main cause is birth rates—low for the mainline bodies, and high for the conservatives. The second most important factor is that fewer conservatives switch to mainline denominations than before. Despite speculation to the contrary, Hout, Greeley, and Wilde argue that switching from a mainline to a conservative denomination is not important in accounting for the trend, because it is fairly constant over the decades. Finally, conservative denominations have had a greater inflow of converts. Their analysis gives no support for the notion that theological or social conservatism or liberalism has much impact on long-term growth trends.

Evidence from the General Social Survey indicates that higher fertility and earlier childbearing among women from conservative denominations explains 76% of the observed trend: conservative denominations have grown their own. Mainline denomination members have the lowest birthrate among American Christian groups. Unless there is a surge of new members, rising death rates are predicted to diminish their ranks even further in the years ahead.

====Trends====
Some other findings of the Barna Group:
* From 1958 to 2008, mainline church membership dropped by more than one-quarter to roughly 20 million people—15 percent of all American adults.
* From 1998 to 2008, there was a 22 percent drop in the percentage of adults attending mainline congregations who have children under the age of 18 living in their home.
* In 2009, nearly 40 percent of mainline church attendees were single. This increase has been driven higher by a rise in the number of divorced and widowed adherents.
* From 1998 to 2008, volunteerism dropped 21 percent; adult Sunday school participation decreased 17 percent.
* The average age of a mainline pastor in 1998 was 48 and increased to 55 by 2009.
* Pastors on average remain with a congregation for four years compared to twice that length for non-mainline church leaders.

Recent statistics from the Pew Forum provide additional explanations for the decline.
* Evangelical church members are younger than those in mainline denominations. Fourteen percent of evangelical congregations are between 18 and 29 (compared to 2 percent), 36 percent between 30 and 49, 28 percent between 50 and 64, and 23 percent 65 or older.

Not paralleling the decline in membership is the household income of members of mainline denominations. Overall, it is higher than that of evangelicals:
* 25% reported less than a $30,000 income per year.
* 21% reported $30,000–$49,999 per year.
* 18% reported $50,000–$74,999 per year.
* 15% reported $75,000–$99,999 per year.
* 21% reported an income of $100,000 per year or more, compared to only 13 percent of evangelicals.

==History==
While the term &quot;mainline&quot; was not applied to churches until the 20th century, mainline churches trace their history to the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. The largest and most influential Protestant denominations in Britain&#x27;s Thirteen Colonies were the Anglicans (after the American Revolution called Episcopalians) and the Congregationalists (from which the Unitarians would later split). These were later surpassed in size and influence by the evangelical denominations: the Baptists, Presbyterians and Methodists. Sharing a common Reformation heritage with Episcopal and Congregational churches, these denominations together created the mainline. It was, according to historian Jason Lantzer, &quot;the emerging evangelical movement that would help forge the Seven Sisters and which provides a core to the wide variety of theological and doctrinal differences, shaping them into a more coherent whole.&quot;

The Great Awakening ignited controversy within Protestant churches between Old Lights and New Lights (or Old Side and New Side among Presbyterians). Led by figures such as the Congregationalist minister Charles Chauncy, Old Lights opposed the evangelical revivalism at the heart of the Awakening, while New Lights, led by fellow Congregationalist minister Jonathan Edwards, supported the revivals and argued for the importance of having a conversion experience. By the 1800s, Chauncy&#x27;s followers had drifted toward forms of theological liberalism, such as Universalism, Unitarianism and Transcendentalism.

The Second Great Awakening would inaugurate a period of evangelical dominance within American mainline Protestantism that would last over a century. The Second Great Awakening was a catalyst for the reform of society. Efforts to improve the rights of women, reforming prisons, establishing free public schools, prohibiting alcohol, and (in the North) abolishing slavery were promoted by mainline churches.

After the Civil War, however, tensions between evangelicals and non-evangelicals would re-emerge. As the practice of historical criticism spread to the United States, conflict over biblical inspiration erupted within Protestant churches. Conservative Protestants led by A. A. Hodge, B. B. Warfield and other Princeton theologians argued for biblical inerrancy, while liberal theologians such as Charles A. Briggs of Union Theological Seminary were open to using historical criticism to understand the Bible.

As 19th–century evangelicals embraced dispensational premillennialism and retreated from society in the face of mounting social problems caused by industrialization, urbanization and immigration, liberal Protestants embraced the Social Gospel, which worked for the &quot;regeneration of society&quot; rather than only the conversion of individuals.

The Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s widened the division between evangelical and non-evangelical Protestants as the two sides fought for control over the mainline denominations. The fundamentalists lost these battles for control to the modernists or liberals. Since the 1920s, mainline churches have been associated with liberal Protestantism.

Episcopalians and Presbyterian WASPs tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups in America, and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business, law and politics, and for many years were especially dominant in the Republican Party. Numbers of the wealthiest and most affluent American families, such as the Vanderbilts and Astors, Rockefeller, who were Baptists, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Fords, Mellons, Whitneys, the Morgans and Harrimans are Episcopalian and Presbyterian families.

Through the 1940s and 1950s, neo-orthodoxy had become the prevailing theological approach within the mainline churches. This neo-orthodox consensus, however, gave way to resurgent liberal theologies in the 1960s and to liberation theology during the 1970s.

=== Recent history ===
Mainline Protestants were a majority of Protestants in the United States until the mid-20th century. A dip in membership across all Christian denominations was more pronounced among mainline groups, with the result that mainline groups no longer comprise the majority. In 2020, Public Religion Research Institute conducted a religious census, based on self-identification, finding that an estimated 16% of U.S. Americans identified as non-Hispanic white mainline Protestants, slightly outnumbering non-Hispanic white evangelical Protestants who were 14% of the American population. In 2014, Pew Research completed and published the &quot;Religious Landscape Survey&quot; in which it was estimated that 14.7% of Americans identified as mainline Protestant, excluding historically Black and African American denominations, while 25.4% identified as evangelical Protestants, also excluding membership in historically Black denominations.

Mainline churches share an active approach to social issues that often leads to cooperation in organizations such as the National Council of Churches. Because of their involvement with the ecumenical movement, mainline churches are sometimes (especially outside the United States) given the alternative label of ecumenical Protestantism. These churches played a leading role in the Social Gospel movement and were active in social causes such as the civil rights movement and the women&#x27;s movement. As a group, the mainline churches have maintained religious doctrine that stresses social justice and personal salvation. Members of mainline denominations have played leadership roles in politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They were involved in the founding of leading institutes of higher education. Marsden argues that in the 1950s, &quot;Mainline Protestant leaders were part of the liberal-moderate cultural mainstream, and their leading spokespersons were respected participants in the national conversation.&quot;

Some mainline Protestant denominations have the highest proportion of graduate and post-graduate degrees of any other denomination in the United States. Some also include the highest proportion of those with some college education, such as the Episcopal Church (76%), the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (64%), and the United Church of Christ (46%), as well as most of the American upper class. compared with the nationwide average of 50%. Episcopalians and Presbyterians also tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups, and they were disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of US business and law until the 1950s.

In the 1990s four of the US Supreme Court Justices were Mainline Protestants: Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, John Paul Stevens, William Rehnquist and David Souter.

From 1854 until at least 1964, Mainline Protestants and their descendants were heavily Republican. In recent decades, Republicans slightly outnumber Democrats.

From 1965 to 1988, mainline church membership declined from 31 million to 25 million, then fell to 21 million in 2005. While in 1970 the mainline churches claimed most Protestants and more than 30 percent of the population as members, today they are a minority among Protestants; in 2009, only 15 percent of Americans were adherents. A Pew Forum statistic revealed the same share in 2014.

<text>The jungle myna (Acridotheres fuscus) is a myna, a member of the starling family. It is found patchily distributed across much of the mainland of the Indian Subcontinent but absent in the arid zones of India. It is easily recognized by the tuft of feathers on its forehead that form a frontal crest, a feature also found in the closely related Javan myna and the pale-bellied myna which were treated as a subspecies in the past. The eyes are pale, yellow or blue depending on the population and the base of the orange-yellow bill is dark. It has also been introduced either intentionally or accidentally into many other parts of the world including Fiji, Taiwan, the Andaman Islands, and parts of Japan. The species has also spread out on its own to some islands in the Pacific.

==Description==

Jungle mynas are long and have grey plumage, darker on the head and wings. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage. A large white wing patches on the base of the primaries becomes conspicuous in flight, and the tail feathers are broadly tipped in white. There is a tuft of feathers on the forehead arising at the base of the bill. The bill and legs are bright yellow, and there is no bare skin around eye as in the common myna and the bank myna. The base of the beak is dark in adults with a shade of blue at the base of the lower mandible. The southern Indian population has a blue iris. The northeastern Indian populations have a smoky dark belly and vent. Juveniles are browner with a pale throat and along the median of the underside.

Abnormal leucistic plumages have been recorded.

The calls of the jungle myna are higher pitched than those of the common myna. Foraging flocks make clipped cheeping contact calls.

The jungle myna is part of the &quot;Acridotheres&quot; clade which is thought to have speciated in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene Periods. Unlike the starlings in the genus &quot;Sturnus&quot;, they do not have well-developed adaptations including the musculature required for prying or open bill probing (which need muscles to open the beak apart forcefully). The nominate population &quot;A. f. fuscus&quot; was described from Bengal by Wagler as &quot;Pastor fuscus&quot; in 1827. It has a pale creamy vent. This population with a yellow iris extends south of the Brahmaputra into Burma and the Malay Peninsula. &quot;A. f. fumidus&quot; of eastern India, mainly east of the Brahmaputra in Assam and Nagaland (although movements are known), was described by Sidney Dillon Ripley in 1950, although he placed it as a subspecies of &quot;cristatellus&quot; based on the prevailing treatment of the time. It has a darker smoky grey vent and can appear similar to the syntopic great myna, but the latter is darker and does not have a pale iris.. The peninsular Indian population &quot;mahrattensis&quot; described by W.H. Sykes in 1832 is identifiable by the blue iris. The population in the Malay Peninsula, &quot;torquatus&quot;, was described by W.R. Davison in 1892. It has a white throat and a half-collar extending around the neck. The species has a diploid chromosome number of 74 (80 in the common myna).

==Distribution and habitat==

The jungle myna is a common resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from Nepal, Bangladesh, India. Subspecies &quot;fuscus&quot; is found across northern India west from Mount Abu, east to Puri in Orissa. It has also been introduced into the Andaman Islands and Fiji where it was introduced around 1890 to control insect pests in sugarcane. They have expanded on their own into some Pacific Islands such as Niuafo&#x27;ou where they are a threat to native bird species such as lories (&quot;Vini&quot;) with whom they compete especially for nest holes. In many parts of Asia, they are kept as pets and feral populations have established in many places such as in Taiwan. Breeding populations have established in Japan and Western Samoa. The population &quot;torquatus&quot; of Malaysia is on the decline and is possibly being outcompeted by Javan mynas with which it form hybrids.

This common passerine is typically found in forest and cultivation and often close to open water. They may disperse outside their range particularly after the breeding season.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Jungle mynas are omnivorous feed mainly on insects, fruit and seeds, for which they forage mainly on the ground often in the company of other myna species. They also take berries from low bushes such as &quot;Lantana&quot; and take nectar from large flowers borne on trees such as &quot;Erythrina&quot; (which they may also pollinate with their tuft feathers acting as brushes) and water collected in the flowers of introduced trees such &quot;Spathodea campanulata&quot;. They also perch on large grazing mammals, picking ectoparasites off their bodies, and capturing insects that may be disturbed into flight from vegetation. Flocks may also follow farmers in fields that are being ploughed. They also forage on kitchen waste in urban areas. They may take larger prey including small mice to feed their young. In Fiji, they have been noticed anting using a millipede.

The breeding season is in summer and before the rains, February to May in southern India and April to July in northern India. They are secondary cavity nesters, using both holes in trees and in man-made constructions such as walls, embankments, and in houses from 2 to 6 metres above the ground. As secondary tree hole nesters, they compete with other hole-nesters. They have also been recorded using the axils of fronds of palm trees in Malaysia. They sometimes use sloughed snake skins to line the inside of the nest hole. In the Himalayan foothills, they use dry pine needles to line the nest. The usual clutch consists of 4 to 6 turquoise blue eggs. Both sexes take part in nest building, incubation and feeding the young.

They roost communally along with other mynas, sometimes in sugarcane fields and reed beds.

Species of &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; are known from the blood of mynas and they have also been found to host &quot;Plasmodium circumflexum&quot; when artificially infected in the lab. Other parasites that have been found in the jungle myna include &quot;Dorisa aethiopsaris&quot; in the intestine.

<text>Isigny-sur-Mer (, literally &quot;Isigny on Sea&quot;) is a commune in the Calvados department and Normandy region of north-western France.

It is part of the communauté de communes Isigny-Omaha Intercom, the 59 communes of which have a combined population of 27,181.

==Geography and economy==
Situated in the fertile grassland region – known as the Baie des Veys – which constitutes the joint estuary of four rivers, Isigny is an important centre of the dairy industry. The town is famous for its AOC butter and cream, as well as for the production of Mimolette, Pont-l&#x27;Évêque, Camembert, and Trésor d&#x27;Isigny cheeses, among others, made by the Isigny Sainte-Mère co-operative. Oysters have been extensively cultivated in the nearby waters of the Baie des Veys since the mid 20th century. A major river, the Vire, passes through the commune.

==History==
The name of the town is proposed to have derived from Latin &quot;Isiniacum&quot;, based on Germanic name &quot;Iso&quot; and Latin ending -iacum.

The town is well positioned and owes its significance to its industrial history. The industrialisation of milk processing began at the start of the 19th century: many factories were built, especially by the Dupont d&#x27;Isigny family, which then diversified and created the famous Isigny caramels. More recently, the co-operative Isigny dairy has dominated. Meanwhile, the agricultural fairs and markets have also contributed to Isigny&#x27;s reputation.

The d&#x27;Isigny family traces back to before the Norman conquest of England, and William The Conqueror (1028–82) had military commanders named d&#x27;Isigny. In 1924, Isigny was renamed Isigny-sur-Mer.

The port was important in facilitating inshore navigation, allowing commercial and industrial activity to be developed and maintained (import of wood from the North; export coal from the mine at Littry and butter). Fishing was important until the end of the 1970s (mussel fishing and small vessels crewed by fishermen from the Hogues quarter). The famous &quot;Caïeu d&#x27;Isigny&quot; is a hymn to Isigny&#x27;s sailors and fishermen, created in 1869 by Alfred Rossel (1841–1926).

Isigny was more than 60% destroyed by two bombardments on 8 June 1944 and has since been almost entirely rebuilt. Isigny played its part in the D-Day landings: Twenty small Dutch schuyts were employed by the Americans to bring stores and equipment inland from the larger cargo ships that were moored off-shore. Charles de Gaulle paid its inhabitants visits on 14 June 1944 and 16 June 1946.

The Disney surname is derived from the town. The earliest known ancestor of Walt Disney, with a similar name, was Jean-Christophe d&#x27;Isigny (&quot;of Isigny&quot;), the branch settled in what is today called Norton Disney in England.

On 1 January 2017, the commune was extended by being merged with the former communes of Castilly, Neuilly-la-Forêt, Les Oubeaux, and Vouilly. Until 2015, Isigny-sur-Mer was the seat of the canton of Isigny-sur-Mer, which included 24 communes and had a population of 9,935.

==Population==
== Economy ==

Isigny is famous for local products made from milk, such as butter and cream and caramels. Several agro-food companies manufacture these products, including Isigny-Sainte-Mère (butter and cream) and Dupont d&#x27;Isigny (caramels).

==International relations==
The commune is twinned with Weilerbach, .

A twinning arrangement with Kingsbridge in Devon, England, ended in 2019 after 58 years.

<text>Raoul Walsh (born Albert Edward Walsh; March 11, 1887December 31, 1980) was an American film director, actor, founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), and the brother of silent cinema actor George Walsh. He was known for portraying John Wilkes Booth in the silent film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915) and for directing such films as the widescreen epic &quot;The Big Trail&quot; (1930) starring John Wayne in his first leading role, &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; starring James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941) starring Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart, and &quot;White Heat&quot; (1949) starring James Cagney and Edmond O&#x27;Brien. He directed his last film in 1964. His work has been noted as influences on directors such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Jack Hill, and Martin Scorsese.

==Biography==
Walsh was born in New York as Albert Edward Walsh to Elizabeth T. Bruff, the daughter of Irish Catholic immigrants, and Thomas W. Walsh, an Englishman. Walsh was part of Omega Gamma Delta in high school, as was his younger brother. Growing up in New York, Walsh was also a friend of the Barrymore family. John Barrymore recalled spending time reading in the Walsh family library as a youth. After his mother died, he left home when he was fifteen years old and traveled through Texas, Montana and Cuba, also working in Mexico as a cowboy. Later in life, Walsh lived in Palm Springs, California. He was buried at Assumption Cemetery Simi Valley, Ventura County, California.

===Film career===
Walsh was educated at Seton Hall College. He began acting in 1909, first as a stage actor in New York City and later as a film actor. In 1913 he changed his name to Raoul Walsh. In 1914 he became an assistant to D. W. Griffith and made his first full-length feature film as an actor, &quot;The Life of General Villa&quot;, shot on location in Mexico with Pancho Villa playing the lead, and with actual ongoing battles filmed in progress as well as battle recreations. Walsh played Villa as a younger man. Walsh played John Wilkes Booth in Griffith&#x27;s epic &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915) and also served as an assistant director. This movie was followed by the critically acclaimed &quot;Regeneration&quot; in 1915, the earliest feature gangster film, shot on location in Manhattan&#x27;s Bowery district.

Walsh served as an officer in the United States Army during World War I. He later directed &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1924), starring Douglas Fairbanks and Anna May Wong, and Laurence Stallings&#x27; &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; (1926), starring Victor McLaglen and Dolores del Río.
In &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; (1928), starring Gloria Swanson as a prostitute seeking a new life in Samoa, Walsh starred as Swanson&#x27;s boyfriend in his first acting role since 1915; he also directed the film. He was then hired to direct and star in &quot;In Old Arizona&quot;, a film about O. Henry&#x27;s character the Cisco Kid. While on location for that film Walsh was in a car crash when a jackrabbit jumped through the windshield as he was driving through the desert; he lost his right eye as a result. He gave up the part and never acted again. Warner Baxter won an Oscar for the role Walsh was originally slated to play. Walsh would wear an eyepatch for the rest of his life.

In the early days of sound with Fox, Walsh directed the first widescreen spectacle, &quot;The Big Trail&quot; (1930), an epic wagon train western shot on location, across the West. The movie starred John Wayne, then unknown, whom Walsh discovered as prop man named Marion Morrison, and he was renamed after the Revolutionary War general Mad Anthony Wayne; Walsh happened to be reading a book about him at the time. Walsh directed &quot;The Bowery&quot; (1933), featuring Wallace Beery, George Raft, Fay Wray and Pert Kelton; the energetic movie recounts the story of Steve Brodie (Raft), supposedly the first man to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge and live to brag about it.

An undistinguished period followed with Paramount Pictures from 1935 to 1939, but Walsh&#x27;s career rose to new heights after he moved to Warner Brothers, with &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; (1939), featuring James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart; &quot;Dark Command&quot; (1940), with John Wayne and Roy Rogers (at Republic Pictures); &quot;They Drive By Night&quot; (1940), with George Raft, Ann Sheridan, Ida Lupino and Bogart; &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), with Lupino and Bogart again; &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; (1941), with Errol Flynn as Custer; &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot; (1941), with Cagney and Olivia de Havilland; &quot;Manpower&quot; (1941), with Edward G. Robinson, Marlene Dietrich and George Raft; and &quot;White Heat&quot; (1949), with Cagney. Walsh&#x27;s contract at Warners expired in 1953.

He directed several films afterwards, including three with Clark Gable: &quot;The Tall Men&quot; (1955), &quot;The King and Four Queens&quot; (1956) and &quot;Band of Angels&quot; (1957). Walsh retired in 1964. He died of a heart attack in 1980.

==Outside interests==
Raoul Walsh was a breeder and owner of Thoroughbred racehorses. For a time, his brother George Walsh trained his stable of horses. Their horse Sunset Trail competed in the 1937 Kentucky Derby won by War Admiral who went on to win the U.S. Triple Crown. Sunset Trail finished sixteenth in a field of twenty runners.

Some of Walsh&#x27;s film-related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives.

<doc id="640921" wikidata="Q2344152" url="?curid=640921" title="Earl of Sunderland">
<text>Earl of Sunderland is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England. The first creation came in 1627 in favour of Emanuel Scrope, 11th Baron Scrope of Bolton. The earldom became extinct upon his death in 1630, while the barony became either extinct or dormant (see Baron Scrope of Bolton for more information on this title). The second creation came in 1643 in favour of the Royalist soldier Henry Spencer, 3rd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton.

==History==
The Spencer family descended from Sir John Spencer (d. 1522), who acquired the Wormleighton estate in Warwickshire and the Althorp estate in Northamptonshire. His grandson Sir John Spencer (d. 1586) was a Knight of the Shire for Northamptonshire. The latter&#x27;s grandson Sir Robert Spencer represented Brackley in Parliament during the late 16th century. In 1603, Sir Robert was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Spencer of Wormleighton. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, William, the second Baron. He had previously represented Northamptonshire in Parliament. His eldest son was the aforementioned third Baron. In July 1643, he was created Earl of Sunderland in the Peerage of England, but he was killed at the Battle of Newbury in September of the same year. He was succeeded by his two-year-old only son, Robert, the second Earl. He later gained great distinction as a statesman and notably served four times as Secretary of State for the Southern Department.

His eldest surviving son, Charles, the third Earl, also gained prominence as a statesman. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Privy Seal, Secretary of State for both the Northern and Southern Departments, Lord President of the Council and First Lord of the Treasury. However, his political career was ruined by the South Sea Bubble of 1720. Lord Sunderland married (as his second wife) Lady Anne Churchill, second daughter of the distinguished soldier John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and Sarah Jennings. The dukedom of Marlborough was allowed to descend to the Duke&#x27;s daughters and their sons after a special Act of Parliament was passed in 1716.

The third Earl was succeeded by his eldest surviving son (by his second wife), Robert, the fourth Earl. He died unmarried in 1729 at the age of 27 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Charles, the fifth Earl. In 1733, he succeeded his maternal aunt, Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, as third Duke of Marlborough. The barony of Spencer of Wormleighton and earldom of Sunderland have remained subsidiary titles of the dukedom ever since. Earl of Sunderland has been used as the courtesy title of the Duke&#x27;s eldest male-line grandson.

John Spencer, fourth son of the third Earl of Sunderland by his second wife, succeeded to the family estates in Northamptonshire in 1733 after his elder brother inherited the dukedom of Marlborough. His son John was created Earl Spencer in 1765. Robert Spencer, second son of the second Baron, had been created Viscount Teviot in 1685.

<text>Continuously variable slope delta modulation (CVSD or CVSDM) is a voice coding method. It is a delta modulation with variable step size (i.e., special case of adaptive delta modulation), first proposed by Greefkes and Riemens in 1970.

CVSD encodes at 1 bit per sample, so that audio sampled at 16 kHz is encoded at 16 kbit/s.

The encoder maintains a reference sample and a step size. Each input sample is compared to the reference sample. If the input sample is larger, the encoder emits a &quot;1&quot; bit and adds the step size to the reference sample. If the input sample is smaller, the encoder emits a &quot;0&quot; bit and subtracts the step size from the reference sample. The encoder also keeps the previous &quot;N&quot; bits of output (&quot;N&quot; = 3 or &quot;N&quot; = 4 are very common) to determine adjustments to the step size; if the previous &quot;N&quot; bits are all 1s or 0s, the step size is increased. Otherwise, the step size is decreased (usually in an exponential manner, with formula_1 being in the range of 5 ms). The step size is adjusted for every input sample processed.

To allow for bit errors to fade out and to allow (re)synchronization to an ongoing bitstream, the output register (which keeps the reference sample) is normally realized as a leaky integrator with a time constant (formula_1) of about 1 ms.

The decoder reverses this process, starting with the reference sample, and adding or subtracting the step size according to the bit stream. The sequence of adjusted reference samples are the reconstructed waveform, and the step size is adjusted according to the same all-1s-or-0s logic as in the encoder.

Adaptation of step size allows one to avoid slope overload (step of quantization increases when the signal rapidly changes) and decreases granular noise when the signal is constant (decrease of step of quantisation).

CVSD is sometimes called a compromise between simplicity, low bitrate, and quality. Common bitrates are 9.6–128 kbit/s.

Like other delta-modulation techniques, the output of the decoder does not exactly match the original input to the encoder.

== Applications ==
12 kbit/s CVSD is used by Motorola&#x27;s SECURENET line of digitally encrypted two-way radio products. 

16 and 32 kbit/s CVSD were used by military TRI-TAC digital telephones (DNVT, DSVT) for use in deployed areas to provide voice recognition quality audio. 16 kbit/s rates were typically used by US Army forces to conserve bandwidth over tactical links. 32 kbit/s rates were typically used by US Air Force forces for improved voice quality.

64 kbit/s CVSD is one of the options to encode voice signals in telephony-related Bluetooth service profiles; e.g., between mobile phones and wireless headsets. The other options are PCM with logarithmic a-law or μ-law quantization, as well as mSBC codec featuring 16 kHz sample rate and best quality.

Numerous arcade games, such as &quot;Sinistar&quot; and &quot;Smash TV&quot;, and pinball machines, such as &quot;Gorgar&quot; or &quot;Space Shuttle&quot;, play pre-recorded speech through an HC-55516 CVSD decoder.

<doc id="640963" wikidata="Q157307" url="?curid=640963" title="Morus alba">
<text>Morus alba, known as white mulberry, common mulberry and silkworm mulberry, is a fast-growing, small to medium-sized mulberry tree which grows to tall. It is native to China and India and is widely cultivated and naturalized elsewhere.

The white mulberry is widely cultivated to feed the silkworms employed in the commercial production of silk. It is also notable for the rapid release of its pollen, which is launched at greater than half the speed of sound. Its berries are edible when ripe.

==Description==
The tree can grow to tall. It is generally a short-lived tree with a lifespan comparable to that of humans, although there are some specimens known to be more than 250 years old. Generally, the trees are deciduous in temperate regions, but trees grown in tropical regions may be evergreen. On young, vigorous shoots, the leaves may be up to long, and deeply and intricately lobed, with the lobes rounded. On mature trees, the leaves are generally long, unlobed, cordate at the base and rounded to acuminate at the tip, and serrated on the margins.

The flowers are single-sex catkins; male catkins are long, and female catkins long. Male and female flowers are usually found on separate trees although they may occur on the same tree. The fruit is long. In the wild it is deep purple, but in many cultivated plants it varies from white to pink. It is sweet but bland, unlike the more intense flavor of the red mulberry and black mulberry. The seeds are widely dispersed in the droppings of birds that eat the fruit.

The white mulberry is scientifically notable for the rapid plant movement involved in pollen release from its catkins. The stamens act as catapults, releasing stored elastic energy in just 25 μs. The resulting movement is approximately , about half the speed of sound, making it the fastest known movement in the plant kingdom.

== Taxonomy ==
Two varieties of &quot;Morus alba&quot; are recognized:
* &quot;Morus alba&quot; var. &quot;alba&quot;
* &quot;Morus alba&quot; var. &quot;multicaulis&quot;

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is native to China and India and is widely cultivated and naturalized elsewhere (including the United States, Mexico, Australia, Kyrgyzstan, Argentina, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and many others).

It is widely naturalized in disturbed areas such as roadsides and the edges of tree lots, along with urban areas in much of North America, where it hybridizes readily with the locally native red mulberry &quot;(Morus rubra)&quot;. There is now serious concern for the long-term genetic viability of the red mulberry because of extensive hybridization in some areas.

The species is now extensively planted and widely naturalized throughout the warm temperate world and in subarctic regions as well, and would survive in elevations as high as . They thrive in mildly acidic, well drained, sandy loam and clayey loam soils, though they can withstand poor soils as well.

== Cultivation ==
Mulberry cultivation is generally found in both tropical and temperate regions, although the temperature of 24-28 °C is ideal for cultivating mulberry. Mulberry thrives from 28 °N and 55 °N latitude under varying climatic conditions ranging from temperate and tropical situated north of the equator. It grows well in areas where annual rainfall varies between with a minimum of nine to 13 hours of sunshine per day. Mulberry can be grown up to above sea level. Mulberry blooms well in warm, rich, fertile, well-drained, loamy to clayey soils, porous with strong moisture-holding ability. The optimal soil pH range is 6.2–6.8. Because mulberry is a hardy crop, the soil moisture can be used to a greater extent by these plants. However, the analysis of India&#x27;s soils stated that the status of sodium (Na), potassium (K), and phosphorus (P) should be set. When some deviation occurs then the insects or fungi will attack mulberry plants.

Although the trees can be reproduced by seed, to maintain the proprieties of the mothertree, mulberry are usually reproduced by stem cutting, or sometimes by grafting. Depending on what the mulberry trees are used for, production of fodder, timber, leaves for silkworms or fruit, several cultivation systems are possible, such as hedges, trees or pollarded trees.

The tree is vigorous and characterized by good disease resistance, as many parts of the tree (bark, leaves, etc.) are rich in antimicriobial and antifungal compounds.

=== History ===

Cultivation of white mulberry to nourish silkworms began more than 4,700 years ago in China and has since been introduced in other countries. The Ancient Greeks and Romans cultivated the mulberry for silkworms. At least as early as 220 AD, Emperor Elagabalus wore a silk robe. It was introduced into other parts of Europe in the twelfth century and into Latin America after the Spanish conquest in the fifteenth century. In 2002, 6,260 km2 of land were devoted to the species in China.

It has been grown widely from the Indian subcontinent west through Afghanistan and Iran to southern Europe for more than a thousand years for leaves to feed silkworms.

==Toxicity==
Tests on laboratory rats have not found mulberry extract to present significant toxicity.

According to a coroner&#x27;s report, Lori McClintock, wife of US politician Tom McClintock, died in December 2021 from dehydration due to gastroenteritis caused by &quot;adverse effects of white mulberry leaf ingestion&quot;; the leaf is used as a dietary supplement or herbal remedy for weight loss and diabetes.

==Uses==
=== Leaves ===
White mulberry leaves are the preferred feedstock for silkworms (Bombyx mori), and sericulture was therefore one of the main reasons of the expansion of the cultivation of this tree. White mulberry are also cut to feed livestock (cattle, goats, etc.) because of its interesting proprieties. Mulberry could be an interesting alternative for fodder production as it is rich in protein and energy, and has a high degree of digestibility, in addition to being a fast and vigorous growing plant. Furthermore, the polyphenolic content of the leaves could have a positive impact on animals health and at the same time reducing their methane emissions.

The leaves are prepared as tea in Korea. In Asia leaves are also consumed for medical purposes, which are used as an anti-hyperglycemic supplement for diabetes patients. In traditional Chinese medicine, bark, leaves and the fruits are used to treat fever, lower blood pressure, protect liver damage, improve eyesight, and facilitate discharge of urine.

=== Fruits ===
The fruit are also interesting for human consumption. They can be eaten fresh, and they are appreciated for their sweet taste, but the fragile skin of the fruits makes storage and marketing difficult. Nevertheless, the fruit can be processed in several ways to ensure its preservation, such as dried, made into syrups, wines or spirits. For example, in Azerbaijan, where the mulberries are part of the culture, the fruits are transformed into a dense syrup called &quot;doshab&quot; or &quot;bakmaz&quot;; or transformed into a potent liqueur, called tTut araghi&quot;. In China the fruits are transformed into a paste called sangshengao, which is used to make tea.

=== Wood ===
In India, mulberry wood is used to make sports equipment, furniture, household utensils and agricultural implements.

=== Landscaping ===
For landscaping, a fruitless mulberry was developed from a clone for use in the production of silk in the U.S. The industry never materialized, but the mulberry variety is now used as an ornamental tree where shade is desired without the fruit. White mulberry, &quot;Morus alba&quot; &#x27;Pendula&#x27;, is used as an ornamental plant. It was planted at several grand stations built along the Lackawanna Railroad in New Jersey during the late 1800s and early 1900s. The species is a lawn tree across the desert cities of the southwestern United States, prized for its shade and also for its cylindrical berry clusters composed of sweet, purplish-white fruits. The plant&#x27;s pollen is problematic in some cities where it has been blamed for an increase in hay fever.

<doc id="640999" wikidata="Q839006" url="?curid=640999" title="Urban archaeology">
<text>Urban archaeology is a sub discipline of archaeology specializing in the material past of towns and cities where long-term human habitation has often left a rich record of the past. In modern times, when someone talks about living in a city, they are in an area with many surrounding people and buildings, generally quite tall ones. In archaeological terms, cities give great information because of the infrastructure they have and amounts of people that were around one another. Through the years there has been one big method used for urban archaeology along with significant historic developments.

Large concentrations of humans produce large concentrations of waste. Kitchen waste, broken objects, and similar material all need to be disposed of, while small numbers of people can dispose of their waste locally without encouraging vermin or endangering their health. Once people began to live together in large numbers, around five thousand years ago, such methods began to become impractical and material usually was brought into these new settlements but would rarely be taken out again.

Urban archaeology can be applied to the study of social, racial, and economic dynamics and history within contemporary and antiquated cities as well as the environmental impacts within these spaces.

Up until the nineteenth century when organized rubbish disposal became widespread in urban areas people invariably threw their waste from their windows or buried it in their gardens. If their houses fell down, a common enough occurrence when planning laws were non-existent, owners would pick out what they could reuse, stamp down the remains and rebuild on the old site. Archaeological excavations of urban sites are often categorized by these remains and as well as the former impacts of modern technology such as sanitation, commercial, or transportation services 

The effect of this is that even a moderately sized settlement of any antiquity is built on top of a heap of refuse and demolished buildings and is therefore raised up from its original height on a plateau of archaeology. This is most apparent in the tel sites of the Near East where towns that have been occupied for thousands of years are raised up many metres above the surrounding landscape.

In walled towns, such as those in medieval Europe, the effect of the encircling defenses was to hold in the waste so that it could not slip outwards, magnifying the effect.

Redevelopment and archaeological excavation is a part of modern urban life and public interest in urban archaeological work is often strong, yet developers can be cautious of unbridled dissemination of information that has the potential to ignite public opinion. Urban archaeology carries the opportunity for archaeologists to work with the public to illustrate the history and heritage of discoveries.

==Historic development==

Archaeological excavation within historic cities therefore often produces a thick stratigraphy dating back to the original foundation and telling the story of its history.

The City of London serves as an example, for urban excavations have been performed there since the late 1900s. These excavations, performed in populated areas of the city, revealed historical evidence of events unforeseen previously by historians. London sits on a tel, which preserves a layer of dark material, attributed to the burning of the city by Boudica in 60 AD. It was only by excavation of the urban areas that these revelations could be made, as the city has long since outgrown its borders after its rebuild, some years after the Boudican revolt.

Another good example is the City of Turku, founded in the Middle Ages in southwestern Finland, for which no reliable document has been preserved since its foundation; countless excavations have been carried out in the city each year in order to gain more clarity on the city’s birth history.

The dense stratigraphy of such cities posed problems for the archaeologists who first excavated them. Earlier excavations were generally limited to rural areas, or towns which had been long abandoned. Open area excavation was feasible as there was plenty of space and the archaeology could often be exposed just in plan. In working cities however, space for excavation is usually limited to the size of the open plot and one layer of archaeology needs to be excavated before the next one can be exposed.

Additionally, Rome was also a big archaeological site since it was considered well established and advanced over time. Many excavations have been done there and later studied by archaeologists. One archaeologist who spent great time studying Roman archaeology was W. F. Grimes.

Issues such as this had appeared before, at Pompeii or at multi-phase rural sites but the move towards the investigation of cities, which began in Europe following the Second World War. The trend of urban excavation in areas such as Europe, the East Coast of the United States, and other western world cities, has grown since the war. Due to the bombing of landscapes during the war, the possibility of losing evidence connected to early civilizations became realized. The idea of settlement follows a principle, that settlement is made where resources are conveniently accessed. Prosperous cities, such as Boston and London, began as settlements, and grew quickly due to the convenient access of resources. However, the fact that these cities still exist today does not dismiss the fact that, at some point in history, some other civilization had once settled there.

==Methods==

The resulting solution revolved around the method of single context recording. This method was started by Ed Harris and Patrick Ottaway in 1976 before being expanded upon by the Museum of London in the mid 1980s and transferred to the York Archaeological Trust. The practice involves drawing each feature individually in plan and then relating its position to the site grid rather than planning large areas at once. Each drawing is made on a square piece of translucent film representing a 5-metre x 5-metre grid square. The site is excavated down to the first significant layer of archaeology and features excavated and recorded as normal but also planned as single contexts. The site is then reduced to the next layer of archaeology and the process begins again. The excavation and recording can continue until natural deposits are reached. A small, deep trench known as a sondage is often excavated at first to provide a view of the entire stratigraphy at once and give an indication of the quantity of material to be excavated. Simply put, if someone does one plan per context than the method that are using is single context recording.

Once the work is finished, the square sheets can be overlaid onto one another to provide a picture of the site. By identifying which features cut others and using information from dateable artefacts and ecofacts an archaeologist can isolate various phases of activity and show how the use of the site developed of periods of hundreds or even thousands of years. Context record sheets produced by the individual excavators provide further information on each context&#x27;s nature and relationship with its neighbours. Such interpretation would be impossible using open area excavation where numerous overall site plans would soon seem inflexible.

==Notable urban archaeologists==

*W. F. Grimes: Archaeologist who spent extensive time studying London and Roman archaeology, specifically dating back to medieval times. He also wrote a book, which described his findings about London and Rome.
*Martin Biddle: He is a British archaeologist and professor who was the first lecturer in medieval archaeology in England. He is chairman of the Fabric Advisory Committee for Winchester Cathedral, Archaeological Consultant for St Albans Cathedral, and former Archaeological Consultant for Canterbury Cathedral.
*Martin Carver: He was a professor from the department of Archaeology at the University of York. Carver was active in pursuing new excavation methods and survey methods while studying early medieval Europe archaeology.
*Michael E. Smith: Smith is an archaeologist who had two primary focuses with his studies: Aztecs, Teotihuacan and ancient central Mexico societies along with comparative urbanism. He has also been the director of several fieldwork projects at different sites in the provinces of the Aztec empire in central Mexico.

<text>The Wadsworth Atheneum is an art museum in Hartford, Connecticut. The Wadsworth is noted for its collections of European Baroque art, ancient Egyptian and Classical bronzes, French and American Impressionist paintings, Hudson River School landscapes, modernist masterpieces and contemporary works, as well as collections of early American furniture and decorative arts.

Founded in 1842 and opened in 1844, it is the oldest continually operating public art museum in the United States.

The museum is located at 600 Main Street in a distinctive castle-like building in downtown Hartford, Connecticut, the state&#x27;s capital. With of exhibition space, the museum is the largest art museum in the state of Connecticut. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

The museum is a member of the North American Reciprocal Museums program.

== Museum history ==

===Namesake===
The Wadsworth, as it is most commonly known, was constructed on the site of the family home of Daniel Wadsworth in the heart of downtown Hartford. Its architects were Alexander Jackson Davis and Ithiel Town, who designed the &quot;castle&quot; that is the Atheneum&#x27;s oldest building. Construction began in 1842 after the museum was incorporated on June 1 of that year. The museum opened on July 31, 1844 and has operated continuously since then.

The Wadsworth family, being one of the oldest and most affluent in the city, contributed numerous valuable pieces of art to be displayed at the time the museum opened. The first collection consisted of 78 paintings, two marble busts, one portrait miniature, and one bronze sculpture. In addition to the fine arts collection, the original building housed the forerunners of the Hartford Public Library and Connecticut Historical Society, giving rise to the name &quot;Atheneum,&quot; an institution broadly devoted to culture and learning. In light of that public role, the Wadsworth has, since its founding, played host to a wide variety of cultural and community activities, including dramatic and dance performances, exhibits of historical artifacts, social functions, and benefits.

===Modern history===
Building on the Wadsworth family&#x27;s largess, generations of more recent donors have added to the museum&#x27;s collections and resources. Foremost among them are Elizabeth Jarvis Colt, widow of firearms magnate Samuel Colt, and financier and Hartford native John Pierpont Morgan. They each contributed more than 1,000 objects to the museum&#x27;s collections, the former a significant group of Hudson River School landscapes and the Colt firearms collection, the latter an assemblage of priceless Renaissance decorative arts and Colonial-era American furniture. Samuel P. Avery donated works ranging from a Babylonian clay tablet to Chinese Qing Dynasty porcelain and mid-19th century French sculpture, as well as funds for new construction, producing the country&#x27;s first museum interior designed in the International Style.

In 1927, the museum received a million-dollar bequest (about $20 million today in inflation-adjusted terms) from banker Frank Sumner, establishing a sizable acquisitions endowment. In the hands of forward-thinking museum directors, particularly A. Everett &#x27;Chick&#x27; Austin and Charles Cunningham, the fund has enabled the purchase of major works by masters including Caravaggio, Dalí, Gauguin, Miró, Strozzi, Tintoretto, Van Dyck, and Zurbarán.

In the 1940s and 1950s, bequests by Clara Hinton Gould and Anne Parrish Titzell enriched the museum&#x27;s holdings of Hudson River School and Impressionist paintings, with celebrated pieces by Church, Cole, Gifford, Monet, and Renoir entering the collection. In the same period, artwork and funds bequeathed to the museum by Henry Schnakenberg led to the acquisition of a group of Cypriot, Egyptian, and Greek antiquities as well as paintings by modernists including Peter Blume, Stuart Davis, and Reginald Marsh. It was also in the 1940s that the museum became the haunt of Marguerite Yourcenar as she wrote the &quot;Memoirs of Hadrian&quot;.

In 1973, Mierle Ukeles cleaned the steps of the museum&#x27;s entrance, as part of the all-female art exhibition c.7500, curated by Lucy Lippard.

The post-war and contemporary division has benefited from the generosity of Tony Smith and Susan Morse Hilles, whose gifts include groundbreaking works by Josef Albers, Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman, Robert Rauschenberg, and Mark Rothko. With funds given by the Archibald, Goodwin, Keney, and Smith families, and by Alexander Goldfarb and Charles Schwartz, the museum has acquired valuable pieces by Alexander Calder, Artemisia Gentileschi, Cindy Sherman, Bill Viola, and Kara Walker. A 2004 gift of 125 photographs from Janice and Mickey Cartin Collection includes works by On Kawara, Ed Ruscha, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Arnold Odermatt, Lucinda Devlin, Joe Ovelman, Jonathan Monk, Frank Breuer, Malick Sidibé, and more.
In 2001, the museum announced a large-scale $100 million expansion designed by the Amsterdam-based architects UNStudio; the architects were chosen from a short list of innovative design teams, including Zaha Hadid, Thom Mayne, and Brad Cloepfil. The design required demolishing the Goodwin Building, put up in 1969, and enclosing the Avery Courtyard. However, the proposal was scrapped in 2003 due to fundraising difficulties and changes in the museum&#x27;s leadership. A later plan to expand into the former Hartford Times building was also abandoned due to cost concerns. In March 2010, the museum announced the start of a comprehensive renovation project across all five of the museum&#x27;s buildings, which at completion resulted in the addition of of refurbished gallery space and the complete reinstallation of the museum&#x27;s permanent collections of European art, European decorative arts, and contemporary art. The $33 million renovation, designed by the Hartford-based architecture firm Smith Edwards McCoy, was completed in 2015, garnering praise from local and national art critics.

== Structure and contents ==
The structure itself consists of the original, castle-like building, plus four wings that have been added during the intervening years, in styles ranging from Tudor Revival and Renaissance Revival to International. The museum is home to approximately 50,000 objects, including ancient Roman, Greek, and Egyptian bronzes; paintings from the Renaissance, Baroque, and French and American Impressionist eras, among others; 18th-century German and French porcelains (including Meissen and Sèvres); Hudson River School landscapes; early American clothing and decorations; early African-American art and historical artifacts; and more. The collections span more than 5,000 years of world history.
Just outside the &quot;castle&quot; is an 1899 statue of Nathan Hale, by Enoch S. Woods. A short distance away, within the Connecticut State Capitol is another, better-known sculpture of Hale by Bela Pratt, a copy of his original at Yale University.

The Atheneum also owns the A. Everett Austin House, a National Historic Landmark and home of one of the museum&#x27;s most distinguished directors. The house, located in Hartford&#x27;s historic West End, is open to the public as a museum.

== Museum firsts ==
Since its beginning, the Wadsworth has had a long tradition of &quot;firsts&quot;.

In 1933, the Wadsworth sponsored George Balanchine&#x27;s immigration to the United States from the Soviet Union. Shortly after his immigration, Balanchine founded the School of American Ballet, which led to the formation of the New York City Ballet. He then chose to have the Producing Company of the School of American Ballet&#x27;s first performances at the Avery Memorial Theatre of Wadsworth in December 1934, including his first ballet choreographed in America, &quot;Serenade&quot;.

The museum was the first in America to acquire pieces by Salvador Dalí, Balthus, Frederic Church, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Piet Mondrian, and many other famous artists. Under the directorship of Arthur Everett Austin, Jr., the first American exhibition of surrealism was shown at the Wadsworth in 1931, and the first major U.S. Pablo Picasso retrospective was held in 1934. Also in 1934, the world premiere of the opera &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; by Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson was held at the Atheneum.

<text>Syphonota geographica, or the geographic sea hare, is a species of sea slug or sea hare, a marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusk in the family Aplysiidae, the sea hares.

This is the only species within this genus, in other words, Syphonota is a monotypic genus.

==Distribution==
This species is found in the Indo-West Pacific oceans, off Western Australia, and the Mediterranean, and Red seas.

==Description==
&quot;Syphonota&quot; differs from the other Aplysiidae genera, through the position of the rhinophores (head tentacles), which are further back, almost between the parapodial lobes. The parapodia, fleshy winglike outgrowths, come to a noticeable high point at the top of the animal.
The body coloration is whitish to green, with brown specks and a complicated network of white lines (hence the name &#x27;geographica&#x27;).

The maximum recorded length is 170 mm.

==Habitat==
This sea hare lives in lagoons and bays on sandy substrates.

Minimum recorded depth is 6 m. Maximum recorded depth is 7.5 m.

<text>James A. Yorke (born August 3, 1941) is a Distinguished University Research Professor of Mathematics and Physics and former chair of the Mathematics Department at the University of Maryland, College Park.

== Life and career ==
Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, United States, Yorke attended The Pingry School, then located in Hillside, New Jersey. Yorke is now a Distinguished University Research Professor of Mathematics and Physics with the Institute for Physical Science and Technology at the University of Maryland. In June 2013, Yorke retired as chair of the University of Maryland&#x27;s Math department. He devotes his university efforts to collaborative research in chaos theory and genomics.

He and Benoit Mandelbrot were the recipients of the 2003 Japan Prize in Science and Technology: Yorke was selected for his work in chaotic systems. In 2003 He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and in 2012 became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

He received the Doctor Honoris Causa degree from the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain, in January 2014. In June 2014, he received the Doctor Honoris Causa degree from Le Havre University, Le Havre, France. He was a 2016 Thomson Reuters Citations Laureate in Physics.

==Contributions==

===Period three implies chaos===
He and his co-author T.Y. Li coined the mathematical term &quot;chaos&quot; in a paper they published in 1975 entitled Period three implies chaos, in which it was proved that every one-dimensional continuous map

:&quot;F&quot;: R → R

that has a period-3 orbit must have two properties:

(1) For each positive integer &quot;p&quot;, there is a point in R that returns to where it started after &quot;p&quot; applications of the map and not before.

This means there are infinitely many periodic points (any of which may or may not be stable): different sets of points for each period &quot;p&quot;. This turned out to be a special case of Sharkovskii&#x27;s theorem.

The second property requires some definitions. A pair of points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; is called “scrambled” if as the map is applied repeatedly to the pair, they get closer together and later move apart and then get closer together and move apart, etc., so that they get arbitrarily close together without staying close together. The analogy is to an egg being scrambled forever, or to typical pairs of atoms behaving in this way. A set &quot;S&quot; is called a scrambled set if every pair of distinct points in &quot;S&quot; is scrambled. Scrambling is a kind of mixing.

(2) There is an uncountably infinite set &quot;S&quot; that is scrambled.

A map satisfying Property 2 is sometimes called &quot;chaotic in the sense of Li and Yorke&quot;. Property 2 is often stated succinctly as their article&#x27;s title phrase &quot;Period three implies chaos&quot;. The uncountable set of chaotic points may, however, be of measure zero (see for example the article Logistic map), in which case the map is said to have unobservable nonperiodicity or unobservable chaos.

===O.G.Y control method===
He and his colleagues (Edward Ott and Celso Grebogi) had shown with a numerical example that one can convert a chaotic motion into a periodic one by a proper time-dependent perturbation of the parameter. This article is considered a classic among the works in the control theory of chaos, and their control method is known as the O.G.Y. method.

===Books===
Together with Kathleen T. Alligood and Tim D. Sauer, he was the author of the book Chaos: An Introduction to Dynamical Systems.

<doc id="641026" wikidata="Q7058504" url="?curid=641026" title="1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum">
<text>A referendum was held in Northern Ireland on 22 May 1998 over whether there was support for the Good Friday Agreement. The result was a majority (71.1%) in favour. A simultaneous referendum held in the Republic of Ireland produced an even larger majority (94.4%) in favour.

The total number of people who voted (both referendums) was 2,499,078. 

==Party support==

All the main UK political parties (Labour, Conservative, and Liberal Democrat) supported the Yes campaign, though the Northern Ireland branch of the Conservatives supported the No campaign. Of the local Northern Ireland parties represented in the Northern Ireland Peace Forum, the Ulster Unionist Party, Social Democratic and Labour Party, Sinn Féin, Alliance, Progressive Unionist Party, Ulster Democratic Party, Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s Coalition and local &quot;Labour&quot; groups supported the proposals.

The only two parties in the Forum to campaign against the Agreement were the Democratic Unionist Party and the UK Unionist Party, though many prominent individuals in the Ulster Unionists also did so. Some minor parties campaigned against it. Republican Sinn Féin, which at the time did not run candidates in Northern Ireland, still opposes the agreement.

In the Republic of Ireland, all parties represented in the Oireachtas were in favour – Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Progressive Democrats, Democratic Left, Green Party, Sinn Féin and the Socialist Party.

==Results==
===Northern Ireland===
The referendum saw a large majority &#x27;Yes&#x27; vote across the province on Friday 22 May 1998. The votes were counted the next day. A total of 1,738 ballots were spoiled. Turnout, at 81.1%, was very high for a developed country where voting is not compulsory. Turnout in the equivalent referendum in the Republic of Ireland was average for a constitutional referendum but returned almost universal approval (94.39%).

===Republic of Ireland===

The referendum in the Republic of Ireland was held on the same day but rather than explicitly seeking approval of the Agreement itself it sought endorsement of constitutional amendments required by the Agreement, and produced an overwhelming Yes vote.

==Turnout==

The turnout in Northern Ireland was noticeably high at 81.1% and also quite high evenly throughout Northern Ireland, compared to many elections where turnout is highest in strong nationalist areas and significantly lower in unionist areas. It is estimated that approximately 147,000 people who do not normally vote in elections turned out to vote in the referendum, most of them in traditionally staunch unionist areas. In the Republic the turnout was lower, at 56.3%.

==Legislative responses==
The UK Parliament passed the Northern Ireland Act 1998, while in the Republic the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1998 passed into law.

<text>Ivan Alexandrovich Wyschnegradsky ( ; September 29, 1979), was a Russian composer primarily known for his microtonal compositions. For most of his life, from 1920 onwards, Wyschnegradsky lived in Paris.

==Life==
Ivan Wyschnegradsky was born in Saint Petersburg on May 4, 1893. His father, Alexander, was a banker, and his mother, Sophie, wrote poems. His grandfather Ivan was a celebrated mathematician who served as the Minister for Finance from 1888 to 1892. After his baccalaureate, Wyschnegradsky entered the School of Mathematics. He studied harmony, composition, and orchestration with Nicolas Sokolov at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. In 1912, he entered the School of Law. 

In November 1916, Wyschnegradsky had a spiritual vision. It inspired the composition of &quot;La Journée de l’Existence&quot; for narrator with orchestra and chorus. He worked on it for several decades, and it would not be performed until 1978. Most of his later work germinated from this singular experience. He completed his law studies the day before the revolution in 1917. His father died that November.

Wyschnegradsky moved to Paris in 1920. Three years later, he married Hélène Benois, the daughter of Alexandre Benois. It was her second marriage. Their son Dimitri was born in 1924. He grew up to become an influential blues historian using the pen name Jacques Demêtre. Wyschnegradsky and Benois divorced in 1926. His second wife was Lucile Markov (Gayden).

In 1942, Wyschnegradsky was arrested by the Germans and transferred to Royallieu-Compiègne internment camp, where he remained for two months. As an American, Lucile was interned at Vittel. After the war, he contracted tuberculosis and lived at the sanatorium of St. Martin-du-Tertre from 1947–50.

Lucile passed away in 1970. Wyschnegradsky&#x27;s senescence in his Paris apartment is often described as impoverished and austere. Paul Auster fictionalized his friendship with the composer in his 1986 novel &quot;The Locked Room&quot;. In the novel, Wyschnegradsky is mentioned by name and given a refrigerator by his much younger friend.

Wyschnegradsky died at the age of 86 in Paris on September 29, 1979.

==Music career==
Wyschnegradsky&#x27;s first performed work was &quot;Andante religioso and funèbre&quot; in 1912. César Cui attended the concert and congratulated Wyschnegradsky &quot;for his moderation&quot;. He was enthusiastic about the Russian Revolution and set Vasily Knyazev&#x27;s &quot;The Red Gospel&quot; to music. 

Wyschnegradsky was deeply influenced by Alexander Scriabin&#x27;s mysticism and approach to tonality. Though he did not attend Mikhail Matyushin&#x27;s Futurist opera &quot;Victory over the Sun&quot; in 1913, the brief use of quarter-tones in the score had a profound effect on his artistic development. In 1919, Wyschnegradsky provided incidental music for a production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Bolshoi Drama Theater.

Wyschnegradsky soon became convinced that equal temperament was inadequate for his work and began writing in microtones. All of the composer&#x27;s early microtonal work was executed on two pianos tuned a quarter-tone apart. A primary motivation for his emigration in 1920 was the desire to develop instruments capable of playing microtones. He had every intention of returning to the Soviet Union, but it had changed too much by the time he was ready a few years later. 

Wyschnegrasky designed a quarter-tone keyboard with three manuals. The quarter tone scale (24-tet: 50 cents) is the most frequent microtonality in his work. Wyschnegradsky also wrote one piece for Julián Carrillo&#x27;s third-tone piano (18-tet: 66. cents). In purusit of what he called &quot;ultrachromaticisim&quot;, Wyschnegradsky composed in even smaller divisions of the octave such as sixth tones (36-tet: 33. cents) and twelfth tones (72-tet: 16. cents). 

Gustave Lyon at Pleyel was sympathetic to Wyschnegradsky&#x27;s ambitions. The firm manufactured a quarter-tone piano for him in 1921 that relied on the pneumatic Pleyela system in their player pianos. The instrument produced inconsistent tone, making it undesirable for the composer. However, he did make extended use of punching piano rolls to develop the sophistication of his music. There was more quarter-tone interest in Berlin where he went to work with Richard Stein, Alois Hába, Jörg Mager, and Willy von Möllendorff. 

In Braunschweig, Hába and Möllendorff were advising Grotrian-Steinweg on a quarter-tone piano. There were many disagreements about the layout for the keyboard. Möllendorf had designed a Straube harmonium with smaller keys for microtones. Wyschnegradsky found it effective enough to purchase one, but he knew keyboards like Möllendorf&#x27;s and Paul von Jankó&#x27;s did not afford enough kinetic potential to performers.

Grotrian-Steinweg built a prototype and marketed it in the spring of 1924. The instrument is lost, but the firm still has a portion of the keyboard mechanism in their archive. Hába realized the project with August Förster in 1928 using a keyboard based on Wyschnegradsky&#x27;s design. 

In 1929, one of the Förster upright quarter-tone pianos was delivered to Wyschnegradsky&#x27;s apartment in Paris where he composed on it for the rest of his life. Even with a suitable quarter-tone instrument, Wyschnegradsky still found performing his music more feasible with separately tuned piano ensembles. Hába disapproved of the technique, preferring quarter-tone music to be performed on quarter-tone instruments. Wyschnegradsky reminded Hába that he designed the quarter-tone keyboard and that when two pianos of the same make are tuned correctly they sound like one instrument. 

Though living in Paris, Wyschnegradsky&#x27;s microtonal work was influential in Russia during the twenties. He maintained a correspondence with Georgy Rimsky-Korsakov (Nikolai&#x27;s grandson) who organized performances of his work on programs of microtonal music by young Soviet composers. Dmitri Shostakovich often performed on these concerts.

In 1932, he published a 24-page brochure about quarter-tones. In 1934, he composed &quot;Twenty-four Preludes in All the Tones of the Chromatic Scale Diatonicized with Thirteen Sounds&quot;, for two pianos in quarter tones.

As early as November 1918, Wyschnegradsky had begun working on &quot;Ainsi parlait Zarathoustra&quot; based on Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s sketch for the novel. His original ensemble was a standard orchestra with quarter-tone clarinet, harmonium, and piano. Its finished form was for four pianos, 2 tuned to 435 Hertz and 2 tuned a quarter-tone higher. It was premiered along with several of his other works at the Salle Pleyel on January 25, 1937. The concert was a success and led to friendships with fellow composers Olivier Messiaen, Henri Dutilleux, and Claude Ballif. In October 1938, Wyschnegradsky directed the recording of the third movement of &quot;Zarathoustra&quot;.

After the war, Wyschnegradsky organized another concert of his work at the Salle Pleyel on November 11, 1945. The performers included several of Messiaen&#x27;s students such as Yvonne Loriod, Pierre Boulez, and Serge Nigg. In 1951, Pierre Boulez, Yvette Grimaud, Claude Helffer, and Ina Marika gave a performance of the composer&#x27;s &quot;Second Symphonic Fragment&quot; in Paris. &quot;The Revue Musicale&quot; published a special issue on Ivan Wyschnegradsky and Nicolas Obouhow in 1972.

1977 saw special concerts of Wyschnegradsky&#x27;s music organized at Radio France by Martine Joste and in Canada by Bruce Mather. The composer also improvised on piano for one of Margaret Fisher&#x27;s performances in Paris that year. In 1978, Alexandre Myrat conducted the premiere of &quot;La Journée de l’Existence&quot; with the Orchestre philharmonique de Radio France. Ivan Wyschnegradsky was invited to the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program. He could not go due to ill health. His last commission was from Radio France for a string trio. He died before he could complete it.

==Theories==
Throughout his career, Wyschnegradsky wrote theoretical articles in a variety of languages. He worked on a microtonality treatise for decades. Titled &quot;La Loi de la Pansonorité&quot; (The Law of Pansonority), it was not published in his lifetime.

&quot;Pansonority&quot; was Wyschnegradsky&#x27;s way of articulating the mystical experience he had in 1916. He realized that music represented a separation of sounds out of a continuous fabric that exists in the universe. Of this pansonority, Wyschnegradsky wrote in 1927:
&quot;...isolated sounds do not exist...the entire musical space is filled with living sonorous matter.
 This state, absolutely incomprehensible to human reason, may be clearly felt, and sentiment can perceive or &quot;hear&quot; this sonority through a manner of inner intuition.
 But musical art operates through detached sounds, and because of this it is artificial and anti-continuous. Hence the primordial tragedy of music: the impossibility of attaining its ideal: Pan-sonority. And yet, in spite of this, the entire history of musical art is nothing but an attempt to reach the ideal.

As evidence for pansonority, Wyschnegradsky would point to the inaccurate assignment of note names to overtones. Partials like the 11th, 13th, and 14th are raised by an entire quarter-tone to fit into equal temperament. Since these quarter-tones are naturally occurring in the harmonic series, Wyschnegradsky posits that microintervals are organic and provide a richer tone world.

In 1932, Wyschnegradsky published a brief but methodical brochure on microtonality, advancing the field beyond what had been written to date by composers like Charles Ives and Alois Hába. &quot;Manuel d’harmonie á quarts de ton&quot; (Manual of Quarter-Tone Harmony) systematizes microintervals, albeit with idiosyncratic names. For instance, a major third that has been lowered by a quarter-tone is called &quot;neutral&quot; because it is neither major nor minor. A perfect fourth that has been raised by a quarter-tone is called &quot;major&quot;.

Part of Wyschnegradsky&#x27;s mystical vision of pantonality corresponded to the color spectrum. As he aged, he spent more of his energy on producing chromatic drawings that resemble mandalas. The 12 pitches of the chromatic scale are assigned different colors and the microtones are related shades. Like Scriabin, Wyschnegradsky wanted to combine color and sound, and he envisioned the chromatic drawings as projections on a dome above the audience.

<text>Margaret Adele Fairley born Margaret Adele Keeling (1885–1968) was a British-born Canadian writer, educator, and political activist. From 1936
until her death, she was a member of the Communist Party of Canada (CPC). She was deported from the USA for her politics and there is a park named for her in Toronto.

==Life==
Margaret was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, UK Her mother was Henrietta Frances (born Gedge) and her father was the Reverend William Hulton Keeling who transformed Northampton and Bradford Grammar School. Her elder sister was Dorothy Keeling a leading social worker.

At a time when the university did not grant degrees to women, she studied at Oxford and finished with a &quot;first&quot; in English. She became tutor in English at St Hilda&#x27;s College, and in 1912 was appointed advisor to women students at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. She held this position only for a year, before marrying Barker Fairley, a fellow Yorkshireman and professor of modern languages. The U of A granted her a Bachelor of Arts degree. After the birth of Joan (Hall) and Tom, the family moved to Toronto, where they had Elizabeth, William and Ann (Schabas) where she lived until her death 1968.

Her first book was an edition of poems (&quot;Coleridge Poems, 1794-1807&quot;, published in 1910). It includes a 49-page biographical essay introducing Coleridge &quot;as a Poet of Nature and Romance.&quot; She was editor from 1952 to 1956 of &quot;New Frontiers&quot;, a journal published by the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, and two other books:
*&quot;The Spirit of Canadian Democracy&quot; (1946)
*&quot;Selected Writings of William Lyon Mackenzie&quot; (1960)

She moved in the same intellectual circles as historian Stanley Ryerson and poet Dorothy Livesay.

In 1949, while attending the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, she was deported from the United States. She died in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at the age of 82.

On June 23, 1972, the City of Toronto named a park after her at the corner of Brunswick Avenue and Ulster Street. The City provided a plaque with her name on a granite boulder. Later, family and friends raised the money to erect a bronze bust.

Some of her manuscripts are in the collection of the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto.

Her son-in-law is a musician Ezra Schabas and her grandson is an academic William Schabas as is her granddaughter Margaret Schabas.

<text>Richard Anthony Proctor FRAS (23 March 1837 – 12 September 1888) was an English astronomer. He is best remembered for having produced one of the earliest maps of Mars in 1867 from 27 drawings by the English observer William Rutter Dawes. His map was later superseded by those of Giovanni Schiaparelli and Eugène Antoniadi and his nomenclature was dropped (for instance, his &quot;Kaiser Sea&quot; became Syrtis Major Planum).

He used old drawings of Mars dating back to 1666 to try to determine the sidereal day of Mars. His final estimate, in 1873, was 24h 37m 22.713s, very close to the modern value of 24h 37m 22.663s.

The crater Proctor on Mars is named after him.

==Biography==
Richard Proctor&#x27;s father died in 1850 and his mother attended to his education. He was sent to King&#x27;s College London and subsequently earned a scholarship at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1860 as 23rd wrangler.

Proctor then read for the bar, but turned to astronomy and authorship instead, and in 1865 published an article on the &quot;Colours of Double Stars&quot; in the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;. His first book &quot;Saturn and its System&quot; was published in the same year, at his own expense. This work contains an elaborate account of the phenomena presented by the planet; but although favourably received by astronomers, it had no great sale. He intended to follow it up with similar treatises on Mars, Jupiter, Sun, Moon, comets and meteors, stars, and nebulae, and had in fact commenced a monograph on Mars, when the failure of a New Zealand bank deprived him of an independence which would have enabled him to carry out his scheme without anxiety as to its commercial success or failure.

Being thus obliged to depend upon his writings for the support of his family, and having learned by the fate of his &quot;Saturn and its System&quot; that the general public are not attracted by works requiring arduous study, he cultivated a more popular style. He wrote for a number of periodicals; and although he has stated that he would at this time willingly have turned to stone-breaking on the roads, or any other form of hard and honest but unscientific labour, if a modest competence had been offered him in any such direction, he attained a high degree of popularity, and his numerous works had a wide influence in familiarising the public with the main facts of astronomy.

Proctor&#x27;s earlier efforts were not always successful. His &quot;Handbook of the Stars&quot; (1866) was refused by Messrs Longmans and Messrs Macmillan, but being privately printed, it sold fairly well. For his &quot;Half-Hours with the Telescope&quot; (1868), which eventually reached a 20th edition, he received originally £25 from Messrs Hardwick. Although teaching was uncongenial to him he took pupils in mathematics, and held for a time the position of mathematical coach for Woolwich and Sandhurst. 

Proctor&#x27;s literary standing meantime improved, and he became a regular contributor to &quot;The Intellectual Observer&quot;, &quot;Chamber&#x27;s Journal&quot; and the &quot;Popular Science Review&quot;. In 1870 appeared his &quot;Other Worlds Than Ours&quot;, in which he discussed the question of the plurality of worlds in the light of new facts. This was followed by a long series of popular treatises in rapid succession, amongst the more important of which are &quot;Light Science for Leisure Hours&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; (1871); &quot;The Orbs around Us&quot; and &quot;Essays on Astronomy&quot; (1872); &quot;The Expanse of Heaven&quot;, &quot;The Moon&quot; and &quot;The Borderland of Science&quot; (1873); &quot;The Universe and the Coming Transits&quot; and &quot;Transits of Venus&quot; (1874); &quot;Our Place among Infinities&quot; (1875); &quot;Myths and Marvels of Astronomy&quot; (1877); &quot;The Universe of Stars&quot; (1878); &quot;Flowers of the Sky&quot; (1879); &quot;The Poetry of Astronomy&quot; (1880); &quot;Easy Star Lessons&quot; and &quot;Familiar Science Studies&quot; (1882); &quot;Mysteries of Time and Space (1883) - Digital Copy&quot;; &quot;The Great Pyramid&quot; (1883) - Digital Copy; &quot;The Universe of Suns&quot; (1884); &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1885); &quot;Other Suns than Ours&quot; and &quot;Half-Hours with the Stars&quot; (1887).

In 1881 Proctor founded &quot;Knowledge&quot;, a popular weekly magazine of science (converted into a monthly in 1885), which had a considerable circulation. In it he wrote on a great variety of subjects, including chess and whist.

Proctor was also the author of the articles on astronomy in the &quot;American Cyclopaedia&quot; and the ninth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, and was well known as a popular lecturer on astronomy in England, America and Australia.

Proctor was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 8 June 1866. He became honorary secretary in 1872, and contributed eighty-three separate papers to its Monthly Notices. Of these the more noteworthy dealt with the distribution of stars, star clusters and nebulae, and the construction of the sidereal universe. He was an expert in all that related to map-drawing, and published two star-atlases. A chart on an isographic projection, exhibiting all the stars contained in the Bonner Durchmusterung, was designed to show the laws according to which the stars down to the 9–10th magnitude are distributed over the northern heavens. His &quot;Theoretical Considerations&quot; respecting the Corona (Monthly Notices, xxxi. 184, 254) also deserve mention, as well as his discussions of the rotation of Mars, by which be deduced its period with a probable error of 0.005. He also vigorously criticised the official arrangements for observing the transits of Venus of 1874 and 1882. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1874.

Proctor&#x27;s largest and most ambitious work, &quot;Old and New Astronomy&quot;, left unfinished at his death, was completed by Arthur Cowper Ranyard and published in 1892 with a second edition in 1895. He settled in America some time after his second marriage in 1881, and died of yellow fever at New York City on 12 September 1888. A monument was later erected in his memory. Mary Proctor, his daughter by his first marriage, became an astronomer and a successful lecturer and writer. Proctor’s second wife, Sallie (1856-1941), was also active in astronomy.

<text>The Longarm books were a series of western novels featuring the character of Custis Long, who is nicknamed Longarm, a U.S. Deputy Marshal based in Denver, Colorado in the 1880s. The nickname plays on his surname and role as the &quot;long arm of the law&quot;. 

The series was written by &quot;Tabor Evans&quot;, a house pseudonym used by a number of authors at Jove Books. Lou Cameron helped create the character and wrote a number of the early books in the series. The first book was published in 1978 and new ones were added at a rate of approximately one a month through 2015. In addition to the regular series, there was a series of &quot;giant editions&quot; which were longer novels.

The Longarm series was a mainstay of the &quot;adult western&quot; genre which arose in the 1970s. These books are distinguished from classical westerns by the inclusion of more explicit sex and violence. In addition to Cameron, other authors known to have written books in the series include Melvin Marshall, Will C. Knott, Frank Roderus, Chet Cunningham, J. Lee Butts, Gary McCarthy, James Reasoner, Jeffrey M. Wallmann, Peter Brandvold and Harry Whittington.

<doc id="641036" wikidata="Q230433" url="?curid=641036" title="Empress Masako">
<text>is Empress of Japan as the wife of Emperor Naruhito.

Born in Tokyo, Masako was educated at Belmont High School in Massachusetts before attending Harvard College, earning a B.A., &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, in economics. She also studied law at the University of Tokyo and international relations at Balliol College, Oxford. She then worked for Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a diplomat. 

Masako met Crown Prince Naruhito in 1986. They married in 1993; their only child, Aiko, Princess Toshi, was born in 2001. The birth fueled the ongoing Japanese imperial succession debate, which had resulted in some politicians holding a favorable view on rescinding agnatic primogeniture imposed by World War II allies on the constitution of Japan. However, with the birth of a son to Naruhito&#x27;s brother, Prince Fumihito, in 2006, no amendments were made and Aiko remains ineligible to inherit the throne, so she cannot succeed her father.

The pressure to produce a male heir affected Masako&#x27;s health. She was diagnosed with adjustment disorder in 2004, which forced her to withdraw from public life periodically. As crown princess and empress, Masako has accompanied her husband on official visits to foreign countries and at ceremonies within the imperial court.

==Early life and education==

 was born on 9 December 1963 at Toranomon Hospital in Toranomon, Minato, Tokyo. She is the eldest daughter of Yumiko Egashira (b. 1938) and Hisashi Owada (b. 1932), a senior diplomat and former president of the International Court of Justice. She has two younger sisters, twins named Setsuko and Reiko (b. 1966).

Masako went to live in Moscow with her parents when she was two years old, where she attended Detskiy Sad (kindergarten in Russian) No. 1127 daycare. At the age of five, Masako&#x27;s family moved to New York City, where she attended kindergarten at Public School 81 in Riverdale.

In 1971, the Owadas returned to Japan, moving in with Masako&#x27;s maternal grandparents in Meguro while Hisashi returned to the Foreign Ministry office. She entered Futaba Gakuen, a private Roman Catholic girls&#x27; school in Den-en-chōfu, Tokyo. Established by the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus in 1872, Masako&#x27;s mother and maternal grandmother had graduated from this school as well. It was here that Masako learned to play piano and tennis, joined a handicrafts club, and became interested in animals, tending several after school and deciding to become a veterinarian. Masako also studied her fourth and fifth languages, French and German. With a school friend, Masako revived Futaba&#x27;s softball team, serving as third base and after three years bringing her team to the district championships.

In 1979, her second year of senior high school, Masako and her family moved to the United States and settled in the Boston suburb of Belmont, Massachusetts, where her father became a guest professor of international law at Harvard University&#x27;s Center for International Affairs. In 1981, she graduated from Belmont High School, where she was president of the National Honor Society and participated in the school&#x27;s math team and French club. Masako joined the school&#x27;s softball team and won a Goethe Society award for her German poetry. Masako participated in a production of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

Masako&#x27;s father was posted to Moscow after her high school graduation, but Masako remained in Boston to continue her education; In 1981 she enrolled at Harvard College, where she chaired the school&#x27;s Japan Society, &quot;became quite close friends with the then Japanese consul in Boston, and volunteered as a kind of self-appointed diplomat and cultural ambassador&quot; in the wake of mounting Japan–United States trade tension. Masako liked to ski and traveled overseas during vacations, staying with a host family in France and studying at the Goethe-Institut. Masako is fluent in English and in French, which she learned in 1983 at the University Center for French Studies at Université Grenoble Alpes. Masako worked with Jeffrey Sachs to obtain a B.A. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in economics in March 1985.

==Professional career==

After graduation Masako moved back to Japan, where for six months (April to October 1986) she studied law at the University of Tokyo to prepare for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x27;s entrance examination. Out of 800 applicants only 28 passed; Masako was one of them, along with two other women.

&quot;She was assigned, first, to the oddly named Second International Organizations Division which deals with Japan&#x27;s relations with international agencies, such as the OECD, a club of 30 rich countries committed to free trade and development. Her assignments included dealing with the OECD&#x27;s environmental affairs committee ... by all accounts she acquitted herself well—her command of spoken languages, so rare in Japan, was a huge advantage—and was popular with most of her workmates.&quot; During her free time, Masako attended cooking classes to, according to interviews with her instructor, &quot;be able to cook proper Japanese dishes when she was entertaining [foreigners].&quot;

Two years later, in 1988, Masako was chosen by the Ministry to be sponsored for two years&#x27; postgraduate study overseas with full pay, just as her father Hisashi had been years earlier. Masako &quot;desperately wanted to go back to Harvard to do her master&#x27;s&quot;. According to her former Harvard adviser Oliver Oldman, she &quot;tried to re-enroll to work towards ... a Juris Doctor. However, Harvard&#x27;s bureaucrats would not give her credit for her study-time at the University of Tokyo.&quot; Therefore, Masako enrolled in her second choice, studying international relations under Sir Adam Roberts at Balliol College, Oxford. However, for unclear reasons Masako did not finish her thesis and instead returned to Japan in 1990.

==Courtship and marriage==

Masako first met Prince Naruhito at a tea for Infanta Elena of Spain, in November 1986, during her studies at the University of Tokyo. The prince was immediately captivated by her and arranged for them to meet several times over the next few weeks. Because of this they were pursued relentlessly by the press throughout 1987.
However, Masako&#x27;s name disappeared from the list of possible royal brides due to controversy about her maternal grandfather, Yutaka Egashira, who while working for the Industrial Bank of Japan was assigned to take over management of one of its debtors the Chisso Corporation to prevent it from financial collapse. Chisso, built in the 1930s, dumped the methylmercury used to make acetaldehyde (a chemical in plastic) into the water surrounding Minamata and other towns, causing the infamous Minamata disease and the resulting scandal.

Despite this controversy and Masako&#x27;s travelling to Oxford University&#x27;s Balliol College for the next two years, Naruhito remained interested in her. Masako refused to marry the prince because it would force her to give up her promising career in diplomacy and severely restrict her independence and freedoms. Masako finally accepted his third proposal on 9 December 1992. It was reported that he argued that serving as Crown Princess of Japan would only be &quot;another form of diplomacy&quot; before she finally accepted this third proposal. The Imperial Household Council formally announced the engagement on 19 January 1993; the engagement ceremony was held on 12 April 1993. Although many were surprised at the news, as it was believed that the prince and Masako had separated, the engagement was met with a surge of renewed media attention directed toward the Imperial family and their new princess.

Masako married Crown Prince Naruhito in a traditional wedding ceremony on 9 June 1993. By virtue of the marriage, Masako Owada assumed the formal style &quot;Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess of Japan&quot;. As tradition dictates, upon her entry into the imperial family and like other members, she received the blossom of the endemic curly-leaved Japanese Ramanas rose (): &quot;Rosa rugosa&quot; () for an imperial personal emblem, which is mauve-lilac to crimson or white (rarely with cultivars to full or burst yellow), while her insignia as Crown Princess bear the forms of the imperial household&#x27;s antique gold-traced white chrysanthemum. In addition, she was placed in the Japanese Imperial Order of Precedence (used for the most formal occasions) behind her mother-in-law, Empress Michiko, and her grandmother-in-law, Empress Dowager Nagako. The orchid flower &quot;Dendrobium&quot; cultivar &quot;Masako Kotaishi Hidenka&quot; was named in her honour to celebrate the wedding.

Masako became the third commoner to marry into the imperial family, after her mother-in-law, Empress Emerita Michiko (Michiko Shōda) and her sister-in-law, Crown Princess Kiko (Kiko Kawashima).

===Children===

Masako&#x27;s first pregnancy was announced in December 1999, but she miscarried.

The Emperor and Empress have one daughter: .

===Succession crisis===
Their daughter&#x27;s birth, which occurred more than eight years after their marriage, sparked lively debate in Japan about whether &quot;The Imperial Household Law of 1947&quot; should be changed from that of agnatic primogeniture to either cognatic or absolute primogeniture, which would allow a woman to succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne.

A government-appointed panel of experts submitted a report on 25 October 2005, recommending that the Imperial Succession Law be amended to permit absolute primogeniture. On 20 January 2006, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi used part of his annual keynote speech to address the controversy when he pledged to submit a bill to the National Diet letting women ascend to the throne in order that the imperial throne be continued in a stable manner. Koizumi did not announce a timing for the legislation to be introduced nor did he provide details about the content, but he did note that it would be in line with the conclusions of the 2005 Government Panel.

Plans to change the male-only law of Imperial succession were shelved after it was announced in February 2006 that Masako&#x27;s brother-in-law and his wife, Prince and Princess Akishino, were expecting their third child. On 6 September 2006, Princess Akishino gave birth to a son, Hisahito, who was third-in-line to the Chrysanthemum Throne under the current law, after his uncle, the Emperor, and his father, Prince Akishino.

==Crown Princess of Japan==
In 1994, the couple visited Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain. They visited Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan in 1995, and again traveled to Jordan in 1999. In 1999, they also went to Belgium to attend the wedding of Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant. In 2002, they paid a visit to New Zealand and Australia. In 2006, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess went to the Netherlands with their daughter, Princess Aiko, at the invitation of Queen Beatrix for a private visit.

On 30 April 2013, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess were present at the inauguration of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, which was the Crown Princess&#x27;s first official overseas appearance in eleven years. In October 2014, she was present at a banquet held in honour of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima at the Tokyo Imperial Palace, which was her first appearance in such a ceremony in eleven years. She welcomed the couple during an official ceremony at the palace which was her first appearance in a welcoming ceremony after five years. In July 2015, Princess Masako traveled to Tonga with the Crown Prince in order to attend the Coronation of King Tupou VI. Over 40 members of the Japanese media covered the event, during which the happy-looking Crown Princess was warmly welcomed.

==Empress of Japan==

Upon the abdication of Masako&#x27;s father-in-law, Emperor Akihito of Heisei era on 30 April 2019, his eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito became the 126th Emperor of Japan, and his wife, Masako became empress consort on 1 May. The Emperor and Empress of Reiwa era were enthroned (&quot;Sokui Rei Seiden no Gi&quot;) at the Tokyo Imperial Palace on 22 October 2019.

Naruhito and Masako&#x27;s first trip abroad as emperor and empress took place in September 2022, to the United Kingdom to attend the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. They visited Indonesia in June 2023, their first state visit.

In March 2024, Masako and Naruhito visited Wajima and Suzu, two cities affected by the Noto earthquake. The couple later visited an evacuation center in Anamizu on 12 April.

Masako and Naruhito embarked on a three-day state visit to the United Kingdom in late June 2024, at the invitation of King Charles III. The imperial couple had originally planned to visit in 2020 as guests of Queen Elizabeth II, but the state visit was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rescheduled visit went ahead despite concerns of postponement due to the British general election campaign that began in late May. It was the first state visit in modern times to take place during an active election campaign.

==Health==

Masako has periodically been out of the public eye, largely between 2004 and 2014, reportedly due to emotional disorders speculated to be caused by the pressure to produce a male heir and adjusting to life in the Imperial Family. In July 2004, she was diagnosed as suffering from adjustment disorder and was reported to be seeking treatment.

On 11 July 2008, Naruhito sought public understanding for his ailing wife. He was on an eight-day trip to Spain without her: &quot;I would like the public to understand that Masako is continuing to make her utmost efforts with the help of those around her. Please continue to watch over her kindly and over the long term.&quot; Pressures to produce a male heir, to conform with the ancient traditions and a 1947 Imperial Household Law are perceived to be behind her illness, as well as negative media coverage of her behavior, the stress of royal responsibility and public life, and turf battles among the Imperial Household Agency.

In December 2012, at the time of her 49th birthday, Masako issued a statement thanking the Japanese people for their support and saying that she was still receiving treatment for her illness. The Japanese Constitution does not allow the members of the Imperial Family to engage in political activities. Naruhito made controversial comments about discourtesies and pressures placed on his wife by the Imperial Household Agency and his wife&#x27;s desire to pursue the life of a diplomat.

In 2019, Masako accompanied her husband at official events and at his accession ceremonies. During the state visit of U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump to Japan in April, Masako and Naruhito conversed with them without interpreters; the imperial couple are both fluent in English. Her doctors stated that she has not fully recovered but a strong sense of duty has helped her fulfill her responsibilities.

==Ancestry==
Her father Hisashi is descended from the Owada clan, whose head Shinroku—Masako&#x27;s 4th-great-grandfather—was called to Murakami in 1787 to serve the Naito clan that the Tokugawa shōgun had installed as the city&#x27;s rulers 67 years earlier. After the fall of the shogunate, the Owadas participated in a salmon-fishing cooperative, the proceeds of which provided schooling for many local children, including Hisashi and his father Takeo.

Her mother Yumiko is descended from the Egashira clan which served the Saga clans near Nagasaki on the island of Kyushu. One of the Egashiras, Yasutaro, went on to command a battleship in the Russo-Japanese War. Yumiko&#x27;s father was a wealthy banker who was at the time of her marriage the managing director of the Industrial Bank of Japan.

<text>Santa María la Antigua del Darién—turned into Dariena in the Latin of De Orbo Novo—was a Spanish colonial town founded in 1510 by Vasco Núñez de Balboa, located in present-day Colombia approximately south of Acandí, within the municipality of Unguía in the Chocó Department. It was the first city founded by conquistadors in mainland America. After Pascual de Andagoya, a Spanish-Basque conquistador under the direction of Panama governor Pedrarias Dávila, founded Panama City in 1519, Santa María la Antigua del Darién was abandoned and in 1524 was attacked and burned by the indigenous people.

In 2012 the lost site of the town was rediscovered, and in 2019 the government of Colombia opened the Parque Arqueológico e Histórico de Santa María de Belén la Antigua del Darién.

<text>The batman () was a unit of mass used in the Ottoman Empire and among Turkic peoples of the Russian Empire. It has also been recorded as a unit of area in Uyghur-speaking regions of Central Asia. The name is Turkic (; ), but was also sometimes used for the equivalent unit in Persia ( ). The equivalent unit in British India was anglicized as the maund (Bengali: and Hindustani: ). The value of the batman (or maund) varied considerably from place to place.

==Origins==
The &quot;man&quot; as a unit of weight is thought to be of at least Chaldean origin, with Sir Henry Yule attributing Akkadian origins to the word. The Hebrew () and the Ancient Greek () are thought to be cognate. It was originally equal to one-ninth of the weight of an &quot;artaba&quot; of water, or approximately four kilograms in modern units. İnalcık believes the ancient Persian &quot;patimāna&quot; may have come from the late Assyrian word for &#x27;mana of the king&#x27;. The &quot;man&quot; or &quot;batman&quot; spread throughout Arabia and Persia: it was adopted by the Ottoman Empire, and brought to India by the Mughal Empire. The first attestation which gives a comparison to European weights was by Pegolotti in his &quot;Pratica della mercatura&quot;, written about 1340. He reported the &quot;batman&quot; as the main unit of mass in Ayasluğ (&quot;Altoluogo di Turchia&quot; to Pegolotti; modern Selçuk, in western Turkey), equivalent to 32 Genoese pounds ().

==Ottoman Empire==
The batman (or bateman) was first recorded in English in 1599, in Babylon (probably modern Baghdad), where it was said to be equal to &quot;7 pound and 5 ounces English weight&quot;. In the central Ottoman system of weights, the batman was equal to six okas, as is attested in 1811 in Aleppo, 1821 in Baghdad and in 1850 in Constantinople. At this point, the batman was equal to 16 lb 8 oz avoirdupois (7.484 kg).

===Arabia===

The &quot;mann&quot; ( مَنّ ) had doubtless formed a part of the Arabian system of weights before the arrival of the Ottomans. It was divided into &quot;uqiyyas&quot; (the number varying with the location), while ten &quot;mann&quot; made one &quot;frazil&quot;. A still larger unit of mass was the &quot;bahar&quot;, of ten to forty &quot;frazils&quot;. The Arabic &quot;mann&quot; was smaller than the Ottoman &quot;batman&quot; at about 2–3 lb av. (1–1½ kg), except in Basra where there were two maunds in use, both much larger than either the Arabic &quot;mann&quot; or the Ottoman &quot;batman&quot;.

===Turkey===
The Turkish system of weights and measures was metricated in 1931. The &quot;oka&quot; was redefined as exactly one kilogram, while the &quot;batman&quot; became ten &quot;okas&quot; (10 kg).

==Central Asia==
The batman was used in Central Asia up until at least the 18th century. In Khiva in 1740, there were said to be two batmans (as in Persia): the &quot;great batman&quot; of 18 Russian pounds (, &quot;funt&quot;; approx. 7.4 kg) and the &quot;lesser batman&quot; of 9¼ Russian pounds (approx. 3.8 kg).

In Uyghur, the batman was also a measure of land area, the area that could be sown with one batman (in mass) of seed.

==Idel-Ural==
The Tatar batman is an equivalent to 4 pood or 65.5 kg.

==Persia==

The two main commercial weights in Persia were the &quot;tabrézy man&quot; ( من تبریز ), literally the &quot;man&quot; of Tabriz, and the &quot;sháhy man&quot; ( من شاء ), literally the Shah&#x27;s &quot;man&quot;, which was twice as large. The &quot;sháhy man&quot; was particularly used in Shiraz and Isfahan. Kelly also distinguishes a &quot;man&quot; used for copra and &quot;provisions&quot; at Gamron (modern Bandar-Abbas) of 7 lb 12 oz av. (3.5153 kg).

The United Nations Statistical Office found a wide range of values for the &quot;man&quot; in Iran in 1966, from 3 kg to 53 kg. The &quot;man&quot; was divided into &quot;mithqals&quot; (the number depending on the locality): larger subdivisions included the &quot;abbassi&quot; and the &quot;ratl&quot;. The term &quot;batman&quot; appears to be reserved for the &quot;tabrézy man&quot;, approximately 2.969 kg in 1966.

===Afghanistan===
The &quot;mann&quot; () was and still is also used as a unit of mass in Afghanistan, but varied widely between different localities. In Kandahar it was about 8 lb av. (3½ kg), while in Peshawar it was 80 lb av. (35 kg).

<text>Auto Club Speedway (known as California Speedway before and after the 2008–2023 corporate sponsorship by the Automobile Club of Southern California) is a defunct , D-shaped oval superspeedway in unincorporated San Bernardino County, California, near Fontana. It hosted National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) racing annually from 1997 until 2023. It was also previously used for open wheel racing events. The racetrack was located east of Los Angeles and was near the former locations of Ontario Motor Speedway and Riverside International Raceway. The track was last owned and operated by NASCAR. The speedway was served by the nearby Interstates 10 and 15 as well as a Metrolink station located behind the backstretch.

Construction of the track, on the site of the former Kaiser Steel Mill, began in 1995 and was completed in late 1996. The speedway&#x27;s main grandstand had a capacity of 68,000. Additionally it featured 28 skyboxes and had a total capacity of 122,000. In 2006, a fanzone was added behind the main grandstand. Lights were added to the speedway in 2004 with the addition of a second annual NASCAR weekend. From 2011 to 2023, the track hosted only one NASCAR weekend each year.

A 500-mile American open-wheel car race was held under Championship Auto Racing Teams sanctioning from 1997 to 2002. The current IndyCar sanctioning body ran a 400-mile race from 2002 to 2005 and a 500-mile race from 2012 to 2015, which was usually the season finale. Its last IndyCar race was the 2015 MAVTV 500.

In 2023, the track was closed for reconstruction as part of the Next Gen California project and demolition started in October 2023. In late November of 2024 however, NASCAR president Steve Phelps would say in an interview on SiruisXM NASCAR radio that doubts of rebuilding Auto Club Speedway into a short track were at an all-time high due to high construction costs as well as NASCAR having other priorities higher on their list with Fontana being at the bottom of that priority list.

== Track history ==

=== Early history and construction ===

On April 20, 1994, Roger Penske and Kaiser Steel announced the construction of a racetrack on the site of the abandoned Kaiser Steel Mill in Fontana, California. A day after the announcement, Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) announced it would hold an annual race at the speedway. Three months later NASCAR president Bill France Jr. agreed to sanction NASCAR Cup Series races at the speedway upon completion, marking the first time NASCAR made a commitment to run a race at a track that had yet to be built. Community meetings were held to discuss issues related to the construction of the track and the local effects of events held. The local community largely supported construction of the speedway citing potentially increased land values and rejuvenation of the community. In April 1995, after having toured the sister track Michigan International Speedway, the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the project. The California Environmental Protection Agency gave Penske permission to begin construction after Kaiser agreed to pay US$6 million to remove hazardous waste from the site. Construction on the site began on November 22, 1995, with the demolition of the Kaiser Steel Mill. The water tower, a landmark of the Kaiser property, was preserved in the center of the track to be used as a scoreboard. of contaminated dirt was removed and transported to a toxic waste landfill. To prevent remaining impurities from rising to the surface, a cap of non-porous polyethylene was put down and covered with of clean soil. Construction of the track was completed in late 1996.

On January 10, 1997, Marlboro Team Penske&#x27;s driver Paul Tracy became the first driver to test on the new speedway. NASCAR held its first open test session on at the track from May 5–7. The official opening and ribbon cutting ceremony was held on June 20, 1997, with the first race, a NASCAR West Series race, being held the next day.

=== Auto Club Speedway ===
The track was named the California Speedway from the time it was built through February 21, 2008, when the Automobile Club of Southern California purchased the naming rights in a 10-year deal; thus the track became Auto Club Speedway and has remained as of 2023, as the deal was renewed. The sponsorship was discontinued after March of 2023.

=== Expansion and additions ===
With early success following the opening of the track, the speedway began to expand reserved grandstand seating along the front stretch with an additional 15,777 seats. In May 1999, an additional 28 skyboxes were added to the top of the main grandstand. In 2001 the Auto Club Dragway, a dragstrip, was built outside of the backstretch of the main speedway. That same year, the infield of the speedway was reconfigured to hold a multipurpose road course. On April 24, 2003, The San Bernardino County Planning Commission approved the changing of the speedway&#x27;s conditional use permit to allow the installation of lights around the track. Later that year NASCAR announced a second annual NASCAR Cup Series race at the track for the 2004 season, with the second race being run &quot;under the lights&quot;. NASCAR ran two weekends of racing annually until the 2011 season, when the track returned to a single annual race weekend.

In 2006, the speedway&#x27;s midway, located behind the main grandstand, was overhauled. The new midway, called the &quot;Discover IE FanZone&quot;, included the addition of Apex (a Wolfgang Puck restaurant), additional shade and lounge areas, a retail store and an entertainment stage.

In March 2014, the Las Vegas-based company Exotics Racing expanded to California by opening a new 1.2 mile road course at the Auto Club Speedway.

=== Configurations ===
=== Attendance problems ===

Upon the addition of a second NASCAR weekend at the track in 2004, attendance at the races dropped off dramatically, by as much as 20,000. With such a large attendance swing, drivers and media began to doubt if the track deserved two dates, even if the track was near Los Angeles, the nation&#x27;s second-largest media market. Weather also became a concern with either extremely hot days or with rain threatening the races. All of this factored into NASCAR&#x27;s decision to remove a second race from the track with the realignment of the 2011 NASCAR schedule. Former track owner Roger Penske said the track may be located in a one-race market. Track president Gillian Zucker cited bad weather windows and fans having other entertainment options as reasons for the attendance decline.

Effective in the 2014 racing season, the grandstand capacity was reduced from 92,000 to 68,000. This was accomplished by removing approximately 12,000 seats near turn 1 and installing a hospitality area and a digital display showing speeds along the straightaway. In addition, seats were further reduced as a result of modifying average seat width from 18 inches to 23 inches. The capacity quoted does not include luxury boxes and infield seating, which when added reaches a capacity of approximately 100,000.

=== Name change ===
On February 21, 2008, the Automobile Club of Southern California (ACSC) became the title sponsor of the raceway, making Auto Club Speedway the track&#x27;s official name. The naming rights deal was for ten years and is worth an estimated $50 to $75 million. In addition to naming rights, the ACSC was to have use of the facility for road tests for &quot;Westways&quot; magazine and other consumer tests. The money was used for capital improvements to the track.

=== In popular culture ===
The track was often used for filming television shows, commercials and films. In 2000, portions of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; were filmed at the speedway, and in 2005, portions of &quot;&quot; were filmed there. In 2007, &quot;The Bucket List&quot; saw Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman drive a vintage Shelby Mustang and Dodge Challenger around the speedway. The track was used as Daytona International Speedway in the 2019 film &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot;.

A parody of the track was used in the 2006 Disney/Pixar animated film &quot;Cars&quot; in the end of the film. It is the venue for the Piston Cup tiebreaker race between the movie&#x27;s main character Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), retiring veteran Strip &quot;The King&quot; Weathers (voiced by Richard Petty) and perennial runner-up Chick Hicks (voiced by Michael Keaton). The race is held at the Los Angeles International Speedway, which is a conglomeration of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena where the Rose Bowl is located, as well as the Auto Club Speedway.

=== Fatalities ===

During the 1999 Marlboro 500 CART race, Canadian driver Greg Moore died in a crash along the backstretch of the track. It was determined that after sliding along the infield grass, Moore&#x27;s car hit the edge of oncoming pavement, which caused the car to flip into a concrete retaining wall. The incident prompted the track owners, ISC, to pave the backstretch of both Auto Club Speedway and its sister track Michigan International Speedway in an attempt to prevent a similar accident. Shortly after the crash, CART mandated the use of a head-and-neck restraint system on all ovals. The rule eventually became mandatory on all tracks.

On April 5, 2002, Ricky Lundgren was killed in a qualifying session for a motorcycle race.

On August 7, 2004, a police officer from San Diego, John Barr, died during an open track event after coming off his motorcycle.

On June 2, 2005, two men died while participating in an event sponsored by the San Diego Chapter of the Ferrari Club of America.

On October 15, 2010, a 24-year-old woman died while participating in a driving school at the track. The woman was driving a replica Indycar as part of the Mario Andretti Racing Experience when she lost control and hit the inside wall of the track.

=== Planned reconstruction ===
On September 8, 2020, it was revealed that documents for the reconstruction of the facility as a half-mile high banked oval had been filed with San Bernardino County. As first reported by &quot;The Insider&quot;, the new short track layout would feature long straightaways like Martinsville Speedway and high banked turns like those featured at Bristol Motor Speedway. According to the published preliminary site plan, the new layout would fit inside the footprint of the current layout&#x27;s trioval, and utilize much of the existing infrastructure such as the garages (which would be outside the new track), main grandstand and pit road suites (which would overlook the relocated backstretch). The work was scheduled to start after the 2021 Auto Club 400, and to be completed in time for the 2022 season.

In December 2020, it was announced that the 2021 race weekend had been cancelled due to complications surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. On February 27, 2022, Auto Club Speedway president Dave Allen announced on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio that plans to convert the speedway had been put on hold. With the Busch Light Clash now being held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum beginning in 2022, there was now no official commitment from NASCAR to follow through with plans to convert the speedway. In early 2023, following the Busch Light Clash at The Coliseum, NASCAR chief operating officer Steve O&#x27;Donnell made mention that NASCAR was, &quot;evaluating the market as a whole and what&#x27;s the best place for us to race within the totality of 2024 and beyond.&quot;

In 2023, the track was closed for reconstruction as part of the Next Gen California racing project. Demolition began in October 2023.

<text>Lisieux () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. It is the capital of the Pays d&#x27;Auge area, which is characterised by valleys and hedged farmland.

==Name==
The name of the town derives from the (&quot;Noviomagus of the Lexovii&quot;). The town was originally known in Celtic as (&quot;New Field&quot;, &quot;New Market&quot;), which was Latinized as . Owing to the large number of similarly named cities, however, it was necessary to specify where this one was located. The local French demonym derives from the Latin as well.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Lisieux was the capital of the Lexovii. In his work, &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot;, Caesar mentions a Gallic &quot;oppidum&quot;, a term which refers to Celtic towns located on the tops of hills. The oppidum has been pinpointed to a place referred to as &quot;le Castellier&quot;, located to the southwest of the town. However the Gallo-Roman city was in fact located where Lisieux is to be found today.

===Middle Ages===
Lisieux was an important center of power in medieval times. The bishopric of Lisieux controlled most of the Pays d&#x27;Auge by the 12th century. King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine are thought to have married at Lisieux in 1152, and the town remained powerful for several centuries afterwards, until, in the 14th century, the triple scourges of the Plague, war and resulting famine devastated Lisieux and reduced its influence. The main judge of Joan of Arc, Pierre Cauchon, became a bishop of Lisieux after Joan&#x27;s death, and is buried in the Lady Chapel of the cathedral.

===Events===

* 4th century: Presence of the Germanic &quot;laeti&quot;, auxiliaries of the Roman Army, who settled in Lisieux with their families. Their graves have been discovered in the “Michelet” necropolis, some of which contain artefacts typical of northern Germania.
* 1432: Pierre Cauchon, the supreme judge during the trial of Joan of Arc at Rouen became the bishop of Lisieux. He commissioned the building of the side chapel of the cathedral, in which he is now buried.
* 1590: During the Eighth War of Religion, Henri IV had to fight to win back his kingdom. When he arrived at Lisieux he took the town without force, after the garrison had fled the town.
* 1897: Sister Thérèse of the Child Jesus of the Holy Face, died in the Carmelite monastery at Lisieux. In 1925, she would be canonized as &quot;St. Thérèse of Lisieux&quot;. 
* 1907: The first helicopter flight, piloted by Paul Cornu.
* 1937: Monseigneur Eugenio Pacelli, papal legate and future Pope Pius XII, visited Lisieux.
* 6/7 June 1944: An Allied bombardment killed 800 people and destroyed two thirds of the town.
* 23 August 1944: Liberation by the Allied troops.
* 1960: Lisieux merged with the &quot;Saint-Jacques&quot; commune.
* 2 June 1980: Pope John-Paul II visited Lisieux.

==Geography==
Lisieux is situated on the confluence of the river Touques and many of its tributaries: the rivers Orbiquet, Cirieux and Graindain.

The town is in the heart of the Pays d&#x27;Auge, of which it is the capital. Lisieux is therefore surrounded by Normandy&#x27;s typical hedged farmland, where there is a mix of livestock farming (mostly milk cows) and cider apple cultivation (from which cider and calvados are made, not forgetting pommeau).

===Climate===
Lisieux has a temperate oceanic humid climate.

===Transport===
The town of Lisieux is served by a bus network called Lexobus, with 6 routes. The town is also linked to surrounding towns and villages by a network of buses; Bus Verts du Calvados.
The main railway station, Lisieux station, which is the connecting station between the Paris-Cherbourg and Paris-Trouville/Deauville main lines, is served by Transport express régional (regional express) trains on the TER Normandie routes. The station appeared in the film &quot;Un singe en hiver&quot; by Henri Verneuil. There is another station on the line to Deauville: Le Grand-Jardin station.

To reach the town by car, the D613 (formerly route nationale 13) from Paris to Cherbourg crosses the town from east to west. The second main road serving Lisieux is the D579, leading to Deauville to the north and the department of Orne to the south. Lisieux benefits from a bypass, built in the 1990s, running to the south of the town, easing traffic in the town-centre, particularly on boulevard Sainte-Anne.

===Religion===

Since the Middle Ages Lisieux has been the seat of one of the seven Roman Catholic dioceses of Normandy under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical province of Rouen. The bishopric was abolished in 1801 before being recreated and merged with that of Bayeux in 1855, under the new name of &quot;Bayeux and Lisieux&quot;.

The best-known of the Bishops of Lisieux is Pierre Cauchon, who had a decisive influence during the trial of Joan of Arc. He is buried in Lisieux Cathedral.

Devotion to Sainte-Thérèse also known as St. Teresa of the Child Jesus who lived in the nearby Carmelite convent has made Lisieux France&#x27;s second-most important site of pilgrimage, after the Pyrenean town of Lourdes. Sainte-Thérèse de Lisieux died in 1897, she was canonized in 1925 and named a doctor of the church by Pope John Paul II in 1997.

==Administration==

===Mayors of Lisieux===
List of everyone who has held the position of Mayor of Lisieux:

===International relations===
Lisieux is twinned with:
* Taunton – since 1951;
* Saint-Georges, Quebec – since 1996
* Saint-Jérôme, Quebec – since 2010
* Mogliano Veneto 

==Population==
, Lisieux is Calvados&#x27; third largest commune in terms of population, after Caen and Hérouville-Saint-Clair. Its functional urban area of 55,168 inhabitants is the second largest of the department, after Caen. The inhabitants of Lisieux are known as &quot;Lexoviens&quot;.

==Sights==
About 60 percent of the town was destroyed in 1944, so few of the monuments have been preserved.

===Basilica of Sainte-Thérèse de Lisieux===

The Basilica of Sainte-Thérèse de Lisieux was constructed in honour of Sainte-Thérèse de Lisieux, who was beatified in 1923 and canonized in 1925. It was built for pilgrims who came in increasing numbers to venerate the new saint in the town where she had lived and died.

===Carmel of Lisieux===
It is possible to visit the chapel and exterior of the Carmel or monastery where Thérèse lived, but the remainder of the building is closed to visitors.

===Château de Saint-Germain-de-Livet===
As its name indicates, the Château de Saint-Germain-de-Livet is situated in the commune of Saint-Germain-de-Livet. It is to be found opposite the village church which dates from the 19th century. The château has been owned by the town of Lisieux since 1958 when it was donated by the Riesener family.

From an architectural point of view the château comprises a half-timbered manor dating from the 15th century and a glazed brick and stone building from the Pré-d&#x27;Auge dating from the end of the 16th century.

The chateau combines medieval and Renaissance elements and is surrounded by a moat and a peacock garden.

===Lisieux Cathedral===

Lisieux Cathedral () is a rare monument which survived the 1944 allied bombardment. Even though the cathedral has been around since the 6th century, the church of today must have been constructed between 1160 and 1230 by Bishop Arnoul.

From the outset, the architect designed quadripartite rib vaults and flying buttresses, making it one of Normandy&#x27;s first Gothic buildings. The nave is fairly austere and is inspired by the Gothic style of the Île de France, whereas the most recent parts of the building were constructed in the 18th century (the chevet, the lantern tower and the western façade) in Norman style.

It is wrongly claimed that Henry Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, Duke of Normandy and future king of England, married Eleanor of Aquitaine at the cathedral in 1152; they married in Poitiers Cathedral. Having been involved in the trial of Joan of Arc, Pierre Cauchon was named as Bishop of Lisieux in 1432 and is buried there.

===Town Hall===
The town hall (18th century) was formerly a private residence.

===Bishop&#x27;s Garden===
French formal garden of the former Bishop&#x27;s residence, designed by Andre le Notre, recreated in 1837.

<text>The original face is a term in Zen Buddhism, pointing to one&#x27;s real essence or Buddha-nature, one&#x27;s &#x27;real face&#x27;.

== Origins ==
The phrase &quot;original face&quot; originates in Huangbo&#x27;s Chuanhsin fayao (857) and the Hui-sin edition (967) of the Platform Sutra:
This question appears in case 23 of the Mumonkan:
This koan is transformed in the question

== Interpretation ==
According to Victor Hori, the &quot;original face&quot; points to &quot;the nonduality of subject and object&quot;:
Comparable statements are: &quot;Look at the flower and the flower also looks&quot;; &quot;Guest and host interchange&quot;.

According to Victor Hori, it is not &quot;pure consciousness&quot;, as it is often understood in western thinking, reached by &quot;cleaning the doors of perception&quot;:
== Comments ==
Zen masters have commented on the original face:



== Artistic impressions ==

=== Philip Whalen ===
The American poet Philip Whalen has written a poem, &quot;Metaphysical Insomnia Jazz Mumonkan xxix&quot;, inspired by the Original Face-koan:
Keith Kumasen has commented on this poem.

=== Stuart Davis ===
The American Buddhist musician Stuart Davis has recorded a song called &quot;Original Face&quot;. The chorus goes:
