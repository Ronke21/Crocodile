<text>Roberto Críspulo Goizueta Cantera (November 18, 1931 – October 18, 1997) was a Cuban-born American business executive who served as the chairman, president, and chief executive officer (CEO) of The Coca-Cola Company from August 1980 until his death in October 1997.

==Early life==
Goizueta was born on November 18, 1931, in Havana, Cuba. He was the only son of Críspulo Goizueta and Aída Cantera. His grandparents on both sides of his family had emigrated from Spain to Cuba in the late 19th century. His mother&#x27;s father, Marcelo Cantera, owned a portion of a profitable, local sugar mill. His father, Críspulo, was an architect and a real estate investor who inherited Cantera&#x27;s sugar interests.

Goizueta attended Colegio de Belén in Havana, a Jesuit secondary school and later studied for a year in the United States at the Cheshire Academy, a preparatory school in Connecticut. He graduated from Yale University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering in 1953.

==Career==
Goizueta returned to Cuba to work in his family&#x27;s business in 1953. A year later, Goizueta replied to a help wanted newspaper ad for a job with the Coca-Cola bottler in Cuba. A short time later, he was promoted to chief technical director of five Cuban bottling plants. 

Fidel Castro rose to power in Cuba, transforming the island into a communist state. While on vacation in Miami, Goizueta and his family decided to defect to the United States. After defecting to the United States, he worked for The Coca-Cola Company in Miami. He was reassigned to Nassau, Bahamas as a chemist for the Caribbean region. In 1964, he was moved to the headquarters of the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of 35, he became vice president of technical research and development. He remains the youngest person to hold this position at the company. In 1975, he was promoted to lead the legal and external affairs department.

He received an appointment in 1979, to become president of the Coca-Cola Company after the resignation of J. Lucian Smith, who was Coca-Cola&#x27;s president from 1974 until 1979. In March 1981, he assumed the chairmanship after chairman J. Paul Austin (who was Coca-Cola&#x27;s president from 1962–1971) retired. He remained at the helm of The Coca-Cola Company for 16 years until the time of his death, due to complications from lung cancer, in 1997. During his tenure, the Coca-Cola brand became the best-known trademark in the world. In 1982, he introduced Diet Coke, followed by Cherry Coke and the controversial New Coke, both in 1985; advertising slogans &quot;Coke is it!&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Beat the Feeling&quot; and &quot;Always Coca-Cola&quot;. In 1982, Goizueta approved the purchase of Columbia Pictures, signaling Coca-Cola&#x27;s intentions to branch out beyond the soft-drink business. 

Goizueta also sat on the boards of directors for various companies, including SunTrust Banks, the Ford Motor Company, Sonat Inc and the Eastman Kodak Company. He was well known for his business rivalry with fellow businessman Roger Enrico, CEO of PepsiCo, during his tenure as Coke&#x27;s CEO.

==Philanthropy==
Roberto Goizueta established the Goizueta Foundation, with a goal to support educational and charity institutions in 1992. &quot;The purpose of the Goizueta Foundation is to assist organizations that empower individuals and families through educational opportunities to improve the quality of their lives.&quot;

In 1994, after a $10 million gift from the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, the Board of Trustees at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, named its business school after Roberto Goizueta. The school grants BBAs, MBAs, and PhDs in business. Emory University has an extensive history with Coca-Cola. In 1899, Methodist Bishop Warren Candler&#x27;s brother Asa Candler was elected to Emory&#x27;s Board of Trustees and was a generous patron of the university.

In January 1999, the estate of Goizueta pledged $20 million to Emory University.

==Personal life==
Goizueta married Olguita Casteleiro in Havana, Cuba. They had four children together. 

==Death==
A heavy smoker, Goizueta died on October 18, 1997 of lung cancer.

<text>The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) is a consortium of universities and other institutions that operates astronomical observatories and telescopes. 

Founded October 10, 1957, with the encouragement of the National Science Foundation (NSF), AURA was incorporated by a group of seven U.S. universities: California, Chicago, Harvard, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio State, and Wisconsin. The first meeting of the board of directors took place in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Today, AURA has 47 member institutions in the United States and 3 international affiliate members.

AURA began as a small organization dedicated to ground-based optical astronomy, managing a range of 1- to 4-meter telescopes and providing community advocacy for optical/infrared astronomy. Over the years, AURA expanded its focus to include Solar Astronomy and the Gemini 8-meter telescopes, going on to partner with other consortia such as WIYN (Wisconsin Indiana Yale &amp; NOAO) and SOAR (Southern Astrophysical Research). In the 1980s, AURA took on the management of the Space Telescope Science Institute, opening up the ultraviolet, optical, and infrared wavelength bands in space with the Hubble Space Telescope and in infrared space astronomy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

AURA is responsible for the successful management and operation of its three centers: NSF’s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab); the NSF&#x27;s National Solar Observatory (NSO); and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).

==Centers==
*NSF’s NOIRLab is the US national center for ground-based, nighttime optical astronomy. The mission of NOIRLab is to enable breakthrough discoveries in astrophysics by developing and operating state-of-the-art ground-based observatories and providing data products and services for a diverse and inclusive community. Through its five Programs — Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), the Community Science and Data Center (CSDC), International Gemini Observatory, Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) and Vera C. Rubin Observatory — NSF’s NOIRLab serves as a focal point for community development of innovative scientific programs, the exchange of ideas, and creative development. 
*NSF&#x27;s National Solar Observatory (NSO) - AURA operates NSO which is located in Boulder, Colorado and at the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) in Maui, Hawaii.
*Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) - AURA manages STScI for NASA to carry out the science mission of the Hubble Space Telescope and to carry out the operations and science missions of the James Webb Space Telescope.
&quot;Construction project: The Vera C.Rubin Observatory&quot; - a public-private partnership to operate an 8.4-meter telescope on Chile’s Cerro Pachon.

==President==

Dr. Matt Mountain was appointed president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) on 1 March 2015. The president, as the chief executive officer, serves as the primary representative or spokesperson for AURA. The president is a member of the board of directors and implements policy decisions of the board. The president serves the board of directors as its principal executive officer, providing leadership and guidance on policy matters, coordinating the activities of the board and its various committees. The president is also responsible for maintaining effective working relationships with AURA Member Universities.

==AURA Board of Directors==
The board, which meets quarterly, establishes the policies of AURA, approves its budget, elects members of the Management Councils, and appoints the president, the center directors, and other principal officers. The board of directors is responsible to the member representatives for the effective management of AURA and the achievement of its purposes.

==Members==
Today, there are 47 U.S. Member Institutions and 3 International Affiliate Members which comprise the Member Institutions of AURA. The president of each member institution designates a member representative who has a voice in AURA matters. Together, the member representatives act upon membership applications.

<text>The River is a 1984 American drama film directed by Mark Rydell, written by Robert Dillon and Julian Barry, and starring Sissy Spacek, Mel Gibson, and Scott Glenn. The film tells the story of a struggling farm family in a Tennessee river valley trying to keep its farm from going under in the face of bank foreclosures and floods. The father faces the dilemma of having to work as a strikebreaker in a steel mill to keep his family farm from foreclosure. It was based on the true story of farmers who unknowingly took jobs as strikebreakers at a steel mill after their crops had been destroyed by rain.

&quot;The River&quot; was theatrically released on December 19, 1984, by Universal Pictures. It received mixed reviews, with critics praising Spacek&#x27;s performance and the cinematography, but criticizing the screenplay, execution, and Gibson&#x27;s performance, whom many considered to have been miscast. It was a box office failure, grossing only $11.5 million against an $18 million budget. Despite that, it received four nominations at the 57th Academy Awards; Best Actress (for Spacek), Best Original Score, Best Sound, Best Cinematography, and won the Special Achievement Award.

==Plot==

Tom and Mae Garvey are a hard-working couple living with their two children on the east Tennessee farm owned by Tom&#x27;s family for generations. They and many of their neighbors have hit hard times as of late. A downturn in the economy has led to dwindling land prices.

Their biggest problem has been that their crop land has been prone to flooding as the property is adjacent to a river. Manipulating the powers that be include local senator Neiswinder and the local bank. Joe Wade, who also grew up in the area and now runs the local milling company that sets the local grain prices, is secretly working to buy up the properties along the river so he can build a dam. The dam would generate electricity but more importantly for Wade, it would provide irrigation opportunities for farm properties away from the river, such as his own.

Wade&#x27;s maneuverings coupled with many other farming problems makes it increasingly difficult for Tom and Mae to hold on to their farm. Tom is determined at any cost stay on the land of his ancestors. Through his cousin, Tom begins work at a steel factory in order to prevent foreclosure on his farm, only finding out he&#x27;s a strikebreaker as they&#x27;re crossing the picket lines. Work in the mill is incredibly hard, the conditions are tough and pay is meager.

The rest of the Garvey family is left alone while Tom is away working. Mae is involved in an accident on the farm where she loses a lot of blood and almost her arm. Some time later, Tom invites his family to come visit him in the city where he and Mae compare how things are going in their daily lives now spent apart. The strike ends, but as part of the returning workers&#x27; deal, the strike breakers must walk out of the factory without the protection they had when entering. Instead of an all-out fight, the workers and scabs observe one another, recognizing each others&#x27; desperation before the workers begin shaming the scabs.

Tom returns to the farm and is pleased with the crops but Wade has Tom&#x27;s corn inspected. Wade offers less than what the crop cost Tom to plant which leads to a confrontation where Wade reveals his plans for a hydroelectric dam and the redevelopment of Tom&#x27;s land. Tom returns to the farm where his machinery is failing and another flood threatens the farm.

An exhausted Mae finally confronts Tom over his stubbornness, as he is continuing to fight a losing battle with Wade and the river. The farming community bands together to build a levee providing some relief. Wade arrives with a truck full of bankrupt farmers intent on dismantling the levee for cash. Wade offers the farmers on Tom&#x27;s side a bonus if they sabotage the levee. Tom pleads with both sides, many of whom were in Tom&#x27;s shoes but lost their farms, however the levee is breached and the floodwaters flow in. Despite all of this, Tom begins picking up sandbags to repair the levee alone. Inspired by his dedication, his family and eventually, the onlookers help Tom repair the levee. Wade realizes he&#x27;s lost the battle and admires Tom&#x27;s determination, but points out that sooner or later nature will upend Tom&#x27;s farm and Wade will be waiting.

The Garvey family has a successful harvest.

==Cast==

* Sissy Spacek as Mae Garvey
* Mel Gibson as Tom Garvey
* Shane Bailey as Lewis Garvey
* Becky Jo Lynch as Beth Garvey
* Scott Glenn as Joe Wade
* Don Hood as Senator Neiswinder
* Billy &quot;Green&quot; Bush as Harve Stanley

==Production==
Director Mark Rydell viewed the characters in this drama as iconicly American, and he was eager to cast Sissy Spacek as the farm wife because of her performance in &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and her home on a farm near Charlottesville, Virginia. Rydell said, &quot;She is the consummate American rural young woman, with strength and fiber and a luminous quality.&quot; Mel Gibson begged Rydell to let him play the Tennessee farmer who reminded him of his father, but the director was reluctant because of Gibson&#x27;s Australian accent. Before Gibson left for England to film &quot;The Bounty&quot;, he begged Rydell not to cast the part yet. Rydell recalled, &quot;He came back to my house in Los Angeles and started reading the script, talking, reading the newspaper, in this perfect Tennessee accent. I was really impressed, even when he stood next to Sissy, who&#x27;s like a tuning fork when it comes to accents, he had damn well done it.&quot;

&quot;The River&quot; was filmed in the Holston Valley area of Church Hill, Tennessee. The filmmakers purchased along the Holston River for the farm set and planted corn. Most of the filming was done along Goshen Valley Road and around the Goshen Valley Park area. Goshen Valley Road heads south from highway 11W in Church Hill, Tennessee. The cast and their families moved to the area a month before the start of production to connect with the local people and learn farming skills. The floods in the film were supplied by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Army Corps of Engineers with water from the Fort Patrick Henry Dam. The bank and downtown scenes were filmed in the town of Gate City, Virginia. The tent city and a few other scenes were filmed in Kingsport, Tennessee, while some factory scenes were filmed in Birmingham, Alabama. Scenes that were filmed at Double Springs Baptist Church in Jonesborough, Tennessee did not make the final cut of the movie. The film was completed for under $18 million.

==Music==
The musical score was composed and conducted by John Williams and also featured songs by country artists including George Strait.

It was announced that Intrada Records will release an expanded and remastered version of Williams&#x27; score on May 5, 2020. The new release will feature the complete score (including previous and unheard content) and the original soundtrack album.

==Reception==

&quot;The River&quot; was the last of three 1984 films, including &quot;Country&quot; and &quot;Places in the Heart&quot;, that shared the themes of a family&#x27;s devotion to their farm, the destructive force of nature, an unsympathetic bureaucracy and a determined woman who binds her family together.

The film received negative reviews, with praise for Sissy Spacek&#x27;s performance being a notable exception. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 27% on Rotten Tomatoes from 22 critics. Mel Gibson later regretted that his portrayal of Tom Garvey was so stubborn that the audience lost sympathy, and said that he had been miscast for the role because he was too young and &quot;pretty&quot; at the time.

The film opened Wednesday, December 19, 1984, in 3 theaters and grossed $40,540 in its first seven days to Christmas Day and went on to gross $11.5 million in the United States and Canada.

==Awards==
The film was nominated for Academy Awards in Best Actress in a Leading Role (Sissy Spacek), Best Cinematography, Best Music, Original Score and Best Sound (Nick Alphin, Robert Thirlwell, Richard Portman and David M. Ronne). It also received a special Oscar for sound effects editing (Kay Rose).

<text>The Blephariceromorpha are an infraorder of nematoceran flies, including three families associated with fast-flowing, high-mountain streams, where the larvae can be found.

One recent classification based largely on fossils splits this group into two infraorders, and removes the Nymphomyiidae to its own suborder, but this has not gained wide acceptance. More recently, the family Blephariceridae has been considered a member of the infraorder Psychodomorpha, with Deuterophlebiidae and Nymphomyiidae either assigned their own infraorders or left unassigned to infraorder. The placement of these three families remains controversial.

<text>Sir David Hamilton (born 24 October 1950) is a Scottish Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Midlothian from 2001 to 2015.

==Background==

David Hamilton was born in Dalkeith, Midlothian, and was educated at the local Dalkeith High School. In 1965, on leaving school, he worked as a miner with the National Coal Board for nineteen years, and remained a member of the National Union of Mineworkers until 1988. He was remanded in custody for two months during the 1984–1985 miners&#x27; strike for an alleged assault on a Dalkeith man; although bail was denied many times, he was acquitted at trial. Hamilton later claimed he had been &quot;fitted up&quot; by the police and security services. He worked as an employment training supervisor with Midlothian District Council for two years from 1987, and was appointed as a placement officer for the Craigmillar Festival Society in 1989, becoming the chief executive of Craigmillar Opportunities 1992–2000.

==Political career==

He was elected as a Midlothian Councillor in 1995, serving for six years. He was elected to the House of Commons at the 2001 general election for Midlothian following the retirement of Eric Clarke. Hamilton held the seat with a majority of 9,014 before deciding to step down before the 2015 general election. He made his maiden speech on 12 July 2001, in which he remembered one of his predecessors as the Midlothian MP and former Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone.

He is a member of the left-wing Socialist Campaign Group, and in 2003 became a member of both the Scottish affairs and the work and pensions select committees until the 2005 general election, since when he has been a member of the defence and European legislation committees.

He was also a member of the Public Bill Committee for the Defence Reform Act 2014.

In January 2015, he announced that he would not contest the Midlothian seat at the upcoming election. The Scottish National Party candidate Owen Thompson went on to win the Midlothian seat in 2015 with a 9,859 majority. This win, following national trends, was a huge swing of +30% to the SNP.

Hamilton was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for political and parliamentary service.

==Personal life==

He has been married to Jean Trench Macrae since 1969 and they have two daughters. He takes a keen interest in biotechnology.

<text>The Tipulomorpha are an infraorder of Nematocera, containing the crane flies, a very large group, and allied families.

== Taxonomy ==

The Tipulomorpha comprise five extant families. 
*Tipulomorpha
**Tipuloidea (typical crane flies)
***Cylindrotomidae (long-bodied crane flies)
***Pediciidae (hairy-eyed crane flies)
***Limoniidae (limoniid crane flies) – probably paraphyletic

***Trichoceridae

===Extinct superfamilies===

One recent classification based largely on fossils splits this group into a series of extinct superfamilies (below), and includes members of other infraorders, but this has not gained wide acceptance.

*Superfamily Eopolyneuroidea
**Family Eopolyneuridae - (Upper Triassic)
**Family Musidoromimidae - (Upper Triassic)
*Superfamily Tipulodictyoidea extinct
**Family Tipulodictyidae - (Upper Triassic)
*Superfamily Tanyderophryneoidea extinct
**Family Tanyderophryneidae - (Middle Jurassic)

<doc id="643201" wikidata="Q184284" url="?curid=643201" title="Cederberg">
<text>The Cederberg mountains are located near Clanwilliam, approximately 300 km north of Cape Town, South Africa at about . The mountain range is named after the endangered Clanwilliam cedar (&quot;Widdringtonia cedarbergensis&quot;), which is a tree endemic to the area. The mountains are noted for dramatic rock formations and San rock art. The Cederberg Wilderness Area is administered by CapeNature.

&quot;Cederberg&quot; is now the generally accepted spelling for the area, which combines the English (Cedarberg) and Afrikaans (Sederberg) variants.

==Geography and climate==
The Cederberg mountains extend about 50 km north–south by 20 km east–west. They are bordered on the west by the Sandveld, the north by the Pakhuis Mountains, the east by the Springbok Flats and the south by the Kouebokkeveld Mountains and the Skurweberge. The main access road, the N7, runs to the west of the range. The nearest towns are Citrusdal to the southwest and Clanwilliam to the north. The area is sparsely populated.

There are several notable mountains in the range, including Sneeuberg (2026 m) and Tafelberg (1969 m). Tafelberg (Afrikaans for &quot;Table Mountain&quot;) should not be confused with the Table Mountain in Cape Town. Notable landmarks include the Maltese Cross, Wolfberg Arch and Wolfberg Cracks.

The dominating characteristic of the area is sharply defined sandstone rock formations (Table Mountain Group), often reddish in colour. This group of rocks contains bands of shale and in recent years a few important fossils have been discovered in these argillaceous layers. The fossils are of primitive fish and date back 450 million years to the Ordovician Period.

The summers are very hot and dry, while the winters are wetter and cold with typical annual rainfall in the low-lying areas of less than 700 mm. The higher peaks receive a dusting of snow in winter. Summer days are typically clear and cloudless. Due to the clear skies most of the year, it makes an excellent site for skywatching and has its own amateur observatory.

==Flora and fauna==
The predominant vegetation is Mediterranean fynbos in the wetter south and west, changing to semi desert scrub in the north and east. The endangered Clanwilliam cedar (&quot;Widdringtonia wallichii&quot;) of the family Cupressaceae and the snow protea (&quot;Protea cryophila&quot;) of the Proteaceae are endemic to the area, found only in more remote areas high up in the mountains.

The area&#x27;s apex predators are the felids leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;) and caracal (&quot;Caracal caracal&quot;). Other mammals include the rock hyrax (&quot;Procavia capensis&quot;) or &quot;dassie&quot;, meerkats (&quot;Suricata suricatta&quot;) and other mongooses (Herpestidae), larger antelopes (e.g. bontebok &quot;Damaliscus pygargus dorcas&quot; and gemsbok &quot;Oryx gazella&quot;), the vulnerable Cape mountain zebra (&quot;Equus zebra zebra&quot;), and chacma baboons (&quot;Papio ursinus&quot;). There are also many birds, small mammals, reptiles and insects.

Other threatened species found in the Cederberg Wilderness Area include the cyprinids Clanwilliam yellowfish (&quot;Labeobarbus capensis&quot;, vulnerable), Clanwilliam redfin (&quot;Barbus calidus&quot;, vulnerable) and sawfin (&quot;Barbus serra&quot;, endangered).

==Human activity==

===Historical===
In caves and overhangs throughout the area, San rock art can be found, evidence of the earliest human inhabitants. European settlement brought forestry and some agriculture, and led to massive destruction of the local cedar trees, with thousands felled for telephone poles, furniture and housing. The European arrival also led to the elimination of the San population. In the north, the old Moravian mission station of Wupperthal still remains, the heart of a small subsistence farming community, and home to a local industry producing &quot;veldskoene&quot;, traditional soft leather shoes.

The Cederberg was possibly the southernmost battleground of the Second Boer War. A small band of Boer guerrillas penetrated into this area from the Boer republics, hundreds of kilometres to the north, hoping to stir up popular support amongst the local farmers of Dutch descent. In this they failed; the farmers may have had little sympathy for the British but they had a fair notion of who was going to win the war. It is said that the Boer commandos were confronted in the Cederberg by a lone Englishman, who ordered them to surrender. They laughed at him, because he was one and they were many and tried to reason with him, pointing out the hopelessness of his position. He refused to back down and was in the end shot dead. The place where he fell is today called &quot;Engelsmanskloof&quot; (&quot;Englishman&#x27;s ravine&quot;).

===Agriculture===
Arable land is limited by the altitude, the dry climate, and the rocky terrain, and few farms exist. Rooibos tea is the area&#x27;s most famous export, though fruit and tobacco are also harvested on some farms. The Cederberg area includes one winery, the highest in South Africa. Around the Wupperthal area are a number of subsistence farms. Some commercial pine plantations remain around the Algeria forest station. Proteas and other fynbos plants are also grown. A number of farms have become predominantly guest farms catering for the local and international tourist market.

===Tourism===

As a wilderness area, the primary activity is eco-tourism, including camping, rock climbing and hiking. The main campsite, Algeria, is operated by CapeNature, while others such as Sanddrif, Driehoek, Jamaka and Kromrivier are privately operated and form the Cedarberg Conservancy, a voluntary association of landowners.

The Cederberg is renowned for its quality of rock climbing routes particularly around the Krakadouw and Tafelberg peaks. The Table Mountain Sandstone creates ideal conditions for spectacular routes. There are numerous day and overnight hikes including the popular and spectacular Wolfberg Arch, Wolfberg Cracks and the Maltese Cross.

The area is also home to an amateur astronomical observatory, which regularly hosts open evenings for the public.

There are various 4x4 routes.

A large tract of the northern Cederberg is owned by the Moravian Church. The quaint village of Wupperthal forms part of a mission station route that provides visitors with an interesting view of rural life. The village is also a well known centre for hand-made leather shoes and boots. One of the &quot;buite stasies&quot; (directly translated as outer stations) is Heuningvlei, a small picturesque hamlet that is in the process of developing a donkey cart trail from the summit of Pakhuis Pass to the hamlet. The project, a poverty alleviation project funded by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, includes the creation of backpacking accommodation, herb garden and various other tourism offerings.

===Scouting===
The Cederberg is also the site of the Senior Scout Adventure, a 12-day event for Scouts run every second year by Scouts South Africa.

<doc id="643203" wikidata="Q719139" url="?curid=643203" title="Wessex culture">
<text>The Wessex culture is the predominant prehistoric culture of central and southern Britain during the early Bronze Age, originally defined by the British archaeologist Stuart Piggott in 1938.

The culture is related to the Hilversum culture of the southern Netherlands, Belgium and northern France, and linked to the Armorican Tumulus culture in northern France and the Unetice culture in central Germany. It is prototyped with the Middle Rhine group of the Bell Beaker culture and commonly subdivided in the consecutive phases of Wessex I (2000–1650 BC) and Wessex II (1650–1400). Piggott attributes the origin of this culture to an &quot;actual ethnic movement&quot; from Northern France. Piggott describes the culture as composed of an underlying substratum, similar to the contemporary food vessel culture found further north, and an intrusive ruling class who opened trading networks with France and central and northern Europe, and imported bronze tools and probably also artisans.

The first phase, Wessex I, is characterised by rich depositions in the graves of chieftains, including gold artifacts, and crouched inhumations under barrows (e.g. the Bush Barrow). This period is closely associated with the construction and use of the later phases of Stonehenge. The second phase, Wessex II, is characterised by less rich grave goods without gold and a resurgence of cremations, believed to be a return to the previous funerary practices of the British Neolithic. They appear to have had wide ranging trade links with continental Europe, importing amber from the Baltic, jewellery from modern day Germany, gold from Brittany as well as daggers and beads from Mycenaean Greece and vice versa. They produced characteristic pendants in the shape of halberds, with handles made from gold or amber, or a combination of these materials.

It has been speculated that river transport allowed Wessex to be the main link to the Severn estuary. The wealth from such trade probably permitted the Wessex people to construct the second and third (&quot;megalithic&quot;) phases of Stonehenge and also indicates a powerful form of social organisation.

When the term &#x27;Wessex Culture&#x27; was first coined, investigations into British prehistory were in their infancy and the unusually rich and well documented burials in the Wessex area loomed large in literature on the Bronze Age. During the twentieth century many more Bronze Age burials were uncovered and opinions about the nature of the early-mid Bronze Age shifted considerably. Since the late 20th century it has become customary to consider &#x27;Wessex Culture&#x27; as a limited social stratum rather than a distinct cultural grouping, specifically referring to the hundred or so particularly richly furnished graves in and around Wiltshire. The culture group, however, is named as one of the intrusive Beaker groups that appear in Ireland.

<doc id="643205" wikidata="Q55667960" url="?curid=643205" title="Grand Forks Herald">
<text>The Grand Forks Herald is a daily broadsheet newspaper, established in 1879, published in Grand Forks, North Dakota, United States. It is the primary daily paper for northeast North Dakota and northwest Minnesota. Its average daily circulation is approximately 7,500, in the city of Grand Forks plus about 7,500 more to the surrounding communities. Total circulation includes digital subscribers. It has the second largest circulation in the state of North Dakota.

==Grand Forks Herald Building==

The &quot;Grand Forks Herald&quot; won a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its coverage of the 1997 flood but the prize was bittersweet, as the &quot;Herald&quot; building had not only been inundated but burned to the ground in the midst of the floodwaters. Despite losing its offices during the flood, the &quot;Herald&quot; never missed a day of publication. Temporary offices were set up at the University of North Dakota and at a nearby elementary school. Papers were distributed free of charge to flood &quot;refugees&quot; in neighboring towns.

Following the flood, the newspaper rebuilt its office building in downtown Grand Forks. Its distinctive features are a tall clock tower and the symbolism built into the structure, as well as parts of the old building that survived the fire. A new printing facility was also built in an industrial park in the western part of Grand Forks.

The historic building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was a two-story Art Moderne brick commercial building built in three parts, in 1939 (designed by Theodore B. Wells), 1949 and 1959.

==Corporate ownership==
Knight Ridder sold the &quot;Herald&quot; to The McClatchy Company on June 27, 2006. McClatchy had already arranged the sale of the &quot;Herald&quot; to Forum Communications, owner of &quot;The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead&quot; and WDAZ-TV in Grand Forks. Today, the &quot;Herald&quot; is one of many regional newspapers published by Forum Communications. After the sale, the newspaper ended its carrier delivery service and reduced its print copy; it is only printed 2 days a week: Tuesdays and Saturdays.

<doc id="643206" wikidata="Q950698" url="?curid=643206" title="Culicomorpha">
<text>The Culicomorpha are an infraorder of Nematocera, including mosquitoes, black flies, and several extant and extinct families of insects. They originated 176 million years ago, in the Triassic period. There are phylogenetic patterns that are used to interpret bionomic features such as differences in the nature of blood-feeding by adult females, daytime or nighttime feeding by adult females, and occurrence of immature stages in aquatic habitats.

Most adult, females lay their eggs on bodies of water. Some are restricted to very clean waters, but others can tolerate highly polluted environments.

Many adults transmit parasites or diseases that can be debilitating or fatal to humans, such as malaria and West Nile virus. Biting midges can transmit an extensive range of pathogens of veterinary importance, including Akabane virus, bovine ephemeral fever virus, Schmallenberg virus, African horse sickness virus, epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus, and bluetongue virus.

==Classification==

The Culicomorpha comprises extant eight families divided into two superfamilies. It was described based on phylogenetic analyses of morphological features.

* Superfamily Culicoidea
** Dixidae -meniscus midges
** Corethrellidae -frog-biting midges
** Chaoboridae -phantom midges
** Culicidae -mosquitoes
* Superfamily Chironomoidea
** Thaumaleidae -solitary midges
** Simuliidae -black flies and buffalo gnats
** Ceratopogonidae -biting midges
** Chironomidae -nonbiting midges

The monophyly of Culicomorpha and Culicoidea have been confirmed in subsequent morphological and molecular studies, but several studies have found Chironomoidea to be paraphyletic. A morphological study in 2012, using characters from all life stages (egg, larva, pupae and adult), found that Chironomidae branched first and a sister relationship between Culicoidea and a clade of Simuliidae, Ceratopogonidae and Thamaleidae. A new superfamily, Simulioidea, was proposed for the latter clade and restricted Chironomoidea to Chironomidae. A phylogenomic analysis in 2018 also found a paraphyletic Chironomoidea and a close relationship between Simuliidae and Thamaleidae, but in this study Ceratopoginidae grouped with Chironomidae. The phylogenetic trees below illustrate the different arrangements.

===Extinct families===
* Asiochaoboridae (Upper Jurassic)
* Architendipedidae (Upper Triassic)
* Protendipedidae (Middle Jurassic)
* Mesophantasmatidae (Middle Jurassic)

<doc id="643207" wikidata="Q537747" url="?curid=643207" title="Burt Ward">
<text>Burt Ward (born Bert John Gervis Jr. ; July 6, 1945) is an American actor, animal welfare activist and businessman. He played Dick Grayson&#x27;s Robin, the sidekick of Batman (played by Adam West), in the television series &quot;Batman&quot; (1966–1968), its theatrical feature film, the Saturday morning animated series &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot; (1977), the two-episode pilot &quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot; (1979), the animated reunion films &quot;&quot; (2016) and &quot;Batman vs. Two-Face&quot; (2017), and the live-action television event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Ward was born Bert John Gervis Jr., on July 6, 1945, in Los Angeles, California. His father, Bert Gervis Sr., was the owner of a traveling ice show called &quot;Rhapsody On Ice&quot;. At age two, Ward was listed in the magazine &quot;Strange as It Seems&quot; as a professional ice skater. Growing up, he was an avid reader of comic books such as &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Superboy&quot;, and enjoyed the action-adventure show &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;. He acquired the nickname &quot;Sparky&quot; in his youth, possibly from the sparks his skates kicked up during his routines or his energetic nature.
He excelled in high school sport activities such as football, track, and wrestling; he was also a member of the chess club and is a practitioner of Taekwondo. After graduation, he enrolled in college while working part-time for his father&#x27;s real-estate company.

==Career==
In October 1965, Ward auditioned for the role of Robin. West and Ward were up against Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyell for the roles of Batman and Robin, respectively. Selected for the role of Robin, Ward thought people would find Gervis (the &quot;G&quot; is soft, as in &quot;gentleman&quot;) hard to pronounce and adopted his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Ward. He also changed the spelling of Bert to &quot;Burt&quot; to add &quot;punch&quot;.

Unlike the series&#x27; lead, Adam West, Ward was required to perform some dangerous stunt work. He was told this was because his costume revealed more of his face, making it impractical for all of his stunt scenes to be performed by a stunt double. Later, he also discovered that he was being paid the minimum wage allowed by the Screen Actors Guild, and his stunt double was paid per stunt, so having Ward perform his own stunts was a cost-saving strategy. Ward says that he was sent to the emergency room dozens of times during his time as Robin.

At the height of the series&#x27; popularity, Ward recorded several musical tracks during sessions produced by Tom Wilson and arranged by Frank Zappa. The first two, &quot;Boy Wonder, I Love You&quot; (which Zappa wrote) and &quot;Orange Colored Sky&quot;, were released as a single on November 14, 1966. Two other tracks from these sessions, &quot;Teenage Bill of Rights&quot; and &quot;Autumn Love&quot;, remain unreleased.

During the first months of shooting, Ward was paid $350 per week. The series only lasted three seasons, for a total of 120 episodes; according to Ward in an interview, this was because of the high cost of production. It was still high in the ratings, but ABC was losing money. Later, NBC offered to pick it up for a fourth season, but the offer was withdrawn after learning that the sets had been destroyed. West and Ward also played Batman and Robin in the 20th Century Fox film &quot;Batman: The Movie&quot; released on July 30, 1966.

In 1969, a year after &quot;Batman&quot;&#x27;s cancellation, West&#x27;s mother died, bringing the two men closer together. They were reunited many times at conventions and TV reunion specials. In turn, Ward also made three guest appearances with West on separate cartoons: one was a 2002 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, later in 2010 on an episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, and in 2013 for one of the final episodes of &quot;Futurama&quot;. West and Ward remained friends until West&#x27;s death on June 9, 2017, at age 88. 

===Post-&quot;Batman&quot; career===

After the end of &quot;Batman&quot;, Ward, like Adam West, found himself hard-pressed to find other acting jobs. He did act in more than 40 made-for-television films such as &quot;Virgin High&quot;.

In 1985, DC Comics named Ward as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th-anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot; for his work on the Batman series.

In June 1995, Ward wrote a tell-all autobiography called &quot;Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights&quot;, which described his time playing Robin.

Ward appeared in numerous reunions with co-star Adam West. The most memorable included reprising their roles as the Dynamic Duo on a short-lived animated series called &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot;, as well as &quot;The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour&quot; and &quot;Tarzan and the Super 7&quot;. In addition, they reappeared as the Dynamic Duo for &quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot;. West and Ward finally reunited in the 2003 television movie, &quot;Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt&quot;.

During a &quot;Pro Wrestling Unplugged&quot; angle with wrestler Johnny Kashmere, Ward &quot;knighted&quot; Kashmere as the &quot;New Batman&quot;. Ward has appeared on the show several times, walking out to the theme music from the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot;.

In 2001, Ward established the now-closed Boy Wonder Visual Effects, Inc.

In 2012, Bluewater comics was planning to issue a four-issue comic miniseries in homage to Burt Ward playing Robin, called &quot;Burt Ward, Boy Wonder&quot;, but it was apparently canceled. It starred Burt Ward and his crimefighting rescue dogs Gentle and Giant fighting crime. Part of the first issue was released on Free Comic Book Day 2012.

Beginning in late 2017, Ward is seen promoting the &quot;Batman&quot; television series and other classic television series on the MeTV television network.

In 2016 and 2017 respectively, West and Ward reunited a final time, to reprise the Dynamic Duo in the animated movies &quot;&quot; and &quot;Batman vs. Two-Face&quot;, the latter being released after West&#x27;s death.

On January 9, 2020, Ward received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Charity work==
In 1994, Ward and his wife, Tracy Posner Ward, founded a charitable organization called Gentle Giants Rescue and Adoptions, Inc., which rescues giant-breed dogs such as Great Danes and some smaller-breed dogs. Their work with the organization has been featured in such outlets as &quot;People&quot; magazine, ASPCA Animal Watch, &quot;Hard Copy&quot;, &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. Ward was also seen in an episode of Animal Planet&#x27;s &quot;Adoption Tales&quot;.

==Business activity==
Burt has also created a company, Gentle Giants, which sells dog and cat food.

==Personal life==
Ward&#x27;s first wife was Bonney Lindsey, daughter of conductor Mort Lindsey. Ward and Lindsey married on July 19, 1965, and divorced in 1967. They had one daughter in 1966. From 1967 to 1969, he was married to actress Kathy Kersh, whom he met when she appeared as a guest villainess on the &quot;Batman&quot; television series. He was married to model Mariana Torchia from 1985 to 1989. Since 1990, Ward has been married to Tracy Posner. Their daughter was born on February 16, 1991.

<text>The Bibionomorpha are an infraorder of the suborder Nematocera. One of its constituent families, the Anisopodidae, is the presumed sister taxon to the entire suborder Brachycera. Several of the remaining families in the infraorder (those shown without common names) are former subfamilies of the Mycetophilidae, which has been recently subdivided. The family Axymyiidae has recently been removed from the Bibionomorpha to its own infraorder Axymyiomorpha.

Most representatives of the Bibionomorpha are saprophages or fungivores as larvae with the Cecidomyiidae being predominantly gall-formers. Some sciarids are common indoor pests, developing large populations in potting soil that has become moldy from overwatering. The larvae of the Bibionidae sometimes migrate in large, snake-like masses to minimize dehydration while seeking a new feeding site.

<doc id="643214" wikidata="Q3030327" url="?curid=643214" title="Tony Armas Jr.">
<text>Antonio José Armas (born April 29, 1978), better known as Tony Armas Jr., is a Venezuelan former professional baseball right-handed pitcher. He spent most of his active career with the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball (MLB).

==Professional career==

===New York Yankees===
Armas was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1994.

===Boston Red Sox===
Armas and a player to be named later (Jim Mecir), were traded to the Boston Red Sox in 1997 for Mike Stanley and Randy Brown.

===Montréal Expos/Washington Nationals===
He was sent to the Montréal Expos in 1997 along with pitcher Carl Pavano in exchange for Pedro Martínez.

Various injuries held him back until 2003, when he was the team&#x27;s Opening Day starter, shutting down the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field, 10–2. But the strong start turned into a breakdown weeks later, after he was diagnosed with injuries in his arm and shoulder which required season-ending surgery. At that time, Armas had a record of 2–1, 23 strikeouts and a 2.61 ERA, with a WHIP of 1.065 and not allowing a home run until his fifth and last start.

Armas worked out in 2004 spring training, and his recovery was proceeding. Although the team initially hoped he could be ready for the start of the season, the rehabilitation was slower than expected. He finished the season with a 2–4 mark in 72 innings.

In a nine-year career, Armas had a 52–65 record with 674 strikeouts and a 4.62 ERA in 917.3 innings. At bat, he was a .098 hitter (26-for-265) with ten RBI.

During the 2006 season, Armas had a 9–12 record in 30 starts. Armas missed one month with arm problems, but in his second game back from the disabled list he pitched seven innings, allowing only one run on three hits.

On October 29, 2006, Armas filed for free agency.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On February 1, 2007, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates for a one-year $3.5 million contract with a 2008 mutual option. After starting the 2007 season 0–3 with an 8.92 ERA, Armas was removed from the rotation.

===New York Mets===
On February 11, 2008, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the New York Mets. He re-signed with the Mets in January 2009. However, he was released on March 31, 2009, after not making the team.

===Atlanta Braves===
In April 2009, he was signed by the Atlanta Braves and assigned to the Triple-A Gwinnett Braves. On July 25, 2009, the Braves released Armas.

==Pitching style==
Armas used a low-90s moving fastball and a sharp-breaking curve to establish what he wanted to do with each hitter. He had an effective slider, a splitter, and a changeup to keep opponents out of balance.

==Personal life==
Armas is the son of former All-Star outfielder Tony Armas, and a nephew of former first baseman Marcos Armas. Tony&#x27;s father broke into the Majors with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1976.

<doc id="643218" wikidata="Q1121532" url="?curid=643218" title="Battle of Alcácer Quibir">
<text>The Battle of Alcácer Quibir (also known as &quot;Battle of Three Kings&quot; () or &quot;Battle of Wadi al-Makhazin&quot; () in Morocco) was fought in northern Morocco, near the town of Ksar-el-Kebir (variant spellings: &quot;Ksar El Kebir&quot;, &quot;Alcácer-Quivir&quot;, &quot;Alcazarquivir&quot;, &quot;Alcassar&quot;, etc.) and Larache, on 4 August 1578.

A Moroccan victory, the battle has been described as &quot;the greatest military disaster the Portuguese ever suffered in the course of their overseas expansion.&quot; It marked an end to Portuguese attempts to reconquer territories it had lost in Morocco.

The combatants were the army of the deposed Moroccan Sultan Abu Abdallah Mohammed II, with his ally, the King of Portugal Sebastian I, against a large Moroccan army under the new Sultan of Morocco (and uncle of Abu Abdallah Mohammed II) Abd Al-Malik I.

The Christian king Sebastian I had planned a crusade after Abu Abdallah asked him to help recover his throne. Abu Abdallah&#x27;s uncle, Abd Al-Malik, had taken it from him with Ottoman support. The defeat of Portugal and disappearance of the childless Sebastian led to the end of the Aviz dynasty, and the integration of the country in the Iberian Union for 60 years under the Philippine dynasty in a dynastic union with Spain.

== Prelude ==
=== King Sebastian of Portugal ===
Sebastian, who would later be known in Portugal as &quot;the Desired&quot;, was the son of the Infante Dom John (son of John III of Portugal) and Joanna, daughter of the Emperor Charles V. His father died before he was born, and he became king at the age of three after the death of his grandfather in 1557. He was educated almost entirely by Jesuits, by his guardian and tutor Aleixo de Meneses and by Catherine of Austria, sister of Charles V and wife of King John III. Some, judging him after his defeat, alleged that under these influences his youthful idealism soon mutated into religious fanaticism, although he never joined the Holy League.

The Portuguese Cortes asked Sebastian several times to go to Morocco and stop the turmoil of the advancing Turkish military presence, because the Ottomans would be a threat to the security of the Portuguese coasts and to the commerce with Guinea, Brazil, and the Atlantic Islands, like the Azores and Madeira. But it was only when Abu Abdallah Mohammed II al-Mutawakkil went to Portugal and asked for Sebastian&#x27;s help in recovering his throne from his uncle that Sebastian decided to mount a military effort. Sebastian felt driven to revive lost glories by intervening in North Africa, influenced by the events such as the defense of Mazagan in 1562 from a Moroccan siege. Accordingly, in 1568, the kingdom began to prepare for intervention in Morocco.

This policy was not only supported by the mercantile bourgeoisie as it would benefit commerce in this area (primarily, gold, cattle, wheat, and sugar), but also by the nobility. Up to that time Portuguese military action in Africa had been confined to small expeditions and raids; Portugal had built its vast maritime empire from Brazil to the East Indies by a combination of trade, sea exploration, and technological superiority, with Christian conversion of subject peoples being one, but by no means the only, end in view. Sebastian proposed to change this strategy entirely.

In 1574 Sebastian visited some of the Portuguese bases in North Africa and led a successful raid on Muslim territory beyond the then Portuguese city of Tangier, engaging in several skirmishes and in a confrontation of greater magnitude on 21 October. Although in numerical inferiority but with a heavy contingent of cavalry, he was successful, which encouraged him to grander designs against the new Saadian ruler of Morocco. He gave his support to Al-Mutawakkil, who was engaged in a civil war to recover the throne of Morocco from his uncle, the Emir Abd Al-Malik—who was aided by the Ottomans. Despite the admonitions of his mother and his uncle Philip II of Spain (who had become very cautious after the Battle of Djerba), Sebastian was determined to wage a military campaign, and he used much of Portugal&#x27;s imperial wealth to equip a large fleet and gather an army which included soldiers of several nationalities: 2,000 volunteers from Spain (Castile), 3,000 mercenaries from Flanders and Germany, and 600 Italians initially recruited to aid in an invasion of Ireland under the leadership of the English adventurer, Thomas Stukley. It is said that the expeditionary force numbered 500 ships, and the army in total numbered about 18,000 men, including the flower of the Portuguese nobility.

=== Sultan Abd al-Malik of Morocco ===
Morocco, meanwhile, was under the rule of the Saadi (or Saadian) dynasty, a Moroccan Sharifian dynasty. Their rise to power began as a resistance to the Portuguese presence in Agadir and by the 1550s they controlled most of present-day Morocco and had supplanted the earlier Wattasid dynasty. Upon the death of Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib in 1574 his son Muhammad II al-Mutawakkil inherited the throne, but two years later he was overthrown by his uncle Abd al-Malik. Abd al-Malik had travelled to Istanbul in 1574 and secured Ottoman support from the Sultan there himself. The beylerbey of Algiers provided him with troops and with these Abd al-Malik was able to depose his nephew after winning a decisive victory near Fez. Once on the throne, as an Ottoman vassal he had the Friday prayers and the &quot;khutba&quot; in mosques delivered in the Ottoman sultan&#x27;s name (Murad III), adopted Ottoman clothing, and organized his army along Ottoman lines with the help of Turkish officers. After this, the Saadi army, whose bulk was recruited from &quot;guich&quot; troops (&quot;military tribes&quot; mobilized to serve as regular levies), combined mounted arquebusiers, infantry armed with rifles, large numbers of light cavalry, and a detachment of artillery; most of which were newly trained in Ottoman tactics. In addition to his local &quot;guich&quot; troops and Berber contingents, many of the soldiers were recruited from Andalusis previously expelled from the Iberian Peninsula (or descended from those refugees), Berber tribes from the east such as the Zwawa, and from the Turks and ex-Ottoman soldiers in the region.

=== Ottoman presence ===

Indications of the presence of an Ottoman force accompanying the Moroccans to the battlefield vary between sources. Historian Stephen Cory, in reviewing relations between the Saadians and Ottomans in this period, states that the battle was won by the Saadians &quot;without direct Ottoman assistance.&quot; Abderrahmane El Moudden, in a large study of Ottoman-Saadian diplomacy in this period, notes that some modern Turkish sources attribute the 1578 victory to Ottoman forces led by Ramazan Pasha on the field—though he also notes that some of these sources are liable to exaggerate Turkish military history.

In an encyclopedic entry about King Sebastian, historian Allen Fromherz indicates the presence of Ottoman forces at the battle, including Janissaries. Historian R. G. Grant states that Abd al-Malik&#x27;s army was &quot;partly supplied by the Ottoman Turks&quot; and that it combined &quot;Moroccan cavalry with Ottoman musket-armed infantry and cannon&quot;. Professor of Islamic Studies, Jamil M. Abun-Nasr, states that the Turks &quot;could not take over the affairs of Morocco after [the Battle of Alcácer&#x27;s] victory to which they contributed much&quot;. He also mentions that Abd al-Malik&#x27;s army included Turkish troops, that its officers were Turks and so was the commander of his army, who is alleged to have had Abd al-Malik poisoned in order to secure total Ottoman control over Morocco.

== Campaign ==
After haranguing his troops from the windows of the Church of Santa Maria in Lagos, Sebastian departed that port in his armada on 24 June 1578.

He landed at Arzila, in Portuguese Morocco, where Abu Abdallah joined him with an additional 6,000 Moorish allied troops, and marched into the interior.

Abd al-Malik I, who was gravely ill, had meanwhile collected a large army, rallying his countrymen to jihad against the Portuguese invaders. The two armies approached each other near Ksar-el-Kebir, camping on opposite sides of the Loukkos River.

=== Battle ===

On 4 August 1578, the Portuguese and Moorish allied troops were drawn up in battle array, and Sebastian rode around encouraging the ranks. But the Moroccans advanced on a broad front, planning to encircle his army.

The Sultan had 10,000 cavalry on the wings, and in the center had placed Moors who had been driven out of Spain and thus bore a special grudge against Christians. Despite his illness, the Sultan left his litter and led his forces on horseback.

The battle started as both sides exchanged several volleys of gunfire from musketry and artillery. Stukley, commanding the Portuguese center, was killed by a cannonball early in the battle. The Moroccan cavalry advanced and began to encircle the Portuguese army. Both armies soon became fully engaged in a melee.

The flanks of the Portuguese army began to give way to the Moorish cavalry, and eventually the center became threatened as well. Seeing the flanks compromised, and having lost its commander early in battle, the Portuguese center lost heart and was overcome.

The battle ended after nearly four hours of heavy fighting and resulted in the total defeat of the Portuguese and Abu Abdallah&#x27;s army with 8,000 dead, including the slaughter of almost the whole of Portugal&#x27;s nobility. 15,000 were captured and sold into slavery, and around 100 survivors escaped to the coast. The body of King Sebastian, who led a charge into the midst of the enemy and was then cut off, was never found.

The Sultan Abd Al-Malik died during the battle from natural causes (the effort of riding was too much for him), but the news was concealed from his troops until total victory had been secured. Abu Abdallah attempted to flee but drowned in the river. Because of the deaths during the fighting of Sebastian, Abu Abdallah, and Abd Al-Malik, the battle became known in Morocco as the Battle of the Three Kings.

== Legacy ==
Abd Al-Malik was succeeded as Sultan by his brother Ahmad al-Mansur, also known as Ahmed Addahbi, who conquered Timbuktu, Gao, and Jenne after defeating the Songhai Empire. The Moroccan army which invaded Songhai in 1590–91 was made up mostly of European captives, including a number of Portuguese taken prisoner at the battle of Alcácer Quibir.

For Portugal, the battle was an unmitigated disaster. Sebastian died on the battlefield along with most of the Portuguese nobility. The captive nobles were ransomed, nearly bankrupting Portugal. Despite the lack of a body, Sebastian was presumed dead, at the age of 24. In his piety, he had remained unmarried and had sired no heir. His aged, childless uncle Henry of Portugal, a cardinal of the Roman church, succeeded to the throne as closest legitimate relative. His brief reign (1578–1580) was devoted to attempting to raise the crippling financial reparations demanded by the disastrous Morocco venture. After his death, legitimate claimants to the throne of the House of Aviz, which had ruled Portugal for 200 years, were defeated by a Castilian military invasion. Philip II of Spain, a maternal grandson of Manuel I of Portugal, and nearest male claimant (being an uncle of Sebastian I), invaded with an army of 40,000 men, defeating the troops of Anthony, Prior of Crato at the Battle of Alcântara and was crowned Philip I of Portugal by the Cortes of Tomar in 1581.

Later, at the beginning of his reign, Philip II ordered that the mutilated remains said to be Sebastian&#x27;s (and so recognized after the battle by some of his close companions), and still in North Africa, be returned to Portugal, where they were buried at the Jerónimos Monastery, in Lisbon. Portugal and its Empire were not &quot;de jure&quot; incorporated into the Spanish Empire, and remained as a separate realm of the Spanish Habsburgs until 1640 when it broke away through the Portuguese Restoration War.

Partly in reaction to the national trauma of this disastrous defeat, a cult of &#x27;Sebastianism&#x27; which portrayed the lost monarch in terms similar to King Arthur arose. The legend of Portugal&#x27;s &quot;Once and Future King&quot; who would some day return to save his nation has ebbed and flowed in Portuguese life ever since.

<doc id="643219" wikidata="Q1950377" url="?curid=643219" title="1967–1970">
<text>1967–1970, also known as the Blue Album, is a compilation album of songs by the English rock band the Beatles, spanning the years indicated in the title. A double LP, it was released with &quot;1962–1966&quot; (the &quot;Red Album&quot;) in April 1973. &quot;1967–1970&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart in the United States and peaked at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart. It was re-released in September 1993 on CD, charting at number 4 in the United Kingdom.

The album was instigated by Apple Records manager Allen Klein during his final months before being dismissed from that position. As with &quot;1962–1966&quot;, the compilation was created by Apple and EMI/Capitol Records in response to a bootleg collection titled &quot;Alpha Omega&quot;, which had been sold on television the previous year. Print advertising for the two records made a point of declaring them &quot;the only collection of the Beatles&quot;. The success of the two official double LP compilations inspired Capitol&#x27;s repackaging of the Beach Boys&#x27; 1960s hits, starting with the 1974 album &quot;Endless Summer&quot;.

A deluxe expanded version of the album was released on 10 November 2023, featuring the previously unreleased song &quot;Now and Then&quot;, the final original single by the group. The deluxe edition features the album anniversary remix versions of the songs.

== Album covers ==
For the group&#x27;s 1963 debut LP &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, photographer Angus McBean took the distinctive colour photograph of the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI House (EMI&#x27;s London headquarters in Manchester Square, demolished in 1995). The cover for the 1963 EP &quot;The Beatles (No. 1)&quot; used a picture from the same shoot.

In 1969, the Beatles asked McBean to recreate this shot. Although a photograph from the 1969 photo shoot was originally intended for the then-planned &quot;Get Back&quot; album, it was not used when that project saw eventual release in 1970 as &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Instead, another photograph from the 1969 shoot, along with an unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot, was used for both this LP and &quot;1962–1966&quot;.

The inner gatefold photo for both LPs has been attributed to both Stephen Goldblatt and Don McCullin, and is from the &quot;Mad Day Out&quot; photo session in London on Sunday 28 July 1968.

The album cover was designed by Tom Wilkes.

==International versions==
Unlike the &quot;1962–1966&quot; collection, the Blue Album was largely the same in the U.S. and the UK, although there were some variations.

The U.S. edition had &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; in its original 1966 stereo mix, while &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; were presented in mono, and &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; with a four-beat electric piano introduction; the UK version had the more common six-beat beginning.

The albums had several other variants and anomalies. &quot;Get Back&quot; was described as the album version in the U.S. liner notes, although it was in fact the single version. In both countries, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was around nine seconds shorter than it had been on the original single, although the full length was restored for the 1993 compact disc edition.

The original vinyl version faded in during the crowd noise at the beginning of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. The fade in was different on both the UK and U.S. versions. The original compact disc edition, meanwhile, featured a clean version previously heard on the &quot;&quot; soundtrack album in 1988.

On the Spanish edition, &quot;One After 909&quot; replaced &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;, a song that had been banned from the airwaves shortly after being released as a single in 1969, for its allusions to &quot;Christ&quot; and &quot;Gibraltar&quot; in the lyrics.

=== 2023 remixed editions ===
The compilation, along with its counterpart, was rereleased with an expanded track listing on 10 November 2023.

The nine additional tracks are: &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;Glass Onion&quot;, &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot;, &quot;Oh! Darling&quot;, &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot;, &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, and &quot;Now and Then&quot;.

Six tracks (&quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot;, and &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot;) received new stereo mixes for this release. The stereo mixes for the remaining tracks were sourced from those created for the following previously released album reissues: &quot;1&quot; (2015), &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band: 50th Anniversary Edition&quot; (2017), &quot;The Beatles: 50th Anniversary Edition&quot; (2018), &quot;Abbey Road: 50th Anniversary Edition&quot; (2019), and &quot;Let It Be: Special Edition&quot; (2021). The album is also available in Dolby Atmos surround sound. On the CD and digital editions, the additional tracks are inserted into the track list in chronological order of each track&#x27;s original issue, while on the vinyl edition, the first two LPs retain the track list of the 1973 release, with the additional tracks placed on a third LP. The vinyl edition come in both standard and coloured vinyl with each compilation&#x27;s respective colours.

Of note, both &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; and &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; feature clean openings on the 2023 release, as opposed to their album counterparts, which are crossfaded with their respective preceding tracks. The dialogue introduction previously added to the 2021 Mix of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; for &quot;Let It Be: Special Edition&quot; has also been removed.

== Track listing ==
* The singles &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;, the B-sides &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot;, and the single versions of &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot; make their global album debut in this compilation.


All tracks are written by Lennon-McCartney, except where noted.

<text>In Japanese popular culture, a , also romanized as bishojo or bishoujo, is a cute girl character. characters appear ubiquitously in media including manga, anime, and computerized games (especially in the &quot;bishojo&quot; game genre), and also appear in advertising and as mascots, such as for maid cafés. An attraction towards characters is a key concept in &quot;otaku&quot; (manga and anime fan) subculture. 

The development of the aesthetic in manga of the early 1980s marked a departure from previous realistic styles, and the emergence of the aesthetic of &quot;cute eroticism&quot; (&quot;kawaii ero&quot;) and &quot;moe&quot;.

==History==

The character type emerged in the &quot;lolicon&quot; boom of the early 1980s, particularly in the works of manga artist Hideo Azuma. Azuma&#x27;s characters combined the round bodies of Osamu Tezuka characters and the round and emotive faces of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga. At the time, the dominant style in seinen and pornographic manga was &quot;gekiga&quot;, a realistic style characterized by sharp angles, dark hatching, and gritty lines; in contrast, Azuma&#x27;s work displayed light shading and clean, circular lines. In doing so, Azuma developed &quot;cute eroticism&quot; (&quot;kawaii ero&quot;), a form of eroticism based on manga-style characters. &quot;Lolicon&quot; (derived from &quot;Lolita complex&quot;) was one of several terms referring to this expansion in cute characters in manga and anime, and a corresponding attraction to and affection for such characters. Synonyms include &quot;two-dimensional complex&quot; (&quot;nijigen konpurekkusu&quot;), &quot;two-dimensional fetishism&quot; (&quot;nijikon fechi&quot;), &quot;two-dimensional syndrome&quot; (&quot;nijikon shōkōgun&quot;), &quot;cute girl syndrome&quot; (&quot;bishōjo shōkōgun&quot;), and simply &quot;sickness&quot; (&quot;byōki&quot;).

Several characters created by Hayao Miyazaki are considered icons of the boom, particularly Clarisse from the film &quot;Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro&quot; (1979), Lana from the TV series &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; (1978), and Nausicaä from his manga and film &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1984). Another creator strongly associated with the boom was Rumiko Takahashi, whose character Lum from her manga &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; (1978–1987) gained immense popularity. Cultural critic Hiroki Azuma identifies Lum as a key development in fan interaction and response to characters:

==Features==
 characters are typified by design elements (such as personality archetypes, clothing, and accessories) that are known and acknowledged by the audience. 

==Media==

 characters appear in almost all genres of anime and manga and in many video games, especially in dating sims and visual novels, sometimes to get more players or simply just to make a game look good. characters tend to attract males. characters sometimes are the most popular female characters as most people like anime, manga, dating sims, and visual novels more when the art stands out, looks pretty, and has beautiful females.

===&quot;Bishōjo&quot; games===
Games that are made with the intent of featuring &quot;bishōjo&quot; characters are known as &quot;bishōjo&quot; games. Because visual novels are considered games as well, &quot;bishōjo&quot; games also encapsulate visual novels made with the intent of featuring &quot;bishōjo&quot; characters. Although &quot;bishōjo&quot; games are made with a male audience in mind, they can extend to a female audience as well, such as the &quot;Touhou Project&quot;.

===Confusion regarding terminology===
Although is not a genre but a character design, series which predominantly feature such characters, such as harem anime and visual novels, are sometimes informally called series. The characters and works referred to by the term are typically intended to appeal to a male audience. Since one of the main draws of these series is typically the art and the attractive female characters, the term is occasionally perceived negatively, as a genre which is solely dependent on the marketability of beautiful characters rather than the actual content or plot.

The word is sometimes confused with the similar-sounding &quot;shōjo&quot; (&quot;girl&quot;) demographic, but refers to the gender and traits of the &quot;characters&quot; it describes, whereas &quot;shōjo&quot; refers to the gender and age of an &quot;audience&quot; demographic – manga publications, and sometimes anime, described as &quot;shōjo&quot; are aimed at young female audiences.

 is not to be confused with bishōnen – beautiful boy. It is also not to be confused with moe – which is a definition for a genre of entertainment which features cute/adorable girls rather than &quot;sexy&quot; girls. Although elements of Moe and are often blended together, so the two elements are closely entwined and cannot be completely separated from one another.

<doc id="643221" wikidata="Q4308215" url="?curid=643221" title="John Moores (British businessman)">
<text>Sir John Moores (25 January 1896 – 25 September 1993) was an English businessman, telegraphist, football club owner, politician and philanthropist, most famous for the founding of the now defunct Littlewoods retail and football pools company. Liverpool John Moores University is named in his honour.

Moores&#x27; football-betting empire and Littlewoods stores made him one of Britain&#x27;s richest men.

==Early years==
John Moores was born at the Church Inn, Eccles, Lancashire, on Saturday, 25 January, 1896. He was the second of eight children and the eldest of four sons born to bricklayer John William Moores (17 September 1871 – 9 February 1919) and Louisa Moores (née Fethney) (9 March 1873 – 13 December 1959). John came from a line of bricklayers, his great-grandfather Sidney Moores was one (1818–1884), as was his grandfather John Moores (1847–1910), though he eventually set up a small building contractors business, and was landlord of the Church Inn where the future owner of Littlewoods was born.

John William Moores later became a site foreman. He was a hard worker but developed a drink problem. In 1918 he developed tuberculosis and died of the illness in 1919 aged 47.

At the age of 12, John got his first job, helping with a milk round before school started. He left elementary school in 1909, at the age of 13. John became a messenger boy at the Manchester Post Office, but was sacked for talking back to his superior. Shortly afterwards however, he was soon accepted in a course at the Post Office School of Telegraphy. This enabled him, in 1912 to join the Commercial Cable Company as a junior operator. Moores was in a reserved occupation and did not have to be called up for military service but he volunteered for the Navy in 1917, as a wireless operator. He was posted to a shore station in Aberdeen where he remained until April 1919.

==Pre-Littlewoods days==
After being demobilised from the Navy, Moores carried on working for the Commercial Cable company. In the early Summer of 1920 he was posted to their training school in Bixteth Street, Liverpool but after being taught to touch type, seventy to eighty words per minute and how to read cable slip, in November 1920, Moores was posted to Waterville in County Kerry, Ireland. He complained about the food that was served at the Waterville Cable Company Station, whose function was to receive messages from the US and Canada and re-transmit them to London and Liverpool. Moores was elected to run the Mess Committee. He established the Waterville Supply Company to order food from a variety of suppliers instead of just one, so was able to reduce costs and raise the quality of meals. Moores noticed that there was no public library around for miles. As a result, in April 1921 he set up a store that sold books and stationery. He bulk imported books from Britain and from Dublin and also sold golf balls as there was no sports shop or golf course. Between his telegraphist salary and the profits he made from the Waterville Supply Company (helped by his status of Mess President which meant that he did not have to pay for his own meals) he made £1,000 in 18 months.

In May 1922, Moores was posted back to Liverpool.

==Start of the football pools==

John, Colin Askham and Bill Hughes were friends who had worked together as Post Office messenger boys in Manchester. It was whilst looking for a new money-making idea that Moores heard about John Jervis Barnard, a Birmingham man who had latched onto the public&#x27;s growing passion for two things: football and betting.

Barnard had devised a &#x27;football pool&#x27;, where punters would bet on the outcome of football matches. The payouts to winners came from the &#x27;pool&#x27; of money that was bet, less 10 per cent to cover &quot;management costs&quot;. It had not been particularly successful. Clearly, Barnard was struggling to make a profit. Hughes obtained one of Barnard&#x27;s pools coupon, and the three friends one night, in September 1922, when the cable machines were quiet, sat discussing what Barnard would have to do to make money on it. Then they decided they could do it better and they could make money out of it themselves.

They could not let their employers, the Commercial Cable Company, know what they were doing, or they would be sacked. No outside employment was allowed. That ruled out calling it, for example, John Moores Football Pool or the Colin Askham football pool. The solution to that particular problem came from Colin. He had been orphaned as a baby and been brought up by an aunt whose surname was Askham, but he had been born Colin Henry Littlewood. And so, on 1 February 1923, the Littlewood Football Pool – as it was called originally – was started.

Each of the three partners invested £50 of their own money into the venture, and with the help of a small, discreet and cheap printer they got to work. In 1923, £50 was a huge sum to invest in what – based on Barnard&#x27;s experience – was a precarious venture, and as Moores himself remembered: &quot;As I signed my own cheque at the bank, my hands were damp. It seemed such a lot of money to be risking&quot;.

A small office in Church Street, Liverpool, was rented and the first 4,000 coupons were distributed outside Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford ground before one Saturday match that winter. Moores handed the coupons out himself, helped by some young boys eager to earn a few pennies.

It was not an instant success as just 35 coupons were returned. With bets totalling £4 7s 6d (£4.37½), the 10 per cent deducted did not cover the three men&#x27;s expenses. They decided to print 10,000 coupons, and took them to Hull, where they were handed out before a big game. This time, only one coupon was returned. Their venture was about to collapse almost as soon as it had begun. In the canteen of the Commercial Cable Company, the three partners held a crisis meeting. They had kept pumping money into the fledgling business, but midway through the 1924–25 football season it was still losing money. The three young men had already invested £200, with no prospect of things improving. Bill Hughes suggested they cut their losses and forget the whole thing. Colin Askham agreed. They could see why John Jervis Barnard&#x27;s idea of a football pool had failed in Birmingham. They expected Moores to concur, but instead he said: &quot;I&#x27;ll pay each of you the £200 you&#x27;ve invested, if you&#x27;ll sell me your shares&quot;.

Moores admitted that he considered giving up on the business himself, but was encouraged by his wife, who told him &quot;I would rather be married to a man who is haunted by failure rather than one haunted by regret&quot;. Moores kept faith and he paid Askham and Hughes £200 each.

The following year Moores enlisted the help of his younger brother Cecil to help, along with the rest of his family. In 1927 Moores gave up working for the Cable Company but in April 1929, he was prosecuted under the Ready Money Betting Act 1920. Following a court appearance, he was convicted. However, as his company never accepted cash, only postal orders that were cashed after the football results and the winning payout had been confirmed, his appeal was upheld.

In 1928, Cecil Moores devised a security system to prevent cheating. The breakthrough came when the owner of the coupon printing company Arthur Bottomes suggested that he took his exact expenses out (plus a bit extra) before calculating the winning payout. Eventually the pools took off, becoming one of the best-known names in Britain.

Moores insisted on being known as &quot;Mr John&quot; to those who worked at Littlewoods, rather than Mr Moores or Boss.

==Littlewoods Mail Order==
In January 1932, Moores, who was by now a millionaire, was able to disengage himself sufficiently from the pools to start up Littlewoods Mail Order Store. At the end of the first year the turnover was £100,000. A year later, in 1934, it had risen to £400,000; and by early 1936 mail order was grossing £4 million a year. Moores had made his second million. The idea may have come from the little mail-order firm Moores had started in 1921 in Ireland, and he knew that the enormous mailing list which pools had built up would be very helpful; but it was also inspired by the hardship and poverty prevalent everywhere in the bleak depression years at the beginning of the 1930s. Also, he could remember only too well the difficulties with which his mother had to cope when feeding, clothing, and bringing up a large family or the problems when his father was too ill to work or following his death as his mother had three children then aged 13, 11 and 9 to bring up. There had for some time been institutions in existence, such as the Co-operative Society, and the tallyman of the north, which enabled the poorer members of society to buy things they needed. Moores&#x27;s originality lay in applying a mix of these schemes to a large-scale business enterprise.

As usual all the family were involved. They researched and planned catalogues and helped to choose the merchandise, and Moores visited the United States to get information from big American mail-order firms such as Sears Roebuck and also Europe.

==Littlewoods stores==
This was followed on 6 July 1937 by the opening of the first &quot;Littlewoods&quot; department store in Blackpool. By the time World War II started there were 25 Littlewoods stores across the UK and over 50 by 1952.

==The war years==
The company then turned to war work – warehouses were equipped and staff were retrained so that the company could make parachutes. From 1940 they also made barrage balloons and in 1941 dinghies and munitions were added to the manufacturing portfolio. 1942 saw aircraft parts and bridge pieces being manufactured and from 1943 the firm built storm-boats that could cross water and land on beaches. They also became experts at &#x27;boxing&#x27; – making compact transportable kits containing dismantled vehicles that could be reassembled at their destination overseas. The boxing division also made Pacific Packs containing rations for soldiers in the Far East. The football pools continued during the war years however.

==Post-war==
In late January 1947, Moores fell ill and contracted meningitis – he spent two weeks in hospital. He recovered and returned to work in March but later said he felt run down for a while after that. The businesses continued to expand, and his two sons were given roles in the chain stores and at director level. The company branched out into manufacturing and testing of garments as a natural progression from the manufacturing work that had been carried out during World War II.

He decided to delegate more and put his financial affairs in order. He took out a five-year £1 million life insurance policy and put some of his shares in trust for his children (with various conditions – they were not allowed to sell the shares, his daughters received half as many as his sons in case they married as he did not want any men who were not family having influence over his business, and no child would have any shareholder power until they were 30 years old).

In 1957 the company installed its first computer to help with stock control. Nine years later in 1966 an IBM System/360 computer was installed. In June 1961 Littlewoods took over Sherman&#x27;s Pools of Cardiff and Moores launched a sixth mail-order company, Peter Craig in 1967 in Preston.

==Everton Football Club==
In March 1960, Moores gave up his chairmanship of the pools business, and handed over the reins to his brother, Cecil Moores, (10 August 1902 – 29 July 1989), so he could become a director of Everton Football Club. In June, he became the chairman. On 23 June it was revealed that during the 1959–1960 season he had lent Everton £56,000 interest free so they could buy players and on 14 April 1961 he famously sacked Johnny Carey in the back of a London taxi and appointed Harry Catterick as Everton manager in his place. The event would become synonymous in football with the phrase &quot;taxi for...&quot;, particularly for under fire football managers.

He would remain as Everton chairman up to 29 July 1965, resigning due to the poor health of his wife, who died of cancer six weeks later. On 3 August 1972, Moores regained the chairmanship and was chairman until 1 August 1973 when he resigned for the second and final time. He then became vice-chairman. Moores retired from the Everton board of directors on 8 July 1977.

Moores attended the 1984, 1985 and 1986 FA Cup finals, all of which featured Everton. At the 1987 Football League Cup Final, sponsored by Littlewoods, Moores was the guest of honour and presented the League Cup to the winning team who were Arsenal.

==Baseball==
John Moores was a keen baseball fan and created a league for Liverpool-based teams in 1933. He later enticed Everton players such as Dixie Dean to the game. In 1938, he donated the John Moores Trophy to the English national team for beating the United States four games to one in a five-game series, in what became known as the first Amateur World Series. The Great Britain team consisted largely of Canadians from the Yorkshire-Lancashire league.

In October 2009, Moores was posthumously inducted into the British Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Knighthood==
On 30 April 1970, along with his friend Bessie Braddock, Moores was made a Freeman of the City of Liverpool. In 1972, he was made a CBE, going to Buckingham Palace to receive it on 14 November that year for his youth work and services to the arts on Merseyside. In 1978 he was awarded the first Gold Medal for achievement, and in June 1980 he was knighted. He received his knighthood from Prince Charles on 29 October 1980.

==Family==
Moores married Ruby Knowles (27 October 1894 – 8 September 1965) in Liverpool on 19 September 1923. They had four children:
# Elizabeth, Lady Grantchester (8 June 1925 – 2 February 2019) who married on 12 April 1947 Kenneth Bent Suenson-Taylor, 2nd Baron Grantchester (18 August 1921 – 12 August 1995), and had issue including the present Lord Grantchester. 

# John Moores Jr., CBE (22 November 1928 – 22 May 2012),
# Peter Moores, CBE (9 April 1932 – 23 March 2016) and
# Janitha Moores later Stubbs (b. 4 July 1937).

==Other interests==
In 1992, &quot;Liverpool Polytechnic&quot; took the name Liverpool John Moores University in his honour upon being granted university status. A statue was later built which stands in the courtyard of the university&#x27;s Avril Robarts Library.

In 1956 he became chairman of the Liverpool Motorists&#x27; Outing for Handicapped Children.

The John Moores Painting Prize is co-ordinated by National Museums Liverpool. The first John Moores exhibition was held in 1957, six years after the Walker Art Gallery re-opened after World War II. It was intended as a one-off, but its success led to it becoming a biennial event. By the early 1960s, the exhibition was regarded as the UK&#x27;s leading showcase for avant-garde painting. Winning works have included classic paintings by Jack Smith (&quot;Creation and Crucifixion&quot;), William Scott, Roger Hilton (&quot;March 1963&quot;) and David Hockney (&quot;Peter Getting Out of Nick&#x27;s Pool&quot;).

==Political activities==
Between 1933 and August 1940 Moores was a Conservative councillor for the Sefton parish for Sefton Rural District and West Lancashire Rural District. In September 1933 he stood as a National Government candidate for Clay Cross and at the November 1935 General Election in Nuneaton but failed to be elected both times. Moores was critical of socialism, but in November 1935 he called for coal miners to be paid more money and for them to have better working conditions. Despite his Conservative views, he was a friend of the Labour MP Bessie Braddock and the two worked together on several projects involving Liverpool.

==Later years==

Moores retired as chairman on 24 October 1977 of Littlewoods and was succeeded by his son Peter. He went into semi-retirement, visiting his office on the 11th floor of the Littlewoods organisation between 10 am and 1 pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. However, as profits fell from 49 million to 11 million, (Moores remained on the board) he resumed the chairmanship on 10 October 1980. He resigned for the second and final time on 25 March 1982 and went into semi-retirement again. On 28 May 1982 he was made life president of the organisation. He attended board meetings until 1986. 

On 23 March 1986, Moores was burgled and tied up in his home. Two shotguns, jewellery, and money were stolen. The case was featured on &quot;Crimewatch UK&quot; two months later.

John Clement succeeded Moores as chairman, the first non-family member to do so. Moores had two operations, on his achilles tendon in May 1986, and then for an enlarged prostate in July 1986, but never fully recovered nor regained his health. In 1987 he used a walking stick as a mobility aid but by the following year he was confined to a wheelchair.

In May 1988, he attended his final ever AGM, but whilst there he began to struggle to speak and suddenly lost his thread. That was his final ever involvement with Littlewoods. He was unable to talk at all in the final years of his life.

==Death==
Sir John Moores died at his home, &quot;Fairways&quot;, at Shireburn Road, Freshfield, Formby, on Saturday, 25 September 1993, where he had lived since 1930. He was cremated six days later in Southport in a funeral attended by family members only. A memorial service was held for him on 30 November 1993 in Liverpool&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral attended by 2,000 people, 1,500 of them Littlewoods employees. His son John Jnr paid tribute to his late father in an address.

==Will==
The following month it was revealed he left an estate valued at £10 million gross in his will that he made on 11 March 1988. and that he left most of his fortune to his four children. Littlewoods revealed he relinquished nearly all his shares in Littlewoods in 1979. His shares in Everton FC were left to his two sons and his shareholdings and investments in Bermuda to his two daughters.

The &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; 1989 estimated his estate to be worth £1.7 billion. The Littlewoods businesses were sold to the Barclay Brothers, nine years after Moores&#x27; death, in October 2002.

In the 2006 &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot;, the Moores family&#x27;s wealth was estimated at £1,160M.

<text>Sabrina D. Harman (born January 5, 1978) is an American former soldier who was court-martialed by the United States Army for prisoner abuse after the 2003–2004 Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal. Along with other soldiers of her Army Reserve unit, the 372nd Military Police Company, she was accused of allowing and inflicting physical and psychological abuse on Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib prison, a notorious prison in Baghdad during the United States&#x27; occupation of Iraq.

Harman was convicted of maltreatment of detainees, conspiracy to maltreat detainees, and dereliction of duty. She was sentenced to six months in prison, forfeiture of all her pay and benefits, demoted, and given a bad conduct discharge. She was imprisoned in the Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar in San Diego, California.

Harman consistently acknowledged a fear that the abuses being committed at Abu Ghraib, both during her time at the facility, and afterwards during her sentencing, would be a cause for the rise of further radicalization in the region, as would later be seen in the formation of groups such as ISIL.

==Early life and education==
Harman was born in Lorton, Virginia. Her father was a homicide detective. Harman graduated from Robert E. Lee High School in Springfield, Virginia.

==Military career==

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Harman joined the Army Reserve and was assigned to the Cresaptown, Maryland-based 372nd Military Police company. Harman worked for a time as an assistant manager at Papa John&#x27;s Pizza in Alexandria, Virginia, before her company was activated for duty in Iraq in February 2003, and was deployed to Fort Lee, Virginia for additional training; however, this was in combat support, not internment and resettlement.

Harman, an MP, was stationed at Abu Ghraib as a guard.

=== Abu Ghraib facility ===
Harman was the second soldier to be tried for mistreating prisoners at Abu Ghraib. She was depicted in several of the most notorious photos taken at Abu Ghraib in late October and early November 2003, and she is accused of taking other pictures.

In late October 2003, Harman wrote to Kelly Bryant, her roommate in Virginia whom she called her &quot;wife&quot; (as quoted by &quot;The New Yorker&quot;:)

Harman explained that her Military Police unit deferred to practices already being conducted by military officers and civilian contractors present at the facility:

[She] said she was assigned to break down prisoners for interrogation. &quot;They would bring in one to several prisoners at a time already hooded and cuffed,&quot; Harman said in interviews by e-mail this week from Baghdad. &quot;The job of the MP was to keep them awake, make it hell so they would talk.&quot; She said her military police unit took direction from the military intelligence officers in charge of the facility and from civilian contractors there who conducted interrogations.

== Sentencing ==
In 2005, Harman was convicted on six of the seven counts she had been initially charged with, which related to the maltreatment of detainees, conspiracy relating to abuse, and dereliction of duty; She was sentenced to six months in prison the following day, for which she would serve approximately four months due to credit for time already served.

Despite the gravity of the accusations involved, Harman received a fairly light sentence, serving just four months in prison. Throughout the case, various individuals, including two former prisoners at Abu Ghraib, proclaimed her innocent nature submitting testimonies in her defense, which were officially accepted by the court. These prisoners noted Harman’s &#x27;gentle&#x27; treatment of detainees, something unusual compared to other guards at the facility, who generally saw the prisoners as more or less as a proxy for military intelligence – “She has no cruelty in her, even though she is an American woman, she was just like a sister.” Her defense attorney, Frank Spinner, said: “I felt very strongly in Sabrina Harman, I feel she’s a very naive, very innocent person. … She didn’t know how to react to that experience (at Abu Ghraib).”

At her sentencing, Harman stated:As a soldier and military police officer, I failed my duties and failed my mission to protect and defend. I not only let down the people in Iraq, but I let down every single soldier that serves today. My actions potentially caused an increased hatred and insurgency towards the United States, putting soldiers and civilians at greater risk. I take full responsibility for my actions. ... The decisions I made were mine and mine alone.
Harman&#x27;s attorney said he hoped to see the military chain of command put on trial, rather than low-ranking reservists like Harman: 

On February 4, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces unanimously upheld Harman&#x27;s convictions.

<doc id="643225" wikidata="Q3569283" url="?curid=643225" title="Windmill Hill culture">
<text>The Windmill Hill culture was a name given to a people inhabiting southern Britain, in particular in the Salisbury Plain area close to Stonehenge, c. 3000 BC. They were an agrarian Neolithic people; their name comes from Windmill Hill, a causewayed enclosure near Avebury. Together with another Neolithic tribe from East Anglia, a tribe whose worship involved stone circles, it is thought that they were responsible for the earliest work on the Stonehenge site.

The material record left by these people includes large circular hill-top enclosures, causewayed enclosures, long barrows, leaf-shaped arrowheads, and polished stone axes. They raised cattle, sheep, pigs, and dogs, and grew wheat and mined flints.

Since the term was first coined by archaeologists, further excavation and analysis has indicated that it consisted of several discrete cultures such as the Hembury and Abingdon cultures; and that &quot;Windmill Hill culture&quot; is too general a term.

===Notes===
#The Atlanta Braves sale in 2007 to Liberty Media was part of a complex swap of cash, stock, magazine holdings, and the Braves, in which Time Warner sent the Braves, a hobbyist publishing company, and $980,000,000 to Liberty in exchange for approximately 68.5 million shares of Time Warner stock, at the time worth $1.48 billion. It was announced and confirmed that the Braves were given a value of $450,000,000 in the transaction.
#The price for the St. Louis Cardinals included Busch Stadium.
#As much as $200,000,000 of the sale price included the team&#x27;s 20-percent stake in Fox Sports San Diego.

<doc id="643230" wikidata="Q1029222" url="?curid=643230" title="Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems">
<text>Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, Inc. (MITS), was an American electronics company founded in Albuquerque, New Mexico that began manufacturing electronic calculators in 1971 and personal computers in 1975.

Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims founded MITS in December 1969 to produce miniaturized telemetry modules for model rockets such as a roll rate sensor. In 1971, Roberts redirected the company into the electronic calculator market and the MITS 816 desktop calculator kit was featured on the November 1971 cover of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. The calculators were very successful and sales topped one million dollars in 1973. A brutal calculator price war left the company deeply in debt by 1974.

Roberts then developed the first commercially successful microcomputer, the Altair 8800, which was featured on the January 1975 cover of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. Hobbyists flooded MITS with orders for the $397 computer kit. Paul Allen and Bill Gates saw the magazine and began writing software for the Altair, later called Altair BASIC. They moved to Albuquerque to work for MITS and in July 1975 started Microsoft.

MITS&#x27;s annual sales had reached $6 million by 1977 when they were acquired by Pertec Computer. The operations were soon merged into the larger company and the MITS brand disappeared. Roberts retired to Georgia where he studied medicine and became a small town medical doctor.

== Origin ==

=== Founders ===
Henry Edward Roberts studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Miami before enlisting in the U.S. Air Force in 1962. He soon became an electronics instructor at the Cryptographic Equipment Maintenance School at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. To augment his meager enlisted man&#x27;s pay, Roberts worked on several off-duty projects and even set up a one-man company, Reliance Engineering. The most notable job was to create the electronics that animated the Christmas characters in the window display of Joske&#x27;s department store in San Antonio. In 1965, he was selected for an Air Force program to complete his college degree, and became a commissioned officer. Roberts earned an Electrical Engineering degree from Oklahoma State University in 1968 and was assigned to the Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Forrest Mims was interested in science and electronics as a youth and even built an analog computer while in high school. Mims graduated from Texas A&amp;M University in 1966 (major in government with minors in English and history) then became a commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force. While serving in Vietnam as an intelligence officer, Mims continued his model rocket hobby. At Texas A&amp;M, Mims developed an infrared obstacle-sensing device and he experimented with it at the Saigon School for Blind Boys and Girls. Launching model rockets in an area accustomed to rocket attacks and working with blind children resulted in a story in the military newspaper, &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. This caught the attention of an Air Force Colonel, who arranged for Mims to be assigned to the Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB even though Mims lacked an engineering degree.

Roberts and Mims were both assigned to the Lab&#x27;s Laser Group in 1968. Roberts had reactivated Reliance Engineering and built an infrared intrusion alarm for his uncle&#x27;s fish farm in Florida. Later, Roberts and Stan Cagle, a civilian worker who also went to Oklahoma State, started building a power supply they hoped to sell. Mims became an advisor to the Albuquerque Model Rocket Club and met the publisher of &quot;Model Rocketry&quot; magazine in July 1969. Mims told him about a transistorized tracking light that he had used on night launches of rockets in Vietnam. This led to an article in the September 1969 issue of &quot;Model Rocketry&quot;; &quot;Transistorized Tracking Light for Night Launched Model Rockets&quot; by Captain Forrest Mims. Mims became a regular contributor to &quot;Model Rocketry&quot;.

===Model rocket kits===

Manned space flight and the race to the moon in the 1960s made model rocketry a popular hobby. Roberts, Mims, Cagle and another Air Force officer from the Lab, Bob Zaller, decided they could design and sell electronics kits to model rocket hobbyists. Roberts wanted to call the new company Reliance Engineering, Mims wanted to form an acronym similar to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s MIT. Cagle came up with Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, MITS. The December 1969 issue of &quot;Model Rocketry&quot; (circulation 15,000) carried a press release that began:
Reliance Engineering in Albuquerque, New Mexico has announced the formation of a subsidiary company for the manufacture of miniaturized electronic and telemetry systems designed for model rockets. The company is called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). Reliance Engineering president Henry Roberts announced that &quot;MITS is presently conducting an intensive research program involving high quality miniature telemetry systems.&quot;
 The first commercially available model rocket telemetry transmitter is among the first items to be offered by MITS. Accessory modules including a tone beacon, temperature sensor, and a roll rate sensor, as well as tracking lights, ground systems for data reduction, and light weight, water activated batteries will soon be available. 

They designed and built the telemetry modules in their homes and garages but they were only able to sell a few hundred units. Mims had sold a feature article about the new solid-state device, light-emitting diodes, to &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; (circulation 400,000) that May. With the hope of selling kits to the larger readership; Roberts and Mims designed a device that would transmit voice over a beam of light, the Opticom. The editors accepted the project story and both articles were featured on the cover of the November 1970 issue. The payment for the articles was $400 but meeting Les Solomon, &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; technical editor, proved to be significant to both Mims and Roberts future success.

In August 1970, Les Solomon, his wife and daughter were on vacation in the southwest and arranged to visit Mims, Roberts and their families. At that time, Dan Meyer and Don Lancaster were among the most prolific authors in &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. Meyer had built a million dollar a year business that sold kits of parts to build the project that he and Lancaster wrote about. Mims and Roberts wanted to do the same and quizzed Solomon on the kit business. Solomon gave them some statistics but said there was no way of knowing how many kits an article would sell, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand.

MITS had purchased components to build 200 Opticoms but only sold around 100 units. Roberts wanted to design a new electronic calculator kit but his partners wanted out. Bob Zaller had already left MITS and Forrest Mims was out of the Air Force and wanted to become a full-time writer. Roberts bought his 3 partners out for $600 in cash and $350 in equipment. (Roberts&#x27; four-year commitment to the Air Force ended in mid-1972.) Mims and Roberts remained friends and collaborated on books, magazines and instruction manuals. 

== Calculators ==

Ed Roberts&#x27; interest in computers began in high school when he built a simple digital computer from relays. His first real experience with computers came while at Oklahoma State University where engineering students had free access to an IBM 1620 computer. Roberts&#x27; office at Weapons Laboratory had the state of the art Hewlett-Packard 9100A programmable calculator in 1968. In July 1970, a semiconductor company, Electronic Arrays, announced a set of six LSI ICs that would make a four-function calculator. Roberts was determined to design a calculator kit.

To fund the new project, Roberts sold 15% of MITS to fellow Air Force officer, Lieutenant William Yates. He also got an investment from another Weapons Laboratory officer, Major Ed Laughlin. Several other officers and scientist at the lab were interested in this state of the art calculator kit and helped with the design. Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual in return for a calculator kit.

The MITS 816 was known as a &quot;four-function&quot; calculator; it could add, subtract, multiply and divide. The display was only 8-digits but the calculations were done to 16-digits of accuracy. The custom molded case gave the kit a professional appearance; the kit was $179 and an assembled unit was $275. The MITS 816 was featured on the November 1971 cover of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. Thousands of calculator orders came in each month, in contrast to poor results for previous kits that MITS had offered.

The steady flow of calculator sales allowed MITS to run full page advertisements in &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;, &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; and &quot;Scientific American&quot;. In the June 1972 &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;, MITS announced a 14 digit calculator (Model 1440) with memory and square root function for $199.95 kit and $249.95 assembled. The original 816 kit was reduced from $179 to $149.95. Both calculators could be controlled by upcoming programming unit.

The monthly sales reached $100,000 in March 1973 and MITS moved to larger building with 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) of space. To meet the demand for assembled calculators, an automated wave solder machine was installed. In 1973 MITS was selling every calculator they could make, 110 employees worked in two shifts assembling calculators.

The functionality of calculator ICs increased at a rapid pace and Roberts was designing and producing new models. The MITS 7400 scientific and engineering calculator was introduced in December 1972. It featured trigonometric functions, polar to rectangular conversion, two memories, and up to a seven-level stack. A kit with a three-level stack was $299.95 and an assembled unit with a seven-level stack was $419.95. The next month the Series 1200 four-function pocket calculators were announced. The six-digit model was $59.95 and the twelve-digit model was $99.95.

The Programmer accessory had been mentioned in the earliest advertisement but it was not featured until March 1974. This was the same size as a desktop calculator and could hold 256 programming steps. (It could be expanded to 512 steps.) It was limited to emulating calculator key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering hexadecimal key codes. The combination of the MITS 7440 calculator and the programmer was not nearly as sophisticated as the HP 9830 calculator but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.

=== MITS calculators ===
The feature and price information is from advertisements in &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; magazine (issue date shown). The 816 price is from the original article in &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;.
=== Price wars ===
Bowmar Instrument Corporation introduced the &quot;Bowmar Brain&quot;, a four-function pocket calculator, in September 1971 and the $179 calculator sold over 500,000 copies in the first year. Bowmar then developed the &quot;901B&quot; calculator that was priced at $120. In September 1972, Texas Instruments (TI) introduced the TI-2500 portable four-function calculator that also sold for $120. The 901B and the TI-2500 both used the TI TMS0100 family of &quot;calculator-on-a-chip&quot; integrated circuit. TI was now directly competing with their IC customers. Other semiconductor companies such as National Semiconductor and Rockwell began selling calculators. Commodore Business Machines and other office equipment companies also got into the market. A frenzied price war started. By early 1974, Ed Roberts found he could purchase a calculator in a retail store for less than his cost of materials. The larger companies could sell below cost to win market share. Bowmar lost $20 million in 1974 and filed for bankruptcy. Commodore acquired their IC supplier, MOS Technology. Texas Instruments won the price war but their calculator division lost $16 million in 1975.

To compete in this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock offering of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused a stock market downturn and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS to pay off the existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads in the back of the magazine.

MITS was now $300,000 in debt and Roberts was looking for a new hit product. He decided to return to the kit market with a low cost computer. The target customer would think that &quot;some assembly required&quot; was a desirable feature. Roberts had looked at the Intel 4004 for calculators and thought the Intel 8008 was limited and difficult to work with, so he chose the most recent 8080 as the basis for his machine. The target price of this complete computer kit had to be under $400. To meet this price, Roberts agreed to order 1000 microprocessors from Intel for $75 each. Roberts and his head engineer, Bill Yates, began designing the computer. The company was down to 20 employees and a bank loan for $60,000 financed the design and initial production of the new computer.

==&quot;Popular Electronics&quot; and &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;==
In January 1972, &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; changed its editorial focus in an attempt to attract more advertising revenues. Reviews of stereo equipment and citizens band radio were featured; experimenter and constructions projects were gone. Dan Meyer, Don Lancaster, Forrest Mims, John Simonton and many other authors immediately started contributing to the competing &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; magazine. The June 1972 cover story was &quot;Experimenting with a $32 Solid State Laser&quot; by Forrest Mims. Another article in that issue was &quot;Experiments with Op-Amps&quot; by B.R. Rogen; this was a pseudonym of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; technical editor, Les Solomon. Solomon wrote articles for &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; while working for &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. Lou Garner, the longtime solid-state editor, moved to &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; for a year. Several MITS kit projects were featured in &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; including the ITC 1800 Integrated Circuit Tester (May 1972), the Model 1700 Function Generator (July 1973), the Model 1440 Calculator (July 1973) and the 88 VLCT Computer Terminal (November 1974).

&quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; had a smaller circulation than &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; but led the way with innovative construction projects between 1972 and 1975. John Simonton&#x27;s first modular electronic music synthesizer was featured on the cover of the May 1973 issue. It sold for a fraction of commercial synthesizers and his PAiA Electronics produced them for decades. Don Lancaster&#x27;s TV Typewriter in September 1973 and Jon Titus&#x27;s Mark-8 computer in July 1974 were the catalyst of the home computer revolution.

Art Salsberg became the editor of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; in 1974 with a goal of reclaiming the lead in projects. He wanted to publish a computer project that was more functional and elegant than the Mark-8. Les Solomon knew MITS was working on an Intel 8080 based computer project and thought Roberts could provide the project for the always popular January issue.

Ed Roberts and Bill Yates finished the first prototype in October 1974 and shipped it to &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; in New York via the Railway Express Agency. However, it never arrived due to a strike by the shipping company. Solomon already had a number of pictures of the machine and the article was based on them. Roberts got to work on building a replacement. The computer on the magazine cover is an empty box with just switches and LEDs on the front panel. The finished Altair computer had a completely different circuit board layout than the prototype shown in the magazine.

== Altair computer ==

=== Products ===
The Altair 8800 was modeled after early 1970s minicomputers such as the Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched paper tape. More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.

The Altair 8800 kit came with a front panel, a CPU board with the Intel 8080 microprocessor, 256 bytes of RAM, a 4-slot backplane and an 8-amp power supply for $439. A 1k byte memory board was $176 and the 4k byte was $264. The serial interface board was $124 and the parallel interface was $119. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was $1500. There was a special price for an 8k byte system with Altair BASIC (Microsoft&#x27;s first ever product) for $995. Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote Altair BASIC with Monte Davidoff contributing the Floating-point arithmetic routines. Altair BASIC initial developed from February 1975 to May 1975 and announced by MITS in July 1975, the 4k version on paper tape for $150, the 8k version with cassette support for $200 and the Extended 16k version with disk support (December 1975) for $350. To encourage selling more boards, Altair BASIC was discounted to $60, $75, $150 respectively, when bundled with 4k, 8k and I/O boards

When the January 1975 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; reached readers in mid December 1974, MITS was flooded with orders. They had to hire extra people just to answer the phones. In February, MITS received 1,000 orders for the Altair 8800. The quoted delivery time was 60 days but it was many more months before the machines were shipped. By August 1975, they had shipped over 5,000 computers.

The Altair 8800 computer was a break-even sale for MITS. They needed to sell additional memory boards, I/O boards and other options to make a profit. The April 1975 issue of the MITS newsletter, &quot;Computer Notes&quot;, had a page-long price list that offered over 15 optional boards. The delivery time given was 60 or 90 days, but many items were never produced and dropped from future price lists. Initially, Roberts decided to concentrate on production of the computers. Prompt delivery of optional boards did not occur until October 1975. 

The Intel 8080 did not have dedicated circuitry to support dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) because in 1975, this type of memory was still a new technology. MITS wanted to use DRAM because it consumed less power than static RAM. However, they had several design and component problems that led to a high failure rate with their 4K Dynamic RAM board. By July, new companies such as Processor Technology were selling 4K Static RAM boards with the promise of reliable operation. MITS released its own 4K Static RAM board in January 1976.

The only floppy disk drives that were readily available in 1975 were IBM compatible 8-inch drives. MITS selected the Pertec FD400 disk drive which could store over 300,000 bytes of data. The Altair disk controller occupied two boards and had over 60 ICs. The initial units were to be available in August, but were delayed until the end of 1975. The production version of Extended Disk BASIC was released in April 1976. The controller with one disk drive sold for $1,480 (kit) and $1,980 (assembled).

=== Marketing ===

The first full page advertisements for the Altair computer appeared in the February issues of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; and &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; magazines. Soon MITS was advertising in technical journals such as the IEEE &quot;Computer&quot;, and general interest magazines such as &quot;Scientific American&quot;. MITS was also the most prominent advertiser in the new hobbyist computer magazines such as &quot;Creative Computing&quot; and &quot;Byte&quot;.

David Bunnell joined MITS as a technical writer in the calculator heyday. In April 1975 he created a newsletter so the MITS staff could easily communicate with the customers. The newsletter, &quot;Computer Notes&quot;, was available to customers and other interested readers. It was a large format newsletter; 11.25 by 15.5 inches (286 by 394 mm), and each issue had 8 to 24 pages. In January 1977, it switched to a smaller magazine format and the last issue was produced in January 1978. Bunnell started &quot;Personal Computer&quot; magazine in October 1976 and went on to a successful career as a magazine publisher.

&quot;Computer Notes&quot; featured a wide variety of authors. Bill Gates and Paul Allen were regular contributors to the early issues. They wrote about Altair Basic and general software topics. Ed Roberts wrote a monthly &quot;Letter from the President&quot; column where he would answer customer questions and even review competing products. MITS engineers, such as Tom Durston and Steve Pollini, would give technical descriptions of new products. Altair owners would contribute software and hardware suggestions and occasionally a complete article.

MITS purchased a camper van in April 1975 and outfitted it with an Altair system complete with floppy disk, a Teletype Model 33 and every accessory MITS produced. The &quot;MITS-MOBILE&quot; was literally a showroom on wheels that would travel from city to city showcasing the MITS product line. They would hold seminars at hotel conference rooms that would draw crowds of over 200 people. The most notable seminar was at Rickey&#x27;s Hyatt House in Palo Alto, California in early June 1975, where a member of the Homebrew Computer Club left with an unreleased copy of Altair BASIC. After retail computer stores were established in most cities, the &quot;MITS-MOBILE&quot; was retired.

The first (and only) World Altair Computer Convention was held in Albuquerque, New Mexico in March 1976. The convention, organized by David Bunnell, was an overwhelming success; with 700 people from 46 states and seven countries attending. Many of the attendees would go on to become leaders of the personal computer revolution. 
=== Clones ===
Owners of mainframe systems and minicomputers could purchase additional memory, interface boards and peripherals from third party suppliers; so it was predictable that owners of the Altair 8800 computer would do the same. MITS&#x27;s delays in delivery of systems and accessories accelerated the formation of Altair compatible suppliers. The first ones started appearing in mid-1975 and by July 1976 complete computer systems were readily available. The technical manuals for the Altair 8800 provided electrical schematics of the 100 pin computer bus allowing others to design compatible boards. There was not a proper technical standard at the time and some &quot;compatible&quot; boards did not work with other &quot;compatible&quot; boards. Later, the industry developed the S-100 bus standard.

Bill Godbout Electronics in Oakland, CA was the parts supplier to many of the hobbyists and students from Berkeley. George Morrow approached Godbout with several Altair compatible designs that Godbout agreed to produce and sell. The October 1975 Byte magazine carried an advertisement headlining &quot;Get your MITTS on a Godbout RAM kit.&quot; The 4K byte Altair compatible board was $131.07.

Godbout also sold components to Processor Technology for their 4K Static RAM board and serial / parallel interface board. Lee Felsenstein designed an Altair compatible video board that provided 16 lines of 64 upper and lower case characters on a black and white television. This $160 board became very popular and led to the Processor Technology Sol-20 Computer in 1976.

The IMSAI 8080, the first &quot;clone&quot; of the Altair computer, was released in December 1975. It corrected many shortcomings of the original Altair 8800 by providing a larger power supply, a 22 slot motherboard, and easier wiring of the front panel. Ed Roberts reviewed the IMSAI in his April 1976 column in &quot;Computer Notes&quot;, and agreed that the IMSAI was in some ways better than the original Altair. Roberts also pointed out that the new Altair 8800B was superior to the IMSAI 8080 and the upgraded Altair 8800A fixed the same issues that the IMSAI did.

Altair computers were only available from the 20 or so authorized Altair computer dealers, but the IMSAI 8080, Processor Technology Sol and many other clones were sold by hundreds of newly opening computer stores.

The S-100 bus was used throughout the 1980s until it was overtaken by the IBM PC ISA bus. Seattle Computer Products (SCP) was a manufacturer of S-100 memory boards. The company&#x27;s engineer, Tim Paterson, designed an Intel 8086 CPU system on two S-100 boards in 1979. Microsoft, then in nearby Bellevue, Washington, used the prototype machine to test their 8086 version of BASIC. Digital Research had promised to deliver an 8086 version of their CP/M operating system by December 1979 but missed that date. SCP needed a disk operating system to sell its 8086 products so Patterson wrote QDOS, a &quot;Quick and Dirty Operating System&quot; in three months. Microsoft would later purchase QDOS from SCP for $50,000 and use it as the basis for the IBM PC DOS.

=== Altair BASIC ===
In December 1974 Bill Gates was a student at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 computer in the January 1975 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted to be the first to offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC&#x27;s macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete. Gates and Allen worked at TRW where they had unlimited access to a PDP-10.

Harvard had a DEC PDP-10 that was available for student use. They would use it to develop BASIC. While Allen modified their development software for the new 8080 microprocessor, Gates began writing 8080 assembly language by hand on yellow legal pads. They enlisted another Harvard student, Monte Davidoff, to write the math routines.

By early February the program coding switched from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version was completed by March 1975. Gates and Allen had been in contact with Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed more time to get a computer with 7k bytes of memory working, and they needed more time to get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.

The April 1975 issue of the Altair Newsletter, Computer Notes, had a banner headline &quot;Altair BASIC - Up and Running&quot;. The software was to begin shipping on June 23, 1975. The software price was $500, but discounted to $75 with the purchase of an Altair computer with 8k bytes of memory and a serial I/O card.

On July 22, 1975 MITS signed a contract for the Altair BASIC with Bill Gates and Paul Allen. They received $3000 at signing and a royalty for each copy of BASIC sold; $30 for the 4K version, $35 for the 8K version and $60 for the expanded version. The contract had a cap of $180,000. MITS received an exclusive worldwide license to the program for 10 years. They also had exclusive rights to sub-license the program to other companies and agreed to use its &quot;best efforts&quot; to license, promote and commercialize the program. MITS would supply the computer time necessary for development; a PDP-10 owned by the Albuquerque school district. Paul Allen left his job at Honeywell and became the Vice President and Director of Software at MITS with a salary of $30,000 per year. Bill Gates was still a student at Harvard and just a contractor with MITS. The October 1975 company newsletter gives his title as &quot;Software Specialist&quot;.

The price of Altair BASIC to customers who purchased additional memory and I/O boards from MITS was $75. Users may have gone along with that if the memory board were reliable. Customers bought the computer from MITS, and working memory from companies like Processor Technology. Rather than pay $500 for BASIC, they would acquire bootleg copies of the software. Only about ten percent of the early customers actually purchased BASIC. With a royalty due of $30 per copy, Gates felt that the computer hobbyist were stealing money from him. In February 1976 Bill Gates, &quot;General Partner, Micro-Soft&quot;, wrote an &quot;Open Letter to Hobbyists&quot; that was sent to every computer publication insinuating that the hobbyists were thieves.

MITS had announced a new computer based on the Motorola 6800 microprocessor in November 1975, the . The machines were supposed to ship in January 1976, but hardware design problems delayed shipment until May. Paul Allen rewrote their 8080 simulator to support the 6800 microprocessor. Ric Weiland, a high school friend of Gates and Allen, converted the Altair BASIC&#x27;s 8080 assembly language to 6800 assembly language. To eliminate the per copy royalty loss issue, the 6800 BASIC was licensed to MITS on a non-exclusive basis for a flat fee of $31,200. Weiland and Marc McDonald were impressed with the new MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor that was a derivative of the 6800. They modified the 6800 development system to support the 6502 and &quot;cranked out&quot; a 6502 edition of BASIC. This version was later sold to Commodore and Apple.

The January 1976 issue of MITS&#x27;s newsletter, Computer Notes, carried an ad for 8080 BASIC. The last paragraph stated: &quot;Licenses for source listing and rights to distribute the binaries are also available to OEM buyers. Write or call Mr. Paul Allen at the MITS plant in Albuquerque for more detailed information.&quot; Microsoft found several corporate customers for BASIC and proceeds were evenly split with MITS. Pertec acquired MITS in December 1976 and refused to allow any more OEM deals, even though the agreement required MITS to use their &quot;best efforts&quot; to license the software. The contract required MITS and Microsoft to use binding arbitration to settle disputes. In September 1977, the arbitrator ruled in favor of Microsoft, MITS could continue to use BASIC on their machines but lost the exclusive license. Microsoft could license the software to anyone and keep all of the royalties.

There was no longer a business requirement to remain in Albuquerque so Microsoft wanted to relocate to a larger city that would be more attractive to new employees. The San Francisco bay area was considered but Allen and Gates decided to return home to Seattle. Microsoft moved to Bellevue, Washington in January 1979.

== Sale to Pertec ==

In 1976, MITS had 230 employees and sales of $6 million. Roberts was tiring of his management responsibilities and was looking for a larger partner. MITS had always used Pertec Computer Corporation disk drives and on December 3, 1976, Pertec signed a letter of intent to acquire MITS for $6 million in stock. The deal was completed in May 1977 just before the National Computer Conference in Dallas, Texas. Roberts got $2 million and the other 500 MITS shareholders (including the Altair co-designer, William Yates) split the rest.

Pertec was eager to increase sales to small businesses through the 26 Altair Computer stores across the United States. The marketing toward hobby/home user was curtailed. The November 1977 issue of the MITS newsletter, Computer Notes, was the last produced by the Albuquerque staff. There was one more issue produced by the Pertec staff in Chatsworth, California. The back cover of the leading home computer magazine, Byte, always carried a full page Altair advertisement. This ended with the September 1977 issue. Roberts and Yates stayed on and worked on special projects.

In August 1979, Pertec agreed to sell a 45% stake to North American Philips for $37 million. Before the deal was complete, Pertec agreed to be acquired by the West German computer company, Triumph-Adler, for $120 million. In 1978, Pertec had sales of $150 million and Triumph-Adler had sales of $466 million.

The Altair products were merged into the Pertec line and the MITS facility was used to produce the PCC-2000 small-business computer. The Albuquerque plant was closed in December 1980 and the production was moved to Pertec plants in Irvine, California.

By the end of 1977 Roberts left MITS and returned to Georgia to be a gentleman farmer. He studied medicine at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia and graduated with a M.D. in 1986. Roberts practiced medicine in Cochran, Georgia, population 4500, until his death in 2010.

<text>Webvan was a dot-com company and grocery business that filed for bankruptcy in 2001 after 3 years of operation. It was headquartered in Foster City, California, United States. It delivered products to customers&#x27; homes within a 30-minute window of their choosing. At its peak, it offered service in ten US areas: the San Francisco Bay Area; Dallas; Sacramento; San Diego; Los Angeles; Orange County, California; Chicago; Seattle; Portland, Oregon; and Atlanta, Georgia. The company had hoped to expand to 26 cities by 2001.

Long after the failure of Webvan, the concept of companies delivering groceries very quickly grew from about 2020, and several companies were vying for business from dark stores.

==History==

Webvan was founded in the heyday of the dot-com bubble in 1996 by Louis Borders, who also co-founded Borders in 1971.

===Growth===
The company&#x27;s investors pressured it to grow very fast to obtain first-mover advantage. This rapid growth was cited as one of the reasons for the downfall of the company. Webvan started taking orders in the San Francisco Bay Area in June 1999.

Webvan placed a $1 billion order with Bechtel to build its warehouses, and bought a fleet of delivery trucks. In 2000, Webvan bought HomeGrocer, a competitor that was also losing money, for $1.2 billion in stock. At its peak in 2000, Webvan had $178.5 million in sales but it also had $525.4 million in expenses.

===Financing===
Benchmark Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Borders each invested $3.5 million in the company in a Series A round in 1997, buying shares for $9.58 each. Sequoia later invested another $50 million, Softbank Capital later invested $160.3 million, and Goldman Sachs&#x27; venture arm invested $50 million. E-Trade and Yahoo! each invested $10 million. In total, venture capitalists invested more than $396 million in Webvan.

The company raised an additional $375 million in an initial public offering in November 1999, during the dot-com bubble that valued the company at more than $4.8 billion. Up to that time, the company had reported cumulative revenue of $395,000 and cumulative net losses of more than $50 million.

===Management===
None of Webvan&#x27;s senior executives or major investors had any management experience in the supermarket industry, including its CEO George Shaheen, who had resigned as head of Andersen Consulting (now Accenture), a management consulting firm, to join the venture. Webvan had a contract to pay Shaheen, who gave up a $4 million per year salary at Andersen, $375,000 per year for life. When the company filed bankruptcy in July 2001, Shaheen was an unsecured creditor. Shaheen resigned in April 2001, while the company was on the verge of shutting down.

===Bankruptcy===
The company lost over $800 million and shut down in June 2001, filing for bankruptcy and laying off 2,000 employees. As part of its shutdown process, all non-perishable food was donated to local food banks.

==Reasons for failure==

Commentators point to several reasons for Webvan&#x27;s failure:
* Aggressive expansion to many cities without proving its business model in its first market
* A business model targeting price-sensitive mass-market consumers rather than upmarket consumers who would be more profitable
* Building its own warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure from scratch, in contrast to services such as Peapod which survived the dot-com bust and used the infrastructure of existing supermarkets (as did the later Instacart)

CNET named Webvan one of the largest dot-com flops in history.

==Legacy==
A large number of Webvan&#x27;s colored plastic shipping tubs are now used for household storage. The company&#x27;s distinctively shaped vans, now repainted, are still seen.

Some executives of the company went to work for Amazon.com.

From about 2020 many companies were vying to provide ultrafast delivery, similar to the Webvan concept.

<text>Omethoate (C5H12NO4PS) is a systemic organophosphorous insecticide and acaricide available as a soluble concentrate. It is used to control insects and mites in horticulture and agriculture, as well as in the home garden.

Omethoate works by inhibiting the enzyme 
acetylcholinesterase. This inhibition over-stimulattes parts of the nervous system that 
rely on acetylcholine to transmit nerve impulses. 

It is an irritant to the skin and mucous membranes.
Its toxicity and hazard potential are still under review because of concerns about its safety. Additionally, it cannot be used on food products.

<text>The &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot; III (StuG III) was an assault gun produced by Germany during World War II. It was the most-produced German fully tracked armoured fighting vehicle, and second-most produced German armored combat vehicle of any type after the Sd.Kfz. 251 half-track. It was built on a slightly modified Panzer III chassis, replacing the turret with an armored, fixed superstructure mounting a more powerful gun. Initially intended as a mobile assault gun for direct-fire support for infantry, the StuG III was continually modified, and much like the later &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; vehicles, was employed as a tank destroyer.

==Development==
The &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot; originated from German experiences in World War I, when it was discovered that, during the offensives on the Western Front, the infantry lacked the means to engage fortifications effectively.

The artillery of the time was heavy and not mobile enough to keep up with the advancing infantry to destroy bunkers, pillboxes, and other minor fortifications with direct fire. Although the problem was well known in the German army, it was General Erich von Manstein who is considered the father of the &quot;Sturmartillerie&quot; (assault artillery). The initial proposal was from von Manstein and submitted to General Ludwig Beck in 1935, suggesting that &quot;Sturmartillerie&quot; units should be used in a direct-fire support role for infantry divisions.

On 15 June 1936, Daimler-Benz AG received an order to develop an armoured infantry support vehicle capable of mounting a calibre artillery piece. The gun mount&#x27;s fixed, fully integrated casemate superstructure was to allow a limited traverse of a minimum of 25° and provide overhead protection for the crew. The height of the vehicle was not to exceed that of the average soldier.

Daimler-Benz AG used the chassis and running gear of its recent Panzer III medium tank as the basis for the new vehicle. Prototype manufacture was passed over to Alkett, which produced five prototypes in 1937 on Panzer III Ausf. B chassis. These prototypes featured a mild steel superstructure and a Krupp short-barrelled, howitzer-like in appearance, 7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24 cannon. Production vehicles with this gun were known as &quot;Gepanzerte Selbstfahrlafette für Sturmgeschütz 7.5 cm Kanone Ausführung A bis D (Sd.Kfz.142)&quot;.

While the StuG was considered self-propelled artillery, it was not clear which land combat arm of the German Army would handle the new weapon. The &quot;Panzerwaffe&quot; (armoured corps), the natural user of tracked fighting vehicles, had no resources to spare for the formation of StuG units and neither did the infantry. It was agreed that it would best be employed as part of the artillery arm. The StuGs were organized into battalions (later renamed &quot;brigades&quot; for disinformation purposes) and followed their own doctrine. Infantry support using direct fire was its intended role. Later, there was also a strong emphasis on its use as an anti-tank gun.

As the StuG was designed to fill an infantry close support combat role, early models were fitted with a howitzer-pattern, low-velocity 7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24 gun, similar to those used by the earliest versions of the fully turreted Panzer IV. Low-velocity shells are lightly built of thin steel and carry a large charge of explosive, to destroy soft-skin targets and blast fortifications. Such shells do not penetrate armour well. After the Germans encountered the Soviet KV-1 and T-34 tanks, the StuG was equipped with a high-velocity 7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43 main gun (spring 1942) and in the autumn of 1942 with the slightly longer 7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48 gun. These high-velocity guns were the same as those mounted on the Panzer IV for anti-tank use but the heavy steel wall high-velocity shells contained much less explosives and had a lower blast effect for use against infantry or field fortifications. These versions were known as the &quot;7.5 cm Sturmgeschütz 40 Ausf.F&quot;, &quot;Ausf. F/8&quot; and &quot;Ausf. G (Sd.Kfz.142/1)&quot;.

Beginning with the StuG III Ausf. G from December 1942, a 7.92 mm MG34 machine gun could be mounted on a shield on top of the superstructure for added anti-infantry protection. Some of the F/8 models were retrofitted with a shield. An additional coaxial 7.92 mm MG34 started to appear in 1944 and became standard on all production during the same year.

The vehicles of the &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot; series were cheaper and faster to build than contemporary German tanks; at 82,500 RM, a StuG III Ausf G was cheaper than a Panzer III Ausf. M, which cost 103,163 RM. This was due to the omission of the turret, which greatly simplified manufacture and allowed the chassis to carry a larger gun.

==Operational history==

The &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot; III-series of vehicles proved very successful and served on all fronts, from Russia to North Africa and Western Europe to Italy, as assault guns and tank destroyers. Because of their low silhouette, StuG IIIs were easy to camouflage and hide, and were difficult targets to destroy. By the end of the war 11,300 StuG IIIs and StuH 42s had been built., but due to heavy losses, there were only 1,053 StuG IIIs and 277 StuH 42s remaining in German service by 10 April 1945. The StuG assault guns were cost-effective compared with the heavier German tanks such as the Tiger I and the Panther, although as anti-tank guns they were best used defensively as the lack of a traversable turret and their generally thin armour was a severe disadvantage in the attack role. As the situation for the German military deteriorated further later in the war, more StuGs were built than tanks, particularly due to ease of production.

In Italy, the Sturmgeschütz was highly valued by crews fighting Allied armour, but was dogged by mechanical unreliability; particularly the delicate final drive units. The small box on the track cover, which was normally fixed on the engine deck, contained the track tools.

In 1943 and 1944, the Finnish Army received 59 StuG III Ausf. Gs from Germany and used them against the Soviet Union. Thirty of the vehicles were received in 1943 and a further twenty-nine in 1944. The first batch from 1943 destroyed at least eighty-seven enemy tanks for a loss of only eight StuGs (some of which were destroyed by their crews to prevent enemy capture). The later batch from 1944 saw no real action. After the war, the StuGs were the main combat vehicles of the Finnish Army up until the early 1960s when they were phased out. These StuGs gained the nickname &quot;Sturmi&quot; in the Finnish military, which can be found in some plastic scale-model kits.

One hundred StuG III Ausf. Gs were delivered to Romania in the autumn of 1943. They were officially known as TAs (or TAs T3 to avoid confusion with TAs T4 (Jagdpanzer IVs)) in their army&#x27;s inventory. By February 1945, 13 were still in use with the 2nd Armoured Regiment. None of this initial batch survived the war. Thirty-one TAs were on the Romanian military&#x27;s inventory in November 1947. Most of them were probably StuG III Ausf. Gs and a small number of Panzer IV/70 (V) (same as TAs T4). These TAs were supplied by the Red Army or were damaged units repaired by the Romanian Army. All German equipment was removed from service in 1950 and finally scrapped four years later due to the army&#x27;s decision to use only Soviet armour.

StuG IIIs were also exported to other nations friendly to Germany, including Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, and Spain. Hungary fielded its StuG IIIs against Soviet forces as they invaded their country in end-1944 up until early 1945. Bulgaria also received several StuGs from Germany but almost none saw service against the Soviets, the country having ended the alliance with Germany by switching sides to the Allies before the Soviets invaded. Post-WWII, these were used for a short time before being turned into fixed gun emplacements on the Krali Marko Line on the border with neighbouring Turkey. StuG IIIs were also given to the pro-German Croatian Ustaše Militia, most of which were captured in Yugoslavia by Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav partisans during and after the war, as did German-operated vehicles. These were used by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army until the 1950s when they were replaced by more modern combat vehicles. Spain received a small number (around 10) of StuG IIIs from Germany during WWII, later sold to Syria between 1950 and 1960.
Italy received 12 StuG III Ausf.Gs previously owned by local German units in 1943. They were donated, along with 12 Panzer III Ausf.Ns, 12 Panzer IV Ausf.Gs and 24 8.8 cm Flak 37 complete with half-track tractors, to the Armored Division &quot;M&quot;, an intended elite unit composed by Blackshirts. With the fall of the Fascist regime and the Italian Armistice all equipment given to them was recovered by the germans and used against the Allies.

After the Second World War, abandoned German StuG IIIs remained behind in many European nations Germany had occupied during the war years, such as Czechoslovakia, France, Norway and Yugoslavia. The Soviet Union also captured hundreds of StuGs, most ending up being donated to Syria. An Italian 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine gun taken from Syrian Fiat G.55 was mounted on commander cupola with retrofitted anti-aircraft mount. Syria continued to use StuG IIIs along with other war surplus armoured fighting vehicles received from the USSR or Czechoslovakia (varying from long-barrelled Panzer IVs (late models) and T-34-85s) during the 1950s and up until the War over Water against Israel in the mid-1960s. By the time of the Six-Day War in 1967, many of them had been either destroyed, stripped for spare parts, scrapped or emplaced on the Golan Heights as pillboxes. Some remained in service up to the Yom Kippur War in 1973. None remain in service today. A few Syrian StuG IIIs ended up in Israeli hands and became war memorials or were simply left rusting away on former battlefields.

==Variants==
Production numbers were:

* StuG III prototypes (1937, 5 produced on Panzer III Ausf. B chassis): by December 1937, two vehicles were in service with Panzer Regiment 1 in Erfurt. Vehicles had eight road wheels per side with wide tracks, 14.5 mm thick soft steel superstructure and the 7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24 gun. Although not suitable for combat, they were used for training purposes as late as 1941.

* StuG III Ausf. A (Sd.Kfz. 142; January–May 1940, 30+6 produced by Daimler-Benz): first used in the Battle of France, the StuG III Ausf. A used a modified 5./ZW chassis (Panzer III Ausf. F) with front armour strengthened to 50 mm. The last six vehicles were built on chassis diverted from Panzer III Ausf. G production.
* StuG III Ausf. B: (Sd.Kfz 142; June 1940–May 1941, 300 produced by Alkett) Modified 7./ZW chassis (Panzer III Ausf. H), widened tracks (380 mm). Two rubber tires on each roadwheel were accordingly widened from 520 × 79 mm to 520 × 95 mm each. Both types of roadwheel were interchangeable. The troublesome 10-speed transmission was changed to a 6-speed one. The forwardmost return rollers were re-positioned further forward, reducing the vertical movements of the tracks before they were fed to the forward drive sprocket, and so reduced the chance of tracks being thrown. In the middle of production of the Ausf. B model, the original drive sprocket with eight round holes was changed to a new cast drive sprocket with six pie slice-shaped slots. This new drive wheel could take either 380 mm tracks or 360 mm wide tracks. 380 mm tracks were not exclusive to new drive wheels, as spacer rings could be added to the older sprockets. Vehicle number 90111 shows the older drive wheel with wider 380 mm tracks.
* StuG III Ausf. C: (Sd.Kfz 142; April 1941, 50 produced) Gunner&#x27;s forward view port above driver&#x27;s visor was a shot trap and thus eliminated; instead, superstructure top was given an opening for gunner&#x27;s periscope. Idler wheel was redesigned.
* StuG III Ausf. D: (Sd.Kfz 142; May–September 1941, 150 produced) Simply a contract extension on Ausf. C. On-board intercom installed, transmission hatch locks added, otherwise identical to Ausf. C.
* StuG III Ausf. E: (Sd.Kfz 142; September 1941February 1942, 284 produced) Superstructure sides added extended rectangular armoured boxes for radio equipment. Increased space allowed room for six additional rounds of ammunition for the main gun (giving a maximum of 50) plus a machine gun. One MG 34 and seven drum-type magazines were carried in the right rear side of the fighting compartment to protect the vehicle from enemy infantry. Vehicle commanders were officially provided with SF14Z stereoscopic scissor periscopes. Stereoscopic scissor type periscopes for artillery spotters may have been used by vehicle commanders from the start.
* StuG III Ausf. F: (Sd.Kfz 142/1; March–September 1942, 366 produced) The first real up-gunning of the StuG, this version uses the longer 7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43 gun. Firing armour-piercing Panzergranat-Patrone 39, the StuK 40 L/43 could penetrate 91 mm of armour inclined 30 degrees from vertical at 500 m, 82 mm at 1,000 m, 72 mm at 1,500 m, 63 mm at 2,000 m, allowing the Ausf. F to engage most Soviet armoured vehicles at normal combat ranges. This change marked the StuG as being more of a tank destroyer than an infantry support vehicle. A ventilation port and exhaust fan was added to the top of the turret to evacuate fumes from spent shells, to enable the firing of continuous shots. Additional 30 mm armour plates were welded to the 50 mm frontal armour from June 1942, making the frontal armour 80 mm thick. From June 1942, Ausf. F were mounted with approximately 13 inch (334 mm to be exact) longer 7,5 cm StuK 40 L/48 gun. Firing above mentioned ammunition, longer L/48 could penetrate 96 mm, 85 mm, 74 mm, 64 mm respectively (30 degrees from vertical).
* StuG III Ausf. F/8: (Sd.Kfz 142/1; September–December 1942, 250 produced) Introduction of an improved hull design similar to that used for the Panzer III Ausf. J / L with increased rear armour. This was 8th version of the Panzer III hull, thus the designation &quot;F/8&quot;. This hull has towing hook holes extending from side walls. From October 1942, 30 mm thick plates of additional armour were bolted (previously welded) on to speed up the production line. From F/8, the 7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48 gun was standard until the last of the Ausf. G. Due to the lack of double baffle muzzle brakes, a few L/48 guns mounted on F/8s were fitted with the single baffle ball type muzzle brake used on the Panzer IV Ausf. F2/G.
* StuG III Ausf. G (Sd.Kfz. 142/1; December 1942April 1945, ~8,423 produced, 142 built on Panzer III Ausf. M chassis, 173 converted from Panzer III): The final and by far the most common of the StuG series. Upper superstructure was widened: welded boxes on either sides were abandoned. This new superstructure design increased its height to 2160 mm. The back wall of the fighting compartment was straightened, and the ventilation fan on top of the superstructure was relocated to the back of the fighting compartment. From March 1943, the driver&#x27;s periscope was abandoned. In February 1943, Alkett was joined by MIAG as a second manufacturer. From May 1943, side hull spaced armour plates &quot;(Schürzen)&quot; were fitted to G models; these were primarily intended for protection against Russian anti-tank rifles, but were also useful against hollow-charge ammunition. Side plates were retrofitted to some Ausf. F/8 models, as they were to be fitted to all front line StuGs and other tanks by June 1943 in preparation for the battle of Kursk. Mountings for the &quot;Schürzen&quot; proved to be inadequate, as many were lost in the field. From March 1944, an improved mounting was introduced; as a result, side skirts are seen more often with late model Ausf G. From May 1943, 80 mm thick plates were used for frontal armour instead of two plates of 50 mm + 30 mm. However, a backlog of StuGs with completed 50 mm armour existed. For those, a 30 mm additional armour plate still had to be welded or bolted on until October 1943.

A rotating cupola with periscopes was added for the Ausf G.&#x27;s commander. However, from September 1943, the lack of ball bearings (resulting from USAAF bombing of Schweinfurt) forced cupolas to be welded on. Ball bearings were once again installed from August 1944. Shot deflectors for the cupolas were first installed from October 1943 from one factory, to be installed on all StuGs from February 1944. Some vehicles without shot deflectors carried several track pieces wired around the cupola for added protection.

From December 1942, a square machine gun shield for the loader was installed, allowing an MG34 to be factory installed on a StuG for the first time. When stowed this shield folded back, partially overlapping the front half of the loader&#x27;s hatch cover. A curved protrusion welded to the backside of the shield pushed the shield forward as the front half of the loader&#x27;s hatch cover was opened and guided the hatch cover to naturally engage a latch point on the shield thus, supporting the shield in its deployed position without exposing the loader to hostile forward fire. F/8 models had machine gun shields retro-fitted from early 1943. The loader&#x27;s machine gun shield was later replaced by rotating machine gun mount that could be operated by the loader inside the vehicle sighting through a periscope. In April 1944, 27 of them were being field tested on the Eastern front. Favourable reports led to installation of these &quot;remote&quot; machine gun mounts from the summer of 1944.

From October 1943, G versions were fitted with the &quot;Topfblende&quot; pot mantlet (often called &quot;Saukopf&quot; &quot;Pig&#x27;s head&quot;) gun mantlet without a coaxial mount. This cast mantlet, which had a sloped and rounded shape, was more effective at deflecting shots than the original boxy &quot;Kastenblende&quot; mantlet that had armour varying in thickness from 45 mm to 50 mm. The lack of large castings meant that the trapezoid-shape boxy mantlet was also produced until the very end. Topfblende were fitted almost exclusively to Alkett-produced vehicles.

A coaxial machine gun was first added to boxy mantlets, from June 1944, and then to cast Topfblende, from October 1944, in the middle of &quot;Topfblende&quot; mantlet production. With the addition of this coaxial machine gun, all StuGs carried two MG 34 machine guns from autumn of 1944. Some previously completed StuGs with a boxy mantlet had a coaxial machine gun hole drilled to retrofit a coaxial machine gun; however, Topfblende produced from November 1943 to October 1944 without a machine gun opening could not be tampered with.

Also from November 1943 onwards, all-metal return rollers of a few different types were used due to lack of rubber supply. Zimmerit anti-magnetic coating to protect vehicles from magnetic mines was applied starting in September (MIAG facility) or November (Alkett facility) 1943 and ending in September 1944.

===Further variants===

In 1942, a variant of the StuG Ausf. F was designed with a true howitzer instead of the 7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43 cannon. These new vehicles, designated StuH 42 (&quot;Sturmhaubitze 42&quot;, Sd.Kfz 142/2), were designed to provide infantry support with the increased number of StuG III Ausf. F/8 and Ausf. Gs being used in the anti-tank role. The StuH 42 mounted a variant of the 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer, modified to be electrically fired and fitted with a muzzle brake. Production models were built on StuG III Ausf. G chassis. The muzzle brake was often omitted due to the scarcity of resources later in the war. Alkett produced 1,299 StuH 42 from March 1943 to 1945, the initial 12 vehicles were built on repaired StuG III Ausf. F and F/8 from the autumn of 1942 to January 1943.

In 1943, 10 StuG IIIs were converted to the StuG III (Flamm) configuration by replacing the main gun with a Schwade flamethrower. These chassis were all refurbished at the depot level and were a variety of pre-Ausf. F models. There are no reports to indicate that any of these were used in combat and all were returned to Ausf. G standard at depot level by 1944.

In late 1941, the StuG chassis was selected to carry the 15 cm sIG 33 heavy infantry gun. These vehicles were known as Sturm-Infanteriegeschütz 33B. Twenty-four were rebuilt on older StuG III chassis of which twelve vehicles saw combat in the Battle of Stalingrad, where they were destroyed or captured. The remaining 12 vehicles were assigned to 23rd Panzer Division.

Due to the dwindling supply of rubber, rubber-saving road wheels were tested during 8–14 November 1942, but did not see production.

Bombing raids on the Alkett factory resulted in significant drops in StuG III production in November 1943. To make up for this loss of production, Krupp displayed a substitution StuG on a Panzer IV chassis to Hitler on 16–17 December 1943. From January 1944 onwards, the StuG IV, based on the Panzer IV chassis and with a slightly modified StuG III superstructure, entered production.

Field modifications were made to increase the vehicle&#x27;s survivability, resulting in diversity to already numerous variants; cement plastered on front superstructure, older Ausf.C/D retrofitted with a KwK 40 L/48 gun, Ausf.G mounting Panzer IV cupola, a coaxial MG34 through a hole drilled on a boxy mantlet, et cetera.

The Soviet SU-76i self-propelled gun was based on captured StuG III and Panzer III vehicles. In total, Factory #37 in Sverdlovsk manufactured 181 SU-76i plus 20 commander SU-76i for Red Army service by adding an enclosed superstructure and the 76.2 mm S-1 tank gun.

Approximately 10,000 StuG IIIs of various types were produced from 1940 to 1945 by Alkett (~7,500) and from 1943 to 1945 by MIAG (2,586). From April to July 1944, some 173 Panzer III were converted into StuG III Ausf. G. The 1,299 StuH 42 and the 12 conversions from StuG III were solely built by Alkett.

<text>The Dry River is a river in the extreme southeast of the North Island of New Zealand. It feeds into the Ruamahanga River to the southwest of Martinborough. The headwaters are in the Haurangi Forest Park, and its eventual outflow (via the Ruamahanga River) is into Cook Strait at Palliser Bay.

Dry River was the name of a sheep station about 1877, which later was renamed Dyerville. A vineyard called Dry River was established in the area in 1979.

<text>The Australian Astronomical Observatory (AAO), formerly the Anglo-Australian Observatory, was an optical and near-infrared astronomy observatory with its headquarters in North Ryde in suburban Sydney, Australia. Originally funded jointly by the United Kingdom and Australian governments, it was managed wholly by Australia&#x27;s Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education. The AAO operated the 3.9-metre Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) and 1.2-metre UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) at Siding Spring Observatory, located near the town of Coonabarabran, Australia.

In addition to operating the two telescopes, AAO staff carried out astronomical research, and designed and built astronomical instrumentation for the AAT, UKST, and other telescopes including the European Southern Observatory (ESO)&#x27;s Very Large Telescope in Chile, and the Japanese Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.

UK involvement in the AAO ceased in June 2010, with the change of name and management arrangements effective from 1 July 2010.

== History ==
In the years immediately after World War II optical observational astronomy in the UK was toiling due to a lack of modern infrastructure. There were no large telescopes in the southern hemisphere despite some of the most intriguing astronomical objects (e.g. the Galactic Centre and the Magellanic Clouds) being best placed for study from these latitudes. In the 1950s Richard Woolley, Director of Mount Stromlo Observatory from 1939 to 1956 and Astronomer Royal from 1956 to 1971, suggested constructing a large telescope in Australia.

After a series of meetings between British and Australian scientists in the early 1960s to discuss the technical specifications and begin the search for a suitable site for the proposed telescope, a formal approach was made to the governments of both countries in July 1965. It was finally agreed in April 1967 that the building of a 150&quot; telescope, the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT), should proceed. The telescope was to be located on Siding Spring Mountain in the Warrumbungles, which was owned by the Australian National University (ANU) and the site of some of their existing infrastructure.

Later that year an interim body known as the Joint Policy Committee, and including prominent scientists Edward Bowen (Aus), Olin Eggen (Aus), Richard Woolley (UK) and Jim Hosie (UK) was formed to oversee the early running of a project office which was located in Canberra. The project office finalised designs and specifications for the telescope, the mounting and the building and let contracts on a worldwide basis, exploiting the experience of those staff members who were involved in the development and construction of the Parkes radio telescope.

The Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement was signed on 25 September 1969 and came into effect on 22 February 1971. The Joint Policy Committee was replaced by the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board (AATB), an entity with full legal status under Australian law with responsibilities of overseeing the running of the telescope.

As construction of the AAT gathered pace, a heated debate ensued as to the details of the management structure which would control the telescope. Then Director of Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories, Olin Eggen and then Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, John Crawford, claimed that the bi-national agreement did not provide for the creation of a separate observatory. They argued that the telescope should ultimately be under the control of the Director of Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories and that additional staff for the new telescope should be provided by the ANU. However, fearing that they would be mere guests rather than equal partners in the AAT, British astronomers, with support from Australian state university astronomers, campaigned hard for a separate director and staff who were employed by and answerable only to the AATB. The matter was not settled until June 1973 when the Australian government endorsed the AATBs decision for an independent staff, marking the birth of the Anglo-Australian Observatory. The first director, Joe Wampler, took up his post in September 1974. To date there have been five directors.

== Construction of the Anglo-Australian Telescope ==

In late-1967 the contract for the primary mirror blank was awarded to Owens-Illinois, USA and the 27.5 ton structure was cast from zero-expansion Cervit glass in April 1969. The blank was shipped to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England to be figured and polished by Grubb Parsons The final product has a diameter of 3.9m and a focal length of 12.7m.

Construction of the building and dome, undertaken by the Australian companies Leighton Contractors and Evans-Deakin Industries respectively, began in late-1970 and was completed by the end of 1972. The building was manufactured from concrete, stands 26m high and has seven floors housing offices, labs and a mirror aluminising chamber. The telescope stands on a concrete pier with a separate foundation to the main building, to reduce the risk of vibrations. The double skinned dome is manufactured from both steel and aluminium and weighs 570 tonnes.

The telescope is mounted equatorially, loosely following the design of the 4m Kitt Peak National Observatory telescope. The mount was manufactured in Muroran, Japan by Mitsubishi Electric. It was shipped to Australia in early 1973 before being assembled at Siding Spring Mountain in April of that year. The telescope drive system was also produced by Mitsubishi Electric and delivered at this time. It was one of the first to be controlled by computer, an Interdata Model 70, and provided new levels of pointing and tracking precision. Assembly of the AAT was completed by 1974 and commissioning of the telescope began in April of that year. In total it took eight years to build at a cost of A$16 million. It was inaugurated by HRH Prince Charles on 16 October 1974 and went into general use in June 1975.

== Research with the AAT ==

The AAO has made use of optical fibres in astronomy for over 25 years. Instruments such as AAOmega, and its predecessor 2dF, use optical fibres to feed the light of stars and galaxies from the telescope into a spectrograph where it is dispersed into its component colours for detailed subsequent analysis. The broad field-of-view accessed by the 2dF and AAOmega instruments (4 times the width of the moon) and their 400 optical fibres, makes it feasible to spectroscopically survey large numbers of objects distributed across expansive areas of sky in a reasonable time frame.

A number of major studies undertaken with the AAT have exploited these capabilities. The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) used the 2dF instrument to obtain spectra and redshifts for ~250000 galaxies brighter than B~19.5 over ~7% of the southern sky in only ~270 nights. The 2dFGRS sample size was an order of magnitude greater than those of previous surveys, allowing a rigorous evaluation of cosmological parameters. For example, the survey has refined estimates of the mass density of the Universe, provided a determination of the fraction of baryonic matter in the Universe and set an upper limit on the total mass of neutrinos. In addition 2dFGRS yielded an independent estimate of the Hubble constant, which was in excellent agreement with value determined by the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project.

The ongoing WiggleZ project is using the AAT and AAOmega to measure the redshifts of ~200000 distant luminous blue star forming galaxies distributed over an area of ~5000 times the area of the moon. The primary goal of this study is to use an intrinsic feature in the distribution of galaxies as a &quot;standard ruler&quot; to relate distance to redshift and improve our knowledge of the nature of dark energy. This mysterious component of the Universe appears to be responsible for accelerating its rate of expansion.

Another AAOmega based survey on the AAT, Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA), is in the process of obtaining optical spectroscopy for ~250000 galaxies in the Local Universe. The AAOmega data will be used in conjunction with observations from satellite observatories such as the Herschel Space Observatory, and other telescopes around the world, to examine the predictions of the Cold Dark Matter standard cosmological model, like the relationship between the number density of dark matter halos and their masses and the relationship between the number density of galaxies and their masses as determined through studying their starlight.

The AAT also hosts a program to search for extrasolar planets, the Anglo-Australian Planet Search (AAPS). The AAPS exploits the high stability of the University College London Echelle Spectrograph (UCLES) to obtain the few metres per second precision in measurements of the line-of-sight velocities of stars necessary to detect the reflex Doppler motion induced by the presence of a planet. The AAPS has found more than 20 extrasolar planets, with masses ranging from ~10% to &gt; 10 times that of Jupiter.

== The Schmidt Telescope ==
The 1.2-metre UK Schmidt Telescope was built to complement the AAT and officially began operations in August 1973. It was designed for survey astronomy, having an extremely large field-of-view which is more than 12 times the apparent diameter of the moon. The telescope was operated by the Schmidt Telescope Unit of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh until 1988, when it was agreed that control would be handed over to the AAO.

The Schmidt has undertaken work including blue and red photographic surveys of the southern sky and the 6dF Galaxy Survey. Its multi-object spectroscopic capability is currently being exploited to perform the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey.

<doc id="643258" wikidata="Q1328380" url="?curid=643258" title="Battle of Inab">
<text>The Battle of Inab, also called Battle of Ard al-Hâtim or Fons Muratus, was fought on 29 June 1149, during the Second Crusade. The Zengid army of the atabeg Nur al-Din Zengi destroyed the combined army of Prince Raymond of Antioch and the Assassins of Ali ibn-Wafa. The prince was killed, and the Principality of Antioch was subsequently pillaged and reduced in size as its eastern border was pushed west.

==Background==
After the death of Nur ad-Din&#x27;s father Zengi in 1146, Prince Raymond of Antioch invaded the vulnerable province of Aleppo (part of the Seljuk Empire), which was threatened by hostile powers on all sides. After establishing his own authority in Aleppo and successfully defending Edessa in 1147, Nur ad-Din invaded Antioch in late 1148 and besieged Afamiya. Raymond beat him off and captured his baggage train. When he returned a few months later to attack Yaghra, Raymond, at the head of a small force, forced him to retire to Aleppo.

In June 1149, Nur ad-Din invaded Antioch and besieged the fortress of Inab, with aid from Unur of Damascus and a force of Turcomans. Nur ad-Din had about 6,000 troops, mostly cavalry, at his disposal. Raymond and his Christian neighbor, Count Joscelin II of Edessa, had been enemies since Raymond had refused to send an army to relieve besieged Edessa in 1146. Joscelin even made a treaty of alliance with Nur ad-Din against Raymond. For their part, Count Raymond II of Tripoli and Queen Melisende of Jerusalem refused to aid the prince of Antioch. Feeling confident because he had twice defeated Nur ad-Din previously, Prince Raymond struck out on his own with an army of 400 knights and 1,000 foot soldiers.

==Battle==
Prince Raymond allied himself with Ali ibn-Wafa, a leader of the Assassins and an enemy of Nur ad-Din. Before he had collected all his available forces, Raymond and his ally mounted a relief expedition. Amazed at the weakness of Prince Raymond&#x27;s army, Nur ad-Din at first suspected that it was only an advance guard and that the main Frankish army must be lurking nearby. Upon the approach of the combined force, Nur ad-Din raised the siege of Inab and withdrew. Rather than staying close to the stronghold, Raymond and ibn-Wafa camped with their forces in open country. After Nur ad-Din&#x27;s scouts noted that the allies camped in an exposed location and did not receive reinforcements, the atabeg swiftly surrounded the enemy camp during the night.

On 29 June, Nur ad-Din attacked and destroyed the army of Antioch. Presented with an opportunity to escape, the Prince of Antioch refused to abandon his soldiers. Raymond was a man of &quot;immense stature&quot; and fought back, &quot;cutting down all who came near him&quot;. Nevertheless, both Raymond and ibn-Wafa were killed, along with Reynald of Marash. A few Franks escaped the disaster. Much of the territory of Antioch was now open to Nur ad-Din, the most important of which was a route to the Mediterranean. Nur ad-Din rode out to the coast and bathed in the sea as a symbol of his conquest. 

The contemporary historian William of Tyre blamed the Antiochenes&#x27; defeat on Raymond&#x27;s rashness. One modern historian says the Crusader defeat at Inab was &quot;as disastrous at that of the Ager Sanguinis&quot; a generation earlier. Yet another remarks that it &quot;was not part of a watershed moment, and should not be seen in the context of the Second Crusade&quot;.

== Aftermath ==

After his victory, Nur ad-Din went on to capture the fortresses of Artah, Harim, and ‘Imm, which defended the approach to Antioch itself. Harim was not recovered until 1157, then lost permanently in 1164. He sent the main party of his army to besiege Afamiya. After plundering the region, he besieged Antioch, which was virtually defenceless because of the loss of its prince and its army. The city was divided between a surrender party and a resistance party. The former, led by Raymond&#x27;s widow, Constance, and the Patriarch, Aimery of Limoges, prevailed, and Nur ad-Din was bought off, with some of the treasure coming from the Patriarch&#x27;s own possessions. A small force was left behind to prevent reinforcements from entering the city, while Nur ad-Din went down to the sea to bathe in it as a sign of victory. He plundered the lands around Saint Simeon&#x27;s Monastery and then rejoined his forces to capture Afamiya.

Upon receiving news that King Baldwin III of Jerusalem was marching north with some Templars to relieve the siege, Nur ad-Din opened negotiations. The border between Antioch and Aleppo was re-drawn to Nur ad-Din&#x27;s gain and the armies went home. Joscelin now found that his enemy Raymond&#x27;s defeat and death placed his own possessions in extreme peril. Joscelin would soon be captured by Nur ad-Din (1150) and what remained of his County of Edessa was evacuated by its Latin inhabitants.

After the victory at Inab, Nur ad-Din became a hero throughout the Islamic world. His goal became the destruction of the Crusader states, and the strengthening of Islam through &quot;jihad&quot;; he had already set up religious schools and new mosques in Aleppo, and expelled those he considered heretics from his territory, especially Shiites. &quot;Jihad&quot; was influenced by the presence of the Christian Crusader states as it could be used as an excuse for maintenance of a permanent state of war. Nur ad-Din went on to capture the remnants of the County of Edessa, and brought Damascus under his rule in 1154, further weakening the Crusader states.

<text>Mount Stanley, also known as Mount Ngaliema (, , ), is a mountain located in the Rwenzori range. With an elevation of 5,109 m (16,763 ft), it is the highest mountain of both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, and the third highest in Africa, after Kilimanjaro (5,895 m) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m). The peak and several other surrounding peaks are high enough to support glaciers. Mount Stanley is named for the journalist and explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley. It is part of the Rwenzori Mountains National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Mt. Stanley consists of two twin summits and several lower peaks:

<text>The Missouri General Assembly is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Missouri. The bicameral General Assembly is composed of a 34-member Senate and a 163-member House of Representatives. Elections are conducted using first-past-the-post voting in single-member districts of roughly equal population. Members of both houses of the General Assembly are subject to term limits. Senators are limited to two four-year terms and representatives to four two-year terms, a total of 8 years for members of both houses. The General Assembly meets at the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City.

Polling from Saint Louis University showed that the General Assembly enjoyed a 45% approval rating in 2024, which was considered &quot;relatively high&quot; compared to other government institutions.

==Qualifications==
Members of the House of Representatives must be 24 years of age to be elected. Representatives also must be a qualified Missouri voter for two years, and a resident of the county or district of their constituency for one year. Senators must be 30 years of age, a qualified Missouri voter for three years, and similar to House qualifications, must be a resident of their senatorial constituency for one year prior to their election.

==Sessions and quorum==
According to Article III, Section 20 of the Missouri Constitution, the General Assembly must convene on the first Wednesday after the first Monday in January following the state general election. It adjourns on May 30, with no consideration of bills after 6:00 p.m. on the first Friday following the second Monday in May. No appropriation bill may be considered after 6:00 p.m. on the first Friday after the first Monday in May. If the Governor returns a bill with his objections after adjournment sine die, the General Assembly is automatically reconvened on the first Wednesday following the second Monday in September for a period not to exceed ten days to consider vetoed bills.

The Governor may convene the General Assembly in special session for a maximum of 60 calendar days at any time. Only subjects recommended by the Governor in his call or a special message may be considered. The President Pro Tem and the Speaker may convene a 30-day special session upon petition of three-fourths of the members of each chamber.

Neither the House nor Senate, without the consent of the other chamber, adjourn for more than ten days at any one time, nor to any other place than that in which the two houses may be sitting.

As a part-time legislature, compensation is low with the General Assembly, and most senators and representatives hold jobs outside their legislative duties. Lawmakers are paid about $35,915 per legislative year.

<text>Wallace John Eckert (June 19, 1902 – August 24, 1971) was an American astronomer, who directed the Thomas J. Watson Astronomical Computing Bureau at Columbia University which evolved into the research division of IBM.

==Life==
Eckert was born in Pittsburgh on June 19, 1902. Shortly thereafter, his parents John and Anna Margaret (née Heil) Eckert moved to Erie County, Pennsylvania, where they raised their four sons on a farm in Albion, PA. Wallace graduated from Albion High School in a class of six boys and eight girls. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1925, and earned an MA from Amherst College in 1926.

He started teaching at Columbia University in 1926, and earned his PhD from Yale in 1931 in astronomy under Professor Ernest William Brown (1866–1938).

He married Dorothy Woodworth Applegate in 1932. They raised three children, Alice, John and Penelope.

He was not related to another computer pioneer of the time, J. Presper Eckert (1919–1995).

He attended the launch of Apollo 14 just before his death August 24, 1971, in New Jersey.

A lunar crater, located within Mare Crisium, is named in his honor.

==Solution of differential equations for astronomy==
Around 1933, Eckert proposed interconnecting punched card tabulating machines from IBM located in Columbia&#x27;s Rutherford Laboratory to perform more than simple statistical calculations. Eckert arranged with IBM president Thomas J. Watson for a donation of newly developed IBM 601 calculating punch, which could multiply instead of just adding and subtracting. In 1937, the facility was named the Thomas J. Watson Astronomical Computing Bureau. IBM support included customer service and hardware circuit modifications needed to tabulate numbers, create mathematical tables, add, subtract, multiply, reproduce, verify, create tables of differences, create tables of logarithms and perform Lagrangian interpolation, all to solve differential equations for astronomical applications. In January 1940, Eckert published &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation&quot;, which solved the problem of predicting the orbits of the planets, using the IBM electric tabulating machines, based on the punched card. This slim book is only 136 pages, including the index.

==Naval service==
In 1940, Eckert became director of the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. World War II had been raging in Europe for many months. The US had not yet officially joined the effort to defeat Hitler. Nonetheless, the demand for navigation tables had risen. This demand helped inspire Eckert to automate the process of creating these tables, using punched card equipment. The 1941 almanac was the first to be produced using automated equipment, down to the final typesetting. Martin Schwarzschild became directory of the Columbia laboratory while Eckert was at USNO.

==Manhattan Project==
Columbia Physics professor Dana P. Mitchell served in the Manhattan Project (developing the first nuclear weapons) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. By 1943, the laborious simulation calculations used electromechanical calculators of that time operated by human &quot;computers,&quot; mostly wives of the scientists. Mitchell suggested using IBM machines like his colleague Eckert. Nicholas Metropolis and Richard Feynman organized a punched-card solution, proving its effectiveness for physics research. John von Neumann and others were aware of this &quot;computing by punched cards&quot;. That helped them develop wholly electronic electronic solutions which helped pave the way for modern computers.

==Watson laboratory==
After the war Eckert moved back to Columbia. Watson had just had a falling out with Harvard University over a project IBM had funded. IBM would instead focus their funding on Columbia, and Eckert&#x27;s laboratory was named Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory. Eckert understood the significance of his laboratory, keenly aware of the advantage of scientific calculations performed without human interventions for long stretches of computation. A massive machine built to Eckert&#x27;s specifications was built and installed behind glass at IBM&#x27;s headquarters on Madison Avenue in January 1948. Known as the Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator, it was used as a calculating device with some success, but served even better as a recruiting tool. Eckert published a description of the SSEC in November 1948.

As an employee of IBM, Eckert directed one of the first industrial research laboratories in the country. In 1945, he hired Herb Grosch and Llewellyn Thomas as the next two IBM research scientists, who both made significant contributions. When Cuthbert Hurd became the next PhD to be hired by IBM in 1949, he was offered a position with Eckert, but instead founded the Applied Science Department, and later directed the development of IBM&#x27;s first commercial stored program computer (the IBM 701) based on the demand demonstrated by applications such as those of Eckert.

In this period he continued his innovative contributions to computational astronomy by implementing Brown&#x27;s Lunar theory in his computer; developing the Improved Lunar Ephemeris; and performing the first numerical integration to compute an ephemeris for the outer planets.

In 1957, the Watson lab moved to Yorktown Heights, New York (with a new building completed in 1961) where it is known as the Thomas J. Watson Research Center. Eckert won the James Craig Watson Medal in 1966 from the US National Academy of Sciences.

<text>Jeremy Charles Sivits (December 10, 1979 – January 16, 2022) was a United States Army reservist. He was one of several soldiers charged and convicted by the U.S. Army in connection with the 2003–2004 Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in Baghdad, Iraq, during and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Sivits was a member of the 372nd Military Police Company during this time.

Sivits took photographs at the Abu Ghraib prison which became notorious after being aired on &quot;60 Minutes II&quot;. His father, Daniel Sivits, a former serviceman, said that he was trained as a mechanic, not a prison guard, and that he &quot;was just doing what he was told to do&quot;. Sivits was the first soldier convicted in connection with the Abu Ghraib incidents. 

He died from COVID-19 in Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania, on January 16, 2022, at age 42, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pennsylvania.

==Court martial==
On May 5, 2004, Sivits was charged under Uniform Code of Military Justice with conspiracy to maltreat detainees, maltreatment of detainees, and dereliction of duty for negligently failing to protect detainees from abuse, cruelty and maltreatment. His special court-martial was held on May 19, 2004, in Baghdad.

Sivits pleaded guilty and testified against some of his fellow soldiers. Sivits&#x27; testimony included reporting seeing Charles Graner punching a naked detainee &quot;with a closed fist so hard in the temple that it knocked the detainee unconscious&quot;. Sivits also testified seeing Lynndie England stomping on the feet and hands of detainees with her boots. Human Rights Watch and other human rights groups were not permitted to attend the trial.

The court martial sentenced Sivits to the maximum sentence, one year of confinement, in addition to being discharged for bad conduct and demoted from specialist to private.

After the Army, although a mechanic by trade, Sivits worked as substance abuse counselor. In a 2018 interview, Sivits showed remorse for his actions, claiming &quot;to hate himself&quot;.

Ambuhl entered military service on January 31, 2002. She attended One Station Unit Training at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, completing basic training around June 23, 2002. After completing Military Occupational Specialty training, she was released from active duty on August 23, 2002. In civilian life, Ambuhl was a histology technician at LabCorp in Herndon, Virginia.

Including Delayed Entry time, Ambuhl served in the United States Army Reserve for two years and nine months. On February 21, 2003, Ambuhl was activated for service in the Iraq War. In a stipulation made during court-martial proceedings, Ambuhl wrote that she &quot;received Geneva Convention and UCMJ training during an approximately 60–90 minute block of instruction in basic training, but cannot remember any specifics of those classes.&quot;

Ambuhl was originally assigned to the 352nd Military Police Company, but was involuntarily transferred to the 372nd Military Police Company. The 372nd Company spent three months training at Fort Lee, Virginia on Law and Order Missions.

In May 2003, Ambuhl and the 372nd Company arrived in Kuwait, proceeding north to Al Hillah in Iraq, where the company &quot;was responsible for, among other things, assisting and training the Iraqi Police in the surrounding area.&quot; On October 15, 2003, the company assumed duties at the Baghdad Central Confinement Facility (BCCF, better known as the Abu Ghraib prison) 12 miles west of Baghdad.

==Involvement in prisoner abuse==
From October 2003 to January 2004, Ambuhl worked at Abu Ghraib, primarily as a night shift guard for Tier 1B, which housed &quot;certain sub-categories of civilian detainees – including women, juveniles, and detainees suspected of psychiatric/psychological problems or mental instability,&quot; as well as &quot;detainees that had caused serious disciplinary problems.&quot; Ambuhl&#x27;s particular responsibility was to guard women and juveniles in Tier 1B. The 372nd Company was not trained in internment and resettlement (IR).

In her stipulation, Ambuhl admitted that between October 20 and December 1, 2003, she was derelict of duty in that she had &quot;willfully failed to protect Iraqi detainees from abuse, cruelty, and maltreatment.&quot; Specifically, Ambuhl stipulated that she witnessed &quot;numerous acts&quot; of abuse, cruelty, and maltreatment, writing that &quot;This time was very confusing for me, and things were done to detainees that I questioned, but that apparently were permissible. But there were some things that were done that I knew were wrong at the time, and I did not act to stop this behavior to protect the detainees.&quot;

Ambuhl was served with a court-martial in August 2004 in connection with prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. She was represented by a Washington, D.C.-based civilian lawyer, Harvey J. Volzer. A June 2004 &quot;Newsday&quot; article reported that Ambuhl, who had not yet appeared in any of the released photographs, was not involved in the incidents at Abu Ghraib:

A key part of the defense being prepared by Harvey Volzer, a lawyer for Spc. Megan Ambuhl, who England and another soldier both have said was not directly involved in the abuse. Volzer will argue Ambuhl could not have been derelict in her duty to guard prisoners because the memos show that the government believed the rough treatment to get information was justified. &quot;We have multiple legal memoranda ... condoning what these people did,&quot; he said.

In a &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; article, Volzer was quoted as saying:

They don&#x27;t have a case against her. They really don&#x27;t ... She&#x27;s not in any of the photographs you&#x27;ve seen or in any of the ones you haven&#x27;t. She&#x27;s not mentioned in any of the statements of doing anything other than being there. She&#x27;s being charged because everybody on the night shift was being charged.

Ambuhl appears in several of the photos relating to the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, published by Salon.com in March 2006, observing the incidents of abuse or administering injections. However, none of the photographs published by &quot;Salon&quot; appear to show her directly engaged in prisoner abuse.

As part of a plea agreement, Specialist Ambuhl was convicted by court-martial on October 30, 2004, for dereliction of duty. In punishment, she was demoted to Private, discharged from the Army, and docked half a month&#x27;s pay. Additional charges brought against Ambuhl were dropped following a pretrial guilty plea but had included allegations of conspiracy, maltreatment, and indecent acts. She was the third MP reservist and fourth U.S. soldier convicted in the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal.

==Marriage to Charles Graner==

In April 2005, she married Charles Graner, who was serving time for his role in the Abu Ghraib scandal. Graner had earlier been in a relationship with another soldier, Lynndie England and had one child with her. 

Because Ambuhl was not permitted to see him for the first 2½ years of his incarceration, it was a proxy wedding.

From 2005 onwards, she ran the now-defunct website, www.supportmpscapegoats.com (archived link), where she posted documents in support of her husband&#x27;s innocence. In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; web interview, she also stated: &quot;[Graner] should be let out now because he and the others in prison have served more prison time than any other soldier sentenced for similar cases [...] including murders.&quot;

<text>Orthorrhapha is a circumscriptional name which historically was used in entomology for an infraorder of Brachycera, one of the two suborders into which the order Diptera, the flies, are divided. As the group was paraphyletic, it has not been used in classifications in the last decade, and is effectively obsolete. However, many catalogs, checklists, and older works still contain the name. The taxa that used to be in the Orthorrhapha now comprise all of the infraorders in Brachycera excluding the Muscomorpha (= &quot;Cyclorrhapha&quot;).

The recent revision of the taxonomy of the order Diptera by Pape &quot;et al.&quot; revived the name Orthorrhapha.

<doc id="643298" wikidata="Q19931" url="?curid=643298" title="Elstree">
<text>Elstree is a large village in the Hertsmere borough of Hertfordshire, England. It is about northwest of central London on the former A5 road, that follows the course of Watling Street. In 2011, its population was 5,110. It forms part of the civil parish of Elstree and Borehamwood, originally known simply as Elstree.

The village often lends its shorter name to businesses and amenities in the adjacent town of Borehamwood, and the names of Elstree and Borehamwood are used interchangeably. Elstree is perhaps best known for multiple Elstree Film Studio complexes, where many films were made, including BBC Elstree Centre, where the TV soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; is shot. This production centre is actually in Borehamwood.

The local newspaper is the &quot;Borehamwood and Elstree Times&quot;. Together with Borehamwood, the village is twinned with Offenburg in Germany, Fontenay-aux-Roses in France, and Huainan in China.

== Transport ==

=== Elstree and Borehamwood railway station ===

Elstree &amp; Borehamwood railway station is on the Midland Main Line between London St Pancras and Bedford. It was built by the Midland Railway in 1868, and is located just north of the Elstree Tunnels.

The area of Borehamwood to the west of the railway line, formally Deacon&#x27;s Hill, is colloquially called &quot;Elstree&quot; even though it is not contiguous with the village. Elstree South Underground station was due to be an extension of the Northern line, planned in the 1930s, but never completed.

=== Road links ===
The old A5 road (Watling Street) goes through Elstree village, where it is designated as the A5183 road. Through the village, the road is called (from south to north) Elstree Hill South, High Street and Elstree Hill North. The 18th century Grade II listed building, Elstree Hill House, is still on Elstree Hill South, and used to be the home of the old Elstree School (see Schools). In the early 1900s, it was noted that:
:&quot;.. the hill roads are remarkably direct and seldom curve to avoid the steep pitch, and it has been suggested that the roads were originally slides for the timber which used to be sent to London for fuel.&quot;

=== Elstree Aerodrome ===
Elstree Aerodrome is licensed by the CAA and has a paved runway, suitable most for light aircraft and turbine powered G A aircraft. It also is one of the main helicopter centres for north London and is extending its provision in this area.
In the early 1930s it was a grass landing strip for the local Aldenham House country club. A concrete runway was put down during World War II, and Wellington Bombers were modified here. After World War II the airfield was initially used to fly in converted Halifaxes stacked with food supplies to supplement the depleted British stocks; however, after an overloaded plane damaged the runway it was no longer used for this purpose.

On 29 November 1975, retired Formula One race car driver and Embassy Hill car owner Graham Hill and his racing driver Tony Brise were piloting a twin-engine six-seat Piper PA-23-250 Aztec (N6645Y) from France to London with four additional team members aboard. All six were killed when it crashed and burned in heavy fog on Arkley Golf Course, short of the runway.

=== London Transport works ===
London Transport&#x27;s Aldenham Works was sited on the edge of Elstree close to the A41; it was opened in 1956, closed in 1986, and demolished in 1996. It is now a large business park.

=== Elstree Grange ===
Originally a 19th-century steam ship owned by the Houlder Brothers, the town also lends its name to a series of ships called the Elstree Grange (rebuilt 1916, 1944, 1979), at one time sunk during the Second World War.

== Buildings ==

=== Grade II listed buildings ===
Elstree is home to a number of Grade II listed buildings, including some at Grade II* (particularly important buildings), such as:
*Holly Bush public house (15th century)
*Aldenham House and stable block (c.1672)
*&quot;The Leys&quot;, built in 1901 by Scottish architect and designer, George Henry Walton.

=== The Manor hotel ===
The Manor hotel, formerly known as the Edgwarebury Hotel, is located on Barnet Lane. The Tudor-style building dates back to 1540, was converted into a hotel in the 1960s, and has featured in many TV and film productions, such as the 1968 Hammer Horror classic, &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot;. Notable guests have included Peter Sellers, Tom Cruise, John Cleese and Stanley Kubrick. It was the country home of armaments manufacturer and First Baronet Sir (Arthur) Trevor Dawson, (1866–1931).

=== Other buildings ===
A house in Elstree designed by architect Edward John May (1853–1941) was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1887. St Nicholas Parish Church was designed by English architect Philip Charles Hardwick.

=== Schools ===
Elstree is home to Aldenham School, and Haberdashers&#x27; Boys&#x27; School, both independent public schools (ie. fee-paying), Haberdashers&#x27; School for Girls, and St Nicholas Church of England V.A Primary School.

Just outside of Elstree, in the neighbouring town of Borehamwood, are lots of schools. There is Hertswood Academy, Elstree Screen Arts Academy – the vocational school linked with Elstree Studios.

There is also a Jewish high school called Yavneh College, Borehamwood. Yavneh was set up in 2013 by Dr Dena Coleman, ex-headteacher of Hasmonean High School. Dr Coleman was also a board-member of the Jewish National Fund. Just before her retirement in 2013, Dr Coleman died of Meningitis. Now, Yavneh College is headed up by Mr Spencer Lewis, ex-head teacher of King Solomon High School. Recently, the Yavneh Schools governors opened a primary school on the Hillside Avenue campuses. 
=== Earlier schools ===
Since the 1780s, a private school has been located in Elstree.

Elstree School, a boys&#x27; preparatory school, was located in Elstree from 1848 until 1938 before moving to Woolhampton, Berkshire before the outbreak of the Second World War.

Hillside School was located in Elstree between 1874 and 1886, before eventually becoming Dorset House School in 1905, (not to be confused with Hillside School in nearby Borehamwood.)

== Recreation ==

=== Sport ===
Elstree Cricket Club was formed in 1878, but no longer play in the Herts Saracens League. 18-hole Radlett Park Golf Club was founded in 1984, having recently being renamed from Elstree Golf &amp; Country Club. It is closer to Elstree than Radlett.

Hatch End Cricket Club also play in Elstree. They participate in the Herts Saracens League.

=== Leisure ===
Section 15 of the London Outer Orbital Path (London Loop) goes through Elstree, before continuing as Section 16, a 10-mile (16 km) walk from Elstree to Cockfosters.

=== Synagogues ===
Elstree was home to Ohr Yisrael Synagogue, an Orthodox synagogue with affiliation to the Federation of Synagogues. However, the synagogue&#x27;s present location is just within Borehamwood. The village currently sports two synagogues: The Shtiebel, an ultra-orthodox synagogue, and The Liberal Synagogue Elstree, just south of St. Nicholas&#x27; Church. According to census data, Elstree&#x27;s population, including the Deacon&#x27;s Hill area, was 36.0% Jewish, making it the only settlement with a Jewish plurality in the UK (the Christian population comprised 32.4% of the population). There is also 2 United Synagogue shuls in the area. One is on Croxdale road and the other is at Yavneh College, Borehamwood.

=== Parks ===
Aldenham Country Park is both a recreational facility and a breeding centre for rare livestock. Section 15 of the London Loop walk passes by. In 1873 nearby Tykes Water stream was dammed to create Tykes Water lake. Tykes Water Bridge features in the open credits to the Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee film, &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot;, and used in several episodes of the Diana Rigg and Linda Thorson seasons of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, including the final Thorson opening titles.
It also features in the film &quot;Mosquito Squadron&quot;.

=== Elstree Reservoir ===
The dam was built in 1795 by French prisoners of war. English watercolour landscape painter John Hassell writes:
:&quot;At the top of Stanmore Hill we enter on Bushy Heath, and at some distance on the right in the valley catch a view of the celebrated reservoir, the property of the Grand Junction Company, on Aidenham Common, at the foot of the village of Elstree. This noble sheet of water occupies a space of considerable extent on the verge of Aidenham Common, which thirty years ago was a barren waste; here the improvements in agriculture are indeed conspicuous, for at this place a poor, sandy, meagre, wretched soil has now by good husbandry been converted into rich pasturage.
:&quot;The reservoir has all the appearance of a lake; and when the timber that surrounds it shall have arrived at maturity, it will be a most delightful spot. From this immense sheet of water, in event of drought or a deficiency of upland waters, the lower parts of the Grand Junction and the Paddington Canals can have an immediate supply. The feeder from this reservoir enters the main stream near Rickmansworth, above Batchworth Mills, and supplies the millers&#x27; below with 300 locks of water, to whose interest the Duke of Northumberland is a perpetual trustee.&quot;
In 1886, the Photographic Society of Great Britain featured an exhibition of photos of Elstree Reservoir by Edgar Clifton. During World War I, then Major Keith Caldwell with No. 74 Squadron RAF, used Elstree Reservoir for target practice. In 1918, one of the pilots accidentally killed a local resident when his machine gun misfired.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Elstree&quot; derives from the Anglo-Saxon phrase for &quot;Tidwulf&#x27;s Tree&quot;, which is mentioned as &quot;&quot;Tidulfres treow&quot; &quot; in an 11–12th-century manuscript of an A.D. 786 charter. It is thought that &quot;the &quot;T&quot; [was] lost in the wrong division of &#x27;&quot;aet Tidwulfes treo&quot;&#x27; (&quot;at Tidwulf&#x27;s Tree&quot;).&quot;

A reference to a place in Hertford as &quot;Ilestre&quot; in 1460 may also be a variation. 

In 1723, topographer John Norden noted in his book &quot;Speculum Britanniae&quot;, that in the county of Hartfordshire was one &quot;Elstre or Eglestre&quot;. In an earlier edition, he writes:
:&quot;ELSTREE n. 20. in OFFAES grant EAGLESTRE
:&quot;Nemus aquilinum&quot;: a place wherit may be thought Eagles bredd in time past, for though it be nowe hilly and heathy – it hath beene replenished with stately trees, fit for such fowle to breede and harbour in. It is parcell of the libertie of &quot;S. Albans&quot;.
&quot;Nemus aquilinum&quot; is the Latin for &quot;grove of eagles&quot;.

&quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; author, Daniel Defoe wrote in his 1748 travel guide that:
:&quot;Idlestrey or Elstre, is a Village on the Roman Watling-street, on the very Edge of Middlesex; but it is chiefly noted for its Situation, near Brockly-hill, by Stanmore, which affords a lovely View cross Middlesex, over the Thames, into Surry.&quot;

In 1811, topographer Daniel Lysons writes:
:&quot;The name of this place has been variously written; — Eaglestree, Elstree, Ilstrye, Idlestrye, etc. Norden says that it is called, in Offa&#x27;s grant to the Abbey of St. Alban&#x27;s, Eaglestree, that is, says he, &quot;&quot;Nemus aquilinum&quot;, a &#x27;place where it may be thought that eagles bred in time past&#x27;.&quot; It has been derived also from Idel-street, i.e. the noble road; and Ill-street, the decayed road. May it not have been, rather, a corruption of Eald-street, the old road, i.e. the ancient Watling-street, upon which it is situated?&quot;

=== 5th century: Battle of Ailestreu (Elstree) ===
In the 5th century, British warlord Vortigern and his two sons, Vortimer and Catigern, took part in the Battle of Elstree, then called the Battle of Ailestreu, where the Saxon Horsa was killed. It&#x27;s possible there is confusion with the Battle of Aylesbury. George Moberly writes:

:&quot;Nennius, MHB p. 69, calls the place of battle where Hors fell Episford; Britannicè &#x27;Sathenegabail&#x27; = the Saxon battle. The Saxon Chronicle, ad a. 455, calls it Ægæles-threp, and Henry of Huntingdon, M.H.B. p. 708, Ailestreu. This would naturally be Elstree, of which name there is a place in Herts; but Beda&#x27;s description of its situation has caused it rather to be referred to Aylesford in Kent, near which is a small village called Horsted.&quot;

=== 16th–18th centuries ===
The Manor of Elstree was formerly included in the Manor of Parkbury, and belonged to the Abbey of St. Albans. On the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it was granted by Henry VIII, to Anthony Denny (1501–1549).

In 1607, Anthony Denny&#x27;s grandson Edward Denny sold part of the estate, with all manorial rights, to Robert Briscoe, who sold it the same year to Sir Baptist Hicks. Part of the estate became the Manor of Boreham, and was sold to Edward Beauchamp. It remained with the Beauchamp-Proctor family until 1748, when it was sold to James West, M.P. for St. Albans, who, in or about 1751, alienated it to a Mr Gulston of Widdial. Gulston then sold it to a Mr Pigfatt, a gunsmith, who, within a few years, conveyed it to Thomas Jemmet. In 1774 it was purchased from Mr Jemmet by the late George Byng, M.P. for Middlesex, who passed it on to his son, by which time the estate was called the Manor of Boreham.

In 1776, the House of Lords granted:
:&quot;An Act for dividing and closing the Common or Waste Ground, called Boreham Wood Common, in the Parish of Elstree otherwise Idletree, in the County of Hertford.&quot;

In 1796 topographer Daniel Lysons writes:
:&quot;The parish of Elstree contains about 3,000 acres of land, which is divided between arable and pasture nearly in an equal proportion. The soil is, for the most part, clay. Boreham Wood, a waste of nearly 700 acres, was inclosed about the year 1778, and is now in culture. This parish pays the sum of £151 11s 0d to the land-tax, which is raised by a rate of about 1s 9d in the pound&quot;.

=== The Elstree murder of William Weare ===

=== The Elstree murder of Eliza Ebborn ===
On 17 August 1882, Eliza Ebborn of Watford was murdered by 24-year-old shoemaker George Stratton, who was subsequently sentenced to death. She was buried at Elstree Parish Church.

== Administrative districts ==
Elstree used to be divided between the counties of Hertfordshire and Middlesex. The north part (which included the parish of Elstree) lay in the Hundred of Cashio, also known as the Liberty of St Albans, while the south part lay in the Hundred of Gore. The county boundary ran along the road from Watford to Barnet, now called Barnet Lane.

=== Elstree Rural District ===
From 1941 to 1974, Elstree Rural District was the local government area, before being abolished and merged with Hertsmere. On 20 March 1957, Armorial Bearings were granted. The arms and crest are described as follows:
:The background of royal ermine, represents the royal visits to and associations with the district, principally the visit of Henry VIII and his court to Tyttenhanger in 1525 to avoid the &quot;sweatinge sicknesse&quot; and the visits of Charles II to Salisbury Hall in Shenley. The oak tree with the Saxon crown represents Saxon Elstree – &quot;Tidwulf&#x27;s tree&quot; – around which the district has grown. The tree also represents Boreham Wood and the district&#x27;s woodlands, the gold acorns symbolize growth and prosperity. The waves at the base represent the River Colne, Aldenham Reservoir and link with the waves in the arms of the Hertfordshire CC and the Greater London Council.The gold saltire on blue is from the arms of the Abbey of St. Albans, the manor of Elstree came into the possession of the Abbey in 1188, and Tyttenhanger in Ridge stands on the site of a former possession of the Abbey, and the whole area lies in the Liberty of St. Albans. The scallop shells, the badge of pilgrims, recalls their passage along Watling Street through Elstree to St. Albans.
:The hart is from one of the supporters of the County Council arms, wearing a mural crown, symbol of civic government. The spool of film (unique in civic heraldry) recalls the industry which had made the name of Elstree and Boreham Wood so widely known in modern times.
:The motto is taken from the wall of Shenley Cage, and also links with the County motto &quot;Trust and fear not&quot;. &quot;

<text>Richard Preston Carlisle ( ; born October 27, 1959) is an American basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has previously served as head coach of the Detroit Pistons and Dallas Mavericks. As a player, Carlisle played for the Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, and New Jersey Nets. He is one of only 11 people to win an NBA championship as both a player and a coach.

==Playing career==
Carlisle was raised in Lisbon, New York. He attended Lisbon Central High School, then spent a year at Worcester Academy. Carlisle played two years of college basketball at the University of Maine from 1979 to 1981, before transferring to the University of Virginia. He was a starter for the 1982–83 Virginia Cavaliers team that featured the three-time college player of the year Ralph Sampson. UVA was the number one ranked team in the country prior to being defeated by Chaminade on December 23, 1982. In the 1983 NCAA tournament, UVA was the number one seed in the West and made it to the Elite Eight before losing to eventual NCAA national champion North Carolina State. Carlisle was the co-captain on the 1983–84 Cavaliers team and helped lead them to the Final Four where they lost 49–47 in overtime to the Houston Cougars team led by Hakeem Olajuwon. Carlisle averaged 12.5 points and 3.3 rebounds per game during his college career.

===NBA===
After graduating in 1984, Carlisle was selected 70th overall by the Boston Celtics in the 1984 NBA draft, where he played alongside Larry Bird. Under Celtics&#x27; coach K. C. Jones, Carlisle won the NBA championship in 1986 and lost in the finals in 1985 and 1987. In the 1986 NBA finals series, in limited playing time, Carlisle made every shot he took (3 for 3).

In a limited reserve role from 1984 to 1987, Carlisle averaged 2.2 points, 1.0 assists and 0.8 rebounds per game. He then played for the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) under Bill Musselman. Carlisle then signed as a free agent with the New York Knicks, where he played under coach Rick Pitino alongside emerging star Patrick Ewing. In 1989, Carlisle played in five games with the New Jersey Nets under Bill Fitch.

==Coaching career==
Later in 1989, Carlisle accepted an assistant coaching position with the Nets, where he spent five seasons under Bill Fitch and Chuck Daly. In 1994, Carlisle joined the assistant coaching staff with the Portland Trail Blazers under coach P. J. Carlesimo, where he spent three seasons.

In 1997, Carlisle joined the Indiana Pacers organization as an assistant coach under former teammate Larry Bird. During his time as Pacers assistant coach, Carlisle helped the Pacers to two of their best seasons ever. First, in 1997–98, the Pacers stretched the Chicago Bulls to the limit, narrowly losing the deciding seventh game of the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual NBA champion. Then, in 1999–2000 season, the Pacers made the NBA Finals for the first time, ultimately losing to the Los Angeles Lakers. Bird stepped down as coach and pushed for Carlisle to be selected as his replacement, but Pacers&#x27; team president Donnie Walsh gave the job to Isiah Thomas.

===Detroit Pistons (2001–2003)===
For the 2001–02 season, Carlisle was hired by the Detroit Pistons to be their new head coach. In two seasons as head coach, he led the team to consecutive 50–32 records (.610) with Central Division titles and playoff appearances. Carlisle was named Coach of the Year in 2002. However, the Pistons fired Carlisle after the 2002–03 season with a year remaining on his contract and hired Larry Brown. Friction between Carlisle and team ownership was cited as one of the primary reasons for the firing. Carlisle&#x27;s Pistons had just dispatched Brown&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers in the Conference Semifinals before being swept by the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference finals.

===Indiana Pacers (2003–2007)===

For the 2003–04 season, Carlisle returned to the Pacers as head coach to replace Isiah Thomas, who had been fired almost immediately after Larry Bird was brought back as the new President of Basketball Operations. In his first season, Carlisle led the Pacers to the Central Division title and NBA&#x27;s best regular-season record at 61–21 (74.4%), setting a franchise record for wins (both in the NBA and ABA). In the playoffs, the team eliminated the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat before losing to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals. That year, Carlisle coached the East All-Stars at the All-Star Game.

In 2005, the Pacers roster was decimated by injuries, most notably, those of Jermaine O&#x27;Neal, Stephen Jackson and Jamaal Tinsley, and suspensions from the Pacers–Pistons brawl at The Palace of Auburn Hills, which resulted in Ron Artest being suspended for the rest of the season, Jackson being suspended for 30 games, and O&#x27;Neal being suspended for 15 games. The Pacers still made the NBA playoffs that season. As the sixth seed, they again defeated the Boston Celtics in the first round before being defeated again by the eventual Eastern Conference champion, the Detroit Pistons.

The Pacers slipped to a .500 record in 2005–06 and barely made the playoffs, losing in the first round. Despite this, Bird and Pacers CEO Donnie Walsh did not hold Carlisle responsible for the Pacers&#x27; lackluster performances in the past two seasons, signing him to a multiyear contract extension and giving him the title of executive vice president of basketball operations.

After the Pacers finished the 2006–07 season with a 35–47 record, missing the playoffs for the first time since 1997, Bird fired Carlisle. Carlisle understood the decision, saying that the Pacers needed &quot;a new voice.&quot; In four seasons with the Pacers, he compiled a 181–147 record. The Pacers offered to let Carlisle stay on in the front office, but Carlisle also resigned that post on June 12, 2007.

After leaving Indiana, Carlisle worked as a studio analyst for ESPN before signing with the Dallas Mavericks as the team&#x27;s new head coach.

===Dallas Mavericks (2008–2021)===

====2008–2018: Dirk Nowitzki era====

On May 9, 2008, Carlisle signed a four-year deal with the Dallas Mavericks, replacing Avery Johnson.

In the regular season, the Mavericks finished with a record of 50–32. In the playoffs, the team pulled off a first round upset win against the San Antonio Spurs, then lost to the Denver Nuggets 1–4 in the Western Conference semifinals.

The next year, Carlisle coached the Mavericks to a 55–27 record, first in Southwest Division and second in the Western Conference, but lost in the first round to the Spurs in the 2010 NBA playoffs.

====2010–11 season: NBA championship====
The 2010–11 season was Carlisle&#x27;s most successful as a head coach. To strengthen the team, Dallas acquired Tyson Chandler, Peja Stojaković, Corey Brewer, J.J Barea and Ian Mahinmi. An existing core of Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Caron Butler, and Jason Kidd, the team had clear championship aspirations. To start the season, Dallas won 16 of its first 20 games in a competitive Western Conference. They finished the regular season with a 57–25 record.

In the first round, the Mavericks beat the Portland Trail Blazers four games to two. On May 8, 2011, they swept the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals. On May 25, 2011, the Mavericks got a 4–1 series win over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals. This marked Carlisle&#x27;s first Conference Finals victory of his coaching career, leading to his first NBA Finals appearance.

In the 2011 NBA Finals, Carlisle coached the Mavericks to a 4–2 series victory over the Miami Heat for the franchise&#x27;s first championship.

====2012–2018: Post–championship success====
In the 2012 playoffs, the Mavericks were swept by the Thunder in the first round. On May 15, 2012, Carlisle agreed to a new four-year deal with the Mavericks.

In 2013, the Mavericks finished 41–41 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000.

In 2014, Carlisle led the Mavericks back to the playoffs as the eighth seed with a 49–33 record where they would meet the San Antonio Spurs in the first round. The Mavericks lost in seven games and the Spurs went on to win the 2014 NBA Finals.

In 2015, the Mavericks finished 50–32, but were defeated in five games by the Houston Rockets in the first round.

On January 30, 2015, Carlisle recorded his 600th win in a game against the Miami Heat. On November 1, 2015, Carlisle recorded his 340th win as Mavericks coach, passing Don Nelson as the winningest coach in franchise history. Four days later, Carlisle signed a new five-year deal with Dallas on November 5, 2015.

In 2016, the Mavericks finished sixth in the Western Conference, but were defeated in five games by the Oklahoma City Thunder.

On December 2, 2017, Carlisle recorded his 700th win in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers.

====2018–2021: Luka Dončić era====
During the 2018 NBA draft, the Mavericks traded for Luka Dončić and drafted a second round standout Jalen Brunson. In 2019, the team acquired Tim Hardaway Jr. and Kristaps Porziņģis. In 2020, the Mavericks made the playoffs for the first time in three years as the 7th seed in the conference, losing in six games to the Los Angeles Clippers.

On January 13, 2021, Carlisle recorded his 800th win in a game against the Charlotte Hornets.

In 2021, the Mavericks made the playoffs for the second consecutive year, again set to play the Los Angeles Clippers. This year, the Mavericks entered as the 5th seed in the Western Conference and as Division Champions but lost in seven games to the Clippers.

On June 17, 2021, Carlisle stepped down as the Mavericks&#x27; head coach with two years remaining on his contract.

===Return to Indiana (2021–present)===
On June 24, 2021, Carlisle was hired as the head coach of the Indiana Pacers, returning to the franchise for a second stint. His contract was a reported $29 million over four years.
Upon Carlisle&#x27;s arrival in Indiana, the team began a rebuilding process, departing from core players Domantas Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, Caris LeVert, T.J. Warren, Jeremy Lamb, Justin Holiday, and Torrey Craig. During this period, the Pacers received young rising superstar Tyrese Haliburton, who Carlisle referred to as &quot;an elite young point guard that affects the game positively in many, many ways.&quot; The Pacers also acquired Obi Toppin, Jalen Smith, Aaron Nesmith and Jordan Nwora all from the 2020 NBA draft. In addition, the team acquired multiple first–round draft picks, sharpshooter Buddy Hield, Daniel Theis, and Tristan Thompson. With their numerous draft picks, the team selected Bennedict Mathurin, Jarace Walker, Andrew Nembhard, Chris Duarte, Isaiah Jackson, and Ben Sheppard. The Pacers missed the 2022 and 2023 NBA playoffs with a combined 60–104 record.

On October 26, 2023, Carlisle agreed to a multiyear contract extension with Indiana, extending beyond the 2024–25 season.

On November 6, 2023, Carlisle recorded his 900th win in a 41-point blowout win over the San Antonio Spurs.

In 2024, after a two-year rebuild and acquiring Pascal Siakam, Carlisle&#x27;s Pacers finished with a 47–35 record as the 6th seed, qualifying for the 2024 NBA Playoffs and reaching the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were swept by the eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics.

On May 10, 2024, Carlisle was fined $35,000 for public criticism of the officiating and questioning the integrity of the league and its officials.

==Personal life==
Carlisle married pediatrician Dr. Donna Nobile in 2000. They have a daughter, Abby, born c. 2005. Carlisle is an avid pianist and private pilot, who as of September 2015 had logged nearly 200 hours flying his Cirrus SR22T single-engine light aircraft.

A large cane toad statue, called Buffy, is situated in the town centre on the Bruce Highway () in honour of Sarina&#x27;s cane farming history. Buffy was made from fibreglass in the early 1980s for a parade float for the Apex Sugar Festival. The name Buffy comes from the species name bufo marinus. Buffy has been painted for the &quot;state of origin&quot; football game multiple times and has even been stolen. To try and deter further theft, buffy has been chained to the concrete slab on broad street where he resides, though this hasn&#x27;t stopped people from decorating Buffy with &quot;Queenslander&quot; flags and state of origin banners.

<text>St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe is a Church of England church located on Queen Victoria Street, London in the City of London, near Blackfriars station. It is also the London headquarters for the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London, Archbishop Anba Angaelos, as part of a church-sharing arrangement. 

==History==
First mentioned around 1170, St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe was almost certainly founded considerably earlier. During the 13th century the church was a part of Baynard&#x27;s Castle, an ancient royal residence. In 1361, Edward III moved his Royal Wardrobe (a storehouse for Royal &quot;accoutrements&quot;, housing arms and clothing among other personal items of the Crown) from the Tower of London to just north of the church. It was from this association that the church acquired its unique name.

The Wardrobe and the church, however, were both lost in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Of the 51 churches designed by Sir Christopher Wren after the Great Fire, St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe is among the simplest of his designs; it was erected in 1695.

The church was again gutted during the London blitz by German bombing; only the tower and walls survived. It was rebuilt and rededicated in 1961.

===Present day===
As the parish of St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe rejects the ordination of women, it receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Fulham (currently Jonathan Baker).

==Advowson==
The advowson of St Andrew&#x27;s was anciently held by the family of FitzWalter to which it probably came from the holding by Robert Fitzwalter (d.1235) of the office of Constable of Baynard&#x27;s Castle. In 1417 it was held by Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley (d.1417), as his charter dated 24 June 1417 appointing feoffees to his estate records. Berkeley&#x27;s Inn, the town house of that family stood nearby, at the south end of Adle Street, against Puddle Wharf, as reported by John Stow in his &quot;Survey of London&quot; (1598)

==Building==

St Andrew&#x27;s is situated on a terrace overlooking the street, its plain red-brick exterior contrasting with the stone buildings on either side. The interior is aisled, with arcaded bays supported by piers rather than the usual columns. The original interior fittings were mostly destroyed during the war, and many of the church&#x27;s features were procured from other destroyed Wren churches. The weathervane on the steeple comes from St Michael Bassishaw (which was demolished in 1900). A replacement pulpit came from the church of St Matthew, Friday Street. The font and cover also came from here. The royal arms, of the House of Stuart, came from St Olave Old Jewry (demolished, except for its tower, in 1887). There is a figure of St Andrew, dated around 1600, which stands on the north side of the sanctuary and an unusual figure of Saint Anne who is shown holding the Virgin Mary who in turn holds the Christ child. This statue, which is probably north Italian, dates to around 1500.

William Shakespeare was a member of this parish for about fifteen years while he was working at the Blackfriars Theatre nearby, and later he bought a house within the parish, in Ireland Yard. In his honour, a memorial was erected in the church.

Regular Sunday services are conducted there by the St Gregorios congregation of the Indian Orthodox Church.

The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

==Notable clergy==
* Guy Treweek (husband of Rachel Treweek, the first female diocesan bishop in the Church of England), was priest-in-charge from 2011 to 2015
* Luke Miller; rector since 2016, priest-in-charge from 2015 to 2016

<doc id="643303" wikidata="Q7592425" url="?curid=643303" title="St Andrew Undershaft">
<text>St Andrew Undershaft is a Church of England church in the City of London, the historic nucleus and modern financial centre of London. It is located on St Mary Axe, within the Aldgate ward, and is a rare example of a City church that survived both the Great Fire of London and the Blitz.

The present building was constructed in 1532 but a church has existed on the site since the 12th century. Today, St Andrew Undershaft is administered from the nearby St Helen&#x27;s Bishopsgate church.

==History==

The first church on the site, which today is bordered by St Mary Axe and Leadenhall Street, was built in medieval times, being recorded in 1147. It was rebuilt in the 14th century and again in 1532; this third incarnation of the building survives today. It is in the Perpendicular style with its entrance located at the base of its off-centre tower. The interior is divided into six bays, with many of the original fittings that survived the Victorian renovation. Formerly, St Andrew Undershaft had one of London&#x27;s few surviving large stained-glass windows, installed in the 17th century, but this was destroyed in the Baltic Exchange bombing in 1992.

The church&#x27;s curious name derives from the shaft of the maypole that was traditionally set up each year opposite the church. The custom continued each spring until 1517, when student riots put an end to it, but the maypole itself survived until 1547 when it was seized by a mob and destroyed as a &quot;pagan idol&quot;. According to John Stow, the chronicler who is buried here, they had it &quot;raised from the hooks whereon it had rested for two-and-thirty years, sawn in pieces and burnt.&quot;

St Andrew Undershaft is now administered from the nearby church of St Helen&#x27;s Bishopsgate. St Andrew Undershaft was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

The tower holds a peal of six bells in the key of G, with the tenor being cast in 1597 by Robert Mot. These are now hung dead (they can only be rung stationary) inside the tower.

==Organ==

The organ was installed in 1696 by Renatus Harris. A swell was added in 1750 by John Byfield. There have been other restorations and enhancements by George Pike England in 1810–11 and 1826. Further work was carried out by William Hill, Speechly and J. W. Walker &amp; Sons, and Rushworth and Dreaper. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register

The organ is of such historic significance that it has been awarded a Grade I historic organ certificate by the British Institute of Organ Studies.

==Notable people associated with the church==
* Sir Thomas Offley, Lord Mayor of London 1563–64, was buried in 1582. The monument to Sir Thomas and his wife Joan (died 1578) survives in St Andrew Undershaft. Joan was a granddaughter of Sir Stephen Jennings, Lord Mayor, who funded the rebuilding of the church.
* John Stow, author of the &quot;Survey of London&quot;: buried in 1605. The quill pen held in the hand of his alabaster monument is renewed periodically by, alternately, the Lord Mayor of London and the Master of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, at a memorial service organised by the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society.
* Hugh Hamersley, Lord Mayor of London in 1627, whose memorial is in St Andrew Undershaft.

<text>Ivan &quot;Chip&quot; Frederick II (born 1966) is an American former soldier who was court-martialed for prisoner abuse after the 2003–2004 Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal. Along with other soldiers of his Army Reserve unit, the 372nd Military Police Company, Frederick was accused of allowing and inflicting sexual, physical, and psychological abuse on Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib prison, a notorious prison in Baghdad during the United States&#x27; occupation of Iraq. In May 2004, Frederick pleaded guilty to conspiracy, dereliction of duty, maltreatment of detainees, assault, and indecent acts. He was sentenced to 8 years&#x27; confinement and loss of rank and pay, and he received a dishonorable discharge. He was released on parole in October 2007, after spending four years in prison.

Frederick was a staff sergeant and the senior enlisted soldier at the prison from October to December 2003. Prior to his deployment to Iraq, Frederick was a corrections officer at Buckingham Correctional Center in Dillwyn, Virginia.

<text>Cyclorrhapha is an unranked taxon within the infraorder Muscomorpha. They are called &quot;Cyclorrhapha&quot; (&#x27;circular-seamed flies&#x27;) with reference to the circular aperture through which the adult escapes the puparium. This is a circumscriptional name that has significant historical familiarity, but in the present classification, this name is synonymous with the more recent &quot;Muscomorpha&quot;.

Cyclorrhapha underwent major adaptive radiation that led to the creation of over 72 000 species. These species share multiple attributes such as the 360-degree rotation of the male terminalia.

Cyclorrhapha exhibits significant morphological and molecular diversity, including notable changes in anterior egg development, as exemplified by the role of the exuperantia (exu) gene in Anastrepha fraterculus, a species of great agricultural importance. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses suggest that the larval structures of Cyclorrhapha have evolved in response to varying food consistencies, reflecting their ecological adaptations.

<text>Bristol Community College (Bristol) is a public community college with four campuses in Southeastern Massachusetts.

==History==
The college was originally established in December 1965 when it was instituted by the Massachusetts Board of Regional Community Colleges.

==Campuses==
The Fall River campus is located on of land at 777 Elsbree Street. There are three additional campuses in New Bedford located at 800 Purchase Street, Attleboro located at 11 Field Road (which is shared with Bridgewater State University) and Taunton located at 2 Hamilton St.

Prior to 2014, Bristol held Taunton operations through day and night classes at Cohannet School and Benjamin A. Friedman Middle School, respectively. In 2014 it occupied the former Taunton Catholic Middle School in Taunton, which now houses a satellite campus of its own. In 2021, it moved to the centrally-located former Coyle &amp; Cassidy Memorial High School. Prior to 2019, Bristol was located in the now demolished Silver City Galleria.

==Academics==
Bristol Community College offers associate degrees and certificates in over 150 academic programs, ranging from Associate of Science degrees, Associate of Arts degrees, Associate of Applied Science degrees, and a wide range of certificates. Bristol Community College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

==Student life==
At the end of the 2010–11 year, Bristol Community College had an undergraduate population of 12,123 day and evening credit students, along with an additional 17,439 in noncredit enrollments. The average annual tuition and fees for in-state students was around $4,166, whereas the out-of-state students paid, on average, about $9,482 in total annual tuition and fees. The average cost for a 3 credit course is approximately $498, equivalent to about $166 per credit.

==Athletics==
The Bristol&#x27;s athletic program was re-established in 2008. Under the guidance of Brian Fernandes as the athletic director, the college now competes in the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) in five varsity sports: men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer in the fall, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball in the winter, and men&#x27;s golf in the spring. The current mascot is the &quot;Bristol Bayhawk.&quot;

<doc id="643324" wikidata="Q19835" url="?curid=643324" title="Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden">
<text>Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden is an studio complex in Leavesden in Watford, Hertfordshire, in the East of England. Formerly known as Leavesden Film Studios and still colloquially known as Leavesden Studios or simply Leavesden, it is a film and media complex owned by Warner Bros. The studios were all converted from an aircraft factory and airfield called Leavesden Aerodrome, a centre of British aircraft production during World War II. The nearest railway station is King&#x27;s Langley which is a walking distance of .

The studios contain approximately of flexible space which includes stage space, one of the largest filtered and heated stage-based water tanks in Europe, production office space, workshops and support buildings, along with an extensive backlot which offers a 180-degree uninterrupted horizon, favourable for exterior sets. Following a £110 million refurbishment by Warner Bros., the studios are now one of the largest and most state-of-the-art filmmaking facilities in the world.

Though the studios are owned by Warner Bros., all of the studio facilities are available to rent for any production. Since acquiring the site, Warner Bros. has opened a public attraction named Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, which receives over 6,000 visitors a day at peak times. The site maintains a secure studio space within the same complex.

==History==
===Leavesden Aerodrome===

Leavesden Aerodrome was an airfield created in 1940 by the de Havilland Aircraft Company and the Air Ministry in the village of Leavesden, between Watford and Abbots Langley, in Hertfordshire.

Construction began in 1940 after the outbreak of World War II. The de Havilland company, who were based in nearby Hatfield, entered into a contract with the Air Ministry to produce what would become known as the Mosquito fast bomber aircraft. Space for the large scale hangars needed to produce the huge number of aeroplanes required was not available at de Havilland&#x27;s Hatfield Aerodrome, so the Ministry of Supply requisitioned this new site in Leavesden, which was an empty plot of land at the time from the Watford Corporation, and it was developed into the complex that it is today. The construction was enormously expensive so parts of the site were leased to the London Aircraft Production Group and The Second Aircraft Group. Under Handley Page, another Hertfordshire-based aeroplane manufacturer contracted to the Air Ministry, these groups produced the Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber. As a result, by the end of the war Leavesden Airfield was, by volume, the largest factory in the world.

The two planes were both critical successes for Britain during the conflict. Due to the high priority placed on aircraft production, large numbers of workers were drafted with little experience or training in aircraft production, with over half the workforce eventually being female. As part of constructing the aircraft factory an airstrip was created, first so the planes could be tested and later to deliver the craft to their final destinations. The runway and control tower still remain to this day, even after two major renovations, in an effort to preserve the site&#x27;s history. The runway is now the main road through the complex and the tower is currently an observation lounge.

After the war, the aerodrome was purchased outright by de Havilland, who themselves had a succession of owners in the following decades, including Hawker Siddeley from 1959, but ultimately they and the site were acquired by Rolls-Royce who continued production and design of helicopter engines. Under Rolls-Royce ownership the RTM322 engine for the UK Apache, Merlin and NH90 helicopters was designed, developed and produced at Leavesden as a joint venture with Turbomeca of France. The airfield was also used by commercial small business aircraft as the field is close to both the M1 and M25 motorways. However, by the early 1990s, Britain&#x27;s manufacturing industry was in decline and Rolls-Royce had sold their interests in the site and transferred all work to their Bristol facility. Unable to find a new owner, by 1994 Leavesden Aerodrome was left disused and all but abandoned.

The following units were here at some point:
* No. 122 Gliding School RAF
* Coastal Command Communication Squadron RAF

===Leavesden Studios===
In 1994, Eon Productions&#x27; &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;GoldenEye&quot; was to be the next film in the series. Pinewood Studios, their traditional home studio, was fully booked with other productions, not being prepared for the series&#x27; unexpected return (production had been delayed for several years thanks to legal issues between MGM and Eon Productions). Facing little time to find a space in which they could build the number of large scale sets required, the production discovered the unoccupied Leavesden. The wide, tall and open aircraft hangars were uniquely well suited to conversion into film stages. Eon leased the site for the duration of their shoot and went about gutting the factories, turning them into the stages, workshops and offices needed for a working film studio. This process is shown on the 2006 DVD&#x27;s special features. Members of the production crew, impressed by the enormous size of the filmmaking complex they suddenly had to themselves, jokingly called Leavesden &quot;Cubbywood&quot; after Eon&#x27;s long serving producer Albert R. &#x27;Cubby&#x27; Broccoli.

Leavesden Studios, as the site was rebranded by its owners, quickly became popular after filming of &quot;GoldenEye&quot; was completed. A succession of major feature films made use of the site; in 1997, the first of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, and later Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;.

By the year 2000, Heyday Films had acquired use of the site on behalf of Warner Bros. for what would be the first in a series of films, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. Every one of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films was based at Leavesden Studios over the following ten years.

While other productions—almost exclusively other Warner Bros. productions—made partial use of the studios, the site was mostly occupied by &quot;Harry Potter&quot;″s permanent standing sets. Indeed, some films, such as &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; and &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; actually made use of some of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; sets since they were sufficiently appropriate for their Victorian setting and tone. During this time, however, it was noted that there were some ways in which the site&#x27;s facilities might be improved. None of the stages were adequately soundproofed and the WW2 era ceilings had a tendency to leak during rainy weather.

One of the more noticeable exterior sets constructed on the Leavesden backlot (outdoors) was a row of ten houses (five per side) along a street, which was created for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series to represent Privet Drive.

On 21 March 2010, there was a fire on one of the Hogwarts sets during filming of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; at Leavesden Studios. Not much of the set was badly damaged.

In 2010, as the final &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film was nearing completion, Warner Bros. announced their intention to purchase the studio as a permanent European base, the first studio to do so since Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the 1940s.

=== Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden ===
By November 2010, Warner Bros. completed its purchase of Leavesden Studios and announced plans to invest more than £100 million into the site they had occupied for over ten years, rebranding it Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden. The studios make Warner Bros. the only Hollywood film studio with a permanent base in the United Kingdom.

Much of the redevelopment involved converting stages A to H into sound stages and equipping all the facilities with the latest fittings a production might require. The refurbished stages were conversions of the original buildings and the runway and control tower from the site&#x27;s days as an aerodrome remain intact as well as all of the buildings&#x27; original structures. The full scale refurbishment and renovation of the production facilities were completed and the studios reopened to film and television work in 2012.

As part of this redevelopment Warner Bros. also created two entirely new soundstages, J &amp; K, to house a permanent public exhibition named the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, creating 300 new jobs in the local area. Currently the whole attraction is dedicated to the making of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and is now home to many of the series&#x27; sets, props and costumes. It was opened to the public in early 2012.

The first film to start shooting at the newly refurbished studios was &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot;. Though the studios are privately owned, the shooting spaces are available to rent for any production.

On 30 June 2014, Warner Bros. announced the expansion of the studio, building three new state-of-the-art stages and adding a further of office space. The announcements were made after a reception celebrating the Creative Industries, hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron, and attended by WB&#x27;s CEO Kevin Tsujihara and WB UK&#x27;s MD Josh Berger. Leavesden&#x27;s trio of new sound-stages consist of one building and two buildings, along with of adjacent office space which were completed by the end of 2014. On the same day the filming of live-action &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot; got underway at the studio. Following the refurbishments, the studios are now one of the largest and most state-of-the-art secure filmmaking facilities in the world.

===Royal opening===
Almost twenty years after the complex was converted from aerodrome to film studios—and over a year since the completion of work on the newly refurbished studios—the site was officially opened by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on 26 April 2013. On their visit, they were accompanied by the Duke&#x27;s brother Prince Harry and J. K. Rowling (who had been unable to attend the tour&#x27;s grand opening the year before), amongst other guests. Several hundred beneficiaries of supported charities were given invitations to the Studio Tour on the day of the visit. The royal entourage visited both the tour and the studios, viewing the props and costumes from Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; films, before conducting the site&#x27;s inauguration.

===2019 fire===
On 10 July 2019, a fire broke out in one of the studio&#x27;s sets, and would take responders 15 hours to extinguish. A set for the HBO television series &quot;Avenue 5&quot; was damaged in the fire.

Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is a public attraction in Leavesden Hertfordshire, England. It is a permanent behind-the-scenes exhibition of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.

The Studio Tour, opened to the public in early 2012. The grand opening event was attended by many of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series cast and crew members.

Each tour session typically lasting three and a half hours, the studio tour has the capacity to handle up to 8,000 visitors daily. Despite Warner Bros. being the studio behind &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, the tour is not styled as a theme park, due to the fact that Warner Bros. sold the licence to do so to Universal Studios.

Though the standard tour is self-guided, various guided tours are available at an additional cost.

===Creation===
As early as 2001, on the heels of the success of the first film, Warner Bros. planned to build an attraction dedicated to the series in place and so began storing items from the films when they were no longer being used.

The tour&#x27;s layout and overall presentation was designed by the Los Angeles-based Thinkwell Group in close collaboration with Warner Bros. and the actual filmmakers, including Production Designer Stuart Craig, Set Dresser Stephenie McMillan, Creature Designer Nick Dudman and Special Effects Supervisor John Richardson. It only includes sets, props and costumes that were actually created for or used in the production of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. Sets like the Great Hall, Dumbledore&#x27;s Office, Diagon Alley, the Ministry of Magic, Gryffindor Common Room and Boys&#x27; Dormitory, Hagrid&#x27;s Hut and a 1:24 scale model of Hogwarts Castle.
===Reception===
Since opening in 2012, TripAdvisor has reported &quot;The Making of Harry Potter&quot; as the highest-rated attraction in the world every year since.

===Expansions===
Warner Bros. has continued to put on special features following a seasonal rotation, such as Dark Arts, Magical mischief and Hogwarts in the snow. Some installations like the Wand Choreography Interactive and the inside of the last No. 4 Privet Drive Exterior set have been so popular that they have remained after their respective features have closed.

In January 2015, the attraction&#x27;s first expansion was announced – a new &quot;Platform 9¾&quot; section, where visitors are able to board the original carriages behind the Hogwarts Express steam engine used in the films. The setup includes the locomotive GWR 4900 Class 5972 &quot;Olton Hall&quot; (dressed as 5972 &quot;Hogwarts Express&quot;) and the British Rail Mark 1 train that appeared in the films, brought to life by John Richardson&#x27;s special effects team. Finally a new green screen experience illustrates what working on the films is like from an actor&#x27;s point of view. This section opened in late March 2015.

The tour in Warner Bros. Studios Burbank has been renamed Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood (previously it was known as the Warner Bros. Studios VIP Tour). Warner has altered the tour, offering more facilities and options to visitors.
The latest expansion opening in Summer 2023 is the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo

<doc id="643326" wikidata="Q6254620" url="?curid=643326" title="John Rennie the Younger">
<text>Sir John Rennie FRSA (30 August 1794 – 3 September 1874) was the second son of engineer John Rennie the Elder, and brother of George Rennie.

== Early life ==

John Rennie was born at 27 Stamford Street, Blackfriars Road, London, on 30 August 1794. He was educated by Dr. Greenlaw at Isleworth, and afterwards by Dr. Charles Burney at Greenwich. He subsequently entered his father&#x27;s manufactory in Holland Street, Blackfriars Road, where he acquired a practical knowledge of his profession, and in 1813 he was placed under Mr. Hollingsworth, resident engineer of Waterloo Bridge, the foundations of which he personally superintended. In 1815 he assisted his father in the erection of Southwark Bridge, and in 1819 he went abroad for the purpose of studying the great engineering works on the continent.

== J. &amp; G. Rennie ==

On the death of his father in 1821, John remained in partnership with his brother George, the civil engineering portion of the business being carried on by him, whereas the mechanical engineering was supervised by George.

== Royal William Victualling Yard ==
Rennie along with Philip Richards designed Royal William Victualling Yard, Plymouth, (1823–33). Covering , this grand classical style ensemble built from Plymouth limestone and Dartmoor granite, consists of a grand gateway surmounted by a statue of King William IV. There is the Slaughterhouse, then around a central dock basin, to the south, Melville Square - a warehouse with a central courtyard - it has a clock tower over the main entrance; to the west of the basin is the Bakery with its mill and to the east the Brewery, with its cooperage.

==Cannon Workshops==
Rennie also was responsible for designing Cannon Workshops, which arose following the strike by the coopers employed by the West India Dock Company. The company decided to reorganise the cooperage department, and Rennie drew up the plans, submitting them in 1824. The buildings were completed in 1825.

== Bridges and marine engineering ==

The most important of John Rennie&#x27;s undertakings, from 1824, was the construction of London Bridge, the designs for which had been prepared by his father. The bridge was opened in 1831, when Rennie was knighted, being the first of the profession since Sir Hugh Myddleton to be thus distinguished. He was responsible for the New River Ancholme Drainage Scheme in Lincolnshire, and Horkstow Bridge, which he designed to cross the river at Horkstow in 1835–6, is one of the earliest suspension bridges to survive and remains substantially as designed. As engineer to the Admiralty, a post in which he succeeded his father, he completed various works at Sheerness, Woolwich, Plymouth, Ramsgate, and the great breakwater at Plymouth, of which he published an &#x27;Account&#x27; in 1848. Many years of his life were spent in making additions and alterations to various harbours on different parts of the coast, both in England and in Ireland. One example would be his work in the 1850s designing a drydock for Joseph Wheeler at his Rushbrooke yard in Cork. He completed the drainage works in the Lincolnshire fens commenced by his father, and, in conjunction with Telford, constructed the Nene outfall near Wisbech (1826–1831). He also restored the harbour of Boston in 1827–8, and made various improvements on the Welland. He also re-modernised the Chatham Dockyards in 1862. Creating 3 huge basins and passageways.

== Railway engineering ==

Although Rennie and his brother were early in the field as a railway engineers – having been involved, with George Stephenson, in the design of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway – their practice in this department was not very large. The company did however supply a number of locomotives for the London and Croydon Railway in 1838 and 1839. In 1852 John laid out a system of railways for Sweden, for which he received the order of Gustavus Vasa, and in 1855 he designed a series of railways and harbours for Portugal, none of which were, however, carried out.

== Institution of Civil Engineers ==

Rennie was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 25 June 1844, and he became president on 21 January 1845, retaining the office for three years. His presidential address in 1846 was a complete history of the profession of civil engineering. He also contributed papers on the drainage of the level of Ancholme, Lincolnshire, and on the improvement of the navigation of the Newry. He published, besides his &quot;Account of Plymouth Breakwater&quot;, (1848), the &quot;Theory, Formation, and Construction of British and Foreign Harbours&quot; (1851–54). He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

== Retirement and death ==

Rennie retired from the active duties of his profession about 1862, and died at Bengeo, near Hertford, on 3 September 1874, just after his 80th birthday.

He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London on the edge of a southern spur path. The grave has a new plaque to compensate for the original worn slab.

Gardiner&#x27;s Island is a small island in the Town of East Hampton, New York, in Eastern Suffolk County. It is located in Gardiner&#x27;s Bay between the two peninsulas at the east end of Long Island. It is long, wide and has of coastline.

The island has been owned by the Gardiner family and their descendants since 1639 when Lion Gardiner purchased it from the Montaukett chief Wyandanch. At , it is one of the largest privately owned islands in the United States, though slightly smaller than Naushon Island in Massachusetts, owned by the Forbes family.

==Geography==
The island is in size. Its 3,318 acres include more than of old growth forest and another of meadows. Many of the buildings date back to the 17th century. In 1989, the island was said to be worth $125 million.

The island has the largest stand of white oak in the American Northeast. Other trees include swamp maple, wild cherry and birch. The island is home to New York state&#x27;s largest colony of ospreys and is one of the few locations in the world where they build their nests on the ground, as the birds have no natural predators on the island.

==Structures==
In addition to the family mansion and the Gardiners Island Windmill, structures on the island include a private airstrip on the south side and a carpenter&#x27;s shed said to have been built in 1639.

The shed&#x27;s claim to being the oldest surviving wood-frame structure in New York state is disputed by some. No primary sources authenticating its construction have been produced, only a description by Robert David Lion Gardiner in a 1976 documentary about the island. An earlier source that describes the settlement and early life on the island makes no mention of the shed.

==History==
===First English settlement in New York===
The island was settled by Lion Gardiner in 1639, who moved there with his family from the Connecticut Colony. He reportedly purchased the island from the local Montaukett people for &quot;a large black dog, some powder and shot, and a few Dutch blankets.&quot; The Indians called the island &quot;Manchonake&quot;, while Gardiner initially called it &quot;Isle of Wight&quot;, because it reminded him of the Isle of Wight in England. The Montauketts gave Gardiner the title, at least in part because of his support for them in the Pequot War.

The island was not part of the Connecticut Colony or the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations of the British, nor was it a part of the Dutch colony of New Netherlands. It evidently fell under the jurisdiction of Earl of Stirling, William Alexander, who had been given Long Island by the King of England in 1636 and required Gardiner to gain his approval of the land grant through his agent James Farrett. It has been privately owned by Gardiner&#x27;s descendants for years.

The royal patent of 1639 gave Gardiner the &quot;right to possess the land forever&quot;, with the island being declared a proprietary colony Gardiner was given the title of Lord of the Manor and the attenuating privileges of governorship.

On October 5, 1665, after the British had taken over New Netherlands and established the Province of New York, and it had been established that Long Island would not be part of the Connecticut Colony, Richard Nicolls, the first Governor of the Province, issued a new patent to Lion Gardiner&#x27;s son David.
In 1688, when Governor Thomas Dongan granted a patent formally establishing the East Hampton municipal government, there was an attempt to annex the island, which the Gardiners successfully resisted. Gardiner&#x27;s Island would remain independent of outside municipal jurisdiction until after the American Revolution, when it was formally annexed to East Hampton.

Gardiner established a plantation on the island, raising corn, wheat, fruit, tobacco, and livestock.

===Captain Kidd===
Privateer William Kidd stopped at the island in June 1699 while sailing to Boston to answer charges of piracy. With the permission of the island&#x27;s proprietor, he buried a chest, a box of gold, and two boxes of silver in a ravine between Bostwick&#x27;s Point and the Manor House. Indicating to Mrs. Gardiner that the box of gold was intended for the Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Lord Bellomont, Kidd gave Mrs. Gardiner a length of gold cloth, captured from a Moorish ship off the coast of India, and a sack of sugar in thanks for her hospitality.

A legend developed that Kidd warned that if the treasure was not there when he returned he would kill the Gardiners, though trial testimony given by John Gardiner on July 17, 1699, makes no mention of any threats, and Kidd&#x27;s conduct appears to have been quite civil. Kidd was tried in Boston, and Gardiner was ordered by Governor Bellomont to deliver the treasure as evidence. The booty included gold dust, bars of silver, Spanish dollars, rubies, diamonds, candlesticks, and porringers. Gardiner kept one of the diamonds which he later gave to his daughter. A plaque on the island marks the spot where the treasure was buried.

===American Revolution===
The Gardiners sided with the colonists during the American Revolution. A fleet of thirteen British ships sailed into the island&#x27;s Cherry Harbor and began foraging and pillaging its manor house at will; they were planning to turn it into a private hunting preserve. Among the British interlopers were Henry Clinton and John André. At one point, Major André and Gardiner&#x27;s son Nathaniel Gardiner exchanged toasts on the island. Nathaniel Gardiner was a surgeon for the New Hampshire Continental Infantry. He was the American surgeon who later attended to André before he was executed for spying with Benedict Arnold.

Following the revolution, the island was formally brought under East Hampton town jurisdiction.

===War of 1812===
During the War of 1812, a British fleet of seven ships of the line and several smaller frigates anchored in Cherry Harbor and conducted raids on American shipping through Long Island Sound. Crews would come ashore for provisions, which were purchased at market prices. During one of the British excursions, Americans captured some of the crew. The British came to arrest then owner John Lyon Gardiner, who, being a delicate man, adopted the &quot;green room defense&quot;, where he stayed in a bed with green curtains surrounded by medicine to make him look feeble. The British, not wanting a sick man on board, let him be.

The British were to bury several personnel on the island during the course of the war. Some of the British fleet that burned Washington assembled in the harbor in 1814.

Gardiner&#x27;s supply boats were manned by slaves during the war, and this made it easier for them to pass through British lines. After the State of New York abolished slavery in 1827, many of the freed Gardiner slaves went to live in Freetown, just north of East Hampton village.

===Remainder of 19th century===
Julia Gardiner, who was to become President John Tyler&#x27;s second wife and First Lady in 1844, was born on the island in 1820.

Gardiners Point Island is an tiny islet in Block Island Sound that is the former location of both the Gardiners Island Lighthouse and Fort Tyler. Once a peninsula of Gardiner&#x27;s Island, it is the location of a parcel the federal government purchased from the Gardiners in 1851 for $400. Work on the lighthouse began in 1854, with the lighthouse being first lit in 1855 following a $7,000 construction expenditure. It was a square 1½ story brick building with a sixth order Fresnel Lens producing a fixed white light located above sea level.

A March 1888 nor&#x27;easter caused a break in the peninsula, permanently turning the point into an island (but leaving it under the jurisdiction of East Hampton). Between 1890 and 1893 the island was shrinking at the rate of per year. On March 7, 1894, the lighthouse was abandoned and shortly afterward fell into the ocean. A lighted buoy was then moored ¼ miles northeast of the lighthouse.

During the Spanish–American War, the War Department appropriated $500,000 to build the Fort Tyler battery on the island. One source states it was named in General Order 194 of 27 December 1904 for Daniel Tyler, a general and Civil War veteran who died in 1882. Another claim is that it was named for former President John Tyler (1841–1845), who married Julia Gardiner Tyler, born on Gardiners Island. 

The fort was intended to consist of Battery Edmund Smith, with emplacements for two 8-inch M1888 disappearing guns and two 5-inch M1900 guns on pedestal mounts. Records indicate that it was never armed. The shifting sands caused problems for the fort and it was abandoned in the late 1920s.

===20th century===
In 1938, Gardiners Point Island was declared a National Wildlife Refuge by Franklin D. Roosevelt and transferred to the Agriculture Department. During World War II, the former Fort Tyler was used for target practice and was reduced to its present state of ruin. The state of New York briefly considered turning it into a park, but it is deemed a navigational hazard because of the possibilities of unexploded ordnance. It is privately owned now.

A manor house built by David Gardiner in 1774 burned to the ground in 1947, it is thought after a guest fell asleep while smoking. Valuable antiques were destroyed, with the caretaker escaping by jumping from a window. Owing to the high cost of upkeep, the island was put up for sale in 1937. It was bought by a multimillionaire relative, Sarah Diodati Gardiner, for $400,000. She erected a new 28-room manor house in the Georgian style. She died in 1953, unmarried, at age 90. Upon her death in 1953, the island passed in trust to her nephew Robert David Lion Gardiner and niece Alexandra Gardiner Creel (brother and sister). 

From 1955 until 1963, Sperry Rand leased the island for top echelon meetings. 

Robert David Lion Gardiner and Alexandra Gardiner Creel occupied the island at the expiration of Sperry Rand&#x27;s lease in 1963. Gardiner inherited three Gardiner fortunes: from his father, his uncle and his Aunt Sarah.

The island was designated as a National Natural Landmark (NNL) in April 1967 by the National Park Service, in recognition of its waterfowl and shorebird habitat, and its role as a breeding ground for osprey.

====Bickering ownership====
Sarah Diodati Gardiner had also set aside a trust fund for upkeep of the island, but it was exhausted by the 1970s. When Alexandra Gardiner Creel died, her rights passed to her daughter, Alexandra Creel Goelet. Robert David Lion Gardiner and Goelet were to have a highly publicized dispute over ownership and direction of the island.

Robert accused Alexandra of wanting to sell and develop the island. She accused him of not paying his share of the estimated $2 million per year upkeep and taxes of the island. Robert said he would not oppose ownership by the government or a private conservancy group. The case went to court in 1980 and Robert was initially barred from visiting the island, but in 1992, courts ruled that he could visit the island (although the Goelets and Gardiner were not on the island at the same time).

Robert Gardiner, who claimed the notional title &quot;16th Lord of the Manor of Gardiner&#x27;s Island&quot; and lived in East Hampton, married in 1961 but had no children, leaving him with no direct heir. In 1989, Gardiner attempted unsuccessfully to adopt a middle-aged Mississippi businessman, George Gardiner Green Jr., as his son. Green was a descendant of Lion Gardiner. Upon Robert&#x27;s death in 2004, total ownership passed to Goelet. Shortly before his death he said:

===21st century===
In 2005, the Goelets offered to place a conservation easement on the island in exchange for a promise from the Town of East Hampton not to rezone the land, change its assessment or attempt to acquire it by condemnation. The Goelets and East Hampton agreed upon the easement through 2025.

Gardiners Island&#x27;s NNL status was removed in July 2006, following a request from the island&#x27;s owner, Alexandra Creel Goelet.

<doc id="643342" wikidata="Q1417143" url="?curid=643342" title="Gödel Prize">
<text>The Gödel Prize is an annual prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science, given jointly by the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computational Theory (ACM SIGACT). The award is named in honor of Kurt Gödel. Gödel&#x27;s connection to theoretical computer science is that he was the first to mention the &quot;P versus NP&quot; question, in a 1956 letter to John von Neumann in which Gödel asked whether a certain NP-complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time.

The Gödel Prize has been awarded since 1993. The prize is awarded alternately at ICALP (even years) and STOC (odd years). STOC is the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, one of the main North American conferences in theoretical computer science, whereas ICALP is the International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming, one of the main European conferences in the field. To be eligible for the prize, a paper must be published in a refereed journal within the last 14 (formerly 7) years. The prize includes a reward of US$5000.

The winner of the Prize is selected by a committee of six members. The EATCS President and the SIGACT Chair each appoint three members to the committee, to serve staggered three-year terms. The committee is chaired alternately by representatives of EATCS and SIGACT.

In contrast with the Gödel Prize, which recognizes outstanding papers, the Knuth Prize is awarded to individuals for their overall impact in the field.

<doc id="643343" wikidata="Q18153103" url="?curid=643343" title="Password (American game show)">
<text>Password is an American television game show. Two teams, each composed of a celebrity and contestant, attempt to convey mystery words to each other using only single-word clues, in order to win cash prizes. Various incarnations of the show have aired on television since the 1960s.

The show was created by Bob Stewart and originally produced by Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions. It aired on CBS from 1961 to 1967, and ABC from 1971 to 1975. The original host was Allen Ludden, who had previously been well known as the host of the &quot;G.E. College Bowl&quot;. Two revivals later aired on NBC: &quot;Password Plus&quot; from 1979 to 1982, and &quot;Super Password&quot; from 1984 to 1989, followed by a primetime version, &quot;Million Dollar Password&quot;, on CBS from 2008 to 2009. All of these versions introduced new variations in gameplay. In 2022, NBC premiered a primetime revival of &quot;Password&quot; executive produced by Jimmy Fallon, and hosted by actress Keke Palmer. This version is a modernization of the original CBS version, and features Fallon as a regular panelist.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it #8 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever.

==Rules==
Two teams, each consisting of one celebrity player and one &quot;civilian&quot; contestant, competed. The word to be conveyed (the &quot;password&quot;) was given to one player on each team and was shown onscreen to viewers as well as spoken softly on the audio track. Gameplay alternated between the two teams. On each team, the player who was given the password gave a one-word clue from which their partner attempted to guess the password. (For example, the &quot;opposite clue&quot; &quot;stop&quot; might be given for the password &quot;go&quot;, or the next &quot;instructional clue&quot; &quot;synonym&quot; might be given to elicit the password &quot;halt&quot;). If the partner failed to guess the password within the allotted five-second time limit, or if an illegal clue was given (two or more words, a hyphenated word, &quot;coined&quot; words, hand gestures, or any part or form of the password), play passed to the opposing team. If the password was revealed by the clue-giver it was thrown out.

The game continued until one of the players guessed the password correctly, any form of the password was given as a clue, or until ten clues had been given. Scoring was based on the number of clues given when the password was guessed, e.g. ten points were awarded for guessing the password on the first clue, nine points on the second clue, eight points on the third clue, etc., down to one point on the tenth and final clue. On the ABC version, a limit of six clues was imposed to expedite gameplay, with the last clue worth five points. In addition, teams were given the option of either playing or passing control of the first clue to the opposing team. Specifically, the team that was trailing in score, or that had lost the previous game, was offered the pass/play option; when the score was tied, the team that failed to get the previous password was awarded the pass/play option.

On the CBS daytime edition, the first team to reach 25 points won that contestant $100. On the nighttime edition, the winner won $250. The winning team earned a chance to win up to an additional $250 by playing the &quot;Lightning Round&quot;, in which the civilian contestant on the prevailing team tried to guess five passwords within 60 seconds from clues given by his/her celebrity partner. The Lightning Round passwords were shown on a small, pop-up display which appeared only in front of the clue-giver (which the camera could also see), and the contestant was allowed to give multiple responses to each clue. The clue-giver was also allowed to skip to the next password, but after all 5 were given, if time allowed, the outstanding ones were redisplayed in sequence. $50 was awarded for each correctly guessed password; this was increased to $100 from 1973 to 1974.

The Lightning Round was among the first bonus rounds on a television game (along with the scrambled phrase game on the original &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;). On the ABC version from 1971 to 1974, immediately after completing the Lightning Round, the player was given a chance at &quot;the Betting Word,&quot; in which they could wager any amount of their winnings on their celebrity partner&#x27;s ability to guess it within 15 seconds. This increased the maximum bonus prize to $500 ($1,000 from 1973 to 1974 when the regular Lightning Round values were doubled).

In each episode from 1961 to 1975, Ludden would caution the players about unacceptable clues by stating, &quot;When you hear this sound (a buzzer would sound) it means your clue has not been accepted by our authority, (name of word authority).&quot; Word authorities on the CBS version included New York University professor David H. Greene and &quot;World Book Encyclopedia Dictionary&quot; editor Dr. Reason A. Goodwin (that dictionary being still a work-in-progress at the time of the show&#x27;s first airing, first appearing in print form in 1963). Robert Stockwell from UCLA and Carolyn Duncan served as word authorities during the ABC version.

Jack Clark, Lee Vines, and John Harlan whispered the password to viewers on the first two versions of the show, but the practice was discontinued, beginning with &quot;Password All-Stars&quot;, when a computer (referred to as &quot;Murphy&quot; by Ludden) was incorporated. The computer would display the password one letter at a time (like a typewriter), followed by the quotation marks. A beeping sound would accompany each letter as it appeared on the screen. A final beep would signal that the password was revealed to the home viewer, and play would start. On &quot;Password Plus&quot;, a bell would ring when the password was revealed. On &quot;Super Password&quot; from September 24, 1984, to October 17, 1986, a chirping sound was heard when the password was revealed. However, Gene Wood began whispering the words on &quot;Super Password&quot; just like in the original, starting on October 20, 1986. The practice was again discontinued on &quot;Million Dollar Password&quot;, while the 2022 revival reinstated it.

Before the cancellation of the Goodson-Todman game show &quot;Snap Judgment&quot; on NBC in 1969, that program&#x27;s set was changed to make it resemble the look of the CBS &quot;Password&quot;. Goodson-Todman did this to correspond to rule changes that made &quot;Snap Judgment&quot; identical to &quot;Password.&quot;

==Contestants==
On the CBS daytime version, contestants played two matches, win or lose, with each game awarding $100 to the winner. For most of the CBS nighttime version&#x27;s first year, the same two players stayed for the entire show, playing as many matches as time allowed with each player guaranteed at least $100. However, after three contestants managed to break the $1,000 mark, this practice was changed in November 1962 to having two new contestants play each game (generally, three pairs of contestants competed in the course of each show), with winning contestants receiving $250 and losers receiving a consolation prize (usually $50).

For two shows in July 1965, the nighttime version experimented with a &quot;championship match&quot; format, in which the winners of games 1 and 2 would return to compete against each other in the final game. Also in 1965, the show adopted an annual &quot;Tournament of Champions&quot; where contestants on the daytime version who won both their games were invited back to compete for more money.

Early on in the ABC version, contestants played a single-elimination game; winning contestants could stay until they were either defeated or won a maximum of 10 games, thus retiring them as undefeated champions. Later on, the limit was dropped, and champions stayed on the show until defeated. From 1973 to 1974, the first contestant to win a two-out-of-three match played the Lightning Round.

Every three months, the four top winners during that period would return for a quarterly contest. The winner would earn $1,000 and the right to compete in the annual Tournament of Champions. The winner of the annual contest won $5,000, received a free trip to Macedonia, and faced the previous year&#x27;s champion in a best-of-seven match for $10,000. Lewis Retrum, from Boston, won the Tournament of Champions two years in a row and retired undefeated when the show went off the air.

==Format changes==
From November 18, 1974, to February 21, 1975, &quot;Password&quot; became &quot;Password All-Stars&quot;, where teams of celebrities played for charity in a tournament-style format. At the end of each week, the highest scorer would win $5,000 and advance to the Grandmasters&#x27; Championship, which would award the winner another $25,000. The first tournament&#x27;s finalists were Dick Gautier, James Shigeta, Peter Bonerz, and Don Galloway, with Shigeta winning the championship; the second tournament&#x27;s finalists were Richard Dawson, Bill Bixby, Hal Linden, and Betty White, with Dawson winning the championship (Dawson had almost made it to the first tournament finals, but Gautier beat him out during their preliminary week by just one point).

After the celebrity format modification proved unpopular with viewers, Goodson-Todman made &quot;Password All-Stars&quot; simply &quot;Password&quot; again, but the show carried over elements of &quot;All-Stars&quot; mainly to use the set that had been redesigned for the all-celebrity period. Among these was an elimination round in which four contestants (two new players and the two players from the previous game) competed with the help of the two celebrities in the first round. In the qualifying round, one of the two celebrities used a one-word clue to a password (with both celebrities alternating turns on giving clues), and the four contestants would ring in with the password. If no contestant identified the password after four clues, the word would be discarded. A correct response earned that contestant one point, with three points needed to qualify for the regular game. An incorrect response locked that player out of the word in play. The first two contestants to reach three points went on to play the regular Password game.

In the regular game, an addition to the rules was the &quot;double&quot; option, in which the first clue giver could ask to increase the word value to 20 points by giving only one clue; if that word was missed, the other team could score the 20 points with a second clue. The first team to reach 50 points or more could win thousands of dollars in the &quot;Big Money Lightning Round&quot;, using a three-step structure in which the winning team attempted to guess three passwords within 30 seconds per step. The contestant was paid as follows:
* Part One: Each password paid $25. Guessing all three passwords in 30 seconds further netted $5 for each second left on the clock. The round ended if the contestant was unable to guess at least one of the three passwords.
* Part Two: The money earned in part one would be multiplied by the number of passwords guessed here. (e.g.: If a contestant guessed all three words in part one and there was 7 seconds left, each word would be worth $110) Naming all three passwords this time added $10 for each second left. If the receiver failed to identify at least one of the passwords here, the round ended and the contestant still kept all part-one winnings; he or she then returned to the elimination panel to compete for the right to play the main game again.
* Part Three: Naming all three passwords in 30 seconds multiplied the contestant&#x27;s part-two winnings tenfold (meaning if a player accumulated $500 after two parts, guessing all three passwords in this part would earn $5,000).

Champions continued until either they were defeated or reached ABC&#x27;s $20,000 winnings limit. Until April, contestants could win no more than $20,000. However, later champions were allowed to win over $20,000 but had to retire immediately upon doing so.

==Broadcast history==
===CBS: 1961–1967===

With Goodson–Todman established as a reliable producer of highly rated games for CBS, including &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, the network gave the new word-association game the 2:00 PM (1:00 Central) time slot, replacing the courtroom-themed game &quot;Face the Facts&quot;. As television&#x27;s first successful celebrity–civilian team game, &quot;Password&quot; attracted a large and loyal audience that made it into a solid Nielsen favorite for nearly five years while shows came and went with great frequency on the other networks. A concurrent prime-time version, which debuted in January 1962, was also successful, but less than the daytime show. Both versions performed strongly in the ratings.

On July 11, 1966, CBS preempted &quot;Password&quot; in favor of live coverage of a press conference held by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara on the progress of the Vietnam War. The other two networks went ahead with their regular schedules because their news divisions had not been granted the power to make programming decisions. A new show beginning that day on ABC, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, attracted some &quot;Password&quot; fans. NBC also benefited from the CBS programming decision, experiencing success with the recently launched soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

Over the next year, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; got higher ratings than &quot;Password&quot;. CBS daytime head Fred Silverman canceled &quot;Password&quot; in the spring of 1967 after squabbles over where the show would be taped (New York City or Hollywood). Silverman wanted the show permanently moved to CBS Television City, where it was moved for part of the 1966–1967 season for taping in color because CBS&#x27;s New York studios had not made the full switch to color. Mark Goodson, however, opposed permanently moving the show to Hollywood.

&quot;Password&quot; was most often taped in New York at CBS-TV Studio 52 (later converted to the Studio 54 discothèque) and CBS-TV Studio 50 (the Ed Sullivan Theater) until the end of the daytime run in 1967. The original CBS version made annual trips to CBS Television City during the 1960s, including once when the CBS New York studios were upgraded for color TV. During its run, &quot;Password&quot; was taped in all four of the studios at different times (31, 33, 41 and 43).

===ABC: 1971–1975===

Goodson-Todman sold reruns of the CBS version to local stations via syndication in the late 1960s, and in some markets, they performed quite well in mid-morning or late-afternoon slots. This prompted ABC to contact Mark Goodson about reviving the game; this time around, Goodson agreed to have the show tape in Hollywood per ABC&#x27;s wishes. &quot;Password&quot; would become Goodson-Todman&#x27;s first show to be staged in Los Angeles full-time rather than New York City. The company eventually moved almost all production to southern California during the 1970s. The show was taped at ABC Studio TV-10, &quot;The Vine Street Theater,&quot; in Hollywood and the ABC Television Center.

The network slated &quot;Password&quot; to replace the cult soap &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; at 4:00 PM (3:00 Central) on April 5, 1971. Some of the more devoted &quot;Shadows&quot; fans threatened ABC with physical disruption of the first tapings of &quot;Password&quot; at the Hollywood studios. These plans never materialized and ABC went ahead, managing strong results against NBC&#x27;s &quot;Somerset&quot; and reruns of &quot;Gomer Pyle, USMC&quot; on CBS.

ABC promoted the show to 12:30 PM (11:30 AM Central) on September 6, where it faced stronger challenges in the form of CBS&#x27; long-running &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Who, What, or Where Game&quot;, which had been on for two years. &quot;Password&quot; held up well there for six months until the network moved it up a half-hour to 12:00 PM (11:00 AM Central) on March 20, 1972, for the new Hatos-Hall game &quot;Split Second&quot;. &quot;Password&quot; came in a solid second to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and out-performed three-year-old CBS soap &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;. CBS replaced &quot;Heart&quot; on March 26, 1973, with the youth-oriented &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, causing &quot;Password&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; to hit ratings trouble that year.

Even though NBC moved &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; on January 7, 1974, from 12:00 PM to 10:30 AM (9:30 Central) in favor of &quot;Jackpot!&quot;, the ABC &quot;Password&quot; was sliding into third place. In May, the show won the first-ever Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show. A large Emmy statue then became part of the set&#x27;s backdrop until the overhaul in November.

Beginning on July 15, 1974, several gimmicks were tried to boost ratings. This included:
* Monty Hall guest-hosting for several weeks; from July 15 to the 26th he did two weeks with Ludden and Elizabeth Montgomery as the celebrities, while the third (September 23–27) was a &quot;Four-Celebrity Charity Week&quot; with Ludden and his wife Betty White competing as a team against celebrities including Richard Dawson, Arlene Francis, Vicki Lawrence, and White&#x27;s mother Tess.
* Several other celebrity-filled weeks for charity were also held from July 29 to August 2, September 16–20, and October 14–18.
* A week (September 2–6) in which Joyce Bulifant and Joseph Campanella played with their children (&quot;Celebrities and Their Children Week&quot;); this was followed by &quot;Celebrities and Their Wives Week&quot; from September 9 to the 13th and a &quot;Celebrity Husbands &amp; Wives Charity Week&quot; from September 30 to October 4.
* Two weeks containing big winners from throughout the show&#x27;s run aired from October 21 to November 1; this was followed from November 4 through the 8th by a week in which the show&#x27;s producers and writers played the game for charity with George Peppard and Linda Kaye Henning.

On November 18 (after one final week of unknown content), the show ran an all-celebrity format called &quot;Password All-Stars&quot;. Although Goodson-Todman had success with celebrity-driven formats such as &quot;Match Game&quot; (which debuted in 1973) and &quot;Tattletales&quot; (which began earlier in the year) through the late 1970s, the lack of civilian contestants and significantly altered rules on &quot;Password&quot; drove more viewers away.

On February 24, 1975, Goodson-Todman abandoned the all-stars format (but changed the contestant configuration in order to avoid another set redesign) in a last-ditch effort to save the program. Although &quot;Password&quot; was given another eighteen weeks, ABC had all but given up on the show. Aside from a week in which Betty White hosted while her husband played (March 24–28), no more gimmicks were attempted for the rest of the run.

On June 27, 1975, four members of the show&#x27;s staff played a &quot;mock game&quot; which filled some time after the final Lightning Round. Mark Goodson then appeared to declare Ludden &quot;Mr. Password&quot; and mentioned that numerous elementary schoolteachers in the U.S. used the various editions of the Milton Bradley-packaged home game as a tool to teach their pupils English. Ludden and White then gave an emotional farewell. For this final episode, the use of hand gestures was permitted since &quot;Showoffs&quot;, the Goodson-Todman game show that would replace &quot;Password&quot; the following Monday, involved the use of charades to communicate the words.

===&quot;Password Plus&quot;===

In 1978, Goodson-Todman tried again and successfully brought &quot;Password&quot; to NBC on January 8, 1979, with Allen Ludden returning as host. It was originally announced in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine as &quot;Password &#x27;79&quot;, in the manner that &quot;Match Game&quot; named its 1973 version with the year. Celebrity guest Carol Burnett remarked during a run-through that with the various new elements the show had adopted, it was &quot;Password Plus&quot;. The name stuck and became the title of the revival. Gene Wood served as the primary announcer (with Johnny Olson and Bob Hilton as substitutes); however, the announcers did not announce the passwords as in previous editions.

Ludden hosted until 1980 when he was forced to step down due to a bout with stomach cancer. Initially, Ludden took a month off from taping to deal with his illness, and Bill Cullen took time off from hosting &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; to step in for him. (During this time Geoff Edwards stepped in for Cullen on &quot;Chain&quot;.) Eventually, Ludden&#x27;s cancer worsened and he left the series after October 24, 1980; he succumbed to the disease in 1981. The producers, reportedly at Ludden&#x27;s request, hired Tom Kennedy - whose TV credits included the &quot;Password&quot;-inspired &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!&quot; - to take over &quot;Password Plus&quot;, and he remained as host until its final episode aired on March 26, 1982.

===&quot;Super Password&quot;===
On September 24, 1984, NBC brought the format back as &quot;Super Password&quot; with Bert Convy hosting; with few tweaks, gameplay remained in the &quot;Password Plus&quot; format. Rich Jeffries was the first announcer until November 23, 1984, and filled in for the returning Gene Wood sporadically thereafter, as did Bob Hilton. As noted above, the tradition of the announcers reading the passwords was reinstated midway through the show&#x27;s run.

&quot;Super Password&quot; ran until March 24, 1989, and was canceled on the same day as another NBC game show, &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;. In some markets in the Eastern time zone, the show was preempted by local news due to its 12:00 PM time slot. NBC stations in the Central and Pacific time zones usually preempted &quot;Scrabble&quot; at 11:30 for local news and aired &quot;Super Password&quot; at 11:00.

===&quot;Million Dollar Password&quot;===

CBS picked up a new version of the show entitled &quot;Million Dollar Password&quot;, hosted by Regis Philbin, which premiered on June 1, 2008, and ran for 12 episodes over two seasons. The series was taped in New York and was the second million-dollar game show that Philbin has hosted (the first being the American network version &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot;). The first season was taped at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City, and the second season was taped at the CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles.

===&quot;Buzzr (YouTube)&quot;===
From March 4, 2015, until June 18, 2016, the Buzzr YouTube channel had an online reboot of &quot;Password&quot; hosted by Steve Zaragoza where various internet celebrities were teamed up as contestants instead of a celebrity and civilian being paired up.

===NBC: 2022===
NBC greenlit a new version of &quot;Password&quot; from Fremantle with Jimmy Fallon as executive producer, on May 17, 2021, during NBCUniversal&#x27;s upfronts presentation. On January 24, 2022, a casting notice was put out. In April 2022, it was reported that Keke Palmer would serve as host, and that the show would premiere in the summer, later specified as August 9. The first episode was dedicated to Betty White. Each hour-long episode consists of two half-hour matches, each with different pairs of contestants. On May 12, 2023, the series was renewed for a second season; however, production was delayed to November 2023 due to Fallon&#x27;s support of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. After a holiday special on December 18, 2023, it was announced on January 29, 2024 that the second season would premiere on March 12, 2024.

The gameplay is reminiscent of the 1961–75 versions, with games played to 15 points and the point value for each password starting at 6 for the first clue. Starting in the second season, someone from each team can &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; if a player can get the other player to get the password. They earn 8 points if they can get the password (2 extra points). If not, the opposing team will have a chance to steal those points (but if neither team gets the password, they lose the chance to try again). &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; can only be used once per game, and can be activated throughout the game. Another addition in the second season is the &quot;Password Prize of the Night&quot;, where correctly guessing the password earns the team points and the player a trip to a Universal Studios theme park. Starting in the second season, the passwords in round two are related to the category, since the passwords are harder. If an illegal clue is given, the opposing team gets two points. Two such games are played, with the celebrities switching partners for the second game; if the contestants each win one game, a tie-breaker round, presented on-screen similarly to the Password Puzzle format from &quot;Password Plus&quot; and &quot;Super Password&quot;, is played. Palmer reads a series of up to five clues to the final password; whoever buzzes in with the correct answer moves on to the bonus round. An incorrect answer, however, allows the opponent to guess with all five clues revealed. If both players answer incorrectly, the procedure repeats until one buzzes in with the correct answer. Starting in the second season, Palmer gives the clues. If a player buzzes in with an incorrect answer, their opponent moves on to the bonus round.

The bonus round uses a modified Alphabetics/Super Password round format (again from &quot;Plus/Super&quot;). The contestant now plays with both celebrities, where they have a total of 60 seconds to guess all ten passwords that begin with consecutive letters of the alphabet. After one celebrity plays for the first 30 seconds, they switch out and gameplay resumes. If an illegal clue is given during the first 30 seconds, a new word beginning with the same letter will be used during the second 30. The contestant wins $1,000 per guessed word, and $25,000 for solving all ten before time runs out. If all ten are not solved in time, the contestant receives one more password, which is not revealed to the home audience, for both celebrities to jointly guess. After giving a single clue, the contestant puts on headphones and turns their back to the celebrities, while they deliberate for up to 30 seconds. If they are correct, the contestant&#x27;s winnings are doubled; if not, they keep their previous winnings.

The final episode of the first season featured four celebrities playing for charity and switching teams for the second half of the episode. One member of the winning team gives the clues in the bonus round and the other guesses the password in 60 seconds. If all ten passwords are not solved, the celebrity gives a clue to the other celebrities and puts on headphones during the deliberation. Fallon, instead of playing in the second half of the episode, let Palmer take his place playing, while he hosted.

==Episode status==
All of the CBS primetime episodes were preserved on videotape, and have aired on GSN and Buzzr. The final year of the CBS daytime version and the second primetime version was preserved on color videotape, as the producers chose to syndicate those reruns following the program&#x27;s first cancellation. Most of the earlier daytime episodes are presumed lost; at least two daytime episodes are available on home video, each one as part of a general game show compilation package. A number of episodes exist in the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

The ABC version is considered to be almost completely gone. Clips from the December 7, 1971, episode featuring Brett Somers and Jack Klugman were featured on VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the &#x27;70s: Volume 2&quot; in 2006. GSN aired the complete Somers/Klugman episode on September 11, 2006, in the early morning hours as part of its weekly overnight classic game-show programming (and aired it again in tribute following Somers&#x27; death). Buzzr aired the complete Somers/Klugman episode on August 8, 2022.

A second studio master from February 14, 1972, with Sheila MacRae and Martin Milner is also known to have survived; the opening of that episode can be seen on YouTube, with the complete episode being uploaded in May 2020. Five episodes from 1975 circulate amongst collectors, three as recorded by home viewers: the &quot;Password All-Stars&quot; Finale; a studio master of episode #15 of the big-money revamp (March 14, 1975) with Betty White and Vicki Lawrence; a kinescope of episode #24 of the revamp (March 27, 1975); a June 1975 episode with Carol Burnett and Jack Cassidy; and the June 27, 1975 finale with Kate Jackson and Sam Melville. An audio recording of an episode featuring Jack Klugman and Loretta Swit from 1975 is also known to have survived. A few more episodes from this run are held in UCLA&#x27;s film and television archive.

It is believed that the videotapes that were used for the ABC &quot;Password&quot; were recycled and reused for the Dawson version of &quot;Family Feud&quot;, which began on July 12, 1976.

Both NBC daytime versions were preserved and have aired in reruns on GSN and Buzzr, though a few select episodes are skipped due to either poor tape condition, puzzles or clues that may be deemed offensive, or celebrity clearance issues.

===Home media===
On December 2, 2008, BCI Entertainment Company LLC (under license from FremantleMedia Enterprises) released a DVD box set &quot;The Best of &quot;Password&quot;, starring Allen Ludden: The CBS Years - 1962–1967&quot;. The set predominantly features the nighttime show, with most of the final disc containing daytime episodes from 1967; notably, despite their existence, neither the nighttime nor daytime finales are present. This 3-Disc set contains 30 episodes of &quot;Password&quot; (1961 daytime episodes and 1962-1967 primetime episodes), uncut and unedited, and also digitally transferred, remastered, and restored from the original B&amp;W kinescopes and original 2-inch color videotapes.

Although &quot;Password&quot; began in 1961, the DVD set consistently states &quot;The CBS Years: 1962–1967&quot;. This misleading title may be due to the earliest episode on the set being the nighttime premiere, which aired in early 1962. A rerelease by Mill Creek, which acquired the rights to the Fremantle game-show DVD sets following BCI&#x27;s collapse, corrected this error.

An early mock-up of the packaging showed host Ludden on the later CBS set, with the original ABC logo on the front of the desk (as well as on the spine), while a slew of celebrities was listed on the bottom of the cover. Further, the press release stated that the set would range &quot;from the early 1960s all the way up to the mid 1970s&quot;, indicating that ABC episodes would be included. A later update to the box art removed the celebrity list and clarified that the set would only cover the CBS era, although the ABC logo was still present (the front cover now had it in place of the CBS logo above Ludden). The ABC logo was omitted altogether when the DVD set was released, with the CBS logo behind Ludden in the original picture being enlarged.

==Proposals==
===1998 version===
According to a November 11, 1997, issue of &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; magazine, it was reported that Gordon Elliott was being prepped to become the brand new host of a version of &quot;Password&quot; planned for syndication in the Fall of 1998, with Pearson/All-American Television to have produced the series. However, those plans never materialized.

===2016 version===
On May 14, 2016, an article from &quot;Buzzerblog&quot; received word from an anonymous but reputable source that &quot;Password&quot; was listed as a possible new alternative series on the internal ABC affiliate website. These plans never materialized.

==International versions==
== Home games ==
The Milton Bradley Company introduced the first home version of &quot;Password&quot; in 1962 and subsequently released 24 editions of the game until 1986. Owing to common superstition, these releases were numbered 1–12 and 14–25, skipping 13. It was tied with &quot;Concentration&quot; as the most prolific of Milton Bradley&#x27;s home versions of popular game shows and was produced well into the &quot;Super Password&quot; era of the television show. Milton Bradley also published three editions of a &quot;Password Plus&quot; home game between 1979 and 1981, but never did a version for &quot;Super Password&quot;.

Since 1997, Endless Games has released seven editions of &quot;Password&quot;, including a children&#x27;s edition (with gameplay closer to the various incarnations of &quot;Pyramid&quot;), a special &quot;50th Anniversary Edition&quot; in 2011 and a DVD edition featuring the voice of Todd Newton (notably, the latter uses the original ABC logo on its packaging). In addition, Endless released a home version of &quot;Million-Dollar Password&quot; in 2008.

A computer version of &quot;Super Password&quot; was released by GameTek for MS-DOS systems, as well as the Apple II and Commodore 64, shortly before the series was canceled. A Nintendo Entertainment System version was also planned but never released. Tiger Electronics released an electronic hand-held &quot;Super Password&quot; game in the late 1990s. More recently, Irwin Toy released a new hand-held electronic version featuring a touch screen with a stylus to enter words.

An online version of &quot;Password&quot; was once available on its now-defunct website &quot;Uproar.com&quot; where instead of just one partner every time, you were allowed to play along with lots of other people in a party atmosphere. However, as of September 30, 2006, the website no longer offers any game show-based online games of any kind.

Interactive online versions of &quot;Password Plus&quot; and &quot;Super Password&quot; were once available from Game Show Network where you would play along while watching the show.

As with several other Goodson-Todman/Goodson game shows, &quot;Password&quot; has been adapted into a slot machine by WMS Gaming. A simulated Allen Ludden emcees the proceedings, with the voices and caricatures of Rose Marie, Dawn Wells, Adam West, and Marty Allen. One bonus round offers the player free spins; the other involves choosing from four envelopes offered by the celebrities. Finding the &quot;Password&quot; envelope advances the player to a new level with four more envelopes, worth more prize money.

<text>The North West Europe campaign was a campaign by the British Commonwealth armed forces in North West Europe, including its skies and adjoining waters during World War II. The term Western Front has also sometimes been used informally. The United States military refers to this campaign as the European Theater of Operations.

Hence the battle honour &quot;North-West Europe&quot; was awarded to any unit involved in land, sea and air campaigns and operations in, over or near Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom during World War II. It includes many more specific campaigns and/or battle honours.

==Subsidiary battle honours==

The battle honour &quot;North-West Europe campaign of 1940, was awarded to some army units that were involved in the Battle of France, and was restricted to the Belgian and French Channel ports. During this campaign, the French Army was responsible for the rest of the Western Front from Luxembourg to Switzerland, much of which was defended by the Maginot Line. The first campaign ended for the British forces with the defeat of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and its evacuation from the beaches of Dunkirk.

Between 1940 and 1944, Commonwealth army units conducted coastal raids in German-Occupied Europe, the largest of which was the Dieppe raid of 1942.

British Commonwealth air force units who served over Occupied Europe, between the fall of France and D-Day were awarded the battle honour &quot;Fortress Europe 1940–1944.&quot;

The battle honour North-West Europe campaign of 1944–45, was typically awarded to units of the British Second Army and First Canadian Army, as elements of the British 21st Army Group. The campaign started with the landings in Normandy and ended on 4 May 1945 with Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery taking the German military surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands, north west Germany and Denmark on Lüneburg Heath, (situated between the cities of Hamburg, Hanover and Bremen).

<text>George Rennie (3 December 1791 – 30 March 1866) was an engineer born in London, England. He was the son of the Scottish engineer John Rennie the Elder and the brother of Sir John Rennie.

==Early life==
Born in the parish of Christchurch, Blackfriars Road, Southwark, London, he was educated by Dr. Greenlaw at Isleworth, and was subsequently sent to St. Paul&#x27;s School and to the University of Edinburgh. In 1811 he entered his father&#x27;s office, where many great works were in progress. In 1818, on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks and James Watt, he was appointed inspector of machinery and clerk of the irons (i.e. dies) at the Royal Mint, which post he held for nearly eight years.

==J. &amp; G. Rennie==

On the death of his father in 1821 he entered into partnership with his younger brother John, as J. and G. Rennie, and for many years they were engaged in completing the vast undertakings originated by the elder Rennie. John concentrated on the civil engineering portion of the business, whereas George supervised the mechanical engineering. Nevertheless, about 1826 he was entrusted with the construction of the Grosvenor Bridge (Chester) over the Dee at Chester, from the designs of Harrison.

In 1825 the brothers were hired by the directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway as George Stephenson&#x27;s original plan had been thrown out of Parliament due to inconsistent figures and measurements This was however, a technicality, as the reason for the Bill&#x27;s failure was the political pressure applied by Lord Derby and Lord Sefton, since the original route encroached on, or near, their estates on the outskirts of Liverpool. So a new route was required. However, the brothers were too busy with existing work, so they subcontracted the work to Charles Blacker Vignoles, and it was he who plotted and surveyed a new route, which was successful in its passage through Parliament, and it the route still used to this day. As soon as the Bill received Royal Assent on 5 May 1826, the Directors wished to appoint the Rennie brothers as principal engineers for the building of the railway, but no agreement could be made over the amount of time the brothers would commit to attending site, and also which other engineers they were prepared to work with on the project, so the Directors offered the job back to George Stephenson.

He had considerable practice as a railway engineer, and made plans for lines to connect Birmingham and Liverpool, the Vale of Clwyd line, the railway from Mons to Manage in Belgium, and the Namur and Liege railway, of which he was appointed chief engineer in 1846.

==Mechanical engineering==

George Rennie&#x27;s genius was chiefly mechanical, and he superintended the manufacturing business of the firm in Holland Street, where a great variety of machinery was turned out, including the first biscuit-making machinery, corn and chocolate mills for Deptford victualling yard, and the machinery at the Royal William Victualling Yard, Plymouth. They also constructed some locomotives for the London and Croydon Railway. Many orders for foreign governments were executed, and the firm were employed by the Admiralty in making engines for the Royal Navy. He was much interested in the screw-propeller, and his firm built the engines for , the world&#x27;s first propeller-driven steamship. Subsequently, in 1840, the firm built for the Admiralty the &quot;Dwarf&quot;, the first vessel in the British navy propelled by a screw.

Roe (1916) discusses Rennie&#x27;s contributions to the development of the planer.

In 1822 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and contributed papers to the Transactions in 1829 on the friction of metals and other substances. He also presented papers to the British Association and to the Institution of Civil Engineers, of which body he was elected a member in 1841.

==Death==
He died on 30 March 1866, at his house, 39 Wilton Crescent, from the effects of an accident in the street in the previous year, and was buried on 6 April at Holmwood, near Dorking. He married, in 1828, Margaret Anne, daughter of Sir John Jackson, 1st Baronet, M.P., who survived him; they had two sons and one daughter.

<doc id="643367" wikidata="Q1143333" url="?curid=643367" title="Häagen-Dazs">
<text>Häagen-Dazs ( , ) is an American ice cream brand, established by Reuben and Rose Mattus in the Bronx, New York, in 1960, owned by Froneri, a joint venture between Nestlé and PAI Partners. Starting with only three flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and coffee, the company opened its first retail store in Brooklyn, New York, on November 15, 1976. The Pillsbury food conglomerate bought Häagen-Dazs in 1983, and now the brand is sold worldwide. Their product offerings include ice cream cartons, ice cream bars, ice cream cakes, sorbet, frozen yogurt, and gelato.

==History==
Häagen-Dazs&#x27;s founder Reuben Mattus was born in Poland in 1912 to Jewish parents. His father died during World War I, and his widowed mother migrated to New York City with her two children in 1921. They joined an uncle who was in the Italian lemon-ice business in Brooklyn. By the late 1920s, the family began making ice pops, and by 1929, chocolate-covered ice cream bars and sandwiches under the name Senator Frozen Products on Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx, delivering them with a horse-drawn wagon to neighborhood stores in the Bronx.

The Senator Frozen Products company was profitable, but by the 1950s the large mass-producers of ice cream started a price war, leading to his decision to make a heavy kind of high-end ice cream. In 1959, he decided to form a new ice cream company with what he thought to be a Danish-sounding name, Häagen-Dazs, as a tribute to Denmark&#x27;s alleged exemplary treatment of Jews during World War II, a move known in the marketing industry as foreign branding. Rose Mattus would dress up in fancy clothing to distribute free samples, giving the ice cream an air of sophistication and class.

The Pillsbury Company bought Häagen-Dazs in 1983. In 1999, Pillsbury and Nestlé merged their U.S. and Canadian ice cream operations into a joint venture called Ice Cream Partners. General Mills, in turn, bought Pillsbury in 2001 and succeeded to its interest in the joint venture. That same year, Nestlé exercised its contractual right to buy out General Mills&#x27; interest in Ice Cream Partners, which included the right to a 99-year license for the Häagen-Dazs brand, until 2110. Since then, pursuant to that license, the Dreyer&#x27;s subsidiary of Nestlé has produced and marketed Häagen-Dazs products in the United States and Canada. In December 2019, Nestlé sold Dreyer&#x27;s along with its rights in the Häagen-Dazs brand to Froneri, a joint venture set up by Nestlé and PAI Partners in 2016.

==Origin of brand name==
&quot;Häagen-Dazs&quot; is an invented pseudo-Scandinavian phrase coined by the American Reuben Mattus, in a quest for a brand name that he claimed was Danish-sounding. However, the company&#x27;s pronunciation of the name ignores the letters &quot;ä&quot; and &quot;s&quot;, and letters like &quot;ä&quot; or digraphs like &quot;zs&quot; do not exist in Danish. According to Mattus, it was a tribute to Denmark&#x27;s exemplary treatment of its Jews during the Second World War, and included an outline map of Denmark on early labels. Mattus felt that Denmark was also known for its dairy products and had a positive image in the United States. His daughter Doris Hurley reported in the 1996 PBS documentary &quot;An Ice Cream Show&quot; that her father sat at the kitchen table for hours saying nonsensical words until he came up with a combination he liked. The reason he chose this method was so that the name would be unique and original.

===More history===
Around 1988 Reuben Mattus gave an evening talk, &quot;How to Build an Empire&quot;, at the Learning Annex in New York&#x27;s upper east side. He said that he used to sell ice cream to candy stores. One store owner said that the ice cream is of poor quality and only buys it to help as a friend. Subsequently, he spent much time in the New York public library researching ice creams and ingredients. He decided to make the best ice cream from then on and based on his research used rum from Boston and chocolate from Belgium. He wanted to differentiate his new product by using an invented exotic Scandinavian sounding name, Häagen-Dazs, and did not mention that this was related to Denmark helping Jews during the Holocaust. He packaged the ice cream in round boxes, which was then an innovation. Grocery store owners complained that this way fewer ice creams fit in the refrigerator. He explained that what counts is how many are taken out and bought, not how many are stored. He said that he never set prices like $0.98, $1.22, but $1.00, $1.25—&quot;honest numbers&quot; also to exude quality.

===Conflict with Frusen Glädjé===
In 1980, Häagen-Dazs unsuccessfully sued Frusen Glädjé, an American ice cream maker founded that year, for using foreign branding strategies. The phrase —without the acute accent—is Swedish for &quot;frozen joy&quot;. In 1985, Frusen Glädjé was sold to Kraft General Foods. A Kraft spokeswoman stated that Kraft sold its Frusen Glädjé license to the Unilever corporation in 1993, but a spokesman for Unilever said that Frusen Glädjé was not part of the deal. The brand has since been discontinued.

==Products==

Häagen-Dazs ice cream comes in several traditional flavors as well as several esoteric flavors that are specific to the brand, such as Vanilla Swiss Almond and Bananas Foster. It is marketed as a &quot;super-premium&quot; brand: it is quite dense (very little air is mixed in during manufacturing), uses no emulsifiers or stabilizers other than egg yolks, and has a high butterfat content. It is sold both in grocery stores and in dedicated retail outlets serving ice cream cones, sundaes, and so on.

Since 1992, most of the world&#x27;s Häagen-Dazs products have been manufactured at a plant in Tilloy-lès-Mofflaines, France that is now controlled by General Mills. In the United States and Canada, Häagen-Dazs is licensed to and produced by Froneri. Häagen-Dazs entered the Japanese market in 1984 by forming a joint venture with Suntory and Takanashi Milk, which has produced their products there ever since. The factory is located in Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture, Japan.

To offset increasing ingredient and delivery costs, Häagen-Dazs downsized their pint ice cream cartons () in the US to in January 2009. In March 2009, they announced that they would be downsizing their quart cartons () to .

<doc id="643370" wikidata="Q1126389" url="?curid=643370" title="Connoquenessing Creek">
<text>Connoquenessing Creek is a tributary of the Beaver River, approximately 50 mi (80 km) long, in Western Pennsylvania in the United States.

==Course==

Connoquenessing Creek rises in eastern Butler County and flows southwest, through the Lake Oneida reservoir and past Butler, then west-northwest in a meandering course past Eidenau where Breakneck Creek is received, and then continuing past Harmony and Zelienople. It receives Slippery Rock Creek from the northwest near Ellwood City, then joins the Beaver west of Ellwood City, approximately 3 mi (5 km) further downstream.

==Watershed==

In 2000, a scientific study was conducted to determine the health of the creek. Researchers discovered that only the Mississippi River received more toxic materials than the Connoquenessing, making the small river the second most polluted waterway in the United States. &quot;The Armco Inc. steel facility in Butler, purchased last September [1999] by AK Steel, ranked first nationally for the amount of pollutant discharges. The steelmaker legally discharged more than 29 million pounds of nitrate compounds -- a waste produced when nitric acid is used to &quot;pickle&quot; or clean the surface of raw steel—into Connoquenessing Creek.&quot;

However, as of 2010, the Connoquenessing Creek was not listed in the national Top 10 for polluted waterways. Also, as of 2010, Armco Inc. steel in Butler was not listed in the Top 20 in regards to national pollutant dischargers.

The creek is a popular canoeing and kayaking destination, with many boaters entering the creek at various locations.

This list is by no means complete. String quartets are written for four string instrumentsusually two violins, viola and cellounless stated otherwise.


==Born in the 16th century==

*Gregorio Allegri (1582–1652): The earliest known composition for two violins, viola and cello (although is referred to as &quot;Duoi Violini, Alto, &amp; Basso di Viola&quot;) is attributed to him. Scholars often refer to it as &quot;Symphonia&quot; or as a four-part sonata. Still, it is the very first example of a composition for this organic which does not involve the use of a basso continuo, which was unusual for that time.

==Born in the 17th century==
*Alessandro Scarlatti (1660–1725): Amongst his output of chamber sonatas, he wrote a set of &quot;Sonate a quattro per due violini, violetta e violoncello senza cembalo&quot; (c. 1715–1725).

<text>Earlham College is a private liberal arts college in Richmond, Indiana. The college was established in 1847 by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and has a strong focus on Quaker values such as integrity, a commitment to peace and social justice, mutual respect, and community decision-making.

Earlham School of Religion is its affiliated graduate seminary.

==History==
Earlham was founded in 1847 as the Friends Boarding School, a boarding high school for the religious education of Quaker adolescents. In 1859, Earlham became Earlham College, upon the addition of collegiate academics. At this time, Earlham was the third Quaker college in the United States (Haverford College was first, Guilford College the second), and the second U.S. institution of higher education to be coeducational (Oberlin College was first). Though the college initially admitted only students who belonged to the Religious Society of Friends, Earlham began admitting non-Quakers in 1865. The college was named for Earlham Hall, home of the Gurneys, an important English Quaker family.

Over time, as Quakerism in America became more progressive, Earlham&#x27;s practices changed with them. The college has still remained faithful to its Quaker roots. 1960 marked the establishment of the Earlham School of Religion, then the only Friends seminary in the world.

In 2017, Earlham appointed Alan C. Price as its first African-American president. Price left the position in July 2018, and in November of that year was appointed director of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.

==Campus==
Earlham&#x27;s campus lies at the southwestern edge of Richmond, Indiana, a city of 35,720 (2020 census). The main quadrangle of the campus is called &quot;the Heart&quot;. It is bordered by Earlham Hall (with the Runyan Center student union directly behind it), Olvey-Andis Hall, Lilly Library, Carpenter Hall, Landrum Bolling Center, the science buildings (Stanley Hall, Noyes Hall and Dennis Hall), Tyler Hall, Bundy Hall and Barrett Hall. Ninety-four percent of Earlham students live on campus in a variety of settings. 

The campus has eight residence halls (Barrett Hall, Bundy Hall, Earlham Hall, Mills Hall, Hoerner Hall, Olvey-Andis Hall, Warren Hall and Wilson Hall). In addition, it has 15 theme and friendship houses, which border the North and East edges of the campus. 

The school has embarked on major campus improvement projects which cost a combined $62.3 million. The science complex (Stanley and Noyes Halls) has undergone a complete renovation. Stanley Hall was completed by fall 2013 and received a LEED Silver certification. A new Center for Science and Technology, completed in 2015, obtained a LEED gold rating. 

While Earlham is predominately an undergraduate institution, it also offers a Master of Arts in Teaching degree.

== Curriculum and community ==
Earlham&#x27;s most popular undergraduate majors, conferred in 2023 graduates, were:
::Biochemistry (19)
::Biology (10)
::Business Administration and Management (14)
::Neuroscience (10)
::Psychology (14)

In keeping with Friends&#x27; belief in equality, everyone addresses each other at Earlham by his or her first name, without the use of titles such as &quot;doctor&quot; or &quot;professor&quot;.

Roughly 70% of Earlham students go on a semester-length off-campus program to such destinations as Mexico, the U.S./ Mexican border, Vienna, Martinique, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain, New Zealand, Japan, and Tanzania.

In the sciences, Earlham places a large emphasis on integrating research into the undergraduate curriculum. Through Ford/Knight grants, most science faculty have been or are currently involved with students in research. Earlham has good representation in the Butler Undergraduate Research Conference, held each year in the spring. Earlham&#x27;s biology and chemistry departments have a long history of producing distinguished graduates, such as Warder Clyde Allee, Jim Fowler, Larry E. Overman, Harold Urey, and Wendell Stanley, the latter two of which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (in 1934 and 1946, respectively). Students and faculty in Earlham&#x27;s CS applied groups jointly provide computer infrastructure support for the college.

The choir department organizes regional and national tours every year for its ensembles. In January 2012, the concert choir performed in Indianapolis, the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, and Chicago. The choral and instrumental music departments collaborate on a biennial basis, performing works such as Carmina Burana and Michael Tippett&#x27;s A Child of Our Time. The college has a full gamelan ensemble, which performs concerts in the Spring. Earlham has an entirely student-managed public radio station, WECI 91.5FM. In addition, 6-10 theater performances occur throughout the year on campus through either the academic department, senior projects or the student company.

Earlham has students from 77 countries, which equates to roughly 200 students. This high diversity is due in part to a strong relationship with the United World College network of international boarding high schools. Since 2004, Earlham College has been a part of the Davis United World Scholars program, which offers need-based scholarships for UWC graduates to continue their education at select institutions in the United States. The Davis Cup, which is awarded to the college with the most current students from this program, has been awarded to Earlham several times. The college also draws from all regions of the United States, with students from 42 states. Domestic minorities represent 15% of the student body.

Earlham is orienting some of the curriculum around exploring local and global problems as well as possible solutions. In 2016, Earlham students won the million dollar Hult Prize for their &quot;Magic Bus&quot; proposal to help with transportation problems in developing urban environments.

Earlham has the United States&#x27; only equestrian program which is run entirely by students. Lessons are available for students of the college and community members. The equestrian center is adjacent to the college-owned 11-acre Miller farm which hosts agricultural interns during the school year and summer and &quot;work days&quot; on Saturdays for the rest of the community during the school year. Miller farm also serves as a residence for upper class students.

In keeping with Quaker tradition, Earlham students voluntarily invest many hours of community service into the Richmond community. Students report an average of 23,000 hours of volunteering work every year and Earlham&#x27;s Bonner program offers financial aid in exchange for volunteering work for students with high financial need.

==Athletics==
Earlham competes in NCAA Division III and in the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference. The women&#x27;s sports are basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, indoor track, lacrosse, outdoor track, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball. The men&#x27;s sports are baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, indoor track, lacrosse, outdoor track, soccer, and tennis.

The football team was organized in 1888 and has been playing games since the 1889 season. As one of the earliest college programs, Earlham has competed against larger foes such as Indiana University, Purdue University, the University of Kentucky, Ball State University, and Butler University. Perhaps the Quakers&#x27; most notable football game was an exhibition game against Japan&#x27;s Doshisha University Hamburgers in 1989. After setting an NCAA Division III record of five consecutive winless seasons, Earlham&#x27;s football program was suspended starting with the 2019 season. In May 2020, the college announced suspension of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf and tennis teams.

Earlham was an NAIA member in all sports until 19xx; they won the NAIA Men&#x27;s Soccer National title in 1963. In the 2010–11 season, the Earlham College Men&#x27;s Tennis team became the first squad in Earlham history to qualify for the NCAA Div. III Championships by winning the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference Tournament title. 

Earlham&#x27;s club teams include Ultimate Frisbee, Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s rugby, the Bike Co-Op, Cheerleaders, Earthquakers (Competitive Dance), Equestrian Program, martial arts groups, Men&#x27;s Volleyball, and Outdoors Club. A $13-million Athletics and Wellness Center opened at the beginning of the Fall 1999 semester. Students are not charged to use the facility, which features an energy center for cardiovascular and strength training, a group fitness studio for aerobics and yoga, Weber Pool (25 meters by six lanes), racquetball courts, tennis courts, a running track, a climbing wall and Schuckman Court (a performance gymnasium with seating for 1,800). In 2007, Earlham opened its new 2,000-seat Darrell Beane Stadium, with a football field and running track.

<text>There are 30 stadiums in use by Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. The oldest ballpark is Fenway Park in Boston, home of the Boston Red Sox, which opened in 1912. The newest stadium is Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, home of the Texas Rangers, which opened in 2020. Two ballparks were built in the 1910s, two in the 1960s, one in the 1970s, one in the 1980s, seven in the 1990s, thirteen in the 2000s, three in the 2010s, and one in the 2020s. Twenty-four ballparks have natural grass surfaces, while six have artificial turf. Eight ballparks do not have corporate naming rights deals: Angel Stadium, Dodger Stadium, Fenway Park, Kauffman Stadium, Nationals Park, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Wrigley Field, and Yankee Stadium. Sutter Health Park is being used temporarily by the Athletics until a new stadium in Las Vegas is completed in 2028. George M. Steinbrenner Field is being used temporarily by the Tampa Bay Rays due to damage to Tropicana Field from Hurricane Milton.

<text>Gardiners Bay is a small arm of the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 10 mi (16 km) long and 8 mi (13 km) wide in the U.S. state of New York between the two flukelike peninsulas at the eastern end of Long Island. It is bounded on its eastern end, where it connects to Block Island Sound, by Gardiners Island and Promised Land.

Adjoining harbors include Three Mile Harbor, Clearwater beach, Acabonack Harbor, and Lazy Point&#x27;s Napeague harbor. Native fish include; Striped Bass, Bluefish, Fluke, Yellowtail, flounder, blackfish, weakfish, Porgy, sea Robbin, and sea skate. The area is fed by the nearby estuaries of Three mile Harbor, Acabonack Creek, and Napeague, which produce ideal environments for shellfish and crustaceans. Blue claw crab, oysters, and hard shell clams, scallops, and conch are abundant throughout these areas.

It is bounded on the western end by Shelter Island. It connects by two channels at the north and south end of Shelter Island to Great Peconic Bay. During the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the bay was controlled by the British, who used Gardiners Island to store provisions. The British fleet assembled in Cherry Harbor in the bay before sailing to Chesapeake Bay to attack Washington, D.C. and burn the United States Capitol.

Gardiners Bay is part of the Peconic Estuary and received the designation as an Estuary of National Significance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1993.

==Pop culture references==

Gardiners Bay is mentioned in the song &#x27;The Downeaster &quot;Alexa&quot;&#x27; by Billy Joel.

<text>Kevin Darnell Mitchell (born January 13, 1962) is an American professional baseball left fielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) and Nippon Professional Baseball from 1984 to 1998. Mitchell was a two-time MLB All-Star and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award and Silver Slugger Award in 1989, when he led the league in home runs and runs batted in.

==Early life==
Mitchell was born and raised in San Diego to Alma Mitchell, who worked as an electrician with the US Navy. Alma separated from Mitchell&#x27;s father, Earl, when Mitchell was two years old. He was raised by his mother and paternal grandmother, Josie Whitfield, who encouraged his participation in sports. Because Mitchell struggled academically, he attended several high schools in San Diego including Lincoln High School, Clairemont High School and Crawford High School, where he claimed to have played water polo. Although he has been credited with graduating from Clairemont and has claimed to have been a high school football star there, Mitchell only attended the school for two months in 1978. He was reportedly involved in street gangs as a youth, but has claimed he was never himself a member; he also claimed to have been shot three times in his youth. His stepbrother, Donald, was killed in a gang fight.

Mitchell reportedly did not play high school baseball. He was signed by the New York Mets as an undrafted free agent following an open tryout at Grossmont College. He was given a $1,500 signing bonus plus $600 monthly in salary.

==Playing career==

===New York Mets===
In &quot;Amazin&quot;&#x27;, Peter Golenbock&#x27;s oral history of the New York Mets, Hall of Fame catcher Gary Carter said he gave Mitchell the nickname &quot;World&quot; for his ability to play in the infield and outfield. Carter spoke fondly of Mitchell&#x27;s talents. Mitchell made his major league debut on September 4, 1984, against the St. Louis Cardinals, appearing as a pinch hitter and flying out in his only plate appearance. He batted .214 with an RBI in seven games to finish the 1984 season.

After spending the 1985 season in the minor leagues, Mitchell returned to the Mets in , batting .277 with 12 home runs and 43 RBI in 108 games. In the tenth inning of Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, after Wally Backman and Keith Hernandez had been retired for the first two outs, Mitchell was called to pinch hit for reliever Rick Aguilera after Gary Carter, the next hitter after Hernandez, singled. Mitchell, who had already gotten out of his uniform and had on his regular clothes, hurriedly put his uniform back on without his protective cup and went to the plate and singled. He would eventually score the tying run on Bob Stanley&#x27;s wild pitch to Mookie Wilson. The Mets went on to win the game and series, giving Mitchell his only World Series ring.

In a July 2007 radio interview with San Francisco sports talk radio station KNBR, Mitchell disputed that he was out of uniform at the time, and stated that he never wore a cup, even when playing infield. When asked why he never wore a cup, Mitchell responded, &quot;I couldn’t find one big enough for my junk.&quot; The interviewer then commented that maybe the increased mobility helped Mitchell to make the famous 1989 barehanded catch of Ozzie Smith&#x27;s fly ball.

On December 11, 1986, the Mets traded Mitchell, Shawn Abner, Stan Jefferson, Kevin Armstrong, and Kevin Brown to the San Diego Padres for Kevin McReynolds, Gene Walter, and Adam Ging. Mitchell played for the Padres for the first half of , batting .245 with seven home runs and 26 RBI in 62 games.

===San Francisco Giants===
On July 4, 1987, Mitchell was traded to the San Francisco Giants as part of a multi-player trade that also sent pitchers Dave Dravecky and Craig Lefferts to San Francisco in exchange for third baseman Chris Brown and pitchers Keith Comstock, Mark Davis, and Mark Grant. While Dravecky was initially considered to be the key to the trade for the Giants, it was Mitchell who emerged as a star player. He hit .306 with 15 home runs and 44 RBI in 69 games with the Giants following the trade. In 1988, Mitchell hit .251 with 19 home runs and 80 RBI in 148 games.

; Most Valuable Player
After two seasons playing primarily at third base, Mitchell had his best season with the Giants in upon being moved to the outfield. In that season, he batted .291 with a league-best 47 home runs and 125 RBI in 154 games, leading the team to the playoffs and winning the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award, the first by a Giant since Willie McCovey in . Mitchell was named to his first All-Star team, and also led the majors in slugging percentage (.635), on-base plus slugging (1.023), total bases (345), and intentional walks (32).

In the 1989 postseason, Mitchell posted a .353 average, two home runs and 7 RBI in the NLCS, helping the Giants to their first World Series appearance since 1962. Mitchell hit safely in every game of the 1989 World Series, batting .294 with a home run, two runs scored, and 2 RBI in the Oakland Athletics&#x27; four-game sweep.

; The barehanded catch
Mitchell set the tone for his charmed 1989 season early in the year with a unique defensive play on April 26. Sprinting toward the left field foul line in St. Louis&#x27;s Busch Stadium, for a ball off the bat of Ozzie Smith, Mitchell realized he had overrun the ball, but was able to reach back and snare the ball with his bare hand.

==== Remainder of Giants tenure ====
Mitchell made another All-Star team in , and finished the season batting .290 with 35 home runs and 93 RBI in 140 games. He ranked among the National League leaders in home runs (third), slugging percentage (.544, third), on-base plus slugging (.904, sixth), total bases (285, eighth), and extra-base hits (61, ninth). In , Mitchell hit .256 with 27 home runs and 69 RBI in 113 games.

===Later career===
On December 11, 1991, Mitchell and pitcher Mike Remlinger were traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for pitchers Bill Swift, Mike Jackson and Dave Burba. Mitchell arrived at spring training 30 pounds (14 kg) overweight, and struggled to begin the season, batting just .222 with two home runs and 20 RBI through the end of May. Starting on June 1, Mitchell rebounded and batted .337 the rest of the way along with seven home runs and 47 RBI in his last 54 games. Overall, he batted .286 with nine home runs and 67 RBI in 99 games with the Mariners.

On November 17, 1992, Mitchell was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for pitcher Norm Charlton. He had a resurgence in two seasons with the Reds, batting .341 with 19 home runs and 64 RBI in just 323 at-bats in 1993 and .323 with 30 home runs and 77 RBI in the strike-shortened 1994 season. However, his weight problems kept him from being more productive. Because of the baseball strike, he opted to play for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks in Japan the following year, where he became the highest-paid player in Japanese history. In Japan, he incurred the displeasure of team management when he chose to travel to the U.S. in mid-season for treatment of knee problems against the team&#x27;s wishes. He spent only two months with the team. It was discovered later that he did indeed need surgery on his knee.

On March 8, 1996, Mitchell signed with the Boston Red Sox as a free agent. He hit .304 with two home runs and 13 RBI in 27 games with Boston before being traded back to the Reds in exchange for infielder Roberto Mejía and pitcher Brad Tweedlie on July 30. Mitchell batted .325 with six home runs and 26 RBI in 37 games for the Reds to close the season.

On December 13, 1996, Mitchell signed with the Cleveland Indians. In May, after teammate Chad Curtis objected to lyrics of a rap song Mitchell was playing in the clubhouse, and shut off the clubhouse stereo, Curtis exchanged punches with Mitchell, who threw Curtis over a ping pong table. Curtis sustained a bruised right thumb in the fight, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Mitchell was designated for assignment on May 24. At the time, he was batting just .153 with four home and 11 RBI in 20 games. Mitchell was released on June 3.

Mitchell signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics on March 9, 1998. After a strong spring training, he made the team&#x27;s Opening Day roster. On August 4, Mitchell was released by Oakland following their game that night. He batted .228 with two home runs and 21 RBI in 51 games with the Athletics. Mitchell played the following two seasons in independent ball before officially retiring.

Since his retirement, Mitchell lives in San Diego, and plays in the San Diego Adult Baseball League for the championship team, the San Diego Black Sox.

==Arrests and suspension==
Mitchell was the subject of a rape investigation in Chula Vista, California, in December 1991. No charges were filed.

After being released from Major League Baseball for the last time, he was arrested in 1999 for assaulting his father during an argument. In the independent leagues as manager of the Sonoma County Crushers in , he was suspended for nine games after punching the opposing team&#x27;s owner in the mouth during a brawl. In 2010, Mitchell was arrested for alleged misdemeanor battery at the Bonita Golf Club in Bonita, California. He was ordered to perform community service and attend anger management classes.

== Career in review ==
In his 13-season career with eight teams, Mitchell batted .284 with 234 home runs, 760 runs batted in, 630 runs scored, 1,173 hits, 224 doubles, 25 triples and 491 bases on balls in 1,223 games.

Mitchell&#x27;s cousin, Keith Mitchell, also played in the major leagues for four teams across four seasons (between 1991 and ), ending his career with a .260 batting average and eight home runs.

<text>Mouse on Mars is a German electronic music duo formed in 1993 by Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma. Their music is a blend of electronic genres including IDM, dub, krautrock, breakbeat and ambient, featuring heavy use of organic analog synth and cross-frequency modulation. Their music also features live instrumentation including strings, horns, drums, bass, and guitar.

==History==
St. Werner, from Cologne, and Toma, from Düsseldorf, are childhood friends who were born on the same day and in the same hospital. They both experimented with electronic music in the mid 1990s. On earlier recordings, their music was primarily krautrock, dub, techno and ambient, and did not feature vocals, but more recent recordings increasingly include vocals from featured guest artists, many of whom have toured with the duo.

Their first album, &quot;Vulvaland&quot;, was released in 1994 on the British record label Too Pure. Sean Cooper of &quot;AllMusic&quot; stated that it is &quot;a wibbly, barely digital match of ambient texturology with experimental strains of techno, dub, and Krautrock.&quot; Their second album, &quot;Iaora Tahiti&quot;, has a much more playful feel and encompasses a wider variety of electronic dance genres. Over the years, their sound has increased in warmth, playfulness and what the duo term &quot;fantastic analysis&quot;. Their sixth album &quot;Niun Niggung&quot; (released on Domino Records in 2000), showed live instruments becoming more prominent. &quot;Idiology&quot;, their seventh album, continued this practice, and on their eighth album, &quot;Radical Connector&quot;, they took more of an accessible &quot;pop&quot; approach; both also increasingly included vocals, primarily from touring drummer Dodo NKishi.

Mouse on Mars regularly perform live as a three-piece, with Toma &amp; St. Werner augmented by drummer Dodo NKishi. In 2005, they released their first live album, titled &quot;Live 04&quot;.

The band released their tenth full album, &quot;Parastrophics&quot;, almost six years later, in February 2012. It was their first album to be released under Modeselektor&#x27;s Monkeytown record label. Following this another six years later, the band reunited with Thrill Jockey to release &quot;Dimensional People&quot; in April 2018.

St. Werner has released solo work under his own name, and as Lithops and Noisemashinetapes.
 St. Werner also partners with Markus Popp of Oval for Microstoria. St. Werner has also collaborated with the renowned visual artist Rosa Barba.
While releasing albums on British indie labels, Mouse on Mars started their own label, Sonig, on which they release their own work and that of other German artists. They have also produced a number of EPs and have recorded music for film soundtracks as well as remixing the work of other musicians.

In 2018 with the release of the Dimensional People release, the band perform under the name of Dimensional People Ensemble, an ensemble of drums, horns, strings, vocals, and electronic instruments, played by robotics and humanoids.

==Collaborations==
Mouse on Mars collaborated in the studio and toured with Stereolab in the mid 1990s – the results can be heard on Stereolab&#x27;s &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; album and the associated &quot;Miss Modular&quot; single, and Mouse on Mars&#x27; &quot;Cache Cœur Naïf&quot; EP. St. Werner and Lætitia Sadier have also performed karaoke duets. 
The duo collaborated with Mark E. Smith of The Fall, firstly on the Wipe That Sound EP in 2004, and then forming the band Von Südenfed in 2007. Their album is called &quot;Tromatic Reflexxions&quot;.

A mini album was released November 2012, titled &quot;WOW&quot;. The album marked the duo&#x27;s first recorded collaboration with the vocalist Dao Anh Khanh, producer Eric D. Clarke and the punk band, Las Kellies.

<text>The Clear Skies Act of 2003 was a proposed federal law of the United States. The official title as introduced is &quot;a bill to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through expansion of cap-and-trade programs, to provide an alternative regulatory classification for units subject to the cap and trade program, and for other purposes.&quot;

The bill&#x27;s Senate version () was sponsored by James Inhofe (R) of Oklahoma and George Voinovich (R) of Ohio; the House version () was sponsored by Joe Barton (R) of Texas and Billy Tauzin (R) of Louisiana. Both versions were introduced on February 27, 2003.

Upon introduction of the bill, Inhofe said, &quot;Moving beyond the confusing, command-and-control mandates of the past, Clear Skies cap-and-trade system harnesses the power of technology and innovation to bring about significant reductions in harmful pollutants.&quot; The Clear Skies Act came about as the result of President Bush&#x27;s Clear Skies Initiative.

In early March 2005, the bill did not move out of committee when members were deadlocked 9-9. Seven Democrats, James Jeffords (I) of Vermont, and Lincoln Chafee (R) of Rhode Island voted against the bill; nine Republicans supported it. Within days, the Bush administration moved to implement key measures, such as the NOx, SO2 and mercury trading provisions of the bill administratively through EPA. It remains to be seen how resistant these changes will be to court challenges.

==Background: The Clear Skies Initiative==
On February 14, 2002, President George W. Bush announced the Clear Skies Initiative. The policy was put together by Jim Connaughton, Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and involved the work of Senators Bob Smith and George Voinovich and Congressmen Billy Tauzin and Joe Barton. The Initiative is based on a central idea: &quot;that economic growth is key to environmental progress, because it is growth that provides the resources for investment in clean technologies.&quot; The resulting proposal was a market-based cap-and-trade approach which intends to legislate power plant emissions caps without specifying the specific methods used to reach those caps. The Initiative would reduce the cost and complexity of compliance and the need for litigation.

Current power plant emissions amounted to 67% of all sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions (in the United States), 37% of mercury emissions, and 25% of all nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Only SO2 has been administered under a cap-and-trade program.

The goals of the Initiative are threefold:
*Cut SO2 emissions by 73%, from emissions of 11 million tons to a cap of 4.5 million tons in 2010, and 3 million tons in 2018.
*Cut NOx emissions by 67%, from emissions of 5 million tons to a cap of 2.1 million tons in 2008, and to 1.7 million tons in 2018.
*Cut mercury emissions by 69%, from emissions of 48 tons to a cap of 26 tons in 2010, and 15 tons in 2018.
*Actual emissions caps would be set to account for different air quality needs in the East and West.

Through the use of a market-based cap-and-trade program, the intent of the Initiative was to reward innovation, reduce costs, and guarantee results. Each power plant facility would be required to have a permit for each ton of pollution emitted. Because the permits are tradeable, companies would have a financial incentive to cut back their emissions using newer technologies.

The Initiative was modeled on the successful SO2 emissions trading program in effect since 1995. According to the President, the program had reduced air pollution more than all other programs under the Clean Air Act of 1990 combined. Actual reductions were more than the law required and compliance was virtually 100% without the need for litigation. Also, he said that only a &quot;handful&quot; of employees were needed to administer the program. The total cost to achieve the reductions was about 80% less than had originally been expected.

Bush mentioned several benefits of the Initiative:
*Reduces respiratory and cardiovascular diseases by dramatically reducing smog, fine particles, and regional haze.
*Protects wildlife, habitats and ecosystem health from acid rain, nitrogen and mercury deposition.
*Cuts pollution further, faster, cheaper, and with more certainty—replacing a cycle of endless litigation with rapid and certain improvements in air quality.
*Saves as much as $1 billion annually in compliance costs that are passed along to consumers.
*Protects the reliability and affordability of electricity.
*Encourages use of new and cleaner pollution control technologies.

==Legislative history==
==Competing proposals==
In May 2004, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) released a study comparing the Clear Skies Act with the Clean Air Planning Act of 2003 (S. 843), introduced by Senator Thomas R. Carper, and the Clean Power Act of 2003 (S. 366), introduced by Senator James Jeffords.

The differences between the three bills are summarized as follows:
*Carbon dioxide emissions: While all three bills implement emissions targets on power sector emissions of NOx, SO2, and mercury, the Clean Air Planning Act and the Clean Power Act also call for limits on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Under the Clean Air Planning Act, greenhouse gas emission reductions outside of the power sector, referred to as offsets, can be used to meet the emission targets for CO2.
*Size of generators covered: All three bills cover emissions from larger generators that generate power for sale, including central station generators and generators at customer sites that sell power they do not use for their own needs. The Clear Skies and Clean Air Planning Acts cover generating facilities 25 megawatts and larger, while the Clean Power Act covers facilities 15 megawatts and larger. The bills have differing provisions regarding the coverage of combined heat and power facilities that generate some power for sale.
*Emissions caps: The bills generally rely on emissions cap and trade programs to achieve the required reductions. Under such programs, allowances will be allocated and covered generators will have to submit one allowance for each unit of emissions they produce. However, for mercury, the Clean Air Planning Act combines a minimum removal target for all plants with an emissions cap, and the Clean Power Act specifies a maximum emissions rate for all facilities and allows no trading of mercury allowances. The Clear Skies Act contains a &quot;safety valve&quot; feature that caps the price that power companies would have to pay for mercury ($2,187.50 per ounce or $35,000 per pound), SO2 ($4,000 per ton), and NOx ($4,000 per ton) allowances. Should one or more of these &quot;safety valves&quot; be triggered, the corresponding cap on emissions would effectively be relaxed.
*Emissions allocation: Under the Clear Skies Act, emission allowances are to be allocated based on historical fuel consumption, what is often referred to as &quot;grandfathering&quot;. Under the Clean Air Planning Act, a grandfathering approach is used to allocate emission allowances for SO2, but allowances for NOx, mercury, and CO2, are allocated using an output-based scheme. Under this approach, referred to as a generation performance standard (GPS), generators are given allowances for each unit of electricity they generate. The number of allowances allocated for each unit of generation changes each year as the total generation from covered sources changes. The use of a GPS dampens the electricity price impacts of the bill but raises overall compliance costs.
*Control technology: In addition to the emission caps, the Clean Power Act also requires that all plants have the best available control technology (BACT) beginning in 2014 or when they reach 40 years of age, whichever comes later. This provision, often referred to as a &quot;birthday&quot; provision, requires older plants to add controls even if the total emissions of covered facilities are below the emission caps.

==Criticisms in opposition==
The law reduces air pollution controls, including those environmental protections of the Clean Air Act, including caps on toxins in the air and budget cuts for enforcement. The Act is opposed by conservationist groups such as the Sierra Club with Henry A. Waxman, a Democratic congressman of California, describing its title as &quot;clear propaganda.&quot;

Among other things, the Clear Skies Act:
*Allows 42 million more tons of pollution emitted than the EPA proposal.
*Weakens the current cap on nitrogen oxide pollution levels from 1.25 million tons to 2.1 million tons, allowing 68% more NOx pollution.
*Delays the improvement of sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution levels compared to the Clean Air Act requirements.
*Delays enforcement of smog-and-soot pollution standards until 2015.

By 2018, the Clear Skies Act will supposedly allow 3 million tons more NOx through 2012 and 8 million more by 2020, for SO2, 18 million tons more through 2012 and 34 million tons more through 2020. 58 tons more mercury through 2012 and 163 tons more through 2020 would be released into the environment than what would be allowed by enforcement of the Clean Air Act.

In August 2001, the EPA proposed a version of the Clear Skies Act that contained short timetables and lower emissions caps . It is unknown why this proposal was withdrawn and replaced with the Bush administration proposal. It is also unclear whether or not the original EPA proposal would have made it out of committee.

In addition, some opponents consider the term, &quot;Clear Skies Initiative&quot; (similarly to the Healthy Forests Initiative), to be an example of administration Orwellian Doublespeak, using environmentally friendly terminology as &quot;cover&quot; for a give-away to business interests.

==Arguments in favor==
Proponents for the CSA argue that the Clean Air Act sets unachievable goals, especially for ozone and nitrogen oxide pollution. Having a clearly defined cap will benefit both industry and the general population because the goals are visible to everyone and industry benefits from cost-certainty. For example, the claim that simply enforcing the Clean Air Act will result in less pollution than the Clear Skies Act assumes that strict measures will be taken in heavily polluting areas, such as Los Angeles and other municipalities. Measures such as transportation control were taken in the 1970s but were withdrawn amid widespread public protest. Proponents of reform argue that a more likely result of following the current Clean Air Act is the continued &#x27;muddling along&#x27; approach to environmental legislation, with most important decisions made in courts on a case-by-case basis after many years of litigation.

<doc id="643402" wikidata="Q7055026" url="?curid=643402" title="North Dakota Legislative Assembly">
<text>The North Dakota Legislative Assembly is the state legislature of the U.S. state of North Dakota. The Legislative Assembly consists of two chambers, the lower North Dakota House of Representatives, with 94 representatives, and the upper North Dakota Senate, with 47 senators. The state is divided into 47 constituent districts, with two representatives and one senator elected from each district. Due to the Legislative Assembly being a biennial legislature, with the House and Senate sitting for only 80 days in odd-numbered years, a Legislative Council oversees legislative affairs in the interim periods, doing longer-term studies of issues, and drafting legislation for consideration of both houses during the next session.

Members of both houses are limited to two four-year terms since January 2023. Prior to this, members were elected without term limits.

The Legislative Assembly convenes in the west chamber of the 19-story Art Deco state capitol building in Bismarck.

==Constitutional mandates==
According to Article IV, Section 1 of the North Dakota Constitution, the Senate must be composed of no fewer than 40 senators, and no more than 54. Similarly, the House of Representatives must be composed of no fewer than 80 and no more than 108 representatives. Section 2 states that the Legislative Assembly can divide the state into as many legislative districts of compact and contiguous territory as there 
are senators. A senator and at least two representatives must be apportioned to each senatorial district and be elected at large or from subdistricts from those districts. The Legislative Assembly may combine 
two senatorial districts only when a single member senatorial district includes a federal facility or federal installation, containing over two-thirds of the population of a single member senatorial district, and may provide for the election of senators at-large and representatives at-large from subdistricts from those districts.

On September 1, 1970, North Dakota voters approved calling a constitutional convention. As part of the convention, on April 28, 1972, North Dakota held a ballot referral on whether the legislature should remain bicameral or become unicameral. While voters approved a change to a unicameral legislature by nearly 70-30, it would have only taken effect if the voters also approved the new state constitution on the same ballot, but it was rejected 62.69-37.31.

In addition to a four-year term for both houses of the Legislative Assembly, Section 3 states that one-half of the members of the Senate and one-half of the members of the House of Representatives must be elected biennially. Originally, the North Dakota Constitution limited members of the North Dakota House of Representatives to two-year terms, with the all representatives standing for reelection at the same time. In 1996, the voters approved a constitutional amendment that changed the term for representatives to four-years with staggered terms. The amendment went into effect July 1, 1997, and was first applied in the 1998 elections. In 2022, they also approved another amendment, a measure that imposed a two-term limit for assembly members elected since that year.
All statutes passed by the Legislative Assembly and signed by the governor become part of the North Dakota Century Code.

==Qualifications==
Members of both houses elected to the Legislative Assembly must be, on the day of the election, a qualified elector from their home district and must be a resident of North Dakota for one year immediately prior to their election.

==Legislative management==
Due to the biennial nature of the legislature, legislation, research, committee reports, and testimony during interim periods is provided by the Legislative Management. Legislative Management consists of 17 legislators, including the majority and minority leaders of both houses and the Speaker of the House. The Speaker appoints six other representatives, three from the majority party and three from the minority party as recommended by the majority and minority leaders, respectively. The Lieutenant Governor, as President of the Senate, appoints four senators from the majority and two from the minority as recommended by the majority and minority leaders, though the Senate President does not sit on Legislative Management.

==Meeting places==

Built between 1883 and 1884, the original territorial (and later) state capitol building served as the home to the Legislative Assembly until the morning of December 28, 1930, when the original building burned down. During the fire, Secretary of State Robert Byrne saved the original copy of the state constitution, but suffered cuts and burns on his hands while breaking a window to reach the document. In the interim period without a capitol, the Legislative Assembly convened in both the War Memorial Building and the City Auditorium in Bismarck. Under the approval of Governor George F. Shafer, the current Art Deco capitol was built as a replacement between 1931 and 1934 in the midst of the Great Depression.

<text>The Aschiza are a section of the Brachycera. Two large families, the Syrphidae and the Phoridae, and a number of smaller taxa are in this group. They are similar to most of the familiar Muscomorpha with one notable exception; they do not possess a ptilinum, so lack the prominent ptilinal suture on the face as in other muscoid flies. They do still have a puparium with a circular emergence opening, but it is not as precisely ellipsoid in shape as is typical for other muscoids.
The term was first used by Eduard Becher .
