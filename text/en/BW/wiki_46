<text>Thanks-Giving Square is a private park and public facility anchoring the Thanksgiving Commercial Center district of downtown Dallas, Texas, United States. Dedicated in 1976, the complex consists of three components: a landscaped garden and non-denominational chapel building, a major section of the underground pedestrian network, and the Bullington Truck Terminal. It was the first public-private partnership of its kind in Dallas.

After a lengthy global search, Peter Stewart, a Dallas businessman and one of the founders of the Thanks-Giving Foundation, chose architect Philip Johnson to design the project.A symbolic structure was the key part of the program for the square, and it became pretty obvious soon that some of these top architects didn&#x27;t have the background or feeling for the building that I envisaged would carry great meaning for another two hundred years.

==Project==

The Thanks-Giving Foundation was started to create a public space in the center of Dallas dedicated in gratitude to God and to this most ancient and enduring tradition.
Partnering with the City of Dallas, construction began in 1973 and the Square was dedicated in November 1976 as one of the city&#x27;s three United States Bicentennial projects. President Gerald Ford later recognized Thanks-Giving Square as a major national shrine. It welcomes people of all cultures and religions are welcome to celebrate values, thoughts, and spirituality in a contemplative setting.
Concurrent to private development, the City of Dallas constructed transportation infrastructure below the landscaped garden. The City of Dallas leases the land and subsurface from the Thanks-Giving Foundation, but owns the underground structures.

==The garden, chapel, and grounds==

Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Philip Johnson was commissioned to bring the vision of Thanks-Giving Square to life. The Square is set fifteen feet below ground level with a four-foot wall blocking the sight of automobiles to create a serene, green island. Water plays a prominent role in the landscape, with active fountains masking city noise.

Overt religious symbolism is intentionally absent from the decoration of Thanks-Giving Square. Granite markers include references from Scripture, and the 100th Psalm is featured prominently in quotes and messages as delineated by Hindu, Jewish, Christian and Muslim authorities. Mosaic, stained glass, engraving, and graphic art adorn the walls and windows throughout Thanks-Giving Square.

===Court of All Nations===
At the western end of the park is the Court of All Nations, the ceremonial entryway that contains the Wall of Praise (featuring a portion of the text from Psalms 100) and Norman Rockwell&#x27;s &quot;Golden Rule&quot; mosaic. The Ring of Thanks is a diameter aluminum ring is covered in 23 carat (96%) gold leaf. Visitors can walk through the ring before passing under a Bell Tower featuring three bronze bells designed in the form of the Liberty Bell.

===Center Court of Praise===
In the middle of the garden is the Center Court of Praise, which takes inspiration from public gathering spaces around the world. It is here that special events have celebrated “gratitude on the move” through speech, song, and dance. The aluminum and gold ring and nearby text reference this message found in Psalm 100. This area regularly holds special events, memorial services, and citywide prayer vigils (such as the one held after the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers).

===Grove===
The Grove is a garden area designed for meditation and contemplation. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush dedicated the Wall of Presidents, a special display area celebrating the prayer and thanksgiving words of American presidents.

===Hall of Thanksgiving===
Below the chapel is the Hall of Thanksgiving, which tells the story of the American Thanksgiving tradition. The Hall of Thanksgiving is the exhibition, meeting, and resource center for Thanks-Giving Square. The pillared hall receives dignitaries and provides a forum for lectures, interfaith meetings, and educational programming. Artifacts on display include the Book of Prayers and presidential proclamations.

===Chapel of Thanksgiving===
The Chapel of Thanksgiving is the spiritual center of Thanks-Giving Square open to visitors of all faiths. The spiraling shape rises 90 feet (27.5 m) above street level, suggesting the infinite upward reach of the human spirit. The chapel&#x27;s design takes its inspiration from the Great Mosque in Samarra, Iraq (itself derived from the square, spiral Pillar of Gor in Iran) and the ancient spiral of life. The entrance to the chapel is at the end of a 125-foot (38 m) bridge that runs over a cascading waterfall. The chapel ceiling contains the stained glass &quot;Glory Window&quot;, one of largest horizontally mounted stained-glass pieces in the world. The 73 panels of faceted glass were designed by Gabriel Loire of Chartres, France featuring warmer and brighter colors as the spiral reaches its apex in the center. The window appears in a shot in director Terrence Malick&#x27;s 2011 film The Tree of Life. Above the entry door is the etched glass window &quot;The Spirit of Thanksgiving,&quot; designed by glass engraver John Hutton. Artwork by artist Bjørn Wiinblad is also on display. Visitors are encouraged to leave a personal statement of gratitude upon entering.

==Pedway Network==
A major node of the Dallas Pedestrian Network is situated one level below the garden, connecting several adjacent buildings with corridors lined in restaurant and retail space. Consecutive construction with the garden above allowed for skylights, wide walkways and several colorful atriums to disguise the fact that pedestrians are several feet underground. Unlike other portions of the pedway network that were privately constructed, the section beneath Thanks-Giving Square is operated by the City of Dallas. The network is accessed from the Center Court of Praise during business hours. Escalators bring the network to ground level at Bullington Street, which serves as a pedestrian mall and connects to the Bullington-Akard Skywalk. As of 2016, many of the access points had been closed.

==Bullington Truck Terminal==

Thanks-Giving Square was originally planned as the first of several traffic-relieving complexes in downtown Dallas. The Bullington Truck Terminal, one of the key features in the Ponte-Travers-designed plan for downtown circulation, was constructed to consolidate street-level delivery trucks following Dallas&#x27; rapid growth in the 1960s. By placing truck traffic below-grade, it was estimated that 350 trucks per day would be removed from ground-level streets. The city issued $6.5 million for the project as part of the 1972 city bond program; construction was finished in 1977.

The city-owned truck terminal lies 50 feet below ground and contains 43 spaces for trucks, which enter from a portal located at Patterson Street. Adjacent buildings such as the Republic Center, Energy Plaza, Thanksgiving Tower and Fidelity Union Tower built connections to the truck terminal at their own expense and use it as their primary loading dock. Despite plans for several similar facilities in the Dallas Central Business District; the Bullington Truck Terminal was the only one funded and completed.

<text>The Game Boy Camera, released as in Japan, is an accessory for Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy game console. It was released on February 21, 1998, in Japan, and manufacturing ceased in late 2002. As a toy for user-generated content, it can be used to shoot grayscale photographs, edit them or create original drawings, and transfer images between GBC units or to the 64DD art game suite &quot;Mario Artist&quot;. The accessory featured a 180°-swivel front-facing camera that allowed users to capture selfies. Its images can be printed to thermal paper with the Game Boy Printer. The GBC&#x27;s cartridge contains minigames based on Nintendo&#x27;s early games such as the arcade video game &quot;Space Fever&quot; and the Game &amp; Watch handheld game &quot;Ball&quot;, and a chiptune music sequencer; photographers have embraced its technological limitations as artistic challenges. 

==Overview==
The Game Boy Camera (GBC) interfaces with the Game Boy Printer, which utilizes thermal paper to print saved images. Both the camera and the printer were marketed by Nintendo as light-hearted entertainment devices aimed mainly at children in all three major video game regions of the world: Japan, North America, and Europe. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; (which has since been superseded by NGamer) dedicated a monthly section to the device.

The GBC is compatible with all of the Game Boy line except Game Boy Micro. Video output is possible via the Super Game Boy for the Super NES and the Game Boy Player for the GameCube. The camera has a 128×128 pixel CMOS sensor, and can store 128×112, grayscale digital images using the 4-color palette of the Game Boy system.

The Game Boy Camera line has five different standard colors of models: blue, green, red, yellow, and clear purple (Japan only). There is a limited edition gold themed for &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, which contains unique stamps, and was available only in the United States through a mail-order offer from &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;.

In September 2020, information was leaked of an unreleased &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; version of the camera.

===Functionality===

The camera is controlled, images are manipulated, and minigames are played by Game Boy software running from the camera&#x27;s attached cartridge. Individual photographs can be taken and edited with features including a delay timer, time lapse, trick lenses like mirroring and scaling, montage, and panorama for stitching together component photos into one large image. The user can further edit the images by placing Nintendo&#x27;s stamps, or by freehand doodles. Images can be combined as frames of an animation. Images can be interconnected with clickable hyperlinks in &quot;hot spots&quot; mode.

Images can be transferred via the cable, to be printed on the Game Boy Printer, copied between GBC units, or copied via the Nintendo 64 controller&#x27;s Transfer Pak to a 64DD floppy disk. The Japanese GBC is optionally integrated into the &quot;Mario Artist&quot; suite of multimedia games for the 64DD peripheral. There, users can create drawn and 3D-animated avatars of themselves based on photographs taken with the camera, integrate these personalized avatars into various 64DD games including &quot;Mario Artist&quot; and &quot;SimCity 64&quot;, or post art on the Internet through Randnet. Third-party vendors have reverse engineered the GBC system to create modern transfer methods such as USB, SD cards and Wi-Fi.

The GBC cartridge&#x27;s software has numerous references to other Nintendo products. There are a few differences between the North American and Japanese versions, including the unlockable B album pictures and the stamps that can be placed on pictures. The software has a few Easter eggs, some of which have been described as &quot;creepy&quot;, When The developers made disturbing pictures with it. 

Nintendo reportedly had plans to release a successor to the Game Boy Camera for the Game Boy Advance called the GameEye which would take color photos and feature connectivity with the GameCube through a game titled &quot;Stage Debut&quot;, but neither the GameEye nor &quot;Stage Debut&quot; were released.

===Minigames===

*&quot;Space Fever II&quot; is a sequel to the early Nintendo arcade game &quot;Space Fever&quot;. In this minigame, the player controls a spaceship which fires missiles at other ships throughout three unique levels, followed by a boss at the end of each level. The first boss is a giant face of a man with horns, the second boss is a giant face of a mustachioed man, and the third boss is the Game Face. Once all three of the bosses are beaten, the cycle will restart with increased difficulty. At the beginning of the game, two spaceships appear; shooting the &quot;B&quot; ship will enter the &quot;Ball&quot; minigame, and shooting the &quot;D&quot; ship will enter &quot;DJ&quot;. By avoiding both of the ships, the player will begin playing &quot;Space Fever II&quot;. After scoring 2,000 points there, a new minigame called &quot;Run! Run! Run!&quot; will be unlocked, where a new ship marked with a &quot;?&quot; will appear at the beginning.
*&quot;Ball&quot; is a juggling game, in which the player moves the hand around to catch and throw balls. It is a variation of the Game &amp; Watch game &quot;Ball&quot;, only with Mr. Game &amp; Watch&#x27;s head replaced with the Game Face. The background music to this game is &quot;Mayim Mayim&quot;, an Israeli folk song.
*&quot;DJ&quot; is an open-ended music video game with a music sequencer known as Trippy-H where players can mix and create simple chiptunes. The Game Face is the DJ.
*&quot;Run! Run! Run!&quot; is the bonus minigame. The Game Face is attached to a cartoon body, and the player races against a mole and a bird for the finish line. By clearing this minigame in under 22 seconds, the credits are unlocked.

==Development==

Initially, the Game Boy Camera was not well received within Nintendo. However, Masato Kuwahara approached Creatures, Inc. President Hirokazu Tanaka regarding the development of the software for the device, which solidified the project. The camera&#x27;s built-in software was co-developed by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1 and the Japanese company Jupiter, with Tanaka directing the project. The Game Boy Camera was launched with an initial MSRP of .

==Legacy==

The Camera sold close to 500,000 units in its first three weeks of availability in Japan.

As one of the earliest consumer digital cameras, the GBC has been legitimized for user-generated content, especially photography. Modern computer connectivity has required experimentation for image retrieval.
The cover art of Neil Young&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot; was taken using a Game Boy Camera.

In 2000, a professional photographer created a color workflow similar to the world&#x27;s earliest color photography, to process GBC&#x27;s grayscale photos through red, green, and blue filters to produce a color photograph. An artist using a Game Boy Camera and three colour process has developed a series of works since 2012, focussing on how the interplay between what the abstracted images reveal and conceal about the photographed environment. As well as using the Game Boy printer within his practice. A PhD student performed astrophotography of scenes including Jupiter, through academic telescopes using GBC. In 2017, a research engineer developed a neural network application to automatically convert GBC monochrome images into color images. Several modern smartphone apps have modes to simulate GBC image quality. In 2016, an Instagram artist included the vintage GBC hardware in his repertoire of high-technology stylized filters, creating a new gallery dedicated only to GBC photography, because its primitive camera &quot;forces you to find a way to take beautiful pictures&quot;.

<text>Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport (German: &quot;Flughafen Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden&quot;) is the international airport of Karlsruhe, the third-largest city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, and also serves the spa town of Baden-Baden. It is the state&#x27;s second-largest airport after Stuttgart Airport, and the 15th-largest in Germany with 1,800,355 passengers as of 2024 and mostly serves low-cost and leisure flights.

The airport itself is part of &quot;Baden Airpark&quot;, a business park with numerous other tenants. It is located in Rheinmünster, south of Karlsruhe, west of Baden-Baden, east of Haguenau and north of Strasbourg, France.

==History==
===Early years as a military airport===
The construction of a military airfield began in December 1951 in the Upper Rhine Plain between the Black Forest and the Rhine River under the supervision of the French Air Force. The runway and associated facilities were completed by June 1952. The airfield was granted to Canadian forces and became a military base, &quot;RCAF Station Baden–Soellingen&quot;, later renamed CFB Baden–Soellingen, from 1953 until 1994.

The newly founded Baden Airpark GmbH took over the former military airfield to develop it into a regional airport and business park. Technically, the airport itself today is part of the &quot;Baden Airpark&quot;, which also includes business facilities.

===Public operations===
The first commercial flight from Hapag-Lloyd Flug (now TUI fly Deutschland) took place in April 2001 with service to Palma de Mallorca and Ibiza. In 2008 the airport counted over one million passengers within a year for the first time.

On 25 October 2011, Ryanair announced it would open its 47th base at Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden in March 2012 with two based aircraft and 20 routes. In addition to Ryanair&#x27;s then existing 12 routes Ryanair opened seven additional routes to Faro, Málaga, Palma, Riga, Thessaloniki, Vilnius and Zadar. In July 2018, TUI fly Deutschland announced that it would terminate its operations at the airport, cancelling seven year-round and seasonal leisure routes to the Canaries and the Mediterranean.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport consists of one passenger terminal building equipped with 20 check-in counters and eight departure gates as well as some shops and restaurants. 

===Runway===
The apron features eight aircraft stands of which most can be used by mid-sized aircraft such as the Boeing 737. Due to the location of the terminal building walk stands and buses are used for boarding. Due to its extensive runway and facilities, Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport is frequently used by major airlines for training flights.

<text>[[Nepal]] contains most of the Himalayas, the highest mountain range in the world. Eight of the fourteen eight-thousanders are located in the country, either in whole or shared across a border with China or India. Nepal has the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest at an astonishing height of 8,848.86m as well as 1,310 peaks over 6,000 m height.

==Mountains==

==Other ranges==
North of the Greater Himalayas in western Nepal, ~6,100 metre &quot;Tibetan Border Ranges&quot; form the Ganges-Brahmaputra divide, which the international border generally follows. South of the Greater Himalayas, Nepal has a &quot;High Mountain&quot; region of ~4,000 metre summits, then the &quot;Middle Hills&quot; and Mahabharat Range with 1,500 to 3,000 metre summits. South of the Mahabharats, an outer range of foothills with ~1,000 metre summits is called the Siwaliks or &quot;Churiya Hills&quot;.

<doc id="644991" wikidata="Q5224657" url="?curid=644991" title="Darrell Johnson">
<text>Darrell Dean Johnson (August 25, 1928 – May 3, 2004) was an American Major League Baseball catcher, coach, manager and scout. As a manager, he led the 1975 Boston Red Sox to the American League pennant, and was named &quot;Manager of the Year&quot; by both &quot;The Sporting News&quot; and the Associated Press.

==Playing career==
Johnson was born in Horace, Nebraska, and graduated from Harvard, Nebraska, High School in 1944. He was signed by the St. Louis Browns as an amateur free agent in 1949 and made his Major League debut with the Browns on April 20, 1952. A reserve catcher during his six-year Major League career (; –; –), Johnson also played for the Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore Orioles, who released him on June 12, 1962, ending his playing career. He was listed as tall and and threw and batted right-handed. In 134 MLB games played, he batted .234 lifetime, with his 75 hits including six doubles, one triple and two home runs.

Johnson&#x27;s playing career was interrupted by an eleven-month stint as an MLB coach with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1960–1961. After playing in eight games, with three plate appearances, for the Cardinals, he was released as a player on August 5 and added to the coaching staff of manager Solly Hemus, then reappointed for . When the Redbirds fired Hemus on July 6, 1961, Johnson was released along with him. Three days later, he signed a player&#x27;s contract with the last-place Philadelphia Phillies and caught 21 games for them in five weeks before being sold to the pennant-contending Cincinnati Reds on August 14.

The Reds were then games behind the first-place Los Angeles Dodgers, but over the final six weeks of the season they overtook the Dodgers to win the National League championship by four full contests. Johnson appeared in 20 games (including 17 as the club&#x27;s starting catcher, with the Reds going 8–9). In limited duty, he batted .315 with 17 hits, including his second and last big-league home run, hit off the Dodgers&#x27; Johnny Podres on August 16. He appeared in the 1961 World Series against his former team, the Yankees, and had two singles in four at bats (both of them off Baseball Hall of Famer Whitey Ford) as the Reds lost to the slugging Yanks of Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle, four games to one. He started Games 1 and 4, both of them Cincinnati defeats.

The Reds released Johnson only a few days into the 1962 season, and he signed with the Orioles as a backup catcher before retiring as a player in June and serving out the year as Baltimore&#x27;s bullpen coach.

==Manager of Red Sox, Mariners and Rangers==

===Overview===
He then became a minor league manager in the Orioles system and won championships with the Rochester Red Wings of the Triple-A International League in 1964 and Elmira Pioneers of the Double-A Eastern League in 1966. His demotion was the result of an exchange requested by Red Wings president Morrie Silver, who was disappointed with a losing 1965 campaign and wanted the Pioneers&#x27; Earl Weaver, coming off a winning season, to manage his team instead. 

After a year spent scouting for the 1967 Yankees, Johnson was named pitching coach of the Boston Red Sox on October 31, , succeeding Sal Maglie who had been released after the World Series. When manager Dick Williams was fired in September , Johnson was retained by the Red Sox as a scout in 1970, then managed Boston&#x27;s Louisville Colonels International League affiliate in 1971–72. In 1973, he became the first manager of the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, finishing 78–68 and winning his second Governors&#x27; Cup, emblematic of the International League&#x27;s playoff championship, in his only PawSox season. That championship earned him a promotion to the parent club as Red Sox manager.
As a big-league manager, Johnson led three different teams over eight seasons. His career began when he succeeded Eddie Kasko following the conclusion of the Red Sox&#x27;s 1973 campaign on September 30. His biggest success came during his Red Sox posting when he compiled a win–loss record of 220–188 for a .539 winning percentage. He guided Boston to a 95–65 (.594) mark in and a first-place finish in the AL East. The Sox then swept the three-time defending world champion Oakland Athletics in the playoffs, 3–0, to win the American League pennant. But they lost to the Cincinnati &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; in the thrilling 1975 World Series, four games to three. In an interview conducted by Tim Russert on CNBC in 2003, Baseball Hall of Fame catcher Carlton Fisk named Johnson as the biggest influence in his professional life. Johnson also had his detractors, such as Bill Lee, who stated that the team won &quot;despite our manager&quot;, who did not communicate well with his players and even had his pitching coach stationed in the Red Sox bullpen rather than the dugout during the 1975 Series. 

In , Boston started poorly, losing 15 of its first 21 games, then rallied and finally climbed above the .500 mark on July 6 (38–37). As the incumbent pennant-winning manager, Johnson managed the 1976 American League All-Star team (with his team losing 7–1 at Veterans Stadium on July 13). But by then the Red Sox were mired in another slump, and only five days later on July 19, Johnson was fired in favor of third-base coach Don Zimmer after the team had lost eight of its last 11 games. At the time of his dismissal, Boston was out of contention with a 41–45 record, in fifth place and 13 games behind the Yankees. Johnson then briefly returned to scouting for the Red Sox.

Johnson was hired to become the first-ever manager of the expansion Seattle Mariners on September 3, 1976. Lou Gorman, Seattle&#x27;s director of baseball operations, stated that Johnson would also assist in scouting players for the upcoming expansion draft. Johnson said that he was looking for players with &quot;pride, aggressiveness, and the right mental attitude.&quot; Johnson manager the Mariners for approximately three and a half seasons until he was fired on August 3, , and posted an overall win–loss mark of 226–362 (.384). 

Johnson then worked as third-base coach for the Texas Rangers, under Zimmer, starting in before taking over as interim manager on July 30, 1982. Six years earlier, the roles had been reversed when third-base coach Zimmer succeeded Johnson as manager in Boston on July 18, 1976. In his final managerial role, Johnson&#x27;s Rangers went 26–40 (.394) in the season&#x27;s final two months. He finished with a 472–590 record for a .444 career percentage as a Major League manager.

He then moved to the New York Mets as minor league coordinator of instruction and a longtime scout. He also served as the Mets&#x27; bench coach on the staff of Dallas Green from May 20, 1993, through the end of that season.

Johnson died from leukemia at the age of 75 in 2004 in Fairfield, California.

<text>Magyar Televízió (, Hungarian Television) or MTV is a nationwide public television broadcasting organization in Hungary. Headquartered in Budapest, it is the oldest television broadcaster in Hungary and today airs five channels: M1 HD, M2 HD, M3, M4 Sport and M5. 

MTV is managed and primarily funded by the Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (, abbreviated MTVA). This government organization, formed in 2011, also manages the public service broadcasters Magyar Rádió and Duna Televízió as well as the Hungarian news agency Magyar Távirati Iroda.

On 1 July 2015, Magyar Televízió as well as the three other public media organizations managed by the MTVA were merged into a single organization called Duna Médiaszolgáltató.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTVA/Duna Media Service Announcement&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This organization is the legal successor to Magyar Televízió and is an active member of the European Broadcasting Union.

==History==

=== Early years (1954–1969)===
First pioneer transmissions were in Hotel Gellért in 1936. Test transmissions commenced in 1954, however these were generally with stills or short clips of motion pictures, merely for experimental purposes. Regular test transmissions could be received from 23 February 1957. Transmissions began officially on 1 May 1957, when the May Day ceremonies were brought to the viewers for the first time. Daily news programmes began on 2 July 1957. The television service began its career as part of Hungarian Radio, which was renamed &quot;Hungarian Radio and Television&quot; on August 18, 1957. MTV suggested the establishment of an international organisation for exchanging television material, which was to be named Intervision. The first four members of the organisation were Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary and Poland.
By 1959, Hungarian Television had over 50,000 subscribers. In 1960, the Corporation decided to establish an archive, where its programmes are stored even today. In less than ten years of operation, MTV had some 2.7 million viewers by 1964. Studies showed that there were about 3-5 viewers per television set. Another study revealed that by 1965, 46% of the inhabitants of rural areas named television as their choice of entertainment, instead of reading (25%) or radio (10%).

Theatrical transmissions were popular at this time: in 1966 23 plays were broadcast from Budapest, 20 from other cities. Also, 25 television movies and five musicals were transmitted this year.

1969 brought the one millionth subscriber, which meant about 4 million viewers. The first colour recording was made this year: it was Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;The Miraculous Mandarin&quot;. Although the Orion company presented its first colour television set, transmissions continued to be in black-and-white until 1971.

===The 1970s===
1971 brought the first regular transmission in colour, and the test transmissions of a second channel were begun as well. This decade was probably the most proliferous in the history of the whole company, with thousands of hours of programming made. &quot;Mazsola és Tádé&quot;, a Hungarian puppet animated children TV series was produced between 1969 and 1973.

===The 1980s===
Annual programming time reached 4.300 hours, equalling to 83 hours a week. Teletext services commenced in 1981, called &quot;Képújság&quot; (Picture Newspaper), and television manufacturers started including teletext decoders in their sets. Long-running programmes were started in this decade, including &quot;Ablak&quot; (Window) and &quot;Panoráma&quot; (a foreign affairs programme). Regional programming began in 1984 in Pécs, and cable television began in Székesfehérvár the same year. &quot;RTV&quot;, a programme guide similar to BBC&#x27;s &quot;Radio Times&quot; was bought by 1.4 million viewers weekly. MTV&#x27;s gradual decline began in 1985, this was the final year when MTV was self-sufficient.

The first broadcast of a telenovela on Hungarian television happened in the mid-1980s with the premier of the Brazilian &quot;Escrava Isaura&quot; (Hungarian title: &quot;Rabszolgasors&quot; - &quot;Slave Destiny&quot; in English). The first Hungarian soap opera &quot;Szomszédok&quot; (Hungarian for &quot;Neighbours&quot;) also started its 12-year-run on 7 May 1987 and was broadcast every second Thursday.

By the late 1980s, experimental digital television recordings were made, but at the time only in studios. From 1988 seniors of 70 years were exempted from payment of the licence fee. Minority programmes in other languages began too: these programmes were recorded generally in regional studios, primarily in Pécs and Szeged. MTV2 was given some independence from its sister channel MTV1, and just like at the BBC, they were given separate controllers.

By 1989 the service began broadcasting five days per week to prepare the seven days, as previously Monday only. Some exceptions were made from this practice, for example when the first Hungarian cosmonaut, Bertalan Farkas entered space. &quot;Nap-kelte&quot; (Daybreak), a daily television magazine programme began in 1989, the first programme to be made by an independent Hungarian television company, namely Nap-TV.

===The 1990s===
With the changeover from socialism, MTV was completely re-structured, some posts were abolished while others were created. Some programmes were axed from both channels, and new ones were started. This decade was a very hectic time in the life of the company, as TV-presidents seemed to come and go, and so did the programmes.

MTV was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union on January 1, 1993, upon the merger of OIRT and EBU. In 1992, a new public service television station was started, and was named Duna Televízió. This was completely independent from MTV, although some collaboration exists between the two. Commercial channels became available to cable viewers in Budapest the same year.

In 1997, TV2, a commercial channel was to be launched on the frequency where M2 used to be. However, MTV argued that by doing this, its audience would be given to the new channel as a present, which would mean severe disadvantage to both MTV and RTL Klub, the other debuting commercial channel. The authorities decided to leave the frequency empty, and allocate a new frequency to TV2. m2, however, was still moved to satellite and cable reception only, which, at the time was quite rare. The programming available on MTV2 was aimed at audiences which were most unlikely to receive the channel, so this meant a severe handicap for the company. Currently the company is recuperating from the decline earlier.

During the 1990s the MTV gradually lost its independence and became the voice of the all-time government, often accused of biased on commenting news . It is one of the most popular sources of news, and its background news programmes such as &quot;Az Este&quot; (The Evening) are both liked and internationally recognised. Its line-up of programmes feature long-running shows, such as the science news programme &quot;Delta&quot;, whilst other programmes like &quot;A Hét&quot; (The Week), a weekly review programme and &quot;Ablak&quot; (Window), an afternoon-long umbrella programme featuring general interest programmes, were both axed in recent years.

===The 2000s===
MTV is continuously underfinanced, just like many other public service channels around the globe, and is therefore struggling to produce programmes.
Whilst remaining entirely state-owned, the company was re-organised as a Closely Held Corporation. Funding changed significantly in 2002 with the end of the mandatory television licence fee levied on all household with a television set. Following this change, funding for MTV instead began to come from government grants and advertising.

The 2006 protests didn&#x27;t leave the headquarters unscathed; in fact, it was occupied by the rioters for a short time.

In 2000, M2 began broadcasting 24 hours a day, with repeats from its sister channel, m1 and from its archive library and from the Hungarian National Digital Archive and Film Institute (Magyar Nemzeti Digitális Archívum és Filmintézet).

===Present-day===
In 2011, most of the assets and employees of MTV were transferred to the newly created Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (, abbreviated MTVA), a government organization controlled by the Media Council of Hungary. Magyar Rádió and Duna Televízió were also made a part of the MTVA, which, together with MTV, unified all three public service broadcasters in Hungary for the first time. Additionally, the Hungarian news agency Magyar Távirati Iroda was merged into the MTVA and has since been responsible for the production of all news content aired on the three broadcasting organizations.

In 2015, the unification of all the public media organizations managed by the MTVA was strengthened when all four were merged into a single organization called Duna Media Service (). This nonprofit organization is the legal successor to the four formerly separate entities managed by the MTVA.

The creation of the MTVA and transfer of the public media organizations into it has been frequently criticised by non-governmental organizations as being politically motivated and intended to the lessen the independence of the public service media in Hungary. The government has stated that restructuring was necessary to improve the finances of the public media system and that all of the organizations within the MTVA retain editorial independence.

In 2012, MTV launched M3D, first 3D television in Hungary.

==MTV trademark suit==

Magyar Televízió, who has a trademark on the initials MTV registered with the Hungarian copyright office, sued the American MTV Music Television network for trademark infringement when MTV Music Television launched a Hungarian-language channel in 2007. The suit is still ongoing.

==Notable shows==
* &quot;On the Spot&quot;, documentary film series

==Location==

The Hungarian Television&#x27;s central building was located in the heart of Budapest on Szabadság tér (Freedom Square), across the Hungarian National Bank (Magyar Nemzeti Bank), the U.S. Embassy, and near to the Parliament. The building gave room to the Stock Exchange before the war. It is sold now and MTV has moved to the outskirts of Budapest to a purpose-built modern building. The old headquarters can be reached by a five minutes walk from Kossuth tér where Metro line 2 stops.

<text>Antaresia is a genus of pythons, nonvenomous snakes in the family Pythonidae. The genus is native to Australasia. The genus is known by the common name Children&#x27;s pythons, the name of the type species, &quot;Antaresia childreni&quot;. Gray named &quot;A. childreni&quot; in honour of his mentor, John George Children, who was a curator of the zoological collection at the British Museum around that time. It contains the smallest members of the Pythonidae. Four species and two subspecies are recognized, although they were all considered part of the same species until recently. A newly described form called the pygmy banded python may be a distinct species, but analysis has not yet been performed on this animal. The largest recorded examples of &quot;Antaresia&quot; species have all been males, suggesting males of the known species in this genus may compete for females. This behavior has never been witnessed in the wild, and has only been witnessed in captive specimens.

==Geographic range==
Species in the genus &quot;Antaresia&quot; are found in Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea, in arid and tropical regions.

==Species==

*) A taxon author in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Antaresia&quot;.
T) Type species.

==Taxonomy==
The generic name, &quot;Antaresia&quot;, is taken from the star Antares in the constellation Scorpius. The generic name was created in 1984 by Wells and Wellington in a revision of Children&#x27;s pythons, those previously described as a single species in the genus &quot;Liasis&quot;. Despite a petition to suppress the taxonomic work of these authors, it gained wide acceptance and publication in 1991.

Four species and two subspecies are currently recognized in the genus &quot;Antaresia&quot;, which is contained by the family Pythonidae; infraspecific ranks have also been described.

A subspecies, &quot;A. stimsoni orientalis&quot; was described by L.A. Smith (1985), but was not recognized as valid by Barker &amp; Barker (1994). It is now recognized as valid by ITIS, as well as A. stimsoni stimsoni.

==In captivity==
The members of the genus &quot;Antaresia&quot; are often kept as pets due to their small size, docile temperaments, strong feeding responses, resiliency and easy captive care. They are often seen as a good beginner species for keeping reptiles, particularly snakes. While not as popular or diverse in colors as ball pythons, these snakes can range in color from albino and leucistic to ebony, melanistic, and piebald color morphs to name a few. The varying coloration between individuals also makes them quite attractive to many who work with and breed exotic reptiles. In captivity, the members of this genus are very tolerant of differing humidity levels ranging from 20%-80% due to the wide range of habitats they occur in, and shedding problems that occur in captive animals are usually the result of temperatures being too high or low rather than problems with humidity. &quot;Antaresia&quot; species are also fairly easy to breed, though some individuals (mostly males) may refuse to eat when they are interested in mating.

<text>Aspidites is a genus of pythons endemic to Australia. The name can be translated as &quot;shield bearer&quot; and pertains to the symmetrically shaped head scales. Currently, two species are recognized.

==Description==
These snakes lack the heat-sensitive pits between the labial scales that most other python species have.

The head is slightly wider than the neck, and the eyes are small, with a vertically elliptic pupils.

==Distribution and habitat==
They are found in Australia except in the south of the country.

==Behavior==
Both species are nocturnal, and terrestrial.

==Reproduction==
Oviparous, the females stay with their eggs until they hatch.

==Species==
T) Type species.

==Taxonomy==
Two new subspecies, &quot;A. ramsayi panoptes&quot;, the western woma python, and &quot;A. r. richardjonesii&quot;, the desert woma python, were described by Hoser (2001). However, these descriptions are questionable, as they do not include proper diagnoses and seem to be based only on distribution.

<text>Leiopython is a genus of snakes in the family Pythonidae.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Leiopython&quot; contains the following species:
*&quot;L. albertisii&quot; – D&#x27;Albertis&#x27; python, northern white-lipped python 
*&quot;L. fredparkeri&quot; – Karimui Basin white-lipped python, southern white-lipped python 
*&quot;L. biakensis&quot; – Biak white-lipped python

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Leiopython&quot;.

==Description==
Female adults of the northern white-lipped python (&quot;L. albertisii)&quot; grow to an average of about 213 cm (6–7 ft) in total length (including tail), whereas the southern white-lipped python (&quot;L. fredparkeri)&quot; can reach up to in total length. Both species are patternless, except the northern white-lipped python has some light markings on its postoculars, which are absent in the southern whitelip python.

==Behavior==
Although mostly terrestrial, snakes of the genus &quot;Leiopython&quot; can and are known to occasionally climb. White-lipped pythons are reportedly aggressive, though this is reduced in those born and raised in captivity. These snakes have also been observed to regularly regurgitate fur balls from their prey.

<text>A town council, city council or municipal council is a form of local government for small municipalities.
Usage of the term varies under different jurisdictions.

==Republic of Ireland==

In 2002, 49 urban district councils and 26 town commissioners were redesignated as 75 town councils as a tier of local government below the county council. Five additional local authorities retained the higher status as borough councils. All 80 second-tier municipal authorities were abolished under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, with effect at the 2014 Irish local elections.

==Belize==
There are currently seven town councils in Belize. Each town council consists of a mayor and a number of councillors, who are directly elected in municipal elections every three years. Town councils in Belize are responsible for a range of functions, including street maintenance and lighting, drainage, refuse collection, public cemeteries, infrastructure, parks and playgrounds.

==England and Wales==

In England, since the Local Government Act 1972, &quot;town council&quot; is the specific name for a civil parish council which has declared itself by resolution to be a town council. If another type of local council, such as a district authority, covers a single town (such as Luton or Stevenage) then the council is often a &#x27;borough council&#x27;: borough status is however conferred at the discretion of the Crown.

Civil parishes are the most local level in the local government system. The higher levels are district, unitary and county. However town councils are not subordinate in democratic accountability to those higher levels, but to the electorate of their civil parish area.

The chair of a town council is entitled to be styled as &quot;town mayor&quot;. This term contrasts with simply &quot;mayor&quot;, which means the mayor of a borough or a city. However, this is often abbreviated simply to mayor, especially where the town was historically a borough or city, such as Lewes or Ely. In Scotland, the term &#x27;provost&#x27; is commonly used to designate the leader of the town council.

Historically the term &#x27;town council&#x27; was used for the governing body of a municipal borough until the 1972 Act.

In Wales, where the lowest tier of local government is known as a community, the Community Council may unilaterally declare itself to be a Town Council, but this has the same status as a Community Council.

==Canada==

===Ontario===
Township councils in Ontario play a similar role as city councils in cities for smaller or low tier municipalities. Directly elected every four years, the number of councillors vary depending on the size of their municipalities. The councillors powers and responsibilities are governed by the &quot;Municipal Act&quot;.

===Manitoba===
Manitoba town council members serve primarily as a policy and direction board for the community. They consist of five to seven members with the head of council being the mayor or reeve.

==United States==

===Indiana===
Indiana town council members serve as both the executive and legislative branches for small communities incorporated as towns within the state. They consist of three or five members, depending upon the town&#x27;s population.

Unlike some states, Indiana councilmembers must declare a political party affiliation, if any, when they file to run for office. Upon election in November, they are sworn in before 1 January of the following year, where they serve a four-year term. There are no state term limits affecting how many times a candidate may run for re-election to office.

The first meeting after an election, members of the town council hold an organising meeting, where they elect a president to set future agendas and act as an official spokesman for the town or as liaison between the town and state and county government.

Indiana town councils work in conjunction with an elected town clerk, who manages the day-to-day business of the municipal government. As an elected official, the town clerk is solely executive in function and operates independently of the town council. But the council has final say on budgets which clerks depend upon to operate.

In addition to a clerk, the council can authorise the hiring of other staff to run the operations of government, including law enforcement officers, utility workers, park and recreation employees and town managers. These employees serve at the pleasure of the council.

===Massachusetts===
Town councils in Massachusetts are essentially city councils in towns which have adopted a city form of government but prefer to retain the &quot;town of&quot; in their names. In several communities which have adopted such a government, the official name of the community is &quot;The City known as the Town of...&quot; The legislative body of a legal town in Massachusetts is a town meeting; the executive board is a board of selectmen. In addition to having the structure of a city with a mayor and council, cities in Massachusetts can enact ordinances, while towns may adopt by-laws, which are subject to the approval of the Attorney General. City ordinances are presumed to be legal unless challenged and set aside in court. &quot;See&quot; Massachusetts Government.

===Michigan===
In Michigan, there are 257 incorporated villages that are governed by village councils, which is a form of weak–mayor administration. Michigan does not use &quot;town&quot; as a defined municipality, and villages are the lowest-level form of incorporated municipality. Villages are distinct from cities in that they share certain duties with their surrounding township and are not completely autonomous. Guidelines for village governments are defined in the General Law Village Act (Act 3) of 1895. Village councils consist of elected officials, including a village president, trustees, clerk, and treasurer.

===New Hampshire===
In New Hampshire, the Town Council is an elected body which serves as the legislative and executive body of the town. The town is governed by a charter, which is allowed under the home rule provision of the New Hampshire Constitution (Pt I, Art. 39) and Title III of the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated. The charter for a Town Council must meet the following requirements of RSA 49-D:3 I. (a) – (e) and all other applicable laws. The basic notion of home rule in New Hampshire is that local communities are not allowed to supersede the authority specifically granted to them by the state.

====Official Ballot Town Council====
The Official Ballot Town Council is a variant form of the Town Council. In the Official Ballot form of government, the town council is vested with the limited authority to vote on all matters not voted on by official ballot. The authority and restrictions on the Official Ballot town council is the same as the Town Council, except with respect to those matters specified to be voted on by official ballot. Also, the council decides what is placed on the ballot, not the registered voters.

The charter of the Official Ballot Town Council is required by law to specify specifically:
*Which budgetary items to be included on the official ballot; and
*A finalisation process for the annual budget; and
*Process for public hearings, debate, discussion and amendment of questions to be placed on the official ballot; and
*Procedures for the transfer of funds among various departments, funds, accounts and agencies as may be necessary during the year; and
*Applicability of the official ballot procedure to special elections

The charter also must specify whether a or majority vote is required to approve bonds or notes, with the default being .

==Palestinian Authority==

The Palestinian National Authority established village councils to serve as local administrations and service providers for Palestinian villages and small towns. Village councils are also referred to as D-level municipalities.

==Singapore==

In Singapore, town councils are in charge of maintaining the common areas of Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats and estates, such as the common corridors, void decks, lifts, water tanks, external lighting and the open spaces surrounding the estates. They are regulated under the .

The rationale was to delegate the duties of estate management to the members of parliament in addition to their existing responsibilities. They would also gain management experience and be accountable to their district&#x27;s resident voters.

Town councils boundaries are drawn based on electoral districts boundaries. A town council area can consist of a Group Representation Constituency (GRC), a Single Member Constituency (SMC), or a collection of neighbouring GRCs and SMCs controlled by the same political party. The Members of Parliament head the town councils of their constituencies. Town councils boundaries do not correspond to new town boundaries; different parts of the same HDB town may be managed by different town councils.

==Others==
*Community council, the lowest tier of local government in England, Scotland and Wales
*Rural Council, a former name for Sangguniang Barangay, Philippines
*Rural community council, Great Britain
*Selsoviet, lowest level of administrative division in rural areas in the Soviet Union, preserved as a third tier of administrative-territorial division throughout Ukraine, Belarus and some parts of Russia
*Rural Council (Ukraine)
*Rural municipality (Nepal) (Gaunpalika)

<text>New York, often called New York City or NYC, is the most populous city in the United States, located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world&#x27;s largest natural harbors. The city comprises five boroughs, each coextensive with a respective county. The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the United States by both population and urban area. New York is a global center of finance and commerce, culture, technology, entertainment and media, academics and scientific output, the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, international diplomacy.
With an estimated population in 2023 of 8,258,035 distributed over , the city is the most densely populated major city in the United States. New York City has more than double the population of Los Angeles, the nation&#x27;s second-most populous city. With more than 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York City is one of the world&#x27;s most populous megacities. The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York City, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. In 2021, the city was home to nearly 3.1 million residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world.
New York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam and a trading post founded on Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists around 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was temporarily renamed New York after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York, before being permanently renamed New York in November 1674. Following independence from Great Britain, the city was the national capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. The modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island.
Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world&#x27;s premier financial and fintech center and the most economically powerful city in the world. , the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion. The New York metropolitan area&#x27;s economy is larger than all but nine countries in the world. Despite having a 24/7 rapid transit system, New York also leads the world in urban automobile traffic congestion. The city is home to the world&#x27;s two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. New York City is an established safe haven for global investors. , New York City is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates and has by a wide margin the highest residential rents of any city in the nation; and Fifth Avenue is the most expensive shopping street in the world. New York City is home by a significant margin to the highest number of billionaires, individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than US$30 million), and millionaires of any city in the world.

==Etymology==

In 1664, New York was named in honor of the Duke of York (later King James II of England). James&#x27;s elder brother, King Charles II, appointed him proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when the Kingdom of England seized it from Dutch control.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

In the pre-Columbian era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquians, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.

The first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano. He claimed the area for France and named it &quot;Nouvelle Angoulême&quot; (New Angoulême). A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named (&#x27;Saint Anthony&#x27;s River&#x27;).

In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company. He sailed up what the Dutch called North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the &quot;Mauritius&quot; after Maurice, Prince of Orange.

Hudson claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called (&#x27;New Netherland&#x27;). The first non–Native American inhabitant of what became New York City was Juan Rodriguez, a merchant from Santo Domingo who arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch.

=== Dutch rule ===

A permanent European presence near New York Harbor was established in 1624, making New York the 12th-oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States, with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam, later called &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot; (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island.

The colony of New Amsterdam extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day Wall Street, where a wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and English raids. In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the &quot;Canarsie&quot;, a small Lenape band, for &quot;the value of 60 guilders&quot; (about $900 in 2018). A frequently told but disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.

Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly. To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (&quot;patroons&quot;, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded land, local political autonomy, and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.

Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639–1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).

In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000. Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order; however, he earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups from establishing houses of worship.

=== English rule ===

In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls, without bloodshed. The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.

In 1667, during negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda after the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the victorious Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now Suriname, which they had gained from the English, and in return the English kept New Amsterdam. The settlement was promptly renamed &quot;New York&quot; after the Duke of York (the future King James II and VII). The duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley.

On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Anthony Colve of the Dutch navy seized New York at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it &quot;New Orange&quot; after William III, the Prince of Orange. The Dutch soon returned the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.

Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between 1660 and 1670. By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200. New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population in 1702 alone.

In the early 18th century, New York grew in importance as a trading port while as a part of the colony of New York. It became a center of slavery, with 42% of households enslaving Africans by 1730. Most were domestic slaves; others were hired out as labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York&#x27;s economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banking and shipping industries trading with the American South. During construction in Foley Square in the 1990s, the African Burying Ground was discovered; the cemetery included 10,000 to 20,000 graves of colonial-era Africans, some enslaved and some free.

The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish freedom of the press in North America. In 1754, Columbia University was founded.

=== American Revolution ===
The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty organization emerged in the city and skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there. The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within modern-day Brooklyn. A British rout of the Continental Army at the Battle of Fort Washington in November 1776 eliminated the last American stronghold in Manhattan, causing George Washington and his forces to retreat across the Hudson River to New Jersey, pursued by British forces.

After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom promised by the Crown, with as many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation, the largest such community on the continent. When the British forces evacuated New York at the close of the war in 1783, they transported thousands of freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia, England, and the Caribbean.

The attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York destroyed nearly 500 buildings, about a quarter of the structures in the city, including Trinity Church.

=== Post-revolutionary period and early 19th century ===
In January 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital. New York was the last capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation and the first under the Constitution. As the capital, New York City hosted the inauguration of the first President, George Washington, and the first Congress, at Federal Hall on Wall Street. Congress drafted the Bill of Rights there. The Supreme Court held its first organizational sessions in New York in 1790.

In 1790, for the first time, New York City surpassed Philadelphia as the nation&#x27;s largest city. At the end of 1790, the national capital was moved to Philadelphia.

During the 19th century, New York City&#x27;s population grew from 60,000 to 3.43 million. Under New York State&#x27;s gradual emancipation act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties. Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-Black population gradually developed in Manhattan. The New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate Black children. It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state. Free Blacks struggled with discrimination and interracial abolitionist activism continued. New York City&#x27;s population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 (10,886 of whom were Black and of which 518 were enslaved) to 312,710 by 1840 (16,358 of whom were Black).
Also in the 19th century, the city was transformed by both commercial and residential development relating to its status as a national and international trading center, as well as by European immigration, respectively. The city adopted the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes. Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants. In 1831, New York University was founded.

Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Members of the business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.

The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, of whom more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, representing over a quarter of the city&#x27;s population. Extensive immigration from the German provinces meant that Germans comprised another 25% of New York&#x27;s population by 1860.

=== American Civil War ===
Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city&#x27;s ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.

The draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York&#x27;s elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and Black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground. At least 120 people were killed. Eleven Black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of Blacks to flee. The Black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865. The White working class had established dominance. It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.

=== Late 19th and early 20th century ===

In 1886, the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was dedicated in New York Harbor. The statue welcomed 14 million immigrants as they arrived via Ellis Island by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the United States and American ideals of liberty and peace.

In 1898, the City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens. The opening of the New York City Subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.

In 1904, the steamship &quot;General Slocum&quot; caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people. In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city&#x27;s worst industrial disaster, killed 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.

New York&#x27;s non-White population was 36,620 in 1890. New York City was a prime destination in the early 20th century for Blacks during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition. The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height.

New York City became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed 10 million in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity. The Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.

Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County, with Wall Street leading America&#x27;s place as the world&#x27;s dominant economic power. The United Nations headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York&#x27;s global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York&#x27;s displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.

=== Late 20th and early 21st centuries ===

In 1969, the Stonewall riots were a series of violent protests by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. They are widely considered to be the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights. Wayne R. Dynes, author of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Homosexuality&quot;, wrote that drag queens were the only &quot;transgender folks around&quot; during the Stonewall riots. The transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality.
In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates. Growing fiscal deficits in 1975 led the city to appeal to the federal government for financial aid; President Gerald Ford gave a speech denying the request, which was paraphrased on the front page of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; as &quot;FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD&quot;. The Municipal Assistance Corporation was formed and granted oversight authority over the city&#x27;s finances. While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city&#x27;s economic health in the 1980s, New York&#x27;s crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.

New York City&#x27;s population exceeded 8 million for the first time in the 2000 census; further records were set in the 2010 and 2020 censuses. Important new economic sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged.

The year 2000 was celebrated with fanfare in Times Square. New York City suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Two of the four hijacked airliners were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, resulting in the collapse of both buildings and the deaths of 2,753 people, including 343 first responders from the New York City Fire Department and 71 law enforcement officers.

The area was rebuilt with a new World Trade Center, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, and other new buildings and infrastructure, including the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city&#x27;s third-largest hub. The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the world&#x27;s seventh-tallest building by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic , a reference to the year of American independence.

The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.

New York City was heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, including flooding that led to the days-long shutdown of the subway system, and flooding of all East River subway tunnels and of all road tunnels entering Manhattan except the Lincoln Tunnel. The New York Stock Exchange closed for two days due to weather for the first time since the Great Blizzard of 1888. At least 43 people died in New York City as a result of Sandy, and the economic losses in New York City were estimated to be roughly $19 billion. The disaster spawned long-term efforts towards infrastructural projects to counter climate change and rising seas, with $15 billion in federal funding received through 2022 towards those resiliency efforts.

In March 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in the city was confirmed. With its population density and extensive exposure to global travelers, the city rapidly replaced Wuhan, China as the global epicenter of the pandemic during the early phase, straining the city&#x27;s healthcare infrastructure. Through March 2023, New York City recorded more than 80,000 deaths from COVID-19-related complications.

== Geography ==
New York City lies in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston. Its location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city become a significant trading port. Most of the city is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.

During the Wisconsin glaciation, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City area was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet. The erosive forward movement of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation of what is now Long Island and Staten Island. That action left bedrock at a relatively shallow depth, providing a solid foundation for most of Manhattan&#x27;s skyscrapers.

The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary. The Hudson River separates the city from New Jersey. The East River—a tidal strait—flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely freshwater river in the city.

The city&#x27;s land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in Manhattan.

The city&#x27;s total area is . of the city is land and of it is water. The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at above sea level, is the highest point on the eastern seaboard south of Maine. The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.

=== Boroughs ===

 is sometimes referred to collectively as the &quot;Five Boroughs&quot;. Each borough is coextensive with a respective county of New York State, making New York City one of the U.S. municipalities in multiple counties.

Manhattan (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough. It is home to Central Park and most of the city&#x27;s skyscrapers, and is sometimes locally known as &quot;The City&quot;. Manhattan&#x27;s population density of in 2022 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city. Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial center of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the United Nations headquarters, Wall Street, and a number of important universities. The borough is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world.

Brooklyn (Kings County), on the western tip of Long Island, is the city&#x27;s most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage.

New York has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the Dutch Colonial Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, the oldest section of which dates to 1656, to the modern One World Trade Center, the skyscraper at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and the most expensive office tower in the world by construction cost.

Manhattan&#x27;s skyline, with its many skyscrapers, has been recognized as an iconic symbol of the city, and the city has been home to several of the tallest buildings in the world. , New York City had 6,455 high-rise buildings, the third most in the world after Hong Kong and Seoul.

The character of New York&#x27;s large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930. Stone and brick became the city&#x27;s building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835.

In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In neighborhoods such as Riverdale (in the Bronx), Ditmas Park (in Brooklyn), and Douglaston (in Queens), large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian.
=== Arts ===

Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is home to numerous influential arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and New York City Ballet, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Alice Tully Hall. The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute is in Union Square, and Tisch School of the Arts is based at New York University, while Central Park SummerStage presents free concerts in Central Park.

New York City has more than 2,000 arts and cultural organizations and more than 500 art galleries. The city government funds the arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts. The city is also home to hundreds of cultural institutions and historic sites. Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 105th streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in the upper portion of Carnegie Hill.

Nine museums occupy this section of Fifth Avenue, making it one of the densest displays of high culture in the world. Its art museums include the Guggenheim, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Neue Galerie New York, and The Africa Center. In addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival, held each year in June, to promote the museums and increase visitation. Many of the world&#x27;s most lucrative art auctions are held in New York City.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art is the largest art museum in the Americas. In 2022, it welcomed 3.2 million visitors, ranking it the third-most visited museum in the country, and eighth-most visited art museum in the world. Its permanent collection contains more than two million works across 17 curatorial departments, and includes works of art from classical antiquity and ancient Egypt; paintings and sculptures from nearly all the European masters; and an extensive collection of American and modern art. The Met maintains extensive holdings of African, Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic art.

=== Cuisine ===


New York City&#x27;s food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city&#x27;s long immigrant history. Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants from those regions, brought New York-style bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes, and delicatessens (delis) to the city. Italian immigrants brought New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine into the city, while Jewish immigrants and Irish immigrants brought pastrami and corned beef, respectively. Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses are ubiquitous throughout the city. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs examples of modern New York street food. The city is home to &quot;nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world&quot;, according to Michelin. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene assigns letter grades to the city&#x27;s restaurants based on inspection results. As of 2019, there were 27,043 restaurants in the city, up from 24,865 in 2017. The Queens Night Market in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park attracts more than ten thousand people nightly to sample food from more than 85 countries.

=== Fashion ===

New York City is a global fashion capital, and the fashion industry employs 4.6% of the city&#x27;s private workforce. New York Fashion Week (NYFW) is a high-profile semiannual event featuring models displaying the latest wardrobes created by fashion designers worldwide in advance of these fashions proceeding to the marketplace.

NYFW sets the tone for the global fashion industry. New York&#x27;s fashion district encompasses roughly 30 city blocks in Midtown Manhattan, clustered around a stretch of Seventh Avenue nicknamed &quot;Fashion Avenue&quot;. New York&#x27;s fashion calendar also includes Couture Fashion Week to showcase haute couture styles. The Met Gala is often described as &quot;Fashion&#x27;s biggest night&quot;.

=== Parades ===
New York City is well known for its street parades, the majority in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues. The annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade is the world&#x27;s largest parade, beginning alongside Central Park and proceeding southward to the flagship Macy&#x27;s Herald Square store; the parade is viewed on telecasts worldwide and draws millions of spectators in person. Other notable parades including the annual New York City St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade in March, the NYC LGBT Pride March in June, the LGBT-inspired Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in October, and numerous parades commemorating the independence days of many nations. Ticker-tape parades celebrating championships won by sports teams as well as other accomplishments march northward along the Canyon of Heroes on Broadway from Bowling Green to City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan.

There are 127 Nobel laureates with roots in local institutions .

=== Health ===

New York City is a center for healthcare and medical training, with employment of over 750,000 in the city&#x27;s health care sector. Private hospitals in New York City include the Hospital for Special Surgery, Lenox Hill Hospital, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, and NYU Langone Health. Medical schools include SUNY Downstate College of Medicine in Brooklyn, Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, and CUNY School of Medicine, Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Weill Cornell Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and New York University School of Medicine in Manhattan.

NYC Health + Hospitals (HHC) is a public-benefit corporation established in 1969 which operates the city&#x27;s public hospitals and a network of outpatient clinics. , HHC is the largest American municipal healthcare system with $10.9 billion in annual revenues. HHC serves 1.4 million patients, including more than 475,000 uninsured city residents. HHC operates eleven acute-care hospitals, four skilled nursing facilities, six diagnostic and treatment centers, and more than 70 community-based primary care sites, serving primarily the city&#x27;s poor and working-class residents. HHC&#x27;s MetroPlus Health Plan is one of New York City&#x27;s largest providers of government-sponsored health insurance, enrolling 670,000 city residents as of June 2022.

HHC&#x27;s facilities annually provides service to millions of New Yorkers, interpreted in more than 190 languages. The best-known hospital in the HHC system is Bellevue Hospital, the oldest public hospital in the United States, established in 1736. Bellevue is the designated hospital for treatment of the president and other world leaders should they require care while in New York City.

The city banned smoking in most parts of restaurants in 1995 and prohibited smoking in bars, restaurants and places of public employment in 2003. Pharmacies are banned from selling smoked and vaped products in New York State.

New York City enforces a right-to-shelter law guaranteeing shelter to anyone who needs it, regardless of their immigration, socioeconomic, or housing status, which entails providing adequate shelter and food. As a result, while New York has the highest total homeless population of American cities, only 5% were unsheltered by the city, representing a significantly lower percentage of outdoor homelessness than in other cities. As of 2023, there were 92,824 homeless people sleeping nightly in the shelter system.

=== Public safety ===

The New York Police Department (NYPD) is the largest police force in the United States, with more than 36,000 sworn officers. Members of the NYPD are frequently referred to by politicians, the media, and their own police cars by the nickname, &quot;New York&#x27;s Finest&quot;.

The city saw a spike in crime in the 1970s through 1990s. Crime overall has trended downward in New York City since the 1990s; violent crime decreased more than 75% from 1993 to 2005, and continued decreasing during periods when the nation as a whole saw increases. The NYPD&#x27;s stop-and-frisk program was declared unconstitutional in 2013 as a &quot;policy of indirect racial profiling&quot; of Black and Mixed residents, although claims of disparate impact continued in subsequent years. The stop-and-frisk program had been widely credited as being behind the decline in crime, though rates continued dropping in the years after the program ended.

The city set a record high of 2,245 murders in 1990 and hit a near-70-year record low of 289 in 2018. The number of murders and the rate of 3.3 per 100,000 residents in 2017 was the lowest since 1951. New York City recorded 386 murders in 2023, a decline of 12% from the previous year. New York City had one of the lowest homicide rates among the ten largest U.S. cities at 5.5 per 100,000 residents in 2021.

New York City has stricter gun laws than most other cities in the United States—a license to own any firearm is required, and the NY SAFE Act of 2013 banned assault weapons. New York State had the fifth-lowest gun death rate of the states in 2020.

Organized crime has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points neighborhood in the 1820s, followed by the Tongs in the same neighborhood, which ultimately evolved into Chinatown, Manhattan. The 20th century saw a rise in the Mafia, dominated by the Five Families, as well as in gangs, including the Black Spades. The Mafia and gang presence has declined in the city in the 21st century.

The Fire Department of New York (FDNY) provides fire protection, technical rescue, primary response to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards, and emergency medical services. FDNY faces multifaceted firefighting challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to building types that range from wood-frame single family homes to high-rise structures, the FDNY responds to fires that occur in the New York City Subway. Secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires, also present challenges. The FDNY is headquartered at 9 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn, and the FDNY Fire Academy is on Randalls Island.

== Transportation ==
=== Rapid transit ===
Mass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the country, and two-thirds of the nation&#x27;s rail riders live in the New York City metropolitan area.

==== Buses ====
New York City&#x27;s public bus fleet runs 24/7 and is the largest in North America. The New York City bus system serves the most passengers of any city in the nation: In 2022, MTA New York City Transit&#x27;s buses served 483.5 million trips, while MTA Regional Bus Operations handled 100.3 million trips.

The Port Authority Bus Terminal is the city&#x27;s main intercity bus terminal and the world&#x27;s busiest bus station, serving 250,000 passengers on 7,000 buses each workday in a building opened in 1950 that was designed to accommodate 60,000 daily passengers. A 2021 plan announced by the Port Authority would spend $10 billion to expand capacity and modernize the facility. In 2024, the Port Authority announced plans for a new terminal that would feature a glass atrium at a new main entrance on 41st Street.

==== Rail ====


The New York City Subway system is the largest rapid transit system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with , and by length of routes. Nearly all of New York&#x27;s subway system is open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to most subway systems. The New York City Subway is the busiest metropolitan rail transit system in the Western Hemisphere, with 1.70 billion passenger rides in 2019.

Public transport is widely used in New York City. 54.6% of New Yorkers commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit. This is in contrast to the rest of the country, where 91% of commuters travel in automobiles to their workplace. According to the New York City Comptroller, workers in the New York City area spend an average of 6hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities. New York is the only American city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car. Due to their high usage of mass transit, New Yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving $19 billion annually on transportation compared to other urban Americans.

New York City&#x27;s commuter rail network is the largest in North America. The rail network, connecting New York City to its suburbs, consists of the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and New Jersey Transit. The combined systems converge at Grand Central Terminal and New York Penn Station and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines. The elevated AirTrain JFK in Queens connects JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road. For inter-city rail, New York City is served by Amtrak, whose busiest station by a significant margin is Penn Station on the West Side of Manhattan, from which Amtrak provides connections to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. along the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance train service to other North American cities.

The Staten Island Railway rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day, with access to Manhattan from the St. George Terminal via the Staten Island Ferry. The PATH train links Midtown and Lower Manhattan with Hoboken Terminal and Newark Penn Station in New Jersey, and then those stations with the World Trade Center Oculus across the Hudson River. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day, meaning three of the five American rapid transit systems which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York. Grand Central Terminal is the world&#x27;s largest train station by number of rail platforms and acres occupied.

Multibillion-dollar heavy rail transit projects under construction in New York City include the Second Avenue Subway.

=== Air ===

New York&#x27;s airspace is the busiest in the United States and one of the world&#x27;s busiest air corridors. The three busiest airports in the New York metropolitan area are John F. Kennedy International Airport (with 55.3 million passengers), Newark Liberty International Airport (43.6 million) and LaGuardia Airport (29.0 million); 127.9 million travelers used these three airports in 2022. JFK and Newark Liberty were the busiest and fourth-busiest U.S. gateways for international air passengers, respectively, in 2023. , JFK was the busiest airport for international passengers in North America.

Described in 2014 by then-Vice President Joe Biden as the kind of airport travelers would see in &quot;some third world country&quot;, LaGuardia Airport has undergone an $8 billion project with federal and state support that has replaced its aging facilities with modern terminals and roadways. Plans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport, Stewart International Airport, near Newburgh, New York, by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Other commercial airports in or serving the New York metropolitan area include Long Island MacArthur Airport, Trenton–Mercer Airport and Westchester County Airport. The primary general aviation airport serving the area is Teterboro Airport.

=== Ferries, taxis and trams===


The Staten Island Ferry is the world&#x27;s busiest ferry, carrying more than 23 million passengers from July 2015 through June 2016 on a route between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan and running 24/7. Other ferry systems shuttle commuters between Manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area. NYC Ferry, a NYCEDC initiative with routes planned to travel to all five boroughs, was launched in 2017.

Identified by their color and taxi medallion, the city&#x27;s 13,587 yellow taxicabs are the only vehicles allowed to pick up riders making street hails throughout the city. Apple green-colored boro taxis can pick up street hails in Upper Manhattan and the four outer boroughs. Long dominated by yellow taxis, high-volume for-hire vehicles from Uber and Lyft have provided the most trips in the city since December 2016, when the for-hire vehicles and cabs each had about 10.5 million trips. By October 2023, the 78,000 vehicles-for-hire combined for 20.3 million trips, while 3.5 million trips were in yellow taxis.

The Roosevelt Island Tramway, an aerial tramway that began operation in 1976, transports 2 million passengers per year the between Roosevelt Island and 59th Street and Second Avenue on Manhattan Island.

=== Cycling network ===

New York City has mixed cycling conditions which include urban density, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with stop-and-go traffic, and many pedestrians. The city&#x27;s large cycling population includes utility cyclists, such as delivery and messenger services; recreational cycling clubs; and an increasing number of commuters. Cycling is increasingly popular in New York City; in 2022 there were approximately 61,200 people who commuted daily using a bicycle and 610,000 daily bike trips, both nearly doubling over the previous decade. , New York City had of bike lanes, including of segregated or &quot;protected&quot; bike lanes citywide.

=== Streets and highways ===

Streets are also a defining feature of the city. New York has been found to lead the world in urban automobile traffic congestion. The Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 greatly influenced its physical development. New York City has an extensive web of freeways and parkways, which link the city&#x27;s boroughs to each other and to North Jersey, Westchester County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut through bridges and tunnels. Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who commute into Manhattan, it is common for motorists to be stranded for hours in dense traffic congestion that is a daily occurrence, particularly during rush hour. Congestion pricing in New York City was activated in January 2025, applying to most motor vehicular traffic using the area of Manhattan south of 60th Street, in an effort to encourage commuters to use rapid transit instead.
Unlike the rest of the country, New York State prohibits turns on red lights in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City, therefore, all turns on red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present.

=== Bridges and tunnels ===
The boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are located on islands with the same names, while Queens and Brooklyn are at the west end of the larger Long Island, and the Bronx is on New York State&#x27;s mainland. Manhattan Island is linked to the outer boroughs and to New Jersey by an extensive network of bridges and tunnels. The 14-lane George Washington Bridge, connecting Manhattan to New Jersey across the Hudson River, is the world&#x27;s busiest motor vehicle bridge. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, spanning the Narrows between Brooklyn and Staten Island, is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world&#x27;s longest. The Brooklyn Bridge, with its stone neo-Gothic suspension towers, is an icon of the city; opened in 1883, it was the first steel-wire suspension bridge and was the longest suspension bridge in the world until 1903. The Queensboro Bridge &quot;was the longest cantilever span in North America&quot; from 1909 to 1917. The Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1909, &quot;is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges&quot;, and its design &quot;served as the model for the major long-span suspension bridges&quot; of the early 20th century. The Throgs Neck Bridge and Whitestone Bridge connect Queens and the Bronx, while the Triborough Bridge connects Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx.
The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world. The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan&#x27;s piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927. The Queens–Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940. The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel (officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel) is the longest continuous underwater vehicular tunnel in North America and runs underneath Battery Park, connecting the Financial District, Manhattan, to Red Hook, Brooklyn.

== Government and politics ==
=== Government ===

New York City is a metropolitan municipality with a strong mayor–council form of government. The city government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services.

The City Council is a unicameral body of 51 council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries. Each term for the mayor and council members lasts four years and has a two consecutive-term limit, (reset after a four-year break). The &quot;New York City Administrative Code&quot;, the &quot;New York City Rules&quot;, and &quot;The City Record&quot; are the code of local laws, compilation of regulations, and official journal, respectively.

Each borough is coextensive with a judicial district of the state Unified Court System, of which the Criminal Court and the Civil Court are the local courts, while the New York Supreme Court conducts major trials and appeals. Manhattan hosts the First Department of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, while Brooklyn hosts the Second Department. There are several extrajudicial administrative courts, which are executive agencies and not part of the state Unified Court System.

New York City is divided between, and is host to the main branches of, two different U.S. district courts: the District Court for the Southern District of New York, whose main courthouse is on Foley Square in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes Manhattan and the Bronx; and the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and U.S. Court of International Trade are also based on Foley Square.

=== Politics ===
The city&#x27;s mayor is Eric Adams, a Democrat who was elected in 2021. The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of November 2023, 67% of active registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10.2% are Republicans. New York City has not been carried by a Republican presidential candidate since 1924, and no Republican candidate for statewide office has won all five boroughs since the city was incorporated in 1898. In redistricting following the 2020 census, 14 of New York&#x27;s 26 congressional districts include portions of New York City.

New York City is a significant source of political fundraising. The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends $11.4 billion more than it receives back). City residents and businesses also sent an additional $4.1 billion in the 2009–2010 fiscal year to the state than the city received in return.

=== International relations ===

In 2006, the sister city program was restructured as &quot;New York City Global Partners&quot;. New York&#x27;s &quot;historic sister cities&quot; are denoted below by the year they joined New York City&#x27;s partnership network.

<text>Riget (English title: The Kingdom) is a Danish absurdist supernatural horror miniseries trilogy created by Lars von Trier and Tómas Gislason. Set in the neurosurgical ward of Copenhagen&#x27;s Rigshospitalet (, nicknamed &quot;Riget&quot;, ), each episode of the show follows the hospital&#x27;s eccentric staff and patients as they encounter bizarre and sometimes supernatural phenomena. The series is notable for its wry humor, its muted sepia colour scheme, and the appearance of a chorus of dishwashers with Down syndrome, who discuss in intimate detail the strange occurrences in the hospital. The main theme&#x27;s song was written by von Trier himself.

The first series of four episodes premiered from DR in November to December 1994, and was followed by a second series, Riget II, which aired in November 1997. A belated third and final series of five episodes directed by von Trier and written by von Trier with Niels Vørsel, entitled Exodus, began filming in 2021, was screened out of competition at the Venice Film Festival and at the Serial Killer festival in September 2022, and premiered on Nordic streaming platform Viaplay with the first two episodes on October 9. The series premiered in select regions between November 27 and December 25 on streaming platform MUBI.

Von Trier has credited David Lynch&#x27;s 1990 television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and the 1965 French miniseries &quot;Belphegor&quot; as inspirations for the series. &quot;The Kingdom&quot; itself inspired an American series, &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot;, developed by novelist Stephen King; the American version aired on ABC between March and July 2004, and was cancelled after a single season.

== Plot synopsis ==

Each episode of all three series opens with the same prologue, detailing how the hospital, Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, was built on the site of the &quot;bleaching ponds&quot;, which recur in the name of the street of the hospital&#x27;s official address, Blegdamsvej, although the exact significance of the reference is never explicitly discussed in the series.

The show begins with the admission of a spiritualist patient, Sigrid Drusse (Kirsten Rolffes), who hears the sound of a girl crying in the elevator shaft. Upon investigation, Drusse discovers that the girl had died decades earlier, having been killed by her father to hide her illegitimacy. In order to put the spirit to rest, Drusse searches for the girl&#x27;s body and ultimately finds it preserved in a specimen jar in the office of the hospital&#x27;s professor of pathology, Professor Bondo (Baard Owe).

Meanwhile, neurosurgeon Stig Helmer (Ernst-Hugo Järegård), a recent appointee from Sweden to the neurosurgery department, tries to cover up his responsibility for a botched operation which left a young girl in a persistent vegetative state.

Pathologist Dr. Palle Bondo (Baard Owe) attempts to convince the family of a man dying from liver cancer to donate his liver to the hospital for Bondo&#x27;s research. (In fact, Bondo wants it as a trophy, as it is the second largest hepatosarcoma ever recorded.) When denied, Bondo has the cancerous liver transplanted into his own body (as the patient signed an organ donor form), so that the cancer will become his personal property and can be kept within the hospital.

Amongst other plotlines, a young medical student becomes attracted to the nurse in charge of the sleep research laboratory, a ghostly ambulance appears and disappears every night, a junior doctor runs a black market in medical supplies, and a neurosurgeon discovers that she was impregnated by a ghost and that the baby in her womb is developing abnormally rapidly. In every episode, two dishwashers (each with Down syndrome) in the cellar discuss the strange happenings at Riget, and Helmer screams his famous catchphrase: &quot;Danskjävlar!&quot; (subtitled as &quot;Danish scum&quot;, but literally &quot;Danish devils&quot;).

In the third series, &quot;Exodus&quot;, sleepwalker Karen Svensson finds herself at Rigshospitalet, investigating the fallout of the fatal power outage at the end of the second series. &quot;Exodus&quot; also introduces Dr. Helmer, Jr. (Mikael Persbrandt), the neurotic son of the late Stig Helmer, and a new addition to the staff of Riget. Helmer Jr. is threatened with a lawsuit after making sexual advances to a female colleague in the hospital, has to consult a Swedish lawyer (Alexander Skarsgard), son of the lawyer from season 2.

== Production ==
=== &quot;Riget: Exodus&quot; (2022) ===
In December 2020, Danmarks Radio announced that a third and final season, consisting of five episodes directed by von Trier and co-written by von Trier alongside original series co-writer Niels Vørsel, would begin filming in 2021 under the title &quot;Riget: Exodus&quot;. The same year, von Trier began showing symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease during an interview with Christian Lund of Louisiana Channel; afterwards, he continued to work while taking medication. Von Trier did not watch &quot;all the old ones&quot; before beginning work on &quot;Riget: Exodus&quot;, and had tried &quot;to get rid of the ties from the old stuff&quot;, with the focus being on the characters.

Returning cast members Ghita Nørby, Søren Pilmark, Peter Mygind, Birgitte Raaberg, Laura Christensen and Udo Kier are joined by newcomers Bodil Jørgensen, Nicolas Bro, Lars Mikkelsen, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Mikael Persbrandt, Tuva Novotny, Ida Engvoll, Asta Kamma August, David Dencik and Alexander Skarsgard. Von Trier had a &quot;rotten time&quot; filming the series, as he suffered from the effects of Parkinson&#x27;s disease during the shoot, but hoped the actors &quot;didn&#x27;t notice&quot;.

In September 2022, &quot;Exodus&quot; (presented as a &quot;five hour feature-length film&quot;) screened out of competition at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, alongside Nicolas Winding Refn&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Copenhagen Cowboy&quot;.

=== &quot;Riget: Exodus&quot; (2022) ===
== Release ==

The four-episode first series of &quot;Riget&quot; was aired by Danish broadcaster Danmarks Radio (DR) from 24 November to 15 December 1994. The English subtitled version &quot;The Kingdom&quot; aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two from 1 to 9 April 1997.

The four-episode second series, &quot;Riget II&quot;, aired on DR between 10 and 31 October 1997. The English subtitled version &quot;The Kingdom II&quot; aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two from 28 July to 1 September 2001.

The five-episode third series, &quot;Riget: Exodus&quot;, premiered on streaming platform Viaplay on 9 October 2022.

=== Home media ===
The series was edited into a five-hour, two-part film, which received some theatrical exhibition, and was released on home video in America and the United Kingdom. It is available on DVD in Australia and New Zealand on Madman Entertainment&#x27;s Directors Suite label, in the UK from Second Sight, and in the US from Koch-Lorber Films.

=== Streaming ===
Newly restored HD editions of the first two series premiered on MUBI on 13 November and 20 November 2022, respectively; the debut of the restored series was followed by the premiere of &quot;Exodus&quot; on the platform on 27 November, with its fifth and final episode premiering on Christmas Day.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
On Metacritic, all three seasons has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100.

==== &quot;I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; ====
Film critic Leonard Maltin, who reviewed the two-part theatrical version, awarded it three and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it &quot;a must-see for those who think they&#x27;ve seen everything&quot;.

Despite being a miniseries, &quot;The Kingdom&quot; appears in the best-selling book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, where it is called &quot;a medical horror epic&quot;, with its supernatural elements described as being both eerie and magical.

==== &quot;Exodus&quot; ====

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, 87% of 23 reviews are positive and the average rating is 6.80/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;An acquired taste for newcomers and comfort weirdness for Lars von Trier&#x27;s devotees, &quot;The Kingdom: Exodus&quot; is a cheeky delicacy infused with cosmic horror that reaches biblically insane proportions.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average of 77 out of 100 from nine reviews, indicating a generally positive reception.

&quot;Exodus&quot; was well received by critics following its premiere at the Venice in September 2022, with &quot;Variety&quot; calling it &quot;over-the-top&quot; and &quot;fun&quot;, and the Italian Post praised the series, saying it &quot;amuses and disturbs&quot;, and comparing it positively to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. &quot;The Upcoming&quot; gave the series 3/5, praising its &quot;dark humour&quot; and noting that it feels like a &quot;tribute to Lars von Trier&#x27;s career, a revisiting of his early work... filled with the wobbly handheld shots that distinguished the Dogme 95 movement&quot;. Giving it 3/5 stars, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the series &quot;a nightmarish revue, peppered with familiar faces in brief walk-on roles&quot;, and said that it is &quot;fun to a point and richly textured to a fault, with a plot that’s entirely driven by what has gone before&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
== American adaptation ==

Horror novelist Stephen King discovered the five-hour theatrical edit of &quot;Riget&quot; in a video store during production of the 1997 TV miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Shining&quot;, and, finding it &quot;both funny and scary&quot;, promptly set out to obtain the rights to the series for an American adaptation. At that time, the rights were owned by Columbia Pictures, who had intended to adapt the series as a two-hour theatrical film. King negotiated with Columbia for the rights, ultimately exchanging them for the option to his novella &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden&quot; (which Columbia adapted in 2004 as the feature film &quot;Secret Window&quot;).

King&#x27;s thirteen episode television adaptation, titled &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot;, broadcast between March and July 2004 on ABC. Often directly adapting storylines from the original series, &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; was set in a hospital in Lewiston, Maine, which was on the site of a mill built before the Civil War. Many character names were derived from their Danish equivalents, e.g., Sigrid Drusse became Sally Druse and Stig Helmer became Dr. Stegman. In a departure from the plot of &quot;Riget&quot;, the American series introduces a new protagonist, a comatose patient, Peter Rickman, inspired by King&#x27;s own experience of being hit by a minivan, and a talking giant anteater, the spirit guide Anubis/Antubis.

Although King and co-writer Richard Dooling developed an outline for a second series, ratings dropped throughout the season. &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; was placed on indefinite hiatus following a &quot;major network shake-up&quot;, and was never picked up for a second series.

<text>A Formula One car or F1 car is a single-seat, open-cockpit, open-wheel formula racing car used to compete in Formula One racing events. It has substantial front and rear wings, large wheels, and a turbocharged engine positioned behind the driver. The cars are constructed of carbon fibre and other composite materials for durability and are built to withstand high impact forces and considerable g forces. 

The early F1 cars were simpler designs with no wings, front mounted engines, and required significant driver effort to control. Later improvements saw the introduction of lighter cars due to metallurgical advancements, introduction of ground effect cars with the addition of wings and other aerodynamic surfaces, and control electronics. The introduction of turbocharged engines with higher efficiency, and energy recovery system to boost speeds led to faster and efficient racing cars.

A modern F1 car has a carbon fibre monocoque with an open cockpit consisting of a single driver seat and detachable steering. The 1.6 L V6 engine is capable of producing up to , which enables the car to reach speeds of up to . It uses semi-automatic gear boxes with a seven speed transmission and an electronic-hydraulic control to drive the car. The 18 inch wheels are fitted with slick tyres during normal dry conditions, and are fitted with carbon disc brakes capable of handling temperatures of up to . The wings act as inverted aerofoils to produce negative lift, resulting in increased down force.

The regulations governing the cars are specified by the FIA and have undergone considerable changes since their introduction in the late 1940s. The cars are constructed and operated by the constructors in racing events, though the design and manufacture can be outsourced. Since the 2000s, several changes have been made by the FIA, which are aimed at sustainability and cost reduction, such as the cap on car parts, usage of mixed fuel, and usage of energy recovery systems. It has also sought to reduce the downforce and limit speeds, while simplifying car design and improve close racing. Cars have also been made safer with durable materials, improvement in safety features and addition of halo.

== History ==

The early F1 cars were simpler designs with no wings, front mounted engines, and required significant driver effort to control. In the early 1960s, lighter cars with aluminum chassis were introduced with the addition of wings towards the end of the same decade. In the 1970s, understanding of aerodynamics began to impact the car designs singnificantly, with the introduction of nose boxes in the front, and air boxes behind the driver to increase air flow to the engine. The advent of ground effect cars in the 1980s, allowed to increase downforce with a small drag penalty. With continuous improvement in engines and the introduction of turbochargers, cars produced an increased amount of thrust. The maximum permitted width of the cars was with a front axle and wide rear axle, and the maximum width was reduced to in . 

Following the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, a number of changes were introduced, which led to the development of modern day F1 cars. A thick wooden skid block was added on the underbody to enforce minimum ground clearance. In the following seasons, several modifications were introduced, the underbody plank was lengthened and a tall, wide block was added on top of the plank to minimize the ground effect. The front wing height was increased from and the maximum height was reduced to above the reference plane. A step wise design was introduced with reduced side pods, and engine cowling, and exclusion zones were added around the wheels to prevent any bodywork in the area apart from the suspension.

Since the 1990s, improved electronics were incorporated to increase the efficiency, handling and reliability of the cars. Since the 2000s, with computer aided design, teams have been able to produce more efficient cars, with several changes aimed at sustainability and cost reduction, such as the cap on car parts, usage of mixed fuel, and usage of energy recovery systems. In the 2000s, the front height was increased progressively to and the maximum width and height were defined as and respectively. FIA enacted further changes to the body structure over the subsequent years such to improve racing changes to the structure and height of the front wing, and changes to floor design. The governing body outlawed several structures introduced by the teams, including double diffusers, modified exhaust ducts, and extra aerodynamic elements such as sharklets, cooling slots, winglets and dive planes. Modifiable front wings were also trailed in and the Drag reduction system (DRS) was introduced in . The latest rules in the late 2010s introduced simpler front wings, which reduced the dirty air from the cars, and enabled more closer racing. The underside of the vehicle must be flat between the axles with the wear of skid block limited to a maximum of during the race. The latest regulations which came into effect in with the intention of enabling more closer racing, simplified the aerodynamic components, which reduced vortices, and created more ground effect.

== Design ==
The modern Formula One car is a single-seat, open-cockpit, open-wheel racing car with substantial front and rear wings, large wheels, and a turbocharged engine positioned behind the driver. The monocoque is constructed of reinforced carbon fibre, lined with kevlar and fire resistant materials to protect the drivers from high impact crashes and fires. The driver cockpit consists of single seat with a detachable steering wheel in the front. There is a halo mounted on top of the open cockpit, which was introduced in . Two front and rear wheels are bolted to the suspension and the engine is mounted behind the driver. The front and rear wings are aerodynamic surfaces fitted on the extremes. The minimum weight permissible is including the driver, while fitted with dry-weather tyres and no fuel. The cars are limited to dimensions of in length, in width, and in height.

=== Engine and fuel ===


Since its inception, Formula One has used a number of different engine regulations. During the early years, a front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout was used with a 4.5 L naturally aspirated or a 1.5 L supercharged engine capable of an output power of up to . Progressively the engine capacity and power were reduced, and was limited to 0.75 L with compressor or 2.5 L without one during the late 1950s. In 1961, the engine was positioned behind the driver and the capacity was regulated to 1300–1500 cc with a power output of 150–225 hp without supercharging. In 1966, FIA increased engine capacity and allowed up to 3.0 L atmospheric with a power range of or 1.5 L supercharged with a power range of . While the basic structure and configuration of a Formula One remained same since the late 1960s, the power output of the engines increased progressively to at 12000 rpm in 1986. In 1987-88, turbocharged eight-cylinder engines were introduced alongside atmospheric engines with fuel caps for races introduced for turbocharged engines. Turbocharges were banned from 1989 with 3.0 L engines becoming the norm in the 1990s and led to the introduction of V10 and V12 engines.

The teams started constructing engine components using advanced metal alloys such as titanium and beryllium, which reduced weight and improved the efficiency and durability. FIA outlawed the use of these towards the late 1990s with only iron and aluminum permitted. The introduction of pneumatic valve springs in the same period allowed the engines to reach up to 20,000 rpm. For a decade, the F1 cars had run with 3.0 L naturally aspirated V10 engines producing of power with top speeds of up to . Though the FIA continually enforced material and design restrictions to limit power, the V10s in the 2005 season were reported to develop , power levels not seen since the ban on turbocharged engines in 1989. Before the 2006 season, FIA introduced a new engine formula, which mandated cars to be powered by 2.4 liter naturally aspirated V8 engine configuration, with no more than four valves per cylinder and banned variable intake trumpets. For the 2009 season, the engines were limited to 18,000 rpm to improve engine reliability and cut costs. In 2012, the engines consumed around of air per second with a race fuel consumption rate of .

For the 2014 season, FIA introduced 1.6 L six-cylinder turbocharged engines with a kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) to increase fuel-efficiency. For , a modified V6 configuration was introduced with a more powerful KERS. Over the years, FIA has been gradually reducing the overall allocation of engines per season and with the increasing number of races, each engine is expected to last for at least . FIA had also introduced standardization of certain engine parts and cap on engine components to reduce costs with grid penalties applied for drivers who exceed the allocation. As per the current regulations, a maximum of five power units are allowed per season. The engine is located between the driver and the rear axle and is bolted to the cockpit at the front end, and transmission and rear suspension at the back end.

The fuel used in F1 cars is a mixture of unleaded petrol and ethanol with a tightly controlled mixture ratio. As a part of the regulation change in 2022, the ethanol content was increased from 5.75% to 10%. Cars were allowed to be refuelled during the race till 2010, after which refueling was banned. The cars are stipulated to carry a maximum fuel of 110 kg per race, with at least 1 kg to be made available to the FIA for post race inspection. Any abnormalties in the fuel or failure to provide the sample results in disqualification from the race. The fuel bladder is made of high quality rubber lined with kevlar for protection against crashes and is located in front of the engine, behind the cockpit.

=== Steering and transmission ===
A typical steering wheel used in a F1 car is an electronic control with an array of knobs, buttons and levers. It is made of carbon fibre with titanium, silicon, fibreglass, and copper parts. It has two driver handles on the sides with a LCD display in the center, LED gear shift lights at the top and gear shift paddles in the back. The steering wheel is used to control various functions of the car such as gears, engine revolutions, fuel–air mix, brake balance, differential mapping, among others. The display displays various data points including engine parameters, gears, temperature and time. The steering wheel is also used to access the radio and control the drinking mechanism. It weighs about and can cost about $50,000. 

While conventional manual gearboxes were used earlier, modern Formula One cars use semi-automatic sequential gearboxes with a rear-wheel-drive. It has eight forward gears and a reverse gear operated with paddle-shifters. The gearbox is constructed of carbon reinforced titanium, and is bolted onto the back of the engine. Fully-automatic gearboxes, and systems such as launch control and traction control were banned in the 2000s to keep driver skill and involvement important in controlling the car, and reduce costs. When the driver initiates gear shifts using paddles mounted on the back of the steering wheel, a system of solenoids, hydraulic actuators, and sensors perform the actual shift, and electronic throttle control. Clutch control is also performed in the same manner except when launching from neutral into first gear, where the driver operates the clutch manually using a lever on the back of the steering wheel. The clutch is a multi-plate carbon design with a diameter of less than , and weight of less than , capable of handling up to . The cars use seamless shift transmissions, which allow almost instantaneous changing of gears with minimum loss of drive and a shift times of 2–3 ms. As a measure to reduce costs, gearbox ratios are fixed for a season and a team is allowed a maximum of four gearboxes per season.

=== Wheels and tyres ===

During the 1950s and 1960s, Formula One tyres were treaded rubber tyres similar to the automobile tyres but larger. In the late 1950s, cotton fabric was replaced with nylon fabric, which reduced weight and increased durability. In the 1960s, the tyres became wider and synthetic rubber was used along with nylon. Slick tyres were introduced for the first time during the 1971 season. In the 1975 season, the cars used 26.0&quot;×16.2&quot;–13&quot; slick tyre (diameter × width) in the rear on a 13&quot;×18&quot; rim, and a 20.0&quot;×9.2&quot;–13&quot; slick tyre in the front on a 13×10&quot; rim. For the 1981 season, the maximum diameter of the rear tyre was limited to 26.0&quot;, and the diameter of the front tyres was increased, with the tyres measuring 25.0&quot;×10.0&quot;–13&quot; in the front and 26.0&quot;×15.0&quot;–13&quot; in the rear. Ahead of the 1993 season, the width of the rear was reduced from 18&quot; to 15&quot;. In 1998, grooved tyres were introduced with three groove lines in the front tyres and four groove lines in the rear tyres. Between and , regulations required the tyres to feature a minimum of four grooves in them, with the intention of slowing the cars down as the slick tyre, with no indentations, provides the most grip in dry conditions. The tyre sizes were limited to at the front and at the rear, and the maximum diameter was for dry and for wet tyres. Briefly in , tyre changes during the race were outlawed and the tyre compounds were made harder to last the full race distance. 

Slick tyres were reintroduced at the beginning of , with the front tyres narrowed from to , to shift the balance towards mechanical grip in an attempt to increase overtaking. Since the introduction of slick tyres in 2009, the tyre construct has remained almost the same with only variations to tyre sizes. The teams are given a fixed number of sets of three compounds of slick dry weather tyres, and additional sets of grooved intermediate and wet weather tyres for a race weekend. The tyre compounds are demarcated by a colour coding, with the teams mandated to use at least two dry compounds during a dry race. Briefly in 2016, teams were given an option to choose tyre compounds. For the 2017 F1 season, significantly wider Pirelli tyres were introduced at both the front and rear axles, while the overall diameter of the tyres was increased from . Front tyre size increased to 305/670-R13 while rear-tyre size increased to 405/670-R13. For the 2022 F1 season, the wheel rim diameter size was increased from , and the diameter was increased from .

Disc brakes are used for braking, similar to road cars. The brakes consist of a rotor disc and a caliper, with six piston clamp pads inside each caliper. The driver applies pressure on the brake pedal, which uses hydraulic pressure to drive the clamps and the friction on the disc slows the car. The front brakes are simpler with direct pressure applied onto the breaking discs to slow down. In the rear, braking is achieved by the combination of three forces, friction on the brakes, resistance from the engine, and the energy recovery system. The driver can control the effect of these and brake distribution using the steering wheel. 
An average F1 car can decelerate from in less than and hence the brakes are subjected to high temperatures of up to and severe g forces. To withstand high temperatures, brakes are made of carbon composites. The brakes are cooled by air passing through numerous small holes in the brake ducts.

=== Wings ===
Early designs linked wings directly to the suspension, but several accidents led to rules stating that wings must be fixed rigidly to the chassis. The wings are aerofoils on the front and rear of the car, and are made of carbon fibre composites for higher strength and reduced weight. The front wing is a forked structure with a maximum width of and must not extend more than beyond the center line. It can have a maximum of four wing elements and should not bend more than . It is made of aluminium alloy, carbon fibre and fibre glass, and can cost up to $300,000. The rear wing consists of a main plane which spans the width of the car with smaller horizontal flaps that angle downwards. There are short upright tabs on the trailing edge of the flaps with vertical end plates at the wing tips. The DRS is a flap adjustment mechanism in the rear wings that is operated hydraulically following steering inputs from the driver.

=== Energy recovery system ===
The kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) recovers the kinetic energy created by the car&#x27;s braking process. It stores that energy and converts it into power that can be used to boost acceleration. There are principally two types of systems: electrical and mechanical flywheel. Electrical systems use a motor-generator incorporated in the car&#x27;s transmission which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Once the energy has been harnessed, it is stored in a battery and released at will. Mechanical systems capture braking energy and use it to turn a small flywheel which can spin at high speeds. When extra power is required, the flywheel is connected to the car&#x27;s rear wheels. KERS typically adds additional power boost for a specific time.

=== Other elements ===
A nose box or nose cone is a structure to which the front wing is attached. It directs the airflow towards the floor of the car, and acts as a shock absorber in case of accidents. It is made of high strength composite materials and is subjected to various load tests by the FIA to ensure its rigidity. The halo is a safety device mounted on the cockpit, and is made of series of curved metal bars intended to protect the driver&#x27;s head during crashes. The air box is situated behind the cockpit, and serves as the receptacle of the high speed air moving over the body. It supplies the pressurized air to the engine intakes, boosting its power and absorbs the turbulence generated from the air passing over the driver&#x27;s helmet. Air filters are used to filter the dirty air before being passed into the engines.

== Aerodynamics ==
Aerodynamics has become key to success in the sport, and the teams spend time and money on research and development of the same each year. The sculpted front and rear wings with the rest of the body parts such as the vanes beneath the nose, bargeboards, sidepods, underbody, and the rear diffuser, play a role in determining the aerodynamic efficiency of the car. A modern Formula One car capable of developing up to six G of lateral cornering force and a downforce equivalent to twice its weight at . The car is designed to create the maximum amount of downforce for the minimal amount of drag with the configuration often modified to the requirements of a particular track. The interaction of various components amplify the total downforce more than the sum of their standalone contributions.

The wings operate similarly to inverted airplane wings, to produce a negative lift or downward force. The profile of the front wing, along with the angle of attack against the incoming air, define the downforce generated. Other smaller elements such as flaps, and gaps between the elements help with controlling the airflow. A steeper angle of attack increases the downforce while creating increased drag. The front wing also directs the airflow to the rest of the car with the air flowing into the sidepod intakes used for the temperature regulation of the engine. The air flowing underneath the floor helps to seal the gap with the ground, contributing to the ground effect. A low-pressure area is created which effectively sucks the car towards the ground, increasing the down force and grip of the car. The designers aspire for a smoother airflow over the body of the car, while minimizing the wakes formed by the rotating wheels.Vortices created between the front wing and the nose box help to reduce the turbulence. Minor changes to the front wing can have drastic effects on the aerodynamics of the car.

The rear wings serve similarly to the front wings as inverted airfoils, and deflect the air downwards, causing a down force. The angle of the main plane and flaps determine the direction of the airflow, with other elements used to further fine tune the same. Higher angles increase downforce while also contributing to a higher turbulence and decreased stability of the rear wing. The rear wings are designed so as to withstand high loads without decreasing the downforce. The other structural elements of the car such as the side pods, and body work determine the amount of air flowing through the rear wings. The rear wing generates vortexes which keep the airflow attached to the car longer, delaying the aerodynamic stall. The rear wing can be modified to various configurations depending on the race track and the circumstances. The DRS opens a slot in the rear wing at the behest of the driver. It reduces drag and increases power, and hence speed, and is allowed to be operated in specific instances. The diffuser located at the rear is used to combine the pressurized airflow from the underside of the car to create more downforce.

== Performance == 
The 1.6 L V6 engine on a modern F1 car churn out at 15,000 rpm. This enables a modern F1 car to accelerate from in 1.8 seconds, and from in 2.6 seconds. It has a power-to-weight ratio of 1,297 hp/t, which would theoretically allow the car to reach in less than a second. However, due to traction loss, it accelerates slower and when the traction loss is minimal at higher speeds, the car accelerates at a very high rate. A F1 car is also capable of rapid deceleration and cornering at high speeds. Due to rapid acceleration and deceleration, the drivers may experience high levels of g force. The drivers experience 3–4 g during acceleration, and 5–6 g when braking from high speeds. During cornering at high speeds, drivers experience lateral forces between 4–6.5 g.

A modern F1 car can achieve top speeds of nearly , and operate on average speeds of about during a race. Top speeds in practice are achieved in straight parts of a track, and is determined by the aerodynamic configuration of the car in balancing between high straight-line speed (low aerodynamic drag) and high cornering speed (high downforce) to achieve the fastest lap time. In 2005, Mclaren recorded a record top speed of during testing, which was officially recognised by the FIA as the fastest speed ever achieved by an F1 car. At the 2016 Mexican Grand Prix, the Williams of Valtteri Bottas reached a top speed of in racing conditions. Away from the track, the BAR Honda team used a modified BAR 007 car, to set an unofficial speed record of on a one way straight-line run on 6 November 2005 at Bonneville Speedway and the car set an FIA ratified record of on 21 July 2006 Bonneville.

<doc id="645101" wikidata="Q1668455" url="?curid=645101" title="Alexander Butterfield">
<text>Alexander Porter Butterfield (born April 6, 1926) is a retired United States Air Force officer, public official, and businessman. He served as the deputy assistant to President Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1973. He revealed the White House taping system&#x27;s existence on July 13, 1973, during the Watergate investigation but had no other involvement in the scandal. From 1973 to 1975, he served as administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.

==Early life and Air Force career==
Butterfield was born April 6, 1926, in Pensacola, Florida, to Susan Armistead Alexander Butterfield and United States Navy pilot (later rear admiral) Horace B. Butterfield. He grew up in Coronado, California, and left home in 1943. Butterfield enrolled in college at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he became a friend of H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. He left the university to join the United States Air Force in 1948.

Initially, Butterfield was stationed at Las Vegas Air Force Base (now Nellis Air Force Base) as a fighter-gunnery instructor before being transferred to the 86th Fighter Wing in Munich, West Germany, in November 1951, where he was a member of the jet fighter acrobatic team. He later served as the operations officer of a fighter-interceptor squadron in Knoxville, Tennessee, before being promoted to commander of a fighter squadron at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. During the Vietnam War, Butterfield commanded a squadron of low and medium-level combat tactical air reconnaissance aircraft. He flew 98 combat missions and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1965 and 1966, Butterfield served as the military assistant to the special assistant to the Secretary of Defense, where he became a friend of Alexander Haig. He also gained extensive experience working at the White House, where he spent half his time. He advanced to the rank of colonel and, beginning in 1967, was serving in Australia as the F-111 project officer; representative for the commander-in-chief of the Pacific forces; and senior U.S. military representative.

During his military career, he attended the National War College, and earned a bachelor of science degree from the University of Maryland (1956) and a master of science degree from George Washington University (1967).

==White House assistant==
===Obtaining a position===
In late 1968, Butterfield learned that he would be stationed in Australia for another two years, delaying any potential promotion and potentially harming his military career. The ambitious Butterfield wanted to be in &quot;the smoke&quot; (where the action was), and wanted to leave Australia. After coming across a newspaper article which mentioned the appointment of H. R. Haldeman as Nixon&#x27;s White House Chief of Staff, Butterfield wrote to Haldeman asking for a job. The two met in New York City about December 19, 1968, to discuss a role as a military aide, but when nothing suitable came up, Butterfield asked to take any job in the White House. General Andrew Goodpaster, former White House staff secretary in the Eisenhower administration, suggested that Haldeman have a deputy, and Haldeman offered the position to Butterfield about January 13. Butterfield retired from the Air Force a few days later, and his appointment as deputy assistant to the president was announced on January 23, 1969.

===Role as deputy assistant===
As deputy assistant to the president, Butterfield was Haldeman&#x27;s chief assistant. His first few days in the White House were difficult. Butterfield did not meet the president for 13 days. When Haldeman finally introduced Butterfield to Nixon, their meeting was short and awkward. Haldeman then left for California, leaving Butterfield in charge of the White House staff for four days. During the second meeting with Butterfield, Nixon was rude and condescending, and Butterfield nearly resigned. The following day, however, Nixon was cordial and witty, and Butterfield resolved to stay at the White House. Butterfield, who came to like Nixon immensely, nevertheless felt the president was an &quot;ignorant boor, a bumpkin&quot;. Initially, when meeting with Nixon, Butterfield had to mimic Haldeman&#x27;s mannerisms and to duplicate his managerial style. Everything Haldeman and Butterfield did was designed to make Nixon feel comfortable and relaxed, never surprised or &quot;spooked&quot;. Haldeman told him, &quot;If you don&#x27;t do things exactly as I do, it could upset [Nixon].&quot;

Next to Haldeman, Butterfield was the most powerful aide in the White House. He met with Nixon and Haldeman every day at 2 p.m. to plan the following day&#x27;s activities. He &quot;completely controlled&quot; what paperwork Nixon saw and logged memos. He accompanied Haldeman on all domestic trips, co-supervised traveling White House staff with Haldeman, and ran the White House when Haldeman and Nixon went on foreign trips. Every meeting the president attended required &quot;talking points&quot; for Nixon written by an appropriate staff person as well as an after-meeting summary by that person, and Butterfield oversaw the process by which both documents were completed and filed. Butterfield also oversaw all FBI investigations requested by the White House, which included routine background checks of potential employees as well as politically motivated investigations. Other than Haldeman, no one had a more intimate knowledge of Nixon&#x27;s working style, the daily operations of the White House, what Nixon may have read, or who Nixon may have met.

Butterfield was also the person who primarily managed people as they met with Nixon. This included ensuring people arrived on time, and that they did not stay too long. Butterfield also oversaw Nixon&#x27;s often-distant relationship with his wife, Pat. Late in 1970, the president&#x27;s aides lost confidence in Constance C. Stuart, Pat Nixon&#x27;s staff director and press secretary, and Butterfield was assigned responsibility for overseeing the First Lady&#x27;s events and publicity. The day after the 1972 presidential election, Pat Nixon confronted her husband over what she perceived to be Oval Office interference with her staff. Deputy assistant to the president Dwight Chapin and later Butterfield were appointed to act as liaison between the two staffs.

===Installing the taping system===
Butterfield also oversaw installation of the taping system which Nixon ordered for the White House. On February 10, 1971, Haldeman&#x27;s assistant, Lawrence Higby, told Butterfield that Nixon wanted a voice-activated audio taping system installed in the Oval Office and on White House telephones. The goal, Nixon said, was to create a more accurate record of events. Butterfield worked with the Secret Service to install five hidden microphones in Nixon&#x27;s desk in the Oval Office, two in lamps on the mantel over the fireplace, two in the cabinet room, and on all telephone lines in the Lincoln Sitting Room and Oval Office. According to Butterfield, the system was highly secret, its existence known only to Nixon, Haldeman, Higby, and the three or four Secret Service technical staffers who installed it. In April 1971, Nixon ordered the taping system to be installed in his private office in the Executive Office Building.

===Resignation===
In March 1973, Butterfield was confirmed as administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and resigned from his position at the White House.

==Revelation of the taping system==
===Speculation on its existence===
John Dean testified in June 1973 that Nixon was deeply involved in the Watergate cover-up, and mentioned that he suspected White House conversations were taped. Staff of the United States Senate Watergate Committee, thereafter, began to routinely ask witnesses appearing before the committee if they knew of any taping system. Senate Watergate Committee staff then asked the White House for a list of dates on which the President had met with Dean. About June 20 or 21, Special White House Counsel for Watergate J. Fred Buzhardt provided the committee&#x27;s Chief Minority (Republican) Counsel, Fred Thompson, with a document intended to impugn Dean&#x27;s testimony. Buzhardt&#x27;s document included almost verbatim quotations from meetings Nixon had with Dean. Thompson initially violated an agreement under which the majority and minority staff would share all information. When committee Majority Investigator Scott Armstrong obtained the document, he realized it indicated the existence of a taping system.

===July 13 questioning===

Butterfield was questioned by Senate Watergate Committee staff Scott Armstrong, G. Eugene Boyce, Marianne Brazer, and Donald Sanders (deputy minority counsel) on Friday, July 13, 1973, in a background interview prior to his public testimony before the full committee. Butterfield was brought before the committee because he was Haldeman&#x27;s top deputy and was the only person other than Haldeman who knew as much about the president&#x27;s day-to-day behavior.

The critical line of questioning was conducted by Donald Sanders. Armstrong had given a copy of Buzhardt&#x27;s report to Butterfield; now Sanders asked if the quotations in it might have come from notes. Butterfield said no, that the quotations were too detailed. In addition, Butterfield said that neither staff nor the president kept notes of one-on-one private meetings with Nixon. When asked where the quotations might have come from, Butterfield said he did not know. Then Sanders asked if there was any validity to John Dean&#x27;s hypothesis that the White House had taped conversations in the Oval Office. Butterfield replied, &quot;I was wondering if someone would ask that. There is tape in the Oval Office.&quot; Butterfield then told the investigators that, while he had hoped that no one would ask about the taping system, he had previously decided he would disclose its existence if asked a direct question. Butterfield then testified extensively about when the taping system was installed and how it worked, telling the staff members, &quot;&quot;Everything&quot; was taped... as long as the President was in attendance. There was not so much as a hint that something should &quot;not be taped&quot;.&quot; Butterfield later said that he assumed the committee knew about the taping system, since they had already interviewed Haldeman and Higby.

All present recognized the significance of this disclosure, and, as former political adviser to President Gerald Ford James M. Cannon put it, &quot;Watergate was transformed&quot;. Butterfield&#x27;s testimony lasted from 2 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. The four investigators swore themselves to secrecy and agreed to tell only the Chief Counsel and Chief Minority Counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee. Chief Counsel Samuel Dash says he immediately informed his subordinate, Deputy Chief Counsel Rufus L. Edmisten, and then Democratic Senator Sam Ervin, chairman of the committee. Both Ervin and Dash realized how important it was politically to have had a Republican uncover the taping system. That same night, Ervin asked Dash to have Butterfield testify on Monday, July 16.

===July 16 questioning===
Friday night, Thompson informed Senator Howard Baker, the ranking minority member on the Senate Watergate Committee, of Butterfield&#x27;s admission. After Ervin had told him the news as well, Baker began pushing to have Butterfield testify immediately. Again breaking rules not to have private conversations or meetings with the White House, Thompson also informed Buzhardt about Butterfield&#x27;s Friday night interview.

Butterfield, scheduled to fly to Moscow on July 17 for a trade meeting, was worried that he would be called to testify before the Senate Watergate Committee and that this would force him to cancel his Russia trip.

Sources vary as to the next sequence of events. According to some sources, Butterfield was notified on the morning of Sunday, July 15, that he would testify the next day. Butterfield then met with Baker (whom he knew slightly). Butterfield asked Baker to use his influence to cancel the testimony, but Baker declined. Butterfield then called the White House and left a message for Special Counsel Leonard Garment (Dean&#x27;s replacement), advising him of the content of his Friday testimony and the committee&#x27;s subpoena for him to testify on Monday. Haig and Buzhardt received Butterfield&#x27;s message, and waited for Garment to return from a cross-country trip later that day. After Garment was informed, the White House staff did nothing. Butterfield was not contacted, and Nixon was not told about Butterfield&#x27;s testimony until either Monday morning or late Monday afternoon. According to Butterfield and other sources, Butterfield left a message about his Friday interview for Garment at the White House on Saturday night. He then met with Baker Sunday morning, but Baker told him the chances were slim that he would be called to testify. According to Butterfield, he did not learn that he was going to testify before the Ervin committee until shortly after 10 a.m. on Monday, July 16, just about three hours before he was due to appear at 2 p.m.

Butterfield&#x27;s July 16 testimony, which lasted just 30 minutes, was carried on live television by all the major broadcast networks. Senator Baker informed Dash before the hearing began that, since a Republican (Sanders) had elicited the testimony from Butterfield on July 13, he wanted Republican Chief Minority Counsel Thompson to question Butterfield during the hearing. Baker did not want the Republicans to look as if they had been caught by surprise. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Butterfield&#x27;s testimony &quot;dramatic&quot;, and historian William Doyle has noted that it &quot;electrified Washington and triggered a constitutional crisis&quot;. Political scientist Keith W. Olson said Butterfield&#x27;s testimony &quot;fundamentally altered the entire Watergate investigation.&quot;

Within hours of Butterfield&#x27;s testimony, Haig had the taping system removed.

==Post-Watergate==
===Watergate revelations===
Butterfield was not involved in the Watergate cover-up and was never charged with any crime.

Butterfield did, however, play a minor role in Watergate. Nixon had $1.6 million in campaign funds left over from the 1968 election. Determined to raise as much re-election money as he could before a new federal campaign finance law took effect on April 7, 1972, Nixon&#x27;s staff and political operatives began raising large amounts of cash. Some of this cash was used for illegal purposes connected with the Watergate scandal, such as surveillance and paying for the Watergate burglary. Haldeman retained $350,000 in cash in a locked briefcase in the office of Hugh W. Sloan Jr. at the Committee for the Re-Election of the President. Haldeman said the case, colloquially known as &quot;the 350&quot;, was for polling operations. Haldeman aide Gordon C. Strachan moved the cash to the White House in April 1972, but Haldeman ordered it removed. Strachan then asked Butterfield to handle the cash by giving it to someone Butterfield trusted. On April 7, Butterfield removed the cash and met a close friend at the Key Bridge Marriott in Rosslyn, Virginia. The friend agreed to keep the cash in a safe deposit box in Arlington County, Virginia, and make it available to the White House on demand. Butterfield voluntarily revealed his role in &quot;the 350&quot; to United States Attorneys shortly after leaving the White House in March 1973.

Butterfield also played a very limited role in some of the surveillance conducted by the Nixon White House. On September 7, 1972, Nixon met with Haldeman and Ehrlichman to discuss Senator Edward M. Kennedy&#x27;s request for Secret Service protection while he campaigned on behalf of the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator George McGovern. Haldeman suggested Butterfield handle the details, and Butterfield, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman met with Nixon later that day to discuss planting a mole. Nixon was convinced Kennedy was an adulterer, and wanted to catch him &quot;in the sack with one of his babes&quot;. Butterfield assigned former Nixon bodyguard Robert Newbrand as the spy in Kennedy&#x27;s protective detail on September 8.

===Federal Aviation Administration===
By late 1972, Butterfield felt his job no longer challenged him, and he informally told President Nixon that he wanted to leave. Nixon offered him a position in the State Department, but Butterfield was not interested in it. Nixon then suggested the Federal Aviation Administration, and Butterfield agreed.

On December 19, 1972, President Nixon nominated Butterfield to be the new Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. Federal law, however, required that the Administrator be a civilian, not an active-duty or retired military officer. President Nixon sought legislation to waive this requirement for Butterfield, but it was not forthcoming. Subsequently, in February 1973 Butterfield resigned from the Air Force Reserves, giving up a $10,000 a year pension. President Nixon withdrew Butterfield&#x27;s nomination on February 26, 1973, and resubmitted it to the Senate the same day. Butterfield was confirmed on March 12, 1973, and he resigned as Deputy Assistant to the President on March 14.

United States Secretary of Transportation Claude Brinegar often criticized Butterfield for being lax on aviation safety, allegations Butterfield strongly denied. In early January 1975, President Gerald Ford asked for the resignation of all executive branch officeholders who had been prominent in the Nixon administration. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, quoting anonymous White House sources, said Butterfield&#x27;s dismissal was not retaliation for his role in revealing the White House taping system, and allowed Butterfield to make a case for keeping his job with new White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld.

Butterfield did not retain his position, although the White House allowed him to take several months before resigning. Butterfield resigned on March 25, 1975, and left the government on March 31, 1975.

===Post-government career===
Butterfield struggled for two years to find employment after leaving the federal government. He eventually worked for a flight service company in San Francisco, California. He then found work with a financial holding company in Los Angeles. Butterfield left the financial industry to start a business and productivity consulting firm, Armistead &amp; Alexander. He retired in 1995.

Butterfield was among those who correctly guessed the identity of Watergate informant &quot;Deep Throat&quot; prior to the disclosure in 2005. He told the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; in 1995, &quot;I think it was a guy named Mark Felt.&quot;

Butterfield is a major source for Bob Woodward&#x27;s 2015 book &quot;The Last of the President&#x27;s Men&quot;. Butterfield retained an extensive number of records when he left the White House, some of them historically important, including the &quot;zilch&quot; memo, which helped form part of the basis for the book.

On July 11, 2022, Butterfield was a guest on Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s MSNBC show, &quot;The Last Word&quot;.

Cassidy Hutchinson, former aide in the Trump administration, testified to the January 6 Committee that she drew on Butterfield&#x27;s experience and example when deciding to go back to the Committee to testify fully and truthfully, despite significant legal and political pressure from Trump world. Butterfield said that Cassidy Hutchinson will be an inspiration to other young people, and asked Hutchinson to promise to help out someone if they are in a similar situation in the future.

==Personal life==
Butterfield married Charlotte Maguire in 1949. They divorced in 1985.

Butterfield moved to La Jolla, California, in 1992, where he was a close friend of (and sometimes dated) Audrey Geisel, the widow of Theodor Geisel (the author of children&#x27;s books, known as &quot;Dr. Seuss&quot;). He returned to school, obtaining a master&#x27;s degree in history from the University of California, San Diego. , he was working on a Ph.D. in history, with a focus on the presidential power to pardon. he remains active on the boards of directors of several corporations.

<doc id="645102" wikidata="Q468202" url="?curid=645102" title="Art Pepper">
<text>Arthur Edward Pepper Jr. (September 1, 1925 – June 15, 1982) was an American jazz musician, most known as an alto saxophonist. He occasionally performed and recorded on tenor saxophone, clarinet (his first instrument) and bass clarinet. Active primarily in West Coast jazz, Pepper first came to prominence in Stan Kenton&#x27;s big band. He was known for his emotionally charged performances and several stylistic shifts throughout his career, and was described by critic Scott Yanow as having &quot;attained his goal of becoming the world&#x27;s greatest altoist&quot; at the time of his death in 1982.

==Early life==
Art Pepper was born in Gardena, California, United States. His mother was a 14-year-old runaway; his father, a merchant seaman. Both were violent alcoholics, and when Pepper was still quite young, he was sent to live with his paternal grandmother. He expressed early musical interest and talent, and he was given lessons. He began playing clarinet at the age of nine, switched to alto saxophone at 13, and immediately began jamming on Central Avenue, the black nightclub district of Los Angeles.

==Career==

At the age of 17, he began playing professionally with Benny Carter and then became part of the Stan Kenton orchestra, touring with that band until he was drafted in 1943. After the war, he returned to Los Angeles, and joined the Kenton Innovations Orchestra. By the 1950s, Pepper was recognized as one of the leading alto saxophonists in jazz, finishing second only to Charlie Parker as Best Alto Saxophonist in the &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine Readers Poll of 1952. Along with Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan, and Shelly Manne, and perhaps due more to geography than playing style, Pepper is often associated with the musical movement known as West Coast jazz, as contrasted with the East Coast (or &quot;hot&quot;) jazz of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis. Some of Pepper&#x27;s best known albums from the 1950s are &quot;Art Pepper Meets the Rhythm Section&quot;, &quot;Art Pepper + Eleven – Modern Jazz Classics&quot;, &quot;Gettin&#x27; Together&quot;, and &quot;Smack Up&quot;. Other recordings from this time appear on &quot;The Aladdin Recordings&quot; (three volumes), &quot;The Early Show&quot;, &quot;The Late Show&quot;, &quot;Surf Ride&quot;, and &quot;Art Pepper with Warne Marsh&quot; (also issued as &quot;The Way It Was!&quot;), which features a session recorded with tenor saxophonist Warne Marsh.

His career was repeatedly interrupted by several prison stints stemming from his addiction to heroin, but Pepper managed to have several productive &quot;comebacks&quot;. Remarkably, his substance abuse and legal travails did not affect the quality of his recordings, which maintained a high level of musicianship throughout his career until his death in 1982.

His last comeback saw Pepper, who had started his career in Stan Kenton&#x27;s big band, becoming a member of Buddy Rich&#x27;s Big Band from 1968 to 1969. After beginning methadone therapy in the mid-1970s, he toured Europe and Japan with his own groups and recorded many albums, mostly for Galaxy Records, a subsidiary of Fantasy Records. Pepper&#x27;s later albums include &quot;Living Legend&quot;, &quot;Art Pepper Today&quot;, &quot;Among Friends&quot;, and &quot;Live in Japan&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pepper lived for many years in the hills of Echo Park, in Los Angeles. He became a heroin addict in the 1940s, and his career was interrupted by drug-related prison sentences in 1954–56, 1960–61, 1961–64, and 1964–65; the final two sentences were served in San Quentin. While in San Quentin, he played in an ensemble with saxophonist Frank Morgan. In the late 1960s, Pepper spent time in Synanon, a rehabilitation program that turned out to be a cult.

His autobiography, &quot;Straight Life&quot; (1980, co-written with his third wife Laurie Pepper), discusses the jazz music world, as well as drug and criminal subcultures of mid-20th century California. Among the many anecdotes shared from his life, Pepper boasts of raping a woman while stationed in London during the Second World War (deserved, in his view, because he had shared whiskey and walked several miles with her). Soon after the publication of this book, director Don McGlynn released the documentary film &quot;Art Pepper: Notes from a Jazz Survivor&quot;, discussing his life and featuring interviews with both Art and his wife Laurie, as well as footage from a live performance in a Malibu jazz club. Laurie Pepper also released an interview to NPR.

Pepper died of a stroke in Los Angeles on June 15, 1982, aged 56. He is interred in the Abbey of the Psalms Mausoleum in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood.

<doc id="645103" wikidata="Q6386029" url="?curid=645103" title="Kelly Flinn">
<text>Kelly Flinn (whose surname was sometimes misspelled as Flynn; born December 23, 1970) is a former B-52 pilot in the United States Air Force (USAF). She was the first female pilot to serve in that capacity.

She was discharged from the U.S. Air Force in 1997 after an adulterous affair with the husband of an enlisted subordinate, for military offenses including disobeying a direct order from her commanding officer to break off the affair, and for twice lying under oath to investigators about having done so.

The scandal received widespread media attention at the time and was discussed in a U.S. Senate hearing on May 22, 1997.
Kelly Flinn worked as a commercial pilot for Trans World Airlines after leaving the Air Force.

==Background==
Flinn was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the youngest of five children. She decided to become a pilot after attending Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama. She attended the U.S. Air Force Academy, undergraduate pilot training, and follow-on B-52 bomber training, becoming the first female B-52 pilot in the USAF.

==Charges, media coverage, and disposition==
On May 20, 1997, following an adulterous affair with a civilian soccer coach at Minot Air Force Base who was married to a female enlisted subordinate in her chain of command, Flinn was charged by the military with conduct unbecoming an officer, disobeying a lawful order (in writing, to stay away from the married man), making a false official statement in which she lied under oath to Air Force investigators, falsely telling them she had ended the affair, and fraternization (for an additional affair that she had with an enlisted man).

Flinn&#x27;s case, due in part to her high visibility in Air Force recruitment advertisements, drew national attention, eventually creating a media circus. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Ronald Fogleman, testified at a congressional hearing that, &quot;In the end, this is not an issue of adultery. This is an issue about an officer, entrusted to fly nuclear weapons, who lied.&quot; The media, however, largely treated the case as though Flinn were being tried by the military for the crime of adultery, and castigated the Air Force for allegedly firing her on moral grounds; a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial on the case emphasized the adultery, rather than the actual military charges with which she was charged, and blamed the military&#x27;s &quot;antiquated adultery rules and their consistency in administering them, as well as their management training.&quot;

Following the media outcry, Flinn was allowed to resign from the Air Force by Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Widnall with a general discharge instead of facing a court-martial. She later wrote a book recounting her experiences, entitled &quot;Proud to Be: My Life, the Air Force, the Controversy&quot; (; ).

<doc id="645108" wikidata="Q1638376" url="?curid=645108" title="Iris (American band)">
<text>Iris was an American synthpop band, formed by Reagan Jones and Mat Morris in 1993. After the release of their first album &quot;Disconnect&quot;, Matthew Morris was replaced with Andrew Sega, who pushed the band&#x27;s sound in a more experimental electronic direction. Their final album, &quot;Six,&quot; was released in September 2019. Iris disbanded in 2021.

==History==

The band was initiated in 1993 as Forgiving Iris, with members Reagan Jones (vocals/keyboards), Matt Morris (keyboards/programming). The two had met in college and, influenced by artists such as Erasure and Depeche Mode, began playing covers locally in Austin, Texas. In 1998 they changed their name to Iris and released their debut full-length, &quot;Disconnect&quot;, which netted them &quot;Best Band&quot; and &quot;Best Album&quot; awards at the American Synthpop Awards in 2000. Its single &quot;Annie, Would I Lie To You?&quot; was one of the best-selling records in label A Different Drum’s history.

After several shows that followed, Reagan Jones and Matthew Morris started having arguments about their musical direction. Morris became focused on his personal life, and wasn&#x27;t interested into going back to the studio for the second album. Jones met Andrew Sega through the original singer of CTRL Joel Willard in 2001, and told him that he was looking for someone new to work with. Sega and Jones started working on some test tracks, the first of which would later become &quot;Unknown&quot;. They felt that the chemistry between the two worked out so well that they started working on the new record that would become &quot;Awakening&quot;. Sega added guitars and pushed the band&#x27;s sound into a more experimental electronic direction. They released their second album &quot;Awakening&quot; throughout Sega&#x27;s new label, Diffusion Records. Their next record, &quot;Wrath&quot; (2005) took a more aggressive approach. Its first single, &quot;Appetite&quot; went No. 1 on mainstream radio in Poland. A European tour followed, including festivals in Moscow and London.

In 2008, Iris released their first CD/DVD combo, &quot;Hydra&quot;. It featured 3 brand new tracks, as well as remixes from bands like Mesh, Alpinestars, Datguy, Benz &amp; MD, plus a 40 minute &quot;behind the scenes&quot; tour diary DVD.

In 2010, Iris released &quot;Blacklight&quot; through Infacted Recordings. After finishing its supporting tour in the U.S., the duo parted ways due to a tour argument. There was more than a year of silence between the band members, which ended when Jones sent Sega three demo songs.

In 2014, Iris signed with Dependent Records and released &quot;Radiant&quot; through the label, followed by &quot;Six&quot; in 2019.

Iris disbanded in September 2021. Dependent Records confirmed their split, saying that it was caused due to &quot;personal differences&quot;.

<text>Python (theatrically released in the Philippines as Anaconda 2000) is a 2000 made-for-TV horror film directed by Richard Clabaugh. The film features several cult favorite actors, including William Zabka of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; fame, Wil Wheaton, Casper Van Dien, Jenny McCarthy, Keith Coogan, Robert Englund, Dana Barron, David Bowe, and Sean Whalen.

The film concerns a genetically engineered snake, a python, that escapes and unleashes itself on a small town. It was filmed in Los Angeles and Malibu, California.

&quot;Python&quot; was followed by three sequels: &quot;Pythons 2&quot; (2002), &quot;New Alcatraz&quot; (also known as &quot;Boa&quot;) and &quot;Boa vs. Python&quot; (2004), all of which are also made-for-TV films.

==Plot==
A plane crashes near a town called Ruby after its cargo escapes. The cargo survives the crash and attacks Ruby&#x27;s citizens, starting with a lesbian couple, Lisa and Roberta, camping in the woods.

At a swimming hole the next day, John, his girlfriend Kristin, his best friend Tommy, and Tommy&#x27;s girlfriend Theresa find Lisa&#x27;s pet Burmese python, &quot;Lady G&quot;. Deputy Greg arrives, mentioning that Lisa is missing, and takes the snake. Lisa&#x27;s body is found, appearing to have been corroded by acids. Greg suspects John, since he works at a plant that uses acids.

Scientist Anton Rudolph meets with NSA Special Agent Parker. The cargo is an abnormally large, reticulated python genetically engineered in Southeast Asia, blending several species. In the words of Dr. Rudolph, it is, &quot;a perfect killing machine. A 129-foot all-terrain vehicle, capable of speeds exceeding 50 miles an hour, with skin that can deflect an antitank round, enhanced night vision, and a voracious appetite for human flesh&quot;. The NSA team plans an assault against the python.

The python kills a real estate agent and the agent&#x27;s client, leaving behind the client and Roberta&#x27;s bodies. John arrives as the python leaves, furthering suspicion against him. The sheriff shuts down his brother Brian&#x27;s plant. When the body of the real estate agent is found with the same acid damage, the sheriff orders John arrested.

The NSA team and Anton arrive, telling the sheriff a story about a psychotic rogue operative committing the murders. He does not believe them, but frees John. Kristin, Tommy, Theresa, and he plan to go on a trip the next morning.

The NSA set up base at a water treatment center. They use radar to find where the python is likely to be, then have the police set up a perimeter to keep people out of the zone. Believing the python to be sleeping, the team wastes most of its ammunition on the python&#x27;s shed skin. Agent Parker realizes the python used its skin as a decoy. The python kills the team, the sole survivor being Anton who keeps himself standing motionless in front of the creature.

Theresa&#x27;s morning shower is interrupted by the python. Though she escapes, the python eats Tommy. Theresa drives away, but the python follows. It gets in front of her and disables the truck. Theresa hides in a crevice.

When Tommy and Theresa do not arrive, John and Kristin go looking for them, finding the wrecked truck. Theresa tries warning them as the python approaches, but they cannot hear her. John and Kristin escape using Tommy and Theresa&#x27;s bikes from the truck. They make it to the water treatment center, where Theresa joins them, and find Anton in shock. The group realizes that they must do something about the python or it will get to the town. They call Greg on the radio and fill him in on a plan they have devised.

They lure the python into the water treatment plant by having it chase John through a shaft, while they set a bomb near the entrance. Kristin drops a line down another shaft for John to escape. They pull John out and the python is unable to climb up the shaft. Trapped in the tunnel, the python returns to the doorway entrance. The group returns to the entrance to trigger the bomb, but it does not detonate. Anton runs back in to reset it. Anton detonates the charges while confronted by the python, sacrificing himself. While the other four are celebrating their success, the python emerges unscathed.

The group flees in Greg&#x27;s police car, planning to penetrate the python&#x27;s hide by luring the python into a vat of acid at John&#x27;s plating plant. They are able to push the python&#x27;s underbelly into one of the vats, causing the python to be killed by the acid.

Six months later, Greg has been accepted into Quantico to be an FBI agent, the plant has been reopened as a bar/bike shop where the death of the python is used as a sales tool, and John finds out that Kristin and he are soon to be parents.

==Reception==
&quot;Python&quot; was originally broadcast in the United States on August 9, 2000. In the Philippines, the film was theatrically released as &quot;Anaconda 2000&quot; on October 25, 2000, connecting it to the unrelated 1997 film &quot;Anaconda&quot;.

&quot;Python&quot; received mixed reviews. Critics praised the ensemble cast, but criticized the special effects and plot. Others thought that it was an above-average television film with good special effects.

==Sequels==
&quot;Python&quot; had three sequels: 
*&quot;New Alcatraz&quot; (2002, also known as &quot;Boa&quot;) is about a giant prehistoric boa constrictor that is accidentally unleashed into a state-of-the-art prison in Antarctica, during a mining operation. The prison staff, the inmates, and two paleontologists must band together to escape the prison or become the serpent&#x27;s prey. The film was considered a critical failure. 
*&quot;Pythons 2&quot; (2002) has two carnivorous mutant pythons that terrorize a Russian research complex and military base; the Russians and the Americans must work together to destroy the creatures and save themselves.
*&quot;Boa vs. Python&quot; (2004), directed by David Flores, is a crossover between &quot;Python&quot; and &quot;Boa&quot;.

<doc id="645116" wikidata="Q1544340" url="?curid=645116" title="Mount Fairweather">
<text>Mount Fairweather (or &quot;Tsalxaan&quot; in the Tlingit language) is a mountain located east of the Pacific Ocean on the Canada–United States border. With an elevation of , it is the tallest mountain in British Columbia and the seventh-tallest mountain in Alaska. Most of the mountain lies within Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in the City and Borough of Yakutat, Alaska, though the summit borders Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park, British Columbia.

It is said this mountain and &quot;Yaas&#x27;éit&#x27;aa Shaa&quot; (Mt. St. Elias) were originally next to each other but had an argument and separated. Their children, the mountains in between the two peaks, are called &quot;Tsalxaan Yatx&#x27;i&quot; (Children of Tsalxaan.)

The colonial name for the mountain came from Captain James Cook, on May 3, 1778 apparently for the unusually good weather encountered at the time. The name has been translated into many languages. It was called &quot;Mt. Beautemps&quot; by La Perouse (1786, atlas), &quot;Mte. Buen-tiempo&quot; by Galiano (1802, map 3), &quot;Gor[a]-Khoroshy-pogody&quot; on Russian Hydrographic Dept. Chart 1378 in 1847, and &quot;G[ora] Fayerveder&quot; by Captain Tebenkov (1852, map 7), Imperial Russian Navy. It was called &quot;Schönwetterberg&quot; by Constantin Grewingk in 1850 and &quot;Schönwetter Berg&quot; by Justus Perthes in 1882.

Fairweather was first climbed in 1931 by Allen Carpé and Terris Moore.

==Geography==
Mount Fairweather is located right above Glacier Bay in the Fairweather Range of the Saint Elias Mountains. Mount Fairweather also marks the northwest extremity of the Alaska Panhandle.

Like many peaks in the St. Elias Mountains, Mount Fairweather has great vertical relief due to its dramatic rise from Glacier Bay. However, due to poor weather in the area, this effect is usually obscured with the clouds which often hides the summit from view.

==Weather==
Despite its name, Mount Fairweather has generally harsh weather conditions. It receives over 100 inches (254 cm) of precipitation each year (mostly snow) and sees temperatures of around .

==Climbing history==
No documented attempt at climbing the mountain had been successful until 1931.
* 1926 Allen Carpe, Andy Taylor and W.S. Ladd reached on the West Ridge, but were forced back due to a steep notch in the ridge that made ferrying supplies very difficult.
* 1930 Bradford Washburn also made an attempt on the West Ridge but traveling conditions forced a retreat at .
* 1931 Allen Carpe and Terris Moore summited via the &quot;Southeast Ridge&quot; on June 8, 1931
* 1958 Paddy Sherman and 7 other Canadians reached the summit via the &quot;SE Ridge&quot; on June 26, 1958.
* 1968 &quot;West Ridge&quot;, Loren Adkins, Walter Gove, Paul Myhre, John Neal and Kent Stokes – summit reached June 12, 1968
* 1973 &quot;Southwest Ridge&quot;, Peter Metcalf, Henry Florschutz, Toby O&#x27;Brien and Lincoln Stoller. Summit reached on July 10, 1973.
* 1981 &quot;Southeast Ridge from the ocean&quot;, Gary Clark, Kim Grandfield, David Lunn. 19 days from Sea Otter Beach and back, Summit reached on May 31, bivouac in crevasse under summit.

===First Documented Ascent===

After failing to reach the summit in 1926 due to terrain difficulty on their chosen route, Allen Carpe, W.S. Ladd, Andy Taylor returned in 1931 along with a new member Terris Moore. In early April the group began their approach by boat but stormy weather delayed them rounding Cape Fairweather until April 17. They reached Lituya Bay and unloaded their supplies on the beach. Backtracking along the coast, they made their way to the Fairweather Glacier. From base camp in a spot they called Paradise Valley, they decided to attempt the mountain from the south rather than via the west ridge. Due to deep snow, they realized that skis and snowshoes would be of great help so Carpe and Moore made the round trip to fetch them from Lituya Bay.

They ascended the glacier from base camp and setup camp at on the mountain&#x27;s south face. On May 25, they established high camp at after making significant progress up a ridge on a rare day of good weather. However, the weather turned and they were forced to descend after an overnight coating of snow. After waiting out the snowstorm for six days at lower camp, they made their way back up to high camp on June 2. They left for the summit at 1:30 am on June 3 and having reached the southeast shoulder by mid-morning, they were feeling so confident that they left the willow wands behind. However, higher altitude and the weeks of hard effort slowed their progress and then the weather changed. By 1 pm not far from the summit, they decided to retreat and had to descend without the wands to guide them. They managed to reach the tents by 4 pm. Ladd and Taylor volunteered to descend due to dwindling supplies at high camp with the hope that Carpe and Moore would be able to make another attempt in good weather. The storm raged for four days before it finally cleared in the evening on June 7. At 10 pm, Carpe and Moore set out for the summit and with no further difficulties made it to the top.

<text>Neuroethology is the evolutionary and comparative approach to the study of animal behavior and its underlying mechanistic control by the nervous system. It is an interdisciplinary science that combines both neuroscience (study of the nervous system) and ethology (study of animal behavior in natural conditions). A central theme of neuroethology, which differentiates it from other branches of neuroscience, is its focus on behaviors that have been favored by natural selection (e.g., finding mates, navigation, locomotion, and predator avoidance) rather than on behaviors that are specific to a particular disease state or laboratory experiment.

Neuroethologists hope to uncover general principles of the nervous system from the study of animals with exaggerated or specialized behaviors. They endeavor to understand how the nervous system translates biologically relevant stimuli into natural behavior. For example, many bats are capable of echolocation which is used for prey capture and navigation. The auditory system of bats is often cited as an example for how acoustic properties of sounds can be converted into a sensory map of behaviorally relevant features of sounds.

==Philosophy==
Neuroethology is an integrative approach to the study of animal behavior that draws upon several disciplines. Its approach stems from the theory that animals&#x27; nervous systems have evolved to address problems of sensing and acting in certain environmental niches and that their nervous systems are best understood in the context of the problems they have evolved to solve. In accordance with Krogh&#x27;s principle, neuroethologists often study animals that are &quot;specialists&quot; in the behavior the researcher wishes to study e.g. honeybees and social behavior, bat echolocation, owl sound localization, etc.

The scope of neuroethological inquiry might be summarized by Jörg-Peter Ewert, a pioneer of neuroethology, when he considers the types of questions central to neuroethology in his 1980 introductory text to the field:

# How are stimuli detected by an organism?
# How are environmental stimuli in the external world represented in the nervous system?
# How is information about a stimulus acquired, stored and recalled by the nervous system?
# How is a behavioral pattern encoded by neural networks?
# How is behavior coordinated and controlled by the nervous system?
# How can the ontogenetic development of behavior be related to neural mechanisms?

Often central to addressing questions in neuroethology are comparative methodologies, drawing upon knowledge about related organisms&#x27; nervous systems, anatomies, life histories, behaviors and environmental niches. While it is not unusual for many types of neurobiology experiments to give rise to behavioral questions, many neuroethologists often begin their research programs by observing a species&#x27; behavior in its natural environment. Other approaches to understanding nervous systems include the systems identification approach, popular in engineering. The idea is to stimulate the system using a non-natural stimulus with certain properties. The system&#x27;s response to the stimulus may be used to analyze the operation of the system. Such an approach is useful for linear systems, but the nervous system is notoriously nonlinear, and neuroethologists argue that such an approach is limited. This argument is supported by experiments in the auditory system, which show that neural responses to complex sounds, like social calls, can not be predicted by the knowledge gained from studying the responses due to pure tones (one of the non-natural stimuli favored by auditory neurophysiologists). This is because of the non-linearity of the system.

Modern neuroethology is largely influenced by the research techniques used. Neural approaches are necessarily very diverse, as is evident through the variety of questions asked, measuring techniques used, relationships explored, and model systems employed. Techniques utilized since 1984 include the use of intracellular dyes, which make maps of identified neurons possible, and the use of brain slices, which bring vertebrate brains into better observation through intracellular electrodes (Hoyle 1984). Currently, other fields toward which neuroethology may be headed include computational neuroscience, molecular genetics, neuroendocrinology and epigenetics. The existing field of neural modeling may also expand into neuroethological terrain, due to its practical uses in robotics. In all this, neuroethologists must use the right level of simplicity to effectively guide research towards accomplishing the goals of neuroethology.

Critics of neuroethology might consider it a branch of neuroscience concerned with &#x27;animal trivia&#x27;. Though neuroethological subjects tend not to be traditional neurobiological model systems (i.e. &quot;Drosophila&quot;, &quot;C. elegans&quot;, or &quot;Danio rerio&quot;), neuroethological approaches emphasizing comparative methods have uncovered many concepts central to neuroscience as a whole, such as lateral inhibition, coincidence detection, and sensory maps. The discipline of neuroethology has also discovered and explained the only vertebrate behavior for which the entire neural circuit has been described: the electric fish jamming avoidance response. Beyond its conceptual contributions, neuroethology makes indirect contributions to advancing human health. By understanding simpler nervous systems, many clinicians have used concepts uncovered by neuroethology and other branches of neuroscience to develop treatments for devastating human diseases.

==History==

Neuroethology owes part of its existence to the establishment of ethology as a unique discipline within zoology. Although animal behavior had been studied since the time of Aristotle (384–342 BC), it was not until the early twentieth century that ethology finally became distinguished from natural science (a strictly descriptive field) and ecology. The main catalysts behind this new distinction were the research and writings of Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen.

Konrad Lorenz was born in Austria in 1903, and is widely known for his contribution of the theory of fixed action patterns (FAPs): endogenous, instinctive behaviors involving a complex sequence of movements that are triggered (&quot;released&quot;) by a certain kind of stimulus. This sequence always proceeds to completion, even if the original stimulus is removed. It is also species-specific and performed by nearly all members. Lorenz constructed his famous &quot;hydraulic model&quot; to help illustrate this concept, as well as the concept of action specific energy, or drives.

Niko Tinbergen was born in the Netherlands in 1907 and worked closely with Lorenz in the development of the FAP theory; their studies focused on the egg retrieval response of nesting geese. Tinbergen performed extensive research on the releasing mechanisms of particular FAPs, and used the bill-pecking behavior of baby herring gulls as his model system. This led to the concept of the supernormal stimulus. Tinbergen is also well known for his four questions that he believed ethologists should be asking about any given animal behavior; among these is that of the mechanism of the behavior, on a physiological, neural and molecular level, and this question can be thought of in many regards as the keystone question in neuroethology. Tinbergen also emphasized the need for ethologists and neurophysiologists to work together in their studies, a unity that has become a reality in the field of neuroethology.

Unlike behaviorism, which studies animals&#x27; reactions to non-natural stimuli in artificial, laboratory conditions, ethology sought to categorize and analyze the natural behaviors of animals in a field setting. Similarly, neuroethology asks questions about the neural bases of &quot;naturally occurring&quot; behaviors, and seeks to mimic the natural context as much as possible in the laboratory.

Although the development of ethology as a distinct discipline was crucial to the advent of neuroethology, equally important was the development of a more comprehensive understanding of neuroscience. Contributors to this new understanding were the Spanish Neuroanatomist, Ramon y Cajal (born in 1852), and physiologists Charles Sherrington, Edgar Adrian, Alan Hodgkin, and Andrew Huxley. Charles Sherrington, who was born in Great Britain in 1857, is famous for his work on the nerve synapse as the site of transmission of nerve impulses, and for his work on reflexes in the spinal cord. His research also led him to hypothesize that every muscular activation is coupled to an inhibition of the opposing muscle. He was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work in 1932 along with Lord Edgar Adrian who made the first physiological recordings of neural activity from single nerve fibers.

Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley (born 1914 and 1917, respectively, in Great Britain), are known for their collaborative effort to understand the production of action potentials in the giant axons of squid. The pair also proposed the existence of ion channels to facilitate action potential initiation, and were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1963 for their efforts.

As a result of this pioneering research, many scientists then sought to connect the physiological aspects of the nervous and sensory systems to specific behaviors. These scientists – Karl von Frisch, Erich von Holst, and Theodore Bullock – are frequently referred to as the &quot;fathers&quot; of neuroethology. Neuroethology did not really come into its own, though, until the 1970s and 1980s, when new, sophisticated experimental methods allowed researchers such as Masakazu Konishi, Walter Heiligenberg, Jörg-Peter Ewert, and others to study the neural circuits underlying verifiable behavior.

==Modern neuroethology==

The International Society for Neuroethology represents the present discipline of neuroethology, which was founded on the occasion of the NATO-Advanced Study Institute &quot;Advances in Vertebrate Neuroethology&quot; (August 13–24, 1981) organized by J.-P. Ewert, D.J. Ingle and R.R. Capranica, held at the University of Kassel in Hofgeismar, Germany (cf. report Trends in Neurosci. 5:141-143,1982). Its first president was Theodore H. Bullock. The society has met every three years since its first meeting in Tokyo in 1986.

Its membership draws from many research programs around the world; many of its members are students and faculty members from medical schools and neurobiology departments from various universities. Modern advances in neurophysiology techniques have enabled more exacting approaches in an ever-increasing number of animal systems, as size limitations are being dramatically overcome. Survey of the most recent (2007) congress of the ISN meeting symposia topics gives some idea of the field&#x27;s breadth:

*Comparative aspects of spatial memory (rodents, birds, humans, bats)
*Influences of higher processing centers in active sensing (primates, owls, electric fish, rodents, frogs)
*Animal signaling plasticity over many time scales (electric fish, frogs, birds)
*Song production and learning in passerine birds
*Primate sociality
*Optimal function of sensory systems (flies, moths, frogs, fish)
*Neuronal complexity in behavior (insects, computational)
*Contributions of genes to behavior (Drosophila, honeybees, zebrafish)
*Eye and head movement (crustaceans, humans, robots)
*Hormonal actions in brain and behavior (rodents, primates, fish, frogs, and birds)
*Cognition in insects (honeybee)

==Application to technology==

Neuroethology can help create advancements in technology through an advanced understanding of animal behavior. Model systems were generalized from the study of simple and related animals to humans. For example, the neuronal cortical space map discovered in bats, a specialized champion of hearing and navigating, elucidated the concept of a computational space map. In addition, the discovery of the space map in the barn owl led to the first neuronal example of the Jeffress model. This understanding is translatable to understanding spatial localization in humans, a mammalian relative of the bat. Today, knowledge learned from neuroethology are being applied in new technologies. For example, Randall Beer and his colleagues used algorithms learned from insect walking behavior to create robots designed to walk on uneven surfaces (Beer et al.). Neuroethology and technology contribute to one another bidirectionally.

Neuroethologists seek to understand the neural basis of a behavior as it would occur in an animal&#x27;s natural environment but the techniques for neurophysiological analysis are lab-based, and cannot be performed in the field setting. This dichotomy between field and lab studies poses a challenge for neuroethology. From the neurophysiology perspective, experiments must be designed for controls and objective rigor, which contrasts with the ethology perspective – that the experiment be applicable to the animal&#x27;s natural condition, which is uncontrolled, or subject to the dynamics of the environment. An early example of this is when Walter Rudolf Hess developed focal brain stimulation technique to examine a cat&#x27;s brain controls of vegetative functions in addition to other behaviors. Even though this was a breakthrough in technological abilities and technique, it was not used by many neuroethologists originally because it compromised a cat&#x27;s natural state, and, therefore, in their minds, devalued the experiments&#x27; relevance to real situations.

When intellectual obstacles like this were overcome, it led to a golden age of neuroethology, by focusing on simple and robust forms of behavior, and by applying modern neurobiological methods to explore the entire chain of sensory and neural mechanisms underlying these behaviors (Zupanc 2004). New technology allows neuroethologists to attach electrodes to even very sensitive parts of an animal such as its brain while it interacts with its environment. The founders of neuroethology ushered this understanding and incorporated technology and creative experimental design. Since then even indirect technological advancements such as battery-powered and waterproofed instruments have allowed neuroethologists to mimic natural conditions in the lab while they study behaviors objectively.
In addition, the electronics required for amplifying neural signals and for transmitting them over a certain distance have enabled neuroscientists to record from behaving animals performing activities in naturalistic environments. Emerging technologies can complement neuroethology, augmenting the feasibility of this valuable perspective of natural neurophysiology.

Another challenge, and perhaps part of the beauty of neuroethology, is experimental design. The value of neuroethological criteria speak to the reliability of these experiments, because these discoveries represent behavior in the environments in which they evolved. Neuroethologists foresee future advancements through using new technologies and techniques, such as computational neuroscience, neuroendocrinology, and molecular genetics that mimic natural environments.

==Case studies==

===Jamming avoidance response===
In 1963, Akira Watanabe and Kimihisa Takeda discovered the behavior of the jamming avoidance response in the knifefish &quot;Eigenmannia&quot; sp. In collaboration with T.H. Bullock and colleagues, the behavior was further developed. Finally, the work of W. Heiligenberg expanded it into a full neuroethology study by examining the series of neural connections that led to the behavior. &quot;Eigenmannia&quot; is a weakly electric fish that can generate electric discharges through electrocytes in its tail. Furthermore, it has the ability to electrolocate by analyzing the perturbations in its electric field. However, when the frequency of a neighboring fish&#x27;s current is very close (less than 20 Hz difference) to that of its own, the fish will avoid having their signals interfere through a behavior known as Jamming Avoidance Response. If the neighbor&#x27;s frequency is higher than the fish&#x27;s discharge frequency, the fish will lower its frequency, and vice versa. The sign of the frequency difference is determined by analyzing the &quot;beat&quot; pattern of the incoming interference which consists of the combination of the two fish&#x27;s discharge patterns.

Neuroethologists performed several experiments under &quot;Eigenmannia&quot;″s natural conditions to study how it determined the sign of the frequency difference. They manipulated the fish&#x27;s discharge by injecting it with curare which prevented its natural electric organ from discharging. Then, an electrode was placed in its mouth and another was placed at the tip of its tail. Likewise, the neighboring fish&#x27;s electric field was mimicked using another set of electrodes. This experiment allowed neuroethologists to manipulate different discharge frequencies and observe the fish&#x27;s behavior. From the results, they were able to conclude that the electric field frequency, rather than an internal frequency measure, was used as a reference. This experiment is significant in that not only does it reveal a crucial neural mechanism underlying the behavior but also demonstrates the value neuroethologists place on studying animals in their natural habitats.

===Feature analysis in toad vision===

The recognition of prey and predators in the toad was first studied in depth by Jörg-Peter Ewert (Ewert 1974; see also 2004). He began by observing the natural prey-catching behavior of the common toad (&quot;Bufo bufo&quot;) and concluded that the animal followed a sequence that consisted of stalking, binocular fixation, snapping, swallowing and mouth-wiping. However, initially, the toad&#x27;s actions were dependent on specific features of the sensory stimulus: whether it demonstrated worm or anti-worm configurations. It was observed that the worm configuration, which signaled prey, was initiated by movement along the object&#x27;s long axis, whereas anti-worm configuration, which signaled predator, was due to movement along the short axis. (Zupanc 2004).

Ewert and coworkers adopted a variety of methods to study the predator versus prey behavior response. They conducted recording experiments where they inserted electrodes into the brain, while the toad was presented with worm or anti-worm stimuli. This technique was repeated at different levels of the visual system and also allowed feature detectors to be identified. In focus was the discovery of prey-selective neurons in the optic tectum, whose axons could be traced towards the snapping pattern generating cells in the hypoglossal nucleus. The discharge patterns of prey-selective tectal neurons in response to prey objects – in freely moving toads – &quot;predicted&quot; prey-catching reactions such as snapping. Another approach, called stimulation experiment, was carried out in freely moving toads. Focal electrical stimuli were applied to different regions of the brain, and the toad&#x27;s response was observed. When the thalamic-pretectal region was stimulated, the toad exhibited escape responses, but when the tectum was stimulated in an area close to prey-selective neurons, the toad engaged in prey catching behavior (Carew 2000). Furthermore, neuroanatomical experiments were carried out where the toad&#x27;s thalamic-pretectal/tectal connection was lesioned and the resulting deficit noted: the prey-selective properties were abolished both in the responses of prey-selective neurons and in the prey catching behavior. These and other experiments suggest that prey selectivity results from pretecto-tectal influences.

Ewert and coworkers showed in toads that there are stimulus-response mediating pathways that translate perception (of visual sign stimuli) into action (adequate behavioral responses). In addition there are modulatory loops that initiate, modify or specify this mediation (Ewert 2004). Regarding the latter, for example, the telencephalic caudal ventral striatum is involved in a loop gating the stimulus-response mediation in a manner of directed attention. The telencephalic ventral medial pallium („primordium hippocampi&quot;), however, is involved in loops that either modify prey-selection due to associative learning or specify prey-selection due to non-associative learning, respectively.

==Computational neuroethology==

Computational neuroethology (CN or CNE)
is concerned with the computer modelling of the neural mechanisms underlying animal behaviors. Together with the term &quot;artificial ethology,&quot; the term &quot;computational neuroethology&quot; was first published in literature by Achacoso and Yamamoto in the Spring of 1990, based on their pioneering work on the connectome of C. elegans in 1989, with further publications in 1992. Computational neuroethology was argued for in depth later in 1990 by Randall Beer and by Dave Cliff both of whom acknowledged the strong influence of Michael Arbib&#x27;s &quot;Rana Computatrix&quot; computational model of neural mechanisms for visual guidance in frogs and toads.

CNE systems work within a closed-loop environment; that is, they perceive their (perhaps artificial) environment directly, rather than through human input, as is typical in AI systems. For example, Barlow et al. developed a time-dependent model for the retina of the horseshoe crab &quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot; on a Connection Machine (Model CM-2). Instead of feeding the model retina with idealized input signals, they exposed the simulation to digitized video sequences made underwater, and compared its response with those of real animals.

<doc id="645125" wikidata="Q210369" url="?curid=645125" title="Paleozoology">
<text>Palaeozoology, also spelled as Paleozoology (Greek: , &quot;palaeon&quot; &quot;old&quot; and , &quot;zoon&quot; &quot;animal&quot;), is the branch of paleontology, paleobiology, or zoology dealing with the recovery and identification of multicellular animal remains from geological (or even archeological) contexts, and the use of these fossils in the reconstruction of prehistoric environments and ancient ecosystems.

Definitive, macroscopic remains of these metazoans are found in the fossil record from the Ediacaran period of the Neoproterozoic era onwards, although they do not become common until the Late Devonian period in the latter half of the Paleozoic era. 

Perhaps the best known macrofossils group is the dinosaurs. Other popularly known animal-derived macrofossils include trilobites, crustaceans, echinoderms, brachiopods, mollusks, bony fishes, sharks, Vertebrate teeth, and shells of numerous invertebrate groups. This is because hard organic parts, such as bones, teeth, and shells resist decay, and are the most commonly preserved and found animal fossils. Exclusively soft-bodied animals—such as jellyfish, flatworms, nematodes, and insects—are consequently rarely fossilized, as these groups do not produce hard organic parts.

== Vertebrate paleozoology ==
Vertebrate paleozoology refers to the use of morphological, temporal, and stratigraphic data to map vertebrate history in evolutionary theory. Vertebrates are classified as a subphylum of Chordata, a phylum used to classify species adhering to a rod-shaped, flexible body type called a notochord. They differ from other phyla in that other phyla may have cartilage or cartilage-like tissues forming a sort of skeleton, but only vertebrates possess what we define as bone.

Classes of vertebrates listed in chronological order from oldest to most recent include heterostracans, osteostracans, coelolepid agnathans, acanthodians, osteichthyan fishes, chondrichthyan fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. All vertebrates are studied under standard evolutionary generalizations of behavior and life process, although there is controversy over whether population can be accurately estimated from limited fossil resources.

Evolutionary origins of vertebrates as well as the phylum Chordata have not been scientifically determined. Many believe vertebrates diverged from a common ancestor of chordates and echinoderms. This belief is well supported by the prehistoric marine creature Amphioxus. Amphioxus does not possess bone, making it an invertebrate, but it has common features with vertebrates including a segmented body and a notochord. This could imply that Amphioxus is a transitional form between an early chordate, echinoderm or common ancestor, and vertebrates.

== Quantitative paleozoology ==
Quantitative paleozoology is a process of taking a census of fossil types rather than inventory. They differ in that inventory refers to a detailed log of individual fossils, whereas census attempts to group individual fossils to tally the total number of a species. This information can be used to determine which species were most dominant and which had the largest population at a time period or in a geological region.

In the early 1930s, paleontologists Chester Stock and Hildegarde Howard devised special units for quantitative paleozoology and quantitative paleontology. The first unit used, Number of Identified Species (NISP), specified exact quantity of fossils from a specific species recorded. Stock and Howard determined this unit to be problematic for quantitative purposes as an excess of a small fossil—such as teeth—could exaggerate quantity of the species. There was also an amount of confusion as to whether bone fragments should be assembled and counted as one bone or tallied individually. Stock and Howard then devised the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI), which estimated the minimum number of animals needed to produce the fossils recorded. For example, if five scapulae from a species were found, it might be difficult to determine whether some of them were paired right and left on one individual or whether each came from a different individual, which could alter census, but it could be said that there must be at least three individuals to produce five scapulae. Three would thus be the MNI. In rare cases where enough of a collection of fossils can be assembled into individuals as to provide an accurate number of individuals, the unit used is Actual Number of Individuals, or ANI.

Another unit commonly used in quantitative paleozoology is biomass. Biomass is defined as the amount of tissue in an area or from a species. It is calculated by estimating an average weight based on similar modern species and multiplying it by the MNI. This yields an estimate of how much the entire population of a species may have weighed. Problems with this measurement include the difference in weight between youngsters and adults, seasonal weight changes due to diet and hibernation, and the difficulty of accurately estimating the weight of a creature with only a skeletal reference. It is also difficult to determine exact age of fossilized matter within a year or a decade, so a biomass might be grossly exaggerated or under exaggerated if the estimated time frame in which the fossils were alive is incorrect.

A similar measurement to biomass is meat weight. To determine meat weight, MNI is multiplied by the amount of meat an individual is thought to have provided, then multiplied by the percentage of that meat thought to be edible. This gives an estimate of &quot;pounds of usable meat&quot; per individual which might have been harvested by prehistoric hunters. For example, a male Wapiti has an average weight of 400 kg, and in a particular study, the MNI of Wapiti was found to be 10. This would create a biomass of 4,000 kg. If the amount of edible meat is estimated at 50 percent, this would result in a meat weight of 2,000 kg. The biggest problem with this method is the debate over &quot;percent of usable meat.&quot; Different views on which parts of a species are edible and which are not as well as whether or not primitive butchers would have been able to access and prepare different parts have led to controversy.

== Conservation biology ==
Paleozoological data is used in research concerning conservation biology. Conservation biology refers to biological study used for conservation, control, and preservation of various species and ecosystems. In this context, the paleozoological data used is obtained from recently deceased decomposing matter rather than prehistoric matter.

R. Lee Lyman, Professor and Chair Department of Anthropology at the University of Missouri, writes that paleozoological research can provide data such as extinction rates and causes and &quot;benchmark&quot; peaks and drops in population which can be used to predict future patterns and to design maximally effective methods of controlling these patterns. In addition, paleozoological data can be used to compare current to former population and distribution of a species.

<text>The Dungeness nuclear power stations are a pair of non-operational nuclear power stations located on the Dungeness headland in the south of Kent, England.

Dungeness A is a legacy Magnox power station consisting of two 250MWe reactors which were connected to the National Grid in 1965 and reached its end of life in 2006.

Dungeness B is an advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) power station consisting of two 520MWe reactors, which began operation in 1983 and 1985. They were the first in a series of AGR reactors to be constructed across the UK. In March 2009, unexpected problems discovered during a maintenance shutdown on unit B21 resulted in the reactor remaining offline for nearly 18 months. In 2015, the plant received upgrades and was given a second ten-year life extension to 2028. In September 2018, as both units were shut down for a scheduled maintenance outage, EDF encountered &quot;significant and ongoing technical challenges&quot; which ultimately led to the announcement of its closure on 7 June 2021.

==Dungeness A==

Dungeness A is a legacy Magnox power station that was connected to the National Grid in 1965 and has reached the end of its life. It possessed two nuclear reactors producing 219MW of electricity each, with a total capacity of 438MW. The construction was undertaken by a consortium known as the Nuclear Power Group (&#x27;TNPG&#x27;). The reactors were supplied by TNPG and the turbines by C. A. Parsons &amp; Co. There were originally four × 142.5MW turbo-alternators, these were later down-rated to 106MW machines. Steam pressure and temperature at the turbine stop valves was and .

Nuclear fuel for Dungeness power stations can be delivered and removed via a crane loading facility at the end of the Appledore-Lydd-Dungeness branch railway. This is connected to the Ashford to Hastings line via an east-facing junction located to the west of Appledore station. The close proximity of the Appledore-Lydd-Dungeness branch to the nuclear power stations allow for a more direct route to and from major fuel fabrication sites all whilst minimising the use of road convoys thus lowering traffic impact on nearby communities.

===Closure and decommissioning===
On 31 December 2006, Dungeness A ceased power generation after over 40 years of operation. Defuelling was completed in June 2012, with all fuel having been sent to Sellafield for reprocessing. After the site was declared fuel-free, demolition works accelerated beginning with the demolition of the turbine hall in June 2015. Similar to other legacy Magnox stations, the site will undergo decommissioning where radiologically contaminated equipment is removed and redundant structures demolished. Once complete, the reactor buildings will be re-cladded to ensure they are able to remain an effective barrier to the elements and the facility will enter a &#x27;care and maintenance&#x27; stage.

The care and maintenance stage is part of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) decommissioning strategy and spans an 80+ year period. This waiting period allows for radiation levels within the reactor core to decline and helps to facilitate a smoother demolition process. Dungeness A is due to enter the care and maintenance phase in 2027. Demolition of reactor buildings and final site clearance is planned for 2088 to 2098.
The ongoing decommissioning process is being managed by Magnox Ltd, a subsidiary of the NDA.

== Dungeness B ==

Dungeness B is an advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) power station consisting of two 1,496MWt reactors, which began operation in 1983 and 1985 respectively. Dungeness B was the first commercial scale AGR power station to be constructed. Its design was based on the much smaller Windscale AGR prototype, the WAGR. The £89million contract was awarded in August 1965 to Atomic Power Construction (&#x27;APC&#x27;), a consortium backed by Crompton Parkinson, Fairey Engineering, International Combustion and Richardsons Westgarth. The completion date was set as 1970.

During construction, many problems were encountered in scaling up the WAGR design. Problems with the construction of the pressure vessel liner had distorted it, so that the boilers, which were to fit in an annular space between the reactor and the pressure vessel, could not be installed, and the liner had to be partially dismantled and rebuilt. This work cost about £200,000, but there was a huge cost of financing an extra 18 unproductive months for a power station costing around £100million, of which 60% was already complete. Serious problems were also discovered with the design of the boilers, which had to withstand the pounding of hot carbon dioxide (), pressurised to and pumped around the reactor coolant circuit by massive gas circulators. As a consequence, the casings, hangers and tube supports all had to be redesigned. The cost of the modifications, and financing during the delays, caused severe financial pressures for the consortium and its backers, and in 1969 APC collapsed into administration.

The CEGB took over project management, imposed light penalties in order not to cripple Fairey and International Combustion, and appointed British Nuclear Design and Construction (BNDC) as main contractor. In 1971, problems with corrosion of mild steel components in the first generation Magnox reactors gave the designers cause for concern. The Dungeness B restraint couplings - mechanical linkages that held the graphite core in place whilst allowing it to expand and contract in response to temperature changes - were made of mild steel and could be subject to the same corrosion. It was decided to replace them with components made from a new material. In 1972, problems were found with the galvanised wire that was used to attach thermocouples to stainless steel boiler tubes. During heat treatment of the tubes at temperatures up to , the galvanising zinc diffused into the tubes and made them brittle. The cost had by then risen to £170million. By 1975, the CEGB was reporting that the power station would not be completed until 1977 and that its cost had risen to £280million. 
By 1979, the cost had risen further to £410million.

Reactor 1 first generated power on 3 April 1983, 13 years behind schedule and at a cost of £685million, four times the initial estimate in inflation-adjusted terms. The original construction consortium had collapsed.

As with the &quot;A&quot; station, the turbines were built by C.A. Parsons &amp; Company and the station has two 660MWe turbo-alternator sets, producing a maximum output of 1,320MWe, though net output is 1,090MWe after the effects of house load, and downrating the reactor output due to corrosion and vibration concerns.

In 2005, the station&#x27;s closure date was extended from 2008 by ten years, which would allow it to continue operating until 2018, 35 years after first power generation.

In March 2009, serious problems were found when Unit 21 was shut down for maintenance, and the reactor remained out of action for almost 18 months. On 24 November 2009, a small fire in the boiler annexe of Unit 22 caused the second reactor to be shut down as well. Subsequently, Unit 22 has been intermittently shut down for up to several months at a time. Unit 21 was restarted in August 2010. Unplanned shutdowns continued into 2011, with 21 down for repairs from November 2011 to March 2012.

In 2015, the plant was given another ten-year life extension, allowing an upgrade to control room computer systems and improved flood defences, taking the accounting closure date to 2028.

=== Electricity output ===
In 2015, Dungeness B produced 4.4TWh of energy. The operators claimed that this amounted to a saving of 3.4million tonnes of CO2.

=== Decommissioning ===
In September 2018, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) directed that EDF Energy carry out a reassessment of corrosion of safety-related concealed systems. Inspections showed that seismic restraints, pipework and storage vessels were found to be &quot;corroded to an unacceptable condition&quot;, and that would have been the state when the reactor was operating. Remedial measures included the upgrading of more than of pipeline and of carbon dioxide storage vessels. The ONR classified this as a level 2 incident on the International Nuclear Event Scale. Dungeness B was initially expected to return to service in February 2019, later put back to 30 September 2019 to complete inspections. In August 2020, the shut down of units B21 and B22 was extended to December 2020 after being taken offline in September 2018.

On 7 June 2021, EDF announced that Dungeness B would not be restarted and would move into the defuelling phase immediately, once regulatory permissions are granted, citing &quot;station-specific risks within some key components, including parts within the fuel assemblies&quot; identified since September 2018.

EDF has estimated the cost of defuelling Dungeness B at £0.5£1.0billion, with the process expected to take up to ten years. A UK Parliament committee report noted that the cost of decommissioning is shouldered in part by UK taxpayers.

==Consideration of Dungeness C==
On 15 April 2009, Dungeness was included in a list of 11 potential sites for new nuclear power stations, at the request of EDF Energy, which owns and operates Dungeness B. The government did not include Dungeness C in its draft National Policy Statement published on 9 November 2009, citing environmental reasons and concerns about coastal erosion and associated flood risk. The site was ruled out by Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Chris Huhne in October 2010, with the former government&#x27;s list of eleven potential sites reduced to eight. Despite these environmental concerns, local Conservative MP Damian Collins, supported by some residents, lobbied Parliament to reconsider that position.

==HVDC station==
From 1961 to 1984, Dungeness power station also housed the mercury arc valves of the static inverter plant converting AC into DC for transmission on HVDC Cross-Channel, the high-voltage direct current power cable carrying electric power across the English Channel to France. In 1983, a more powerful new inverter at Sellindge replaced this facility.

==Ownership==
Both stations were originally built, owned, and operated by the CEGB. Following privatisation of the electricity supply industry and the later part-privatisation of the nuclear power generating industry they are now owned by two different bodies: the original Magnox station Dungeness A by the non-departmental government body the NDA and newer AGR Dungeness B by EDF Energy.

==Location==
The stations are built on a large area of open shingle, measuring , which has been deposited by the sea and built up over thousands of years. The entire area is moving slowly north and east as the sea moves the shingle from one side of the headland to the other. It is surrounded by a nature reserve Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A fleet of lorries is used to continuously maintain shingle sea defences for the plant as coastal erosion would otherwise move shingle away at an estimated rate of per year. Around of shingle are moved each year. It seems that deposition on the north shore of the headland does not keep pace with erosion, although the power stations are about to the west of that shore. In all, are moved each year along parts of the coast between Pett Level and Hythe. This is necessary for the safety of the entire area including the power stations. During operation, around of cooling water was extracted and returned to the sea each hour, after being heated by .

The headland and the coastline between Pett Level and Hythe are volatile. In recorded history Walland Marsh to the west of the power stations has been flooded. In the space of sixty years severe inundation occurred, temporarily bringing the sea inland to Appledore and the original mouth of the River Rother from north of the headland at Romney to the south at Rye Harbour. The site is a few metres above Mean Sea Level and would be isolated in the event of flooding of the magnitude that submerged large areas of East Anglia and the Netherlands in 1953. It has been conjectured that the Great Storm of 1987 did not bring the sea to the stations because there was a low tide at the time. Climate change could cause more frequent and powerful storms, and associated waves and surges are possible though not probable, and might increase the instability of the headland.

===In the media===
The station was used in the filming of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Claws of Axos&quot; in January 1971.

The site provides a key plot point in the 2016 book, &quot;Alan Partridge: Nomad&quot;.

The station is within sight of artist Derek Jarman&#x27;s garden at Prospect Cottage. The film &quot;The Garden&quot; was filmed at the house, and it was the main subject of an episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Countryfile&quot; in February 2020.

Dungeness B appears on the album sleeve for the 1980 album &quot;Sound Affects&quot; by The Jam.

<text>Mount Caubvick (known as Mont D&#x27;Iberville in Quebec) is a mountain located in Canada on the border between Labrador and Quebec in the Selamiut Range of the Torngat Mountains. It is the highest point in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and mainland Canada east of the Rockies. The mountain contains a massive peak that rises sharply from nearby sea level. Craggy ridges, steep cirques and glaciers are prominent features of the peak.

The alp was named Mont D&#x27;Iberville by the Quebec government in 1971. It remained nameless on the Labrador side for several years; it became known unofficially as L1, L for Labrador and 1 for highest. In 1981, at the suggestion of Dr. Peter Neary, the provincial government named the mountain after Caubvick, one of the five Inuit who accompanied George Cartwright to England in 1772.

Mount Caubvick also hosts the highest point in both the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec, although the summit itself lies about northeast of the Quebec provincial border and is entirely within Labrador.

==Climbing==
Due to difficult access (either via bush plane or boat) and unpredictable, snowy weather at any time of the year, there is no easy way to the top. The summit can be gained from the east by the Minaret Ridge or to the west by the Koroc Ridge. The final sections on both routes become technical in nature.

American climbers Michael Adler and Christopher Goetze were the first to scale the peak in 1973. The first Canadian party climbed the mountain on August 14, 1978. In that party were Ray Chipeniuk, Ron Parker, and Erik Sheer.

In August 2003, two climbers from Mississauga, Ontario perished during their descent from the summit. A search was initiated in late August when they failed to meet a plane at a pre-arranged location. The approaching winter weather forced an early end to the search in 2003. In August 2004, their bodies were discovered high up on the mountain. The most plausible scenario appears to be that one of the climbers became injured and was unable to continue the descent. The other climber made an attempt to seek help, taking an alternate route down and apparently fell about 150 feet down a steep headwall.

<text>A data dictionary, or metadata repository, as defined in the &quot;IBM Dictionary of Computing&quot;, is a &quot;centralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format&quot;. &quot;Oracle&quot; defines it as a collection of tables with metadata. The term can have one of several closely related meanings pertaining to databases and database management systems (DBMS):

* A document describing a database or collection of databases
* An integral component of a DBMS that is required to determine its structure
* A piece of middleware that extends or supplants the native data dictionary of a DBMS

==Documentation==
The terms &quot;data dictionary&quot; and &quot;data repository&quot; indicate a more general software utility than a catalogue. A &quot;catalogue&quot; is closely coupled with the DBMS software. It provides the information stored in it to the user and the DBA, but it is mainly accessed by the various software modules of the DBMS itself, such as DDL and DML compilers, the query optimiser, the transaction processor, report generators, and the constraint enforcer. On the other hand, a &quot;data dictionary&quot; is a data structure that stores metadata, i.e., (structured) data about information. The software package for a stand-alone data dictionary or data repository may interact with the software modules of the DBMS, but it is mainly used by the designers, users and administrators of a computer system for information resource management. These systems maintain information on system hardware and software configuration, documentation, application and users as well as other information relevant to system administration.

If a data dictionary system is used only by the designers, users, and administrators and not by the DBMS Software, it is called a &quot;passive data dictionary.&quot; Otherwise, it is called an &quot;active data dictionary&quot; or &quot;data dictionary.&quot; When a passive data dictionary is updated, it is done so manually and independently from any changes to a DBMS (database) structure. With an active data dictionary, the dictionary is updated first and changes occur in the DBMS automatically as a result.

Database users and application developers can benefit from an authoritative data dictionary document that catalogs the organization, contents, and conventions of one or more databases. This typically includes the names and descriptions of various tables (records or entities) and their contents (fields) plus additional details, like the type and length of each data element. Another important piece of information that a data dictionary can provide is the relationship between tables. This is sometimes referred to in entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), or if using set descriptors, identifying which sets database tables participate in.

In an active data dictionary constraints may be placed upon the underlying data. For instance, a range may be imposed on the value of numeric data in a data element (field), or a record in a table may be forced to participate in a set relationship with another record-type. Additionally, a distributed DBMS may have certain location specifics described within its active data dictionary (e.g. where tables are physically located).

The data dictionary consists of record types (tables) created in the database by systems generated command files, tailored for each supported back-end DBMS. Oracle has a list of specific views for the &quot;sys&quot; user. This allows users to look up the exact information that is needed. Command files contain SQL Statements for codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 (for referential integrity), etc., using the specific statement required by that type of database.

There is no universal standard as to the level of detail in such a document.

==Middleware==
In the construction of database applications, it can be useful to introduce an additional layer of data dictionary software, i.e. middleware, which communicates with the underlying DBMS data dictionary. Such a &quot;high-level&quot; data dictionary may offer additional features and a degree of flexibility that goes beyond the limitations of the native &quot;low-level&quot; data dictionary, whose primary purpose is to support the basic functions of the DBMS, not the requirements of a typical application. For example, a high-level data dictionary can provide alternative entity-relationship models tailored to suit different applications that share a common database. Extensions to the data dictionary also can assist in query optimization against distributed databases. Additionally, DBA functions are often automated using restructuring tools that are tightly coupled to an active data dictionary.

Software frameworks aimed at rapid application development sometimes include high-level data dictionary facilities, which can substantially reduce the amount of programming required to build menus, forms, reports, and other components of a database application, including the database itself. For example, PHPLens includes a PHP class library to automate the creation of tables, indexes, and foreign key constraints portably for multiple databases. Another PHP-based data dictionary, part of the RADICORE toolkit, automatically generates program objects, scripts, and SQL code for menus and forms with data validation and complex joins. For the ASP.NET environment, Base One&#x27;s data dictionary provides cross-DBMS facilities for automated database creation, data validation, performance enhancement (caching and index utilization), application security, and extended data types. Visual DataFlex features provides the ability to use DataDictionaries as class files to form middle layer between the user interface and the underlying database. The intent is to create standardized rules to maintain data integrity and enforce business rules throughout one or more related applications.

Some industries use generalized data dictionaries as technical standards to ensure interoperability between systems. The real estate industry, for example, abides by a RESO&#x27;s Data Dictionary to which the National Association of REALTORS mandates its MLSs comply with through its policy handbook. This intermediate mapping layer for MLSs&#x27; native databases is supported by software companies which provide API services to MLS organizations.

==Platform-specific examples==
Developers use a data description specification (DDS) to describe data attributes in file descriptions that are external to the application program that processes the data, in the context of an IBM i. The &quot;sys.ts$&quot; table in Oracle stores information about every table in the database. It is part of the data dictionary that is created when the Oracle Database is created. Developers may also use DDS context from free and open-source software (FOSS) for structured and transactional queries in open environments.

==Typical attributes==

Here is a non-exhaustive list of typical items found in a data dictionary for columns or fields:

* Entity or form name or their ID (EntityID or FormID). The group this field belongs to.
* Field name, such as RDBMS field name
* Displayed field title. May default to field name if blank.
* Field type (string, integer, date, etc.)
* Measures such as min and max values, display width, or number of decimal places. Different field types may interpret this differently. An alternative is to have different attributes depending on field type.
* Field display order or tab order
* Coordinates on screen (if a positional or grid-based UI)
* Default value
* Prompt type, such as drop-down list, combo-box, check-boxes, range, etc.
* Is-required (Boolean) - If &#x27;true&#x27;, the value can not be blank, null, or only white-spaces
* Is-read-only (Boolean)
* Reference table name, if a foreign key. Can be used for validation or selection lists.
* Various event handlers or references to. Example: &quot;on-click&quot;, &quot;on-validate&quot;, etc. See event-driven programming.
* Format code, such as a regular expression or COBOL-style &quot;PIC&quot; statements
* Description or synopsis
* Database index characteristics or specification

<text>A Different Drum was an independent record label and an online store based in Smithfield, Utah, founded in 1996. The label specialized in synthpop and related genres. A Different Drum has released hundreds of albums, singles, and compilations and was the biggest synthpop label in the U.S.

The label is credited with helping to keep the synthpop genre progressing during the grunge rock mid-1990s and into the early 2000s, particularly supporting American Synthpop Groups (Cosmicity, The Echoing Green, B! Machine and others) in their early years. The label also supported older synthpop bands which previously had Billboard chart hits during the 1980s, such as Alphaville (band), and Real Life (band), putting out releases for both bands during this time.

In the early to mid 2000s, A Different Drum signed new acts such as Iris and Provision.

The label held a yearly Synthpop Music Festival which ran for 3 years, from 2004 to 2006; in Salt Lake City, Utah at the Red Lion Hotel. The festival featured label acts that were signed to A Different Drum, performing alongside new unsigned Synthpop bands in a musical showcase spanning three days over Labor Day weekend. The festivals were called ADD2K4, ADD2K5, and ADD2K6; respectively. The first year of the festival was recorded live and released as a 2 C.D. Limited Edition titled &quot;SLC 2K4 Official Bootleg&quot;.

A selection of songs from the label&#x27;s artists have been featured on various versions of Konami&#x27;s Dance Dance Revolution series, including the arcade version of Dance Dance Revolution X.

The label formally ceased operations in 2014.

A Different Drum published more than 350 albums, singles, and various artist compilations.

<text>Edgecumbe () is a town in the Bay of Plenty Region of the North Island of New Zealand, to the west of Whakatāne and south of the Bay&#x27;s coast.

It is the main service town for the agricultural region surrounding the plains of the Rangitaiki River, which flows through the town.

State Highway 2 and the Tāneatua Branch railway line (disused) pass through the town.

The Edgecumbe Dairy Factory, established in 1915, employs 358 people, roughly a fifth of Edgecumbe&#x27;s total population.

==History==
The town is named after the small village of Edgecumbe in Cornwall, United Kingdom, between Penryn and Helston. Edgecumbe was linked with Tauranga and Auckland by rail, with the opening of the East Coast Main Trunk Railway and Taneatua Express in 1928.

In 1987, a large earthquake centred on Edgecumbe shook the Bay of Plenty, causing widespread damage and causing much of the population to leave Edgecumbe.

In July 2004, May 2005 and April 2017, the town experienced heavy flooding that ruined many homes. In the 2005 flood, the river swelled to within 5 cm of breaching the flood banks that had been put in place seven years prior.

===1987 Edgecumbe earthquake===
The earthquake was a major turning point in the history of Edgecumbe. It measured 6.3 on the Richter magnitude scale and struck the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand on 2 March 1987, just after 1.42 pm. The earthquake was very shallow, being centred approximately 8 km from the Earth&#x27;s surface. The earthquake was one of the most damaging New Zealand&#x27;s North Island has experienced in recent decades, with approximately 50% of the houses in Edgecumbe being damaged by the quake. There was extensive damage to a local milk factory, with large storage tanks toppled. Kawerau was another nearby town that suffered damage and Whakatāne was also badly shaken. An 80-tonne New Zealand Railways DC class locomotive was thrown onto its side.

The earthquake caused no fatalities.

However, one person died at the time as a result of a heart attack, possibly due to the quake. A foreshock just minutes before had cut the power supply and many people had moved away from heavy machinery and out of their houses. The largest aftershock was measured at 5.2 and struck at 1.52 pm.

A crack long opened in the Rangitaiki Plains near Edgecumbe, as a result of the earthquake. It is now known as the &#x27;Edgecumbe Fault&#x27;. At one point, the land close to the fault dropped .

The epicentre of the quake was approximately south-south-east of the town of Matatā, or north-north-west of Edgecumbe. The intense ground-shaking caused by the earthquake led to a large number of ground surface failures, including sand boils, ridge-top shatters and debris avalanches on steeper slopes. Because of the earthquake, many people left and therefore Edgecumbe&#x27;s population dropped considerably. Edgecumbe is slowly recovering as it has increased by 21 in the years 2006 to 2013, possibly due to many kiwifruit orchards being affected by PSA.

===2017 Edgecumbe flood===

In April 2017, remnants of Cyclone Debbie caused heavy rainfall in the region. At 8:30 am on April 6, water from the Rangitaiki River breached a stopbank next to Edgecumbe, causing widespread flooding across the township. A state of emergency was declared for the Whakatāne District, and around 2000 people were evacuated to Kawerau and Whakatāne. More than 300 homes were damaged, with some becoming uninhabitable. 

There were no deaths due to the flood, yet, over 50 percent of people there were highly affected by it.

The largest animal rescue in New Zealand history was recorded during the aftermath of the flood. Approximately 1000 animals were rescued by an SPCA led operation, with support from local civil defence rescue teams and veterinarians from Massey University. The event highlighted a significant gap in animal welfare emergency management capability in New Zealand.

<doc id="645151" wikidata="Q57322" url="?curid=645151" title="Volker Beck (politician)">
<text>Volker Beck (born 12 December 1960) is a German politician. From 1994 to 2017, he was a member of the Bundestag, the German federal parliament, for the Green Party. Beck served as the Green Party Speaker for Legal Affairs from 1994 to 2002, and as the Green Party Chief Whip in the Bundestag till 2013. He was also spokesperson for the Green Parliamentary Group for interior affairs and religion.

==Political career==
Beck served as spokesman of the Association of Lesbians and Gays in Germany (Lesben- und Schwulenverband in Deutschland) LSVD for over ten years. He is a supporter of same-sex marriage and has been referred to as the &quot;Father of the German Registered Partnership Act&quot;.

Beck served as spokesperson of the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary group on legal affairs from 1994 to 2002, and as the Green Party Chief Whip in the Bundestag until 2013. He was also spokesperson for the Green Parliamentary Group for interior affairs and religion.

In a German Green leadership crisis he created the expression candystorm in support of Claudia Roth.

On his last day in session the Bundestag decided to vote on the gay marriage bill which Beck struggled for since 1989. On the last day of his parliamentary career, he received a standing ovation following the approval of same-sex marriage bill in the German Bundestag. Beck was credited as one of the most influential and important legislators campaigning for this in the German federal Parliament.

==Political positions==
===Human and gay rights activism===
On 27 May 2006, Beck was attacked and injured during a gay rights demonstration in Moscow, called Moscow Pride. His attack as well as his participation at the Moscow Pride Festival is featured in the documentary &quot;Moscow Pride &#x27;06&quot;.

In May 2007, he was arrested and put in a bus in front of Moscow City Hall by the police. He had wanted to hand over a petition signed by several Members of Parliament at Moscow City Hall. He was attacked and had eggs thrown at his head. As in 2007, his partner Jacques Teyssier tried to protect Beck from attacks by anti gay rights protesters.

Alongside fellow MP Marieluise Beck, Volker Beck has been a vocal critic of Russia&#x27;s human rights situation. During his time as his parliamentary group&#x27;s spokesperson on human rights, he described the repeated prison sentences against Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev as &quot;disproportionate.&quot; He has often urged the German government and the European Union to make unequivocally clear to the Russian government that &quot;the only Russia that can be a strategic partner is one that observes the rule of law.&quot; He also called on Western investors to &quot;put an end to their opportunistic silence.&quot;

Beck spoke in favor of continuing European Union sanctions on Uzbekistan, originally instated after the Uzbek government did not allow an international investigation of the Andijan massacre, on 17 October 2006.

In June 2016, Beck was among 19 people detained by Turkish police central in Istanbul; the police had tried to disperse dozens of activists attempting to gather to mark the annual Istanbul Pride week after authorities banned their march.

===Compensation for victims of Nazism===
Beck is also considered an important figure in securing compensation for victims of Nazism. Alongside Otto Graf Lambsdorff, he negotiated the $4.6 billion fund to compensate people enslaved by the Nazis and later served as one of the trustees of the Foundation &quot;Remembrance, Responsibility and Future&quot;. In 2008, he claimed that the German Parliament should raise more money to fight against right wing extremists.
In 2015, he was awarded the Leo-Baeck-Award by the Central Council of Jews in Germany.

In 2013, Beck complained to R&amp;S, the maker of condoms that were used in a far-right party&#x27;s campaign against immigrant births. The company apologized and pledged to donate 10,000 condoms as well as the proceeds from the NPD order to a German foundation against right-wing extremism and anti-Semitism.

===Foreign affairs===
In 2015, following the agreement on a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, Beck criticized Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel for calling the country a &quot;friend&quot; and argued that &quot;with its position on Israel and its human rights situation this Iranian regime cannot be Germany&#x27;s friend or strategic partner.&quot;

In October 2023, he wanted to stop the financial support for the Palestinian authorities, as well for the water supply, hospitalized and traumatized Palestinian children in hospitals.

=== Sex with minors ===
In 2013, Beck received major media attention, when his 1988 essay: &quot;Amending criminal law? An appeal for a realistic, new orientation of sexuality politics&quot; which promoted the decriminalization of pedosexuality, was released in full by &quot;Spiegel Online&quot;, showing that editorial changes had not altered the message of the essay as he had claimed. In response to the essay&#x27;s initial discovery amidst revelations within the Green Party regarding members&#x27; prior involvement in the pedophilia movement, Beck distanced himself from his previous writing and mentioned that reports from German child care facilities combating child sexual abuse dramatically changed his position.

== Subsequent career ==
Since November 2017 Beck is lecturer at the Center for Studies in Religious Sciences (CERES) at the Ruhr University Bochum.

==Personal life==
Beck is openly gay. He lived in a long-term partnership with Jacques Teyssier until his death from cancer in Berlin on 25 July 2009. The couple had officially registered their partnership in 2008, after 16 years. Beck later entered into a relationship with architect Adrian Petkov, and after registering their partnership in the summer of 2017, the two married on the first day of legal same-sex marriage in Kreuzberg.

===Possession of crystal meth===
In March 2016, a police search based on reasonable suspicion that Beck had purchased and was in possession of a small amount (lowest classification under German narcotics law) of a controlled substance, lead to the seizure of 0.6 grams of an alleged drug. Reportedly, the substance found was crystal meth. Legal proceedings ended with a fine of €7,000 under the classification of &quot;minimal guilt&quot; in April 2016. In the aftermath the Green Party decided for him to remain their spokesperson for religious affairs and elected him to become spokesperson for immigration policy. Irene Mihalic replaced him as spokesperson for domestic policy.

<text>AirPort Extreme is a line of residential gateways made by Apple Inc. that combine the functions of a router, network switch, wireless access point and NAS as well as varied other functions. It is one of Apple&#x27;s former AirPort products. The latest model, the 6th generation, supports 802.11ac networking in addition to older standards. Versions of the same system with a built-in network-accessible hard drive are known as the AirPort Time Capsule.

Apple discontinued developing its lineup of wireless routers in 2016, but continues limited hardware and software support.

==History==
The first AirPort Extreme was announced at the MacWorld expo in San Francisco on January 7, 2003. It featured 802.11g wireless technology for the first time in an AirPort base station.

The name &quot;AirPort Extreme&quot; originally referred to any one of Apple&#x27;s AirPort products that implemented the (then) newly introduced 802.11g Wi-Fi standard, differentiating it from earlier devices that ran the slower 802.11a and b standards. At that time (circa 2003) the gateway part of this lineup was known as the AirPort Extreme Base Station. With the addition of the even faster Draft-N standards in early 2009 the naming of &quot;Base Station&quot; was dropped, and was renamed to AirPort Extreme. Several minor upgrades followed with the wireless-N models, mostly to change antenna and wireless output power. In 2013, a major upgrade changed the physical structure of the device, added 802.11ac support, and added more antennas.

The AirPort Extreme has gone through three distinct physical forms. The earliest models had a similar plastic housing to the original AirPort Base Station, in a round &quot;flying saucer&quot; shape. From 2007 to 2013, the devices took on a flat rounded rectangle shape, similar in layout and size to the Mac mini or early models of the Apple TV. The 2013 model had a more vertical form, taller than it was wide.

===Discontinuation===
In approximately 2016, Apple disbanded the wireless router team that developed the AirPort Time Capsule and AirPort Extreme router. In 2018, Apple formally discontinued both products, exiting the router market. Bloomberg News noted that &quot;Apple rarely discontinues product categories&quot; and that its decision to leave the business was &quot;a boon for other wireless router makers.&quot;

==Features==

===Overview===
* Fully featured 802.11ac Wi-Fi base station
* Sleep Proxy Service
* 4 Ethernet ports (3 LAN ports, 1 WAN port) — all ports are gigabit Ethernet on newer versions
* USB 2.0 interface for disk and printer sharing
* Built-in file server (AFP and SMB)
* Runs VxWorks Operating System by WindRiver or a customized version of NetBSD.

===AirPort Disk===
The AirPort Disk feature allows users to plug a USB hard drive into the AirPort Extreme for use as a network-attached storage (NAS) device for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows clients. Users may also connect a USB hub and printer. The performance of USB hard drives attached to an AirPort Extreme is slower than if the drive were connected directly to a computer. This is due to the processor speed on the AirPort Extreme. Depending on the setup and types of reads and writes, performance ranges from 0.5 to 17.5 MB/s for writing and 1.9 to 25.6 MB/s for reading. Performance for the same disk connected directly to a computer would be 6.6 to 31.6 MB/s for writing and 7.1 to 37.2 MB/s for reading. NTFS-formatted drives are not supported.

==Models by generation==

===Original generation (2003) ===

The original AirPort Extreme Base Station in 2003 was so named because of its support for the 802.11g standard of the day, as well as for its ability to serve up to 50 Macs or PCs simultaneously. One feature found in most models of this generation was an internal 56K dial-up modem, allowing homes that lacked a broadband connection to enjoy wireless connectivity, albeit at dial-up speeds. It was the only generation to use the &quot;flying saucer&quot; form factor. Later generations would adopt the short, rounded-square form factor that would be seen until 2013.

===1st generation===
On January 9, 2007 the AirPort Extreme began shipping, with support for 802.11n draft specification, and built-in wireless print and storage server.

===2nd generation===
On March 19, 2008, Apple released a firmware update for both models of the AirPort Extreme that, according to third-party reports, allowed AirPort Disks to be used in conjunction with Time Machine, similar to the functionality provided by AirPort Time Capsule.

===3rd generation===
On March 3, 2009, Apple unveiled a new AirPort Extreme with simultaneous dual-band 802.11 Draft-N radios. This allowed full 802.11 Draft-N 2x2 communication in both 802.11 Draft-N bands at the same time.

===4th generation===
On October 20, 2009, Apple unveiled an updated AirPort Extreme with antenna improvements.

===5th generation===
On June 21, 2011, Apple unveiled an updated AirPort Extreme, referred to as &quot;AirPort Extreme 802.11n (5th Generation)&quot;.

The detailed table of output power comparison between the &quot;4th generation&quot; model MC340LL/A and the &quot;5th generation&quot; model MD031LL/A can be seen below:
Note: A 3dB increase is equivalent to a doubling of power output.

===6th generation===
On June 10, 2013, Apple unveiled an updated AirPort Extreme, referred to as &quot;AirPort Extreme 802.11ac (6th Generation)&quot;. The 6th generation AirPort Extreme (and 5th generation AirPort Time Capsule) featured three-stream 802.11ac Wi-Fi technology with a maximum data rate of 1.3 Gbit/s, which is nearly three times faster than 802.11n. Time Machine was now supported using an external USB hard drive connected to AirPort Extreme (802.11ac model only).

==Comparison chart==
*802.11n draft-specification support in 1st- to 3rd-generation models.
**802.11ac draft-specification support in 6th-generation model.
***All models support IPv6 tunnel mode.
****Supported by Apple.

==Discontinuation and support==
According to a Bloomberg report on November 21, 2016, &quot;Apple Inc. has disbanded its division that develops wireless routers, another move to try to sharpen the company’s focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue, according to people familiar with the matter.&quot;

In an April 2018 statement to 9to5Mac, Apple announced the discontinuation of its AirPort line, effectively leaving the consumer router market. Apple continued supporting the AirPort Extreme.

<doc id="645159" wikidata="Q12718756" url="?curid=645159" title="Sukhmani Sahib">
<text>Sukhmani Sahib (), known under the title of Gauri Sukhmani in the scripture (named after the Gauri raga musical measure it belongs to), is usually translated to mean &quot;Prayer of Peace&quot; is a set of 192 &quot;padas&quot; (stanzas of 10 hymns) present in the holy &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;, the main scripture and living Guru of Sikhism from &quot;Ang&quot; 262 to &quot;Ang&quot; 296 (about 35 count). This Gurbani text (writing of the Gurus) was written by the 5th Guru, Guru Arjan (1563–1606) at Amritsar in around 1602. Guru Arjan first recited the bani at Gurdwara Barth Sahib in the Gurdaspur district of Punjab, India.

==Content==
The composition deals with such topics such as &quot;Simran&quot; (general meditation that leads to merging with God) and &quot;Nam Japna&quot; (meditation of &quot;Naam&quot;), the greatness of Saints and &quot;Sadh Sangat&quot; (holy congregation), true devotion, doing good deeds, the nature of the mind, the badness of slandering, concepts relating to &quot;Brahmvidya&quot;, &quot;Advaita&quot;, &quot;Sargun and Nirgun&quot;, materialism and death, &quot;Hukam&quot;, and other similar topics.

===Recitation===
Sukhmani Sahib is frequently recited by Sikhs is one of the popular &quot;Banis&quot; (compositions of the Guru). It can be done individually or as a group usually in either a place of worship (&quot;Gurdwara&quot;) or at home. Reciting the entire Sukhmani Sahib takes about 60 to 90 minutes, and is sometimes undertaken by everyone in a smaller congregation with turn by turn reading. Reciting the &quot;Gurbani&quot; of Sukhmani Sahib is believed to bring peace to one&#x27;s mind and aid help remembering God constantly.

===Form===
Sukhmani Sahib belongs to the &quot;Raag Gauri&quot; with &quot;Gauri&quot; meaning pure. The term &quot;Sukhmani&quot; comprises two words: &quot;Sukh&quot; (peace) and &quot;Mani&quot; (the treasure or jewel of the mind). It typically is found in &quot;Gutka&quot; form (small prayer book).

====Structure====
Sukhmani Sahib is divided into 24 &quot;Ashtpadi&quot; (Section). The &quot;Ashtpada&quot; is the Sanskrit word for a verse that has eight (&quot;Asht&quot;) metrical feet (&quot;pādi&quot;). Before the Ashtpadi begins there is a Salok of two lines and then each &quot;Ashtpadi&quot; contains eight &quot;padas&quot; of 10 hymns per &quot;pada&quot;.

==History==

Sukhmani Sahib was composed by Guru Arjan around 1602 before he compiled the Adi Granth. The Guru compiled it at Ramsar &quot;Sarovar&quot; (Sacred pool), Amritsar which at the time was in thick woods.

It is believed Sri Chand came to Amritsar to meet Guru Arjan and he engaged in the creation of Sukhmani. The Guru had written 16 canto and requested Sri Chand to finish the composition. Sri Chand out of humility only recited the Salok from the Mul Mantar by Guru Nanak, his father. Therefore this Salok was put by the Guru in the start of the 17 canto.

Prominent Sikh saint Baba Nand Singh would tell Sikhs to recite Sukhmani Sahib twice daily.

<doc id="645161" wikidata="Q7717547" url="?curid=645161" title="The Big Breakfast">
<text>The Big Breakfast is a British breakfast light entertainment television programme that was broadcast on Channel 4 from 1992 to 2002, and as a revival from 2021 to 2022. The show had various presenters, starting with Chris Evans and Gaby Roslin at launch with the revival episodes presented by Mo Gilligan and AJ Odudu.

The programme was distinctive for broadcasting live from a real house (which had been lock-keepers&#x27; cottages), commonly referred to as &quot;The Big Breakfast House&quot;, or more simply, &quot;The House&quot;, located on Fish Island, in Bow in east London. The original house on Fish Island in Bow has since been sold.

The show was a mix of news, weather, interviews, audience phone-ins and general features, with a light tone which was in competition with the maturer GMTV and BBC Breakfast programmes.

==History==
&quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; was launched on 28 September 1992 to replace &quot;The Channel Four Daily&quot;, which was Channel 4&#x27;s unsuccessful first foray into the breakfast television market. The &quot;Daily&quot;, which had focused on current affairs and news bulletins alongside bitesized magazine shows, a quiz show segment and a daily cartoon slot, had failed to attract enough viewers so Channel 4 opted to change direction and work towards a lighter style concentrating mainly on entertainment and humour with news bulletins restricted to brief summaries every 20 minutes.

The first two presenters were Chris Evans (from 1992 to 1994) and Gaby Roslin (1992 to 1996). At its height in 1993, viewing figures reached around two million per edition, and it was the highest rated UK breakfast television programme. Along with Evans and Roslin, Bob Geldof presented a short-lived political interview slot. His wife Paula Yates interviewed people whilst lying on a bed, and the puppet characters Zig and Zag created morning mayhem in the bathroom with Evans in a slot called &#x27;The Crunch&#x27;.

As part of his contract with &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, Evans was committed to developing a new show for Channel 4. &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Your Toothbrush&quot; began in early 1994, and Evans cut his involvement with &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; to three days a week, Tuesday to Thursday. &quot;Neighbours&quot; actor Mark Little replaced Evans on Mondays and Fridays. When Evans left the show later that year, Little continued Thursdays, and Fridays while Paul Ross took over Mondays to Wednesdays. Richard Orford replaced Ross around Easter 1995 but was quickly dropped and exchanged with &quot;Down Your Doorstep&quot; presenter Keith Chegwin. In July 1995, the show reverted to using just one male presenter (Mark Little) throughout the week. Chegwin would cover for Little when he was on tour as a comedian or on holiday.

Roslin continued full-time until she made way for Zoe Ball in 1996. Audience figures dropped a little after Evans left, and a little further after Roslin departed. Mark Little left the programme in July 1996, following press reports that he and Ball had fallen out. Little was replaced by Keith Chegwin, who himself exited the programme in August 1996, just ahead of a relaunch. To stem the sliding viewing figures, the Big Breakfast house was refurbished at a cost of £2 million. New presenters Rick Adams and Sharron Davies were brought in but viewing figures fell dramatically. Davies left the programme in early 1997, to be replaced by Denise van Outen. Van Outen had initially been brought in as part of the September 1996 relaunch as a weather presenter, before being given a role based at the house as the phone room presenter and holiday relief for Davies. In June 1997, Johnny Vaughan covered for Adams for a fortnight alongside Van Outen, the pair forging a successful on-screen partnership. Adams left the programme shortly afterwards and, in September 1997, the Vaughan and Van Outen partnership was made permanent. Audience figures stabilised and the duo fronted the programme together until Van Outen&#x27;s departure on 1 January 1999 (a New Year&#x27;s Day pre-record). Kelly Brook was installed as Vaughan&#x27;s new co-presenter despite an internet campaign for the role to be awarded to Liza Tarbuck, who had successfully covered for Van Outen in the summer of 1998. However, Brook struggled in the role and left the programme in early summer 1999. Liza Tarbuck, having again covered the co-presenter role alongside Vaughan prior to Brook&#x27;s departure, was made permanent at the end of August 1999. She left the following summer and, following Vaughan&#x27;s annual one-month summer break, Denise van Outen returned to co-host in September 2000 for Vaughan&#x27;s final four months on the programme. Vaughan and Van Outen&#x27;s final &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; was on 12 January 2001.

==Demise==
The programme relaunched with a new logo and updated theme on 22 January 2001. The house had also been redecorated in more muted colours, echoing the ill-fated 1996 revamp. The programme moved to a lineup of three main presenters: Paul Tonkinson, Amanda Byram and Donna Air. However, Tonkinson was dropped from the programme at the end of March 2001 and Air left not long after. The programme reverted to two main presenters once more, with Byram and Richard Bacon. The living room, which had been repainted a dark red as part of the revamp, was changed to a bright yellow and pink design, while the main presenter chairs were also reinstalled in front of the living room&#x27;s French windows. They replaced the bright-green sofa which had also been brought in as part of the revamp. The new logo was replaced with one more closely resembling the traditional &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; logo, albeit utilising a slightly different font. Mike McClean was given a role on the programme, as Down Your Doorstep presenter and cover for Bacon, most regularly on Fridays when Bacon would reprise his former Down Your Doorstep role alongside Johnny Vegas. During this time, a pilot episode was filmed on a Saturday with Chris Moyles and Dominic Byrne (reading the news), with Andy Goldstein doing links from Los Angeles. This pilot episode was shown to bosses at Channel 4, after which Moyles was offered the role but declined.
==Cancellation==
In December 2001, it was announced that &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; was to be axed the following March. In the programme&#x27;s final months, former cover presenter Lisa Rogers was given a role as an extra presenter while Zig and Zag returned for the final six weeks in their former slot, The Crunch, for which a new bathroom set was installed in the house. The final &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; aired on 29 March 2002 and included a retrospective that included contributions from Evans, Roslin, Vaughan and Van Outen. Both Evans and Vaughan declared the cancelling of the show a bad idea, but the show ended with a tribute from the Prince of Wales before the last ever Friday song. When the show finished, the house reverted to a private residence, now known as The Cottage. After renovation following a fire, it has also been used for a few television shows, including the one-off special edition of &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, which aired in 2021.

In total, 2,481 episodes were broadcast during the original run. Episodes were broadcast every weekday morning from 28 September 1992 to 29 March 2002, with exception of 12–14 September 2001, when it was replaced with news coverage of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States of America, for a total of 2,477. In addition to this, four extra episodes were broadcast on Christmas Day 1994 and Christmas Eve 1995 (both of which fell on the weekend), and the evenings of New Year&#x27;s Eve 1992 and 1999.

==Innovations==

Mark Lamarr, Keith Chegwin, Paul Ross, Richard Orford, Richard Bacon and Mike McClean were &quot;down your doorstep&quot; outside broadcasters, often turning up live and unannounced at an unsuspecting viewer&#x27;s house, while rooms within the lock keepers&#x27; houses featured the puppets Zig and Zag and video games guru Ben the Boffin.

The show&#x27;s style, with hand-held cameras moving around all of the set, meant that many of the crew members could be seen on screen. This led to them getting nicknames, such as &#x27;Sturdy Girl&#x27;, who was regularly asked to shake her head so that her hair would be hurled around whilst music played and the camera zoomed in and out.

==Spin-offs and related programming==
===&quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; and &quot;The Bigger Breakfast&quot;===
Between 1997 and 2000, during most nationally recognised UK school holiday periods, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; would run beyond its typical 9am finish to provide continuity into and out of unrelated shows aimed primarily towards children. This would last throughout the morning, usually until around midday. Although typically presented to the viewer as simply a programme on Channel 4, most of &quot;The Bigger Breakfast&quot; is perhaps better classified as an informal style of in-vision continuity.

The strand also acted as an umbrella brand for the programming which it linked to, by use of &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; style break-bumpers and Digital On-Screen Graphics. The expanded format always featured the regular content of The Big Breakfast from 7am to 9am. The first run of &quot;The Bigger Breakfast&quot; during the summer of 1997 was titled as such all the way from its 7am start, presented throughout by Richard Orford and Denise van Outen. Future editions would see slight separations made from the 7am to 9am content, by way of this portion of the show being branded and scheduled as&quot; The Big Breakfast&quot;, with all content after 9am taking on the expanded Bigger Breakfast name. After a while, a further distinction was made by using a different set of presenters from that of &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;. Presenters of &quot;The Bigger Breakfast&quot; included Josie D&#x27;Arby, Ben Shephard, Melanie Sykes and Dermot O&#x27;Leary.

Programming was primarily composed of reruns of Channel 4 shows and US imports. The line-up changed frequently. The list below is of some of series featured on &quot;The Big Breakfast and the Bigger Breakfast&quot; over the years:

&quot;The Bigger Breakfast&quot; was discontinued after Christmas holidays in 2000. The block of programming provided within &quot;The Bigger Breakfast&quot; was retained, with Channel 4&#x27;s youth strand T4 taking over the continuity role.

===&quot;Snap&quot;===
Snap Cackle Pop, a regular and recurring feature throughout the history of &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, was briefly retitled as simply Snap, in 1997. As well as continuing as a short, daily entertainment news feature within &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Snap&quot; also became a show in its own right. Airing once weekly at 6.00pm on Channel 4, the half hour show was a light hearted round-up of recent news stories concerning popular entertainment in the UK.

Presented by Denise van Outen, the show was intentionally recognisable as being closely related to &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, from which it originated and continued to be part of. &quot;Snap&quot; contained a number of elements synonymous with &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, such as using the very same boudoir set and on-the-bed interviewing of guests. However, care was generally taken not to alienate viewers who were not so familiar with &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;.

===The Big Breakfast End of the Year Show 1992===
Three months after first appearing, Chris Evans, Gaby Roslin and Paula Yates hosted a live edition of the show, seeing in the new year of 1993. Zsa Zsa Gabor featured as a special guest.

===The Biggest Breakfast Ever===
On 1 January 2000, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; aired an extended New Year&#x27;s Day edition entitled &quot;The Biggest Breakfast Ever&quot;, celebrating the arrival of the year 2000. Written by John Mann and Ged Parsons and broadcasting from 12:30 a.m. to just past 9:00 a.m., the special featured various retrospective features and the competition &quot;Owe? No You Don&#x27;t!&quot;—where contestants competed in classic &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; games (concluding with the new game &quot;Wonga&quot;) for a chance to have their debts paid off.

===Talking Bowlocks===
In January 2021, members of &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; production team launched a podcast in which they discussed their experiences working on the series.

==Revival==

===2021 &quot;Black to Front Day&quot; special===
In September 2021, it was announced that the show would return for a one-off event known as &quot;Black to Front Day&quot;, which would feature and celebrate the talents of those with black heritage. The show was presented by Mo Gilligan and AJ Odudu and had many guests from African American and Black heritages in celebration. The show was broadcast once again from the show&#x27;s original home at Lock Keepers&#x27; Cottages.

===2022 relaunch===
On 26 May 2022 it was confirmed that the series would return part time for four Saturdays in a two and a half hour slot from 13 August 2022, with Gilligan and Odudu again returning to host from a new house, revealed to be in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire. Denise van Outen returned as a guest to &quot;hand over the reins&quot; of the show to the two new presenters. In June 2023, a Channel 4 spokesman announced that there were no plans to commission any further episodes, but did not rule out the possibility of it returning at some point in the future.

==Features==
===Question About the Clip===
Before most advertisement breaks a clip from an upcoming TV show or movie would be shown, a question being asked by one of the hosts about it; the answer would be revealed after the advert break, along with details of the show or film. This feature would result in the production team chorusing &quot;Don&#x27;t phone, it&#x27;s just for fun!&quot; which was a Chris Evans creation, initially used on his radio shows before he shot to fame on &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;.

===Question of the Day===
A phone-in feature encouraging viewers to provide humorous answers throughout the morning to a pertinent (or occasionally inane) question. At one point it was accompanied by a fanfare, apparently played on the trumpet by &quot;little Ted&quot; beneath the camera (in fact a member of the team waving a toy trumpet in shot). One morning&#x27;s question was &quot;What should the BBC do to improve &quot;EastEnders&quot;?&quot;, and one viewer suggested adding Barbara Windsor to the cast; this actually occurred shortly afterwards.

===Super Hints===
&quot;Your indispensable guide to a &quot;better&quot; life!&quot;, this feature appeared during the early years of the show; in it celebrities would give various simple but useful hints for such issues as cleaning or keeping food fresh.

===Streaky Bacon===
&quot;Streaky Bacon&quot; became a regular feature, in which Richard Bacon would get a member of the public out of their house to &#x27;streak&#x27; along their street wearing nothing but bacon-covered underwear in order to win their weight in bacon from their local butcher.

===Vital Statistics===
&quot;Vital Statistics&quot; was another common feature, particularly in the Johnny Vaughan era. These would often relate to a news story, a guest or a topic they had discussed, such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; on their Doctor Who Special.

===On the Bed===
A key feature for the first five years was the &quot;On the Bed&quot; interview. Paula Yates (the then wife of Bob Geldof, whose company produced the show), and later Paul O&#x27;Grady (as Lily Savage) and Vanessa Feltz assumed the role of interviewer. One of the most infamous on-air moments was Paula Yates&#x27; open flirting during an interview with Michael Hutchence as a prelude to their affair.

===More Tea, Vicar===
A repeating feature in the Vaughan and Van Outen era, in which an erratically filmed, sped up video clip of a line of tea cups was shown to a call-in viewer. Vaughan, dressed as an Anglican vicar, and Van Outen, dressed as a nun replete with false teeth and an inferiority complex, then explained the rules. The caller guessed the number of tea cups shown in the video lead in, with Vaughan responding &quot;More tea, vicar&quot; if the number is too low; &quot;Less tea, vicar&quot; if too high. If the contestant guessed the correct number within the time limit, a prize was awarded.

===From Me Shed, Son===
The inventor of the wind-up radio, Trevor Baylis, would join Johnny Vaughan in the shed to discuss innovative new products. Vaughan tended to make fun of Baylis for being older.

===Wonga===
A Jenga-style game, followed by various shouting and anarchy, with fans and the Wonga Lawyer. The show famously went over 27 minutes for a game once, with the &quot;Millennium Big Breakfast&quot; actually being commissioned with extra time for Wonga.

===Wonga money===
&quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; used to give out &quot;wonga money&quot; to people when they won money because they didn&#x27;t want to give it to them on the show. They would give the real thing to them later.

===The Friday Song===
Each Friday the two main presenters and the whole crew would gather in the hallway for The Friday Song. The song would look back at events that happened on the show each week

The lyrics to the chorus went as follows:

&quot;Singing, wakey, wakey, wakey rise and shine,&quot;
&quot;The big breakfast is the only way to dine,&quot;
&quot;It&#x27;s your number one big breakie&quot;
&quot;So get it down your neckie,&quot;
&quot;And stick with us from seven until nine!&quot;

==Lock Keepers&#x27; Cottages==
Unusually for a live British TV show at the time of its creation, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; was broadcast entirely from a real house. Located alongside the River Lea, in east London, the property became informally known as &#x27;The Big Breakfast House&#x27;. Filming would frequently take place within the large grounds of the property and the closely surrounding area. The cottages are in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

Built in 1947, the property originally comprised three cottages which housed the lock keepers, toll takers, and navigation operators of the Old Ford Locks in Bow. By the time of purchase by the programme-makers, Planet 24, in 1992, the property had become Grade II listed and had remained unused for around 20 years. Extensive renovation work saw the transformation of the three cottages into one large three-bedroom property, specifically fitted for use as a TV studio. The exterior character of the property was largely unchanged. During the first four years of the show, the given address for the house was number 2, Lock Keepers&#x27; Cottages, Old Ford Lock, London E3 2NN. The &#x27;2&#x27; was later dropped.

In 1996, due to the declining popularity of &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, the house was transformed in an art deco-style makeover. The original brickwork was virtually entirely covered over with a smooth rendered finish, painted white. Two large balconies now adorned the front and rear. The only untouched exterior features recognisable from the show&#x27;s original styling were the four brick chimneys and the roof. The legality of this extensive makeover could be questioned as having broken the rules of its Grade II listed status. The work carried out is purported to have cost around £2million, largely funded by its sale to the show&#x27;s broadcaster, Channel Four Television.

Structurally, the house largely remained in this style for the remainder of the series. The only notable structural alterations were the removal of the front balcony, the partial removal of the balcony to the rear and minor alterations to the styling of the doors and windows.

However, the character of the house was altered through several artistic makeovers to both the interior and exterior. The exterior was painted bright yellow, later a light brown similar in shade to the original brickwork, followed by a faux red brickwork effect which was painted onto the render. The latter style became the final look of the house, during the original show&#x27;s final three-and-a-half years.

===Cottages since &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;===
In November 2002, seven-and-a-half months after &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; was axed, a fire destroyed a significant proportion of the first floor of the cottages. A large part of the roof was also destroyed in the blaze. The fire was deemed suspicious as there was no gas or electrical supply to the building.

The house was slashed in value because of the fire of November 2002, and was bought for little more than half the original asking price of £1 million at £550,000. Since the fire, extensive work has taken place to restore the house but some of the well-recognised aspects of the house from its use during the run of &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; remain. It is now used as a family home.

The newly renovated house features in the BBC Two show &quot;Neneh and Andi Dish It Up&quot;, BBC Three&#x27;s &quot;Singing With the Enemy&quot;, &quot;Too Fat To Toddle&quot; on ITV1, and the one-off revival of &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; on Channel 4.

The cottages are located about 200 metres from the site of the main stadium used in the 2012 Olympic Games. In 2005, the cottages became part of a compulsory purchase order for the Games, giving rise to speculation that the building may be demolished. However, the cottages and gardens remain unchanged.

The house made a cameo appearance in a Channel 4 ident shown in the lead-up to the channel&#x27;s coverage of the Paralympics in August 2012.

===Life after Lock Keepers&#x27; Cottages===
&quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;&#x27;s return on 13 August 2022 has been confirmed to be from a new house, leaving the original Lock Keepers&#x27; Cottages behind for the first time in the show’s history. The new house is located in Potters Bar. Filming takes place on The Villa mansion, a seven-bedroom cottage set in ten acres of countryside.

<text>Wizadora is a children&#x27;s television programme created by Don Arioli and Carolyne Cullum. It was originally broadcast on SWR in 1991 and it was used as an English-language learning tool for non-English speakers. In 1993, the series was picked up by ITV in the United Kingdom.

==Development==
The series&#x27; pilot starred &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; writer and actress Connie Booth, who had been alerted to the character by John Cleese who had taken an interest in the production. The pilot was never broadcast.

The concept was then developed into a language teaching tool for children to learn English as a second language, published by Oxford University Press in 1991. Books, audio, and media were produced alongside the series. The title role of Wizadora was played by Connie Booth in the unaired pilot, before Maria Gough took on the role for Oxford University Press. Cathy Lawday was the writer and editor of the books and media produced for Oxford.

In 1992, Meridian Broadcasting picked up the series for broadcast on television. Considerable changes were made for this series, including the introduction of Wendy van der Plank as Wizadora, who remained as the character from 1993 to 1996. Lizzie McPhee took over the role in 1997 until the series&#x27; end. Tatty, who was originally played by a woman (Debbie Cumming), was now played by a man (Joe Greco 1993–94, Steven Ryde 1994–98) and Phoebe, who was originally played by actor Emma Amos, was re-introduced as a &quot;life-sized&quot; model. Many characters were introduced and the original characters were given a makeover. Connie Booth was brought back in to write episodes for the series, among others.

== Characters ==
* Wizadora (played by Connie Booth in the unaired pilot episode, Maria Gough in the Oxford series, and Wendy van der Plank (1993-96) and Lizzie McPhee (1997-98) in the ITV series) – The title character and protagonist of the series, a trainee and later apprentice wizard who receives her magic wand in the pilot episode and initially has problems getting her spells right. Some of the things in Wizadora&#x27;s kitchen are able to talk due to stray spells. Wizadora often breaks the fourth wall and talks to the viewers, and usually asks for their help when casting her spells. Wizadora&#x27;s catchphrases include &quot;Oh, botheration!&quot; and &quot;Time for a bit of Wizzification!&quot;. Wendy van der Plank returned to the role after maternity leave on 29 January 1998, after being temporarily replaced by Lizzie McPhee from September 1997.

===Wizadora&#x27;s companions===
* Tatty Bogle (played by Debbie Cumming in the Oxford series and Joe Greco(1993-94) and Steven Ryde (1994–98) in the ITV series) – A dim-witted scarecrow who lives in Wizadora&#x27;s back garden and continually gets his words muddled up. The character was played by a woman before being reintroduced as a man for ITV. Ryde was the voice-over announcer between programmes for ITV&#x27;s CITV strand during the same period.
* Stan the Shopkeeper (played by Brian Murphy) – A shopkeeper who regularly takes delivery of new magical catalogue items and is very cautious of Wizadora&#x27;s spells. 
* Pippa the Postwoman (played by Tessa Hatts) – A postwoman who rides a bike on her rounds and ofter becomes tired. 
* Top/Sticky/Bottom – Three talking drawer people, who resemble socks. Once described as &quot;a real nuisance&quot; by Wizadora, they are very naughty, usually teasing Hangle and/or Filbert, and are always attempting to steal food or getting up to some kind of mischief whenever Wizadora&#x27;s back is turned. Their antics usually end up causing much trouble; one time Top invented a Grub Grabber to try and steal some food, but the device frightened Filbert who accidentally knocked over some potions, some of which got into Very Old Fish&#x27;s tank and turned him into a purple blob. Wizadora usually punishes them by zapping them back into their drawers with her wand.
* Phoebe – A talking telephone. In the Oxford series, actor Emma Amos was dressed in a pink costume to play the role. In the ITV series, Phoebe appears as a &#x27;life-sized&#x27; model telephone, pink with a yellow headset, but in later series, she is orange with a red headset. From Series Six onwards, her headset is red with coloured stars on it. Phoebe answers calls, takes messages, and speaks various languages. Phoebe was voiced by four different voice actors during the ITV series run.
* Filbert (ITV Series One to Five only) – A squeaking vegetable (a Vegimal) and a fellow trainee wizard. He is also regularly seen gardening. He was born from a seed in the first ITV series, and at first, Wizadora had no idea as to who he was. He loves to water plants and is best friends with Tatty. In Series One, Filbert talked in gibberish as he was still learning how to speak, and in later series, English, as the character develops. Filbert often gets himself into trouble, although meaning well. He is very kind-hearted and is always offering to help out Wizadora or Tatty. In the Series Five episode &quot;Filbert&#x27;s New House&quot;, he leaves Wizadora&#x27;s place to start a new life independently.
* Dog Doormat (ITV Series One only) – A barking doormat. 
* Hangle – A purple coat hanger (but who insists on calling himself a cloak hanger) with a yellow rain coat, glasses and a purple moustache, who has quite an obsession with cleaning. In the episode &quot;Hangle&#x27;s Big Day&quot;, he locks everyone out in the garden because he thinks they are too untidy. As a result, he ends up hurting his back due to being too stubborn. He has a crude sense of humour and is also quite bossy. In the first episode of Series One, Hangle introduces himself as &quot;Cliff Hangle, cloak hanger extraordinaire&quot;.
* Very Old Fish – A cryptic, talking male fish who likes to tell stories about his life. 
* Poot (ITV Series Two onwards) – Wizadora&#x27;s computer, who is often used to help with Wizadora&#x27;s questions. In Series Two and Three, Poot was male, green and flat shaped. In Series Four, the character was re-introduced as a female and was given a more computer-like appearance with a pale orange face (Rebecca Nagan&#x27;s). 
* Nigel the Snail (ITV Series Two onwards) – A blue snail who lives with Very Old Fish.
* The Crows (Series Three onwards) – Two crows; brothers called Boris and Horace, who cause mayhem for Tatty Bogle in the garden.
* Roxy (Introduced in Series Five) – A friendly talking spider who lives in Tatty&#x27;s treehouse. 
* Dusty (seen in ITV Series One and again in Series Six) – A creature who lives under the fridge, has a very loud operatic voice, and is usually sleeping.
* Tom and Katie (played by Harriet Carmichael and Adam Johnstone; Oxford series only) – two children who live near Wizadora. Not seen in the ITV series.

=== Other cast and credits ===
Puppeteers Phil Eason, Francis Wright, Michael Bayliss, Sue Dacre, Jeremy Stockwell, Don Austen, Brian Herring, Neil Sterenberg, Rebecca Nagan, Debbie Cumming, and Sheila Clark worked on the series.

The ITV series was made for Meridian Broadcasting by production companies Workhouse and North Pole Productions at The Fountain Studios in New Malden and directed by David Crozier. Fifteen episodes of Series 3 were directed by Wendy J. Dyer. The theme music was composed by Dave Hutton who was also the Senior Cameraman on the first four series of the show. The theme tune for the ITV series was recorded at Gordon Thrussell&#x27;s studios at Ashford in Kent and the credits show music by &#x27;Hutt and Thrust&#x27;. This was because the director, David Crozier, did not want the same name for two different credits on the programme (i.e.: Snr Cameraman and Music). The other cameramen were Roger Backhouse, and Angus Macmillan and sometimes Steve Leach. The vision mixer was Julie Miller.

==Reception==
One episode of &quot;Wizadora&quot; starring Lizzie Mcphee was broadcast on CITV on 5 January 2013 (the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary) as part of a CITV anniversary special. The channel received its highest viewing figures to date: &quot;Wizadora&quot; attracted 460,000 followed by &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, which attracted 578,000 viewers during the &quot;old skool&quot; weekend run. This was the first time the show had been broadcast in the UK since repeats were shown on Living TV in the early 2000s. As of June 2020, episodes from Series One are now showing on BritBox in the UK.

==Revamp==

In 2003, Entertainment Rights produced a 9-minute pilot for a proposed rebooted series for Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Milkshake!&quot; strand with Anne Foy as Wizadora. Although a new version of the original theme tune was used and the overall look of the set generally in keeping with the earlier version, characters were given varying makeovers, with none of the original models being used, and several new minor characters introduced. CGI and Chroma key effects featured heavily. The proposed new series was not picked up, reportedly due to it being considered too costly.

Although there are no plans for the ITV series to return, the Oxford series is still in production with episodes being repeated on SWR Television. The original Oxford series is still used today as a teaching tool for children to learn English as second language. The DVD, book, and audio tapes are still available to buy online, along with a PC-CD ROM. A free app was produced in 2016. A website was set up in 2015, though it is now defunct as of 2018. In 2016, the German SWR Television Educational Programmes set up a website featuring the series to foster use of Wizadora films and educational games in elementary schools in Germany. Free educational games based on the series have been developed since 2016 (apps for Android, iOS, and web-based for desktop computers) and are available on www.wizadora.de.

<doc id="645165" wikidata="Q5134736" url="?curid=645165" title="Cloacal exstrophy">
<text>Cloacal exstrophy (CE) is a severe birth defect wherein much of the abdominal organs (the bladder and intestines) are exposed. It often causes the splitting of the bladder, genitalia, and the anus. It is sometimes called OEIS complex.

Diagnostic tests can include ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), intravenous pyelogram (IVP), nuclear renogram, computerized axial tomography (CT scan), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cloacal exstrophy is a rare birth defect, present in 1/200,000 pregnancies and 1/400,000 live births. It is associated with a defect of the ventral body wall and can be caused by inhibited mesodermal migration. The defect can often be comorbid with spinal bifida and kidney abnormalities. Many individuals who are born with XY cloacal exstrophy are assigned female at birth due to the appearance of the external genitalia. Performing genital surgery on intersex infants for cosmetic purposes is considered a human rights violation by the World Health Organization.

== Cloacal exstrophy males reassigned and raised as females ==
Between 1960 and 2000, doctors believed XY males with cloacal exstrophy would be happier socially as females, and surgically reassigned them. This occurred under the belief that humans were born psychosexually neutral. The practice proved controversial, after follow-ups by William Reiner found that many struggled to adhere to a female gender identity, had masculine interests, were attracted to females, or reverted to the male sex spontaneously or upon learning they were genetic males.

According to J. Michael Bailey:In terms of their sexual orientations, a 2016 academic review by J. Michael Bailey found 7 published cases of genetic males who were reassigned as females at birth and raised as girls, 5 of whom were cloacal exstrophy cases. All were strongly attracted to females. According to a 2015 article in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Wiliam Reiner has followed up on the sexual orientations of approximately 70 genetic males who were raised as females. Only one reported having sexual attractions to males, &quot;I’m more convinced than ever that sexual orientation is built in... certainly for males&quot; he said. A 2023 review by Swift-Gallant et al. cited an additional two cases from media reports, both of whom were gynephilic (attracted to women).

Reiner&#x27;s results have caused some doctors to reconsider the practice of sex reassigning genetic males. A 2011 study found that 79% of paediatric urologists surveyed favoured male assignment for genetic males with cloacal exstrophy.

=== Cases in the media ===

* Joe Holliday, a British cloacal exstrophy male who was reassigned and raised as a female. Holliday had masculine interests and is attracted to females. He found out he was a genetic male at age 25, and reverted to living as a male.
* Sophie Ottaway, a British cloacal exstrophy male who was reassigned and raised as a female. Ottaway found out about her genetic sex at age 22. She retained female identity, although believes the reassignment was incorrect. She is attracted to women.

<text>Nathan &quot;Nati&quot; Seiberg (; born September 22, 1956) is an Israeli American theoretical physicist who works on quantum field theory and string theory. He is currently a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.

==Honors and awards==
He was recipient of a 1996 MacArthur Fellowship and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics in 1998. In July 2012, he was an inaugural awardee of the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, the creation of physicist and internet entrepreneur, Yuri Milner. In 2016, he was awarded the Dirac Medal of the ICTP. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences.

==Research==
His contributions include:
* Ian Affleck, Michael Dine, and Seiberg explored nonperturbative effects in supersymmetric field theories. This work demonstrated, for the first time, that nonperturbative effects in four-dimensional field theories do not respect the supersymmetry nonrenormalization theorems. This understanding led them to find four-dimensional models with dynamical supersymmetry breaking.
* In a series of papers, Michael Dine and Seiberg explored various aspects of string theory. In particular, Dine, Ryan Rohm, Seiberg, and Edward Witten proposed a supersymmetry breaking mechanism based on gluino condensation, Dine, Seiberg, and Witten showed that terms similar to Fayet–Iliopoulos D-terms arise in string theory, and Dine, Seiberg, X. G. Wen, and Witten studied instantons on the string worldsheet. 
* Gregory Moore and Seiberg studied Rational Conformal Field Theories. In the course of doing it, they invented modular tensor categories and described many of their properties. They also explored the relation between Witten’s Topological Chern–Simons theory and the corresponding Rational Conformal Field Theory. This body of work was later used in mathematics and in the study of topological phases of matter.
* In the 90’s, Seiberg realized the significance of holomorphy as the underlying reason for the perturbative supersymmetry nonrenormalization theorems and initiated a program to use it to find exact results in complicated field theories including several N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimension. These theories exhibit unexpected rich phenomena like confinement with and without chiral symmetry breaking and a new kind of electric-magnetic duality – Seiberg duality. Kenneth Intriligator and Seiberg studied many more models and summarized the subject in lecture notes. Later, Intriligator, Seiberg and David Shih used this understanding of the dynamics to present four-dimensional models with dynamical supersymmetry breaking in a metastable vacuum.
* Seiberg and Witten studied the dynamics of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories – Seiberg–Witten theory. They found exact expressions for several quantities of interest. These shed new light on interesting phenomena like confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and electric-magnetic duality. This insight was used by Witten to derive the Seiberg–Witten invariants. Later, Seiberg and Witten extended their work to the four-dimensional N=2 theory compactified to three dimensions.
* Intriligator and Seiberg found a new kind of duality in three-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric theories, which is reminiscent of the well-known 2D mirror symmetry – 3D mirror symmetry. 
*In a series of papers with various collaborators, Seiberg studied many supersymmetric theories in three, four, five, and six dimensions. The three-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories and their dualities were shown to be related to the four-dimensional N=1 theories. And surprising five-dimensional theories with N=2 supersymmetries were discovered and analyzed.
*As part of his work on the BFSS matrix model, Seiberg discovered little string theories. These are limits of string theory without gravity that are not local quantum field theories.
* Seiberg and Witten identified a particular low-energy limit (Seiberg–Witten limit) of theories containing open strings in which the dynamics becomes that of noncommutative quantum field theory – a field theory on a non-commutative geometry. They also presented a map (Seiberg–Witten map) between standard gauge theories and gauge theories on a noncommutative space. Shiraz Minwalla, Mark Van Raamsdonk and Seiberg uncovered a surprising mixing between short-distance and long-distance phenomena in these field theories on a noncommutative space. Such mixing violates the standard picture of the renormalization group. They referred to this phenomenon as UV/IR mixing.
*Davide Gaiotto, Anton Kapustin, Seiberg, and Brian Willett introduced the notion of higher-form global symmetries and studied some of their properties and applications.

<doc id="645174" wikidata="Q7345814" url="?curid=645174" title="Robert Irwin (artist)">
<text>Robert Walter Irwin (September 12, 1928 – October 25, 2023) was an American installation artist who explored perception and the conditional in art, often through site-specific, architectural interventions that alter the physical, sensory and temporal experience of space.

Irwin began his career as a painter in the 1950s, but in the 1960s shifted to installation work, becoming a pioneer whose work helped to define the aesthetics and conceptual issues of the West Coast Light and Space movement. His early works often employed light and veils of scrim to transform gallery and museum spaces, but from 1975 until his death, he also incorporated landscape projects into his practice. Irwin conceived over fifty-five site-specific projects, at institutions including the Getty Center (1992–98), (1999–2003), and the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas (2001–16). The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles mounted the first retrospective of his work in 1993; in 2008, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego presented another, spanning fifty years of his career. Irwin received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1976, a MacArthur Fellowship in March 1984, and was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2007. He lived and worked in San Diego, California.

== Beginnings ==
Robert Walter Irwin was born on September 12, 1928, in Long Beach, California, to Robert Irwin and Goldie Anderberg Irwin. He grew up in the Baldwin Hills area of Los Angeles, and graduated from Dorsey High School. After serving in the United States Army from 1946 to 1947, he attended several art institutes: Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles from 1948 to 1950, Jepson Art Institute in 1951, and Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles from 1952 to 1954. He spent the next two years living in Europe and North Africa. Between the years 1957–1958, he taught at the Chouinard Art Institute.
== Work ==
In 1977, Robert Irwin wrote the following about himself:
&quot;I began as a painter in the middle of nowhere with few questions...My first real question concerned the arbitrariness of my paintings… I used my paintings as a step-by-step process, each new series of works acting in direct response to those questions raised by the previous series. I first questioned the mark as meaning and then even as focus; I then questioned the frame as containment, the edge as the beginning and end of what I see...consider the possibility that nothing ever really transcends its immediate environment...I tried to respond directly to the quality of each situation I was in, not to change it wholesale into a new or ideal environment, but to attend directly to the nature of how it already was. How is it that a space could ever come to be considered empty when it is filled with real and tactile events?&quot; (Robert Irwin, 1977)
Irwin&#x27;s notion of art derived from a series of experiential perceptions. As an abstract, open-minded thinker, he presented experience first as perception or sense. He concluded that a sense of knowing, or ability to identify, helped to clarify perception. For example,

 &quot;We know the sky&#x27;s blueness even before we know it as &quot;blue&quot;, let alone as &quot;sky.&quot;

Irwin explained later that the conception of an abstract thought occurs in the mind, through the concept of self. Following, the physical form is then recognized, communicating the form to the community. Then, the Objective compound occurs, delineating behavioral norms and artistic norms, becoming identifiable. Then the boundaries and axioms introduce logic and reasoning and decisions can be made: either inductive or deductive. Formalism follows, proving and convincing a decision about the object being perceived. The study done by Irwin suggested that:
&quot;…all ideas and values have their roots in experience,… they can be held separate at any point and developed directly on the grounds of function and use, both that they in fact remain relative to the condition of both our subjective and objective being.&quot;
Irwin&#x27;s philosophy defined his idea of art as a series of aesthetic inquiries, an opportunity for cultural innovation, a communicative interaction with society, and as compounded historical development.

In his book &quot;Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees&quot;, Lawrence Weschler documents Irwin&#x27;s process from his early days as a youngster in Southern California to his emergence as a leader in the post-abstraction art world. Weschler describes the mystifying and often enchanting quality of these works in his book&#x27;s cover notes:

:&quot;In May 1980, Robert Irwin returned to Market Street in Venice, California to the block where he had kept a studio until 1970, the year he abandoned studio work altogether. Melinda Wyatt was opening a gallery in the building next door to his former work space and invited Irwin to create an installation.&quot;

:&quot;He cleaned out the large rectangular room, adjusted the skylights, painted the walls an even white, and then knocked out the wall facing the street, replacing it with a sheer, semi-transparent white scrim. The room seemed to change its aspect with the passing day: people came and sat on the opposite curb, watching, sometimes for hours at time.&quot;

:&quot;The piece was up for two weeks in one of the more derelict beachfront neighborhoods of Los Angeles: no one so much as laid a hand on it.&quot;

Because of the ephemeral or subtle nature of his work, this book became not just an introduction but, for many artists and art students, the primary way that Irwin&#x27;s work was experienced. He told Jori Finkel of the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2007 that people still came up to him at lectures for book autographs. In that article, Michael Govan, the director of LACMA who had previously commissioned Irwin to &quot;design our experience&quot; of said he believes the book &quot;has convinced more young people to become artists than the Velvet Underground has created rockers.&quot;

=== Painting ===
Irwin&#x27;s early work began with painting. In 1959, he painted a series of hand-held objects and exhibited for the second time, as an individual exhibitor, at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. The following year, 1960, he was asked to exhibit there again as well as at the Pasadena Art Museum. By this time, he began a continuous series of experiments. In 1962, he began teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles and exhibited at the Ferus Gallery again. That year, he began his line paintings. He exhibited at the Ferus Gallery in 1964 and presented a different study, his dot paintings.

Between 1966 and 1967, he began painting aluminum discs. He was invited back as an individual exhibitor to The Pace Gallery in New York City. In 1968, he began teaching at the University of California, Irvine. For the next two years, he started his work with clear acrylic discs, white convex structures fixed to the wall and illuminated by lamps. In 1970, he began his work on &quot;Columns&quot;, a series of clear acrylic columns. In 1972, he began his study on &quot;sightlines&quot; and &quot;places&quot; in the Southwest.

=== Light works ===
Irwin first used fluorescent light in the 1970s. His site-conditioned installation &quot;Excursus: Homage to the Square3&quot;, a meditation on the painter Josef Albers and his explorations of color relationships, was presented at Dia:Chelsea between 1998 and 2000. It consists of 18 small rooms, divided by walls of tautly stretched scrim; the light in each room, its value depending on the distance from the windows, is enhanced by four white-and-colored double fluorescent bulbs, each hung vertically at the center of each wall. In 2015, it was reinstalled at where it was on view through 2017. For a 2015 exhibition at Pace Gallery in New York City, Irwin installed rows of columnar lights, coating the different tubes with colored gels that alter the transmission of light.

His later exhibitions included: &quot;Unlights&quot; at Kayne Griffin in Los Angeles, January 9 – February 27, 2021 and &quot;Light and Space&quot; commissioned by Light Art Space (LAS) and displayed at Kraftwerk Berlin from December 5, 2021 to January 30, 2022. &quot;Irwin&#x27;s new works are composed from unlit six-foot fluorescent lights mounted to fixtures and installed in vertical rows directly on the wall. The glass tubes are covered in layers of opulently colored translucent gels and thin strips of electrical tape, allowing the reflective surfaces of unlit glass and anodized aluminum to interact with ambient illumination in the surrounding space and produce shifting patterns of shadow and chromatic tonality. Reflecting his recent turn toward the perceptual possibilities of unlit bulbs, Irwin&#x27;s new body of work expands the range of possibilities for how we experience sensations of rhythm, pulsation, expansion and intensity, while continuing the artist&#x27;s long-standing interest in registering the immediacy of our own presence in space.&quot;

=== Installations ===
From 1968 Irwin focused on the site itself by creating installations in rooms, gardens, parks, museums, and various urban locales. Influenced, in particular, by the paintings of John McLaughlin, Irwin and other Light and Space artists became curious about pushing the boundaries of art and perception, in the 1970s Irwin left studio work to pursue installation art that dealt directly with light and space: the basis of visual perception, in both outdoor and modified interior sites. These installations allowed for an open exploration for artist and viewer of an altered experience created by manipulating the context of environment rather than remaining with the confines of an individual work of art. Other artists involved in the Light and Space movement include John McCracken, James Turrell, Peter Alexander, Larry Bell, Craig Kauffman, Doug Wheeler, and Maria Nordman.

In 1970, the Museum of Modern Art invited Irwin to create an installation. Using the entire project space, Irwin suspended a white scrim 10 feet from the ground and attached shimmering stainless steel wires to the wall. In 1971 the Walker Art Center commissioned the artist to create &quot;Untitled (Slant/Light/Volume)&quot; for the inaugural exhibition of its Edward Larrabee Barnes-designed building. Suspended between the floor and ceiling, his &quot;Full Room Skylight - Scrim V&quot; (1972/2022) comprises two sheets of translucent fabric stretched in a “V” shape across two connected galleries; from overhead, the fabric is illuminated by abundant natural light beaming through the skylights, both concealing and revealing the surrounding architecture depending on variables such as brightness, time of day, and the viewer&#x27;s vantage point. For &quot;Soft Wall&quot;, a 1974 installation at Pace Gallery in New York City, Irwin simply cleaned and painted a rectangular gallery and hung a thin, translucent white theater scrim eighteen inches in front of one of the long walls, creating the effect of an empty room in which one wall seemed permanently out of focus.

A permanent wall installation in the entrance corridor of the Allen Memorial Art Museum, the dimensions of &quot;Untitled&quot; (1980) exactly repeat those of the deep-set windows just opposite. In the early 1980s, Irwin was invited to participate as a collaborating artist in designs for the rejuvenation and improvement of the Miami International Airport. In 1997 he transformed a room that overlooks the Pacific at the La Jolla branch of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. To celebrate its 125th anniversary, the Indianapolis Museum of Art commissioned Irwin to create &quot;Light and Space III&quot; (2008), thereby becoming the first U.S. museum to have a permanent indoor installation of the artist. For the piece, Irwin arranged fluorescent light bulbs in an irregular grid pattern across the walls surrounding the escalators, with a veil of scrim framing each side; as museum visitors go up and down between floors, they move through the piece. &quot;Trifecta (Joe&#x27;s Bar &amp; Grill)&quot;, a three-story permanent light installation at Swiss Re&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was inaugurated in 2012.

In late 2013, a 33-foot-tall acrylic column by Irwin was unveiled at the San Diego Federal Courthouse, where the artist worked with his longtime friends and collaborators, architect Martin Poirer and landscape architect Andrew Spurlock, on the courthouse&#x27;s outdoor plaza. The three-story-tall acrylic column, built decades ago but never given a proper home due to a series of unforeseen circumstances, refracts light and cast colors as the sun moves through the lobby. The fabrication of the columns and the technical issues related to the material, were all executed by Jack Brogan, a central character in the evolution of the techniques in the Light and Space Movement. The challenge and technique of polishing the columns to the required transparency was invented by Brogan and remains a high water mark in the field.
For the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Irwin created an outdoor installation of primal palm trees (&quot;Primal Palm Garden&quot;, 2008–2010) as well as an indoor 36-foot-long fluorescent light sculpture, &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; (2013), which glows behind them 24 hours a day.

After having been working and reworking his ideas to create a giant installation for the Chinati Foundation since the early 2000s, Irwin&#x27;s installation in Marfa, Texas — a U-shape construction about 10,000 square feet — began in early 2015 and be completed and opened to the public in 2016. The installation, situated at the building that had housed the former Army barracks&#x27; hospital, will be the first major installation added to the Chinati Foundation since 2004 as well as the first freestanding structure designed by Irwin that is devoted solely to his work.

Other installations by Irwin included; &quot;Fractured Light – Partial Scrim – Eye Level&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1970–1971); &quot;Black Line Room Division + Extended Forms&quot; at the Whitney Museum, New York (1977); &quot;48 Shadow Planes&quot; at the Old Post Office Pavilion, Washington, D.C. (1983); &quot;Ascending&quot; at the Musee d&#x27; Art Moderne de Ville, Paris, France (1994); and &quot;Double Diamond&quot; at the Musée d&#x27;Art Contemporain, Lyon, France (1997–1998).

=== Landscape projects ===
Irwin moved on to landscape projects after developing a stylistic move towards experiential space, projecting what he learned about line, color, and most of all, light onto the built environment. From 1975 forward, Irwin conceived of fifty-five site projects. &quot;9 Spaces 9 Trees&quot; (1980–3) originally was commissioned in 1980 for the rooftop of the Public Safety Building by the Seattle Arts Commission; it was re-imagined in 2007 and situated on campus at the University of Washington. Irwin&#x27;s &quot;Filigreed Line&quot; (1979) made for Wellesley College in Massachusetts, consists of a stainless steel line, running along a ridge of grass near a lake, in which a pattern of leaflike forms is cut. His 1983 work &quot;Two Running Violet V Forms&quot;, two crossing blue-violet, plastic coated wire fences fixed with high poles, is featured as part of the Stuart Collection of public artwork on the campus of the University of California, San Diego. For &quot;Sentinel Plaza&quot; (1990) in the Pasadena Civic Center District, Irwin chose small desert plants and cacti. He later consulted on the master plan for , creating, in particular, the design and landscaping of the outdoor spaces, and the entrance building and the window design.

Irwin later designed and developed the Central Garden at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, built in 1997. In the Central Garden, Irwin&#x27;s concept of integrating experiential relationships to the built environment is abundantly clear. Those experiential elements fill the space. This project is widely praised for its design and flow. The design features a natural ravine and tree-lined walkway that leads the visitor through an experience of sights, sounds, and scents. He selected everything in the garden to accentuate the interplay of light, color, and reflection. Planning began in 1992, as a key part of the Getty Center project. Since the Center opened in 1997, the Central Garden has evolved as its plants have grown. Irwin&#x27;s statement, &quot;Always changing, never twice the same,&quot; is carved into the plaza floor, reminding visitors of the ever-changing nature of this living work of art. To the artist&#x27;s dismay, a 1950s Fernand Léger sculpture was placed on the garden&#x27;s plaza.

Irwin later completed the second phase of the installation of a primordial Palm Garden at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art which began in 2007. The Palm Garden is arranged in a &quot;T&quot; shape with the east–west axis running between and around, both the Broad Contemporary Art Museum and the Resnick Pavilion. The north–south axis terminates with a grid of date palms serving as a counterpoint to artist Chris Burden&#x27;s &quot;Urban Light&quot; installation. Irwin was long intrigued with how palm trees capture and reflect Southern California light; designing the Palm Garden provided Irwin with an opportunity to work with both the phenomenal and cultural perceptions of palms. Individual species of palms are planted in Cor-Ten boxes, modern and formalized versions of common wood nursery boxes. The sculptural containers make reference to the pedestal bases traditionally signifying art objects. Irwin&#x27;s use of palm trees considers the ubiquitous and iconic connection between the palm tree and images of Los Angeles.

== Exhibitions ==
Irwin first exhibited paintings at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1957. The exhibit was called &quot;Artists of Los Angeles and Vicinity.&quot; The same year, he participated in the 57th Annual Exhibition of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. That same year, he had his first individual exhibition at the Felix Landau Gallery in Los Angeles.

In 1965, he participated in an exhibition called &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at another called &quot;XIII&quot; in Bienal de São Paulo, Brazil. In 1966, he exhibited both as an individual and with Kenneth Price at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and as an individual exhibitor later at The Pace Gallery in New York City. In 1969, Irwin exhibited with Doug Wheeler at the Fort Worth Art Center in Fort Worth, Texas. In 1970, he first exhibited scrim &quot;volumes&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. For the next five years, he exhibited individually at the following locations: the Pace Gallery in New York City, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Minuzo and Ace Galleries in Los Angeles, the Fogg Art Museum on the Harvard University Campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio&quot;,&quot; the University of California at Santa Barbara, Fort Worth Art Center, and Palomar College in San Marcos, California. He participated in several joint exhibitions: &quot;Transparency, Reflection, Light, Space: Four Artists&quot; at the UCLA Art Gallery in Los Angeles and &quot;Some Recent American Art&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art exhibition for Australia. He also exhibited internationally: &quot;Kompas IV&quot; at Stedelijk Museum in Eindhoven, with other artists (Larry Bell and Doug Wheeler), at the Tate Gallery in London, and Documenta in Kassel in Germany&quot;.&quot;

In 1993, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles mounted the first comprehensive retrospective of Irwin&#x27;s career; the exhibition later traveled to the Kölnischer Kunstverein, the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía. In 2008, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego presented another comprehensive retrospective spanning fifty years of Irwin&#x27;s career.

== Recognition ==
Irwin was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1984, making him the first artist to receive the five-year fellowship, which lasted until 1989. He was also the recipient of a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship (1976), the Chaloner award, the James D. Phelan award (1954), and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation medal in architecture awarded by the University of Virginia School of Architecture (2009). He held Honorary Doctorates from the San Francisco Art Institute (1978) and the Otis College of Art and Design (1992). Irwin was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2007. That same year he had a residency at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego.

<text>Kingdom Hospital (sometimes known as Stephen King&#x27;s Kingdom Hospital) is a thirteen-episode television series based on Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, developed by horror writer Stephen King in 2004 for American television. While initially conceived as a miniseries, it was later changed into a regular television series (albeit one that lasted one season). It was first aired on ABC on March 3 and concluded on July 15, 2004 after being put on hold during NBA playoffs.

&quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; has been compared to the paranormal hospital drama series &quot;All Souls&quot;, another production which had been inspired by Von Trier&#x27;s &quot;The Kingdom.&quot;

==Plot==
The story tells of the fictional Kingdom Hospital located in Lewiston, Maine, built on the site of a mill that manufactured military uniforms during the American Civil War. Previously, a hospital known as the &quot;Old Kingdom&quot; had been built on the site, but it burned down. The current hospital is known as the &quot;New Kingdom&quot;. The hospital&#x27;s &quot;turbulent&quot; nature seems to reflect its ominous logo, a crimson stylized dagger, predicting what will come.

A psychic named Mrs. Druse has checked into the hospital numerous times and is taken by the staff to be a hypochondriac. She asks for the assistance of the cynical yet compassionate Dr. Hook to uncover the truth about the hospital and the mysterious spirits who haunt it – including a sinister teenage boy, a young girl who had died in the fire that burned the mill down, and a strange animal that follows and protects the young girl, who calls it Antubis (it is similar to a giant anteater, but whose long snout opens up to a set of jagged teeth).

Elsewhere, Peter Rickman, a painter who is admitted to the hospital following a road accident (with severe injuries to his skull and spine) begins to discover the ghastly goings-on while he lies comatose in room 426.

Other subplots included the initiation of arrogant chief of surgery Dr. Stegman into the secret society known as the &#x27;Keepers&#x27;, and the challenged-at-every-turn flirtation between young Dr. Elmer Traff and sleep doctor Dr. Lona Massingale.

A recurring plot line is the secret society of the hospital &quot;The Keepers&quot;.

==Cast==

===The hospital staff===
* Andrew McCarthy as Dr. Hook, a surgeon and a member of the Keepers.
* Bruce Davison as Dr. Stegman, a neurosurgeon who is on the verge of being initiated into the Keepers, and is facing a malpractice suit. 
* Meagen Fay as Dr. Brenda Abelson, Dr. Stegman friend and love interest.
* Ed Begley Jr. as Dr. Jesse James, Kingdom Hospital&#x27;s Chief of Staff and member of the Keepers, who spends his time initiating &quot;Operation: Morning Air&quot;.
* Jamie Harrold as Dr. Elmer Traff, a young surgeon and son of Dr. Louis Traff. He is smitten with Dr. Massingale and pursues her romantically.
* Sherry Miller as Dr. Lona Massingale, the enigmatic sleep doctor, and love interest of Dr. Traff.

* Julian Richings as Otto, a security guard. Otto often accompanied by Blondi, an intelligent German Shepherd Dog.

* Jodelle Micah Ferland as Mary Jensen, the ghost of a girl murdered to cover up the arson of the mill in the 1860s; she is a symbol of death in Kingdom Hospital.

===Guest stars===
Charles Martin Smith, Wayne Newton, Lorena Gale (&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;), Bruce Harwood (&quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;), Evangeline Lilly (&quot;Lost&quot;), Tygh Runyan (&quot;The L Word&quot;), Peter Wingfield (&quot;&quot;), Callum Keith Rennie (&quot;Due South&quot;), Christine Willes (&quot;Dead Like Me&quot;), William B. Davis (&quot;The X-Files&quot;), and Stephen King (&quot;writer&quot;) all have guest appearances.

==Production==
King and producer Mark Carliner discovered the source material, the five-hour Danish television movie called &quot;Riget&quot; (&quot;Kingdom&quot; in English), while searching through a video store during the making of the 1997 TV miniseries adaptation of King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Shining&quot;. They tried to buy the rights to the Danish original, only to learn that Columbia Pictures had acquired them and intended to make a theatrical movie. After five years, Columbia concluded the work could not be adapted in two-hour form and sold the rights in exchange for the rights to King&#x27;s novella &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden&quot; from the 1990 book &quot;Four Past Midnight&quot;.

This was the first time he had adapted someone else&#x27;s work rather than his own from scratch. King kept most of the characters and dark humor in place, but added a new central character named Peter Rickman who was based on his own personal experience after being hit by a minivan. King described the finished product as &quot;the thing I like best out of all the things I&#x27;ve done.&quot; The series is known for its tangential plots and characters who recur throughout, as King called it a &quot;novelization for television&quot;. King committed to write the story line for the following year, should ABC decide to continue the series.

While written as a miniseries, many fans wanted it to be renewed for a second season, and Stephen King had a storyboard written out for one. After incredibly successful ratings for the first episode, the highest rating drama debut of the year on ABC, ratings plummeted thereafter. Despite being cancelled, the series did receive Emmy Award nominations for Special Visual Effects for a Series and Main Title Design.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
The show received mixed reviews from critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review argued that the &quot;plot unfolds disjointedly and without enough suspense.&quot; CNN felt the premiere was promising and the &quot;jittery pacing and oddball sensibility&quot; were reminiscent of &quot;Twin Peaks.&quot; The &quot;USA Today&quot; review stated that the show &quot;does have a few frightening moments, but they don&#x27;t compensate for the lackluster performances, the absence of character development, humor or pacing, or the wild fluctuations in tone.&quot;

The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the series a 46% approval rating based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 5.90/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Stephen King may bring autobiographical flourishes to this remake of a Danish series, but the self-indulgent &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; lacks the horror maestro&#x27;s penchant for good scares.&quot;

The entire series was released on DVD. The DVD includes four short featurettes that cover the making of the miniseries:
*&quot;Patients and Doctors: The Cast of Kingdom Hospital&quot; is a segment running approximately 14 minutes that takes a look at the &#x27;whys&#x27; and &#x27;wherefores&#x27; of the casting decisions.
*&quot;Inside The Walls: The Making of Kingdom Hospital&quot; is a segment running a quarter of an hour that gives us a look at the thought process behind getting the actual miniseries made from its origins as Von Trier&#x27;s original Danish production through King&#x27;s &#x27;re-imagining&#x27; of that work. 
*&quot;Designing Kingdom Hospital: A Tour&quot; is a seven-minute piece on the set design. 
*&quot;The Magic of Antubis&quot; is an eight-minute look at the creation of the anteater with thoughts from the director and the chief effects supervisor.

In addition to the four featurettes, there is also a commentary track on the first episode with King, director Craig Baxley, producer Mark Carliner and visual effects supervisor James Tichenor.

<doc id="645178" wikidata="Q911577" url="?curid=645178" title="Dungeness">
<text>Dungeness (, ) is a headland on the coast of Kent, England, formed largely of a shingle beach in the form of a cuspate foreland. It shelters a large area of low-lying land, Romney Marsh. Dungeness spans Dungeness Nuclear Power Station, the hamlet of Dungeness, and an ecological site at the same location. It lies within the civil parish of Lydd.

==Etymology==
Dungeness&#x27;s name means &quot;the headland at Denge&quot;, referring to nearby Denge Marsh. The marsh is first mentioned in 774 as &quot;Dengemersc&quot;. Its name may mean &quot;marsh of the pasture district&quot;, from Old English &quot;denn *gē mersc&quot;, or else &quot;marsh with manured land&quot;, from Old English &quot;dyncge mersc&quot;.

==Nature==

===Ecology===
Dungeness is one of the largest expanses of shingle in Europe. It is of international conservation importance for its geomorphology, plant and invertebrate communities and bird life. This is recognised and protected mostly through its conservation designations as a national nature reserve (NNR), a Special Protection Area (SPA), a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and part of the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of Dungeness, Romney Marsh and Rye Bay.

There is a remarkable variety of wildlife living at Dungeness, with over 600 different types of plants: a third of all those found in Britain. It is one of the best places in Britain to find invertebrates such as moths, bees, beetles, and spiders; many of these are very rare, some found nowhere else in Britain.

The flooded gravel pits on Denge Beach, both brackish and fresh water, provide an important refuge for many migratory and coastal bird species. The RSPB has a bird reserve there, and every year thousands of bird watchers visit the peninsula and its bird observatory.

One of the most remarkable features of the site is an area known as &quot;the patch&quot; or, by anglers, as &quot;the boil&quot;. The waste hot water from the Dungeness nuclear power stations is pumped into the sea through two outfall pipes, enriching the biological productivity of the sea bed and attracting seabirds from miles around.

Beach fishing is popular at Dungeness, with the area being a nationally recognised cod fishing venue in the winter.

It has previously been reported that Dungeness had such low rainfall as to qualify as the only desert in the UK. However, a spokesperson for the Met Office refuted this in 2015.

===Climate===
The climate in Dungeness is mild and generally warm and temperate. There is significant rainfall throughout the year. The average annual temperature is . Precipitation averages annually. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

==Buildings==

===Lighthouses===

There have been seven lighthouses at Dungeness, five high and two low, with the fifth high one still fully operational today. At first, only a beacon was used to warn sailors, but this was replaced by a wooden lighthouse in 1615 which was tall. As the sea retreated, this had to be replaced in 1635 by a new lighthouse nearer to the water&#x27;s edge known as Lamplough&#x27;s Tower which was around high.

As more shingle was thrown up, a new and more up-to-date lighthouse was built near the sea in 1792 by Samuel Wyatt. This lighthouse was high and of the same design as the third Eddystone Lighthouse. From the mid-19th century, it was painted black with a white band to make it more visible in daylight; similar colours have featured on the subsequent lighthouses here. This lighthouse was demolished in 1904, but the lighthouse keepers&#x27; accommodation, built in a circle around the base of the tower, still exists.

In 1901, the building of the fourth lighthouse, the High Light Tower, started. It was first lit on 31 March 1904 and still stands today. It is no longer in use as a lighthouse but is open as a visitor attraction. It is a circular brick structure, high and in diameter at ground level. It has 169 steps and gives visitors a good view of the shingle beach.

As the sea receded further, and after building the nuclear power station which obscured the light of the 1904 lighthouse, a fifth lighthouse, Dungeness Lighthouse was built.

===Power stations===


There are two nuclear power stations at Dungeness, identified as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, the first built in 1965 and the second in 1983. They are within a wildlife sanctuary designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and birds flourish in the warmer water created by the station&#x27;s outflow.

The older power station closed on 31 December 2006, while the current owner EDF Energy announced in June 2021 that the newer station would not resume operations, which had halted in September 2018, and would move into the defuelling phase with immediate effect. 

There is no longer a public visitor centre, and tours of the station are unavailable.

===The hamlet===

In addition to the power station and lighthouse, there is a collection of dwellings. Most are wooden weatherboard beach houses, but there are also around 30 houses converted from old railway coaches in the 1920s. These houses are owned and occupied by fishermen whose boats lie on the beach. Closer to the main road, there is a large building – comprising five conjoined homes – previously tenanted by coastguards. There are more houses around the site of the power stations. There are two public houses: the Britannia and the Pilot, the latter being served by the Pilot Inn railway station from 1928 to 1977. Fresh seafood can be purchased from several outlets across the shingle.

A notable house is Prospect Cottage, formerly owned by the late artist and film director Derek Jarman. The cottage is painted black, with a poem, part of John Donne&#x27;s &quot;The Sunne Rising&quot;, written on one side in black lettering. The garden, reflecting the bleak, windswept landscape of the peninsula, is made of pebbles, driftwood, scrap metal and a few hardy plants.

==Transport==
Dungeness is accessible by two roads, one along the coast from New Romney to the north, and another from Lydd to the north-west. Both roads converge near the Pilot public house, from where a single road runs a mile (1.6 km) south to the tip of Dungeness.

Dungeness is also served by the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway, a gauge light railway that covers the distance from Hythe. The line, which had opened to New Romney in 1927, was extended to Dungeness station a year later. It still provides a service for tourists. 

The peninsula has a second, standard gauge railway, but this is now truncated adjacent to the Dungeness Road and only used to carry waste from the power stations. It formerly linked Dungeness (and, via a separate branch, New Romney) to a junction with the Marshlink Line at Appledore. The Dungeness section was closed to passengers on 4 July 1937 and it was truncated on 6 March 1967.

Lydd Airport, sometimes known as London Ashford Airport, lies just to the north-west of Dungeness. Despite opposition, largely due to its proximity to the unique landscape of Dungeness, the airport received permission in 2014 to extend its runway to allow it to handle fully loaded aircraft up to the size of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A319.

==Defence uses==

The beach and marshes have been used for military training and include marked &quot;danger areas&quot;. In World War I Lydd Camp was here.

Denge, a former Royal Air Force site at the northern edge of the Dungeness headland, is the site of a set of acoustic mirrors, known as the &quot;Listening Ears&quot;. Built between 1928 and 1930, the three massive concrete structures formed an experimental early warning system that aimed to detect invading aircraft by focusing sound waves. The site was chosen as being one of the quietest in Britain. Their different forms are evidence of their experimental nature; they were not particularly effective and were abandoned when radar became available. The site is now managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

In 1944, some of the world&#x27;s first underwater oil pipelines were laid between Dungeness and France in Operation Pluto. The lines from Dungeness were part of a network called &quot;Dumbo&quot; and ran to Ambleteuse in France.

==Dungeness Tudor ship==

In 2022 the well-preserved remains of a 16th-century ship were found in Denge quarry at Dungeness.

==Media appearances==
Dungeness appears quite often in music videos, album covers and adverts. It featured on the cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;A Collection of Great Dance Songs&quot;. British band The Soup Dragons shot the videos for their top 5 1990 hit &#x27;&quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot;, and follow-up top 20 1991 hit &quot;Mother Universe&quot; on Dungeness; and there have also been several photo shoots by the band in the area.

The shingle beach and fishermen&#x27;s shacks feature extensively in the Lighthouse Family promotional video for their 1998 song &quot;High&quot;. The acoustic mirror at Dungeness is featured on the cover of the album &quot;Ether Song&quot; by the British indie band Turin Brakes. Dungeness appears on the covers of albums as diverse as &quot;So much for the city&quot; by The Thrills and &quot;Aled&quot; by Aled Jones. The Prodigy&#x27;s single &quot;Invaders Must Die&quot; video was filmed here and shows both the acoustic mirrors and the lighthouse. In 2011, the music video for the song Walk the River by British band Guillemots was filmed on the headland. In 2012, Nicki Minaj&#x27;s single Freedom was filmed on the beach and with the acoustic mirrors. The music video for Lithuanian DJ Ten Walls&#x27; hit single &quot;Walking With Elephants&quot; was shot on the headland and in the surrounding sea and featured many of the areas prominent landmarks. In 2016, The Wholls also filmed the music video for their single &quot;X21&quot;. In 2020, the music video for Nothing But Thieves&#x27;s single Impossible was partly filmed on the beach.

Athlete have a song on the album &quot;Vehicles and Animals&quot; called &quot;Dungeness&quot; which is about the area. Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly mentions Dungeness and the lighthouse in his song &quot;Lighthouse Keeper&quot;. The Kent-based hardcore punk band November Coming Fire released a 2006 album entitled &quot;Dungeness&quot;, featuring a track called &quot;Powerstation&quot; which included a recording of waves on the beach, and Scottish folk band Trembling Bells named their album &quot;Dungeness&quot; too.

In television, the Dungeness landscape, the lighthouse and the power station have been used on digital channel E4 at the beginning and end of advertising breaks. It was used as a backdrop for the ITV drama &quot;The Poison Tree&quot;. It featured in an episode of the BBC detective serial &quot;The Inspector Lynley Mysteries&quot; and in March 2007 was the setting for a major part of an &quot;EastEnders&quot; special. Famously in January 1971 the BBC filmed the 4-part &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Claws of Axos&quot; in Dungeness. Starring Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor, the story featured an alien space craft burying itself in the shingle of Dungeness beach. The 1981 fantasy film &quot;Time Bandits&quot; shot its &quot;Time of Legends&quot; sequence on the beach, and Dungeness was used to film a scene in Danny Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Trance&quot;.

Much of the Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;I Want You&quot; was set in and around Dungeness: the lead character&#x27;s home was one of the wooden beach huts. The Derek Jarman avant-garde 1990 film &quot;The Garden&quot; was set and filmed in Dungeness.

<text>Rafael Urbano Lugo Colina (born August 12, 1962) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher from 1985 through 1990. Listed at 6&#x27; 0&quot; (1.83 m), 185 lb. (84 k), he batted and threw right handed.

Born in Punto Fijo, Falcón, Lugo was originally signed by the California Angels organization as a free agent in 1982. He entered the majors in 1985 with the Angels, pitching for them four years before joining the Montreal Expos (1989) and the Detroit Tigers (1990).

Lugo posted a 3-4 record and a 3.69 earned run average in 20 pitching appearances In his rookie season, including 10 starts and one complete game, striking out 42 and walking 29, while allowing 86 hits in 83.0 innings of work.

He pitched sparingly after that, bouncing up and down between the majors and minors for the rest of his career, including a four-year stint in the Mexican League with the Charros de Jalisco (1991–1994), while managing the team in the 1994 season.

His father, of the same name, was a successful Minor League pitcher, having both pitched for the Leones del Caracas of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.

Both father and son as well as catcher Bo Díaz were part of an extremely unlikely event spanning thirteen years. On January 6, 1973, Díaz was behind the plate for the elder Lugo’s no-hitter, as the Caracas club defeated the Tiburones de La Guaira, 6–0. Thirteen years later, on January 24, 1986, Díaz caught Lugo Jr. as he threw his own no-hitter, in a 4–0 Caracas victory over La Guaira.

In 2009, Lugo gained induction into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum as part of their sixth class.

<doc id="645188" wikidata="Q5324847" url="?curid=645188" title="E ticket">
<text>An E ticket (officially an E coupon) was a type of admission ticket used at the Disneyland and Magic Kingdom theme parks before 1994, where it admitted the bearer to the newest, most advanced, or popular rides and attractions.

It is now commonly used to describe a category of top tier and cutting edge theme park attractions. The term is especially common in describing Disney attractions of such a tier.

==Origin==
When Disneyland opened in 1955, visitors purchased an admission ticket to the park at the main gate booths and then purchased separate admission inside for each attraction. Less than three months after opening, Disney began selling &quot;Value Books&quot;, each of which contained several of each coupon labeled &quot;A&quot; through &quot;C&quot;, to supplement the pay-per-ride system. Attractions were then designated as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, or &quot;C&quot; attractions, and visitors needed to either purchase a specified coupon from a nearby booth or present the discount coupon book with the correct coupon attached. As determined by Disney, &quot;A&quot; attractions were the smallest or least popular, &quot;B&quot; attractions were more popular and/or more advanced, and &quot;C&quot; attractions were the most popular and/or most advanced. In 1956, Disney introduced the &quot;D&quot; designation for the most popular attractions and upgraded several former &quot;C&quot; attractions including Jungle Cruise to &quot;D&quot;.

In June 1959, amid the completion of Disneyland&#x27;s first major expansion, Disney introduced the &quot;E&quot; designation for the park&#x27;s most popular attractions and made the new Submarine Voyage, Matterhorn Bobsleds, and Disneyland–Alweg Monorail &quot;E&quot; coupon attractions. Additionally, the Santa Fe &amp; Disneyland Railroad, Rocket to the Moon, Rainbow Ridge Pack Mules, Rainbow Mountain Stage Coaches, &quot;Mark Twain&quot; Riverboat, , Rafts to Tom Sawyer Island, and Jungle Cruise—all previously &quot;D&quot; rides—were upgraded to &quot;E&quot;. &quot;E&quot; remained the highest attraction/coupon designation for over 20 years. Several &quot;E&quot; attractions were added throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1971, the coupon system was duplicated at the Magic Kingdom when it opened.

The coupons had a face value for use on rides, with an &quot;A&quot; ticket worth $0.10, &quot;B&quot; $0.15, &quot;C&quot; $0.25, &quot;D&quot; $0.50, and &quot;E&quot;, $0.85. This meant one could ride any ride if the ticket or a combination of tickets met or exceeded the value of that ride, so one could overpay an &quot;A&quot; ticket ride with a &quot;B&quot; ticket or higher, or present an &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; ticket together instead of an &quot;E&quot; ticket.

The coupon system was gradually phased out with the introduction of &quot;passports&quot; (unlimited use tickets) beginning in the late 1970s. This was largely due to competition from Six Flags Magic Mountain, which, when it opened in 1971, allowed its visitors unlimited use of its attractions after paying the admission fee. By June 1982, coupons vanished entirely and were replaced by the present-day system where main gate admission entitles visitors to all rides and attractions, excluding coin-operated arcades.

==Modern usage==
From 1997 to 2004, Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom hosted &quot;hard ticket&quot; special events called &quot;E-Ride Nights&quot;, where a limited number of resort room guests (usually 5,000) were allowed to purchase special tickets that allowed them to stay in the park and ride some of the rides (typically those that had been, or would have been, E-ticket rides) for an extra three hours after the park had closed to other guests.

The term &quot;E ticket&quot; was for some time used to describe cutting-edge or top-tier amusement park attractions, especially Disney attractions of this caliber, and &quot;E-ticket ride&quot; is a colloquial term for an exhilarating experience. For example, a ride in the back of a fighter jet is an E-ticket ride. When Sally Ride flew on Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1983, she said to the Mission Control Center, &quot;Have you ever been to Disneyland? ... Well, this is definitely an E ticket.&quot; However, the term has become less common over the years since Disney stopped using lettered tickets for its rides.

In her 1984 song, &quot;The Homecoming Queen&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;, singer-songwriter Julie Brown compares the titular homecoming queen to Disneyland&#x27;s [fictional] Cinderella ride, describing both as &quot;definitely an E ticket&quot;. In his 1993 song &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic complains, &quot;well, this sure ain&#x27;t no E-ticket&quot;.

In the 1984 film &quot;Night of the Comet&quot; during the department store hostage scene, Willy, the gang&#x27;s leader, refers to the E ticket as he has the gun against Samantha&#x27;s head.

<doc id="645189" wikidata="Q1131025" url="?curid=645189" title="Copenhagen Consensus">
<text>Copenhagen Consensus is a project that seeks to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics, using cost–benefit analysis. It was conceived and organized around 2004 by Bjørn Lomborg, the author of &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; and the then director of the Danish government&#x27;s Environmental Assessment Institute.

The project is run by the Copenhagen Consensus Center, which is directed by Lomborg and was part of the Copenhagen Business School, but it is now an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation registered in the USA. The project considers possible solutions to a wide range of problems, presented by experts in each field. These are evaluated and ranked by a panel of economists. The emphasis is on rational prioritization by economic analysis. The panel is given an arbitrary budget constraint and instructed to use cost–benefit analysis to focus on a bottom line approach in solving/ranking presented problems. The approach is justified as a corrective to standard practice in international development, where, it is alleged, media attention and the &quot;court of public opinion&quot; results in priorities that are often far from optimal.

==History==
The project has held conferences in 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. The 2012 conference ranked bundled micronutrient interventions the highest priority, and the 2008 report identified supplementing vitamins for undernourished children as the world’s best investment. The 2009 conference, dealing specifically with global warming, proposed research into marine cloud whitening (ships spraying seawater into clouds to make them reflect more sunlight and thereby reduce temperature) as the top climate change priority, though climate change itself is ranked well below other world problems. In 2011 the Copenhagen Consensus Center carried out the Rethink HIV project together with the RUSH Foundation, to find smart solutions to the problem of HIV/AIDS. In 2007 looked into which projects would contribute most to welfare in Copenhagen Consensus for Latin America in cooperation with the Inter-American Development Bank.

The initial project was co-sponsored by the Danish government and &quot;The Economist&quot;. A book summarizing the Copenhagen Consensus 2004 conclusions, &quot;Global Crises, Global Solutions&quot;, edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by Cambridge University Press, followed by the second edition published in 2009 based on the 2008 conclusions.

==Copenhagen Consensus 2012==
In May 2012, the third global Copenhagen Consensus was held, gathering economists to analyze the costs and benefits of different approaches to tackling the world‘s biggest problems. The aim was to provide an answer to the question:
If you had $75bn for worthwhile causes, where should you start?
A panel including four Nobel laureates met in Copenhagen, Denmark, in May 2012. The panel’s deliberations were informed by thirty new economic research papers that were written just for the project by scholars from around the world.

=== Economists ===
The panel members were the following, four of whom are Nobel Laureate economists.
* Robert Mundell
* Nancy Stokey
* Thomas Schelling
* Vernon Smith
* Finn Kydland

=== Challenges ===
* Armed conflict 
* Biodiversity 
* Chronic disease 
* Climate Change 
* Education 
* Hunger and malnutrition 
* Infectious disease 
* Natural disasters 
* Population growth 
* Water and sanitation
In addition, the Center commissioned research on Corruption and trade barriers, but the Expert Panel did not rank these for Copenhagen Consensus 2012, because the solutions to these challenges are political rather than investment-related.

=== Outcome ===
Given the budget restraints, they found 16 investments worthy of investment (in descending order of desirability):

# Bundled micronutrient interventions to fight hunger and improve education
# Expanding the subsidy for malaria combination treatment
# Expanded childhood immunization coverage
# Deworming of schoolchildren, to improve educational and health outcomes
# Expanding tuberculosis treatment
# R&amp;D to Increase yield enhancements, to decrease hunger, fight biodiversity destruction, and lessen the effects of climate change
# Investing in effective early warning systems to protect populations against natural disaster
# Strengthening surgical capacity
# Hepatitis B immunization
# Using low‐Cost drugs in the case of acute heart attacks in poorer nations (these are already available in developed countries)
# Salt reduction campaign to reduce chronic disease
# Geo‐engineering R&amp;D into the feasibility of solar radiation management
# Conditional cash transfer for school attendance 
# Accelerated HIV vaccine R&amp;D
# Extended field trial of information campaigns on the benefits from schooling
# Borehole and public hand pump intervention

=== Slate ranking ===
During the days of the Copenhagen Consensus 2012 conference, a series of articles was published in Slate Magazine each about a challenge that was discussed, and Slate readers could make their own ranking, voting for the solutions which they thought were best. Slate readers&#x27; ranking corresponded with that of the Expert Panel on many points, including the desirability of bundled micronutrient intervention; however, the most striking difference was in connection with the problem of overpopulation. Family planning ranked highest on the Slate priority list, whereas it didn&#x27;t feature in the top 16 of the Expert Panel&#x27;s prioritisation.

== Copenhagen Consensus 2008 ==

===Economists===
&quot;Nobel Prize winners marked with (¤)&quot;
* Jagdish Bhagwati
* François Bourguignon
* Finn E. Kydland (¤)
* Robert Mundell (¤)
* Douglass North (¤)
* Vernon L. Smith (¤)
* Thomas Schelling (¤)
* Nancy Stokey

===Results===
In the Copenhagen Consensus 2008, the solutions for global problems have been ranked in the following order:

# Micronutrient supplements for children (vitamin A and zinc)
# The Doha development agenda
# Micronutrient fortification (iron and salt iodization)
# Expanded immunization coverage for children
# Biofortification
# Deworming and other nutrition programs at school
# Lowering the price of schooling
# Increase and improve girls’ schooling
# Community-based nutrition promotion
# Provide support for women’s reproductive role
# Heart attack acute management
# Malaria prevention and treatment
# Tuberculosis case finding and treatment
# R&amp;D in low-carbon energy technologies
# Bio-sand filters for household water treatment
# Rural water supply
# Conditional cash transfer
# Peace-keeping in post-conflict situations
# HIV combination prevention
# Total sanitation campaign
# Improving surgical capacity at district hospital level
# Microfinance
# Improved stove intervention to combat Air Pollution
# Large, multipurpose dam in Africa
# Inspection and maintenance of diesel vehicles
# Low sulfur diesel for urban road vehicles
# Diesel vehicle particulate control technology
# Tobacco tax
# R&amp;D and carbon dioxide emissions reduction
# Carbon dioxide emissions reduction

Unlike the 2004 results, these were not grouped into qualitative bands such as Good, Poor, etc.

Gary Yohe, one of the authors of the global warming paper, subsequently accused Lomborg of &quot;deliberate distortion of our conclusions&quot;, adding that &quot;as one of the authors of the Copenhagen Consensus Project&#x27;s principal climate paper, I can say with certainty that Lomborg is misrepresenting our findings thanks to a highly selective memory&quot;. Kåre Fog further pointed out that the future benefits of emissions reduction were discounted at a higher rate than for any of the other 27 proposals, stating &quot;so there is an obvious reason why the climate issue always is ranked last&quot; in Lomborg&#x27;s environmental studies.

In a subsequent joint statement settling their differences, Lomborg and Yohe agreed that the &quot;failure&quot; of Lomborg&#x27;s emissions reduction plan &quot;could be traced to faulty design&quot;.

==Climate Change Project==
In 2009, the Copenhagen convened an expert panel specifically to examine solutions to climate change. The process was similar to the 2004 and 2008 Copenhagen Consensus, involving papers by specialists considered by a panel of economists. The panel ranked 15 solutions, of which the top 5 were:
# Research into marine cloud whitening (involving ships spraying sea-water into clouds so as to reflect more sunlight and thereby reduce temperatures)
# Technology-led policy response
# Research into stratospheric aerosol injection (involving injected ?sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to reduce sunlight)
# Research into carbon storage
# Planning for adaptation

The benefits of the number 1 solution are that if the research proved successful this solution could be deployed relatively cheaply and quickly. Potential problems include environmental impacts e.g. from changing rainfall patterns.

Measures to cut carbon and methane emissions, such as carbon taxes, came bottom of the results list, partly because they would take a long time to have much effect on temperatures.

==Copenhagen Consensus 2004==

=== Process ===
Eight economists met May 24–28, 2004 at a roundtable in Copenhagen. A series of background papers had been prepared in advance to summarize the current knowledge about the welfare economics of 32 proposals (&quot;opportunities&quot;) from 10 categories (&quot;challenges&quot;). For each category, one assessment article and two critiques were produced. After a closed-door review of the background papers, each of the participants gave economic priority rankings to 17 of the proposals (the rest were deemed inconclusive).

=== Economists ===
* Jagdish Bhagwati
* Robert Fogel
* Bruno Frey
* Justin Yifu Lin
* Douglass North
* Thomas Schelling
* Vernon L. Smith
* Nancy Stokey

=== Challenges ===

Below is a list of the 10 challenge areas and the author of the paper on each. Within each challenge, 3–4 opportunities (proposals) were analyzed:

* Communicable diseases (Anne Mills)
* Conflicts (Paul Collier)
* Education (Lant Pritchett)
* Financial instability (Barry Eichengreen)
* Global Warming sometimes also called Climate change (William R. Cline)
* Government and corruption (Susan Rose-Ackerman)
* Malnutrition and hunger (Jere Behrman)
* Population: migration (Phillip L. Martin)
* Sanitation and water (Frank Rijsberman)
* Subsidies and trade barriers (Kym Anderson)

=== Results ===
The panel agreed to rate seventeen of the thirty-two opportunities within seven of the ten challenges. The rated opportunities were further classified into four groups: Very Good, Good, Fair and Bad; all results are based using cost–benefit analysis.

====Very good====
The highest priority was assigned to implementing certain new measures to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS. The economists estimated that an investment of $27 billion could avert nearly 30 million new infections by 2010.

Policies to reduce malnutrition and hunger were chosen as the second priority. Increasing the availability of micronutrients, particularly reducing iron deficiency anemia through dietary supplements, was judged to have an exceptionally high ratio of benefits to costs, which were estimated at $12 billion.
Third on the list was trade liberalization; the experts agreed that modest costs could yield large benefits for the world as a whole and for developing nations.

The fourth priority identified was controlling and treating malaria; $13 billion costs were judged to produce very good benefits, particularly if applied toward chemically-treated mosquito netting for beds.

====Good====
The fifth priority identified was increased spending on research into new agricultural technologies appropriate for developing nations. Three proposals for improving sanitation and water quality for a billion of the world’s poorest followed in priority (ranked sixth to eighth: small-scale water technology for livelihoods, community-managed water supply and sanitation, and research on water productivity in food production). Completing this group was the &#x27;government&#x27; project concerned with lowering the cost of starting new businesses.

====Fair====
Ranked tenth was the project on lowering barriers to migration for skilled workers. Eleventh and twelfth on the list were malnutrition projects – improving infant and child nutrition and reducing the prevalence of low birth weight. Ranked thirteenth was the plan for scaled-up basic health services to fight diseases.

====Poor====
Ranked fourteenth to seventeenth were: a migration project (guest-worker programmes for the unskilled), which was deemed to discourage integration; and three projects addressing climate change (optimal carbon tax, the Kyoto Protocol and value-at-risk carbon tax), which the panel judged to be least cost-efficient of the proposals.

=== Global warming ===

The panel found that all three climate policies presented have &quot;costs that were likely to exceed the benefits&quot;. It further stated &quot;global warming must be addressed, but agreed that approaches based on too abrupt a shift toward lower emissions of carbon are needlessly expensive.&quot;

In regard to the science of global warming, the paper presented by Cline relied primarily on the framework set by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and accepted the consensus view on global warming that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the primary cause of the global warming. Cline relies on various research studies published in the field of economics and attempted to compare the estimated cost of mitigation policies against the expected reduction in the damage of the global warming.

Cline used a discount rate of 1.5%. (Cline&#x27;s summary is on the project webpage ) He justified his choice of discount rate on the ground of &quot;utility-based discounting&quot;, that is there is zero bias in terms of preference between the present and the future generation (see time preference). Moreover, Cline extended the time frame of the analysis to three hundred years in the future. Because the expected net damage of the global warming becomes more apparent beyond the present generation(s), this choice had the effect of increasing the present-value cost of the damage of global warming as well as the benefit of abatement policies.

== Criticism ==

Members of the panel including Thomas Schelling and one of the two perspective paper writers Robert O. Mendelsohn (both opponents of the Kyoto protocol) criticised Cline, mainly on the issue of discount rates. (See &quot;The opponent notes to the paper on Climate Change&quot; ) Mendelsohn, in particular, characterizing Cline&#x27;s position, said that &quot;[i]f we use a large discount rate, they will be judged to be small effects&quot; and called it &quot;circular reasoning, not a justification&quot;. Cline responded to this by arguing that there is no obvious reason to use a large discount rate just because this is what is usually done in economic analysis. In other words, climate change ought to be treated differently from other, more imminent problems. The Economist quoted Mendelsohn as worrying that &quot;climate change was set up to fail&quot;.

Moreover, Mendelsohn argued that Cline&#x27;s damage estimates were excessive. Citing various recent articles, including some of his own, he stated that &quot;[a] series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits.&quot;

The 2004 Copenhagen Consensus attracted various criticisms:

===Approach and alleged bias===

The 2004 report, especially its conclusion regarding climate change, was subsequently criticised from a variety of perspectives. The general approach adopted to set priorities was criticised by Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist and advocate of both the Kyoto protocol and increased development aid, who argued that the analytical framework was inappropriate and biased and that the project &quot;failed to mobilize an expert group that could credibly identify and communicate a true consensus of expert knowledge on the range of issues under consideration.&quot;.

Tom Burke, a former director of Friends of the Earth, repudiated the entire approach of the project, arguing that applying cost–benefit analysis in the way the Copenhagen panel did was &quot;junk economics&quot;.

John Quiggin, an Australian economics professor, commented that the project is a mix of &quot;a substantial contribution to our understanding of important issues facing the world&quot; and an &quot;exercises in political propaganda&quot; and argued that the selection of the panel members was slanted towards the conclusions previously supported by Lomborg. Quiggin observed that Lomborg had argued in his controversial book &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; that resources allocated to mitigating global warming would be better spent on improving water quality and sanitation, and was therefore seen as having prejudged the issues.

Under the heading &quot;Wrong Question&quot;, Sachs further argued that: &quot;The panel that drew up the Copenhagen Consensus was asked to allocate an additional US$50 billion in spending by wealthy countries, distributed over five years, to address the world’s biggest problems. This was a poor basis for decision-making and for informing the public. By choosing such a low sum — a tiny fraction of global income — the project inherently favoured specific low-cost schemes over bolder, larger projects. It is therefore no surprise that the huge and complex challenge of long-term climate change was ranked last, and that scaling up health services in poor countries was ranked lower than interventions against specific diseases, despite warnings in the background papers that such interventions require broader improvements in health services.&quot;

In response Lomborg argued that $50 billion was &quot;an optimistic but realistic example of actual spending.&quot; &quot;Experience shows that pledges and actual spending are two different things. In 1970 the UN set itself the task of doubling development assistance. Since then the percentage has actually been dropping&quot;. &quot;But even if Sachs or others could gather much more than $50 billion over the next 4 years, the Copenhagen Consensus priority list would still show us where it should be invested first.&quot; 

Thomas Schelling, one of the Copenhagen Consensus panel experts, later distanced himself from the way in which the Consensus results have been interpreted in the wider debate, arguing that it was misleading to put climate change at the bottom of the priority list. The Consensus panel members were presented with a dramatic proposal for handling climate change. If given the opportunity, Schelling would have put a more modest proposal higher on the list. The Yale economist Robert O. Mendelsohn was the official critic of the proposal for climate change during the Consensus. He thought the proposal was way out of the mainstream and could only be rejected. Mendelsohn worries that climate change was set up to fail.

Michael Grubb, an economist and lead author for several IPCC reports, commented on the Copenhagen Consensus, writing:
To try and define climate policy as a trade-off against foreign aid is thus a forced choice that bears no relationship to reality. No government is proposing that the marginal costs associated with, for example, an emissions trading system, should be deducted from its foreign aid budget. This way of posing the question is both morally inappropriate and irrelevant to the determination of real climate mitigation policy.

===Panel membership===

Quiggin argued that the members of the 2004 panel, selected by Lomborg, were &quot;generally towards the right and, to the extent that they had stated views, to be opponents of Kyoto.&quot; Sachs also noted that the panel members had not previously been much involved in issues of development economics and were unlikely to reach useful conclusions in the time available to them. Commenting on the 2004 Copenhagen Consensus, climatologist and IPCC author Stephen Schneider criticised Lomborg for only inviting economists to participate:
In order to achieve a true consensus, I think Lomborg would&#x27;ve had to invite ecologists, social scientists concerned with justice and how climate change impacts and policies are often inequitably distributed, philosophers who could challenge the economic paradigm of &quot;one dollar, one vote&quot; implicit in cost–benefit analyses promoted by economists, and climate scientists who could easily show that Lomborg&#x27;s claim that climate change will have only minimal effects is not sound science.

Lomborg countered criticism of the panel membership by stating that &quot;Sachs disparaged the Consensus &#x27;dream team&#x27; because it only consisted of economists. But that was the very point of the project. Economists have expertise in economic prioritization. It is they and not climatologists or malaria experts who can prioritize between battling global warming or communicable disease&quot;.

<text>Susan Victoria Lucci (born December 23, 1946) is an American actress. She is best known for portraying Erica Kane on the ABC daytime drama &quot;All My Children&quot; during that show&#x27;s entire network run from 1970 to 2011. The character is considered an icon, and she was called &quot;Daytime&#x27;s Leading Lady&quot; by &quot;TV Guide&quot;, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; citing her as the highest-paid actor in daytime television. As early as 1991, her salary had been reported as over $1 million a year. During her run on &quot;All My Children&quot;, Lucci was nominated 21 times for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She won only once, in 1999, after the 19th nomination; her status as a perpetual nominee for the award had attracted significant media attention since the late 1980s.

Lucci has also acted in other TV series, as well as occasionally in film and on stage. She had multi-episode guest appearances on the series &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; and &quot;Army Wives&quot;. Lucci hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1990. After the cancellation of &quot;All My Children&quot;, she hosted the 2012-2014 true crime series &quot;Deadly Affairs&quot; and starred (as Genevieve Delatour) in the 2013–2016 Lifetime series &quot;Devious Maids&quot;.

In 1996, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked her number 37 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list. She was named one of VH1&#x27;s 200 Top Icons of All Time and one of Barbara Walters&#x27;s Ten Most Fascinating People.

==Early life==
Susan Lucci was born in Scarsdale, New York, to parents Jeanette (1917–2021) and Victor Lucci (1919–2002). Her father was of Italian ancestry, and her mother was of Swedish descent. She lived in Yonkers, New York, before moving with her family at age 2 to Elmont, New York, and then at age 5 to another Long Island town, Garden City, New York. Lucci graduated from Garden City High School in 1964 and from Marymount College, Tarrytown in 1968, with a BA degree in drama.

==Career==
Susan Lucci began her television career with bit parts on the daytime soap operas &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; and &quot;The Doctors&quot;. She also appeared in an uncredited role in the 1969 film &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; and had a minor role in the 1969 comedy-drama &quot;Me, Natalie&quot;.

===&quot;All My Children&quot;===
Lucci is best known for appearing as Erica Kane on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, from January 16, 1970, to September 23, 2011. Erica is considered to be the most popular character in American soap opera history. &quot;TV Guide&quot; calls her &quot;unequivocally the most famous soap opera character in the history of daytime TV,&quot; and included her in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.

Lucci was nominated for the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series Emmy for her work on &quot;All My Children&quot; almost every year beginning in 1978. When Lucci did not win the award after several consecutive nominations, her image in the media began to be lampooned, as she became notoriously synonymous with never winning an Emmy. NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; exploited this by asking her to host an episode; during her monologue, the show&#x27;s cast, crew, and even stagehands nonchalantly carried (and utilized; for example, as hammers and doorjambs) Emmys of their own in her presence. In addition, she appeared in a 1989 television commercial for the sugar substitute Sweet One, intended to portray her as the opposite of her villainess character, yet throwing one of Erica Kane&#x27;s characteristic tantrums, shouting, &quot;Eleven years without an Emmy! What does a person have to do around here to get an Emmy?&quot; Her name eventually became part of the language, used as an avatar for artists who receive numerous award nominations without a win (e.g., &quot;Peter O&#x27;Toole was the Susan Lucci of the Oscars.&quot;).

After 18 nominations, she finally won in 1999; Lucci received a standing ovation upon receiving the award, which was presented by Shemar Moore.

When ABC cancelled &quot;All My Children&quot; on April 14, 2011, after 41 years on the air, Lucci said in an interview: &quot;It&#x27;s been a fantastic journey. I&#x27;ve loved playing Erica Kane and working with Agnes Nixon and all the incredible people involved with &quot;All My Children&quot;. I&#x27;m looking forward to all kinds of new and exciting opportunities.&quot; Lucci publicly criticized ABC Daytime president Brian Frons over the cancellation of &quot;All My Children&quot; in the epilogue of her autobiography &quot;All My Life&quot;.

===Primetime television, stage, hosting and film===

Lucci has appeared in a number of television series and television movies. In 1982, she appeared in a cameo appearance in the comedy film &quot;Young Doctors in Love&quot;. During the 1980s, she made guest-starring appearances in prime time series, such as &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;. In 1984 she played her first leading role in the supernatural horror film &quot;Invitation to Hell&quot; directed by Wes Craven.

In 1986, Lucci played the role of Darya Romanoff in the Golden Globe– and Emmy Award–winning made-for-television movie &quot;&quot;. The same year she played the lead role as Antoinette Giancana, Salavatore &#x27;Sam&#x27; Giancana&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s in the crime made-for-television movie, &quot;Mafia Princess&quot;. The following year she starred in another horror film, &quot;Haunted by Her Past&quot;. She later starred in the crime dramas &quot;Lady Mobster&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Bride in Black&quot; (1990). In 1990–1991, she began a series of guest spots on the nighttime soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;. She hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in October of that year; in one skit, she appeared as Erica Kane competing on a game show. In 1991 she starred in the thriller &quot;The Woman Who Sinned&quot;. She later starred in &quot;Double Edge&quot; (1992), &quot;Between Love and Hate&quot; (1993), &quot;French Silk&quot; (1994) and &quot;Seduced and Betrayed&quot; (1995).

In 1995, Lucci played Elizabeth &#x27;Ebbie&#x27; Scrooge in the Lifetime Fantasy television film, &quot;Ebbie&quot;. This film was an updated version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Lucci played a Scrooge-like department store owner visited by Marley and the three ghosts on Christmas.Television critic Lynne Heffley from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave it a positive review writing: &quot;Soap queen Susan Lucci of “All My Children” is fun to watch as a severely tailored, unsmiling boss, spreading misery wherever she goes on Christmas Eve, whether firing a security guard or deciding the store’s traditional window display has got to go.&quot; In 1998 she returned to thrillers with &quot;Blood on Her Hands&quot;.

In 1999, she played the title role of Annie Oakley in the revival of Irving Berlin&#x27;s musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;. Michael Logan of TV Guide said, &quot;Susan Lucci didn&#x27;t just take Great White Way by storm: she took it by tornado, hurricane and tsunami, too.&quot; In 2004, she guest starred in two episodes of the ABC comedy series &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot; opposite Kelly Ripa. In 2005 she guest-starred on &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;.

Lucci competed in season 7 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with dance partner Tony Dovolani. She said that &quot;Dancing&quot; had asked her to appear before, but she had turned it down, in part, because of the travel it would have required of her (at the time &quot;Dancing&quot; taped in Los Angeles while &quot;All My Children&quot; taped in New York). Lucci later changed her mind, in part, because of the experience of fellow &quot;All My Children&quot; star Cameron Mathison, who finished fifth in season 5. She was voted off the show on November 5, 2008, rather than November 4 due to election night, finishing sixth in the competition.

===2012—present===
From 2010 to 2014, Lucci made several appearances as herself, the arch rival of Wendie Malick&#x27;s character, Victoria Chase, on the TV Land sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; , including the February 1, 2012 episode entitled &quot;Life with Lucci&quot;. She appeared in Gloria Estefan&#x27;s music video &quot;Hotel Nacional&quot; in February 2012. She guest starred in multi-episodes of the sixth season of Lifetime drama series, &quot;Army Wives&quot; in 2012. Lucci also hosted and narrated &quot;Deadly Affairs&quot;, a prime-time series airing on &quot;Investigation Discovery&quot; from 2012 to 2014. On November 15, 2012, Lucci appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in a segment reflecting the soap-opera-like nature of the Petraeus scandal.

In 2013, Lucci began starring as Geneviève Delatour in the Lifetime comedy-drama series, &quot;Devious Maids&quot; created by Marc Cherry. Her comedic performance was well-received by television critics. The series ended in 2016 after four seasons. In 2015 she appeared in the comedy-drama film, &quot;Joy&quot; directed by David O. Russell.

In 2017, Lucci played one of Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard&#x27;s grandparents (with Henry Winkler) in Sia&#x27;s music video, &quot;Santa&#x27;s Coming for Us&quot;. Also in 2017 she guest-starred in an episode of Hulu comedy series, &quot;Difficult People&quot;. She also appeared in television ads for Progressive Insurance that were styled as a soap opera.

In 2023, Lucci received Lifetime Achievement Award at the 50th Daytime Emmy Awards. In 2024, after seven years acting hiatus, Lucci returned to screen in the black comedy film, &quot;Outcome&quot; starring opposite Keanu Reeves, Jonah Hill and Cameron Diaz.

==Business ventures==
Lucci also has her own line of hair care products, perfumes, lingerie and skin care, called The Susan Lucci Collection.

==Personal life==
Lucci married Austrian-born chef and food-service manager Helmut Huber on September 13, 1969. They are the parents of two children: actress Liza Huber and a son, Andreas Huber. The couple were married 52 years until Helmut&#x27;s death on March 28, 2022; he was 84 years old.

Lucci&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;All My Life: A Memoir&quot;, was published in 2011. She is a registered Republican and has hosted fundraising events for Rudy Giuliani. She is a supporter of LGBT rights and equality, her support spurred by an &quot;All My Children&quot; storyline in 2000 in which her character Erica&#x27;s daughter, Bianca Montgomery, came out as a lesbian.

In late 2018, Lucci had an emergency procedure to place two arterial stents in her heart after blocked arteries were discovered due to chest pain. Lucci postponed making her experience public until shortly before the American Heart Association&#x27;s annual Go Red for Women fashion event in February 2019.

She attended Berridge Road School (Hyson Green) and Peveril Bilateral School, Robin&#x27;s Wood Road (now Nottingham Girls&#x27; Academy). 

After leaving school at the age of 16, she got a job at the Tennant Rubber Company in Carlton as a shorthand typist and began singing in working men&#x27;s clubs and charity shows.

==Career==

Following an apprenticeship at the Arts Theatre in Nottingham, Pollard appeared on &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; in 1974, singing &quot;I Cain&#x27;t Say No&quot; from &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, and came second to a singing Jack Russell.

Paul Nicholas played her partner, Jimmy, both of whom were squatting in the house of a nice middle-class couple. It only lasted for one series, but then later that year came the pilot programme for a new BBC comedy written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft set in a holiday camp. Pollard landed the role of chalet maid Peggy Ollerenshaw in &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; She continued in this role until the programme&#x27;s end in 1988. During the run of &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; Pollard also had a singing career, and in 1986, she reached No. 2 in the UK singles chart with the song &quot;Starting Together&quot;, the theme song from the BBC Television &#x27;fly-on-the-wall&#x27; documentary series &quot;The Marriage&quot;.

<text>Bartholemew William Barclay &quot;Bat&quot; Masterson (November 26, 1853 – October 25, 1921) was a U.S. Army scout, lawman, professional gambler, and journalist known for his exploits in the late 19th and early 20th-century American Old West. He was born to a working-class Irish family in Quebec, but he moved to the Western frontier as a young man and quickly distinguished himself as a buffalo hunter, civilian scout, and Indian fighter on the Great Plains. He later earned fame as a gunfighter and sheriff in Dodge City, Kansas, during which time he was involved in several notable shootouts.

By the mid-1880s, Masterson had moved to Denver, Colorado and established himself as a &quot;sporting man&quot; or gambler. He took an interest in prizefighting and became a leading authority on the sport, attending almost every important match and title fight in the United States from the 1880s until his death in 1921. He moved to New York City in 1902 and spent the rest of his life there as a reporter and columnist for &quot;The Morning Telegraph&quot;. His column covered boxing and other sports, and it frequently gave his opinions on crime, war, politics, and other topics, as well. He became a close friend of President Theodore Roosevelt and was one of the &quot;White House Gunfighters&quot; who received federal appointments from Roosevelt, along with Pat Garrett and Ben Daniels.

By the time of his death in 1921, Masterson was known throughout the country as a leading sports writer and celebrity. He is remembered today for his connection to many of the Wild West&#x27;s most iconic people, places, and events, and his life and likeness are frequently depicted in American popular culture.

==Early life==
Masterson was born on November 26, 1853, at Henryville, Quebec, in the Eastern Townships of what was then known as Canada East. He was baptized under the name Bartholomew Masterson.
Masterson was the second child of Thomas Masterson (or Mastersan), who was born in Canada to an Irish family, and Catherine McGurk (or McGureth), who was born in Ireland. The other six Masterson children were Edward John (1852–1878), James Patrick (1855–1895), Nellie E. (1857–1925), Thomas (1858–1941), George Henry (1860–1889), and Emma Anna &quot;Minnie&quot; (1862–1884). The children were raised on farms in Quebec, New York, Illinois, and Missouri until the family finally settled near Wichita, Kansas.

==Move to the frontier==
In his late teens, Masterson and his brothers Ed and Jim left their family&#x27;s farm to hunt buffalo on the Great Plains. In July 1872, Ed and Bat Masterson were hired by a subcontractor named Raymond Ritter to grade a five-mile section of track for the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad. Ritter skipped out without paying the Masterson brothers all of the wages to which they were entitled.

It took Masterson nearly a year, but he finally collected his overdue wages from Ritter, at gunpoint. On April 15, 1873, Masterson learned that Ritter was due to arrive in Dodge City, Kansas, aboard a Santa Fe train and that Ritter was carrying a large roll of cash. When Ritter&#x27;s train pulled in, Masterson entered the car alone and confronted him and marched him out onto the rear platform of the train, where he forced him to hand over the $300 owed to him, his brother Ed, and a friend named Theodore Raymond. A loud cheer then went up from a large crowd which had witnessed the event.

===Battle of Adobe Walls===

Masterson was once again engaged in buffalo hunting on June 27, 1874, when he became an involuntary participant in one of the Wild West&#x27;s most celebrated Indian fights: a five-day siege by several hundred Comanche, Kiowa and Cheyenne warriors led by Quanah Parker at a collection of ramshackle buildings in the Texas panhandle known as Adobe Walls. Masterson was one of only 28 hunters who defended the outpost during the attack. The Comanche suffered the most losses during the battle, though the actual number killed is not known, with reports ranging from a low of 30 to a high of 70. The defenders of Adobe Walls lost only four men, one of whom shot himself by accident. After being fought to a standstill, Quanah Parker and his followers rode off.

In August 1874, Masterson signed on as a U.S. Army scout with Colonel Nelson Miles, who was leading a force from Fort Dodge to pursue Comanche and Apache war parties across the Cherokee Strip and into Texas. The force was eventually engaged to recover four sisters—ranging in age from 9 to 15—who had been captured by a group of Cheyenne Dog Soldiers. The sisters were part of a family that had been attacked outside of Ellis, Kansas, on September 11, 1874, while migrating to Colorado Territory. Their parents, brother, and two older sisters had been killed and scalped. All four sisters were recovered alive by Miles&#x27; force over a period of about six months.

==Gunfighter and lawman==

Masterson&#x27;s first gunfight took place on January 24, 1876, in Sweetwater, Texas (later Mobeetie in Wheeler County). He was attacked by a soldier, Corporal Melvin A. King (real name Anthony Cook) allegedly because he was with a woman named Mollie Brennan. Brennan was hit by one of King&#x27;s bullets, possibly by accident, and was killed. King died of his wounds. Masterson was shot in the pelvis but recovered. This is the reason why he used a cane. The cane would become one of his famous trademarks.

===Dodge City===
Masterson soon settled in Dodge City. On June 6, 1877, Masterson tried to prevent the arrest of Robert Gilmore, who was known to the locals as &quot;Bobby Gill.&quot; Masterson managed to wrap his arms about the girth of the 315 pound city marshal, Lawrence Edward &quot;Larry&quot; Deger, thereby permitting Gill to escape. Masterson was grabbed by friends of Deger and pistol-whipped by the lawman. The following day, Masterson was fined $25 for disturbing the peace. Bobby Gill, the cause of Masterson&#x27;s fine, was assessed only $5.

During July 1877, Masterson was hired to serve as under-sheriff to Sheriff Charles E. Bassett. Bassett was prohibited by the Kansas State Constitution from seeking a third consecutive term. With the job up for grabs, Masterson decided to run for the office. Masterson&#x27;s opponent turned out to be Larry Deger. On November 6, 1877, Masterson was elected county sheriff of Ford County, Kansas, by the narrow margin of three votes. Within a month of Masterson&#x27;s election, on December 6, 1877, Ed Masterson replaced Larry Deger as city marshal of Dodge, so together the Masterson brothers controlled the city and county police forces.
On February 1, 1878, Sheriff Masterson captured the notorious outlaws Dave Rudabaugh and Ed West, who were wanted for an attempted train robbery. Two more of the train robbers were caught by Bat and brother Ed on March 15. The tandem law enforcement effort came to an abrupt end, however, when 25-year-old City Marshal Ed Masterson was shot and killed in the line of duty on April 9, 1878. Ed Masterson was mortally wounded by a cowboy named Jack Wagner, who was unaware that Bat Masterson was in the vicinity. As Ed stumbled away from the scene, Bat Masterson responded from across the street, firing on both Wagner and Wagner&#x27;s boss, Alf Walker—who was holding a gun. Wagner died the next day, but Walker was taken back to Texas and recovered. The local newspapers were ambiguous about who shot Wagner and Walker, and this led some later historians to question whether Bat Masterson was involved. However, the rediscovery of two court cases in which Bat Masterson testified under oath that he had shot both men adds credence to the idea that Bat had avenged his brother.

More violence followed on October 4, 1878, when a variety actress named Dora Hand, known professionally as &quot;Fannie Keenan,&quot; was shot and killed by James Kenedy, son of the wealthy Texas cattleman, Mifflin Kenedy. Masterson&#x27;s posse, which included Wyatt Earp and Bill Tilghman, captured Kenedy the following day after Masterson shot him in the left arm, and other posse members killed his horse.

===Royal Gorge Railroad War===
Santa Fe Railroad officials had wired Sheriff Bat Masterson asking him to recruit men to battle the forces of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad, which were contesting the right-of-way through the Royal Gorge near Pueblo, Colorado. As a sheriff in Kansas, Masterson had no authority in Colorado, but this did not prevent him from enlisting a large company of men. Among Masterson&#x27;s recruits were such noted gunmen as Ben Thompson, &quot;Mysterious Dave&quot; Mather, John Joshua Webb, and possibly Doc Holliday. The end of Masterson&#x27;s involvement came on June 12, 1879, when he surrendered a roundhouse his men were holding at Cañon City, Colorado. The &quot;war&quot; between the railroads was finally settled out of court. Masterson&#x27;s Colorado activities did not go over well with the voters of Ford County, Kansas. On November 4, 1879, a bartender named George T. Hinkel defeated Masterson in his re-election bid for sheriff by a vote of 404 to 268.

===Billy Thompson and Buffalo Bill Cody===
The 1880 Dodge City census shows that, at that time, Masterson was living with Annie Ladue, age 19 (described as his &quot;concubine&quot;). City Marshal James Masterson, Bat&#x27;s younger brother, was listed on the same census as living with Minnie Roberts, age 16. Not long after this census was taken, Bat Masterson received a telegram from Ben Thompson asking Bat to save Ben&#x27;s troublesome brother, Billy Thompson, from almost certain lynching in Ogallala, Nebraska. Billy Thompson had shot the thumb off a man named Tucker, who, despite missing a digit, managed to fire back and seriously wound Billy. Masterson took Billy Thompson out of Ogallala by a midnight train bound for North Platte, Nebraska. In North Platte, Masterson was provided with assistance by William F. &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody, who promptly offered to help. According to Masterson, he and Billy Thompson &quot;were given a royal welcome and were immediately taken in charge by Colonel Cody, who found a safe place for us to remain until he could outfit us for the trip across the country to Dodge City.&quot; This episode was reported in the &quot;Dodge City Times&quot;, which noted that &quot;W.B. Masterson arrived from a visit to Ogallala, this week. He says Nebraska is dry and many people are leaving the state. He came by wagon, and was accompanied by &#x27;Texas Billy&#x27; Thompson. The latter has recovered from his wounds.&quot;

===Battle of the plaza===

Masterson spent the remainder of 1880 in Kansas City and Dodge. On February 8, 1881, he left Dodge City and joined Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, where he met Luke Short for the first time. Earp, Short, and Masterson worked as faro dealers, or &quot;look outs&quot;, at Tombstone&#x27;s Oriental Saloon. Masterson had only been in Tombstone for two months when he received an urgent telegram that compelled him to return to Dodge City. His brother Jim had a partnership with Alfred James &quot;A.J.&quot; Peacock in Dodge City&#x27;s Lady Gay Saloon and Dance Hall. Albert &quot;Al&quot; Updegraff was Peacock&#x27;s brother-in-law and bartender. Updegraff was a drunk, and Jim thought him dishonest. Jim had demanded that Peacock fire Updegraff, but Peacock refused. Their disagreement grew until threats were made, prompting the telegram.

Masterson arrived in Dodge City on April 16, 1881, where he accosted Updegraff and Peacock. Recognizing Masterson, Updegraff and Peacock retreated behind the jail and exchanged gunfire with him. Who had fired first is not clear. Citizens ran for cover as bullets ripped through the Long Branch Saloon. Other individuals began firing in support of both sides until Updegraff was wounded. Mayor A.B. Webster arrested Masterson. Afterward, Masterson learned that his brother Jim was not in danger. Updegraff recovered from his wounds, but the shooter who hit him could not be identified, so Masterson was fined $8.00 (equal to $ today) and released. Citizens were outraged and warrants were issued, but Bat and Jim Masterson were permitted to leave Dodge City.

Bat Masterson became more widely known as a gunfighter as a result of a practical joke played on a gullible newspaper reporter in August 1881. Seeking copy in Gunnison, Colorado, the reporter asked Dr. W.S. Cockrell about man-killers. Dr. Cockrell pointed to a young man nearby and said it was Masterson and that he had killed 26 men. Cockrell then regaled the reporter with the story of Ed Masterson&#x27;s death and how Bat responded fearlessly and heroically against his brother&#x27;s killers. The story was published in The New York Sun newspaper in New York (November 7, 1881) and was also widely reprinted in papers all over the country. Cockrell subsequently apologized to Masterson, who insisted he was not in Gunnison at the time. Allegedly, long after he retired from being a law officer Masterson would buy old .45 six-guns and &quot;sell&quot; them to gullible persons as &quot;relics&quot; of his Gunfighting days. Ironically, Masterson did own several .45 guns during his lifetime. although (excepting fighting Indians as a Buffalo Hunter and Army scout) Masterson was only involved in four incidents in which 2 men were killed and 2 wounded.

===City marshal of Trinidad, Colorado===
Masterson was appointed city marshal of Trinidad, Colorado, on April 17, 1882. He had hardly settled into his $75-a-month (equal to $ today) marshal&#x27;s job when Wyatt Earp requested his help to prevent the extradition of Doc Holliday from Colorado to Arizona. Masterson took his case directly to Colorado Governor Frederick W. Pitkin, who listened to Masterson&#x27;s appeal and finally refused to grant Holliday&#x27;s extradition. However, Masterson&#x27;s rescue of Doc Holliday, as well as his nightly &quot;moonlighting&quot; as a faro dealer, spelled doom for his career as city marshal of Trinidad. On March 28, 1883, a local paper noted: &quot;There are now two &#x27;bankers&#x27; running for city offices—Mr. Taylor of the Las Animas County Bank, and Mr. Masterson of the bank of &#x27;Fair O.&#x27; Both have a large number of depositors—one of time depositors and the other receives his deposits for keeps.&quot; On April 3, 1883, Masterson was defeated by a lopsided vote of 637 to 248.

===Dodge City War===
Masterson&#x27;s term as city marshal of Trinidad ended just in time for him to come to the aid of his friend, Luke Short, who had been run out of Dodge City by the mayor and Masterson&#x27;s long-time enemy, Larry Deger. Within weeks, a group of gunfighters recruited by Masterson and Earp descended upon Dodge City to resolve what became known as the &quot;Dodge City War.&quot; The result of this gathering reinstated Luke Short in Dodge. Before disbanding on June 10, 1883, Short, Masterson, Earp, and five other notable men from frontier history posed for a group portrait that was soon labeled &quot;The Dodge City Peace Commission.&quot; The photo became an iconic image of the Old West.

===First attempt at journalism===
Masterson was back in Dodge City on November 1, 1884, where he issued a small newspaper called &quot;Vox Populi&quot; which was devoted to local political issues. Three days after its appearance, he received a flattering—and prophetic—review of his journalistic effort from another Dodge City paper which observed: &quot;We are in receipt of the first number of &quot;Vox Populi&quot;, W.B. Masterson, editor, which in appearance is very neat and tidy. The news and statements it contains seem to be of a somewhat personal nature. The editor is very promising; if he survives the first week of his literary venture, there is no telling what he may accomplish in the journalistic field.&quot; Editor Masterson did not survive his first week. &quot;Vox Populi&quot; folded after printing just one issue and almost another 20 years would pass before he made journalism a full-time profession in New York City.

==Denver==
Masterson finally left Dodge City and made Denver, Colorado, his center of interest, where he soon became involved in a divorce scandal. The trouble began in a Denver theater on September 18, 1886, when a comedian named Lou Spencer, who was performing on stage, spotted his wife, Nellie, seated in the audience on Masterson&#x27;s knee. Spencer cut short his routine and confronted Masterson, who hit Spencer across the face with his pistol. Nellie Spencer watched from the wings while the two men slugged it out. Finally, they were arrested, fined, and released a short time later. In its account of the incident, the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; described Masterson as one &quot;who pleases the ladies&quot;, and Nellie McMahon Spencer as &quot;a beautiful woman, with a fine wardrobe and a sweet voice.&quot; Three days later, Nellie filed for divorce and the Denver papers were quick to report that Nellie had &quot;eloped&quot; with Masterson. No record has been found of the two ever getting married, and she soon disappeared from Masterson&#x27;s life.

Masterson dealt faro for &quot;Big Ed&quot; Chase at the Arcade gambling house. In 1888, he managed and then purchased the Palace Variety Theater. There, Masterson probably first met an Indian club swinger and singer, Emma Moulton. The pair subsequently lived together and they were widely reported to have married in Denver on November 21, 1891. The only known source for that date was given by Masterson&#x27;s brother, Thomas Masterson, years after Bat had died. Emma was not divorced from her first husband, Edwin Winford Moulton, until November 9, 1893. When they were later enumerated in the 1910 U.S. Census, Bat and Emma claimed that they had been married for 17 years, suggesting a marriage date of 1893. Masterson&#x27;s biographer has raised the possibility that they were married on November 21, 1893, two weeks after Emma&#x27;s divorce from Edwin Moulton. The two were traveling through the eastern states at that time, but an actual marriage record has not been found.

It was in Denver that Masterson met and began a long-term friendship with the infamous confidence man and crime boss Soapy Smith. In 1889, the two were involved in election scandal involving fraudulent registration ballot casting.

===Prizefighting===
Masterson maintained an interest in prizefighting and other sports, and was known as a frequent attendee at boxing matches across the country. He frequently placed bets on the fights and occasionally served in an official capacity as a second or a timekeeper. He knew—and was known by—the heavyweight champions of the era, from John L. Sullivan and James J. &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; Corbett to Jack Johnson and Jack Dempsey. The sports-minded Masterson was ringside during the John L. Sullivan—Jake Kilrain heavyweight championship fight at Richburg, Mississippi, on July 8, 1889. He was the designated timekeeper for Kilrain and came under fire from some sources for how he handled his role. Reportedly, Masterson saw to it that Luke Short, Johnny Murphy, and &quot;twelve other good men were scattered around the ring where they would do the most good in case of an emergency.&quot;

In early 1892 Masterson moved to the silver boom-town of Creede, Colorado where he managed the Denver Exchange gambling club until the town was destroyed by fire on June 5, 1892. On September 7, 1892, Masterson, Short, and Charlie Bassett attended the Sullivan–Corbett championship fight in New Orleans. According to a Dodge City paper, Masterson bet on the winner, Corbett, while noting, &quot;Charlie Bassett and Luke Short were among the notables in attendance. Bassett bet his money on Sullivan.&quot; Masterson was in Jacksonville, Florida, on January 25, 1894, acting as a second for Charlie Mitchell during Mitchell&#x27;s heavyweight title shot at the champion, James J. &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; Corbett. Mitchell was knocked cold in three rounds.

===Last years in Denver===
Masterson moved to New York City in 1895 to briefly serve as a bodyguard for millionaire George Gould. He wrote to his Denver friends glowing accounts of fishing trips &quot;...with the Goulds on their yacht...&quot; and announced his intention to remain in New York City indefinitely. On June 6, 1895, a Denver paper quoted a friend of Masterson&#x27;s, who observed that &quot;Bat has at last fallen into a dead easy game.&quot;

Masterson returned to Denver for several more years. On April 6, 1897, serving as a deputy sheriff of Arapahoe County, he got into a dispute on election day with a Tim Connors. Masterson drew his pistol and Connors attempted to seize it. During the scuffle, the gun discharged and C.C. Louderbaugh was shot in the left wrist.

On April 9, 1899, Masterson became a partner in a boxing club called the Colorado Athletic Association. Within a few days, Masterson was excluded from the organization by his partners. Masterson retaliated on April 18 by founding a rival club, the Olympic, with himself as president. Masterson received favorable media coverage from a Denver newspaper called &quot;George&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, where he was employed as sports editor.

In September 1900, Masterson sold his interest in the Olympic Athletic Club and made another visit to New York City. Masterson had decided to settle in New York City, but had a sudden change of heart and returned to Denver, with humiliating results. Two conflicting versions are given for what caused his final departure from Denver. Masterson&#x27;s story was that an irate woman belted him with an umbrella on May 2, 1902, when she took exception to an &quot;undesirable&quot; such as Masterson trying to cast his ballot at a local election. An alternative version states that Masterson had become a dangerous drunk who was run out of Denver for being a public nuisance. Whatever actually happened, Masterson left Denver and never returned.

==New York==

===Journalism career===
Masterson and Emma moved to New York City on June 5, 1902. The next day, Masterson was having his shoes shined at a public stand when police swooped in and arrested a West Coast gambler named James A. Sullivan, who was standing nearby. They took Masterson, too, alleging he was part of a bunco scheme to fleece a Mormon elder named George H. Snow out of $16,000. Masterson also had a concealed revolver. The bunco charge was dismissed. Masterson paid a $10 fine for the concealed weapon. About his arrest, Masterson complained to a reporter, &quot;This fellow Gargan who arrested me is a warm baby—in his mind. He thinks all people are suckers. That&#x27;s the trouble with these mush-headed coppers. Give them a political job to keep from starving and they think they own the earth.&quot;

A friend, journalist, Alfred Henry Lewis, persuaded his brother, William Lewis, to provide Masterson with employment as a columnist for William&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;New York Morning Telegraph&quot;. His column, &quot;Masterson&#x27;s Views on Timely Topics,&quot; concerned sports in general and boxing in particular. The column appeared thrice weekly from 1903 until his death in 1921. In 1905, Alfred Henry Lewis published &quot;The Sunset Trail&quot;, a fictionalized biography of Masterson.
Lewis encouraged Masterson to write a series of sketches about his adventures, which were published by Lewis in &quot;Human Life&quot; magazine. In 1907, Masterson provided five biographical studies of Ben Thompson, Wyatt Earp, Luke Short, Doc Holliday and Bill Tilghman.

Masterson explained to his audience what he felt were the best properties of a gunfighter. Other articles were supposed to be in Masterson&#x27;s&quot; Human Life&quot; series, which had appeared under the title of &quot;Famous Gun Fighters of the Western Frontier&quot;, but the next three issues of &quot;Human Life&quot; came and went without a Masterson article. In the November 1907 issue, editor Alfred Henry Lewis assured the readers that Masterson would resume the series by explaining that Masterson&#x27;s reasons for &quot;breaking off the output&quot; were &quot;wholly of an idle, indolent, midsummer sort, which the managers of this magazine hope to overthrow so soon as a cooler temperature comes to the assistance of their arguments.&quot; Lewis offered this apology as part of his own article called &quot;The King of the Gun-Players: William Barclay Masterson.&quot; Lewis met with only limited success. Masterson provided only one more article, on Buffalo Bill Cody, which was his final &quot;Human Life&quot; contribution.

Concurrent to his career as a newspaper writer, Masterson served as the timekeeper for many prize fights, most notably for the Jack Johnson—Jess Willard title fight in Havana, Cuba, on April 5, 1915. A newsreel featuring the then 61-year-old Masterson&#x27;s introduction in that role was included in a documentary called &quot;Legendary Champions 1882–1929&quot;.

===Presidential appointment===
Alfred Henry Lewis introduced Masterson to President Theodore Roosevelt, and the two formed a friendship that resulted in Masterson being a frequent White House guest and also included regular correspondence. President Roosevelt arranged for Masterson&#x27;s appointment as deputy U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of New York. On February 2, 1905, Roosevelt wrote Masterson a letter which concluded with the lines: &quot;You must be careful not to gamble or do anything while you are a public officer which might afford opportunity to your enemies and my critics to say that your appointment was improper. I wish you to show this letter to Alfred Henry Lewis and go over the matter with him.&quot; Masterson served in the position, earning $2,000 per year (equal to $ today), until 1909. Theodore Roosevelt did not seek a third term in 1908, and his successor, William Howard Taft, did not share Roosevelt&#x27;s enthusiasm for Masterson. President Taft had his attorney general conduct an investigation of Masterson&#x27;s employment as a deputy U.S. Marshal, which resulted in Masterson being terminated on August 1, 1909. For the remaining 12 years of his life, Masterson covered the major boxing events of that era for the &quot;New York Morning Telegraph&quot;.

On April 5, 1915, the 61-year-old Masterson was in Havana, Cuba, attending the heavyweight championship fight between Jack Johnson and Jess Willard. As he arrived, he posed for a newsreel cameraman. In the brief film clip, he doffs his hat, smiles for the camera, and dons his hat. Later that day, in the official film of the fight, Masterson can be seen as one of the seconds for Jess Willard, climbing through the ropes just prior to the fight.

==Final days==
On July 2, 1921, Masterson attended his last heavyweight championship fight, the so-called &quot;Million Dollar Gate&quot;, promoted by George &quot;Tex&quot; Rickard, in which Jack Dempsey defended (and retained) his title of heavyweight champion of the world. Three months later, on October 7, silent-screen cowboy star William S. Hart visited Masterson. They were photographed standing together on the roof of the &quot;New York Morning Telegraph&quot; building and went back to Masterson&#x27;s office where he asked Hart to sit in his chair and pose for a second photo with him. According to Hart: &quot;I did so, and he stood beside me. Mr. Masterson was sitting in that same chair eighteen days later when he heard the last call.&quot; Hart subsequently cast a lookalike as Masterson in his biographical film &quot;Wild Bill Hickok&quot;, which was released in 1923.

===Death and burial===

On October 25, 1921, at age 67, Masterson died at his desk from a massive heart attack after writing what became his final column for the &quot;Morning Telegraph&quot;.

His last column included this statement &quot;I suppose these ginks who argue that ... because the rich man gets ice in the summer and the poor man gets it in the winter, things are breaking even for both. Maybe so, but I&#x27;ll swear I can&#x27;t see it that way.&quot;

About 500 people attended Masterson&#x27;s service at Frank E. Campbell&#x27;s Funeral Church at Broadway and 66th Street. Masterson&#x27;s honorary pallbearers included Damon Runyon, Tex Rickard, and William Lewis. Runyon was a close friend of Masterson&#x27;s and offered this memorable eulogy: &quot;He was a 100 percent, 22-karat real man. Bat was a good hater and a wonderful friend. He was always stretching out his hand to some down-and-outer. He had a great sense of humor and a marvelous fund of reminiscence, and was one of the most entertaining companions we have ever known. There are only too few men in the world like Bat Masterson and his death is a genuine loss.&quot;

Masterson was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. His first name, Bartholemew, does not appear on his gravestone, which is inscribed &quot;William Barclay Masterson&quot; (see photo), appears above his epitaph on the large granite grave marker. Masterson&#x27;s epitaph states that he was &quot;Loved by Everyone&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Masterson&#x27;s life has been portrayed in countless works of fiction and non-fiction in film, television, literature, and other popular media.

===Novels and comic books===

These stories later formed the basis for the classic 1950 musical comedy of the same name. The central character in Runyon&#x27;s &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; was a high-rolling gambler from Colorado whom Runyon barely disguised under the name of Sky Masterson.

Randisi describes a time in which fictional character Clint Adams comes to the aid of his friend Bat Masterson, who has been wrongly accused of murder and is being pursued by the &quot;victim&#x27;s&quot; brother. Many references are made to Masterson as one of Adams&#x27; closest friends throughout the series.
* The 2015 novel &quot;And the Wind Whispered&quot; by Dan Jorgensen features Bat Masterson as one of the key characters in a book set in 1894 Hot Springs, South Dakota.

<text>Agnes Nixon ( Eckhardt; December 10, 1922 – September 28, 2016) was an American television writer and producer, and the creator of the ABC soap operas &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, &quot;All My Children&quot;, as well as &quot;Loving&quot; and its spin-off &quot;The City.

Nixon&#x27;s work as producer and writer expanded storylines for American daytime television – the first health-related storyline, the first storyline related to the Vietnam War, as well as both the first televised lesbian kiss and abortion. She won five Writers&#x27; Guild of America Awards, five Daytime Emmy Awards, and in 2010, received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Nixon was often referred to as the &quot;Queen of The Modern American Soap Opera&quot;.

==Career==
===Early years===
Nixon was born Agnes Eckhardt on December 10, 1922, in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Agnes Patricia (née Dalton) and Harry Joseph Eckhardt. She attended Northwestern University, where she was a member of Alpha Chi Omega sorority. She began her career in soaps working for Irna Phillips. Under her tutelage, Nixon was a writer on &quot;Woman in White&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, and was head writer for &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, and &quot;Another World.&quot;

During her time on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, Nixon is believed to have written the first health-related storyline on a daytime soap opera. A friend of Nixon&#x27;s had died from cervical cancer, and Nixon wanted to do something to educate women about getting a pap smear. She wrote it into &quot;Guiding Light&quot; by having the lead character, Bert Bauer, experience a cancer scare. The storyline aired in 1962. In 2002, she was the inaugural recipient of the Pioneer for Health Award from Sentinel for Health for her work on the episode.

===&quot;One Life to Live&quot;===
By the mid-1960s, Nixon had created a blueprint for what would become &quot;All My Children&quot;. CBS executives passed on the program, due to contractual issues with sponsor Lever Brothers, who sponsored a program that &quot;All My Children&quot; would replace in its time slot. Later ABC asked her to create a show that would reflect a more &quot;contemporary&quot; tone; that creation was &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Nixon, &quot;tired of the restraints imposed by the WASPy, non-controversial nature of daytime drama&quot;, presented the network with a startlingly original premise and cast of characters. Although the show was built along the classic soap formula of a rich family (the Lords) and a poor family (the Woleks), &quot;One Life to Live&quot; emphasized the ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the people of Llanview, Pennsylvania, a fictional Main Line suburb of Philadelphia.&quot;

Premiering in 1968, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; reflected changing social structures and attitudes. The first few years of the show were rich in issue stories and characters including a Jewish character (Dave Siegel), an Irish American family (the Rileys), and some of the first African American leading roles in soap operas with Sadie Gray (Lillian Hayman), Carla Gray (Ellen Holly) and Ed Hall (Al Freeman Jr.). Carla&#x27;s story, for example, had her develop from a character who was passing as white to one who embodied black pride, with white and black lovers along the way, to antagonize racists. &quot;One Life to Live&quot; has been called &quot;the most peculiarly American of soap operas: the first serial to present a vast array of ethnic types, broad comic situations, a constant emphasis on social issues, and strong male characters.&quot;

===&quot;All My Children&quot;===
With the success of &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, Nixon was given the greenlight for &quot;All My Children&quot;, which began as a half-hour soap opera in 1970. The show was successful from its beginning, combining its study of social clashes with acting talent including Ruth Warrick (Phoebe Tyler) and Rosemary Prinz (Amy Tyler). Nixon helmed the writing team for over a decade, until 1983, and again introduced many social issues into storylines, including the Vietnam War, the anti-war movement, homosexuality, the AIDS epidemic, and American television&#x27;s first onscreen abortion.

&quot;All My Children&quot; was a half-hour show for the first seven years of its run, and virtually no recordings of those episodes survive; ABC erased the videotapes of those early episodes for their reuse. When ABC went to Nixon and said that they wanted her to expand the show to an hour in 1975, she resisted due to her own creative/quality concerns but later agreed under the condition that the tapes of the show would be archived and preserved by the network. Episodes began to be saved in 1976, and &quot;All My Children&quot; expanded to an hour on April 25, 1977.

In 1992, ABC executives decided that &quot;All My Children&quot; needed new blood and promoted a Nixon protégé, Megan McTavish, to the position of head writer. Nixon continued to be involved with the show, but wanted to take a step back from the grueling day-to-day task of being a head writer. McTavish made some important changes by re-writing major storylines and was dismissed in early 1995. Lorraine Broderick returned as head writer, working alongside Nixon to return the show to its socially relevant, character-driven roots. Broderick and Nixon went on to accept three consecutive Daytime Emmy awards for Outstanding Writing Team. Still, in late 1997, ABC abruptly decided to bring back McTavish. This move led to Nixon&#x27;s electing to step back from her story consulting role.

In early 1999, McTavish was dismissed for the second time and Nixon was again asked to take over the headwriting reins at &quot;All My Children&quot;. Nixon again wove social issues into the show, by having a major character &quot;come out&quot;. In 2000, Erica&#x27;s daughter, Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel), returned to Pine Valley and came out as a lesbian to her mother and to all of Pine Valley. This storyline led to &quot;All My Children&quot;″s winning a casting Artios award, a GLAAD Media Award, and a nomination for a Daytime Emmy for Best Drama Series.

=== &quot;Loving/The City&quot; ===
In 1983, Nixon began another series called &quot;Loving&quot;, which she co-created with Douglas Marland. The half-hour program debuted on ABC in June of that year and was set in the fictional town of Corinth, Pennsylvania. &quot;Loving&quot; struggled to gain a foothold in a crowded daytime schedule and ended its run in 1995. Nixon was given co-creator credit for &quot;Loving&#x27;s&quot; continuation series, &quot;The City.&quot; The show was cancelled in 1997 due to low ratings.

===On-screen appearances===
Nixon appeared in her shows on a number of occasions. In both &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; she played the character Agnes Eckhardt. She also played the characters Aggie on &quot;All My Children&quot; and Agnes Dixon on &quot;One Life to Live.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
She was married to Robert Henry Adolphus Nixon from April 6, 1951, until his death in 1996, and had four children. Nixon died in Haverford, Pennsylvania, on September 28, 2016, at age 93. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the cause of death to be &quot;pneumonia resulting from Parkinson&#x27;s disease&quot;.

Nixon&#x27;s memoirs, published in 2017, was titled &quot;My Life to Live: How I Became the Queen of Soaps When Men ruled the Airwaves&quot; ().

<doc id="645203" wikidata="Q7272681" url="?curid=645203" title="Quiver diagram">
<text>In theoretical physics, a quiver diagram is a graph representing the matter content of a gauge theory that describes D-branes on orbifolds. Quiver diagrams may also be used to described formula_1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions.

Each node of the graph corresponds to a factor &quot;U&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) of the gauge group, and each link represents a field in the bifundamental representation

:formula_2.

The relevance of quiver diagrams for string theory was pointed out and studied by Michael Douglas and Greg Moore.

While string theorists use the words &quot;quiver diagram&quot;, many of their colleagues in particle physics call these diagrams &quot;mooses&quot;.

==Definition==
For convenience, consider the supersymmetric formula_3 gauge theory in four-dimensional spacetime.

The quiver gauge theory is given by the following data:
* Finite quiver formula_4
* Each vertex formula_5 corresponds to a compact Lie group formula_6. This can be the unitary group formula_7, the special unitary group formula_8, special orthogonal group formula_9 or symplectic group formula_10.
* The gauge group is the product formula_11.
* Each edge of Q formula_12 corresponds to the defining representation formula_13. There is a corresponding superfield formula_14.

This representation is called a bifundamental representation. For example, if formula_15 and formula_16 corresponds to formula_17 and formula_18 then the edge corresponds to a six-dimensional representation formula_19

In this case, the quiver gauge theory is a four-dimensional formula_3 supersymmetric gauge theory. The quiver gauge theory in higher dimensions can be defined similarly.

The quiver is particularly convenient for representing conformal gauge theory. The structure of the quiver makes it easy to check whether the theory preserves conformal symmetry.

<text>Erhai or Er Lake (), is an alpine fault lake in Dali City, Dali Prefecture, Yunnan province, China. Erhai was also known as Yeyuze () or Kunming Lake () in ancient times.

==Etymology==
The character &quot;洱&quot; (er) does not have the same meaning as ear (耳). During the Han to Tang dynasty, there was an ancient ethnic named &quot;Kunming Yi&quot; or Kunming Barbarian () lived in the neighbouring region of Erhai lake. Therefore, the lake was also called &quot;Kunming Lake&quot;. The &quot;Kunming Yi&quot; has another name &quot;Kun-mi&quot; (). In the following time, Chinese literature recorded the name &quot;昆弥&quot; as &quot;昆弭&quot; (Kun-mi) that &quot;弭&quot; is a rebus of &quot;弥&quot;. And the name of the lake was also changed to the character &quot;渳&quot; (mi) which has a water-meaning radical () attached to it. Fang Guoyu believe the name &quot;洱&quot; (er) was simplified from &quot;渳&quot;, after that the name &quot;Erhai&quot; continues to this day.

According to Bai scholar&#x27;s research, the &quot;Yeyu&quot; in the Chinese name &quot;Yeyuze&quot; (&quot;ze&quot; [泽] means lake) is evolved from Bai language which means &quot;lower water&quot;, the pronunciation written in IPA as . In the Bai language Dali dialect, the &quot;lower&quot; () is also pronounced . Xu Lin believe the Chinese name &quot;洱&quot; is evolved from .

==Geography==

Erhai is situated at above sea level. In size, the North-South length of the lake is and the East-West width is roughly . Its area is , making it the second largest highland lake in China, after Dianchi Lake. Its circumference reaches , its average depth is of and the total storage capacity of .

The lake serves as a backdrop to all of Dali City and sandwiches Dali Town in the west against the Cang Mountain. The lake&#x27;s head is at Shangguan Town, its northern extremity, and its southernmost point is at Xiaguan Town. The lake receives water from the Miju and Mici Rivers in the north, the Bolou River in the east, and smaller streams from the Cang Mountains in the west. Yangbi River, to the south, is the lake&#x27;s outlet and eventually flows into the Lancang River (Mekong River).

==Attractions==
The lakeshore can be explored by hiking. Highlights include Erhai Park and the Butterfly Springs on the Western bank. Islands on the lake – including Guanyin Ge, Jinsuo Island (), Nanzhao Folklore Island () and Xiaoputuo Island () – are also available for visits.

The lake is an important food source for the local people (Bais), who are famous for their fishing method: their trained cormorants catch fish and return them to fishmongers. The birds are prevented from swallowing their fish by rings fixed around their neck.

==Biodiversity==
There is, or was, a rich biodiversity in Erhai. It is one of three major Yunnan lakes with a high number of endemics, the two other being Fuxian and Dian (Dianchi). Of the 23 fish species and subspecies known from Erhai, 8 are endemic: &quot;Cyprinus barbatus, C. daliensis&quot;, &quot;C. longipectoralis&quot;, &quot;C. megalophthalmus&quot;, &quot;Paracobitis erhaiensis&quot;, &quot;Poropuntius daliensis&quot; (syn. &quot;Barbodes daliensis&quot;), &quot;P. exiguus&quot; (syn. &quot;B. exigua&quot;) and &quot;Zacco taliensis&quot; (syn. &quot;Schizothorax taliensis&quot;). Among these, only &quot;C. barbatus&quot; and &quot;C. longipectoralis&quot; have been recorded since the year 2000; the remaining have not been recorded in decades and are likely extinct. A few of the non-endemic natives have also been extirpated from the lake. In contrast, the lake is now home to more than 10 introduced fish species.

A few native hydrophytes have also disappeared from the lake.

The lake used to be a royal deer ranch for the Nanzhao Kingdom.

<doc id="645206" wikidata="Q7164362" url="?curid=645206" title="Penny Crayon">
<text>Penny Crayon is a 1989 British children&#x27;s television series that tells the adventures of a very intellectual and well-meaning (but occasionally mischievous) schoolgirl from London who loves to draw, and her escapades accompanied by her best friend, Dennis. Using the magic crayons that she always carries with her, she brings everything that she ever draws to life, to either help them on their adventures or to get them out of tricky situations, and usually creating a world of chaos until it is either erased or washed away.

The origins of Penny&#x27;s crayons was never explained or hinted at in the series; however series creator Peter Maddocks released a prequel story, along with an adaptation of the episode &#x27;Dickens of a Mess&#x27;, in digital format in 2012, which told the story of how Penny came to have her magic crayons.

==Characters==
*Penny Crayon is a highly intelligent and resourceful schoolgirl, with a Northern accent and who loves drawing. She has magic crayons and pencils that can draw on any surface including brick walls, cave interiors and even the inside of a whale&#x27;s mouth. She is voiced by comedy actress Su Pollard, whose face Penny visually resembles.
*Dennis Pillbeam (his surname is never given on-screen but is mentioned in literature accompanying the series) is Penny&#x27;s best friend, an excitable, good-natured yet simple boy who can often be heard praising Penny&#x27;s cleverness or bravery. He was the only other regular character in the series, voiced by Peter Hawkins, who had also done voice-work for Maddocks Animation&#x27;s previous television series.

==Origin and production==
&quot;Penny Crayon&quot; was produced for the BBC in the United Kingdom. first broadcast weekly as part of Children&#x27;s BBC on BBC1 from 14 September 1989. It was made by Maddocks Animation, which had previously produced &quot;Jimbo and the Jet-Set&quot; and &quot;The Family-Ness&quot;, and utilized much of the same production staff, as well as featuring the vocal talents of Peter Hawkins in all three series.

Twelve episodes were produced in a single production run, although spread across two separate broadcast runs in 1989 and 1990 respectively. The series was subsequently repeated a number of times, airing into the early 2000s and was also later repeated on GMTV2 with Bertha.

&quot;Penny Crayon&quot; was originally created by Maddocks as a gag comic in the girls&#x27; magazine &quot;Jinty&quot; in 1976. In animation, the character was introduced in 1988 in an early episode of &quot;Playdays&quot; (broadcast at that time under its original title of &quot;Playbus&quot;, and before the show&#x27;s rotation of stories featuring recurring characters had fully set in place). In that story, not animated but read out over static images drawn by Peter Maddocks, when a school trip to the zoo is rained off, Penny tries to entertain her disappointed classmates stuck inside school by drawing zoo animals on the walls of the school hall (including a Tyrannosaurus rex), which come to life and cause havoc around the school. When she and Dennis can&#x27;t catch them to erase them, she eventually draws a huge cage to put them all in, thus allowing her to rub them out. 
This early version of Penny had darker hair – she was given blonde hair in the following series to match that of Su Pollard, and both her and Dennis&#x27; appearance was modified for the subsequent series. One of Dennis&#x27; lines (&quot;Mum will be furious when we get home and she hears about this!&quot;) suggests that Penny and Dennis might be siblings, though this was never mentioned in the series. The story was one of several submitted by independent writers for the new daily series, and although a selection of rotating story characters was soon picked for &quot;Playbus&quot;, it was well-enough received that then-Head of Children&#x27;s Programmes Anna Home recommended that Hawkins might develop it as a series.

Due to the original &quot;Penny Crayon&quot; story appearing on &quot;Playbus&quot;, some episode guides to the series erroneously list thirteen episodes.

==Episodes==

==Home releases==
In 1989 and 1990, Parkfield Publishing released two video cassettes with four episodes on each one.

In 1992, TeleVideo (A division of Direct Entertainment Group) released three videos with four episodes on each tape.

In 1994, Carlton Home Entertainment released a single video with only four episodes.

Several book adaptations and a 1990 annual were also released.

<doc id="645208" wikidata="Q1965418" url="?curid=645208" title="Equant">
<text>Equant (or punctum aequans) is a mathematical concept developed by Claudius Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD to account for the observed motion of the planets. The equant is used to explain the observed speed change in different stages of the planetary orbit. This planetary concept allowed Ptolemy to keep the theory of uniform circular motion alive by stating that the path of heavenly bodies was uniform around one point and circular around another point.

Ptolemy does not have a word for the equant – he used expressions such as &quot;the eccentre producing the mean motion&quot;.

== Placement ==
The equant point (shown in the diagram by the large • ), is placed so that it is directly opposite to Earth from the deferent&#x27;s center, known as the &quot;eccentric&quot; (represented by the × ). A planet or the center of an epicycle (a smaller circle carrying the planet) was conceived to move at a constant angular speed with respect to the equant. To a hypothetical observer placed at the equant point, the epicycle&#x27;s center (indicated by the small · ) would appear to move at a steady angular speed. However, the epicycle&#x27;s center will not move at a constant speed along its deferent.

=== Motivation ===
The reason for the implementation of the equant was to maintain a semblance of constant circular motion of celestial bodies, a long-standing article of faith originated by Aristotle for philosophical reasons, while also allowing for the best match of the computations of the observed movements of the bodies, particularly in the size of the apparent retrograde motion of all Solar System bodies except the Sun and the Moon.

The equant model has a body in motion on a circular path not centered on the Earth. The moving object&#x27;s speed will vary during its orbit around the outer circle (dashed line), faster in the bottom half and slower in the top half, but the motion is considered uniform because the planet goes through equal angles in equal times from the perspective of the equant point. The angular speed of the object is non-uniform when viewed from any other point within the orbit.

Applied without an epicycle (as for the Sun), using an equant allows for the angular speed to be correct at perigee and apogee, with a ratio of formula_1 (where formula_2 is the orbital eccentricity). But compared with the Keplerian orbit, the equant method causes the body to spend too little time far from the Earth and too much close to the Earth. For example, when the eccentric anomaly is π/2, the Keplerian model says that an amount of time of formula_3 will have elapsed since perigee (where the period is formula_4, see Kepler equation), whereas the equant model gives formula_5 which is a little more. Furthermore, the true anomaly at this point, according to the equant model, will be only formula_6 whereas in the Keplerian model it is formula_7 which is more. However, for small eccentricity the error is very small, being asymptotic to the eccentricity to the third power.

=== Equation ===
The angle whose vertex is at the center of the deferent, and whose sides intersect the planet and the equant, respectively, is a function of time as follows:

: formula_8

where is the constant angular speed seen from the equant which is situated at a distance when the radius of the deferent is .

==Discovery and use==
Ptolemy introduced the equant in &quot;Almagest&quot;. The evidence that the equant was a required adjustment to Aristotelian physics relied on observations made by himself and a certain &quot;Theon&quot; (perhaps, Theon of Smyrna).

===Hipparchus===
In models of planetary motion that precede Ptolemy, generally attributed to Hipparchus, the eccentric and epicycles were already a feature. The Roman writer Pliny in the 1st century CE, who apparently had access to writings of late Greek astronomers, and not being an astronomer himself, still correctly identified the lines of apsides for the five known planets and where they pointed in the zodiac. Such data requires the concept of eccentric centers of motion. 

Before around the year 430 BCE, Meton and Euktemon of Athens observed differences in the lengths of the seasons. This can be observed in the lengths of seasons, given by equinoxes and solstices that indicate when the Sun traveled 90 degrees along its path. Though others tried, Hipparchos calculated and presented the most exact lengths of seasons around 130 BCE.

According to these calculations, Spring lasted about , Summer about , Fall about , and Winter about , showing that seasons did indeed have differences in lengths. This was later used as evidence for the zodiacal inequality, or the appearance of the Sun to move at a rate that is not constant, with some parts of its orbit including it moving faster or slower. The Sun&#x27;s annual motion as understood by Greek astronomy up to this point did not account for this, as it assumed the Sun had a perfectly circular orbit that was centered around the Earth that it traveled around at a constant speed. According to the astronomer Hipparchos, moving the center of the Sun&#x27;s path slightly away from Earth would satisfy the observed motion of the Sun rather painlessly, thus making the Sun&#x27;s orbit eccentric.

Most of what we know about Hipparchus comes to us through citations of his works by Ptolemy. Hipparchus&#x27; models&#x27; features explained differences in the length of the seasons on Earth (known as the &quot;first anomaly&quot;), and the appearance of retrograde motion in the planets (known as the &quot;second anomaly&quot;). But Hipparchus was unable to make the predictions about the location and duration of retrograde motions of the planets match observations; he could match location, or he could match duration, but not both simultaneously.

===Ptolemy===
Between Hipparchus&#x27;s model and Ptolemy&#x27;s there was an intermediate model that was proposed to account for the motion of planets in general based on the observed motion of Mars. In this model, the deferent had a center that was also the equant, that could be moved along the deferent&#x27;s line of symmetry in order to match to a planet&#x27;s retrograde motion. This model, however, still did not align with the actual motion of planets, as noted by Hipparchos. This was true specifically regarding the actual spacing and widths of retrograde arcs, which could be seen later according to Ptolemy&#x27;s model and compared.

Ptolemy himself rectified this contradiction by introducing the equant in his writing when he separated it from the center of the deferent, making both it and the deferent&#x27;s center their own distinct parts of the model and making the deferent&#x27;s center stationary throughout the motion of a planet. The location was determined by the deferent and epicycle, while the duration was determined by uniform motion around the equant. He did this without much explanation or justification for how he arrived at the point of its creation, deciding only to present it formally and concisely with proofs as with any scientific publication. Even in his later works where he recognized the lack of explanation, he made no effort to explain further.

Ptolemy&#x27;s model of astronomy was used as a technical method that could answer questions regarding astrology and predicting planets positions for almost 1,500 years, even though the equant and eccentric were regarded by many later astronomers as violations of pure Aristotelian physics which presumed all motion to be centered on the Earth. It has been reported that Ptolemy&#x27;s model of the cosmos was so popular and revolutionary, in fact, that it is usually very difficult to find any details of previously used models, except from writings by Ptolemy himself.

===From Copernicus to Kepler===
For many centuries rectifying these violations was a preoccupation among scholars, culminating in the solutions of Ibn al-Shatir and Copernicus. Ptolemy&#x27;s predictions, which required constant review and corrections by concerned scholars over those centuries, culminated in the observations of Tycho Brahe at Uraniborg.

It was not until Johannes Kepler published his &quot;Astronomia Nova&quot;, based on the data he and Tycho collected at Uraniborg, that Ptolemy&#x27;s model of the heavens was entirely supplanted by a new geometrical model.

== Critics ==
The equant solved the last major problem of accounting for the anomalistic motion of the planets but was believed by some to compromise the principles of the ancient Greek philosophers, namely uniform circular motion about the Earth. The uniformity was generally assumed to be observed from the center of the deferent, and since that happens at only one point, only non-uniform motion is observed from any other point. Ptolemy displaced the observation point from the center of the deferent to the equant point. This can be seen as violating the axiom of uniform circular motion.

Noted critics of the equant include the Persian astronomer Nasir al-Din Tusi who developed the Tusi couple as an alternative explanation, and Nicolaus Copernicus, whose alternative was a new pair of small epicycles for each deferent. Dislike of the equant was a major motivation for Copernicus to construct his heliocentric system. 

The violation of uniform circular motion around the center of the deferent bothered many thinkers, especially Copernicus, who mentions the equant as a &quot;monstrous construction&quot; in &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot;. Copernicus&#x27; displacement of the Earth from the center of the cosmos obviated the primary need for Ptolemy&#x27;s epicycles: It explained retrograde movement as an effect of perspective, due to the relative motion of the earth and the planets. However, it did not explain non-uniform motion of the Sun and Moon, whose relative motions Copernicus did not change (even though he did recast the Sun orbiting the Earth as the Earth orbiting the Sun, the two are geometrically equivalent). Moving the center of planetary motion from the Earth to the Sun did not remove the need for something to explain the non-uniform motion of the Sun, for which Copernicus substituted two (or several) smaller epicycles instead of an equant.
