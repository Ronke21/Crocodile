<text>Clan Fergusson is a Scottish clan. Known as the &quot;Sons of Fergus&quot; they have spread across Scotland from as far as Ross-shire in the north to Dumfriesshire in the south.

==History==
===Origins===

The Scottish Gaelic patronymic of Fergusson is &quot;MacFhearghuis&quot; which can also be translated as &quot;son of the angry&quot;. There is a tradition that attributes a common ancestry to the various distinct families bearing the name of Fergusson, however there is no evidence to support this and the heraldry of the chief&#x27;s family is significantly different from that of other Fergusson families.

The Fergussons of Argyll claim descent from Fergus Mór, king of Dál Riata who came from Ireland across Argyll. Most shields of this family include a Boar&#x27;s head which indicates a connection with the early Scots of Dál Riata.

There is evidence that links the Fergussons of Ayrshire and Dumfries with Fergus of Galloway, who was an important figure during the reigns of David I of Scotland and Malcolm IV of Scotland. Fergus of Galloway restored Whithorn church and also founded Dundrennan Abbey. He died in 1161 at Holyrood Abbey. The Earls of Carrick descend from Fergus of Galloway.

The Fergussons held lands at Kilkerran from probably the 12th century, although the first certain record is that of John Fergusson of Kilkerran in 1464. This John Fergusson may have been descended from John, son of Fergus who was a witness to a charter of Edward Bruce, which was signed in 1314 after the Battle of Bannockburn.

There were Fergussons all over southern Carrick by 1600, who all acknowledged Fergusson of Kilkerran as their clan chief.

===17th century and Civil War===

The Clan Fergusson allied themselves with the Clan Kennedy chiefs, the Earls of Cassillis in their feud against the Kennedy Lairds of Bargany. The Fergussons were part of John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis&#x27;s band in 1601 when a skirmish took place at Maybole where the Kennedy Laird of Bargany was killed.

The Ayrshire Fergussons adopted the Protestant faith during Protestant Reformation whilst Sir John Fergusson of Kilkerran fought for the royalists during the Scottish Civil War.

===18th century===

Sir John Fergusson, who was born in about 1653 was a distinguished lawyer and a member of the Faculty of Advocates. In 1703 he was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia. In 1735 his son, James Fergusson became a judge of the Supreme Court and was given the title Lord Kilkerran. General Sir Charles Fergusson, the 7th Baronet served in the British Army for almost forty years.

<text>Brenda Nokuzola Fassie (3 November 1964 – 9 May 2004) was a South African singer, songwriter, dancer and activist. Affectionately called MaBrrr by her fans, she is also known as the &quot;Queen of African Pop&quot; or the &quot;Madonna of The Townships.&quot; Fassie was a legendary figure in South African music, celebrated for her powerful voice, captivating stage presence, and commitment to social justice, often called one of the most influential and greatest musicians in the African Continent. Despite her outrageous and controversial stage presence, her name, Nokuzola, means &quot;quiet&quot;, &quot;calm&quot;, or &quot;peace&quot;.

== Biography ==
Brenda Nokuzola Fassie was born in Langa, Cape Town on 3 November 1964, the youngest of nine children. She was named after the American singer Brenda Lee. Her father died when she was only two years old; with the help of her mother, a pianist, she soon started earning money by singing for tourists.

When she was 16 years old in 1981, she received a visit by Hendrick &quot;Koloi&quot; Lebona. As a result, she left Cape Town for Soweto, Johannesburg, to seek her fortune as a singer. Fassie first joined the vocal group Joy (filling in for one of the members who was on maternity leave) and later became the lead singer for a township music group called Brenda and the Big Dudes. She had a son, Bongani, in 1985 by a fellow Big Dudes musician. She married Nhlanhla Mbambo in 1989, but the pair divorced in 1991. Around this time she became addicted to cocaine and her career suffered as a result.

With very outspoken views and frequent visits to the poorer townships of Johannesburg, as well as songs about life in the townships, Fassie enjoyed tremendous popularity. She also used her music to oppose the apartheid regime in South Africa. In 1990, she released the song &quot;Black President&quot; as a tribute to Nelson Mandela, a political prisoner and later the first Black president of South Africa. Known best for her songs &quot;Weekend Special&quot; and &quot;Too Late for Mama&quot;, Fassie was dubbed &quot;The Madonna of the Townships&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2001.

In 1995, she was discovered in a hotel with the body of her female lover, Poppie Sihlahla, who had died of an apparent overdose. Fassie underwent rehabilitation and got her career back on track. However, she still had drug problems, and returned to drug rehabilitation clinics about 30 times in her life. From 1996 on she released several solo albums, including &quot;Now Is the Time&quot; (1996), &quot;Paparazzi&quot; (1997), &quot;Memeza&quot; (1998) and &quot;Nomakanjani&quot; (1999). Most of her albums became multi-platinum sellers in South Africa, of which &quot;Memeza&quot; was the best-selling album in South Africa in 1998.

== Death ==
On the morning of 26 April 2004, Fassie collapsed at her home in Buccleuch, Gauteng, and was admitted into a hospital in Sunninghill. The press were initially told that she had suffered cardiac arrest, but later reported that she had slipped into a coma as a result of an asthma attack. The post-mortem report revealed that Fassie had taken an overdose of cocaine on the night of her collapse, and this was the cause of her coma. She stopped breathing and suffered brain damage from lack of oxygen. Fassie was visited in the hospital by Nelson Mandela, Winnie Mandela, and Thabo Mbeki, and her condition was front-page news in South African papers. She died aged 39 on 9 May 2004 in hospital, without regaining consciousness, after her life support machines were turned off. Her family (including her son, Bongani Fassie, and her long-term partner) were at her side when she died.

== Recognition ==
Fassie won five South African Music Awards: Best Female Artist and Song of the Year in 1999, Best-Selling Release of the Decade and Best Song of the Decade in 2004, and Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. She also won three Kora Awards: Most Promising Female Artist of Africa and Best Female Artist of Africa in 1996, and the Jury Special Award in 2001. She was voted 17th in the Top 100 Great South Africans.

Her son Bongani &quot;Bongz&quot; Fassie performed &quot;I&#x27;m So Sorry&quot;, a song dedicated to his mother, on the soundtrack to the 2005 Academy Award-winning movie &quot;Tsotsi&quot;. In March 2006 a life-size bronze sculpture of Fassie by artist Angus Taylor was installed outside Bassline, a music venue in Johannesburg.

<doc id="653149" wikidata="Q16984113" url="?curid=653149" title="Highland Rim">
<text>The Highland Rim is a geographic term for the area in Tennessee, North Alabama, and Kentucky which surrounds the Central Basin. Geologically, the Central Basin is a dome. The Highland Rim is a cuesta surrounding the basin, and the border where the difference in elevation is sharply pronounced is an escarpment. 

==Geology and physiography==
The Highland Rim is a physiographic section of the larger Interior Low Plateaus province, which in turn is part of the larger Interior Plains physiographic division. Most of the Highland Rim is located in U.S. EPA Ecoregion 71, Interior Plateau, which is a part of the Eastern Temperate Forest.

The sections of the Highland Rim are referred to the four cardinal directions, e.g., &quot;Northern Highland Rim&quot;, etc. The Highland Rim is rather continuous and any division of it, including the ones made below, are somewhat arbitrary. The term &quot;highland&quot; here is relative: it is certainly higher than the basin it surrounds, but it nonetheless is seldom at an elevation above above sea level and never more than about above sea level except where interrupted, primarily to the southeast, by outliers of the Cumberland Plateau. With the exception of a few broad stream bottoms, the land is characterized by ridges and valleys with a few fairly low hills. The entire region is well watered with many perennial streams. There are occasional waterfalls which sometimes delineate the Highland Rim from the Central Basin which it surrounds.

===Western Highland Rim===
The Western Highland Rim is encountered a few miles west of Nashville and extends to the western valley of the Tennessee River. The area is a hilly area that is bisected by the Tennessee River and the Cumberland River valleys. Underlying bedrock of the region is chiefly Mississippian limestone, chert, shale, and sandstone with exposures of Devonian, Silurian, Ordovician, and Cambrian limestone, chert, and shale. In the northern part of the Western Highland Rim, sinkholes readily occur in an area with a southern extension of the Pennyroyal plateau of Kentucky, where the karst is best developed on the Mississippian St. Louis Limestone and the Ste. Genevieve Limestone. 

===Eastern Highland Rim===
The Eastern Rim rises approximately fifty miles east of Nashville and is bordered to its east by even higher terrain, the Cumberland Plateau. Erosion has exposed carbonate bedrock of Late Paleozoic age. These carbonate rocks contain variable amounts of chert and are often interbedded with fine grained clastic rocks. As a result, these rocks are more resistant to erosion than the underlying purer limestones of the Lower (Early) Paleozoic. The geology is diverse and is
typically limestone at valley floors (around elevation) and sandstone on ridges (to around 1,000 feet). The constituent bedrock is composed primarily of Mississippian aged St. Louis, and Warsaw limestones with Fort Payne chert underlain by Chattanooga Shale that forms a large part of the escarpment. This area is mostly undulating plains, hills, and karst.

===Northern Highland Rim===
The Northern Highland Rim is encountered a few miles north of Nashville and extends to the Kentucky border, and the region of Kentucky adjacent to it called the Pennyroyal is largely a continuation of it under another name.

===Southern Highland Rim===
For the most part the Southern Rim is the farthest from Nashville, rising at some points just a few miles north of the border with Alabama. The landforms are continuous with those in adjacent portions of Alabama, although perhaps the most spectacular landforms of any portion of the Rim are to be found there.

The stratigraphy of the Southern Highland Rim is primarily composed of flat-lying limestones, dolomites, and shales, and to a much lesser extent, of cherts, siltstones, mudstones, and very fine grained to conglomeratic sandstones.

<text>Acid-free paper is paper that, if infused in water, yields a neutral or basic pH (7 or slightly greater). It can be made from any cellulose fiber as long as the active acid pulp is eliminated during processing. It is also lignin- and sulfur-free. Acid-free paper addresses the problem of preserving documents and preserving artwork for long periods.

== Overview ==
Paper made from wood-based pulp that has not had its lignin removed turns yellow, becomes brittle and deteriorates. When exposed to light and/or heat, the molecules in the acidic paper will break down faster. Acidic wood-pulp paper became commonplace in the late 19th century, and in the 1930s. William Barrow (a chemist and librarian) published a report about the deterioration of acidic paper in the libraries. For fear of the gradual disintegration of written materials, measures have since been taken to improve the quality of paper.

During production, acid-free paper may be treated with a mild base (usually calcium or magnesium bicarbonate) to neutralize the natural acids occurring in wood pulp, and it may also be buffered to prevent the formation of additional acids (as may develop from the application of sizing).

The bicarbonate is added in excess, to supply the paper with an alkaline reserve to provide protection from further attack by acids remaining in the paper or supplied by the environment (e.g. atmospheric sulfur dioxide). The bicarbonate during drying loses carbon dioxide and water and is converted to calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate. For paper to last at least 100 years it must have an alkaline reserve of 2 percent or more.

Much commercially produced paper is acid-free but this is largely the result of a shift from kaolin clay to precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) as the main filler material in the pulp. PCC reacts with acids and requires the pulp to be chemically neutral or alkaline. The sizing additives mixed into the pulp and/or applied to the surface of the paper must also be acid-free.

Alkaline paper has a life expectancy of over 1,000 years for the best paper and 500 years for average grades. The making of alkaline paper has several other advantages in addition to the preservation benefits afforded to the publications and documents printed on it. Because there are fewer corrosive chemicals used in making alkaline paper, the process is much easier on the machinery, reducing downtime and maintenance and extending machines&#x27; useful life. The process is also significantly more environmentally friendly. Waste water and byproducts of the paper making process can be recycled; energy can be saved in the drying and refining process; and alkaline paper can be more easily recycled.

==Standards==
=== Permanent paper ===

The company Hercules Incorporated developed the first alkaline sizing in the 1950s that made acid-free paper possible. Despite the advances in paper making and the identification of and concern around the brittle book problem, it took decades before the adoption of ANSI NISO Standard Z39.48-1984 - &quot;Permanence of Paper for Publications and Documents in Libraries&quot; in 1984. This voluntary standard covered pH value, tear resistance, alkaline reserve, and lignin thresholds for paper to last thousands of years and was developed to encourage the use of acid-free paper in library materials. The development of the initial standard was a result of the work of the Council on Library Resources, which effectively lobbied ANSI to adopt the guidelines.

In 1986, Standards Committee II of NISO was established to expand Z39.48-1984 to develop standards for coated paper, and was again called upon in 1988 to review and revise the standards for uncoated paper.

There are various standards for &quot;acid-free&quot; paper, with differing requirements. In some quarters, slightly-acidic paper having a pH between 6 and 7 is often also considered &quot;acid-free&quot;. Acid-free (alkaline) paper that additionally is &quot;uncoated&quot; and meets certain &quot;standards for folding and tearing&quot; is authorized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to carry the following notice: &quot;The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the American National Standard for Information Sciences—Permanence of Paper for Printed Library Materials, ANSI/NISO Z39.48-1992.&quot;

The objective of ANSI Z39.48-1992 &quot;is to establish criteria for coated and uncoated paper to last several hundred years&quot; under optimal conditions in libraries and archives. The desired outcome of the standard is to reduce future preservation problems.

The scope of the standard is to cover publications and documents bought and maintained by libraries and archives. Such works include scholarly journals, periodicals, monographs, government documents, original documents, and significant works in fiction and non-fiction.

An equivalent international standard, ISO 9706, was published in 1994.

Manufacturers of acid-free paper can indicate the compliance of their product with the test requirements of the ISO 9706 or ANSI Z39.48-1992 standards using a circled infinity symbol (Unicode code point 267E, ♾).

=== Archival paper ===

Archival paper is an especially permanent, durable acid-free paper. Archival paper is meant to be used for publications of high legal, historical, or significant value. In the USA, such paper must also be approved in accordance with the ANSI standards. The international standard for &quot;permanent&quot; paper is ISO 9706 and for &quot;archival&quot; paper, the standard is ISO 11108.

Often, cotton rag paper is used for archival purposes, as it is not made from wood-based pulp. Thus, &quot;archival paper&quot; is sometimes broken down into two categories:
* Conservation-grade—acid-free, buffered paper made from wood-based pulp.
* Archival-grade (also Museum-grade)—cotton rag paper made from cotton pulp.

<doc id="653152" wikidata="Q4048896" url="?curid=653152" title="SS River Clyde">
<text>SS &quot;River Clyde&quot; was a British collier built by Russell &amp; Co of Port Glasgow on the Firth of Clyde and completed in March 1905. In the First World War the Admiralty requisitioned her for the Royal Navy and in 1915 she took part in the Gallipoli landings. After the war she was repaired and sold to Spanish owners, with whom she spent a long civilian career trading in the Mediterranean before being scrapped in 1966.

==Propulsion==
&quot;River Clyde&quot; had nine corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of that heated three 180 lbf/in2 single-ended boilers with a combined heating surface of to raise steam for her three-cylinder triple expansion engine. The engine was built by J. G. Kincaid &amp; Co. of Greenock and was rated at 374 NHP.

==Pre-war service==
In February 1909, the &quot;River Clyde&quot; was towed into Moreton Bay by the &quot;Falls of Orchy&quot;. The &quot;River Clyde&quot; had been carrying coal from Newcastle, N.S.W. to Manila. She was on her way back to Newcastle, when she ran out of bunker coal after encountering adverse weather. She had been adrift for 25 hours, after first having used wood from her hold ceiling and bulkheads to fuel her boilers to divert to Moreton Bay and recoal.

==First World War==

===A Trojan Horse===

During the planning of landings at Gallipoli, Commander Edward Unwin, formerly of the proposed the use of an anonymous-looking collier as a Trojan Horse, carrying about 2,000 troops, to be run onto V Beach just after the first wave of about 2,000 troops had landed, doubling the number of troops in the first wave. On 12 April 1915 &quot;River Clyde&quot; was purchased by the Admiralty to be adapted to a landing ship for the joint French and British invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula. She retained her name. Openings were cut in her steel hull as sally ports from which troops would emerge onto broad gangways and then to a steam hopper (a flat-bottomed, shallow-draft boat used to collect spoil from a dredger).

A bridge of three lighters with special covered decks to make a pontoon bridge from the ship to the beach in case the gap between the ship and the lighter was too great, a survey of the beach being impractical. Number 3 Armoured Car Squadron Royal Naval Air Service (Lieutenant-Commander Josiah Wedgwood) was ordered to use 11 of his Maxim guns on the ship. Boiler plate and sandbags were mounted on the fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle, the upper deck and bridge for the guns. Work began on painting &quot;River Clyde&quot;″s hull sandy yellow as camouflage, but this was incomplete by the time of the landing.

===Mudros harbour===
By 11 April 1915 &quot;River Clyde&quot; was in the natural harbour of Mudros on the Aegean island of Lemnos, where French and British ships were assembling for the landings. The troops on &quot;River Clyde&quot; took the opportunity to practise quick disembarkation in full marching order; they were issued with a pamphlet containing excerpts from textbooks on landings and combined operations with the Navy. The troop ship reached Mudros from Alexandria in Egypt and transferred the 1st Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers and a company of the 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers (86th Brigade), two companies of the 2nd Battalion, the Hampshire Regiment, a platoon of the Anson Battalion, the GHQ Signals Section, the Worcestershire Regiment Field Company RE and other detachments of the 88th Brigade, 29th Division to &quot;River Clyde&quot;.

==Landing at Cape Helles==

===V Beach===

On 25 April 1915 &quot;River Clyde&quot; sailed to take part in the landing at Cape Helles. She was carrying 2,000 soldiers; mostly from 86th Brigade, units of the 29th Division, the 1st Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers and men from the 2nd Battalion, the Hampshire Regiment, the 1st Battalion, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Unwin beached &quot;River Clyde&quot; at V Beach beneath the Sedd el Bahr castle, on the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula. The plan failed and the &quot;River Clyde&quot;, beached under the guns of the Ottoman defenders, became a death trap. Three attempts to land made by companies of Munsters, Royal Dublins and Hampshires were costly failures. Further landing attempts were abandoned and the surviving soldiers waited until nightfall before trying again. Members of &quot;River Clyde&quot;″s crew maintained the footways from the ship to the beach and recovered the wounded.

===Subsequent events===
After the Helles beach-head was established, V Beach became the base for the French contingent and &quot;River Clyde&quot; remained beached as a quay and breakwater. Her condensers provided fresh water and her holds became a field dressing station. She remained a constant target for Turkish gunners ashore.

==Victoria Cross==
Six Victoria Crosses were awarded at V Beach to sailors or men from the Royal Naval Division who had attempted to maintain the bridge of lighters and recover the wounded, including Commander Unwin, Sub-Lieutenant Arthur Tisdall, Able Seaman William Williams, Seaman George Samson and Midshipmen George Drewry and Wilfred Malleson. Lieutenant Colonel Charles Doughty-Wylie was awarded a posthumous VC, for leading the attack finally to capture Sedd el Bahr on the morning 26 April, during which William Cosgrove of the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was also awarded a VC.

==Civilian service==
In 1919, &quot;River Clyde&quot; was refloated by the Ocean Salvage Co. and taken to Malta. The British Government refused a proposal to purchase her to return to the UK for mooring in the River Thames as a monument to the landings because of the cost. She was repaired at Malta and sold in February 1920 to civilian Spanish owners. She operated as a tramp steamer in the Mediterranean, first as &quot;Angela&quot; and then &quot;Maruja y Aurora&quot;. Maruja and Aurora were the names of the eldest child of each of the two partners in the company, Gumersindo Junquera Blanco and Vicente Figaredo Herrero. She was seized by Spanish Nationalist forces at Santander in August 1937 and used by the Nationalist navy, during which time she captured the steamship &quot;Margarita&quot;. She made trips between Santander and Ferrol and carried troops between Gijón and Bilbao. Returned to her former owners 18 months later, she resumed her commercial role; she rescued three British airmen during the Second World War. In 1965 there was an attempt to buy and preserve &quot;River Clyde&quot; but the British Government were unwilling to purchase her. In 1966 she was sold to Desguaces y Salvamentos S.A. for £42,000; scrapping at Avilés, Spain, commenced on 15 March 1966.

<text>Otisco Lake is the easternmost of New York&#x27;s eleven Finger Lakes. The lake is located in Onondaga County, southwest of the city of Syracuse.

==History==
Otisco Lake&#x27;s name may have been derived from the Iroquois name for the lake&#x27;s outlet, Nine Mile Creek, &quot;Us-te-ke&quot;, meaning &quot;bitter-nut-hickory&quot;. At least one older map, published in 1825, has the name spelled as &quot;Ostisco&quot;. The name may also have been derived from the word &quot;ostickney&quot;, meaning &quot;waters much dried away&quot;, or from the Onondaga word &quot;ostick&quot;, meaning &quot;the water is low&quot;.

Prior to European settlement, the lake was used by the Onondaga people for seasonal fishing and hunting, however no permanent settlements were known to exist. After the Revolutionary War, lands surrounding Otisco Lake were given to soldiers as payment for their service in the war. The first house was erected near the head of Otisco Lake by Oliver Tuttle in 1804, in what is today the Town of Otisco.

In 1869, Otisco Lake was made larger with the construction of a dam near the lake&#x27;s outlet, which enabled the lake to be used as a reservoir for the Erie Canal. The dam&#x27;s construction raised lake levels by , and flooded a road at the southern end of the lake. To re-build the road, a causeway was built out of hemlock logs. The causeway was damaged by storms and allowed to deteriorate before being reconstructed in 1983.

Otisco Lake has been used as a source for public drinking water for residents in the southern and western half of Onondaga County since 1908. In 1909, lake levels were increased by an additional when the dam was raised to increase the lake&#x27;s capacity. Today, the lake&#x27;s use as a public water supply is managed by the Onondaga County Water Authority. In 2011, Otisco Lake provided of water per day.

==Description==
Otisco Lake is approximately long and wide at its widest point. The lake has an average depth of and reaches a maximum depth of . It has a surface area of and can hold of water. The lake&#x27;s outflow enters first Onondaga Lake via Ninemile Creek and then Lake Ontario via the Seneca and Oswego rivers.

Otisco Lake is located entirely within Onondaga County and is bordered by the towns of Marcellus, Otisco, and Spafford. Its watershed covers of primarily rural land. Forty-two percent of the watershed is agricultural, 33% is forested and 9% is shrubland. Wetlands and open water account for approximately 13% of the watershed. Nearly half of the homes within the lake&#x27;s watershed are located on or near the lake&#x27;s shore.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Otisco Lake is affected by nonpoint source pollution from agriculture, residential land use and streambank erosion. Pollution from these sources includes pesticides and fertilizers, sedimentation from erosion and poor tillage practices, and runoff from septic systems, lawns and construction sites. Currently the lake is experiencing severe problems brought on by zebra mussels which were introduced to the lake water via boaters.

==Recreation==

Closest of the Finger Lakes to the City of Syracuse, the lake is a popular recreational destination in the summer. On the first day of bass season, usually around the end of the second week in June, an annual fishing derby is held.

A county park and a public boat launch are available for public use, and two private boat launches are located along the southeastern portion of the lake.

<text>Owasco Lake is the sixth largest and third easternmost of the Finger Lakes of New York in the United States.

==History==
Owasco Lake&#x27;s name may have been derived from the Iroquois word &quot;dwas-co&quot;, meaning &quot;bridge on the water&quot;. The name may also have been derived from the word &quot;was-co&quot;, meaning &quot;floating bridge&quot;. Cayuga territory was found between the territory of the Onondaga and Seneca. Jesuits founded missions among the Cayuga in the mid-17th century. In 1660, there were approximately 1,500 Cayuga.

In the nineteenth century, Owasco Lake was a popular vacation spot for the well-to-do. A casino located just north of Cascade hosted guests traveling by rail along the western length of the lake. Vestiges of the railway remain in the swampy waters, but the casino burned down in the early years of the twentieth century. The &quot;indianist&quot; composer Arthur Farwell camped on the east shore in 1899, before assuming his teaching duties at Cornell University, and wrote a set of piano pieces depicting his experience, entitled &quot;Owasco Memories.&quot; He included a representation of &quot;The Casino Across the Lake.&quot;

==Description==
Owasco Lake is long, with a maximum width of . The lake reaches a maximum depth of and has a surface elevation of above sea level, controlled by a dam on the lake&#x27;s outlet. The lake has a volume of , and drains a watershed of .

The city of Auburn is located at the northern end and takes its drinking water from the lake. The lake lies entirely within the boundaries of Cayuga County, and the watershed boundary includes portions of Onondaga County and Tompkins County. Located at the south end of the lake is the hamlet of Cascade, which consists of a community of cottages, a marina, and a restaurant.

Owasco has the largest catchment area, or watershed, of all the Finger Lakes. This means that the land use has a large impact on water quality, and the lake especially vulnerable to nutrient loading from stormwater run-off. It is also downstream from the villages of Moravia and Groton. Sewage treatment effluent from two communities flows into the lake, which is regulated and permitted by the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation.

Owasco Lake and Skaneateles Lake are the only Finger Lakes that have rules and regulations to conserve water quality. The Owasco Lake Watershed Inspection and Protection Division (OLWIPD) enforces the 1984 Owasco Lake Watershed Rules and Regulations and inspects various types of land use to determine compliance. Owasco Lake is in the process of updating their rules and regulations which will provide protections comparable to Skaneateles Lake if passed.

==Recreation==

Owasco Lake is an excellent recreation spot. Because it is smaller and shallower than many other Finger Lakes, its waters warm up much more quickly, so swimming, water-skiing, and boating are popular. At the lake&#x27;s northern end is Emerson Park, a county park featuring a beach and boat launch. The lake&#x27;s northeastern corner is home to the private Owasco Yacht Club, founded in 1889.

===Fishing===
Fish species present in the lake include lake trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, landlocked salmon, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, black bullhead, pickerel, and walleye. There is access via county owned hard surface boat launch in the park on the north shore for a fee.

<doc id="653173" wikidata="Q131740" url="?curid=653173" title="Wallet">
<text>A wallet is a flat case or pouch, often used to carry small personal items such as physical currency, debit cards, and credit cards; identification documents such as driving licence, identification card, club card; photographs, transit pass, business cards and other paper or laminated cards. Wallets are generally made of fabric or leather, and they are usually pocket-sized and foldable.

Wallets may include a money clip, coin purse, chain fastener, strap, snap, rein, or zipper. There are specialized wallets for holding passports, wearable ID cards, and checkbooks. Some unusual wallets are worn on the wrist or shoe. Wallets may be used as a fashion accessory, or to demonstrate the style, wealth, or social status of the owner.

==Etymology==
The word originated in the late 14th century, meaning &quot;bag&quot; or &quot;knapsack&quot;, from uncertain origin (Norman-French &quot;golette&quot; (little snout)?), or from similar Germanic word, from the Proto-Germanic term &quot;wall&quot;, which means &quot;roll&quot; (from the root &quot;wel&quot;, meaning &quot;to turn or revolve.&quot; (see for example &quot;knapzak&quot; in Dutch and Frisian). The early usage by Shakespeare described something that we would recognise as more like a backpack today. The modern meaning of &quot;flat case for carrying paper money&quot; is first recorded in 1834 in American English.

The ancient Greek word &quot;kibisis&quot;, said to describe the pouch carried the god Hermes and the sack in which the mythical hero Perseus carried the severed head of the monster Medusa, has been typically translated as &quot;wallet&quot;.

==History==
===Ancient Greece===
The classicist A. Y. Campbell set out to answer the question, &quot;What...in ancient literature, are the uses of a wallet?&quot; He deduced, as a Theocritean scholar, that &quot;the wallet was the poor man&#x27;s portable larder; or, poverty apart, it was a thing that you stocked with provisions.&quot; He found that sometimes a man may be eating out of it directly but the most characteristic references allude to its being &quot;replenished as a store&quot;, not in the manner of a lunch basket but more as a survival pack.

===Renaissance===
Wallets were developed after the introduction of paper currency to the West in the 1600s. (The first paper currency was introduced in the New World by the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1690.) Prior to the introduction of paper currency, coin purses (usually simple drawstring leather pouches) were used for storing coins. Early wallets were made primarily of cow or horse leather and included a small pouch for printed calling cards.

In recounting the life of the Elizabethan merchant, John Frampton, Lawrence C. Wroth describes the merchant as, &quot;a young English-man of twenty-five years, decently dressed, ..., wearing a sword, and carrying fixed to his belt something he called a &#x27;bowgett&#x27; (or budget), that is, a leathern pouch or wallet in which he carried his cash, his book of accounts, and small articles of daily necessity&quot;.

===19th century===

In addition to money or currency, a wallet would also be used for carrying dried meat, victuals, &quot;treasures&quot;, and &quot;things not to be exposed&quot;. Wallets originally were used by early Industrial Americans. It was considered &quot;semi-civilized&quot; in 19th century America to carry one&#x27;s wallet on one&#x27;s belt. At this time, carrying goods or a wallet in one&#x27;s pocket was considered uncivilized and uncommon.

In Spain, a wallet was a case for smoking paraphernalia: &quot;Every man would carry a small sheaf of white paper in addition to a small leather wallet which would contain a flint and steel along with a small quantity of so-called &quot;yesca&quot;, being a dried vegetable fibre which a spark would instantly ignite.&quot;

===20th century–present===

The modern bi-fold wallet with multiple &quot;card slots&quot; became standardized in the early 1950s with the introduction of the first credit cards. Some innovations include the introduction of the velcro-closure wallet in the 1970s. Pocket-sized wallets remain popular to this day.

For cryptocurrencies that only exist in cyberspace as entries in some online ledger, a cryptocurrency wallet is a computing tool whose purpose is to securely keep the owner’s secret key, to authenticate the owner, and to let the owner sign transactions securely. A &quot;hardware wallet&quot; is a single purpose computer to do this even more safely.

==Contemporary examples==
Wallets are usually designed to hold banknotes and credit cards and fit into a pocket or handbag. Small cases for securing banknotes which do not have space for credit cards or identification cards may be classified as money clips: this may also be used to describe small cases designed to hold ISO/IEC 7810 cards alone.
;Breast wallet: Also called a &quot;secretary wallet&quot;, this is a wallet in which banknotes are not folded. They are intended for men&#x27;s breast pocket in a jacket, or for a handbag. Breast wallets will often hold cheques and other monetary documents as they are too large for storage in a pants pocket.
;Bi-fold wallet: a type of wallet in which the banknotes are folded over once. Credit cards and identification cards may be stored horizontally or vertically.
;Tri-fold wallet: a wallet with two folds, in which credit cards are generally stored vertically.
;Front pocket wallet: a case with no currency compartment and very few pockets for cards. Usually banknotes are folded and held in a wallet compartment.
;Money clip wallet: similar to a front pocket wallet in terms of size, with banknotes usually held in by a clip secured by a strong magnet.
;Long wallet: a larger wallet typically worn with jeans, fastened by a chain, strap, or leather band. Bills are held flat, and long wallets typically have a coin purse. Popularized by bikers to secure their wallets while riding a motorcycle, smaller chained wallets became popular in 1970s−&#x27;80s punk fashion and in the early 1990s with the grunge fashion movement as well as heavy metal fashion. Long wallets are popular with men in cash-based countries like Japan and may reflect Native American aesthetic influence.
;Wallet band: a type of wallet that uses a continuous elastic band, made of fabric or rubber, to secure cards and/or cash. Wallet bands reduce the bulk of a traditional wallet.
;Wristlet: a type of wallet that can be secured to the wrist, to keep one&#x27;s hands free.
;Travel wallet: used by travelers to hold essential documentation together, such as passports, tickets, boarding passes, foreign currency, traveler&#x27;s cheques, itinerary, travel insurance, hotel booking information, and other similar items.
;ID case/neck pouch: thin nylon or leather cases with plastic see-through compartments designed to hold an ID card. Usually worn around the neck, many have extra pockets for holding small items, hence they also function as wallets.
;Shoewallet: a small pouch attached to a shoe to be used as a wallet. Designed primarily to be worn during exercise.
;Digital wallet: a computer file for maintaining digital currency.
;Cryptocurrency wallet: a digital wallet where private keys are stored for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
;Hardware wallet: a cryptocurrency wallet built as a separate physical device which identifies the owner, and lets the owner sign online transactions in a secure manner.
;Side by side wallet: divides the contents into two stacks instead of one, so it is half as thick. May be made of very thin fabric. Patented.
;L-Zip wallet: a rectangular shaped wallet with a zipper that runs along 2 sides of the wallet.

==Materials==
The traditional material for wallets is leather or fabric, but many other flexible flat sheet materials can be used in their fabrication. Non-woven textiles such as Tyvek are used, sometimes including reuse of waterproof maps printed on that material. Woven metals, such as fine mesh made of copper or stainless steel have been incorporated into wallets that are promoted as having electromagnetic shielding properties to protect against unauthorized scanning of embedded NFC and RFID tags. Do-it-yourself websites such as Instructables feature many projects for making wallets out of materials such as denim, Kevlar, or duct tape.

==Regional differences==
Some wallets, particularly in Europe where larger value coins are prevalent, contain a coin purse compartment. Some wallets have built-in clasps or bands to keep them closed. As European banknotes, such as euros and pounds, are typically larger than American banknotes in size, they do not fit in some smaller American wallets.

==Metaphorical usage==
The term wallet is also used as a synecdoche to refer to an individual&#x27;s overall personal budget. One of the definitions of &quot;syndecdoche&quot;, by Sasse, uses a wallet reference as an example of the meaning of the term (&quot;an abbreviated speech in which the containing vessel is mentioned instead of its contents&quot;), such as when a person holds up their wallet to a person asking for money, while saying &quot;here is $100&quot;. A wallet is also used as an example in a definition for the related rhetorical device of metonymy: &quot;If we cannot strike offenders in the heart, let us strike them in the wallet.&quot;

<doc id="653175" wikidata="Q1124745" url="?curid=653175" title="Conesus Lake">
<text>Conesus Lake is located in Livingston County, New York. Conesus Lake is the westernmost of New York&#x27;s eleven Finger Lakes. It is located off Interstate 390 about south of Interstate 90.

==Description==

Conesus Lake is long, with a maximum depth of . It flows south to north, from its inlet in the Town of Conesus to its outlet, Conesus Creek, in Lakeville, a hamlet in the Town of Livonia in Livingston County. Conesus Creek in turn flows into the Genesee River near Avon.

The first steamboat on Conesus Lake was named the &quot;Jessie&quot; launched July 1, 1874, after the Civil War.

In August 2006, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation confirmed that the lake was the first outside the contiguous Great Lakes waterways to be stricken with a new strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), an infectious fish disease responsible for mass die-offs of many species, but not linked to any human health concerns. The disease is spread between waterways through live or frozen bait fish, roe, contaminated fishing equipment or live water wells in boats.

==Recreation==
On July 3 of each year, the residents of the lake participate in a tradition called the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, sponsored by the Conesus Lake Association. Participants light road flares around the lake and shoot off fireworks. The festivities typically start at dusk, with approximately 10,000 flares lit at 10:00 PM.

When frozen over in the winter, Conesus Lake is used for snowmobiling and ice fishing.

===Fishing===

Fish species present in the lake include walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and tiger muskie. To access there is state owned hard surface ramp off East Lake Road, a state owned hand launch access on Pebble Beach Road in the hamlet of Lakeville, a state owned hand launch access on US-20A in the hamlet of Lakeville, or at a car top launch access on the south shore off NY-256.

<doc id="653178" wikidata="Q1500327" url="?curid=653178" title="Icarians">
<text>The Icarians were a French-based utopian socialist movement, established by the followers of politician, journalist, and author Étienne Cabet. In an attempt to put his economic and social theories into practice, Cabet led his followers to the United States of America in 1848, where the Icarians established a series of egalitarian communes in the states of Texas, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and California. The movement split several times due to factional disagreements.

The last community of Icarians, located a few miles outside Corning, Iowa, disbanded voluntarily in 1898. The 46 years of tenure at this location made the Corning Icarian Colony one of the longest-lived non-religious communal living experiments in US history.

==History==
=== Cabet as radical French politician ===
Étienne Cabet was born in Dijon, France in 1788 to a middle-class family of artisans. Cabet attended a Roman Catholic secondary school and continued his education, ultimately earning a Doctorate of Law degree in 1812. Cabet was not inclined towards jurisprudence, however, preferring the rough and tumble of politics and journalism. Following the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815, Cabet became active in the struggle against conservative theocratic monarchism, participating in political groups which espoused a constitutional and republican form of government under monarchical leadership.

In 1820 Cabet moved to Paris, the political center of the French nation. There he continued to participate in secret revolutionary societies, at considerable personal risk. It ultimately took a decade for this underground political effort to bear fruit when in July 1830 revolution erupted seeking the fundamental change of the conservative regime which had gained power in the Bourbon Restoration following the fall of Napoleon.

This Revolution of 1830 in a matter of a few frenzied days forced the abdication of the conservative monarch Charles X and returned constitutional government to France. Cabet played a leading role in the revolution as a leading member of the so-called &quot;Insurrection Committee,&quot; activity for which he was recognized with appointment as Attorney-General for Corsica following the coronation of Louis Philippe as king.

Historian Morris Hillquit has argued that the posting of Cabet to Corsica was a calculated &quot;shrewd move on the part of the government&quot; to remove a prominent radical critic from the political hothouse of Paris &quot;under the guise of a reward for his services during the revolution.&quot; Be that as it may, despite his employment as a government functionary in Corsica, Cabet moved into criticism of the new Orléanist regime for its conservatism and half-measures with respect to constitutional rule and the democratic rights of the people. This brought about Cabet&#x27;s prompt removal from office by the new regime in Paris, at whose pleasure Cabet served.
Following his dismissal as Corsican Attorney-General, Cabet turned his hand to writing, authoring a four-volume history of the French Revolution. He also remained active in politics and was elected as a deputy to the lower chamber of the National Assembly in 1834. Cabet emerged as a fierce opponent of the new conservative regime and a potential revolutionary leader, drawing the attention of the regime and its repressive mechanism. In an effort to eliminate the dangerous democratic agitator, Cabet was given the choice of two years&#x27; imprisonment or five years in foreign exile. He decided upon the latter punishment and immediately went into exile in England.

During his five years of English exile, Cabet dedicated himself to philosophical and economic study, carefully considering the relationship between political structures and economic welfare throughout history. Cabet&#x27;s findings were later summarized thus by one of his acolytes:

Cabet turned to the idea of reorganization of society on a communal basis — known as &quot;Communism&quot; in the terminology of the day. His ideas for the modification of society closely paralleled those of a man he met in English exile, Robert Owen.

===&quot;Voyage en Icarie&quot;===
In 1839, his five years&#x27; exile in England complete, Cabet returned to France. He soon began writing a book to expound his economic and social ideas. Following the example of Thomas More in using the form of an allegorical novel allowed not only the exposition of his ideal form of administration but an opportunity for cloaked criticism of the existing regime.

The result of Cabet&#x27;s writing was &quot;Voyage et aventures de Lord William Carisdall en Icarie&quot; (Voyage and Adventures of Lord William Carisdall in Icaria), published in a special edition for friends in 1839, and a general public edition in 1840. A new edition in 1842 shortened the title to &quot;Voyage en Icarie&quot;. 

Cabet serialized a rough English translation in Icarian periodicals of the 1850s. Academic specialist Robert P. Sutton, professor of history at Western Illinois University, made a translation into English that has been deposited with the Library of Congress, although it remains unpublished. In 2003, Syracuse University Press published a translation by , &quot;Travels in Icaria&quot;.

A basic plot outline was published by Morris Hillquit in 1903:

Although regarded today as a &quot;plodding melodrama&quot; in which the reader was inundated with &quot;tedious details of incidental aspects of Icarian life,&quot; Cabet&#x27;s book was well received by readers of his day, with the principles it outlined viewed by many as a blueprint for advancement from a disappointing present to a glorious future. Multiple editions of the book followed in quick succession and with public interest awakened Cabet quickly made the transition from author to builder of a practical movement to advance the communal ideas which he had expounded. In March 1841 Cabet launched a monthly magazine, &quot;Le Populaire,&quot; as well as an annual &quot;Icarian Almanac&quot; to help propagandize and organize the new political movement&#x27;s supporters.

So-called &quot;Icarianism&quot; attracted numerous supporters in such French cities as Reims, Leon, Nantes, Toulouse, and Toulon, with Cabet claiming the existence of 50,000 adherents of his ideas by the end of 1843. These supporters began to see Cabet as a political messiah and sought to implement the leader&#x27;s ideas in a practical setting. It was gradually decided in this period that France did not present a favorable economic, political, or social environment for the implementation of the Icarian ideas; instead, the United States of America was chosen as a more fitting site for colonization – a nation with vast expanses of relatively inexpensive land and a democratic political tradition.

In May 1847, Cabet&#x27;s organ &quot;Le Populaire&quot; carried a lengthy article entitled &quot;Allons en Icarie&quot; (Let Us Go to Icaria), detailing the proposal to establish an American colony based upon the Icarian political and economic ideals and calling for those committed to building an artisanal and agrarian community to volunteer. The wheels were thus set in motion for the formation of what was intended to be a prosperous and enviable collective entity.

===Colonization begins===
Cabet believed that at least 10,000 or 20,000 working men would immediately enlist in the American colonization scheme, with the number soon swelling to a million skilled workers and artisans. Towns and huge cities bursting with industry would shortly follow, with accompanying schools and cultural facilities assuring the good life for a happy and fulfilled community. Announcement of the plan was met with enthusiasm, and offers of participation along with gifts of money, seeds, farm implements, clothing, books, and other valuable and useful items began to flow in.

Cabet gave himself the task of choosing a precise location for colonization. Cabet turned to his friend Robert Owen for advice, traveling to London in September 1847 to consult with his British co-thinker. Owen recommended colonization in the new American state of Texas, a location reckoned to possess vast tracts of unoccupied land which would be as inexpensive as it was plentiful. Cabet made contact with a Texas land agent, The Peters Company, which agreed to present to Owen title for one million acres of land so long as it was colonized by July 1, 1848.

== Icarian settlements ==
===Denton County, Texas===
On February 3, 1848 a so-called &quot;advance guard&quot; of 69 Icarians departed from Le Havre, France for a new life in Texas, leaving aboard the sailing ship &quot;Rome.&quot; These were to proceed to the port of New Orleans and to make their way from there to the designated area in Texas, which was represented as being in close proximity to the Red River. The advance guard arrived in America on March 27, 1848.

They were quick to discover that they had been deceived and that the actual lands designated for colonization were fully 25 miles away from the Red River; moreover, colony lands were not contiguous, but rather were separated into a checkerboard fashion, alternating state and private lands, making integrated communal life not possible. Moreover, instead of the promised 1 million acres, actual contractual terms of the land distribution provided for the distribution of 320 acres of land to 3,125 individuals or families who each had to construct a log cabin and occupy their allotment by the deadline date of July 1, 1848. With only 69 hands available for the construction, there was little hope for construction of more than about 30 cabins by the deadline. The promised 1 million acres was thereby transformed into perhaps 10,000. By 1849, only 281 Icarians stayed loyal to Cabet and remained to rebuild, whereas the rest went back to France.

The party could only proceed by boat to Shreveport. A wagon was obtained and loaded it with provisions for a difficult overland trek via the Bonham Trail to a resting place halfway to the final destination. The first group of 25 men departed on April 8, followed in a second wagon by 14 others shortly thereafter. Both wagons broke down en route and the 39 Icarians were forced to proceed in small groups, packing what they could on their backs. It was not until April 21 that they arrived at their resting place, still more than a hundred difficult miles from their goal.

Only 27 intrepid French settlers were able to make the final leg of the trip from the farm designated as a resting place to their new Texan utopia, a site located in today&#x27;s Denton County in Texas (northwest of Dallas). The small group arrived June 2, 1848, and immediately began a frenzied effort to construct dwellings in order to stake their land claims, attempting at the same time to plow and farm the prairie. Virtually no time remained to meet the terms of the land concession. The hot summer sun began to bake the ground. Poorly fed, poorly housed, overworked and exhausted, the Icarian colonists next fell victim to an outbreaks of cholera and malaria, illnesses which killed four and sickened the rest. Making a bad situation still worse, the one medical doctor in the company broke down into a state of insanity and deserted his fellows.

Back home in France, the Revolution of 1848 had long been in full swing and King Louis Philippe overthrown. The necessity of emigration to achieve democratic reforms seemed less compelling and the volunteers for Icarian colonization in America melted away. Some 1500 settlers were planned for the next wave of settlers; only 19 made the trip, of whom barely more than half ever made it to Texas to join the beleaguered &quot;advance guard&quot; in their Sisyphean task.

The grim reality of their situation now clear, the Texas colonization venture was written off as a total loss by the participants and the survivors divided into small groups to make their way back to Shreveport and from there to New Orleans. Four more died en route. Finally arriving in New Orleans late in 1848, the Texas pioneers were met by several hundred colonization enthusiasts from France, who had been slowly congregating in that city. Their mood was grim.

News of the Texas catastrophe reached Cabet in France and on December 13, 1848, he set out from Liverpool for America in an attempt to shore up the project. After landing in New York, he shipped out again for New Orleans, disembarking there on January 19, 1849. Cabet found his supporters in disarray, &quot;in the deplorable spirit of a defeated army,&quot; to borrow words from an official history by the group. A portion of the prospective colonists sought to abandon the project and to return to France; others sought to continue the colonization project in a more suitable locale.

On January 21 the colonists held a general meeting to decide their fate. Cabet declared that if a majority sought to return home to France, he would support the decision — although with all the costs absorbed in the previous year such a move would have meant financial disaster for all. A small majority of 280 decided to continue with the colonization project if a more suitable locale was found; 200 sought to return. A formal split of the Icarians along these lines immediately followed, the first of three great factional rifts which would split the movement.

An amount of money was pared from the treasury to send the 200 disaffected Icarians home to Le Havre. Once back in France, many of the former Icarian colonists initiated legal proceedings against Cabet for fraud – charges which he was ultimately forced home to answer.

The majority, consisting of about 280 people, joined Cabet in setting out for the Mississippi River town of Nauvoo, located in Hancock County, Illinois, where the Icarian experiment finally began in earnest.

===Nauvoo, Illinois===

Nauvoo was founded in 1839 for the gathering of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Even though Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was killed in 1844, by 1845 Nauvoo had grown to a community of about 15,000 people – dwarfing the city of Chicago, which had only about 8,000 inhabitants at that time. Under threat of continuing violence from the surrounding communities and following a succession crisis, most of the Latter-day Saints, under Brigham Young left in 1846 for Salt Lake City, Utah, the current headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Latter-day Saints later sold their land to the Icarians in 1849.

Nauvoo would become the first permanent Icarian Community, the Icarians immediately adopting the charter and structure described in Cabet&#x27;s &quot;Voyage en Icarie&quot;. The structure included an annually elected president and one officer each to administer finance, farming, industry, and education. New members were admitted by a majority approval vote by the adult males, after living in the commune for four months, forfeiting all personal property, and pledging $80. Nonetheless, visitors were welcome to stay as long as they wished in a hotel.

Every family used the same amount of space (two rooms in an apartment building), and were allowed the same amount of furniture. After the age of four, children lived apart from their parents at a boarding school, and visited families only on Sundays. This was intended to foster a love for the community &quot;without developing special affection for parents&quot; from a young age, theoretically instrumental to the smooth working of a Utopian society. Sundays were not what would be a typical religious Sunday. The Icarians practiced no religion, but there were days people voluntarily gathered in a fellowship called &quot;Cours icarien&quot; to discuss Cabet&#x27;s writings and Christian morals and ethics.

Because long-term celibacy was viewed askance by the community, marriage was the norm. Divorce was acceptable under the assumption individuals would remarry soon.

With the basic need of shelter immediately settled, a short period of energetic growth and relative prosperity followed. Farmland was rented, a saw mill and flour mill opened, workshops established, and schools and a theater founded. A periodical press was launched, publishing in French, English, and German, and an office was established in Paris to recruit adherents for the American colony. The Nauvoo cultural life thrived. The Icarians held regular band concerts and theatre productions. Their library consisted of an extensive collection, ranging from reference works to applied science to popular novels, all in English and French, and totaling over 4,000 volumes. By 1855 there would be more than 500 participants in the Icarian project.

Political disagreements and personal animosities would lead to the second major split of the Icarians in America. Étienne Cabet began in America in 1849 with the authority of the sect&#x27;s unquestioned leader, status which was freely granted to him by those inspired to action by the man&#x27;s writings. This individual status as supreme decision-maker stood in marked contradiction to the democratic ideals of the community, however. Cabet himself realized as much and in 1850 he proposed a constitution which provided for an elected president and board of directors, which would supplant the absolute, personal authority of the unitary leader. This system functioned effectively for a time.

In 1852, a lawsuit was filed in Paris against Cabet by a number of dissident former Icarians, who claimed their property was obtained by him by means of fraud. Cabet returned to France for 18 months to fight these charges. When he returned to America, he began to push through a series of restrictive rules, including the prohibition of talking in workshops, banning the use of tobacco and alcohol, and other regulations which were unpopular with some members of the community. He also moved to reestablish his own personal decision-making authority over the entire community, proposing in December 1855 to revise the constitution to provide for a powerful president elected to a four-year term. This president, under Cabet&#x27;s new scheme, would have the ability to control all aspects of the community&#x27;s government.

This position by Cabet was anathema to a majority of the Icarian cooperators, who were deeply inspired and influenced by the history and traditions of the Great French Revolution and its democratic ideals. Cabet&#x27;s position was deeply held by him as essential to the preservation of the community&#x27;s moral fiber, however, and in his position he was staunchly supported by &quot;a strong minority.&quot;

The factional battle continued for a year between the Dissidents (led by Alexis Armel Marchand and Jean Baptist Gerard) and the Cabetists, finally resolving itself in a formal split. The Cabetists were expelled, and Cabet led about 170 of his followers out of Nauvoo in October 1856, heading downriver to St. Louis to establish a new colony in that vicinity.

Shattered by the loss of about 40% of its members and no longer able to raise financial support in France, the Nauvoo colony of the majority faction ultimately encountered insurmountable financial difficulties and was forced to disband in 1860. Many of the participants of the defunct Nauvoo colony would join the parallel Icarian colony in Iowa.

One legacy still continues in Nauvoo. Emile and Annette Baxter joined the Icarian community in 1855, staying with it through the 1857 breakup. They remained in Nauvoo and founded Baxter&#x27;s Vineyards and Winery. It has been operated by several generations of the family and is Illinois&#x27; oldest winery.

===Cheltenham, Missouri===

The Icarians who had left Nauvoo owing to their support of personal leadership of Cabet and his restrictive behavioral agenda arrived in St. Louis on November 6, 1856. In an ironic twist of fate, the leader for whom they had executed the split of Icaria in Nauvoo, Étienne Cabet, died just two days later. The new leader became a thirty-two-year-old lawyer named Benjamin Mercadier.

On February 15, 1858, a group of 151 Icarians took possession of a few hundred acres in Cheltenham, St. Louis, Missouri. These Cabetists used Cabet&#x27;s money and put down $500 on a $25,000 mortgage for thirty-nine acres and three buildings southwest of this city. Adjusting to a new area and new locals was difficult, but the Icarians adopted a constitution, a replica of the Nauvoo one, worked in the city, and enrolled their children into the local public schools. The colony quickly fell into various arguments. During the Civil War, many young men joined the Union cause. By 1864, only about twenty residents remained on the property. For the rest of the people, epidemics of dysentery and cholera occurred in the warmer months. Because the Icarians could not meet the mortgage payments, in March 1864, Arsène Sauva returned the keys to the property to St. Louis banker Thomas Allen (from whom the property had been purchased in 1858), leaving a large debt. That same year, most members left the community, and the Cheltenham Icaria was no longer extant.

In 1872, the buildings went into a state of disrepair, and in 1875, a fire destroyed the buildings on this property, removing the last evidence of the Icarian colony.

===Corning, Iowa===
In 1852, Icarians purchased land in Adams County, Iowa to form a new permanent settlement, and Icarians began settling southwest of Queen City in 1853. In 1860, when the Nauvoo colony went bankrupt, many members of the community moved to the new site in Iowa. The settlers arrived with nothing but their skills along with $20,000 of debt. Their land was that of where they first found shelter in mud hovels and then in crudely built log cabins. The colony near what became Corning, Iowa was granted a charter of incorporation by the state of Iowa in 1860. The community prospered during the Civil War by selling food at good prices, and they were able to pay their collective debt by 1870.

In the spring of 1874 the Icarian colony near Corning was visited by Charles Nordhoff, who was travelling the United States doing investigative research on such communities in preparation for writing a book. At that time Nordhoff found a two-story building, 60 feet by 24, which served as a collective dining hall, washhouse, and school About a dozen cheaply built frame houses sheltered the colonists, who at the time included about 65 members in 11 families. Most of those in the community were of French ethnicity, and French was the language spoken by the colonists, although among their number were included &quot;one American, one Swiss, a Swede, a Spaniard, and two Germans.&quot;

Nordhoff wrote:

The children look remarkably healthy, and on Sunday were dressed with great taste. The living is still of the plainest. In the common dining-hall they assemble in groups at the tables, which were without a cloth, and they drink out of tin cups, and pour their water from tin cans. &#x27;It is very plain,&#x27; said one to me; &#x27;but we are independent — no man&#x27;s servants — and we are content.&#x27;

Nordhoff noted that the Iowa colony sold to the market about 2,500 pounds of wool annually, as well as cattle and hogs and the product of its manufacturing facilities. The group continued to operate under an elaborate constitution written by Cabet, &quot;which lays down with great care the equality and brotherhood of mankind, and the duty of holding all things in common; abolishes servitude or service (or servants); commands marriage, under penalties; provides for education; and requires that the majority shall rule.&quot;
Governance was based upon weekly meetings of all adults each Saturday, with a President elected annually as formal head of the colony but officers for the conduct of meetings elected each week. In addition to the President there were four elected directors, in charge of agriculture, clothing, industry, and construction, respectively.

Nordhoff noted that the community had no formal religious observances. Instead, &quot;Sunday is a day of rest from labor, when the young men go out with guns, and the society sometimes has theatrical representations, or music, or some kind of amusement. The principle is to let each one do as he pleases.&quot;

In the 1870s, the Icarian colony near Corning had another split. The &quot;&quot;vieux icariens&quot; were against allowing women the right to vote, but the &quot;jeunes icariens&quot;&quot; were in favor. By a vote of 31–17, the community electors voted against the franchise for women. After that, the &quot;jeunes icariens&quot; moved to a new site on the same property about one mile southeast. The move was done by moving eight frame houses from the original colony. The &quot;vieux icariens&quot; community was no longer viable and was forced to disband due to bankruptcy in 1878. The new community established a new constitution in 1879.

In 1898, this last community of Icarians disbanded voluntarily; the members chose to integrate into the surrounding towns. Its 46 years in existence made the Corning Icarian community the longest-lived non-religious communal living experiment in American history until the 21st century.

A historical exhibit about the Icarians can be found in the lobby of the Adams County hall in Corning, and a living history site is being rebuilt on the location of the site where the Icarians lived until 1898.

===Cloverdale, California===
A new colony of &quot;Icaria Speranza&quot; was established by Jules Leroux (brother of French socialist philosopher Pierre Leroux) and Armand Dehay, who in 1881 moved from Jeune Icarie to an area just south of Cloverdale, California. The group bought the 885-acre Bluxome ranch on the Russian River, which included vineyards, orchards, and arable land. Originally named Speranza, after Leroux&#x27;s review &quot;L&#x27;Esperance&quot;, the community gained remaining members of Young Icaria and became Icaria-Speranza.
At its height, the settlement had an estimated population of 55 individuals. This settlement disbanded in 1886. Today there is an historical marker just south of town marking where their schoolhouse was.

== Community structure ==

===Admissions===
A charter created by the Society in 1853 specified that residents of the Nauvoo colony were required to donate all their worldly goods to the community, which had to include a minimum of $60. Those who passed a probationary period of four months would be allowed to move to the permanent colony in Iowa.

===Equality===
The Icarians lived in communal dwellings of dormitories that shared central living and dining areas. All families lived in two equal rooms in an apartment building and had the same kind of furniture. Children were raised in a communal creche, not just by their own parents. Tasks were divided among the group; one might be a seamstress and never need to cook.

===Housing===
When the Icarians first arrived at Nauvoo on March 15, 1849, they purchased a number of buildings, grounds, houses, cattle and the burned-out Mormon Temple which they intended to use as an academy or school.

After all purchases and repairs were done, the Nauvoo Icarian village consisted of a dwelling of individual apartments, two schools (one for girls and the other for boys), two infirmaries, a pharmacy, a large community kitchen with dining hall, a bakery, a butchery, and a room for laundry facilities. Soon thereafter, a steam-powered flour mill, a distillery, pigsty and sawmill were added. A local coal mine was worked for fuel.

===Work===
All work was divided by sex. Men worked as tailors, masons, wheelwrights, shoemakers, mechanics, blacksmiths, carpenters, tanners, and butchers. Women worked as cooks, seamstresses, washerwomen and ironers.

To earn money, the Icarians established commerce with the outside world by a small store outside St. Louis. Here they sold their handmade shoes, boots and dresses, and also sold items made by the mills and distillery.

===Religion===
The Icarians believed in a higher power and had a ten-section principle that briefly stated what they thought was needed in a perfect society.

The religion of choice should have an understanding of the following:
*Evil, Misfortune 
*Intelligence
*Causes of Evil
*God and Perfection
*Destiny of Humanity, Happiness
*Sociability
*Perfectibility
*The Remedy
*God, Father of the Human Race 

At eighteen years of age, the Icarians were instructed on world religions. Marriage in the community was highly encouraged, almost insisted upon. Divorce was allowed; however, members were encouraged to remarry as soon as possible.

Cabet&#x27;s book &quot;Vrai christianisme&quot; (&quot;True Christianity&quot;) was often read from and formed the dominant influence on religious thought, though it was not intended as a specific instruction on religious observances. In the Iowa colony, the Icarians adopted the practice of an informal religious gathering known as the &quot;Cours Icariens&quot; (&quot;Icarian Course&quot;) on Sunday afternoons. In addition to reading from &quot;Vrai christianisme&quot; and other books, these gatherings included quiet games and conversation.

=== Culture ===
Culture in Icaria was the second highest priority, second only to education. The community held several concerts and theatrical productions for the entertainment of its members, performing works such as &quot;The Salamander&quot;, &quot;Death to the Rats&quot;, &quot;Six Heads in a Hat&quot;, or &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

In Nauvoo, there was a library of over 4,000 books, the biggest in Illinois at the time. The community also distributed a biweekly newspaper titled &quot;Colonie Icarienne&quot;.

The most important holidays were February 3, the anniversary of the First Departure of Icarians from France, and July 4, the summer festival. On July 4, the refectory was decorated with garlands and boughs; cardboard signs declared &quot;Equality&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot;, and &quot;Unity&quot;, and banners had quotations like &quot;All for Each; Each for All&quot;, &quot;To Each According to Their Needs&quot;, and &quot;First Right is to Live; First Duty is to Work&quot;. They raised the American flag and played the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;America&quot;. They travelled into Corning to watch the Fourth of July parade, but they remained apart from the anglophone Americans. At the end of the day, they returned to Icaria (three miles east) for a banquet, dance, and theatrical presentation. Icarians also celebrated Christmas, New Year&#x27;s Day, and the &quot;Fete du Mais&quot;, a fall harvest corn festival similar to Thanksgiving.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
Men and women were given equal participation opportunities in weekly community assemblies, voting on admissions, constitutional changes, and the election of the officer in charge of clothing and lodging.

<text>Hemlock Lake is one of the minor Finger Lakes. It is mostly located in Livingston County, New York, south of Rochester, with a portion overlapping into Ontario County. Hemlock is a translation of the Seneca name for the lake, &quot;O-neh-da Te-car-ne-o-di&quot;. It is one of two Finger Lakes whose shorelines are virtually undeveloped.

==Description==
Hemlock Lake is long, and approximately wide along most of its uniform north-south length. It has a surface area of , and maximum and mean depths of and respectively. Because the lake is a water source to Rochester, shore development is restricted and boats can be no longer than 16 feet and outboard motors no larger than 10 horsepower. Swimming is not permitted in the lake.

A feature of the lake is its land-locked salmon. In addition, the lake contains rainbow trout, brown trout, lake trout, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, rock bass, chain pickerel, brown bullhead, yellow perch, walleye, and black crappie.

==History==
The Seneca people used the lake and its surrounding area for hunting and fishing near the south end of the lake up until the late 1770s. In September 1779 General John Sullivan and his army drove the natives away from the lake as part of the Sullivan Expedition.

In the 1790s Hemlock Lake natives were removed from their homeland, and displaced by its first white settlers. Most of these settlers were involved in the lumber industry and built their homes out of wooden slabs by the outlet which is located at the north end of the lake. For a time this place was known as &quot;Slab City&quot;. The lake was used to float logs to Slab City in the summer months as well as to haul logs on the ice in the winter time.

Over the years Hemlock Lake became populated with over one hundred cottages and five hotels. There were five large boats that sailed the lake in the 1800s, including its first steam boat &quot;The Seth Green&quot;. The lake was a popular summer vacation destination for the wealthy, many of whom came from Rochester.

In 1852 the City of Rochester approved the construction of a pipeline after a severe outbreak of illness caused by contaminated city water. In 1876 the gravity-fed pipeline connecting Hemlock Lake to Rochester was opened. To improve water quality, the city purchased the land surrounding both Hemlock Lake and neighboring Canadice Lake; the lakes&#x27; cottages, hotels, and farms were condemned and torn down beginning in 1895. Property owners who refused to sell to the city became the subject of eminent domain. Including the land around Hemlock and Canadice lakes, the city owned over of land, of which were forested.

In 2010 the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) purchased both Hemlock and Canadice Lakes from the City of Rochester for $13.7 million. The State has pledged to keep the lakes forever wild. Public access to the lake is permitted and encouraged, however boats are restricted to in length and to outboard motors must be 10 horse-power or less.

<text>In chemistry, delocalized electrons are electrons in a molecule, ion or solid metal that are not associated with a single atom or a covalent bond.

The term delocalization is general and can have slightly different meanings in different fields:
* In organic chemistry, it refers to resonance in conjugated systems and aromatic compounds. 
* In solid-state physics, it refers to free electrons that facilitate electrical conduction. 
* In quantum chemistry, it refers to molecular orbital electrons that have extended over several adjacent atoms.

== Resonance ==

In the simple aromatic ring of benzene, the delocalization of six π electrons over the C6 ring is often graphically indicated by a circle. The fact that the six C-C bonds are equidistant is one indication that the electrons are delocalized; if the structure were to have isolated double bonds alternating with discrete single bonds, the bond would likewise have alternating longer and shorter lengths. In valence bond theory, delocalization in benzene is represented by resonance structures.

== Electrical conduction ==

Delocalized electrons also exist in the structure of solid metals. Metallic structure consists of aligned positive ions (cations) in a &quot;sea&quot; of delocalized electrons. This means that the electrons are free to move throughout the structure, and gives rise to properties such as conductivity.

In diamond all four outer electrons of each carbon atom are &#x27;localized&#x27; between the atoms in covalent bonding. The movement of electrons is restricted and diamond does not conduct an electric current. In graphite, each carbon atom uses only 3 of its 4 outer energy level electrons in covalently bonding to three other carbon atoms in a plane. Each carbon atom contributes one electron to a delocalized system of electrons that is also a part of the chemical bonding. The delocalized electrons are free to move throughout the plane. For this reason, graphite conducts electricity along the planes of carbon atoms, but does not conduct in a direction at right angles to the plane. 

== Molecular orbitals ==

Standard ab initio quantum chemistry methods lead to delocalized orbitals that, in general, extend over an entire molecule and have the symmetry of the molecule. Localized orbitals may then be found as linear combinations of the delocalized orbitals, given by an appropriate unitary transformation.

In the methane molecule, ab initio calculations show bonding character in four molecular orbitals, sharing the electrons uniformly among all five atoms. There are two orbital levels, a bonding molecular orbital formed from the 2s orbital on carbon and triply degenerate bonding molecular orbitals from each of the 2p orbitals on carbon. The localized sp3 orbitals corresponding to each individual bond in valence bond theory can be obtained from a linear combination of the four molecular orbitals.

<doc id="653194" wikidata="Q2889457" url="?curid=653194" title="Man-at-arms">
<text>A man-at-arms was a soldier of the High Medieval to Renaissance periods who was typically well-versed in the use of arms and served as a fully-armoured heavy cavalryman. A man-at-arms could be a knight, or other nobleman, a member of a knight&#x27;s or nobleman&#x27;s retinue, or a mercenary in a company serving under a captain. Such men could serve for pay or through a feudal obligation. The terms &quot;knight&quot; and &quot;man-at-arms&quot; are often used interchangeably, but while all knights equipped for war were men-at-arms, not all men-at-arms were knights.

== Terminology ==

Though in English the term man-at-arms is a fairly straightforward rendering of the French &quot;homme d&#x27;armes&quot;, in the Middle Ages, there were numerous terms for this type of soldier, referring to the type of arms he would be expected to provide: In France, he might be known as a &quot;lance&quot; or &quot;glaive&quot;, while in Germany, &quot;Spieß&quot;, &quot;Helm&quot; or &quot;Gleve&quot;, and in various places, a &quot;bascinet&quot;. In Italy, the term &quot;barbuta&quot; was used, and in England from the late 14th century, men-at-arms were known as &quot;lances&quot; or &quot;spears&quot;.

In the Early Medieval period, any well-equipped horseman could be described as a &quot;knight&quot;, or in Latin, &quot;miles&quot;. In the course of the 12th century knighthood became a social rank with a distinction being made between &quot;milites gregarii&quot; (non-noble cavalrymen) and &quot;milites nobiles&quot; (true knights). As a fully armoured cavalryman could be of a lesser social status than a knight, an alternative term describing this type of soldier came into use which was, in French, &quot;homme d&#x27;armes&quot; or &quot;gent d&#x27;armes&quot;, and in English man-at-arms. This evolution differed in detail and timeline across Europe but by 1300, there was a clear distinction between the military function of the man-at-arms and the social rank of knighthood. The term man-at-arms thus primarily denoted a military function, rather than a social rank.

== Military function ==

The military function that a man-at-arms performed was serving as a fully-armoured heavy cavalryman; though he could, and in the 14th and 15th centuries often did, also fight on foot. In the course of the 16th century, the man-at-arms was gradually replaced by other cavalry types, the demi-lancer and the cuirassier, characterised by less-extensive armour coverage and the use of weapons other than the heavy lance.

=== Arms and armour ===

Throughout the medieval period and into the Renaissance the armour of the man-at-arms became progressively more effective and expensive. Throughout the 14th century, the armour worn by a man-at-arms was a composite of materials. Over a quilted gambeson, mail armour covered the body, limbs and head. Increasingly during the century, the mail was supplemented by plate armour on the body and limbs. In the 15th century, full plate armour was developed, which reduced the mail component to a few points of flexible reinforcement.

From the 14th to 16th century, the primary weapon of the man at arms on horseback was the lance. The lance of the 14th century was essentially a simple spear, in length, usually of ash. In response to the development of improved armour, however, heavier lances weighing up to were developed, combined with a new method of using them in conjunction with a lance rest (&quot;arrêt&quot;) fixed to the breastplate. This combination of heavy lance and &quot;arrêt&quot; enabled the mounted man-at-arms to enjoy a new effectiveness on the battlefields of the later 15th and 16th centuries. Not all men-at-arms in the 15th century carried the heavy lance. A lighter weapon called a demi-lance evolved and this gave its name to a new class of a lighter-equipped man-at-arms, the demi-lancer, towards the end of the 15th century.

When fighting on foot, men-at-arms initially modified their ordinary cavalry weapons. English men-at-arms in Italy in the 1360s are recorded as advancing in close order with two men holding a cavalry lance. On other occasions, such as at the Battle of Agincourt, men-at-arms cut down their lances to a more manageable size of . In the 15th century, the increased protection of plate armour led to the development of a specialist foot combat weapon, the two-handed poleaxe.

=== Horses ===
The horse was an essential part of a man-at-arm&#x27;s equipment. The type of horse, however, varied according to wealth and status. Andrew Ayton in an in-depth study of English warhorses of the 13th and 14th centuries has shown that three types predominate: the destrier, the courser and an animal simply known as a &quot;horse&quot; (&quot;L:equus Med Fr : chival&quot;). Destriers were both rare and expensive, making up 5% of men-at-arms horses. Ayton also calculated the value of the average man-at-arm&#x27;s horse in thirteen campaigns between 1282 and 1364, showing it varied between £7.6 and £16.4. In only two campaigns in the mid-14th century did the majority of horses cost more than £10. The horse was, therefore, a major item of expenditure in the equipment of a man-at-arms. It has been calculated that a French gendarme&#x27;s horse in the mid-15th century cost the equivalent of six months&#x27; wages.
The cost of horses meant that the professional soldier might not wish to risk his expensive asset in combat. A system evolved in the 13th century for employers to compensate for horses lost in action. In England this was called by the Latin name &quot;restauro equorum&quot; and similar systems were in use in France and Italy. In order to secure this insurance scheme, the man-at-arms had the value of his horse assessed and details of its appearance recorded. The assessment system also allowed employers to insist on a minimum value (and hence quality) of horse be presented at muster. In 14th-century England, the minimum value appears in most cases to be 100 shillings (£5).

==== Horse armour ====

As early as the late 13th century, Edward I decreed that all his men-at-arms should be mounted on &quot;equus coopertus&quot;, that is armoured, or barded, horses. Horse armour was not at that time always made of metal, with leather and quilted fabric armour also in use. Metal horse armours were made from mail or brigandine, with plate reserved for the head in the form of a &quot;chamfron&quot;. In the 15th century, plate armour for horses was introduced and was a common feature of the equipment of the gendarme into the 16th century.

== In England ==

=== Social status ===

The social structure of the Anglo-Norman society of England was relatively rigid. One of the easiest ways for a man to improve his social rank was through military service; another method was through the church. In the Norman states, unlike in many other contemporary societies, the knighting of men of common birth who had demonstrated ability and courage on the field of battle was possible. Although rare, some non-knightly men-at-arms did advance socially to the status of knights. The knighting of squires and men-at-arms was sometimes done in an ignoble manner, simply to increase the number of knights within an army (such practice was common during the Hundred Years&#x27; War). In chivalric theory, any knight could bestow knighthood on another, however, in practice this was usually done by sovereigns and the higher nobility. It is recorded that the great mercenary captain Sir John Hawkwood knighted a number of his followers, as many as twenty on one occasion, though he could reasonably be expected to provide the income his created knights required to maintain their new status. Attempts to restrict the power of commanders to make knights would increase during the 16th century and by the end of Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign, the practice had all but ceased.

Although a knight bachelor, a knight banneret and all grades of nobility usually served as men-at-arms when called to war, the bulk of men-at-arms from the later 13th century came from an evolving social group which became known as the gentry. The man-at-arms could be a wealthy mercenary of any social origin, but more often he had some level of social rank based on income, usually from land. Some came from the class known as serjeants but increasingly during the 14th century they were drawn from an evolving class of esquire. Esquires were frequently of families of knightly rank, wealthy enough to afford the arms of a knight but who had thus far not been advanced to knightly status or perhaps had avoided it because they did not want the costs and responsibilities of that rank. Also found serving as men-at-arms were the lowest social group of the gentry, known by the 15th century simply as gentlemen.

The proportion of knights among the men-at-arms varied through time. Between the 1280s and 1360s, figures between 20 and 30% were commonplace. Thereafter, there was a rapid decline, with the figure dropping to 6.5% in 1380. A slight rise is recorded to 8% at Agincourt, perhaps because this was a royal army, but thereafter the figure continued to decline and by 1443, the Duke of Somerset mustered only 1.3% knights among his men-at-arms.

=== Conditions of service ===

Social status affected the types of military service performed by men-at-arms. Garrison duty was considered unattractive and was often carried out by soldiers of lesser status. For example, the English garrison in the Scottish town of Roxburgh in 1301 consisted of just three knights compared to twenty seven men-at-arms of lesser status.

The social stratification of men who served as men-at-arms is illustrated by their rates of pay on campaign. In the mid 1340s a knight was paid two shillings a day, an ordinary man-at-arms was paid half this amount; for comparison a foot archer received two or three pence (12 pennies to the shilling). A man-at-arms was also recompensed differentially according to the quality of his principal war-horse, if the horse was to die or was killed in battle. An ordinary esquire might own a war-horse worth only five pounds whilst a great nobleman might own a horse worth up to 100 pounds.

=== Military role ===

English men-at-arms before the second quarter of the 14th century were indistinguishable from their continental counterparts, serving as heavy cavalry on the field of battle. The Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332, against the Scots, signalled a major change in the battlefield role of the English man-at-arms. This battle was the first major encounter where the tactical combination of dismounted men-at-arms with longbow-armed archers was deployed; the men-at-arms functioning as heavy close-combat infantry. This combination was later employed very effectively against the French in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The English man-at-arms remained highly trained in mounted combat, though his use of the warhorse became largely confined to the pursuit of a broken enemy, skirmishing and in the &quot;chevauchée&quot;. In the late 15th century a resurgence in the effectiveness of the heavy lancer in combat took place in Europe. This was reflected to some extent in England, exemplified by Richard III&#x27;s mounted charge at the Battle of Bosworth (1485) and the English cavalry charge at the Battle of the Spurs (1513).

The last major battle in which English men-at-arms were prominent was fought against a Scottish army in 1547 at Pinkie Cleugh. The outnumbered Scots cavalry were easily driven off by the English horse (the Scots cavalry having lost heavily in an engagement the day before), the Scots then made a sudden advance with their massed pikemen. To slow their onset and give time for the English infantry to receive them the English heavy horse (men-at-arms and demi-lancers) were thrown against the pikes. The English cavalry crashed into the pikemen with great elan but sustained considerable losses. However, they halted the Scots attack, buying time for the English infantry and artillery to deploy effectively; the battle resulted in a heavy defeat for the Scots.

French men-at-arms were, as elsewhere, drawn from the broad class of &quot;gentil hommes&quot;. Up to the middle of the 14th century, they attended the royal army either in company of their feudal lords or as individuals. In 1351, the first in a series of &quot;ordonnances&quot; was proclaimed, attempting to regularise the organisation of men-at-arms into units of 25 to 80 combatants. New &quot;ordonnances&quot; were issued occasionally to either reinforce or reform previous ones. The &quot;ordonnance&quot; of 1363 attempted to create a standing army of 6,000 men-at-arms, although it might not have achieved more than 3,000 in reality. In 1445, a more radical overhaul was attempted. 15 companies of the ordonnance were created, each of 100 lances. Each lance contained a man-at-arms, a coustillier, three mounted archers and a page. In 1446, the scheme was extended to add another five companies, giving a total of 2,000 men-at-arms. Eventually, the number of these &quot;gens d&#x27;ordonnance du roi&quot; raised by Louis XI would reach 15,816 men, including 2,636 men-at-arms.

=== The 16th century ===

The number of men-at-arms would continue to fluctuate, dependent on military circumstances, into the 16th century. In the first quarter of the century, they varied between a peacetime minimum of 1500 lances in 1505 and a wartime maximum of 3847 in 1523. The changes were made both by raising and disbanding whole companies and by varying the number of men in &quot;ordonnance&quot; companies. In 1559, for example, Francis II reduced the number of lances in each company by 20.

By the 1580s the traditional French gendarme, as a lance-armed heavily armoured cavalryman, was in sharp decline. The Battle of Coutras (October 20, 1587), between Henry of Navarre, and the Duc de Joyeuse, during the French Wars of Religion, illustrates the demise of the heavy lancer. Navarre&#x27;s cavalry were 1,300 armoured pistoleers whilst the Royalists under Joyeuse were 2,000 heavy lancers (gendarmes). Within a few minutes of combat the lancers had been routed, many being captured and held for ransom. All later French cavalry named &#x27;gendarmes&#x27; were more lightly armoured, eventually becoming unarmoured, and employed firearms and a sword, rather than the heavy lance.

=== Later history ===

Louis XIV on his accession to the throne found only eight companies of gendarmes surviving out of an original total of more than one hundred, but after the victory of Fleurus (1690), which had been decided by their courage, he increased their number to sixteen. The four first companies were designated by the names of &quot;Gendarmes ecossais&quot;, &quot;Gendarmes anglais&quot;, &quot;Gendarmes bourguignons&quot; and &quot;Gendarmes flamands&quot;, from the nationality of the soldiers who had originally composed them, but at that time they consisted entirely of French soldiers and officers. These four companies had a captain-general, who was the king. The fifth company was that of the queen and the others bore the name of the princes who respectively commanded them. This organisation was dissolved in 1788.

=== Evolution into a paramilitary police force ===

A military corps having such duties was first created in 1337 and was placed under the orders of the Constable of France (&quot;connétable&quot;), and therefore named &quot;connétablie&quot;. In 1626 after the abolition of the title of connétable, it was put under the command of the &quot;Maréchal of France&quot;, and renamed &quot;Maréchaussée&quot;. Its main mission was protecting the roads from highwaymen. In 1720 the &quot;maréchaussée&quot; was subordinated to the gendarmerie; after the French Revolution the &quot;maréchaussée&quot; was abolished and the gendarmerie took over its duties in 1791.

== In Spain ==


Spain had multiple factors contributing to the strong chivalric ethos exemplified by Spanish knights and men-at-arms. One factor leading to the prominence of chivalric orders in Spain, is the Reconquista in which Christian kingdoms attempted to regain land from, and eventually expel from the peninsula, the Muslim states. The greatest foes of the Spanish Christian knight were, above all, Muslims; who were a local and deeply entrenched enemy, not as distant as the &#x27;infidel&#x27; was for the knights of other European regions. However, warfare between the Christian states of the Iberian Peninsula was also not uncommon. It can be argued that in Spain the existence of a common enemy had some role in uniting Christian kingdoms in the cause of the Crusades and Reconquista.

In the 12th–13th century most of the prominent Spanish Knightly orders were formed. The early history of chivalric orders in the peninsula was unstable. In Calatrava, during the middle of the 12th century Castilian Knights established a fortress, which would later be abandoned due to the threat of Muslim attack, then again within fifty years the castle of the Order of Calatrava was then rebuilt and became a fortified monastic community.

In the Italian Wars the Spanish man-at-arms was prominent in the campaigns. One example is at the Battle of Cerignola, which began with two charges by the French heavy cavalry against the center of the Spanish army, but these were scattered by Spanish heavy artillery and arquebus fire. The next assault tried to force the right flank, but many of the French cavalrymen fell into the Spanish trench and the attack was then broken by a storm of fire from the Spanish arquebusiers.

The Spanish leader Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba then called for a counterattack against the now disorganized enemy by both the Spanish infantry and the heavy Spanish cavalry waiting in reserve. Mounted arquebusiers surrounded and routed the remaining French gendarmes, but the Swiss pikeman managed to retreat in a relatively organized fashion.

== In Italy ==
Men-at-arms formed the core troops of the Italian &quot;condottiere&quot; companies from the 14th to the 16th century. Although the man-at-arms always remained essentially a mounted soldier, in the 14th century, they often fought on foot, following the example of English mercenaries who, from the second half of the century, commonly fought there. The system of &quot;condotte&quot; or contracts which gave the condottieri their name led to the construction of armies from a number of contract holders, usually grouped under a main contractor. Perhaps the best known of these is the White Company led by Sir John Hawkwood in the 14th century. Organisation of these companies was in &quot;lanze&quot; of three men, initially two fighting men and a page but later a man-at-arms, an armed servant (&quot;piatto&quot;) and a page (&quot;ragazzo&quot;). 5 &quot;lanze&quot; were grouped to form a &quot;posta&quot; and five of these made a &quot;bandiera&quot;.

In the 15th century, the structure of the companies changed. A company would be organised into a number of squadrons. One of these would be the household squadron of the captain, known as the &quot;casa&quot;, which contained both fighting troops and headquarters staff, such as a marshal, chaplain, chancellors, cooks and servants. The size of squadrons varied but would contain about 25 &quot;lanze&quot;.

In the second half of the century, these structures began to be supplemented by the practice of states hiring alongside companies individual men-at-arms, who were then grouped under a commander appointed by the state. These were originally recruited from men-at-arms whose company commander had died or retired and so were known as &quot;lanze spezzate&quot; or broken lances. At the same time, changes were seen in the components of the &quot;lanze&quot;, with the introduction of the &quot;corazzo&quot;, a larger unit but still containing just one man-at-arms, and the recognition of two types of men-at-arms in &quot;condotte&quot;; true men-at-arms known as &quot;armigeri veri&quot; and lighter-equipped &quot;elmetti&quot;. Towards the end of the 15th century, squadrons of men-at-arms begin to be organised into larger formations known as columns led by a senior &quot;condottiero&quot; called a colonello. A column typically contained eight to ten squadrons.

<text>The Economic Cooperation Organization or ECO is a Eurasian political and economic intergovernmental organization that was founded in 1985 in Tehran by the leaders of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey. It provides a platform to discuss ways to improve development and promote trade and investment opportunities. The ECO is an &quot;ad hoc&quot; organisation under the United Nations Charter. The objective is to establish a single market for goods and services, much like the European Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the ECO expanded to include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in 1992.

The current framework of the ECO expresses itself mostly in the form of bilateral agreements and arbitration mechanisms between individual and fully sovereign member states. That makes the ECO similar to ASEAN in that it is an organisation that has its own offices and bureaucracy for implementation of trade amongst sovereign member states. This consists of the historically integrated agricultural region of the Ferghana Valley which allows for trade and common agricultural production in the border region between Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Pakistan has free trade agreements with both Afghanistan and Iran which are in the process of implementation.

In 2017, a free trade agreement between Turkey and Iran was proposed to be signed in the future, in addition to a proposed Pakistan-Turkey Free Trade Agreement. The Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement is designed to facilitate trade for goods and services for Central Asia via both Afghanistan and Pakistan. That is in addition to the Ashgabat agreement, which is a multi-modal transport agreement between the Central Asian states. Further cooperation amongst members is planned in the form of the Iran–Pakistan gas pipeline, as well as a Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan pipeline. Current pipelines include the Tabriz–Ankara pipeline in addition to the planned Persian Pipeline. This is in addition to the transportation of oil and gas from Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to supply the industrialisation underway in Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and beyond. Pakistan plans to diversify its source of oil and gas supplies towards the Central Asian states, including petroleum import contracts with Azerbaijan.

The ECO&#x27;s Secretariat and ECO Cultural Institute are based in Iran, ECO Trade and Development Bank and ECO Educational Institute are located in Turkey, and ECO Science Foundation is in Pakistan.

== History ==
The Economic Cooperation Organization was the successor organisation of what was the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD), founded in 1964, which ended activities in 1979. In 1985 Iran, Pakistan and Turkey joined to form the ECO. By the fall of 1992, the ECO expanded to include seven new members; Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The date of the expansion to its present strength, 28 November, is referred to as &quot;ECO Day&quot;. The status and power of the ECO is growing. However, the organisation faces many challenges. Most importantly, the member states are lacking appropriate infrastructure and institutions which the Organization is primarily seeking to develop, to make full use of the available resources in the region and provide sustainable development for the member nations. The Economic Cooperation Organisation Trade Agreement (ECOTA) was signed on 17 July 2003 in Islamabad. ECO Trade Promotion Organization (TPO) is a new organization for trade promotion among member states located in Iran (2009). Under the agreement reached between ECO members, the common trade market should be established by 2015.

<text>Canada Steamship Lines (CSL) is a shipping company with headquarters in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The business has been operating for well over a century and a half.

==Beginnings==
CSL had humble beginnings in Canada East in 1845, operating river boats on the Saint Lawrence River in general commerce. The Richelieu Navigation Company was established by Jacques-Félix Sincennes and other Montreal businessmen. The company was amalgamated with Sir Hugh Allan&#x27;s Canadian Navigation Company, to form the Richelieu and Ontario Navigation Company, in 1875. Subsequent growth over the years was tied to expansion of the canal system on the upper St. Lawrence River (the precursor to the Saint Lawrence Seaway), and to a new Welland Canal connecting to the upper Great Lakes.

The year of 1911 saw the merger of Richelieu and Ontario Navigation Company with James Playfair&#x27;s Northern Navigation Company. In 1911 the Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co. were allowed to increase their capital stock. At a special meeting of shareholders held on June 26, it was decided to increase the stock from $5,000,0000 to $10,000,000, with the distribution of new shares to be issued by the directors. The majority of the shares of the Northern Navigation Co. Ltd. and of the Inland Lines Ltd. were purchased and paid for with fully paid up stock of the R. And O Navigation Co. Five additional directors were added to the reorganized Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co. James Playfair became the vice president and managing director. The companies were allowed to continue operating under their respective names from that time.

In 1912 the Richelieu and Ontatio Navigation Co. took over the Niagara Navigation Company, covering operation of the steamboats &quot;Cayuga&quot;, &quot;Chicora&quot;, &quot;Chippewa&quot;, &quot;Carona&quot; and &quot;Ongiara,&quot; operating under the banner of the Niagara-Toronto Division and the Hamilton Division including the Hamilton Steamboat Company&#x27;s steamships &quot;Macassa&quot; and &quot;Modjeska&quot; were also acquired along with the &quot;Turbinia,&quot; formerly owned by the Turbine Steamship Co. Both companies had been absorbed into the Niagara Navigation Company. From that time, on, the new company advertised their services via the tag line &quot;Niagara To The Sea&quot; in brochures, indicating their coverage of the passenger trades from the Niagara to the St. Lawrence regions.

The launching of the Northern Navigation was set for June 2, 1913. A large number of Richelieu and Ontario Navigation Co.&#x27;s directors and guests went from Sarnia, Ontario on the &quot;Hamonic&quot; to witness the event. Shortly after the &quot;Hamonic&quot; entered Lake Superior, the managing director James Playfair was notified of the passing of his father John S. Playfair and he was transferred mid-lake to an R and O freighter, about from Sault Ste. Marie and returned to Toronto by special train. The christening of the &quot;Noronic&quot; was performed by Mrs. E. Bristol, the wife of another director, instead of by Mrs. Playfair, as at first intended.

A special meeting of the shareholders of Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co. was held in the company&#x27;s office in Montreal, on June 19, 1913, to ratify an agreement of sale of the company&#x27;s assets to a new company formed for that purpose. The new company was to be called Canada Transportation Lines Limited and would include acquisition of: Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Company Ltd.; Inland Lines Ltd.; Northern Navigation Co. Ltd,; St. Lawrence River Steamboat Co. Ltd.; Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co. of the United States.; Quebec Steamship Co. Ltd.; Canada Interlake Line, Ltd.; Ontario and Quebec Navigation Co., Ltd.; Merchants&#x27; Montreal Line; SS &quot;Haddington&quot; and Thousand Island Steamboat Co., Ltd.

In the early part of December it was announced that Canada Transportation Lines would be renamed Canada Steamship Lines Limited.

==Growth and disaster on the Great Lakes==
CSL&#x27;s growth through the industrial booms of both world wars was largely tied to the increasing importance of the steel industry in Ontario, where mills were built, or soon to be built, in Sault Ste. Marie, Hamilton, and Nanticoke. CSL also tapped into the last of the remaining coal traffic from Pennsylvania across the Great Lakes to railways in Canada. Following railway dieselization, subsequent coal traffic would be moved by CSL to large fossil-fuel burning electrical power plants.

In addition to its cargo shipping, the company expanded its overnight passenger shipping traffic as well. Most notably the popular , and of the old Niagara Navigation Company 1902–1912 lineage (roughly 6,000 GRT and 350 foot a piece). Their last passenger ships, however, came out in 1928. They were the cruise ships &quot;St. Lawrence&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot; and &quot;Tadoussac&quot;; all built at the Davie Shipbuilding and Repair Co. in Lauzon, P.Q. &quot;St. Lawrence&quot; was built in 1927, and &quot;Quebec&quot; and &quot;Tadoussac&quot; were identical sister ships of 1928. They ran together with &quot;Richelieu&quot;, the former &quot;Narraganset&quot; (1913) of Long Island Sound, which was purchased by CSL about the same time the other three were built by Davie. The three ships were all 350 feet in length, had a breadth of 70 feet, and were 8,000 tones GRT; &quot;Richelieu&quot; was slightly smaller. They sailed on the St Lawrence and Saguenay Rivers, departing from Montreal and stopping at Quebec City, Murray Bay and Tadoussac (where the company owned hotels) and up the Saguenay to Bagotville (La Baie). &quot;Richelieu&quot; was able to go on to Chicoutimi because of her shallower draft. &quot;Quebec&quot; burned at Tadoussac in 1950 with the loss of seven lives, and the other three ships continued on the route until 1965. After the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, &quot;Tadoussac&quot;″s bow was modified to make her able to make a few trips into Lake Ontario, and even made occasional trips through the updated Welland Canal to Buffalo and Detroit in the early 1960s. With the fire in 1965 near the Bahamas, stricter coast guard safety regulations in the form of the new international SOLAS program put an end to the three ship&#x27;s long careers. The &quot;Richelieu&quot;, &quot;St. Lawrence&quot;, and &quot;Tadoussac&quot; were all sold to Joseph de Smedt of Belgium. &quot;Tadoussac&quot; was renamed &quot;Passenger No. 2&quot; and &quot;Richelieu&quot;, &quot;Passenger No. 3&quot;. &quot;Passenger No. 2&quot; and the old &quot;St. Lawrence&quot; were eventually scrapped after serving as accommodation ships in the early 1970s, while &quot;Passenger No. 3&quot; was sold to Danish interests and was renamed &quot;St. Lawrence 2&quot; and served as an accommodation ship for Eastern Bloc refugees before being sold to Arab interests in 1975 as workers&#x27; barracks in Sharjah, UAE, where she became half-buried in sand by 1981, and scrapped down by 1990. The earlier &quot;Hamonic&quot; had burned due to a dock side fire in 1945 at Point Edward and was later scrapped. &quot;Huronic&quot; had already been converted to carry only freight by 1944, was retired and scrapped in 1950.

CSL was found responsible for the disastrous September 1949 fire and destruction of its ship the in Toronto Harbour. The fire swept through the ship killing 118 to 139 passengers (many as they slept), but no members of the crew. Inadequate alarm, passenger evacuation plans, and neglected extinguishing systems are found at fault. The captain was suspended one year for abandoning the ship before ensuring crew and passengers were safe. She was demolished in 1950.

No new passenger ships were built by this line or most other shipping lines due to the declining passenger ferry trade. To date, and despite something of a resurgence in passenger traffic on the Great Lakes in recent years, CSL has no known plans for a cruise ship service on or off of the Great Lakes.

==Power Corporation==
In 1951, Sir James Dunn, the owner of Algoma Steel, gained effective control over the company.

CSL saw operations increase exponentially in the late 1950s with the opening of the expanded Saint Lawrence Seaway and the timely discovery and exploitation of some of the world&#x27;s largest iron ore deposits on the Labrador Peninsula in Labrador City, Schefferville, and Mont Wright. Ore was moved to Sept-Îles and Port-Cartier by the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway and Cartier Railway respectively, where it was then loaded into bulk carriers for transfer to Canadian and U.S. steel mills on the Great Lakes. CSL exploited this traffic by continually refining its self-unloading bulk carrier designs, coupled with improvements in stevedoring at various ports to arrive at a minimal number of human operators required.

Following his passing in 1956, Dunn&#x27;s estate would eventually sell off the CSL shares. In 1963, a non-controlling share of CSL was purchased by Montreal-headquartered Power Corporation, a Quebec industrial conglomerate with interests in electricity generation, pulp and paper, and oil and gas. CSL continued operating and expanding its Great Lakes shipping line and the Collingwood and Lauzon shipyards through the 1960s, and witnessed several labour disputes.

===Paul Martin joins the board===
In 1969, Power Corporation took a controlling-share in CSL. On December 2, 1970, Paul Martin, the 32-year-old executive assistant to Power Corporation Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Maurice Strong, was appointed to the CSL board of directors. In 1971 CSL minority shareholders sold outstanding shares to Power Corporation, making CSL a Power Corporation subsidiary.

At this time, CSL was given elevated status, where in the words of Power Corporation &quot;...in order to increase its [Power Corporation&#x27;s] own cash flow and take advantage of new federal tax regulations benefitting operating companies over holding companies, CSL took over most of Power&#x27;s investment portfolio at book value.&quot;

===Paul Martin becomes president===
CSL suffered losses in 1972 when forced to cover unexpected cost overruns in the construction of three 80,000-ton ocean-going tankers at Davie Shipbuilding. On November 22, 1973 Paul Martin was appointed President and CEO of the CSL Group. In 1974, CSL earnings were further hurt by an eight-week strike on the Great Lakes.

In 1976, Power Corporation reversed itself and took over the investment portfolio which had been sold to CSL five years earlier. CSL reverted to an operating division of Power Corporation at this time. On June 7, 1981, CSL President and CEO Paul Martin announced plans to expand outside of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River: &quot;The Great Lakes are essentially a Canadian pond... Canadians have captured 95 percent of the business. Now we want our chance to try our wings on the oceans.&quot;

==Paul Martin buys CSL Group Inc.==
One month later, in July 1981, Power Corporation announced it was selling its subsidiary CSL Group for million. CSL Group at this time included the shipping company, shipyards, engineering firms, and a bus service (Voyageur, previously known as Provincial Transport). The following month, in August 1981, Paul Martin and his friend Lawrence Pathy with the help of Gordon Black, secured financing and announced their intention to purchase CSL Group Incorporated for the price advertised by Power Corporation.

On August 9, 1983, citing federal government interference in the shipping industry, Martin stated: &quot;then... they are going to come in with some grand and glorious package that will give the government control of the industry because they don&#x27;t understand private enterprise.&quot;

By the mid-1980s, CSL&#x27;s only remaining shipyard (Collingwood Shipbuilding) was undergoing financial difficulties and was closed on September 12, 1986, with the loss of 800 jobs. At the same time, CSL Group Inc.&#x27;s expansion outside of Canada was well underway. In November 1988, President and CEO Paul Martin was elected as a Member of Parliament and stepped aside from directing the day-to-day operations of the company.

In March 1991, following changes to Canada&#x27;s taxation laws regarding international earnings, CSL backed away from threats to move its headquarters outside of Canada, however in December the president who replaced Martin resigned in opposition to plans to move international operations outside the country.

Replacement management in April 1992 formed a new CSL Group Inc. subsidiary headquartered in Massachusetts to be called CSL International Inc. Canada Steamship Lines Inc. would remain as the Canadian operation under CSL Group Inc., and the conglomerate would remain headquartered in Montreal.

In November 1993, the newly re-elected Paul Martin was appointed to the cabinet and named Minister of Finance. On February 1, 1994, Martin placed his shares in CSL Group Inc. under a &quot;Supervisory Agreement&quot; to be managed by lawyers and financial advisors, although he would be allowed to intervene in company decision-making should events warrant.

In June 2002, Martin quit the cabinet as Minister of Finance to pursue a bid for leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. On March 11, 2003, Martin bowed to public and media pressure on his interest in CSL Group Inc. and announced that he would sell his interests in the company to his three sons, saying that his ownership would &quot;provide an unnecessary distraction during the leadership race.&quot;

On December 12, 2003, Martin became the 21st Prime Minister of Canada. On January 28, 2004, the federal government, in response to opposition party and media enquiries, revealed that CSL Group Inc. had received million in federal government contracts, grants and loans since Paul Martin became Minister of Finance in 1993. Earlier figures released in 2003 had suggested CSL Group Inc. had only earned in federal government contracts during this time period.

===Flag of convenience controversy===
Throughout the 1990s, CSL Group Inc. oversaw the reflagging of several former Canadian-registered vessels which were placed under the shipping registries of nations commonly referred to as flags of convenience, where safety and labour laws were relaxed to be more business-friendly. Canadian crews were replaced with cheaper Ukrainian ones.

==Operations==
CSL Group Incorporated operates Canadian (Canada Steamship Lines) and international (CSL International) subsidiaries. In 2001, they overtook Asia Pacific Marine Container Lines, also a Canadian shipping company, becoming the world&#x27;s largest fleet of dry-bulk self-unloading vessels.

==CSL fleet==
These lake freighters are all in the 700-footer class which are between long:

===Self-unloading vessels===

===New Trillium classes===

In the early 2010s, CSL introduced two new classes of vessels, both named the .
, commissioned in 2012, was the first lake freighter Trillium-class ship. The other ships in this fleet, , and entered service in 2013.

&quot;Rt. Hon. Paul E. Martin&quot;, entered service in 2012, was the first panamax Trillium-class ship. , commissioned in 2013, was CSL&#x27;s second panamax Trillium-class vessel. &quot;CSL Tacoma&quot;, also entered service in 2013, was the third ship in this group.

The first of two Trillium-class bulk vessels, &quot;CSL Welland&quot; departed Yangfan Shipyard in early November 2014, and reached Montreal on January 2, 2015. The second one, &quot;CSL St-Laurent&quot;, passed through the Panama Canal in January 2015.

===&quot;Nukumi&quot;===
In 2022 CSL received . The ship was built for servicing Windsor Salt.

<text>Olive Garden is an American casual dining restaurant chain specializing in Italian-American cuisine. It is a unit of Darden Restaurants, Inc., which is headquartered in Orange County, Florida. As of 2022, Olive Garden restaurants accounted for $4.5 billion of the $9.63 billion revenue of Darden. 
== History ==
The Olive Garden started as a unit of General Mills. The Olive Garden&#x27;s first restaurant was opened on December 13, 1982, in Orlando, Florida, by co-founders Blaine Sweatt, Mark Given, Gino DeSantis and Dave Manuchia. By 1989, there were 145 The Olive Garden restaurants, making it the fastest-growing units in the General Mills restaurant division. The Olive Garden restaurants were uniformly popular, and the chain&#x27;s per-store sales soon matched former sister company Red Lobster. The company eventually became the largest chain of Italian-themed full-service restaurants in the United States. 
General Mills spun off its restaurant holdings as Darden Restaurants (named after Red Lobster founder Bill Darden), a stand-alone company, in 1995. Olive Garden removed &quot;The&quot; from its name in 1998 as part of a rebranding which introduced the slogan &quot;When you&#x27;re here, you&#x27;re family&quot;. In 2009, Olive Garden was Darden&#x27;s most inexpensive restaurant chain with an average check per person of $15.00 (USD) versus over $90 at its sibling Capital Grille.

Brad Blum, a former president of Olive Garden, said that sales in existing restaurants sharply decreased, with a 12% decline occurring at one point, even though the company was quickly establishing new restaurants. Sandra Pedicini of the&quot; Orlando Sentinel &quot;said that &quot;Darden reinvented the Olive Garden in the 1990s, from a floundering chain into an industry star&quot;.

As part of a February 2011, Darden analyst conference, the parent group announced it intended to add more than 200 Olive Garden locations in the following few years. The announcement came after a previous announcement that the company would be expanding into potential new international markets for the chain, including the Middle East and Asia, due to the maturity of the North American market. The company also announced it would begin licensing franchising partnerships, a new direction for the chain and its parent, which had traditionally relied on expansion via company-owned locations exclusively.
In 2011, Darden announced that it was going to begin co-locating Olive Garden and sibling chain Red Lobster locations. The new restaurants were designed for smaller markets and had separate entrances and dining areas, but unified kitchen and support areas. Menus remained separate, with customers only able to order from the location they are seated in. In 2014, Darden Restaurants announced intentions to sell Red Lobster, to close two Olive Garden and Red Lobster co-locations in Georgia and South Carolina, and to convert the remaining four co-locations into standalone Olive Garden restaurants.

In 2010, Olive Garden generated $3.3 billion in sales. Its closest competitor, Carrabba&#x27;s Italian Grill, had generated $650.5 million in sales during the same year. By 2012, sales had decreased at Olive Garden. At the final quarter of 2011, sales at established Olive Garden locations had decreased by 2.5%. The Darden president and chief operating officer, said that Olive Garden at that point was &quot;a beloved, but somewhat expected brand&quot;. The company introduced a three-course meal for $12.95 to try to stop the decline.

In 2011, Olive Garden implemented a mandatory tip-out program which allowed them to cut more of their employees&#x27; hourly wages to $2.13 per hour. In October 2012, Olive Garden became one of the first national restaurant chains to test converting most of its staff to part-time, aiming to limit the cost of paying for health care benefits for full-time employees.

On July 9, 2014, Olive Garden launched a new logo and restaurant design. This included the addition of online ordering and smaller lunch portions.

In August 2019, Darden responded to false claims that Olive Garden was financing Donald Trump&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign, stating: &quot;We don’t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates.&quot; Financial records prove Olive Garden had not contributed to the campaign.

Following the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Anderson Cooper quipped the D.C. rioters would be going to celebrate at Olive Garden when they vacated the Capitol. Darden also replied to rumors that the chain would revoke its lifetime pasta pass to Sean Hannity was a &quot;spoof&quot;.

==Advertising and marketing==
Olive Garden&#x27;s original slogan was &quot;Good Times, Great Salad, Olive Garden&quot;. This was used when their main advertising focus was unlimited salad. When unlimited soup and breadsticks were added to the menu, the slogan was changed to &quot;When you&#x27;re here, you&#x27;re family&quot;. The slogan changed in early 2013 to &quot;We&#x27;re all family here&quot;.

In the fall of 2013, Olive Garden started a promotion for the &quot;Never Ending Pasta Bowl&quot;, where customers can eat all the pasta they want starting at $9.99. During the event, the restaurant served over 13 million bowls of pasta. In 2014, the restaurant continued the promotion but added the &quot;Never Ending Pasta Pass&quot;, where customers can eat all the pasta they wanted during a seven-week period for $99. This promotion was limited to the first 1,000 people to purchase the pass online. The Pasta Pass promotion has been offered every year since. In 2019, Olive Garden added the &quot;Lifetime Pasta Pass&quot; offered to first fifty diners to sign up for the never ending one. After granted the first pass selectees were then offered the chance to sign up for the second one.

===Tuscan Institute===
Despite Olive Garden&#x27;s advertising that it has a cooking institute in Tuscany, news outlets have reported that, in fact, there is no institute or school. Olive Garden does send a number of managers, trainers, and cooks to Tuscany each year, but they stay in a rented hotel and spend only a few hours at a time at a local restaurant in its off-season.

==Locations==
Newer restaurants are styled after a farmhouse in the town of Castellina in Chianti, Tuscany, on the grounds of the Rocca delle Macie winery. The farmhouse is home to the Riserva di Fizzano restaurant adjoining the company&#x27;s Culinary Institute of Tuscany which was founded in 1999.

As of February 13, 2022, the company operates 922 restaurants globally. 

Countries outside of the United States where Olive Garden operates are:
==Menu==
Olive Garden serves several types of Italian-American cuisine, including pasta dishes, steaks, and salads. The company advertises its breadstick product and centers its lunch menu around it. Additionally, the company advertises that its soups and sauces are made fresh in each location daily, instead of importing them from a commissary or outside vendor.

In June 2010, Olive Garden began to import parts of menu formats from its sibling chain, Seasons 52; it began selling smaller dessert portions which it called &quot;dolcini&quot;. These new products were modeled after Season 52&#x27;s &quot;mini-indulgences&quot; product line.

===Activist investor critique===

In September 2014, Starboard Value, an activist hedge fund that had acquired a significant portion of Darden&#x27;s stock and was challenging Darden&#x27;s management, released a 294-slide presentation assembled by its founder Jeff Smith, that focused on ways the company was wasting money and failing to satisfy customers. Chief among them was the shortcomings of Olive Garden, which earned considerable media attention. Starboard claimed they justified replacing Darden&#x27;s directors in an upcoming election with a slate of new directors sponsored by the hedge fund.

It cited details such as the unlimited breadsticks the chain offered diners, of which too many went to waste since they tended to go stale, Smith claimed, and paying extra for custom-length straws. The chain&#x27;s menu was too complex, with some of its 96 items making no sense, such as vegetable lasagna topped with chicken (&quot;if you wanted meat on your lasagna, you would order the meat lasagna&quot; the slide read). The chain also had stopped the common practice of adding salt to the water in which it cooked its pasta in order to secure longer warranties on the pots, which had Smith incredulous: &quot;Pasta is Olive Garden&#x27;s core dish and must be cooked properly.&quot; He included photos of poorly executed dishes purchased at Olive Gardens compared with the photos on the chain&#x27;s website, along with quotes from online reviews posted by disappointed customers.

Darden&#x27;s management responded with a much shorter presentation two days later. Without going into specifics, it conceded most of Starboard&#x27;s critique was valid and that the company was already responding to those issues. It defended the unlimited breadsticks policy as &quot;convey[ing] Italian hospitality&quot; and rebutted another claim the hedge fund had made: packaging for take-out food, which the hedge fund had claimed was dishwasher-safe and thus needlessly expensive, was in fact merely microwave-safe. Nevertheless, a month later shareholders voted to replace the company&#x27;s entire board of directors with Starboard&#x27;s slate.

<doc id="653203" wikidata="Q241263" url="?curid=653203" title="Kathleen Battle">
<text>Kathleen Deanna Battle (born August 13, 1948) is an American operatic soprano known for her distinctive vocal range and tone. Born in Portsmouth, Ohio, Battle initially became known for her work within the concert repertoire through performances with major orchestras during the early and mid-1970s. She made her opera debut in 1975. Battle expanded her repertoire into lyric soprano and coloratura soprano roles during the 1980s and early 1990s, until her eventual dismissal from the Metropolitan Opera in 1994. She later has focused on recording and the concert stage. After a 22-year absence from the Met, Battle performed a concert of spirituals at the Metropolitan Opera House in November 2016, and again in May 2024.

==Life and career==

===Early years and musical education===
Battle was born in Portsmouth, Ohio, the youngest of seven children. Her father was a steelworker, and her mother was an active participant in the gospel music of the family&#x27;s African Methodist Episcopal church. Battle attended Portsmouth High School, where her music teacher and mentor was Charles P. (Phil) Varney. In a 1985 &quot;Time Magazine&quot; interview, Varney recalled the first time he heard the eight-year-old Battle sing, describing her as &quot;this tiny little thing singing so beautifully.&quot; &quot;I went to her later&quot;, Varney recalled, &quot;and told her God had blessed her, and she must always sing.&quot; In that same interview, music critic Michael Walsh described Battle as &quot;the best lyric coloratura in the world.&quot;

Battle was awarded a scholarship to the University of Cincinnati – College-Conservatory of Music, where she studied voice with Franklin Bens and also worked with Italo Tajo. She majored in music education, and proceeded to a master&#x27;s degree in Music Education. In 1971 she began a teaching career at an inner-city public school in Cincinnati, continuing to study voice privately while teaching 5th and 6th grade music. Later, she studied singing with Daniel Ferro in New York.

===1970s===
In 1972, her second year as a teacher, a friend and fellow church choir member phoned her and informed her that the conductor Thomas Schippers was holding auditions in Cincinnati. At her audition Schippers engaged her to sing as the soprano soloist in Brahms&#x27; &quot;German Requiem&quot; at the 1972 Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy. Her performance there on July 9, 1972 marked the beginning of her professional career. During the next several years, Battle would go on to sing in several more orchestral concerts in New York, Los Angeles, and Cleveland. In 1973 she was awarded a grant from the Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund for Music to support her career. William Mullen, managing director of the Santa Fe Concert Association, was on the panel of judges who made the award. In 2004 he recalled:
We would meet monthly, listen to up-and-coming concert artists and give money to deserving artists for further study. A very young Kathleen Battle sang for us. The other judges thought her voice was too small, but I thought she had an incredible ability to communicate through music. I talked the other judges into giving her a grant.

Thomas Schippers introduced Kathleen Battle to his fellow conductor James Levine who selected Battle to sing in Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 8 at the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s May Festival in 1974. This was the beginning of a friendship and close professional association between Battle and Levine that would last for 20 years and resulted in several recordings and performances in recital and concert performances, including engagements in Salzburg, Ravinia, and Carnegie Hall. Battle made her professional operatic debut in 1975 as Rosina in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; with the Michigan Opera Theatre in Detroit. She made her New York City Opera debut the following year as Susanna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, and in 1977 made both her San Francisco Opera debut as Oscar in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; and her Metropolitan Opera debut as the Shepherd in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. The latter performance was conducted by James Levine. Battle made her Glyndebourne Festival debut (and UK debut) singing Nerina in Haydn&#x27;s &quot;La fedeltà premiata&quot; in 1979.

===1980s===
Throughout the 1980s, Battle performed in recitals, choral works and opera. Her work continued to take her to performance venues around the world. In 1980 she made her Zürich Opera debut as Adina in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;. In 1982, she made her Salzburg Festival debut in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, followed three days later by an appearance in one of the Festival&#x27;s &quot;Mozart Matinee&quot; concerts. In 1985, she was the soprano soloist in Mozart&#x27;s Coronation Mass at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican, conducted by Herbert von Karajan. That same year she made her Royal Opera debut as Zerbinetta in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;. In 1987 Karajan invited Battle to sing Johann Strauss&#x27; &quot;Voices of Spring&quot; for the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Day concert. In opera she sang a variety of roles including Oscar at Lyric Opera of Chicago and a highly acclaimed Semele at Carnegie Hall. She returned to Salzburg various times to sing Susanna, Zerlina, and Despina, Mozart roles which she also sang at several other opera houses during that period. Battle became an established artist at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1980s, singing more than 150 performances with the company in 13 different operas, including the Met&#x27;s first production of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;. Other opera houses where she performed include San Francisco Opera, English National Opera, Grand Théâtre de Genève, Vienna State Opera, and Deutsche Oper Berlin.

During this period, she received three Grammy Awards for her recordings: &quot;Kathleen Battle Sings Mozart&quot; (1986), &quot;Salzburg Recital&quot; (1987), and &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (1987). Battle&#x27;s 1986 collaboration with guitarist Christopher Parkening entitled &quot;Pleasures of Their Company&quot; was nominated for the Classical Album of the Year Grammy Award. She also received the Laurence Olivier Award (1985) for her stage performance as Zerbinetta in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; at the Royal Opera House, London. Critical response to Battle&#x27;s performances had rarely varied throughout the years following her debut. In 1985, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; pronounced her &quot;the best lyric coloratura soprano in the world&quot;.

===1990s===
The 1990s saw projects ranging from a concert program and a CD devoted to spirituals to a recording of baroque music, from performances of complete operas to recitals and recordings with jazz musicians.

In 1990, Battle and Jessye Norman performed a program of spirituals at Carnegie Hall with James Levine conducting. In the same year, she returned to Covent Garden to sing Norina in &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; and performed in a series of solo recitals in California, as well as appearing at the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Battle&#x27;s Carnegie Hall solo recital debut came on April 27, 1991 as part of the hall&#x27;s Centennial Festival. Accompanied by pianist Margo Garrett, she sang arias and songs by Handel, Mozart, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, Gershwin and Richard Strauss, as well as several traditional spirituals. The contralto Marian Anderson, who had ended her farewell tour with a recital at Carnegie Hall in April 1965, was in the audience that night and Battle dedicated Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;In the Silence of the Secret Night&quot; to her. The recording of the recital earned Battle her fourth Grammy award. Another first came in January 1992 when Battle premiered André Previn&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Honey and Rue&quot; with lyrics by Toni Morrison. The work was commissioned by Carnegie Hall and composed specifically for Battle.

In December 1993 she was joined by Martin Katz and Kenny Barron on piano and Grady Tate (drums), Grover Washington Jr. (saxophone) and David Williams (bass) at Carnegie Hall for a concert featuring the music of Handel, Haydn, and Duke Ellington as well as Christmas spirituals. During this time she also collaborated with other musicians including trumpeter Wynton Marsalis in a recording of baroque arias entitled, &quot;Baroque Duet&quot;; violinist Itzhak Perlman on an album of Bach arias; and flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal for a recital at Alice Tully Hall (also released on CD). In May 1993 Battle added pop music to her repertoire with the release of Janet Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Janet,&quot; lending her vocals to the song &quot;This Time&quot;. An album of Japanese melodies, &quot;First Love&quot;, followed in November 1993.

On the opera stage, she performed in a variety of Mozart, Rossini and Donizetti operas. Between 1990 and 1993, she performed in several productions at the Metropolitan Opera: Rosina in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; (1990), Pamina in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (1991 and 1993), and Adina (with Luciano Pavarotti as Nemorino) in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; (1991, 1992, and the Met&#x27;s 1993 Japan Tour). She also won her fifth Grammy Award in 1993, singing the title role of &quot;Semele&quot; on the Deutsche Grammophon recording conducted by John Nelson.

Although Battle gave several critically praised performances at the Metropolitan Opera during the early 1990s, her relationship with the company&#x27;s management showed increasing signs of strain during those years. As Battle&#x27;s status grew, so did her reputation for being difficult and demanding. In October 1992 when she opened the Boston Symphony Orchestra season, she reportedly banned an assistant conductor and other musicians from her rehearsals, changed hotels several times, and left behind what a report in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called &quot;a froth of ill will&quot;. 

In February 1994, during rehearsals for an upcoming production of &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, Battle was said to have subjected her fellow performers to &quot;withering criticism&quot; and made &quot;almost paranoid demands that they not look at her.&quot; General Manager Joseph Volpe responded by dismissing Battle from the production for &quot;unprofessional actions&quot; during rehearsals. Volpe called Battle&#x27;s conduct &quot;profoundly detrimental to the artistic collaboration among all the cast members&quot; and indicated that he had &quot;canceled all offers that have been made for the future.&quot; Any input that Metropolitan Opera music director James Levine (Battle’s close friend and collaborator for 20 years) may have had is shrouded in mystery. Battle was replaced in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; by Harolyn Blackwell. At the time of her termination from the Met, Michael Walsh of &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that &quot;the cast of &quot;The Daughter of the Regiment&quot; applauded when it was told during rehearsal that Battle had been fired.&quot; After she sang with the San Francisco Opera at this time, several backstage workers wore T-shirts that read: &quot;I survived the Battle&quot;.

In a statement released by her management company, Columbia Artists, Battle said: &quot;I was not told by anyone at the Met about any unprofessional actions. To my knowledge, we were working out all of the artistic problems in the rehearsals, and I don&#x27;t know the reason behind this unexpected dismissal. All I can say is I am saddened by this decision.&quot; Since then, Battle has not performed in opera.

For the remainder of the decade, she worked extensively in the recording studio and on the concert stage. She was a featured guest artist on the May 1994 album &quot;Tenderness&quot;, singing a duet, &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, with Grammy-winning jazz vocalist Al Jarreau. In 1995 she presented a program of opera arias and popular songs at Lincoln Center with baritone Thomas Hampson, conductor John Nelson, and the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s. She also released two albums in 1995: &quot;So Many Stars&quot;, a collection of folk songs, lullabies, and spirituals (with accompanying live concert performances) with Christian McBride and Grover Washington Jr. (with whom she had performed in Carnegie Hall the previous year); and &quot;Angels&#x27; Glory,&quot; a Christmas album with guitarist Christopher Parkening, a frequent collaborator. 

In 1997 came the release of the albums &quot;Mozart Opera Arias&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot;, a collection of sacred songs. In October 1998, she joined jazz pianist Herbie Hancock on his album &quot;Gershwin&#x27;s World&quot; in an arrangement of Gershwin&#x27;s Prelude in C minor. December 1999 saw the release of &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, on which she is the featured soprano in Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Pomp and Circumstance Marches&quot; performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chicago Symphony Chorus and conducted by long-time collaborator James Levine. In solo recitals she performed in cities including Los Angeles, New York, Cincinnati, and Chicago in programs that featured art songs from a variety of eras and regions, opera arias, and spirituals.

===2000–present===
Battle has continued to pursue a number of diverse projects including the works of composers who are not associated with traditional classical music, performing the works of Vangelis, Stevie Wonder, and George Gershwin.

In August 2000, she performed an all-Schubert program at Ravinia. In June 2001, she and frequent collaborator soprano Jessye Norman performed Vangelis&#x27; &quot;Mythodea&quot; at the Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens, Greece. In July 2003 she performed at the Ravinia Chicago Symphony Orchestra Gala with Bobby McFerrin and Denyce Graves. In 2006 she and James Ingram sang the song &quot;They Won&#x27;t Go When I Go&quot; in a Tribute to Stevie Wonder and she began including Wonder&#x27;s music in her recitals. In July 2007 she debuted at the Aspen Music Festival performing an all-Gershwin program as part of a season benefit. In October 2007, at a fundraiser for the Keep a Child Alive Charity, Kathleen Battle and Alicia Keys performed the song &quot;Miss Sarajevo&quot; written by U2&#x27;s Bono.

On April 16, 2008, she sang an arrangement of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer for Pope Benedict XVI on the occasion of his papal visit to the White House. This marks the second time she sang for a pope. (She first sang for Pope John Paul II in 1985 as soprano soloist in Mozart&#x27;s Coronation Mass.) Later that year, she performed &quot;Superwoman&quot; on the American Music Awards with Alicia Keys and Queen Latifah. Since that time she has appeared in the occasional piano-voice recital, including a recital of works by Schubert, Liszt, and Rachmaninoff in Costa Mesa, California accompanied by Olga Kern (February 2010) and a recital in Carmel, Indiana, accompanied by Joel A. Martin (April 2013).

After a 22-year absence from the Metropolitan Opera House, Battle performed a concert of spirituals at the Met in November 2016. Battle later performed at the Metropolitan Opera again on May 12, 2024 where she received a standing ovation at the beginning of the concert upon entering the stage.

<text>The Second Battle of Zurich (25–26 September 1799) was a key victory by the Republican French army in Switzerland led by André Masséna over a Russian force commanded by Alexander Korsakov near Zürich. It broke the stalemate that had resulted from the First Battle of Zurich three months earlier and led to the withdrawal of Russia from the Second Coalition. Most of the fighting took place on both banks of the river Limmat up to the gates of Zürich, and within the city itself. The same days saw a battle between Hotze&#x27;s Austrians and Soult&#x27;s French at the River Linth. It was arguably the most significant French victory of 1799.

==Background==

After the First Battle of Zurich Masséna had consolidated to a defensive line behind the lower reaches of the Aare River. At this time his entire army in Switzerland consisted of around 77,000 combatants, positioned as:
* 1st Division (Turreau) in the Upper Valais and the Simplon Pass.
* 2nd Division (Lecourbe) in the St Gotthard and the valley of the Reuss.
* 3rd Division (Soult) Right wing near Glarus, centre on the left bank of the Linth, the left near Adliswil on the Sihl.
* 4th Division (Mortier) on the Uetliberg.
* 5th Division (Lorge) on the left bank of the Limmat between Altstetten and Baden.
* 6th Division (Ménard) from Baden to the confluence of the Aare with the Rhine.
* 7th Division (Klein) formed the Reserve in the Frick-thal.
* 8th Division (Chabran) at Basel.

Following the overall strategic plan, the Austrian army under the Archduke Charles was to be augmented by the 25,000 man Russian command of Korsakov, newly arrived at Schaffhausen after a 90-day march.

Masséna meanwhile was preparing an offensive on his right flank against the Austrian positions in the Alps. On 15 and 16 August General Claude Lecourbe with 12,000 men drove the forces of Gottfried von Strauch and Joseph Anton von Simbschen from the St. Gotthard, Furka and Oberalp Passes in a series of violent assaults. As a distraction, on 14 August French forces under Soult made demonstrations across the Sihl below Zürich.

On the night of 16/17th Archduke Charles supported by Korsakov&#x27;s troops launched a surprise attack over the river Aare at Gross-Döttingen using boats and pontoon bridges, but his engineers misjudged the strength of the current and depth of the river, the pontoon bridge was unable to be secured and eventually after serious fighting the attack was called off. Archduke Charles and Korsakov planned no further joint action however, as following the strategic plans of the Austrian Hofkriegsrat under Baron Thugut, Charles had been ordered to move his main command north into southern Germany. Reluctantly following these instructions, he left behind a column of 29,000 men under Friedrich von Hotze, and Korsakov&#x27;s command with the Swiss in the Austrian service. The plan for these two commands was to wait for the arrival of the Russian column of Suvorov penetrating north from Italy over the Alpine passes and trap Masséna in a 3-point encirclement.

== French Troops ==
The French troops which took part in the battle included:

* &quot;23éme Régiment de Chasseurs à Cheval (Légion de Ardennes)&quot;
* &quot;9éme Régiment de Hussards (la Liberté)&quot;
* &quot;2éme Demi-Brigade d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot;
* &quot;37éme Demi-Brigade d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot;
* &quot;46éme Demi-Brigade d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne (Deuxieme Formation)&quot;
* &quot;57éme Demi-Brigade d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot;
* &quot;102éme Demi-Brigade d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot;
* &quot;10éme Demi-Brigade d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot;

==Initial situation==

On 22 August Korsakov and Hotze agreed that the Russians with 22,000 men would line the lower reaches of the River Limmat (Aare), and Hotze with 20,000 men would occupy the Obersee region below Lake Zürich from the Linth to Glarus.

On 28 August the bulk of the troops of Archduke Charles departed Switzerland. Korsakov himself arrived in Zürich the following day, quickly displaying a vain over-confidence in the capabilities of his troops and disregard both for the French and his allies the Austrians:
At the end of August the Allied army stood as follows.

Korsakov with 33,000 men around Zürich and the Lower Limmat, distributed as:
* Division Lieutenant-General Gorchakov (Korsakov&#x27;s main body in the Camp of Sihlfeld, between the Uetliberg and Limmat):
Brigades of General-Major Tuchkov (6,314 men) and General-Major Essen (2,237 men) at Wollishofen. 
Total with gunners 10,330 men.

* Division of Lieutenant-General Durasov:
Brigade of General-Major Markov in a camp before Weiningen opposite Dietikon (2,000 grenadiers and 300 cossacks) 
Brigade of General-Major Pushchin in a camp at Würenlos and in front of the village of Wettingen: 2,500 infantry, 1,000 cossacks (8 battalions, 10 squadrons).
Along the right banks of the Limmat from Baden to the Rhine (1,000 men).
Total with gunners 7,052 men.

* The cavalry and cossacks (3,000 men) under Major-General Gudovich were distributed on the Rhine along the line of the road from Zürich to Baden.
* Reserve Division Lieutenant-General Sacken, 5,700 men initially in a camp at Regensdorf, then along the north bank of Lake Zürich connecting to Hotze.

Nauendorf, with 5,400 Austrians, on the right bank of the Rhine between Waldshut and Basel.

Hotze with 25,000 Austrians, including 3,000 Swiss, from Uznach to Chur and Disentis.

Suvorov with 28,000 Russians on the march from Italy through the Alps.

Shortly before the battle Korsakov detached Osten-Sacken&#x27;s 5,000 man Reserve Division to Rapperswil to reinforce Hotze in anticipation of Suvorov&#x27;s approach, consequently weakening his defensive line along the Limmat before Zürich and exposing his line of communications.

The departure of Archduke Charles gave the French a momentary superiority in numbers, Masséna was determined to exploit this and the redistribution of Austrians and Russians. His aim was to beat Korsakov and Hotze before any intervention by Suvorov. On 30 August he attempted to cross the Aare and push back the enemy before Zürich. This river crossing was unsuccessful, and Masséna now planned a crossing near Dietikon with a subsequent attack on Korsakov in Zürich.

On 19 September, Masséna revealed his plan to his division commanders. Lorge&#x27;s Division and part of Ménard&#x27;s would cross the Limmat from Dietikon and attack Korsakov in Zürich. The remainder of Ménard&#x27;s command would occupy the enemy by demonstrating at Vogelsang. At the same time Mortier&#x27;s Division was to hold the attention of Korsakov&#x27;s main body in front of Zürich by attacking Wollishofen. Klein was to cover the Alstetten road, while the Division of Soult was to cross the Linth at Bilten and prevent Hotze from assisting the Russians. All the boats available for transportation were assembled at Brugg, while a pontoon bridge was constructed at Rottenschwil to mislead the enemy as to the point of crossing. Since June, French boats had been gathered from different waters and transported over land and water. By September, 37 boats of different types were gathered in secret near Dietikon. Under cover of the night of 23/24 September Artillery General Dedon dismantled the pontoon bridge at Rottenschwil and transported it by convoy across the mountain to Dietikon.

On 24 September news came that Suvorov&#x27;s troops had finally conquered the Gotthard Pass (see Battle of Gotthard Pass). This delayed success for the Russians made the joint attack of Korsakov, Hotze and Suvorov impossible, but it persuaded Masséna to bring forward his attack from 26 to 25 September.

==The Crossing of the Limmat==

On the evening of 24 September Masséna&#x27;s troops concentrated at Dietikon amounted to more than 8,000 men of Lorge&#x27;s infantry division and 26 guns, all laying silently in the vicinity of the river. On the other side of the Limmat between Würenlos and Wipkingen they were faced by only 2,600 Russians under Major General Markov, including 1,100 men under Markov himself in Oetwil Würenlos, 290 men and 2 guns of the Misinov Cossack regiment between the rise of the monastery drive and the pine woods, 220 men of a Grenadier Battalion on the western edge of the pine woods and four squadrons of dragoons, with 550 men under Colonel Dmitry Dmitrievich Shepelev at Wipkingen.

On 25 September at 04:45 as boats were rapidly launched across the Limmat the alarm was raised, and initial shots fired by a battalion of Gazan&#x27;s Advance Guard Brigade signalled the beginning of the attack. With prompt efficiency approximately 600 men in 37 boats crossed the Limmat and formed a bridgehead on the opposite bank. The crossing of the boats alerted the weak Russian outposts on the opposite bank, but despite several rounds of musketry and artillery not a single boat was sunk, or a man drowned. At this point the Limmat sweeps back in a wide arc to the south, allowing Masséna&#x27;s artillery to fire from both sides of the river bend on the landing and deeper beyond the bridgehead. 25 shots hit various buildings of the monastery. As more French crossed, firing from the left bank ceased in fear of hitting their own men, and all effort was placed into traversing the river.

At 05:00 Dedon directed the erection of the pontoon bridge. The French bridgehead was exposed to Russian artillery fire from the heights of Kloster-Fahr and the pine woods. This plateau, defended by seven guns and Markov&#x27;s reserves was forthwith attacked, and after hard fighting by 06:00 the Russians were driven back, Markov wounded and taken prisoner. Barely an hour after the first shots the French had crossed 800 men and were in possession of the pine wood and the Russian camp. Behind them the pontoon bridge was rapidly assembled and completed at 07:30. By 09:00 the entire division of Lorge was on the right side of the Limmat with 8,000 men and a total of 26 guns.

Masséna aimed to prevent the Russian right wing under Durasov joining their left at Zürich, and now quickly sent Bontemps with his brigade to gain the slopes of the mountains of the Glatt and cut the communications between Regensberg and Zürich. Bontemps&#x27; left was covered by 2 battalions of Quétard&#x27;s brigade on the Wurenlos road. All the other troops, some 15,000 men including the advance guard under Gazan, followed chief of staff Nicolas Oudinot in the direction of Höngg.

==Mortier&#x27;s attack==
Meanwhile, at 05:00 Mortier&#x27;s Division had launched its feint attacks against Korsakov&#x27;s main command. His left under Brunet advanced to the small plateau at Wiedikon where they were soon pinned down by superior forces. His right under Drouet drove the Russians from Wollishofen, but were soon counter-attacked by Gorchakov&#x27;s six battalions, assisted by William&#x27;s flotilla of gunboats, and pushed back towards the Uetli.

Gorchakov however, not satisfied with merely repulsing the enemy attack, pursued the French to the Uetliberg and succeeded in capturing some batteries. This gain was however to contribute to the day&#x27;s disaster, as the French success on the right bank, together with Klein&#x27;s advance from Alstetten onto the Sihlfeld plane enfiladed the right of the Russian corps, obliging Korsakov to withdraw it at 13:00. 

Closely pursued as they retreated, Gorchakov&#x27;s men suffered considerable loss.

==Ménard&#x27;s feint==

The river crossing over the Limmat was successful as the Russians were too weak in their front section, and because they had been distracted away from Dietikon with feints by Mortier&#x27;s Division at Wollishofen and Ménard&#x27;s Division at Vogelsang. Ménard had succeeded in completely outwitting the Russians with his attack and also demonstrations against Brugg. From daybreak he had opened a barrage of artillery fire with all his guns in the vicinity of Baden and at the confluence of the Aare and Limmat against Durasov&#x27;s forces, spread his remaining brigade out in full view of the enemy, and put into motion the remaining boats on the river. Durasov was completely duped by this, and stationed his troops nearly the entire day between Freyenwyl and Wurenlingen. By the time he realised his mistake and marched to rejoin troops on the heights of Oetlikon he found the passage barred by Bontemp&#x27;s brigade, and had to make a substantial detour to Zürich, where he arrived late at night.

At Vogelsang Ménard succeeded in throwing a small detachment over the Limmat on boats transported overland from the Aare while under fire, this enabled him to re-establish a flying bridge, with which he crossed part of his command the next morning.

==Battle closes on Zürich==
In Zürich, Korsakov had felt his position secure to the extent that he had not made a single inspection of the line, nor had he removed his baggage or hospitals to a safe distance; instead, everything was left jumbled up in the city. Roused by the cannonade, he rode out to Höngg with a small detachment of troops and learned of Markov&#x27;s defeat. Nevertheless, he was convinced that the crossing of the Limmat was merely a demonstration, and that the main threat came from Mortier&#x27;s attack on Wollishofen.

By 10:00 the French were advancing on both banks of the Limmat supported by a heavy artillery barrage. Oudinot seized Höngg and the Wipkingen Heights from the weak detachment left by Korsakov, then, joined by part of the Reserve, at shortly before 15:00 he began attacking the Zürichberg, held by several Russian battalions. Gazan marched to Schwamendingen to cut the road to Winterthur. By this time Korsakov had finally become aware of his dangerous situation and withdrew troops from the right bank through Zürich to face the advancing Oudinot, however they could only do this by filing through the narrow streets of the town, jammed with wounded and baggage. A barrage of howitzer shells from the French further increased the confusion and impeded the Russians even more. By the time they had cleared Zürich it was too late, the French had gained the mountain on that side of town and on the plains took possession of the Beckenhof country house. The Russians attacked bravely, but could make no impression on the troops of Lorges, supported by the Helvetian Legion. In the meantime four Russian battalions sent back to Zürich by Hotze arrived, Korsakov put himself at their head and with the help of Bachmann&#x27;s Swiss Legion drove back the French to the foot of the Heights of Wipkingen. Gazan however, held on at Schwamendingen. The Russian counterattacks against the Zürichberg, though incredibly brave, were inadequate in number and &quot;instead of gaining the heights, the troops kept fighting before the gate, and charging the enemy with the bayonet among the vines and hedges, in a ground which did not admit of such an operation&quot;.

As night drew on Korsakov shut himself up in Zürich, having conceded the plains to the French. Masséna summoned the town but received no answer.

==Soult&#x27;s Attack against Hotze==

While all this was going on around Zürich, at the eastern end of Lake Zürich the Austrian corps of Hotze faced the French division of Jean-de-Dieu Soult in the channels and marshes around the lower Linth and the Walensee. For days beforehand Soult had dressed himself in an ordinary infantryman&#x27;s uniform and performed outpost duty to observe the Austrian positions. The Battle of Linth River began at 02:30 on the 25th when a small group of soldiers, stripped to their underclothes, with pistols and ammunition tied above their heads and swords in their teeth, swam across the channel near Schänis. They were able to pull up rafts with ropes, and under the darkness and a thick mist which lingered all day, a whole battalion was ferried across before the alarm was raised. Similar crossings were made at Grynau Castle and Schmerikon. At 04:00 Hotze was awakened by the noise of artillery fire and rode out to find his troops fighting bravely at Schänis. He then rode with his chief of staff towards Weesen to reconnoitre, but in the fog they ran into French troops concealed in a wood. As the two Austrians turned to flee they opened fire and both men were shot dead. News of the death of Hotze spread quickly and the dismayed Austrians now under the hapless command of Franz Petrasch fell back towards Lichtensteig, abandoning their small flotilla of boats at Rapperswil.

Further east on Soult&#x27;s right flank, Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor&#x27;s brigade had been attacked by the Austrian far left flank columns under Franz Jellacic and Friedrich von Linken on the upper Linth. The two Austrians were unaware of the fate of Hotze&#x27;s and Korsakov&#x27;s forces and out of touch with each other. The French 84th Line Infantry demi-brigade held on behind the Linth all through 25 September, then counter-attacked on the following day. Encouraged by the defeat of Hotze, Molitor&#x27;s men drove Jellacic&#x27;s Austrians back towards Walenstadt. On the 25th, Linken&#x27;s column appeared in the Sernftal, surprising and capturing two battalions of the French 76th Line Infantry. Linken&#x27;s troops, which consisted of Joseph Anton von Simbschen&#x27;s brigade, soon found themselves opposed by a battalion of the 84th Line. By 27 September, Molitor attacked Linken after being reinforced by two of Soult&#x27;s battalions, but the fighting was inconclusive. On 29 September after more skirmishing, Linken gave the order to retreat to the Rhine valley after receiving a misleading note from a double agent and not getting any other news from Suvorov or Hotze.

==Actions on 26 September==
During the night Korsakov was finally joined by Durasov&#x27;s troops, and by the corps returned by Hotze from the Linth. Now mustering 16 battalions Korsakov was determined to hold his position at Zurich until he could be joined by Suvorov. That morning he received the news of the death of Hotze.

Facing the Russians, Oudinot assembled all the troops on the right bank to attack the Zürichberg – Bontemp&#x27;s brigade was to block the Winterthur road on the left. Lorge was to march along the Limmat to connect with the attacks of Klein and Mortier, who in their turn would advance by the Sihlfeld with Masséna at their head. By cutting the retreat of the Russians they would be driven into the lake.

At dawn the Russians launched a powerful attack against Lorge&#x27;s Division in two lines which succeeding in driving back Bontem&#x27;s brigade and re-taking the Winterthur Road, thus foiling the plan to drive them into the lake. This was very fortunate for Korsakov, as at that moment Klein and Mortier were bombarding Klein Zürich, and Oudinot&#x27;s ordinance breaking in the Höngg gate. Terrible confusion reigned in the confines of the town, Korsakov proposed a parley, but no one paid any attention. Instead the Russians began a general retreat, leaving only a weak rearguard in the town. Though he made no effort to prevent the withdrawal, Masséna advanced Dedon&#x27;s light artillery to successive positions to fire on the left flank of the retreating column, which spread complete disorder through their ranks. Masséna then ordered Lorge, Bontems and Gazan to charge the centre of the Russians, who defended themselves with desperation. Generals Sacken and Likotsuchin were severely wounded, the troops fought in isolated pockets without cohesion of any sort.

At the same time Oudinot broke through the Limmat gate, still defended by the Russian rearguard, while Klein stormed through Klein Zürich with the Reserve.

There was no pursuit and the Russians were able to retreat without further interference, however Korsakov determined to continue withdrawing with undiminished speed as far as the Rhine, and beyond. Wickham claims that the greater part of the Russian command were able to reach Eglisau unmolested by the French. Nevertheless, of an original force of more than 25,000 men, Korsakov finally reached the Rhine with 10,000 remnants via Bülach and Eglisau, having lost his baggage train, guns and military chest and records.

==Assessment==
The defeat of Korsakov came about through a combination of careful planning by the French and poor leadership on the part of the Russians. On his arrival at the front Korsakov had made no personal reconnaissances, but gave himself over to comfortable existence in Zürich and relied entirely on a misplaced faith in the superiority of his troops to all others. Masséna described him as &quot;more of a courtier than a soldier&quot;. Equally, the very rigid linear style of fighting the Russians had developed in their wars against the Ottoman Empire stood against them in this terrain against the more fluid French. Accustomed as they were to seize victory by aggressive bayonet advances to their front, it never occurred to them that they might be outflanked.
Korsakov and Petrasch have also been strongly criticised for their rapid withdrawal over the Rhine despite very little pursuit by the French and in full knowledge that Suvorov was struggling to join them from the south.

The Republican victory was undoubtedly Masséna&#x27;s greatest triumph, however he too has been criticised for failing to fully exploit his success. Rocquancourt, Jomini and the Archduke Charles question why Masséna on the evening of the 25th, when it became clear the Russians were concentrating against Oudinot, did not move up all of Klein&#x27;s reserve and the remains of Ménard&#x27;s Division to support the left wing and hence surround the Russians. Nevertheless, the action remains a brilliant feat of arms for the French.

==Aftermath==

Masséna, aware of Suvorov&#x27;s advance toward St. Gotthard, quickly shifted his troops southward. Lecourbe&#x27;s division had already performed heroics in delaying the Russians at the St. Gotthard Pass, and later at the spectacular crossing over the Reuss at the Devil&#x27;s Bridge. When Suvorov finally forced the Reuss he was met by units of Soult&#x27;s division blocking the route at Altdorf. Unable to break through the French lines and aware of Korsakov&#x27;s disastrous defeat, the Russian general turned east through the high and difficult Pragel Pass to Glarus, where he was dismayed to find other French troops awaiting him on 4 October.
Massena tried to defeat Suvorov, but the latter defeated him at Battle of Muottental, and then captured the important city of Glarus, which allowed him to calmly leave the encirclement. Russians have lost their baggage and artillery, and losing as many as 5,000 men. On 15 October the last Coalition troops left Swiss territory, which therefore returned to the control of the Helvetic Republic.

After the French victory Russia pulled out of the Second Coalition. The French extended their control of the territory of the Confederation and created favourable conditions for the attack on Austria. Under accusations of looting Masséna requisitioned enormous quantities of food, livestock and feed as well as soldiers and money. Want and misery dominated in the war-affected areas. The Second Coalition War had greatly weakened the Helvetic Republic, the consequent loss of popular support led ultimately to the 1803 Act of Mediation.

On the Zürichberg up a short forest trail and a monument to Masséna and the French. On the monument in the forest both battles of Zürich are briefly described. There is another commemorative memorial at Langnau am Albis south of Zürich to the defence of the Albis pass. In Paris the village names of Dietikon and Muta Thal are chiselled on the Arc de Triomphe. In Schöllenenschlucht (near the Devil&#x27;s Bridge) is a monument to the Alpine crossing of the Russians under Suvorov.

<text>&quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot; is an American military march composed by John Philip Sousa in 1899.

==History==
The march was written in 1899. When the march premiered on April 21 at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, the audience insisted that it be repeated three times. The march is &quot;addressed to no particular nation, but to all of America&#x27;s friends abroad.&quot;

In 1901, John Philip Sousa heard the Virginia Tech Regimental Band (The Highty-Tighties) playing &quot;The Thunderer&quot; at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Sousa was so impressed that he dedicated a performance of his latest march, &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot;, to the band.

Sousa prefaced the sheet music&#x27;s score with a quotation from the English diplomat John Hookham Frere: &quot;A sudden thought strikes me; let us swear eternal friendship.&quot; The march was composed in the wake of the Spanish–American War and is idealistic, in addition to patriotic, in nature.

&quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot; remains one of Sousa&#x27;s more popular marches and is still performed widely by bands.

==Composition==
One reviewer describes the march this way: &quot;Hands Across the Sea opens with a jaunty, carefree theme, the wind sonorities light and generally in their middle and upper ranges. An equally attractive march appears midway through, its manner initially mellow and nonchalant. It gradually turns more animated and colorful, the piccolo dancing merrily above suave wind sonorities. The work closes with this spirited theme playing proudly, the brass flamboyant, the cymbals crashing, and the whole brimming with festivity and vivid color. For band music enthusiasts and Sousa mavens, this three-minute gem will have great appeal.&quot;

<text>Canadice Lake is the smallest Finger Lake of western New York. The lake is located approximately south of Rochester. The name is derived from the Iroquois word &quot;ska-ne-a-dice&quot;, meaning &quot;long lake&quot;. The lake is part of the Genesee River watershed.

==Description==
Canadice Lake is long and wide at its widest point. The lake has a surface area of and a maximum depth of . The lake drains out into Canadice Outlet, which merges with water from the neighboring Hemlock Lake.

In 1873, the city of Rochester, New York was authorized to begin using the lake as a source of drinking water along with Hemlock Lake. A legal dispute with residents near the lake was resolved in favor of the city in 1886, and a conduit line was constructed which brought water from the lake to the city beginning in 1919. A treatment plant for the lake&#x27;s water was opened in 1993.

==Recreation==

The lake is still used as a water source for Rochester today. To protect the water quality, no houses are permitted on its shore and boats are limited to in length and a must have a 10-horsepower engine or less. Swimming, camping and contamination of the water are prohibited. Previously, a free permit was required to fish or boat on the lake, but that permit system has been discontinued and they are no longer required.

Canadice Lake features several trout species for recreational fishing, including lake trout, brown trout and rainbow trout. All three trout species are annually stocked in the lake by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Landlocked Atlantic salmon are occasionally stocked as well.

An unimproved gravel boat ramp is available for launching boats on the lake&#x27;s east side, and a cartop launch is available at the south end of the lake.

<doc id="653250" wikidata="Q968582" url="?curid=653250" title="Sanchuniathon">
<text>Sanchuniathon (; Ancient Greek: ; probably from , &quot;Sakkun has given&quot;), variant &quot;šknytn&quot; also known as Sanchoniatho the Berytian, was a Phoenician author. His three works, originally written in the Phoenician language, survive only in partial paraphrase and a summary of a Greek translation by Philo of Byblos recorded by the Christian bishop Eusebius. These few fragments comprise the most extended literary source concerning Phoenician religion in either Greek or Latin: Phoenician sources, along with all of Phoenician literature, were lost with the parchment on which they were written.

==The author==
All knowledge of Sanchuniathon and his work comes from the &quot;Praeparatio Evangelica&quot; of Eusebius (I. chs ix-x), which contains some information about him, along with the only surviving excerpts from his writing, as summarized and quoted from his purported translator, Philo of Byblos.

Eusebius quotes neo-Platonist writer Porphyry as stating that Sanchuniathon of Berytus (Beirut) wrote the truest history because he obtained records from Hierombalus priest of Ieuo (Ancient Greek: Ἰευώ), that Sanchuniathon dedicated his history to Abibalus (Abibaal) king of Berytus, and that it was approved by the king and other investigators, the date of this writing being before the Trojan War (around 1200 BC) approaching close to the time of Moses, &quot;when Semiramis was queen of the Assyrians.&quot; Thus Sanchuniathon is placed firmly in the mythic context of the pre-Homeric Greek Heroic Age, an antiquity from which no other Greek or Phoenician writings are known to have survived to the time of Philo.

Sanchuniathon claims to have based his work on &quot;collections of secret writings of the &quot;Ammouneis&quot; discovered in the shrines&quot;, sacred lore deciphered from mystic inscriptions on the pillars which stood in the Phoenician temples, lore which exposed the truth—later covered up by allegories and myths—that the gods were originally human beings who came to be worshipped after their deaths and that the Phoenicians had taken what were originally names of their kings and applied them to elements of the cosmos (compare euhemerism), worshipping forces of nature and the sun, moon, and stars. Eusebius cites Sanchuniathon in his attempt to discredit pagan religion based on such foundations.

This rationalizing euhemeristic slant and the emphasis on Beirut, a city of great importance in the late classical period but apparently of little importance in ancient times, suggests that the work itself is not nearly as old as it claims to be. Some have suggested it was forged by Philo himself or assembled from various traditions and presented within an authenticating pseudepigraphical format to give the material a patina of believability. Philo may have translated genuine Phoenician works ascribed to an ancient writer known as Sanchuniathon but in fact written in more recent times. This judgment is echoed by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;, which described Sanchuniathon as &quot;belong[ing] more to legend than to history.&quot;

Not all readers have taken such a critical view:
However that may be, much of what has been preserved in this writing, despite the euhemeristic interpretation given it, turned out to be supported by the Ugaritic mythological texts excavated at Ras Shamra (ancient Ugarit) in Syria since 1929; Otto Eissfeldt demonstrated in 1952 that it does incorporate genuine Phoenician elements that can now be related to the Ugaritic texts, some of which, as shown in extant versions of Sanchuniathon, remained unchanged since the second millennium BC. The modern consensus is that Philo&#x27;s treatment of Sanchuniathon offered a Hellenistic view of Phoenician materials written between the time of Alexander the Great and the first century BC, if it was not a literary invention of Philo.

==The work==
In surviving fragments of the text, it can be difficult to ascertain whether Eusebius is citing Philo&#x27;s translation of Sanchuniathon or speaking in his own voice. Another difficulty is the substitution of Greek proper names for Phoenician ones and the possible corruption of some Phoenician names that do appear.

===Philosophical creation story===
A philosophical creation story traced to &quot;the cosmogony of &quot;Taautus&quot;, whom Philo explicitly identifies with the Egyptian Thoth—&quot;the first who thought of the invention of letters, and began the writing of records&quot;—which begins with Erebus and Wind, between which &quot;Eros&quot; &#x27;Desire&#x27; came to be. From this was produced &quot;Môt&quot; &#x27;Death&#x27; but which the account says may mean &#x27;mud&#x27;. In a mixed confusion, the germs of life appear, and intelligent animals called &quot;Zophasemin&quot; (probably best translated &#x27;observers of heaven&#x27;) formed together as an egg. The account is not clear. Then Môt burst forth into light and the heavens were created and the various elements found their stations.

===Allegorical culture heroes===
Various descendants are listed, many of whom have allegorical names but are described in the quotations from Philo as mortals who first made particular discoveries or who established particular customs.

According to the text, the wind Colpias and his wife Baau (translated as &quot;Nyx&quot; &#x27;Night&#x27;) give birth to mortals Aeon, who discovered food from trees, and Protogonus &#x27;firstborn&#x27;); The immediate descendants of these were Genus and Genea, who dwelt in Phoenicia; &quot;and ... when droughts occurred, they (Genus and Genea) stretched out their hands to heaven towards the sun; for him alone (he says) they regarded as god the Lord of Heaven, calling him Beelsamen, which is in the Phoenician language &#x27;lord of heaven&#x27;, and in Greek &#x27;Zeus.&#x27;&quot; (Eusebius, I, x). Genus and Genea give birth to hôs, Pûr, and Phlox.

===The history of the gods===
The work includes a genealogy and history of various northwest Semitic deities who were widely worshipped. Many are listed in the genealogy under the names of their counterparts in the Greek pantheon, Hellenized forms of their Semitic names, or both. The additional names given for some of these deities appear usually in parentheses in the table below. Only equations made in the text appear here, but many of the hyperlinks point to the northwest Semitic deities that are probably intended. See the notes below the table for translations of the unlinked and several other names.

According to the text, as in the Greek and Hittite theogonies, Sanchuniathon&#x27;s El/Elus/Ilus/Cronus overthrows his father Sky or Uranus and castrates him, and surrounded his habitation with a wall, and founded Byblos, the first city of Phoenicia. However, Zeus Demarûs (that is, Hadad Ramman), who is the father of Melqart/Melicarthus (Heracles), purported son of Dagon but actually son of Uranus. When Uranus made war against Pontus, Zeus Demarûs invaded Pontus and joins with Uranus, although he (Zeus Demarûs) later vowed a sacrifice for his escape and Pontus put him to flight.

To El/Cronus is attributed the practice of circumcision. Twice we are told that El/Cronus sacrificed his own son: called Ieoud, Idoud, or Iedod in variant manuscripts. (Olyan says they reflect *yahid, &quot;only son&quot; or *yadid, &quot;beloved.&quot;) 

According to the text, El/Cronus, having laid an ambuscade for his father Uranus in a certain place situated in the middle of the earth, when he had got him into his hands dismembered him over against the fountains and rivers. There Uranus was consecrated, and his spirit was separated, and the blood of his parts flowed into the fountains and the waters of the rivers; and the place, which was the scene of this transaction, is shewed even to this day.

At some point, peace is made, and Zeus Adados (Hadad) and Astarte reign over the land with Cronus&#x27; permission. An account of the events is written by the Cabeiri and by Asclepius (Eshmun), under Thoth&#x27;s direction.

===About serpents===
A passage about serpent worship follows in which it is not clear what part is from Sanchuniathon and what part from Philo of Byblus:

==&quot;On the Phoenician Alphabet&quot;==
A further work of Sanchuniathon noted by Eusebius (&quot;P.E.&quot; 1.10.45) is a treatise &quot;On the Phoenician Alphabet&quot;.

<text>This is a list of United States state legislatures. Each state in the United States has a legislature as part of its form of civil government. Most of the fundamental details of the legislature are specified in the state constitution. With the exception of Nebraska, all state legislatures are bicameral bodies, composed of a lower house (Assembly, General Assembly, State Assembly, House of Delegates, or House of Representatives) and an upper house (Senate). The United States also has one federal district and five non-state territories with local legislative branches, which are listed below. Among the states, the Nebraska Legislature is the only state with a unicameral body. However, three other jurisdictions the District of Columbia, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands also have unicameral bodies.

The exact names, dates, term lengths, term limits, electoral systems, electoral districts, and other details are determined by an individual state&#x27;s laws.

==Party summary ==



Note: A party with a numerical majority in a chamber may be forced to share power with other parties due to informal coalitions or may cede power outright because of divisions within its caucus.

<doc id="653273" wikidata="Q5358569" url="?curid=653273" title="Electrostatic levitation">
<text>Electrostatic levitation is the process of using an electric field to levitate a charged object and counteract the effects of gravity. It was used, for instance, in Robert Millikan&#x27;s oil drop experiment and is used to suspend the gyroscopes in Gravity Probe B during launch.

Due to Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem, no static arrangement of classical electrostatic fields can be used to stably levitate a point charge. There is an equilibrium point where the two fields cancel, but it is an unstable equilibrium. By using feedback techniques it is possible to adjust the charges to achieve a quasi static levitation.

==Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem==

The idea of particle instability in an electrostatic field originated with Samuel Earnshaw in 1839 and was formalized by James Clerk Maxwell in 1874 who gave it the title &quot;Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem&quot; and proved it with the Laplace equation. Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem explains why a system of electrons is not stable and was invoked by Niels Bohr in his atom model of 1913 when criticizing J. J. Thomson&#x27;s atom. 

Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem holds that a charged particle suspended in an electrostatic field is unstable, because the forces of attraction and repulsion vary at an equal rate that is proportional to the inverse square law and remain in balance wherever a particle moves. Since the forces remain in balance, there is no inequality to provide a restoring force; and the particle remains unstable and can freely move without restriction.

==Levitation==
The first electrostatic levitator was invented by Dr. Won-Kyu Rhim at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993. A charged sample of 2 mm in diameter can be levitated in a vacuum chamber between two electrodes positioned vertically with an electrostatic field in between. The field is controlled through a feedback system to keep the levitated sample at a predetermined position. Several copies of this system have been made in JAXA and NASA, and the original system has been transferred to California Institute of Technology with an upgraded setup of tetrahedra four beam laser heating system. 

On the Moon the photoelectric effect and electrons in the solar wind charge fine layers of Moon dust on the surface forming an atmosphere of dust that floats in &quot;fountains&quot; over the surface of the Moon.

<doc id="653278" wikidata="Q55761529" url="?curid=653278" title="Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)">
<text>Protease inhibitors (PIs) are medications that act by interfering with enzymes that cleave proteins. Some of the most well known are antiviral drugs widely used to treat HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C and COVID-19. These protease inhibitors prevent viral replication by selectively binding to viral proteases (e.g. HIV-1 protease) and blocking proteolytic cleavage of protein precursors that are necessary for the production of infectious viral particles.

Protease inhibitors that have been developed and are currently used in clinical practice include:

* Antiretroviral HIV-1 protease inhibitors—class stem 
** Amprenavir
** Atazanavir
** Darunavir
** Fosamprenavir
** Indinavir
** Lopinavir
** Nelfinavir
** Ritonavir
** Saquinavir
** Tipranavir
* Hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitors—class stem 
** Asunaprevir
** Boceprevir
** Grazoprevir
** Glecaprevir
** Paritaprevir
** Simeprevir
** Telaprevir
* 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (including, but not limited to, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) inhibitors—class stem 
** Ensitrelvir
** Nirmatrelvir
** Simnotrelvir


Given the specificity of the target of these drugs there is the risk, like with antibiotics, of the development of drug-resistant mutated viruses. To reduce this risk, it is common to use several different drugs together that are each aimed at different targets.

In addition to those non-human proteases listed above, inhibitors of human proteases may be used to treat cancer. See the articles matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor () and proteasome inhibitor ().

==Antiretroviral protease inhibitors==
Antiretroviral protease inhibitors act by binding to the catalytic site of HIV protease, preventing cleavage of viral polyprotein precursor proteins into functional viral proteins required for viral replication. Most ARPIs are peptide-like molecules which resemble the substrate of the viral protease.

Protease inhibitors were the second class of antiretroviral drugs developed. The first members of this class, saquinavir, ritonavir, and indinavir, were approved in late 1995–1996. Within 2 years, annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 Prior to this the annual death rate had been increasing by approximately 20% each year.


== Non-antiretroviral antiviral activity ==
A drug combination targeting SARS-CoV-2, Paxlovid, was approved in December 2021 to treat COVID-19. It is a combination of nirmatrelvir, a protease inhibitor targeted to the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease, and ritonavir, which inhibits the metabolism of nirmatrelvir, thereby prolonging its effect.

==Side effects==
Protease inhibitors can cause a syndrome of lipodystrophy, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and kidney stones. This lipodystrophy is colloquially known as &quot;Crix belly&quot;, after indinavir (Crixivan).

<doc id="653283" wikidata="Q1334383" url="?curid=653283" title="Arête">
<text>An arête ( ; ) is a narrow ridge of rock that separates two valleys. It is typically formed when two glaciers erode parallel U-shaped valleys. Arêtes can also form when two glacial cirques erode headwards towards one another, although frequently this results in a saddle-shaped pass, called a col. The edge is then sharpened by freeze-thaw weathering, and the slope on either side of the arête steepened through mass wasting events and the erosion of exposed, unstable rock. The word &quot;arête&quot; is French for &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;ridge&quot;; similar features in the Alps are often described with the German equivalent term &quot;Grat&quot;.

Where three or more cirques meet, a pyramidal peak is created.

==Cleaver==

A cleaver is a type of arête that separates a unified flow of glacial ice from its uphill side into two glaciers flanking, and flowing parallel to, the ridge, analogous to an exposed mid-channel bar in a braided river. Cleaver gets its name from the way it resembles a meat cleaver slicing meat into two parts. A common situation has the two flanking glaciers melting to their respective ends before their courses can bring them back together; the exceedingly rare analogy to which is a situation of two branches of a braided river drying up before recombining.

The location of a cleaver is often an important factor in the choice of climbing routes. For example, following a cleaver up or down a mountain may avoid travelling on or under an unstable glacial, snow, or rock area. This is usually the case on those summer routes to the summit whose lower portions are on the south face of Mount Rainier, where climbers traverse the flats of Ingraham Glacier but ascend Disappointment Cleaver and follow its ridgeline rather than ascend the headwall either of that glacier or (on the other side of the cleaver) of Emmons Glacier.

==Examples==

Notable examples of arêtes include:
* Beenkeragh Ridge, MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks, County Kerry, Ireland.
* The Carn Mor Dearg arête on to Ben Nevis, Scotland
* Clouds Rest, in the Sierra Nevada, California
* Crib Goch, in Snowdonia National Park, Wales
* The Garden Wall, in Glacier National Park, Montana (image to right)
* Matthes Crest, in Yosemite National Park, California
* Knife Edge, in Baxter State Park, Maine
* Koncheto, Pirin mountain, Bulgaria
* Mazeno Ridge, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan
* The Minarets, in the Sierra Nevada, California
* The Sawtooth, in the Southern Rocky Mountains
* Strazhite (The guardians), Pirin mountain, Bulgaria
* Striding Edge in the English Lake District
* Trionite (The Saws), Rila mountain, Bulgaria

<doc id="653284" wikidata="Q1225014" url="?curid=653284" title="James Fergusson (architect)">
<text>James Fergusson FRS (22 January 1808 – 9 January 1886) was a Scottish architectural historian, mainly remembered for his interest in Indian historical architecture and antiquities. He was an important figure in the 19th-century rediscovery of ancient India. He was originally a businessman, and though not formally trained as an architect, designed some buildings and decorative schemes.

==Life==
===Education and India===
Fergusson was born in Ayr, the son of William Fergusson (1773–1846) an army surgeon turned medical writer, and inspector of hospitals. After being educated first at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and then at a private school in Hounslow, he went to India to work as a manager at his family&#x27;s mercantile house of Fairlie, Fergusson &amp; Co. of Calcutta. Here he became interested in the remains of the ancient architecture of India, little known or understood at that time. The successful conduct of an indigo factory, as he states in his own account, enabled him to retire from business after about ten years and settle in London.

His observations on Indian architecture were first published in his book on &quot;The Rock-cut Temples of India&quot;, published in 1845. The task of analysing the historic and aesthetic relations of this type of ancient buildings led him further to undertake a historical and critical comparative survey of the whole subject of architecture in &quot;The Illustrated Handbook of Architecture, being a Concise and Popular Account of the different Styles of Architecture prevailing in all Ages and Countries&quot;, a work which first appeared in 1855 in two volumes. It was followed in 1862 by one entitled &quot;A History of the Modern Styles of Architecture&quot;, being a sequel to the &quot;Handbook of Architecture&quot;.

The 1855 work was reissued ten years later in a much more extended form in three volumes, under the title of &quot;A History of Architecture in all Countries from the Earliest Times to the Present Day.&quot; The chapters on Indian architecture, which had been considered at rather disproportionate length in the Handbook, were removed from the general History, and the whole of this subject treated more fully in a separate volume, &quot;The History of Indian and Eastern Architecture&quot;, which appeared in 1876, as the fourth volume to &quot;The History of Architecture&quot;. The 1876 work was later revised with additions by James Burgess and Richard Phené Spiers in 1910 and published in two volumes.

===United Kingdom===
 In 1849 Fergusson published a metaphysical study, &quot;Historical Inquiry into the True Principles of Beauty in Art: More Especially with Reference to Architecture&quot;. Some of his essays on special points in archaeology, such as the treatise on &quot;The Mode in which Light was introduced into Greek Temples&quot;, included theories on Greek temples which did not receive general acceptance.

Like many of his contemporaries, Fergusson was concerned about British preparedness to resist a French invasion and he published &quot;An Essay on a Proposed New System of Fortification: with Hints for its Application to our National Defences&quot; (1849), &quot;The Peril of Portsmouth; or, French Fleets and English Forts&quot; (1852) and &quot;Portsmouth Protected: a Sequel to the Peril of Portsmouth&quot; (1856). In 1859, he was the only civilian appointed to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which subsequently recommended a huge programme of coastal fortifications that became known as &quot;Palmerston&#x27;s Follies&quot;.

He received the gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1871. Among his works, besides those already mentioned, are: &quot;Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored&quot; (1851), &quot;Mausoleum at Halicarnassus restored&quot; (1862), &quot;Tree and Serpent Worship&quot; (1868), &quot;Rude Stone Monuments in all Countries&quot; (1872), and &quot;The Temples of the Jews and the other Buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem&quot; (1878). The sessional papers of the Institute of British Architects include papers by him on &quot;The History of the Pointed Arch&quot;, &quot;Architecture of Southern India&quot;, &quot;Architectural Splendour of the City of Beeja pore&quot;, on the &quot;Erechtheum&quot; and on the &quot;Temple of Diana at Ephesus&quot;.

Although not a prolific practising architect, a small number of examples of Fergusson&#x27;s architecture remain in existence, the most notable of which are the parliament building of Jamaica, and the Marianne North Gallery in Kew Gardens.

Fergusson was adviser with Austen Henry Layard in the scheme of decoration for the Assyrian court at The Crystal Palace, and in 1856 assumed the duties of general manager to the Crystal Palace Company, a post which he held for two years. In 1866 he was a member of a committee to advise Henry Scott on design aspects of the Royal Albert Hall, along with architects William Tite and Matthew Digby Wyatt, and the engineers John Hawkshaw and John Fowler.

In 1847 Fergusson published an essay on the &quot;Ancient Topography of Jerusalem&quot;, in which he contended that the Mosque of Omar was the identical church built by Constantine the Great over the tomb of our Lord at Jerusalem, and that it, and not the present church of the Holy Sepulchre, was the genuine burial-place of Jesus. The burden of this contention was further explained by the publication in 1860 of his &quot;Notes on the Site of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem&quot;; and &quot;The Temples of the Jews and the other Buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem&quot;, published in 1878, which was a further elaboration of these theories, which are said to have been the origin of the establishment of the Palestine Exploration Fund.

Fergusson died in London on 9 January 1886 and is buried with his father on the west side of Highgate Cemetery.

<doc id="653302" wikidata="Q1635853" url="?curid=653302" title="Western Port">
<text>Western Port, (Boonwurrung: Warn Marin) commonly but unofficially known as Western Port Bay, is a large tidal bay in southern Victoria, Australia, opening into Bass Strait. It is the second largest bay in the state. Geographically, it is dominated by two large islands; French Island and Phillip Island. At the time it was renamed, its position was west of other known ports and bays, but Western Port has become something of a misnomer as it lies just to the east of the larger Port Phillip and the city of Melbourne. It is visited by Australian fur seals, whales and dolphins, as well as many migratory waders and seabirds. It is listed under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international significance.

The area around the bay and the two main islands were originally part of the Boonwurrung nation&#x27;s territory prior to European settlement. Western Port was first seen by Europeans in 1798 when an exploration crew in a whaleboat led by George Bass, journeyed south from Sydney to explore Australia&#x27;s south eastern coastline. Due in most part to a lack of food, the expedition was halted, spending two weeks in Western Port before returning to Sydney. As it was the most westerly charted point at the time, it was named &quot;Western&quot; Port.

The bay is home to the three Marine National Parks—French Island, Churchill Island and Yaringa, while the land adjacent to the north is largely used for farming purposes including cattle and wineries. Today the bay is mostly used for recreation; however, there is also a military base (HMAS Cerberus), shipping and oil production facilities adjoining the bay. Western Port is around one hour from Melbourne by car and a small number of holiday villages with sandy swimming beaches lie on its shores.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, the Bunurong people lived around &quot;Warn Marin&quot; living off shellfish, mutton birds and plant life. The bay was first explored by Europeans in 1797, when George Bass received permission from Governor Hunter in Sydney to sail a whaleboat along the unexplored section of coast south of Botany Bay. On such a rough stretch of water, Bass could not get more than halfway through the strait now known as Bass Strait. This voyage led to the recording of Western Port, so named because of its situation relative to every other known harbour on the coast at that time (the area from Point Hicks to Cape Howe), even though it lies to the east of Port Phillip and the city of Melbourne. Seal hunting was conducted here in the 19th century.

==Attempted colonisation==
In the year 1826 it was reported that the French had resolved to found a settlement at some Australian harbour – probably King George&#x27;s Sound or Western Port. The British Government at once sent instructions to Sydney for Governor Darling to immediately take possession of these places. As a result, Colonel Stewart, Captain S. Wright, and Lieutenant Burchell were sent in (Captain Wetherall) and the brigs &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Amity&quot;, with orders to proceed to Western Port, on 18 November 1826. They took a number of convicts and a small force composed of detachments of the 3rd and 93rd regiments. The expedition landed at Settlement Point, on the eastern side of the bay near present-day Corinella, which was the headquarters until the abandonment of Western Port at the instance of Governor Darling about twelve months afterwards, as unfit for civilisation,

Samuel Anderson established the third permanent European settlement in Victoria, after Portland and Melbourne, at Bass in 1835.

It was only after the end of World War II that serious consideration was given to the development of the port, and its flat shores north of Stony and Crib Points have become a centre for heavy industry.

==Geography==
Formerly a major river drainage system, it was inundated together with Port Phillip by the rising sea in the Holocene period; the Western Port sunkland now forms an extensive tidal bay. The waters of Western Port cover an area of 680 km² of which 270 km² are exposed as mud flats at low tide. The topography of Western Port is dominated by two large islands: French Island and Phillip Island. The coastline, including that of the islands, is some 263 km. The bay and its islands are criss-crossed by seven seismically active fault lines and experiences numerous minor earthquakes every year.

In the northern reaches, several rivers and creeks drain into the bay and flow through extensive mangroves, mudflats and sand banks before being channelled either side of French Island and into the open water in the southern reaches around Phillip Island. Several natural river paths and channels provide access for boats to the northern reaches; however, this is highly dependent on the tides and local knowledge is essential. Some of the major tributaries of Western Port are Bunyip River, Lang Lang River, Bass River, Cardinia Creek, Redbill Creek, Mosquito Creek, Brella Creek and Tankerton Creek. Until the mid 20th century, the Koo-Wee-Rup Swamp adjoined the bay in the north, covering an area of 30–40 thousand hectares, extending inland to present-day Pakenham, prior to cultivation of the land by early settlers. The mangroves in the northern reaches are the only remnants of this swamp today.

===Islands===
Western Port contains two large islands and several small ones; in approximate order of size:
* French Island - 170 km² (population: 116)
* Phillip Island - 100 km² (population: 9,000)
*Middle Spit - exposed at low tide
* Quail Island
*Tortoise Head Bank - exposed at low tide
* Churchill Island - 57 ha
* Chinaman Island
* Elizabeth Island
* Sandstone Island
*Reef Island
*Long Island
*Snapper Rock
*Pelican Island
* Barrallier Island
* Ram Island
* Joe Island

==Ecology==

===Flora===
Western Port supports a mosaic of habitat types including underwater seagrass beds, intertidal rock platforms, sandy beaches, intertidal mudflats, tidal channels, saltmarshes and mangroves. The coastline around Phillip Island is of State significance because of its remnant coastal tussock grasslands and dune scrub, a rare vegetation community in Victoria.

===Fauna===
Western Port consists of rocky platforms, sandy beaches and marine habitats. It is home to a diverse range of invertebrates including colonial ascidians, sponges and corals. Mudflats and mangrove swamps around the northern end of the bay support a large number of invertebrates that are an important food source for waders and visiting migratory birds. French Island is home to migratory waders, Australian pelicans, short-tailed shearwater rookeries, and many other significant fauna species. The bay has been identified as a 623 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it regularly supports small numbers of critically endangered orange-bellied parrots, over 1% of the world populations of Far Eastern curlews, red-necked stints and pied oystercatchers, and declining numbers of vulnerable fairy terns.

Phillip Island Penguin Reserve has the largest colony of little penguins in Victoria as well as a major colony of short-tailed shearwaters, with breeding hooded plovers and peregrine falcons. Seal Rock off Phillip Island is home to the largest colony of Australian fur seals and a breeding site of kelp gulls and sooty oystercatchers. San Remo&#x27;s marine community is a rich assemblage of marine biota listed under the State Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, 1988. The bay is listed under the Ramsar Convention for its internationally important wetlands.

The Moonlit Sanctuary Wildlife Conservation Park situated near the north western corner of the bay in Pearcedale offers a close up look at some of the indigenous mammals and birds of the region.

In recent years, the number of whale sightings (mostly southern right and humpback) has increased; local institutes conduct research of their presence in the bay and the neighbouring Port Phillip Bay and ask the public to report sightings.

=== Environment monitoring ===
Western Port&#x27;s marine water is monitored by the Environment Protection Authority of Victoria and was considered Good over the 2021-2022 period.

==Shipping and boating==
Deep channels lead from Bass Strait into the western section of the bay, giving access to the region&#x27;s port facilities. The town of Hastings is the main boat landing in the bay with the Yaringa Marina at Somerville also offering boat harbor facilities.

There are boat launching ramps at:
Stony Point -Concrete 3 lane ramp, 2 holding jetties, All Tides
Blind Bight -Tarmac Single lane ramp, Holding Jetty, High Tide
Corinella -Concrete 2 lane ramp, 2 Holding jetties, All Tides
Hastings - Concrete 4 lane ramp, Holding Jetty, All Tides
There are also ramps at Tooradin, Newhaven, Cowes, Warneet, Lang Lang, Grantville, Flinders, and Rhyll (Phillip Island).

A ferry runs between Cowes, Tankerton And Stony Point at certain times ( Check timetable at destinations) during the year.

Accommodation is available on both Phillip Island and French Island.

The boundary between the coastal waters of Bass Strait and the enclosed waters of Western Port is defined on the western side by a line from West Head on the Mornington Peninsula to Black Rock, Phillip Island. Then from Black Rock to the tip of Point Grant at The Nobbies on Phillip Island. On the eastern side, it&#x27;s a line from the southeastern tip of Cape Woolami, Phillip Island to Griffiths Point on the Bass Coast.

==Industry==
Western Port has several industrial complexes, including a BlueScope steel processing works and the major Royal Australian Navy training base, HMAS Cerberus. Holden Australia&#x27;s proving ground is located just east of Western Port. The Westernport Oil Refinery was operated by BP at Crib Point from 1966 to 1985.

Current development plans for the Port at Hastings would see it become the major shipping port for container and bulk freight in and out of Victoria. Substantial opposition to the development has been raised by local communities concerned with the scale of the development and its impact upon the fragile ecosystem of the bay. Blue Wedges and Preserve Westernport Action Group provide a voice for many of the objections raised by concerned locals.

==Regulations==
For the protection of the marine environment, a number of activities are prohibited within the boundaries of Victoria&#x27;s Marine National Parks and Marine Sanctuaries. No fishing, netting, spearing, taking or killing of marine life. All methods of fishing, from the shore or sea, are prohibited. No taking or damaging of animals, plants and objects or artefacts. There are strong penalties under the National Parks Act for fishing in Marine National Parks and Sanctuaries. All offenses can by reported to the Department of Primary Industries.

However, you may carry fin-fish on board your boat within park boundaries if you caught the fish outside the parks and you may also carry but not use, a fishing rod or spear gun. You may also have abalone or rock lobster associated equipment on board the boat provided that you are travelling straight through the park by the shortest practicable route.

<text>Sir David Brunt, KBE, FRS (17 June 1886 – 5 February 1965) was a Welsh meteorologist. He was Professor of Meteorology at Imperial College, London from 1934 to 1952. He was vice-president of the Royal Society from 1949 to 1957. The Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica is named after him.

He was born in Staylittle, Montgomeryshire, Wales, the youngest of the nine children of farmworker John Brunt. His father moved the family to the mining district In Monmouthshire to work as a coal miner. David attended the local Abertillery School from 1899 to 1904. In 1904 he secured a scholarship to enter the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth, where he studied mathematics, physics and chemistry, gaining a first class honours degree in mathematics in 1907. He then went to Trinity College, Cambridge and in 1909 was elected to the Isaac Newton studentship at the National Solar Physics Observatory.

After leaving Cambridge he spent a year as a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Birmingham and two years in a similar post at the Monmouthshire Training College, Caerleon. In 1916 he enlisted in the Royal Engineers (meteorological section) and during the war years did important work related to atmospherical conditions at low levels in chemical warfare. He later became meteorologist to the Air Force. After demobilisation he joined the Meteorological Office which in 1921 became the Air Ministry. He continued his personal research and accepted Sir Napier Shaw&#x27;s invitation to join him as part-time professor of meteorology at the Imperial College, London. After the retirement of Sir Napier Shaw, Brunt became the first full-time professor of meteorology in Britain, holding the chair from 1934 to 1952. Two years later was elected a Fellow of the college. He independently co-discovered the Brunt–Väisälä frequency.

Between 1936 and 1939 he contributed to a theoretical understanding of fog dispersal, information used in the development of the FIDO fog dispersal system.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1939 and was awarded their Royal Medal in 1944. He went on to serve as their secretary from 1948 to 1957 and as their vice-president from 1949 to 1957.

He served as president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1942 to 1944 and received both their Buchan prize and their 1947 Symons Gold Medal. He was also president of the Physical Society from 1945 to 1947.

He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1949 and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1959.

==Private life==

While he was working at Caerleon in 1915, he married Claudia Mary Elizabeth Roberts of Nant-y-glo, Monmouthshire, who had been a fellow student both at Abertillery and Aberystwyth. They had one son who died unmarried.

<text>Leonel Antonio Fernández Reyna () (born 26 December 1953) is a Dominican lawyer, academic, and was the 50th and 52nd President of the Dominican Republic from 1996 to 2000 and from 2004 to 2012. From 2016 until 2020, he was the President of the EU–LAC Foundation.

Fernández became the first elected president of the Dominican Republic under his political party, the Dominican Liberation Party (&quot;Partido de la Liberación Dominicana&quot;, or PLD), although party founder Juan Bosch was also sworn in as president in 1963 after the first democratic elections held in roughly four decades in the country. Fernández&#x27;s administrations have focused much on technological and infrastructural development and macroeconomic and monetary stability. He has served as the party president of the Dominican Liberation Party from 2001 until his resignation on 20 October 2019. He later founded the People&#x27;s Force and nominated himself as its party&#x27;s presidential nominee.

He is a native of Villa Juana, Distrito Nacional and lived for much of his childhood and early adulthood in New York City.

Leonel Fernández is a former the President of the World Federation of United Nations Associations (2018-2022) and a member of the Inter-American Dialogue.

==Early life==
Fernandez is the son of sergeant major José Antonio Fernández Collado and Yolanda Reyna Romero. In 1962, his family moved to New York City in the United States. They lived most of the time in the Washington Heights neighborhood, a dense Manhattan neighborhood, home to many Dominican New Yorkers.

After he finished high school, Fernandez returned to his country in 1968 and started law studies in the Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo. He joined the Dominican Liberation Party when it was founded in 1973 by former Dominican President Juan Bosch, leaving the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) to do so. Fernández was known as a close pupil of Bosch. He accompanied him as a vice-presidential candidate in the 1994 presidential election.

==First presidential term (1996–2000)==
The 1994 presidential election results, which resulted in a reelection of President Joaquín Balaguer, were widely opposed by runner-up opposition leader José Francisco Peña Gómez and his party. In the meantime, the international community rose their concerns on the tightening of the political tensions and fear the country was on the verge of a civil uprising. Upon an official agreement widely known as &quot;Pact for Democracy&quot; (&quot;Pacto por la Democracia&quot; in Spanish) a special election was scheduled for May 1996 and President Balaguer acceded to not run in this election as part of the arranged treaty. PRSC opted to present Vice-president Jacinto Peynado as their candidate, however PRSC supporters feared he was not properly endorsed by their historical leader, therefore creating a vast independent mass of electors.

In the first-round election on 16 May 1996 Fernández received 38.9% of the votes in the first round achieving second place behind José Francisco Peña Gómez and PRD. Peynado obtained 15% of the votes, the lowest outcome in Balaguer&#x27;s party history which initiated a long-term downfall. After 2010 Presidential election, PRSC lost briefly its official recognition as a majority party, but regained it after an alliance with PLD was announced by Leonel Fernández for 2010 mid-term elections, in where both parties achieved 100% of Senate positions and obtained over 2/3 of the seats on the Chamber of Deputies. In the run-off election, held on 30 June 1996, the &quot;Patriotic Front&quot; integrated, and Fernández thus secured 51.2% of the votes to win the election. He was sworn in as president on 16 August 1996, succeeding Balaguer.

During his term in office, Fernández&#x27;s political agenda was one of economic and critical reform. He helped enhance Dominican participation in hemispheric forums, such as the Organization of American States and the Summit of the Americas. The Dominican economy enjoyed an average growth rate of seven percent, the highest in Latin America for that period, and was among the highest in the world along with South Korea&#x27;s and the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s. Inflation was stabilized in the low single digits, also among the lowest of Latin America.

Fernández also began a visionary plan to run the Dominican Republic. When developers proposed the country&#x27;s first modern port during his first term, he said that &quot;We could be the Singapore of the Caribbean&quot;. In Santo Domingo and Santiago, which comprised 40% of the country&#x27;s population, he favored &quot;mega-projects&quot;, building numerous highways and tunnels which improved transit across the greater extent of these cities and created OMSA (Metropolitan Office of Autobus Services in English). His administration also gave incentives for foreign direct investment.

In 2000, Fernández was unable to run for a consecutive term as the 1994 constitution prohibited it. His party held primaries to elect a presidential nominee, which were won by Danilo Medina with 52% of the votes against Vice-president Jaime David Fernández Mirabal. Medina, who was sworn as the PLD candidate for the 2000 presidential election, was defeated by the PRD candidate, Hipólito Mejía. Mejia did not satisfy the 50% rule to avoid a feared run-off election, but Medina, who placed second, recognized Mejia&#x27;s win immediately.

==Second presidential term (2004–2008)==


Fernández was elected to a second term of office in the presidential election held on 16 May 2004 with an absolute majority and the second highest percentage ever in Dominican history of 57%. He was sworn in on 16 August 2004. His victory was due in large part to the collapse of the Dominican economy. This collapse has been attributed to skyrocketing oil prices and a slumping international economy post-9/11, excessive borrowing under the Mejía administration and the failure of three banks in the country: Banco Intercontinental (Baninter), Bancrédito and Banco Mercantil. In an effort to avoid further economic chaos, the Mejía administration effectively underwrote all three banks, repaying their customers but generating even greater public debt. Some of the bankers involved have been or are on trial, yet the extent of their fraud is hard to measure as their widespread largess with officials within both the Fernández and Mejía administrations has made it nearly impossible to achieve a true accounting of what conditions led to the bank&#x27;s demise.

According to local sociologist José Oviedo, &quot;The country trusts him with the economy, but he doesn&#x27;t seem to pay that much attention to social issues.&quot; The economic prosperity which his government prided itself on seemed to fail in reaching enough people. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the economy situation worsened during his last term.

The presidents of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela shook hands during the Rio Group summit, and agreed to end the dispute caused by a Colombian raid against FARC on Ecuadorian territory, for a special request from summit host
Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez at 7 March 2008. Such Honored act let Fernández received World Peace Culture Award on 6 April 2008.

==Third presidential term (2008–2012)==
During the Mejía administration, the constitution was changed to again allow the immediate re-election of presidents. Although Mejía was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for re-election, this opened the door for Fernández to attempt a similar run. On 7 May 2007, despite great controversy over whether the PLD party should support the concept of re-election, Fernández won the PLD primary election with a 72% voting percentage against his former Chief of Staff and confidant, Danilo Medina.

As a result, Fernández became the official PLD candidate for the presidency in the May 2008 General Election.

Fernández was declared the victor of the 2008 election, defeating six others, including the PRD candidate and former president Mejía&#x27;s right-hand man, Miguel Vargas, and the PRSC&#x27;s candidate, Amable Aristy. Fernández defeated Vargas 53% to 41%. Vargas accepted the defeat the same day, 16 May. Fernández was sworn in for his third term on 16 August 2008, with the traditional ceremony at the National Congress. An ongoing international economic crisis which occurred during this time did not prevent the Dominican Republic from remaining the fastest growing economy in Latin America, with a growth rate of 3.5 percent in 2009 and a projected growth rate of 6.5 to 7 percent in 2010.

== Corruption cases ==
Leonel Fernández has been accused of corruption on several occasionsduring his time as president of the Dominican Republic. In 2001, he was accused of embezzling $100 million from the Temporary and Minimal Employment Program, a fund intended to create jobs and quell strikes. He was also accused of awarding government contracts to his friends and family members without following proper procedures.

In 2009, Fernández was again accused of corruption, this time for his role in the construction of a new airport in Santo Domingo. The airport was built by a Chinese company that had close ties to Fernández&#x27;s government. The company was accused of overcharging the government for the construction of the airport, and Fernández was accused of accepting bribes from the company in exchange for awarding it the contract.

In 2012, authorities raided a local newspaper publisher and formally accused him of collaborating with Rajat Khare of the mercenary Indian hack-for-hire firm Appin to hack emails and extract information from the nation&#x27;s elite for his digital newspaper. The publisher later admitted that in 2011, he paid the Indian company between $5,000 and $10,000 a month to spy on over 200 prominent Dominicans—including Fernández.

On January 24, 2013, Leonel Fernández was accused of money-laundering related to the Global Foundation for Democracy and Development. However, all charges were dropped. 

Fernández has denied all of the corruption allegations against him. He has said that he is the victim of political persecution by his opponents. However, the allegations have damaged his reputation and have led to calls for his resignation.

In 2017, Fernández was indicted on charges of money laundering and bribery. The charges stem from his alleged involvement in a scheme to embezzle money from the Dominican government. Fernández has denied the charges and has said that he is the victim of a political witch hunt. The trial is still ongoing, and it is not clear when a verdict will be reached.

In addition to the criminal charges, Fernández has also been the subject of a number of civil lawsuits alleging corruption. In 2016, he was sued by a group of Dominican citizens who accused him of embezzling money from the government. The lawsuit is still pending.

== Civil society engagement ==
In 2000, Leonel Fernandez founded the Fundación Global Democracia y Desarrollo (FUNGLODE), headquartered in Santo Domingo, as a think tank as well as a resource and training centre. In 2002, he founded a sister organisation, the Global Foundation for Democracy and Development, dedicated to promoting collaboration between organizations in the United States and the Dominican Republic.

On 20 October 2018, the 42nd Plenary Assembly of the World Federation of United Nations Associations (WFUNA) unanimously elected him president of the global body for a 3-year renewable term thus succeeding to South Korea&#x27;s senior Ambassador Park Soo-gil and former International Atomic Energy Agency Director General, Hans Blix.
==Family and personal life==
Fernández married for the first time to Rocío Domínguez Quezada in 1987 (the daughter of Juan Domínguez and the mayoress of Jarabacoa Josefa Piedad Quezada), and had two children, Omar and Nicole. They divorced in 1996. In 2003, Fernández married Margarita Cedeño Lizardo, his former Presidential Legal Adviser and an associate attorney of his law firm, having another child, Yolanda América María. The couple divorced in 2022.

As of Fall 2022, Fernández&#x27; daughter, Nicole, was dating baseball superstar Albert Pujols.

In addition to Spanish, his mother tongue, Fernández is fluent in English and French.

Leonel Antonio Fernandez graduated with honours in law from the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo. For a while he worked as a teacher and a journalist before getting into politics. His interest in politics derived from his outstanding student leader abilities, and his dominant role in the General Secretariat of the Students&#x27; Association University of Santo Domingo. Moreover, Leonel Antonio Fernandez partook in many protests against the Balaguer regime, was a member of the Central and Political Committees of the Party of Dominican Liberation, which was founded by Juan Bosch. He began expanding his political interests and won Presidency in the Dominican Republic in 1996.

<text>Te Kauparenui / Gowan River is in the South Island of New Zealand. Its source is at Lake Rotoroa and travels 11 kilometres before feeding into the Buller River. Mixed farming and forestry occurs on both banks of the river. The river has introduced trout which attracts recreational fishing.

In 2001 a Water Conservation Order was placed on the river to recognise the value of it in an unmodified state. An application was made by Majac Trust to change the Order so that a hydroelectric electricity scheme could be constructed on the river. This was rejected by the Environment Court in August 2007.

In August 2014, the name of the river was officially altered to Te Kauparenui / Gowan River. In 1843, Charles Heaphy named the river after James Robert Gowen, one the New Zealand Company directors, but misspelled the name as &quot;Gowan&quot; in his 1846 journal, and the latter spelling has since prevailed.

<doc id="653312" wikidata="Q16002739" url="?curid=653312" title="AM stereo">
<text>AM stereo is a term given to a series of mutually incompatible techniques for radio broadcasting stereo audio in the AM band in a manner that is compatible with standard AM receivers. There are two main classes of systems: independent sideband (ISB) systems, promoted principally by American broadcast engineer Leonard R. Kahn; and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) multiplexing systems (conceptually closer to FM stereo).

Initially adopted by many commercial AM broadcasters in the mid to late 1980s, AM stereo broadcasting soon began to decline due to a lack of receivers (most &quot;AM/FM stereo&quot; radios only receive in stereo on FM), a growing exodus of music broadcasters to FM, concentration of ownership of the few remaining stations in the hands of large corporations and the removal of music from AM stations in favor of news/talk or sports broadcasting. By 2001, most of the former AM stereo broadcasters were no longer stereo or had left the AM band entirely.

==History==
Early experiments with stereo AM radio involved two separate stations (both AM or sometimes one AM and one FM) broadcasting the left and right audio channels. This system was not very practical, as it required the listener to use two separate receivers. Synchronization was problematic, often resulting in &quot;ping-pong&quot; effects between the two channels. Reception was also likely to be different between the two stations, and many listeners used mismatching models of receivers.

After the early experiments with two stations, a number of systems were invented to broadcast a stereo signal in a way which was compatible with standard AM receivers.

FM stereo was first implemented in 1961. In the United States, FM overtook AM as the dominant broadcast radio band in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

===Timeline===
* 1924: WPAJ (now WDRC) broadcast in stereo from New Haven, Connecticut, using two transmitters: one on 1120 kHz and the other on 1320 kHz. However stereo separation was poor, to preserve compatibility for mono listeners.
* In the 1950s, several AM stereo systems were proposed (including the original RCA AM/FM system which later became the Belar system in the 1970s) but the FCC did not propose any standard as AM was still dominant over FM at the time.
* 1960: AM stereo first demonstrated on XETRA-AM, Tijuana, Mexico, using the Kahn independent sideband system.
* 1963: WHAZ runs a stereo program on eight AM stations, four on each channel.
* 1980: After five years of testing the five systems, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) selected the Magnavox system as the official AM stereo standard. The FCC&#x27;s research is immediately accused of being flawed and incomplete.
* 1982: After a series of lawsuits and accusations, the FCC decides to let the marketplace decide and revokes the Magnavox certification as the AM stereo standard for political reasons. Belar had dropped out of the AM stereo race due to receiver distortion problems, leaving Motorola C-QUAM, Harris Corporation, Magnavox, and the Kahn/Hazeltine independent sideband system.
* 1984: General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, and a number of import automakers begin installing C-QUAM AM stereo receivers in automobiles, beginning with the 1985 model year. Harris Corporation abandons its AM stereo system and puts its support behind C-QUAM (Harris continues to manufacture C-QUAM equipment today).
* 1985: AM stereo broadcasting officially begins in Australia, with the C-QUAM standard.
* 1988: Canada and Mexico adopt C-QUAM as their standard for AM stereo.
* 1992: Japan adopts C-QUAM as its standard for AM stereo.
* 1993: The FCC makes C-QUAM the AM stereo standard for stations in the U.S., and also grants &quot;stereo preference&quot; for radio stations requesting to move to the AM expanded band (1610–1700 kHz), although such stations have never actually been required to transmit in stereo.
* 1993: The AMAX certification program begins. This was to set an official manufacturing standard for high-quality AM radio receivers, with a wider audio bandwidth for higher fidelity reception of strong signals, and optionally C-QUAM AM stereo. Despite the availability of AMAX receivers from companies like Sony, General Electric, Denon, and AMAX-certified car radios from the domestic and Japanese automakers, most electronics manufacturers did not wish to implement the more costly AMAX tuner design in their radios, so most AM radios today remain in mono with limited fidelity.
* 2006 to present: AM stereo gains new life through the support for C-QUAM decoding in most receivers designed for HD Radio. These new digital radios receive AM stereo signals, although the AM transmitters are now limited to 10 kHz audio bandwidth and the HD receivers flip left and right channels in decoding C-QUAM stereo.

==Broadcasting systems==
The Magnavox PMX, Harris Corporation V-CPM, and Motorola C-QUAM (Compatible—Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) were all based around modulating the phase and amplitude of the carrier, placing the stereo information in the phase modulated portion, while the standard mono (L+R) information is in the amplitude modulation. The systems all did this in similar (but not completely compatible) ways. As with FM stereo, all of the AM stereo designs used pilot tones (unheard parts of the broadcast signal) to alert the receiver electronics that a stereo signal was coming in and to switch the receiver into the proper decoding mode. The original Harris Corporation system was later changed to match the Motorola C-QUAM pilot tone for indicating the station was in stereo, thus making it compatible with all C-QUAM receivers.

===Harris System===
This system, known as V-CPM for Variable Angle Compatible Phase Multiplex, was developed by Harris Corporation, a major manufacturer of radio/TV transmitters. It incorporated a left minus right component which was frequency modulated by about 1 kHz. Harris is the successor to the pioneer Gates radio line, which has changed its name in 2014 to Gates-Air. The Harris system eventually changed their pilot tone to be compatible with C-QUAM, after C-QUAM became the more popular and eventually, the FCC approved standard. CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, Canada (also serving nearby Detroit, Michigan) was among the first stations to broadcast in Harris AM stereo. The Harris system is currently no longer used in its original form.

===Magnavox System===
This system was developed by electronics manufacturer, Magnavox. It is a phase modulation system. It was initially declared the AM stereo standard by the FCC in 1980, but the FCC later declared that stations were free to choose any system. As with the Harris system, it was popular in the 1980s, but most stations stopped broadcasting in stereo, or changed to the C-QUAM system as time went on. 1190 WOWO in Fort Wayne, Indiana was the (then) 50,000-watt clear channel Magnavox flagship station.

===Motorola C-QUAM===
C-QUAM was developed and promoted primarily by Motorola, a longtime manufacturer of two-way radio equipment. It became the dominant system by the late 1980s, and was declared the official standard by the FCC in 1993. While many stations in the USA have since discontinued broadcasting in stereo, many still have the necessary equipment to do so. C-QUAM is still popular in some other parts of the world where it was declared the official standard such as Canada, Japan, and Australia.

The C-QUAM exciter replaces the crystal stage in an AM transmitter. The C-QUAM signal, consists of a phase modulated portion which is made up of both the L+R and L-R audio information and a conventional L+R (mono) portion, which is amplitude modulated. C-QUAM is a modified form of quadrature modulation in that the phase modulated audio consists of both the L+R and L-R portions, modulated 90 degrees out of phase with each other.

Including the L+R audio in the phase modulated portion of the signal is the very reason the C-QUAM method of AM Stereo is, as the name implies, 100% compatible with mono AM radios. This technique resolves a distortion issue which arises when left only or right only audio is transmitted using a basic L-R quadrature modulation approach.

C-QUAM had been long criticized by the Kahn-Hazeltine system&#x27;s creator, Leonard Kahn as being inferior to his system. First generation C-QUAM receivers suffered from &quot;platform motion&quot; effects when listening to stations received via skywave. Later improvements by Motorola minimized the platform motion effect and increased audio quality and stereo separation, especially on AMAX-certified receivers in the 1990s.

===Kahn-Hazeltine===
The Kahn-Hazeltine system also called ISB was developed by American engineer Leonard R. Kahn and the Hazeltine Corporation. This system used an entirely different principle—using independently modulated upper and lower sidebands. While a station using the system would sound best with proper decoding, it was also possible to use two standard AM radios (one tuned above and the other below the primary carrier) to achieve the stereophonic effect, although with poor stereo separation and fidelity compared to a proper Kahn system AM stereo receiver. One of the best known stations to use the Kahn system was 890/WLS, Chicago. WLS later used the Motorola C-QUAM system instead before reverting to mono.

However, the Kahn system suffered from lower stereo separation above 5 kHz (reaching none at 7 kHz whereas FM stereo has 40 dB or more separation at 15 kHz) and the radio antenna array on directional AM (common on a lot of nighttime and some daytime stations) had to have a flat response across the entire 20 kHz AM channel. If the array had a higher reactance value (leading to a higher Standing wave ratio) on one side of the frequency vs the other, it would affect the audio response of that channel and thus the stereo signal would be affected. Also, Kahn refused to license any radio receivers manufacturers with his design, although multi-system receivers were manufactured by various companies such as Sony, Sansui, and Sanyo, which could receive any of the four AM stereo systems.

Nonetheless, this system remained competitive with C-QUAM into the late 1980s and Kahn was very vocal about its advantages over Motorola&#x27;s system. Kahn filed a lawsuit claiming that the Motorola system did not meet FCC emission bandwidth specifications, but by that time, C-QUAM had already been declared as the single standard for AM stereo in the USA.

Kahn&#x27;s AM stereo design was later revamped for monaural use and used in the Power-Side system, in which a decreased signal in one sideband is used to improve coverage and loudness, especially with directional antenna arrays. Power-Side became the basis for CAM-D, Compatible AM Digital, a new digital system being promoted by Leonard Kahn and used on several AM stations.

Kahn receiver chips have also been used as an inexpensive method for providing high frequency (world band) receivers with synchronous detection technology.

===Belar System===
The Belar system was used in limited number of stations, such as WJR. The Belar system, originally designed by RCA in the 1950s, was a simple FM/AM modulation system, with an attenuated L-R signal frequency modulating the carrier (with a 400 μs pre-emphasis) in the extent of +/- 320 Hz around the center frequency, and the L+R doing the normal &quot;high level&quot; AM modulation (usually referred to as plate modulation in transmitters using a tube in the final stage, where the audio is applied to the plate voltage of the tube; in solid state transmitters, various different techniques are available that are more efficient at lower power levels). The Belar system (by the company of the same name) was dropped due to issues with its design though it was much easier to implement than the other systems. It and the Kahn system did not suffer from platform motion (platform motion is where the stereo balance would shift from one side to the other and then back to center) but the use of low level frequency modulation did not permit a high separation of L and R channels.

==Adoption in the United States==
In 1975, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) started a series of five-year tests to determine which of the five competing standards would be selected. By the end of the testing period, the Belar system was dropped. In April 1980, the FCC announced that the Magnavox system would become the standard. This announcement was met with harsh criticism and a series of lawsuits. In September 1980, the FCC rescinded its decision on Magnavox and started all over again, putting two senior technical consultants to work on the problem full-time for five months. On March 4, 1982, the FCC decided to let the marketplace decide, meaning that all four standards were allowed. After the 1982 decision, many stations implemented one of the four standards. Initially, all systems remained competitive, but by the later 1980s, Motorola C-QUAM had a clear majority of stations and receivers. Around this same time, Harris Corporation dropped their system and instead endorsed C-QUAM. During this time, radio manufactures either made receivers which decoded just one system, or decoded all four. The multiple systems used greatly confused consumers and severely impacted consumer adoption. As a result of this confusion, and the continued growth of the FM band, interest in AM stereo dwindled.

In 1993, the FCC declared Motorola&#x27;s C-QUAM system the standard. To ensure that all AM stereo receivers maintained the same sound quality, the National Association of Broadcasters and the Electronic Industries Association started the AMAX certification program.

==Global adoption==
In the early 1980s, other countries, most notably Canada, Australia and Japan approved and implemented AM stereo systems. Most governments approved a single standard, usually Motorola&#x27;s C-QUAM, which greatly reduced confusion and increased user adoption.

Following the launch of the American-owned, ship-based pirate radio station Laser 558 off the British coast, there were announcements that another such station, provisionally called Stereo Hits 576, would soon follow, using AM stereo on an adjacent frequency to Laser. Nothing ever came of this project and 576 kHz was adopted by Radio Caroline instead.

In many countries where the AM band was still dominant, AM stereo radios continued to be manufactured and marketed, and stations still broadcast stereo signals; the last C-QUAM compatible models to be produced were Sony Japan&#x27;s SRF-A300 portable model, discontinued in 2011, and Pioneer&#x27;s F-D3 tuner for component audio, discontinued in 2013. 

==Current status==
Globally, interest in and use of AM stereo has been declining steadily since the 1990s, as many music stations have continued to move to the FM band. As a result, the vast majority of AM stations broadcast news/talk or sports/sports talk formats. Many of the stations that initially implemented AM stereo are clear-channel 50,000-watt stations, and are more concerned with listening range than stereo sound (although there is no proof that use of AM stereo affects listening range). As a result, these stations still have the necessary equipment to broadcast in stereo, but it is left unused (or converted to HD Radio). Also, many former AM stereo stations were bought up by broadcasting conglomerates, which generally discourage AM stereo broadcasting. In the United States, most stations currently using AM stereo are small, independently owned and broadcast a variety of music format. Some of the Radio Disney AM stations was broadcast in stereo.

* United States: For a list of stations, see ().
* Japan: Between 1992 and 1996, 16 commercial broadcasting companies in Japan adopted C-QUAM because of the narrow Japanese FM band, which at the time covered only 14 MHz (76-90 MHz), as opposed to the 20.5 MHz used in the rest of the world (87.5-108 MHz). However, it is now quite rare to see AM radios with the stereo function at appliance stores in Japan because of the decline in AM stereo stations and the limited available area, mainly in densely populated areas. 14 of the 16 stereo stations have since reverted to mono, 12 since the start of 2010 (:ja:AMステレオ放送), leaving only 2 stations, Radio Osaka and Wakayama Broadcasting System (:ja:和歌山放送), broadcasting in stereo on AM. Also, it was decided in 2021 to transition most AM commercial stations to FM by 2028, due to an expansion of the FM band by 5 MHz (90-95 MHz) to provide for FM relays of those stations.
* Australia: AM stereo was popular in Australia because AM covers a wide geographic area compared to FM, in addition to the government&#x27;s adoption of a single standard (Motorola C-QUAM) several years sooner than the USA, and Australia&#x27;s relatively late adoption of FM (the frequencies in the FM band were originally allocated for TV). As of June 2008 no Melbourne AM stations broadcast C-QUAM AM stereo. At its peak popularity in the late 1980s the majority of stations did. Currently, 4WK is the only station that broadcasts AM stereo in Australia.
* Europe: After some experiments in the 1980s, AM stereo was deemed to be unsuitable for the crowded band conditions and narrow bandwidths associated with AM broadcasting in Europe. However, Motorola C-QUAM AM stereo remains in use today on a handful of stations in Italy and Greece. France Bleu broadcast in AM stereo until the closure of its AM network in 2019.
* Canada: AM stereo was more widely adopted in Canada than in the USA. This may have been due to the Canadian government&#x27;s decision to use a single standard, and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) licensing stations by format and their hit/non-hit rules for FM (hence, more music stations on AM). However, unlike in the USA, some former AM stereo stations have moved to the FM band and left the AM band altogether instead of simply reverting to mono.
* Brazil: AM stereo was considered in the 90s, however it never was implemented because of economic reasons.

==Surround sound==
On February 26, 2010, KCJJ (AM 1630) in Coralville, Iowa, aired a four-hour quadraphonic radio broadcast of the Robb Spewak show. The show spotlighted music from the quadraphonic era on the 40th anniversary of the format&#x27;s release in America and was engineered by Tab Patterson. All the music was from discrete 4-channel tapes, then encoded into Dolby Pro-Logic II and transmitted using their stereo C-QUAM transmitter.

==Decline in use==
Radio stations around the world are converting to various systems of digital radio, such as Digital Radio Mondiale, DAB or HD Radio (in the United States). Some of these digital radio systems, most notably HD Radio have &quot;hybrid modes&quot; which let a station broadcast a standard AM signal along with the digital information. While these transmission modes allow standard AM, they are not compatible with any AM stereo system (meaning both cannot be broadcast at the same time).

<doc id="653313" wikidata="Q5644418" url="?curid=653313" title="Hamdi v. Rumsfeld">
<text>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court recognized the power of the U.S. government to detain enemy combatants, including U.S. citizens, but ruled that detainees who are U.S. citizens must have the rights of due process, and the ability to challenge their enemy combatant status before an impartial authority.

It reversed the dismissal by a lower court of a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition brought on behalf of Yaser Esam Hamdi, a U.S. citizen who was being detained indefinitely as an illegal enemy combatant after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001. Following the court&#x27;s decision, on October 9, 2004, the U.S. government released Hamdi without charge and deported him to Saudi Arabia, where his family lived and he had grown up, on the condition that he renounce his U.S. citizenship, commit to travel prohibitions and other conditions.

== Background ==
===Early life and capture===

Yaser Esam Hamdi was born in Louisiana as a citizen of the United States in 1980. That same year, he and his family moved to Saudi Arabia.

According to his father, Hamdi went to Afghanistan in the late summer of 2001 as a relief worker. He was then captured less than two months after his arrival by the Afghan Northern Alliance. They turned him over to U.S. military authorities during the U.S. invasion. He was classified as an enemy combatant by the U.S. armed forces and detained in connection with ongoing hostilities.

Hamdi&#x27;s father claimed that Hamdi had gone to Afghanistan to do relief work and was trapped there when the U.S. invasion began, citing his young age and lack of travel experience as reasons for his being trapped.

===Detention and legal challenge===
After his capture in 2001, Hamdi was detained and interrogated in Afghanistan. In January 2002, the Americans transferred Hamdi to Guantanamo Bay. In April 2002, when officials discovered that he held U.S. (as well as Saudi) citizenship, they transferred him to a Naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia and finally to the Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston, South Carolina. In June 2002, Hamdi&#x27;s father, Esam Fouad Hamdi, filed a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to challenge his detention.

The Bush administration claimed that because Hamdi was caught in arms against the U.S., he could be properly detained as an enemy combatant, without any oversight of presidential decision making, and without access to an attorney or the court system. The administration argued that this power was constitutional and necessary to effectively fight the War on Terror, declared by the Congress of the United States in the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The government used its detention authority to ensure that terrorists were no longer a threat while active combat operations continued and to ensure suspects could be fully interrogated.

===District case===
Judge Robert G. Doumar ruled that Hamdi&#x27;s father was a proper &quot;next friend&quot; having standing to sue on behalf of his son, and ordered that a federal public defender be given access to Hamdi. On appeal, however, the Fourth Circuit reversed the District Court&#x27;s order, ruling that the District Court had failed to give proper deference to the government&#x27;s &quot;intelligence and security interests,&quot; and that it should proceed with a properly deferential investigation.

The case was sent back to the District Court, which denied the government&#x27;s motion to dismiss Hamdi&#x27;s petition. Judge Doumar found the government&#x27;s evidence supporting Hamdi&#x27;s detention &quot;woefully inadequate,&quot; and based predominantly on hearsay and bare assertions. The District Court ordered the government to produce numerous documents for in camera review by the court that would enable it to perform a &quot;meaningful judicial review,&quot; such as the statements by the Northern Alliance regarding Hamdi&#x27;s capture, the dates and circumstances of his capture and interrogations, and a list of all the officials involved in the determination of his &quot;enemy combatant&quot; status.

=== Appellate case ===
The government appealed Judge Doumar&#x27;s order to produce the evidence, and the Fourth Circuit again reversed the District Court. Because it was &quot;undisputed that Hamdi was captured in a zone of active combat in a foreign theater of conflict,&quot; the Fourth Circuit said that it was not proper for any court to hear a challenge of his status. It ruled that the broad warmaking powers delegated to the President under Article Two of the United States Constitution and the principle of separation of powers prohibited courts from interfering in this vital area of national security.

After the Fourth Circuit denied a petition for rehearing &quot;en banc&quot;, Hamdi&#x27;s father appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. It granted &quot;certiorari&quot; review and reversed the Fourth Circuit&#x27;s ruling. Hamdi was represented before the Court by the late Federal Public Defender Frank W. Dunham, Jr., and the Government&#x27;s side was argued by the Principal Deputy Solicitor General, Paul Clement.

== Opinion of the Court ==
Though no single opinion of the Court commanded a majority, six of the nine justices of the Court agreed that the executive branch does not have the power to hold a U.S. citizen indefinitely without basic due process protections enforceable through judicial review.

=== Plurality opinion ===
Justice O&#x27;Connor wrote a plurality opinion representing the Court&#x27;s judgment, which was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Breyer and Kennedy. O&#x27;Connor wrote that although Congress had expressly authorized the detention of enemy combatants in its Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed after 9/11, due process required that Hamdi have a meaningful opportunity to challenge his enemy combatant status.

Justice O&#x27;Connor used the three-part test of &quot;Mathews v. Eldridge&quot; to limit the due process to be received. This required notice of the charges and an opportunity to be heard, though because of the burden of ongoing military conflict upon the executive, normal procedural protections, such as placing the burden of proof on the government or the ban on hearsay, need not apply. O&#x27;Connor suggested the Department of Defense create fact-finding tribunals similar to the AR 190-8 to determine whether a detainee merited continued detention as an enemy combatant.

In response, the United States Department of Defense created Combatant Status Review Tribunals, modeling them after the AR 190-8. O&#x27;Connor did not write at length on Hamdi&#x27;s right to an attorney, because by the time the Court rendered its decision, Hamdi had been granted access to one. But O&#x27;Connor wrote that Hamdi &quot;unquestionably has the right to access to counsel in connection with the proceedings on remand.&quot; The plurality held that judges need not be involved in reviewing these cases, rather only that an &quot;impartial decision maker&quot; was required. Justice O&#x27;Connor also limited the reach of the Court&#x27;s conclusion regarding the executive authority to detain enemy combatants:

The plurality asserted that the Judiciary must not defer to the executive with respect to detentions. Instead the constitution empowers the judiciary to act as a check on executive power in this realm. Justice O&#x27;Connor wrote:

=== Souter concurrence and dissent===
Justice David Souter, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, concurred with the plurality&#x27;s judgment that due process protections must be available for Hamdi to challenge his status and detention, providing a majority for that part of the ruling. However, he dissented from the plurality&#x27;s ruling that AUMF established Congressional authorization for the detention of enemy combatants.

=== Scalia dissent ===
Justice Antonin Scalia&#x27;s dissent, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, went the furthest in restricting the executive power of detention. Scalia asserted that based on historical precedent, the government had two options to detain Hamdi: Congress could suspend the right to &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, or Hamdi could be tried under normal criminal law. Scalia wrote that the plurality, though well-meaning, had no basis in law for trying to establish new procedures that would be applicable in a challenge to Hamdi&#x27;s detention – it was only the job of the Court to declare it unconstitutional and order his release or proper arrest, rather than to invent an acceptable process for detention. Scalia and Stevens also suggested that there is a time-limited exception to the ancient right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;:
Where the commitment was for felony or high treason, the did not require immediate release, but instead required the Crown to commence criminal proceedings within a specified time…. [T]he practical effect of this provision was that imprisonment without indictment or trial for felony or high treason under §7 would not exceed approximately three to six months.

=== Thomas dissent ===
Justice Clarence Thomas was the only justice who sided entirely with the executive branch and the Fourth Circuit&#x27;s ruling, based on his view of the security interests at stake and the President&#x27;s broad war-making powers. Thomas wrote that the Court&#x27;s rationale would also require due process rights for bombing targets: &quot;Because a decision to bomb a particular target might extinguish life interests, the plurality&#x27;s analysis seems to require notice to potential targets.&quot; Thomas also wrote that Congress intended that the AUMF authorize such detentions. Thomas would later make use of this dissent in &quot;Turner v. Rogers&quot; in 2011.

== Subsequent developments ==
Although by the terms used in the Court&#x27;s holdings, they were apparently limited to &quot;citizen-detainees,&quot; the last paragraph of section III, D of the O&#x27;Connor plurality (four justices: O&#x27;Connor, Rehnquist, Kennedy, and Breyer) relies on the Geneva Convention and states that &quot;habeas corpus&quot; should be available to an &quot;alleged enemy combatant.&quot;

On the same day, the Court held in &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot; (2004) that U.S. courts have jurisdiction to hear &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions filed by the Guantanamo detainees, and other foreign nationals.

The government conceded that some very limited due process rights, allowing for hearings to determine the detainees&#x27; status as enemy combatants and the right to legal counsel, would be extended to all of the Guantanamo detainees, citizen and non-citizen alike. The application of the Court&#x27;s decisions in these cases is consistent with the fact that the other two justices in the &quot;Hamdi&quot; majority, as well as two of the dissenting justices (Scalia and Stevens), were more restrictive in their willingness to concede any of the detention powers requested by the government for Guantanamo detainees in the &quot;Hamdi&quot; case.

In regard to the detention of detainees without charge, in section I of the O&#x27;Connor plurality opinion, the plurality relied on the time-honored traditions of war, the Geneva Convention, and a long list of other international treaties, to hold that the government had authority under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (2001) to hold any enemy combatants, provided enemy combatants had been seized on the battlefield participating in active hostilities, for the sole objective of preventing an enemy combatant from returning to the battlefield, and then only so long as there continued to be &quot;active hostilities.&quot; The plurality held that such protective detention could be applied to both citizen and non-citizen enemy combatants.

The plurality opinion stated:

The U.S. government had argued that it had the right to detain enemy combatants indefinitely for the two purposes of interrogation and to prevent a return to the battlefield. Justice O&#x27;Connor rejected the first purpose by stating definitively that &quot;indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.&quot; With regard to the second purpose, the plurality held &quot;Necessary and appropriate force&quot; amounted to authorization to detain &quot;for the duration of the relevant conflict,&quot; in order to prevent enemy combatants from rejoining the fight.

Of the four justices outside the plurality, Justices Ginsburg and Souter limited their opinions to their position that Section 4001(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code (the Non-Detention Act; enacted to prevent the sort of detention that occurred when the United States placed Japanese-American citizens in concentration camps during World War II), prevented the detention of U.S. citizens. Justice Scalia (whose opinion was joined by Justice Stevens), restricted his holding to citizen-detainees and implied that anyone held outside of United States&#x27; territory might be beyond the reach of the Court altogether. Again, the &quot;Rasul&quot; case did not directly address the detention issue, and any hearings would be limited to the determination of enemy combatant status.

* In &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; (2006), the Court decided that the &quot;military commissions&quot; created to try unlawful combatants for war crimes suffered from certain fatal procedural defects under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Convention, and were without other legal authority to proceed. They overruled Congress&#x27; attempt to deprive the Court of jurisdiction to decide that issue by passing the Detainee Treatment Act. Justices in the majority (particularly Justices Kennedy and Breyer) disagreed with Justice Stevens as to whether the &quot;charge&quot; of conspiracy could be maintained to justify the determination of unlawful combatant status. Although the Court struck down the military commissions as created by the Executive Branch, they did not provide the detainees with direct access to the federal courts, but only with access to a fair and impartial hearing to a tribunal constitutionally authorized by Congress and proceeding with certain due process guarantees (such as one operated under terms similar to those provided by Article I courts under the UCMJ or according to the terms of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949).
*On October 17, 2006, the president signed the Military Commissions Act, passed by Congress and authorizing a type of military tribunal to be used at Guantanamo Bay detention camp, as requested by the Bush administration. That fall, the administration transferred fourteen high-value detainees to Guantanamo Bay from black sites overseas.
* In &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot; (2008), the Court ruled that detainees, and other foreign nationals, do have the right to direct access to federal courts to challenge their detentions.

<doc id="653318" wikidata="Q1606448" url="?curid=653318" title="Henry Arthur Jones">
<text>Henry Arthur Jones (20 September 1851 – 7 January 1929) was an English dramatist, who was first noted for his melodrama &quot;The Silver King&quot; (1882), and went on to write prolifically, often appearing to mirror Ibsen from the opposite (conservative) viewpoint. As a right-winger, he engaged in extensive debates with left-wing writers such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells.

==Biography==

Jones was born at Granborough, Buckinghamshire, to Silvanus Jones, a farmer. Until he was 13, he attended Grace&#x27;s Classical and Commercial Academy in Winslow, where he inherited property on his father&#x27;s death in 1914. He began to earn his living early, his spare time being given to literary pursuits.

==Career overview==

He was twenty-seven before his first piece, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Round the Corner&quot;, was produced at the Exeter Theatre, but within four years of his debut as a dramatist he scored a great success with &quot;The Silver King&quot; (November 1882), written with Henry Herman, a melodrama produced by Wilson Barrett at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, London. Its financial success enabled the author to write a play &quot;to please himself&quot;.

&quot;Saints and Sinners&quot; (1884), which ran for two hundred nights, placed on the stage a picture of middle-class life and religion in a country town, and the introduction of the religious element raised considerable outcry. The author defended himself in an article published in the &quot;Nineteenth Century&quot; (January 1885), taking for his starting-point a quotation from the preface to Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot;. His next serious pieces, &quot;The Middleman&quot; (1889) and &quot;Judah&quot; (1890), established his reputation.

His plays have been given a total of 28 productions on Broadway, the most recent in 1928 (&quot;Mrs Dane&#x27;s Defence&quot;).

A uniform edition of his plays began to be issued in 1891. His views of dramatic art were expressed from time to time in lectures and essays, collected in 1895 as &quot;The Renaissance of the English Drama&quot;.

He also published essays on patriotism and on education, and in the early 1920s some vigorous political polemics, described below.

==Criticism of his plays==

===In his lifetime===

&quot;There are three rules for writing plays,&quot; said Oscar Wilde. &quot;The first rule is not to write like Henry Arthur Jones; the second and third rules are the same.&quot; This comic belittling is prompted by Wilde&#x27;s aloof attitude in distancing himself from the foibles of the middle and higher classes, as opposed to Jones&#x27; method of realistic observations (from his viewpoint) on the way ordinary people act, though mainly emphasizing faults and weaknesses.

===Posterity===


Although often treating similar subjects and with a similar realistic style as Henrik Ibsen, Jones is much less well known. One reason is his lack of deep psychological insight characteristic of the Norwegian master. Jones&#x27; dramatic characters are mostly one-sided. Another factor is Jones&#x27; conservative-minded attitude, as opposed to the liberal-minded Ibsen. Jones&#x27; comedies such as &quot;The Liars&quot; and &quot;Joseph Entangled&quot; have a slack construction, both tediously drawn out from a premise whereby a non-adulterous couple is caught in a compromising situation. In contrast, his dramas such as &quot;The Hypocrites&quot;, &quot;The Lie&quot;, and &quot;Mrs Dane&#x27;s Defence&quot; have a tight construction with some striking scenes. The action in either style mostly represents ordinary people in conflict over amorous relations. Men often appear selfish, narrow-minded, and brutish, but sometimes uncompromising and brave. Women often appear frightened, especially whenever threatened to be exposed to social ostracism, but most often loyal and sensitive. Either sex often loses their heads whenever in the throes of love. There is often a male authoritative figure who sums up the situation in the final act, whose views are rarely or never challenged, such as Sir Daniel in &quot;Mrs Dane&#x27;s Defence&quot; and Sir Richard in &quot;The Case of Rebellious Susan&quot;. The latter advises in this way a feminist who has incited female workers to strike: &quot;At her own fireside, there is an immense future for women as wives and mothers, and a very limited future for them in any other capacity. While you ladies without passions – or with distorted and defeated passions – are raving and trumpeting all over the country, that wise, grim, old grandmother of us all, Dame Nature, is simply laughing up her sleeve and snapping her fingers at you and your new epochs and new movements. Go home!&quot; Occasionally, there is a character who defies the views of most of the rest, such as Mr Linnell, the curate in &quot;The Hypocrites&quot;, which concerns the conflict between religious principles and money.

==His criticisms of other people&#x27;s plays==

In his old age, Jones remarked that &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; by Henrik Ibsen should have ended with Helmer &#x27;pouring himself a stiff glass of whisky and water and lifting it reverently toward Heaven exclaiming &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m well rid of her&quot;&#x27;.

==Political writings==

Later in his life Henry Arthur Jones wrote a series of non-fiction articles &quot;arguing from the right against H.G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw&quot;. Jones&#x27; non-fiction also expressed his opposition to Communism and the Soviet Union.

One such work was &quot;My Dear Wells: a Manual for Haters of England&quot; (1921), a collection of open letters to H. G. Wells originally published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. A sample of this work: &quot;You unreservedly condemn and ridicule the cardinal Marxian doctrines. In this matter I congratulate you upon being in the company of thinkers of a higher cast than your usual associates and disciples. You tell us that although Marxian communism is stupidly, blindly wrong and mischievous, you have an admiration and friendship for the men who have imposed it upon the Russian people to the infinite misery and impoverishment of the land.&quot;

Wells repeatedly declined to respond, as in this letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in 1921: &quot;I do not believe that Mr. Jones has ever read a line that I have written. But he goes on unquenchably, a sort of endless hooting. I would as soon argue with some tiresome, remote and inattentive foghorn&quot;; and later, in 1926, in the preface to &quot;Mr Belloc Objects&quot;: &quot;For years I have failed to respond to Mr. Henry Arthur Jones, who long ago invented a set of opinions for me and invited me to defend them with an enviable persistence and vigour. Occasionally I may have corrected some too gross public mis-statement about me – too often I fear with the acerbity of the inexperienced.&quot;

Another sample of Henry Arthur Jones&#x27; political writing is his response to George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s anti-war manifesto &quot;Common Sense About the War&quot;: &quot;The hag Sedition was your mother, and Perversity begot you. Mischief was your midwife and Misrule your nurse, and Unreason brought you up at her feet – no other ancestry and rearing had you, you freakish homunculus, germinated outside of lawful procreation.&quot;

== Personal life ==
On 2 September 1875 Henry Arthur Jones married Jane Eliza Seeley (1855–1924) at St. Andrews Church, Holborn. They had six children:

* Winifred Amy (1880–1956), who married and divorced actor Leslie Faber.
* Ethelwyne Sylvia (1883–1948), became an actress and performed in some of her father&#x27;s plays, married and divorced M. V. Leveaux, and married Angus McDonnell (1881–1966), son of the Earl of Antrim, in 1913. She also had an eight-year-long affair with W. Somerset Maugham, culminating in her rejection of his marriage proposal. &quot;The great love of Maugham&#x27;s life was undoubtedly the warm, gentle, maternal, sexy Sue Jones.&quot;
* Gertrude (Jill) Mary, (1884–1967) married Irving Albery (1879–1967) a Conservative MP and the son of actress and theatrical manager Mary Moore (later Lady Wyndham) and dramatist James Albery. Their daughter Jessica Mary Albery (1908–90) was one of Britain&#x27;s first female professional architects; they also two sons Michael James Albery (1910–75), a barrister, father of chemist Wyndham John Albery; and Peter James Albery (1912–79)
* Jenny Doris Thorne (1888–1947) became her father&#x27;s biographer; she married and divorced William Hobart Houghton Thorne. 
* Lucien David Silvanus (1894–1947)
* Oliver Stacey Arthur (1899–1977); married Louisa Ena Ackerman in 1929.

<doc id="653320" wikidata="Q8045218" url="?curid=653320" title="Xue">
<text>Xue () is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese surname 薛 (Xuē). It is romanized as Hsüeh in Wade-Giles. In Hong Kong and Macau it is usually romanized through its Cantonese pronunciation Sit. In Korean, it corresponds to [[Seol (Korean name)|Seol]] (설), in Japanese to Setsu and in Vietnamese to Tiết. in Indonesia and Netherlands, it is commonly spelled as Siek. According to the 2010 Chinese Census, it is the 76th most common surname in China, a sharp decline from 48th in 1982. In a study by geneticist Yuan Yida on the distribution of Chinese surnames, people who carry the name Xue are dispersed throughout the country and is most heavily concentrated in Shanxi.

==Origin==
The surname traces back to the State of Xue in what is modern day Shandong. Yu the Great (大禹), founding emperor of the Xia dynasty, bestowed upon his minister Xi Zhong the title Marquis of Xue in gratitude for his invention of the Chinese chariot; Xi Zhong&#x27;s descendants subsequently bore Xue as their clan name.

Sinicized descendants of various non-Han Chinese peoples also adopted Xue as their surname, including the Turkic Tiele Xueyantuo tribe, the Xianbei Chigan clan and several Manchu clans such as Sakda Hala, Sue Hala, Sunit Hala etc.

==In literature==
In the classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin, the Xue family is one of the four noble families of Jinling. The socially graceful debutante Xue Baochai, a literary embodiment of ideal traditional Chinese femininity, is one of the principal characters in the novel.

<text>James Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Hurley (15 October 1885 – 16 January 1962) was an Australian photographer and adventurer. He participated in a number of expeditions to Antarctica and served as an official photographer with Australian forces during both world wars. He was the official photographer for the Australasian Antarctic Expedition and the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–16.

His artistic style produced many memorable images. He also used staged scenes, composites and photographic manipulation.

== Early life ==
Frank Hurley was the third of five children to parents Edward and Margaret Hurley and was raised in Glebe, a suburb of Sydney, Australia. He ran away from home at 13 to work on the Lithgow steel mill, returning home two years later to study at the local technical school and attend science lectures at the University of Sydney.

When he was 17, he bought his first camera, a 15-shilling Kodak Box Brownie which he paid for at the rate of a shilling per week. He taught himself photography and set himself up in the postcard business, where he gained a reputation for putting himself in danger to produce stunning images, including placing himself in front of an oncoming train to capture it on film.

Hurley married Antoinette Rosalind Leighton on 11 April 1918. The couple had four children: identical twin daughters, Adelie (later a press photographer) and Toni, one son, Frank, and youngest daughter Yvonne.

== Antarctic expeditions ==
During his lifetime, Hurley spent more than four years in Antarctica. At the age of 23, in 1908, Hurley learned that Australian explorer Douglas Mawson was planning an expedition to Antarctica. Fellow Sydney-sider Henri Mallard in 1911, recommended Hurley for the position of official photographer to Mawson&#x27;s Australasian Antarctic Expedition, ahead of himself.

Hurley asserts in his biography that he then cornered Mawson as he was making his way to their interview on a train, using the advantage to talk his way into the job. Mawson was persuaded, while Mallard, who was the manager of Harringtons, a local Kodak franchise, to which Hurley was in debt, provided photographic equipment. 

Although the official photographer there were some 19 other photographers who recorded the expedition which was divided across the three separate locations. Hurley was with Mawson&#x27;s group at Cape Denison where the weather was so bad that Hurley claimed he had only ten absolutely calm days scattered throughout the year 1912-1913, and this was when he took many of his photos, making 82 photos on the first three days of September 1912. 

The expedition departed in 1911 and Hurley returned with most of the party in 1913. However Mawson was left behind as he was late returning from his sledging party, after the death of Xavier Mertz, and as a result Hurley made a second trip at the end of 1913 to pick up remaining party. On this trip he took another series of photos before returning in early 1914. On his return, he edited and released a documentary, &quot;Home of the blizzard&quot;, using his footage from the expedition.

Hurley was also the official photographer on Sir Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition which set out in 1914 and was marooned until August 1916. Hurley&#x27;s photographic kit for the expedition included the cinematograph machine, plate still camera and several smaller Kodak cameras, along with various lenses, tripods, and developing equipment, most of which had to be abandoned with the loss of their ship &quot;Endurance&quot; in 1915&quot;.&quot; He kept only a hand-held Vest Pocket Kodak camera and three rolls of film and for the rest of the expedition, he shot just 38 images. He also selected and saved 120 of his glass-plate negatives smashing about 400 remaining ones. Some of the plates from the expedition are now part of the State Library of New South Wales collection.

Hurley produced many pioneering colour images of the expedition using the then-popular Paget process of colour photography. He took photos in South Georgia in 1917. He later compiled his records into the documentary film &quot;South&quot; in 1919. His footage was also used in the 2001 IMAX film &quot;Shackleton&#x27;s Antarctic Adventure&quot;. He then returned to the Antarctic in 1929 and 1931, on Mawson&#x27;s British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition.

== World War One ==

In 1917, Hurley joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as an honorary captain, and captured many stunning battlefield scenes during the Third Battle of Ypres. In keeping with his adventurous spirit, he took considerable risks to photograph his subjects, also producing many rare panoramic and colour photographs of the conflict. Hurley kept a diary from 1917 to 1918, chronicling his time as a war photographer. In it, he described his commitment &quot;to illustrate to the public the things our fellows do and how war is conducted&quot;, and his short-lived resignation in October 1917 when he was ordered not to produce composite images—a practice that was especially popular among professional photographers at the time and one that he believed could portray the disgust and horror that he felt during the war in such a way that his audience would feel it too. His period with the AIF ended in March 1918.

===Composite Photography===

Hurley argued with superiors over the ethics of compositing photos, arguing that war was conducted on such a vast scale that it was impossible to capture the essence of it in a single negative. His motivation was to portray the disgust and horror that he felt during the war in such a way that his audience would feel it too. Some have considered the practice as an art form; others have argued that history demands the plain, simple truth. For the 1918 London exhibition, &quot;Australian War Pictures and Photographs&quot;, he employed composites for photomurals to convey drama of the war on a scale otherwise not possible using the technology available. This brought Hurley into conflict with the AIF on the grounds that montage diminished documentary value. He wrote that he would dress in civilian clothes and eavesdrop on soldiers who were visiting his exhibitions; he concluded that the composites were justified by the favourable comments they attracted. Charles Bean, official war historian, labelled Hurley&#x27;s composite images &quot;fake&quot;.
==World War Two==
Hurley again worked as an official photographer during the Second World War. He was employed by the Australian Department of Information as head of the Photographic Unit from September 1940 until early 1943, based in Cairo. He took the only film of the initial victory against the Italians at Sidi Barrani in December 1940, which was given to Cinesound and Movietone News for global release. He also covered the battle of Bardia and the Siege of Tobruk in 1941, and both of the battles at El Alamein in 1942. Several volumes of his War Diaries cover this period.

In early 1943, the AIF 9th Division was recalled to Australia to fight the Japanese forces in the Pacific theatre. Hurley resigned his position, but remained in the Middle East, and accepted the position of Middle East Director of Army Features and Propaganda Films with the British Ministry of Information. In this capacity, he travelled a reported 200,000 miles covering the region from Libya to Persia, making regular items for &quot;War Pictorial News&quot; and 2-reel features. He photographed two conferences of leaders at Cairo and Teheran in 1943. Only one diary volume survives for this period. It includes a summary of his 1943 work, and covers a four-month journey from Cairo to Teheran commencing in February 1944, during which he took footage for &quot;The Road to Russia&quot; (1944), &quot;A Day in the Life of a King&quot; (1944), possibly the first film of the Marsh Arabs &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; (1945), and one other feature about Teheran itself. Other features of this period include &quot;Cairo&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Holy Land&quot; (1945). Hurley returned to Australia in September 1946.

== Cinematography ==
Hurley also used a film camera to record a range of experiences including the Antarctic expeditions, the building of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and war in the Middle East during World War II. The camera was a Debrie Parvo L 35 mm hand-crank camera made in France. This camera is now in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.

Hurley made several documentaries throughout his career, most notably &quot;Pearls and Savages&quot; (1921). He wrote and directed several dramatic feature films, including &quot;Jungle Woman&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Hound of the Deep&quot; (1926). He also worked as cinematographer for Cinesound Productions where his best known film credits include &quot;The Squatter&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1933), &quot;The Silence of Dean Maitland&quot; (1934) and &quot;Grandad Rudd&quot; (1935).

<text>Eketāhuna is a small rural settlement, in the south of the Tararua District and the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island.

The town is located at eastern foot of the Tararua Ranges, 35 kilometres north of Masterton and a similar distance south of Palmerston North. It is situated on State Highway 2, on the eastern bank of the Mākākahi River.

Eketāhuna has become synonymous with stereotypes of remote rural New Zealand towns, with New Zealanders colloquially referring to the town in the same way other English speakers refer to Timbuktu.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;land on the sandbank&quot; for &quot;Eketāhuna&quot;. When pronounced in the typical Pākehā way, the name sounds like the Afrikaans sentence &quot;I have a chicken&quot; (), making it amusing to immigrant Afrikaans-speaking South Africans in New Zealand.

<text>Fort Verde State Historic Park in the town of Camp Verde, Arizona is a small park that attempts to preserve parts of the Apache Wars-era fort as it appeared in the 1880s. The park was established in 1970 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places a year later.

Fort Verde was established at its current location in 1871. It is significant as &quot;the best preserved and least altered of any military post associated with General Crook’s 1872-73 campaign against the northern Apaches.&quot;

Settlers in the mid-19th century near the Verde River grew corn and other crops with the prospect of getting good prices from nearby Prescott, which was the territorial capital, and from nearby miners. The rapid increase in population for the mining economy disrupted the hunting and gathering environments of the local Native American tribes, the Dilzhe&#x27;e Apache and Yavapai. In turn, they raided the farmers&#x27; crops for food.

The farmers requested military protection from the United States Army and, in 1865, although Arizona was still only a territory, the infantry arrived. They set up several posts over the next few years:
* 1865, a small camp five miles (8 km) south of what is today Camp Verde.
* 1866–1871, Camp Lincoln, a mile north of today&#x27;s Fort Verde.
* 1871–1873, Camp Verde, built gradually from 1871 to 1873.
* 1879, Camp Verde, renamed Fort Verde
* 1891, Fort Verde abandoned
* 1899, sold at public auction

After approximately 1,500 local natives were placed on a reservation by 1872, the army&#x27;s role changed from protecting the settlers to ensuring that the Indians stayed on the reservation. The last major military engagement with uprising natives took place in 1882 at the Battle of Big Dry Wash.

The fort was never enclosed by walls or stockades, and it never saw fighting on site. At its height, it consisted of twenty-two buildings, only four of which survived until 1956, when local citizens created a small museum in the administration building. They later donated the buildings and ten acres (40,000 m2) as a State Park.

Some of the buildings were built with pice, which is large adobe slabs cast within wooden frames, rather than assembled from the more familiar individual adobe bricks.
==Historic structures in Fort Verde State Historic Park==
The following structures and markers are pictured:
* The &quot;0&quot; Mile General Crook Trail Marker which is located in the place where in 1871 General George Crook established a military supply trail which connected Forts Whipple, Verde and Apache. The marker is located close to the Fort Verde Administration Building.
* The main Administration Building. It contained the main offices from which the decisions as to the operations of the fort were made. It now houses the Visitor Center of the Fort Verde Museum and contains exhibits, period artifacts from military life, and history on the Indian Scouts and Indian Wars era.
* Inside the Commanding officers office in the Administration Building of Fort Verde.
* Display of uniforms once used by the men who served in Fort Verde. The display is in the old Administration Building.
* The Commanding Officer Quarters.
* The Bachelor Officers’ Quarters.
* The Doctor&#x27;s &amp; Surgeons Quarters.

<doc id="653333" wikidata="Q3586315" url="?curid=653333" title="2001 British Columbia general election">
<text>The 2001 British Columbia general election was the 37th provincial election in the Province of British Columbia, Canada. It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. The election was called on April 18, 2001 and held on May 16, 2001. Voter turnout was 55.4 per cent of all eligible voters.

The incumbent British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP), in office since 1991, had been rocked by two major scandals—the Fast Ferries Scandal and a bribery scandal involving Premier Glen Clark. With the NDP&#x27;s ratings flatlining, Clark resigned in August 1999, and Deputy Premier Dan Miller took over as caretaker premier until Ujjal Dosanjh was elected his permanent successor in February. Dosanjh was not, however, able to restore the party&#x27;s public image, and the BC NDP suffered a resounding defeat at the hands of the British Columbia Liberal Party (BC Liberals), led by former Vancouver mayor Gordon Campbell. The BC Liberals won over 57% of the popular vote, and an unprecedented 77 of the 79 seats in the provincial legislature—the largest victory in the province&#x27;s electoral history.

The BC NDP, on the other hand, suffered a near-total political collapse. The party lost almost half of the share of the popular vote that it had won in the 1996 election, while its seat count fell from 39 seats to only two—those of Deputy Premier and Education Minister Joy MacPhail and Community Development Minister Jenny Kwan. It was easily the worst defeat of a sitting government in British Columbia history. It was also the second-worst defeat of a sitting provincial government in Canada, eclipsed only by the New Brunswick election of 1987, the Alberta election of 1935, and the Prince Edward Island election of 1935. In those elections, the governing party–the New Brunswick Tories, the United Farmers of Alberta and the PEI Tories–was completely wiped off the map. Dosanjh resigned as party leader soon after the election; he had actually conceded defeat a week before voters went to the polls. Despite being the only other party in the Assembly, the BC NDP lacked the four seats then required for official party status.

The British Columbia Unity Party had been created as a union of conservative parties. Initially, Reform BC, the Social Credit, the British Columbia Party, and the Family Coalition Party had joined under the &quot;BC Unity&quot; umbrella. By the time the election was called, however, only the Family Coalition Party and a large majority of Reform BC segments had remained in the BC Unity coalition. The other parties had withdrawn to continue independently. The parties would collectively only earn around 4% of the vote, as voters, conscious of vote-splitting that had taken place between the Liberals, Reform BC, and the since-defunct Progressive Democratic Alliance in 1996, united behind the Liberals this time. Ron Gamble, sometime leader and sometime president of the renewed Reform BC continued his opposition to conservative mergers, consistently proclaiming a &quot;Say No to Chris Delaney &amp; BC Unity&quot; policy, until Unity&#x27;s eventual collapse in 2004 after a failed second attempt at a merger with BC Conservatives.

== 2000 redistribution of ridings ==
An Act was passed in 2000 providing for an increase of seats from 75 to 79, upon the next election. The following changes were made:

<text>Greymouth () (Māori: &quot;Māwhera&quot;) is the largest town in the West Coast region in the South Island of New Zealand, and the seat of the Grey District Council. The population of the whole Grey District is , which accounts for % of the West Coast&#x27;s inhabitants. The Greymouth urban area had an estimated population of A large proportion of the District, 65%, is part of the Conservation Estate owned and managed by the Department of Conservation making Greymouth a natural centre for walkers and trampers.

==Location==

The town is located at the mouth of the Grey River, on a narrow coastal plain close to the foot of the Southern Alps. In clear weather, Aoraki / Mount Cook can be clearly seen to the south from near the town. The mouth of the river divides the town into three areas: Blaketown, close to the river&#x27;s mouth on the south bank; Karoro, to the southeast, separated from Blaketown by a series of small estuarine lagoons; and Cobden, formerly a separate town, on the river&#x27;s north bank.

Greymouth is on , which connects it with Hokitika in the south and Westport in the north. It also stands at the terminus of , which runs through Dobson and Reefton, eventually reaching North Canterbury and its junction with State Highway 1 at Waipara, north of Christchurch, via Lewis Pass. Highway 73 is accessed south of Greymouth, which is the most direct route to or from Christchurch.
The town is also the western terminus of the Midland line from Christchurch. Large coal trains often operate from Greymouth on this line to Christchurch. The famous TranzAlpine train also terminates at Greymouth. The Greymouth Airport is only south of the centre of the town.

==Climate==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as oceanic (Cfb). The mean annual rainfall Greymouth receives is high by New Zealand standards and is distributed relatively evenly throughout the year. This is due to its position receiving marine westerlies throughout the year that often do not rise above the Southern Alps. As a result, it creates a rain shadow effect that sees east coast locations having far sunnier and warmer summers. This extreme marine influence also shelters the Greymouth area from hot summer days and cold winter nights. Snow is uncommon, with the last reported event occurring on 4 August 2019.

On 10 March 2005, a major tornado, which started as a waterspout, made landfall in the suburb of Blaketown. It quickly moved through the town passing just south of the main town centre. The tornado was one of the largest reported in recent history in the West Coast region, caused millions of dollars in damage, and injured several people. Previous tornadoes which had struck Greymouth on 16 June 2003 and 28 March 2001 had destroyed several buildings.

===The Barber===

A katabatic wind blows down the Grey Valley and is known locally as the Barber, which can be seen as well as felt because a mist accompanies the cold wind. In the early twentieth century the Barber was also known as the &quot;gorge wind&quot;. It was reported that there were changes to the direction, severity and coldness of the wind in that era and this change was attributed to the felling of trees on the Coast Road leading north towards the new settlements of Dunollie and Seven Mile. Greymouth businesses would often advertise the benefits of their products, especially clothing to ward off the chill of the Barber.

===Flooding===
A combination of high intensity rainfall, high topographic relief and short steep rivers often leads to rapid flooding of low-lying land across the West Coast. Since its founding Greymouth has experienced two dozen floods by the Grey River, with many of the most significant being assigned names: for example, the Great Flood (1872), the Jubilee Flood (1887), the Big Flood (1905), The Biggest Since 1887 (1936), The Biggest Since 1936 (1977), The Big One (May 1988) and The Biggest (September 1988). After the two floods in 1988 the mayor of Greymouth, Barry Dallas, organised the construction of a flood protection wall. Rising 2 m above the level of the railway embankment and riverside wharf, it was completed in September 1990 at a cost of NZ$4m. Since its completion Greymouth has not suffered a significant flood, although the river has come close to the top of the flood wall several times.

==Local walks==
With 65% of the Grey District forming part of the Conservation Estate, there are many local walks to enjoy.

===Coal Creek Track===

The path gently descends down to the Coal Creek valley though a mixed beech-podocarp forest. The walk is approximately 3.6 km return and is accessed 8 km northeast of Greymouth at Runanga.

===King Domain Walk===
This is a zigzag uphill track taking in four lookouts across Greymouth and the Grey Valley. The first lookout shows the Greymouth town centre and the Grey River. The second lookout provides a view of central Greymouth from a greater elevation. The third lookout at a rock outcrop gives a view of Cobden and the final lookout provides a panorama of the lower Grey Valley.

===Kōwhai Bush Walk===
Located off Turumaha Street next to Anzac Park, this short loop walk takes you through the Kōwhai Forrest, half of which is bounded by the mudflats of Blaketown Lagoon. There are some boardwalks which follow through estuarine vegetation.

===Omotomotu Bush Walk===
This walk is located in the only substantial forest area close to Greymouth. It is located on Marsden Road and is a 25 minute loop track. Halfway along the track is a deviation to a lookout point with views of regenerating forest.

===Point Elizabeth Walkway===

This walk is accessed via North Beach Road, Cobden or Seven Mile Road, Rapahoe and is 5.5 km one way. It is a well-formed walk through coastal bush with stunning cliff top views.

===Woods Creek Walk===
This forest track passes by tailraces and dams and through tunnels built by gold miners in the 19th century and is a 1.1 km loop track. It is approximately 30 km southeast of Greymouth.

==History==
===Polynesian settlement===
Archaeological evidence shows Māori settlements on the West Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island dating back to 1300–1400 AD. Located at Karamea, Westport (Kawatiri), Bruce Bay (Mahitahi) and Jackson Bay (Okahu), excavations have identified in-ground cooking ovens (hāngī) and middens (rubbish tips). They show that these early Māori ate moa and seals as well as fish from the river and sea. These earliest West Coast people were from east Polynesia. Their stone knives and adzes were made by using the Polynesian flaking method and personal ornaments found on the sites were based on traditional Polynesian shark-tooth designs. These early people were subsumed by later Māori tribes (iwi) who came to the West Coast as population grew and settlement spread.

===Ngāi Tahu on Te Tai Poutini===
Ngāi Tahu came to Te Tai Poutini (the West Coast) about the start of the nineteenth century. Under Tūhuru Kōkare, a great warrior, they defeated the Ngāti Wairangi in a series of battles for the greenstone (pounamu) coast. The West Coast was one of the principal sources of the highly-prized greenstone which is almost as hard as steel. The Poutini Ngāi Tahu built fortified pā at Māwhera (Greymouth), Ōkārito and Mahitahi (Bruce Bay) and had villages or gardens at other places including Inangahua, Taramakau, Mahinapua, Pouerua, Okuru and Arawhata (Jackson Bay). The name Māwhera (meaning &#x27;wide spread river mouth&#x27;, is still an alternative name for the Grey River.

===European settlement===
The first Europeans to visit the site of what is now Greymouth were Thomas Brunner and Charles Heaphy in 1846. Brunner and Heaphy were detailed by the Nelson Land Company to investigate the country south of the Buller and to report on its resources and potential as a field for further settlement. They set out from Nelson on 17 March 1846 accompanied by a Māori named Kehu, who had previously visited the West Coast and who had agreed to act as their guide. Brunner discovered coal in the Grey Valley, and several places in the region (notably the town of Brunner and Lake Brunner) bear his name. Brunner himself named the Grey River after Sir George Grey, Governor of New Zealand.

As numbers of colonists continued to increase in Nelson and Canterbury, interest grew in settling the West Coast, but the land was still owned by Māori – Poutini Ngāi Tahu. In 1857 Poutini Ngāi Tahu chiefs wrote to Donald McLean, the New Zealand government land purchase officer, offering to sell the land for £2500, as long as some land was reserved for their use and they kept their rights to the pounamu (greenstone) of the Arahura River. In 1859, James Mackay was sent to broker a purchase deal, known as the Arahura Deed. This was signed in Māwhera by leading chiefs on 21 May 1860: it sold the entire West Coast to the Crown for just £300 (), apart from a scattering of reserves totalling . (Just after the signing, Mackay capsized his canoe in the Grey River, and some of the writing in the document is smudged to this day.) The reserves included Māwhera, now the centre of Greymouth.

On 22 July 1864 the &quot;Nelson&quot; became the first steamer to cross the Grey bar and steam up the Grey River. Aboard the &#x27;Nelson&#x27; were Matthew Batty and Reuben Waite plus approximately 70 prospectors. Reuben Waite would open the first store in Greymouth on the banks of the Grey River at the corner of which is now Waite Street and Mawhera Quay. Matthew Batty would become the first European coal miner on the Grey River overseeing a group of Māori digging up the Brunner Seam on the Grey River bank.

John Rochfort undertook the original survey of the site of the township in 1865. Greymouth was proclaimed a borough on 16 July 1868, and on 26 August 1868 an election was held. On 16 September 1868, the new borough council held its first meeting and unanimously elected Edward Masters as the first mayor of Greymouth.

From 1853 until the abolition of provinces in 1876, Greymouth was first part of Canterbury Province (the West Coast part of the Province was known as West Canterbury) and then part of an independent Westland Province. However Cobden, on the north (or right) bank of the Grey River was a part of Nelson Province from 1853 to 1876. The boundary between the Canterbury and Nelson provinces had been set as a straight line from the head of the Hurunui River to Lake Brunner at a time when the area was virtually uninhabited, but the West Coast gold rush straddled that boundary, with a population boom also straddling the boundary. In 1866, there had been a proposal for portions of Canterbury Province, including the urban area of Greymouth and the rural area south, to be annexed and solely administered by Nelson Province. The situation for the citizens of the area was partially alleviated with the creation of the County of Westland – which had all the administrative powers of a provincial council, but saw the legislative powers remain with Parliament in Wellington. Members of Parliament were not happy with having to spend their time on local legislation, and in 1873 the government elevated the county to full provincial status as Westland Province.

===Shipwrecks on the Greymouth Bar===

The Greymouth Bar is a sandbar at the mouth of the Grey River. It is notorious in New Zealand and more than 44 ships have been wrecked there while entering, leaving or mooring in the harbour. The first shipwreck happened on 13 September 1863 when the schooner &quot;Gipsy&quot; carrying mostly gold diggers from Sydney, was caught in a northeasterly gale. Sixteen lives have been lost since 1865, when the &quot;Nugget&quot; drifted out of the river and across the bar at night. The cutter was half full of water when the crew came on deck and only one of the two crewmen made it safely to shore.

The year 1866 was the most dangerous year for shipping in Greymouth, with five schooners and screw steamers being wrecked due to a number of reasons, including getting stranded on the spit, sheered in current, insufficient tug power and the engine stopped.

On 23 June 1910 the &quot;Lauderdale&quot; was heading to Greymouth from Nydia Bay and on 27 June struck the north tiphead, ending up stranded on the Blaketown beach after, at one point, being grounded against another shipwreck from 1908, the &quot;Hawea&quot;. The &quot;Lauderdale&quot; is one of three wrecks which remain on the Greymouth coastline in the twenty-first century and in April 2016 a local Blaketown family unveiled a commemorative plaque on the West Coast Cycle Trail, telling its story. This plaque is within sight of the wreck remains which appear and disappear on the shoreline with the tides. The &quot;Abel Tasman&quot; and the &quot;Hawea&quot; are the other two remaining wrecks.

==Economy==
Greymouth was founded during the West Coast gold rush of the 1860s, but for 150 years after this its economy was based on coal mining and native timber forestry. These brought prosperity to the town which at one point had 47 hotels (today it has only six). In 2020 most of the coal mines have now closed yet at there were once ten coal mines in the Brunner Field. Brunner (1861–1935), Tyneside (1876–1954), Wallsend (1894–1932), Coal Pit Heath (1877–1893), Coolgardie (1894–1932), Pig and Whistle (1900–1944), South Brunner (1906–1907), St Kilda (1907–1921), North Brunner (1908–1920), Dobson (1920–1968). The 10 mines produced over 8 million tonnes of coal. The coal reserves in the district including - measured, indicated, and inferred total 164 million tonnes. Fishing has long been important to the town, despite the fact that the entrance to the Grey River has two notoriously dangerous sandbars; an inner and outer bar.

Beginning in the 1960s, forestry and coal mining began to decline on the West Coast. The planned opening of the Pike River Mine in early 2008 spurred new investments in upgrading port facilities at the town. The opening of the new mine, as well as the planned Spring Creek mine, was called the biggest investment happening in the area for a hundred years; coal barges travelling to and from reshipment facilities in Taranaki would have carried containerised cargo to the town and saved the port from closure. On 19 November 2010, there was an explosion at the Pike River Mine, trapping 29 miners. Attempts to rescue the trapped miners were repeatedly delayed due to high levels of methane gas, until a second explosion on 24 November dashed all hope of survival for the miners. Pike River Coal went into receivership in the wake of the disaster and was purchased by Solid Energy, which closed the Spring Creek Mine in 2012 with the loss of 220 jobs and went into voluntary administration in August 2015.

After the decline in coal mining and forestry, the West Coast economy has become increasingly dependent on ecotourism. Thousands of coal mining jobs had declined to just 60, and hundreds of tourism jobs had replaced them. During Greymouth&#x27;s boom years, much of the centre of town was built up in brick Art Deco building on leased land in the Mawhera Reserve. This land was administered for many years by the Department of Maori Affairs, but was returned to the control of the iwi in 1976. At that time Mawhera Inc&#x27;s total assets were worth $2m, but had grown to $123m by 2018. Mawhera Inc is now the town&#x27;s largest landlord, with 1600 shareholders. After regulations were tightened following the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, many of Greymouth&#x27;s heritage buildings were found to be unsafe, and the combination of earthquake-strengthening costs and being on lease land makes many of them uneconomic to restore and occupy.

Greymouth is also known for its pounamu (&quot;greenstone&quot;, a form of jade) carving industry which goes back to Māori origins. The town&#x27;s local brewery, Monteith&#x27;s, has produced beer since 1868 which is now sold nationwide.

==Education==
Greymouth has several state primary schools offering education up to year 8, and Greymouth High School and John Paul II High School providing secondary education. There are also state-integrated Catholic primary and secondary schools.

Tai Poutini Polytechnic has its head office based in Greymouth. It also has campuses in Auckland, Christchurch, Hokitika, Reefton, Wānaka and Westport.

==Arts and culture==

===Left Bank Art Gallery===

Founded in 1992, the Left Bank Art Gallery in Greymouth is located in the former Bank of New Zealand building on the left bank of the Grey River. It is operated by the West Coast Society of the Arts and exhibits the works of artists from Karamea to Haast and holds the National Pounamu Collection.

===Art in the Park===
In 2007 the first Art in the Park event was organised in Greymouth at Dixon Park by Linda and Ashley Morley, South Africans living in New Zealand. They brought the concept from South Africa. In 2008 inclement weather meant the organisers sought an alternative venue that was more sheltered from rain. The 2009 Art in the Park was held at Shantytown, and remained there for a couple of years before locating to the Greymouth High School gymnasium.

===Greymouth Operatic Society===
In 1944 the Greymouth Operatic Society was formalised, following a number of successful patriotic reviews and concerts during the war years. The first production in 1945 was &quot;The Country Girl&quot; with Beverley Patterson in the lead role of &#x27;Marjorie Joy&#x27;. In 2021 the Greymouth Operatic Society is a thriving operation, providing the opportunity for local performers, musician and stage crews to learn all things theatre. The aim of the Society is to support, educate, and nurture local talent.

==Suburbs==
*Inner suburbs:
** Cobden – reflects the English origins and political awareness of its founders. Many of the streets are named for English political rebels and reformers of their times. Richard Cobden (1804–1865) was a radical politician involved in repealing the Corn Laws, emancipating the worker and encouraging free trade. Some of his contemporaries such as John Bright and Edward Cardwell also have streets named after them. Other more recent streets honour some of Cobden&#x27;s significant citizens.
**Greymouth Central – Māwhera to Māori but renamed &#x27;Grey&#x27; to honour the then Governor of New Zealand Sir George Grey. The earliest street names honour pioneer residents, explorers and prominent local Māori, while others pay tribute to English literary figures and politicians. Later developments recognise the achievements of local residents who contributed significantly to civic and local body affairs.
**Blaketown – named for its founder, Isaac Blake who, according to his contemporaries, although unable to read was a wily and ambitious character. He came as a gold prospector but soon saw that there was more money to be made as a trader and storekeeper. In its early days, Blaketown was bigger than Greymouth. Blaketown shows the influence of early politicians in its street names.
**Wharemoa
**Karoro - the meaning in Māori is &#x27;blacked-backed gull&#x27; or &#x27;seagull&#x27;. The streets of Karoro, which are mostly the result of more recent subdivision, reflect the names of developers or landowners in the area. Some are named for geographic features and native trees.
*Outer suburbs:
**South Beach
**Paroa – the meaning in Māori is &#x27;long fortified village&#x27;. The area around the Saltwater Creek was so named in 1866 when upwards of two thousand men were prospecting in the area. The streets of Paroa are mostly named for prominent citizens and landowners.
**Rutherglen
**Gladstone
**Camerons

<text>Cí (pronounced ; ), also known as chángduǎnjù () and shīyú (), is a type of lyric poetry in the tradition of Classical Chinese poetry that also draws upon folk traditions. &quot;Cí,&quot; also known as &quot;song lyrics,&quot; use various poetic meters derived from a base set of fixed pattern forms, using fixed-rhythm, fixed-tone, and line-lengths varying according that of the model examples. The rhythmic and tonal pattern of the &quot;cí&quot; are based upon certain, definitive musical song tunes (&quot;cípái&quot;), and in many cases the name of the musical tune is given in the title of a &quot;cí&quot; piece, in a form such as &quot;after (the tune of)...&quot;

Typically, the number of characters in each line and the arrangement of tones were determined by one of around 800 set patterns, each associated with a particular title, called &quot;cípái&quot; (). Originally, they were written to be sung to a tune of that title, with a set rhythm, rhyme, and tempo. Therefore, the title may have nothing to do with its content. Indeed, several &quot;cí&quot; often shared the same title. The titles did not refer to the content, but rather their shared rhythmic and tonal patterns. Some &quot;cí&quot; have a &quot;subtitle&quot; or a commentary, sometimes as long as a paragraph, indicating the content. Sometimes, for the sake of clarity, a &quot;cí&quot; is listed under its title, followed by its first line.

==History==
Although the oldest surviving textual examples of &quot;cí&quot; are from 8th century CE Dunhuang manuscripts, beginning in the poetry of the Liang dynasty, the &quot;ci&quot; followed the tradition of the &quot;Shi Jing&quot; and the &quot;yuefu&quot;: they were lyrics which developed from anonymous popular songs into a sophisticated literary genre. In the case of the &quot;cí&quot; form, some of its fixed-rhythm patterns have been influenced by music and poetry of Central Asia and elsewhere.

The &quot;ci&quot; form developed during the late Tang dynasty. Although the contributions of Li Bai (701–762) are fraught with historical doubt, certainly the Tang poet Wen Tingyun (812–870) was a great master of the &quot;ci&quot;, writing it in its distinct and mature form. One of the more notable practitioners and developers of this form was Li Yu of the Southern Tang dynasty, during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, subsequent to Tang. Before the &quot;ci&quot; form was formalized by the scholarly, it&#x27;s antecedents had grown up in a setting of popular music. Serindian influences were particularly important in this regard; with the influence of Kucha drum dance tunes being the most important. Much of the process of importing Serindian influence into Classical Chinese poetry was mediated through the short-lived state of Western Liang (555–587). Western Liang was basically a city-state centered on the city known in Tang times as Liangzhou. In Western Liang a musical hybrid of Chinese and Kuchean traditions developed, and became popularized throughout the Tang culture, from the people to even the emperor Xuanzong (reigned 713–756). This was part of a larger movement: &quot;...of all the specialists of ambiguous social status who were sent to China by a foreign government, the most popular and influential were the musicians―instrumentalists, singers, and dancers―and the instruments and musical modes that they brought with them...For many centuries, the music of the West had had its admirers in China, but under the Sui [581–618] emperors there was a great vogue for it, which continued into T&#x27;ang times.&quot; Foreign music (in terms of performers, instruments, musical modes, and songs) was brought to China, often as a result of wars of conquest or as a type of &quot;tribute&quot; and this music found a place in informal settings at the imperial court to other less reputable settings. &quot;Ci&quot; poetry largely developed during the late Tang from the music made in popular settings such as houses of pleasure and from the inclusion of romantic and erotic themes of late Tang poets such as Li Shangyin.

However, the &quot;ci&quot; form of Classical Chinese poetry is especially associated with the poetry of the Song dynasty, during which it was indeed a popular poetic form. A revival of the &quot;cí&quot; poetry form occurred during the end of the Ming dynasty and the beginning of the Qing dynasty which was characterized by an exploration of the emotions connected with romantic love together with its secularization, often in a context of a brief poetic story narrative within a &quot;cí&quot; poem or a linked group of &quot;cí&quot; poems in an application of the &quot;chuanqi&quot; form of short story tales to poetry.

==Classification==
=== Song ===
During the Song dynasty (960–1279), two main categories of &quot;cí&quot; employed were &quot;xiǎolìng&quot; (小令; the original form since pre-Song) and &quot;màncí&quot; (慢詞; starting with Liu Yong), depending on the song being either short and in fast tempo or long and in slow tempo. Most &quot;xiǎolìng&quot; were written in the pre-Song era.

=== Ming and Qing ===
Later, during the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1912) dynasties, the &quot;cí&quot;, or rather the &quot;cípái&quot;, became classified for the number of characters it dictates. It is called

# &quot;xiǎolìng&quot; 小令 if it is no more than 58 characters,
# &quot;zhōngdiào&quot; 中調 for 59–90 characters, and
# &quot;chángdiào&quot; 長調 for over 90 characters.

If the &quot;ci&quot; appears in one stanza, it is called &quot;dāndiào&quot; (單調). The largest majority is &quot;shuāngdiào&quot; (雙調) with two stanzas or &quot;què&quot; (闋) in identical or nearly identical patterns. There also are rare cases of &quot;sāndié&quot; (三疊) and &quot;sìdié&quot; (四疊), for three and four &quot;qüè&quot;, respectively. In terms of style, &quot;cí&quot; can also be classified as either &quot;wǎnyuē&quot; (婉約; grace) or &quot;háofàng&quot; (豪放; bold).

== Formation ==
There are four main tones in Mandarin Chinese, though a fifth (&quot;neutral&quot;) tone may be considered. The tonal systems of past centuries were different. The term &quot;tonal contour&quot; is used to indicate that these tones are not tones in the sense of absolute musical pitches, but rather in terms of the overall relative &quot;shape&quot; of the tones as spoken or chanted.

The four tones of Middle Chinese were first described by Shen Yue around AD 500. They were the &quot;level&quot; (平 píng), &quot;rising&quot; (上 shǎng), &quot;departing&quot; (去 qù), and &quot;entering&quot; (入 rù) tones.&quot; The level is classified in 平 ping; and the rising, departing and entering are classified in 仄 ze. So, in any cipai, the formation of Ci, each Chinese character in Ci will be required in detailed tones with 平 or 仄.

==Cipai==
Cipai (), also called Cige and Cidiao, is the name of various formations of Ci. Most &quot;cípái&quot; consist of three characters. The literal meaning of a &quot;cípái&quot; can be rather obscure, making it difficult to translate. Some are taken straight from earlier poems, and some are clearly of Non-Han origin—mostly songs introduced from Central Asia. Some &quot;cípái&quot; have alternative names, usually taken from a famous piece of that very &quot;cípái&quot;. There also are variants of certain &quot;cípái&quot;, indicated by a prefix or a suffix. The formations of Ci are complicated, in different names of cipai, the number of characters, syntactical structure, tones and rhyme are also different.

==Example==
For example, choosing the &quot;cipai&quot; Jiang Chengzi or &quot;Riverside City&quot; (江城子), the tone requirements of each character in this cipai is following:

仄平平仄仄平平。仄平平，仄平平。仄仄平平，仄仄仄平平。仄仄平平平仄仄，平仄仄，仄平平。

平平仄仄仄平平。仄平平，仄平平。仄仄平平，仄仄仄平平。仄仄平平平仄仄，平仄仄，仄平平。

The following is a &quot;cí&quot; poem based on 江城子.

:十年生死兩茫茫，
:不思量，自難忘。
:千里孤墳，無處話淒涼。
:縱使相逢應不識，
:塵滿面，鬢如霜。

:夜來幽夢忽還鄉，
:小軒窗，正梳妝。
:相顧無言，唯有淚千行。
:料得年年斷腸處，
:明月夜，短松岡。

General translation:
:Ten boundless years now separate the living and the dead.
:I have not often thought of her, but neither can I forget.
:Her lonely grave is a thousand &quot;li&quot; distant, I can&#x27;t say where my wife lies cold.
:We could not recognise each other even if we met again,
:My face is all but covered with dust, my temples glazed with frost.

:In deepest night, a sudden dream returns me to my homeland.
:She sits before a little window, and sorts her dress and make-up.
:We look at each other without a word, a thousand lines of tears.
:Must it be that every year I&#x27;ll think of that heart-breaking place,
:Where the moon shines brightly in the night, and bare pines guard the tomb.
:——Su Shi, 蘇軾,《江城子·十年生死兩茫茫》

In the title of this &quot;cí&quot;, &quot;Riverside City&quot; is the name of &quot;cípái.&quot; Su Shi was married when he was 19, and his wife was 16. His wife died when she was only 27. Because of his government duties, Su Shi moved to many different places in China, all far away from his hometown. One night in early 1075, about 10 years after her death, Su Shi dreamed of his wife, then composed this famous &quot;cí&quot;.

<text>The human musculoskeletal system (also known as the human locomotor system, and previously the activity system) is an organ system that gives humans the ability to move using their muscular and skeletal systems. The musculoskeletal system provides form, support, stability, and movement to the body.

The human musculoskeletal system is made up of the bones of the skeleton, muscles, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, joints, and other connective tissue that supports and binds tissues and organs together. The musculoskeletal system&#x27;s primary functions include supporting the body, allowing motion, and protecting vital organs. The skeletal portion of the system serves as the main storage system for calcium and phosphorus and contains critical components of the hematopoietic system.

This system describes how bones are connected to other bones and muscle fibers via connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments. The bones provide stability to the body. Muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones. To allow motion, different bones are connected by joints. Cartilage prevents the bone ends from rubbing directly onto each other. Muscles contract to move the bone attached at the joint.

There are, however, diseases and disorders that may adversely affect the function and overall effectiveness of the system. These diseases can be difficult to diagnose due to the close relation of the musculoskeletal system to other internal systems. The musculoskeletal system refers to the system having its muscles attached to an internal skeletal system and is necessary for humans to move to a more favorable position. Complex issues and injuries involving the musculoskeletal system are usually handled by a physiatrist (specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation) or an orthopaedic surgeon.

== Subsystems ==

=== Skeletal ===

The skeletal system serves many important functions; it provides the shape and form for the body, support and protection, allows bodily movement, produces blood for the body, and stores minerals. The number of bones in the human skeletal system is a controversial topic. Humans are born with over 300 bones; however, many bones fuse together between birth and maturity. As a result, an average adult skeleton consists of 206 bones. The number of bones varies according to the method used to derive the count. While some consider certain structures to be a single bone with multiple parts, others may see it as a single part with multiple bones. There are five general classifications of bones. These are long bones, short bones, flat bones, irregular bones, and sesamoid bones. The human skeleton is composed of both fused and individual bones supported by ligaments, tendons, muscles and cartilage. It is a complex structure with two distinct divisions; the axial skeleton, which includes the vertebral column, and the appendicular skeleton.

====Function====
The skeletal system serves as a framework for tissues and organs to attach themselves to. This system acts as a protective structure for vital organs. Major examples of this are the brain being protected by the skull and the lungs being protected by the rib cage.

Located in long bones are two distinctions of bone marrow (yellow and red). The yellow marrow has fatty connective tissue and is found in the marrow cavity. During starvation, the body uses the fat in yellow marrow for energy. The red marrow of some bones is an important site for blood cell production, approximately 2.6 million red blood cells per second in order to replace existing cells that have been destroyed by the liver. Here all erythrocytes, platelets, and most leukocytes form in adults. From the red marrow, erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes migrate to the blood to do their special tasks.

Another function of bones is the storage of certain minerals. Calcium and phosphorus are among the main minerals being stored. The importance of this storage &quot;device&quot; helps to regulate mineral balance in the bloodstream. When the fluctuation of minerals is high, these minerals are stored in the bone; when it is low they will be withdrawn from the bone.

=== Muscular ===
 
There are three types of muscles—cardiac, skeletal, and smooth. Smooth muscles are used to control the flow of substances within the lumens of hollow organs, and are not consciously controlled. Skeletal and cardiac muscles have striations that are visible under a microscope due to the components within their cells. Only skeletal and smooth muscles are part of the musculoskeletal system and only the muscles can move the body. Cardiac muscles are found in the heart and are used only to circulate blood; like the smooth muscles, these muscles are not under conscious control. Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and arranged in opposing groups around joints. Muscles are innervated, whereby nervous signals are communicated by nerves, which conduct electrical currents from the central nervous system and cause the muscles to contract.

====Contraction initiation ====
In mammals, when a muscle contracts, a series of reactions occur. Muscle contraction is stimulated by the motor neuron sending a message to the muscles from the somatic nervous system. Depolarization of the motor neuron results in neurotransmitters being released from the nerve terminal. The space between the nerve terminal and the muscle cell is called the neuromuscular junction. These neurotransmitters diffuse across the synapse and bind to specific receptor sites on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber. When enough receptors are stimulated, an action potential is generated and the permeability of the sarcolemma is altered. This process is known as initiation.

==== Tendons ====

A tendon is a tough, flexible band of fibrous connective tissue that connects muscles to bones. The extra-cellular connective tissue between muscle fibers binds to tendons at the distal and proximal ends, and the tendon binds to the periosteum of individual bones at the muscle&#x27;s origin and insertion. As muscles contract, tendons transmit the forces to the relatively rigid bones, pulling on them and causing movement. Tendons can stretch substantially, allowing them to function as springs during locomotion, thereby saving energy.

===Joints, ligaments and bursae===
The Joints are structures that connect individual bones and may allow bones to move against each other to cause movement. There are three divisions of joints, diarthroses which allow extensive mobility between two or more articular heads; amphiarthrosis, which is a joint that allows &quot;some&quot; movement, and false joints or synarthroses, joints that are immovable, that allow little or no movement and are predominantly fibrous. Synovial joints, joints that are not directly joined, are lubricated by a solution called synovial fluid that is produced by the synovial membranes. This fluid lowers the friction between the articular surfaces and is kept within an articular capsule, binding the joint with its taut tissue.

==== Ligaments ====

A ligament is a small band of dense, white, fibrous elastic tissue. Ligaments connect the ends of bones together in order to form a joint. Most ligaments limit dislocation, or prevent certain movements that may cause breaks. Since they are only elastic they increasingly lengthen when under pressure. When this occurs the ligament may be susceptible to break resulting in an unstable joint.

Ligaments may also restrict some actions: movements such as hyper extension and hyper flexion are restricted by ligaments to an extent. Also ligaments prevent certain directional movement.

==== Bursae ====

A bursa is a small fluid-filled sac made of white fibrous tissue and lined with synovial membrane. Bursa may also be formed by a synovial membrane that extends outside of the joint capsule. It provides a cushion between bones and tendons or muscles around a joint; bursa are filled with synovial fluid and are found around almost every major joint of the body.

==Clinical significance==
Because many other body systems, including the vascular, nervous, and integumentary systems, are interrelated, disorders of one of these systems may also affect the musculoskeletal system and complicate the diagnosis of the disorder&#x27;s origin. Diseases of the musculoskeletal system mostly encompass functional disorders or motion discrepancies; the level of impairment depends specifically on the problem and its severity. In a study of hospitalizations in the United States, the most common inpatient OR procedures in 2012 involved the musculoskeletal system: knee arthroplasty, laminectomy, hip replacement, and spinal fusion.

Articular (of or pertaining to the joints) disorders are the most common. However, also among the diagnoses are: primary muscular diseases, neurologic (related to the medical science that deals with the nervous system and disorders affecting it) deficits, toxins, endocrine abnormalities, metabolic disorders, infectious diseases, blood and vascular disorders, and nutritional imbalances.

Disorders of muscles from another body system can bring about irregularities such as: impairment of ocular motion and control, respiratory dysfunction, and bladder malfunction. Complete paralysis, paresis, or ataxia may be caused by primary muscular dysfunctions of infectious or toxic origin; however, the primary disorder is usually related to the nervous system, with the muscular system acting as the effector organ, an organ capable of responding to a stimulus, especially a nerve impulse.

One understated disorder that begins during pregnancy is pelvic girdle pain. It is complex, multi-factorial, and likely to be also represented by a series of sub-groups driven by pain varying from peripheral or central nervous system, altered laxity/stiffness of muscles, laxity to injury of tendinous/ligamentous structures
to maladaptive body mechanics.

<doc id="653350" wikidata="Q1294423" url="?curid=653350" title="Shelah (son of Judah)">
<text>According to the Bible, Shelah/Shela () was the third son of Judah, and was born at Chezib, which can be identified with an unknown town in the vicinity of Mareshah. 

==Biblical narrative==
According to the book of Genesis, God had killed Shelah&#x27;s two older brothers, Er and Onan. Judah was unwilling to allow Tamar, who had been successively Er&#x27;s and Onan&#x27;s wife, to be married to Shelah. Judah&#x27;s concern was that Tamar might be cursed and Shelah might die if married to her. So Judah told her to wait until Shelah had grown up. When Shelah came of age, Judah neglected to marry him to Tamar. In the Book of Chronicles, &quot;Shelah&quot; is identified as the name of a clan, containing a subclan named &quot;Er.&quot;

According , the sons of Shelah were:&lt;br&gt;
#Er, the father of Lecah
#Laadah, the father of Mareshah.
#The families of the house of the linen workers of the house of Ashbea
#Jokim, the men of Chozeba
#Joash
#Saraph
#Jashubi-Lehem
The descendants of the last 4 sons were potters who dwelt at Netaim and Gederah and worked for the king.

According to some biblical scholars, the description of &quot;Shelah&quot; is an eponymous aetiological myth concerning fluctuations in the constituency of the tribe of Judah, with &quot;Shelah&quot; representing the newest clan to become part of the tribe. The Book of Chronicles&#x27; description of &quot;Er&quot; as a descendant of Shelah, suggests that &quot;Er&quot; was in reality the name of a clan that was originally equal in status to the &quot;Shelah&quot; clan, but was later subsumed by it.

Professor Aaron Demsky argues that the genealogy of Shelah is an allegory of the history of Shelanite clans in Shephelah (i.e. Judean foothills). Remnants of the Er clan joined the Shelanites and founded the city of Lecah, which was the alternative name for Lachish. Later, the Laadah clan founded Mareshah, a town of secondary importance to Lachish. The families of Beth Asheba lived in a town of the same name and produced clothing for the priesthood and aristocracy, using byssus cloth. The Jokim clan founded Chozeba, which was synonymous with the Chezib near Mareshah. The Joash and Saraph clans lived with the Moabites. The last Shelanite clans to emerge consisted of the residents of Lahem or Lahmas. The last four clans worked for the king, who was most likely Hezekiah.

In 701 BC, Sennacherib destroyed important Shelanite cities. Survivors fled to Jerusalem and assimilated with the local populace after the return of Babylonian exiles in c.a. 538 BC. According to Demsky, the author of the Book of Chronicles considered the Shelanite clans to be inferior to other Judahite clans, based on their positioning in the biblical text. 

Scholars have argued that the Tamar and Shelah narrative has a secondary role in either promoting the institution of levirate marriage, or presenting an aetiological myth for its origin; Shelah&#x27;s role in the narrative would thus be as the example of a brother refusing to perform levirate marriage. John Emerton regards the evidence for this as inconclusive, though classical rabbinical writers argued that this narrative concerns the origin of levirate marriage.

<doc id="653373" wikidata="Q1429722" url="?curid=653373" title="Kahurangi National Park">
<text>Kahurangi National Park is a national park in the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand. It is the second largest of the thirteen national parks of New Zealand. It was gazetted in 1996 and covers , ranging from the Buller River near Murchison in the south, to the base of Farewell Spit in Golden Bay in the north. The park has no single dominant landform, but includes an unusually wide variety of landscapes, including mountain ranges, rivers, gorges, raised peneplains and karst features such as caves and arches. Many of the landforms within the park are considered to be nationally or internationally significant.

Its geology is complex, and is the most diverse of any of New Zealand&#x27;s protected areas. It includes the best sequence of palaezoic rocks in the country. The complexity of these rock formations suggest that they result from the collision of three former continents. Kahurangi National Park also contains 80% of all New Zealand&#x27;s alpine species. It also contains around 18 endemic bird species.

The park includes the Heaphy Track, a popular tramping and mountain biking track that is classified as one of New Zealand&#x27;s Great Walks. Another multi-day tramping track in the park is the Wangapeka Track. In addition to tramping, rafting and caving are popular activities. Several locations in the national park were used during the making of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series.

The park is managed by the Department of Conservation. Much of what was the North-west Nelson Forest Park formed the basis of the new park. Kahurangi Point, regarded as the boundary between the West Coast and Tasman Regions, is located in the park, as is Mount Owen.

== History ==
===Use by Māori===
There is archaeological evidence that Māori had settled the Kahurangi coastline from around 1380 CE, with pā sites on coastal ridges and evidence of more substantial habitation found around several of the river mouths and estuaries in the area.

The Anaweka waka found near the park&#x27;s western boundary was built as early as 1226 CE, and was sailed as late as 1400 CE. It is one of only two-long distance voyaging canoes known to have survived to modern times, and was probably used for return journeys from New Zealand back to the Pacific. The mouth of the Anaweka River, where the waka was discovered, supported many settlements.

The area had an abundance of food resources, with middens from a site near the mouth of the (Heaphy River) showing evidence of local Māori hunting bush moa, kekeno, and kurī. Excavation of the same site also demonstrated connections to trade routes running throughout New Zealand, with &quot;pounamu&quot; from the Arahura region and obsidian from Mayor Island / Tūhua in the Bay of Plenty both being used in the area. Māori interaction with the inland areas of the region was generally less common. Outside of frequently used trade routes connecting the top of the South Island to the West Coast, this was typically limited to seasonal hunting expeditions rather than the more permanent habitation along the coast.

For much of the region&#x27;s history, Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri were (held authority in) the region, having arrived in the early 1600s from the western North Island by way of the Marlborough Sounds and successfully displaced local Māori. This dominance of the region lasted for roughly 200 years, until other iwi began to encroach on the area in the early 1800s. Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri eventually succumbed to invasions by Ngāti Apa from the Kāpiti Coast to the northeast, Ngāti Kuia from the east, and Ngāi Tahu from the south, losing a decisive battle to the latter near Whanganui Inlet. Mana whenua status in the area was contested for much of the early 19th century, eventually settling with Te Atiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui, Ngāti Rārua and Ngāti Tama having authority in the Tasman region and Ngāi Tahu controlling from Kahurangi Point south.

=== Early Pākehā history ===
Early Europeans to visit the area were sealers. The seal colonies along the Kahurangi coast were almost exterminated within two decades. The establishment of the New Zealand Company’s settlement at Nelson in 1841 led to exploitation of timber, flax and coal resources in the region.

One of the early European settlers to discover the tablelands in the Mount Arthur area was Thomas Salisbury. He wrote to &quot;The Colonist&quot; in 1863, claiming to have discovered gold in stream beds in the tableland, and this led to a gold rush to the area. His brother John grazed sheep in the area in 1875.

The special character of flora and fauna in the region was recognised prior to 1920. One particular example is the Gouland Downs, an area with unusual geology and vegetation, situated at around elevation to the west of Mt Perry. The Gouland Downs was one of eleven sanctuaries designated by the Department of Internal Affairs in the year ending 31 March 1916. In 1918, the Department of Lands and Survey reported that of Crown land, including the Gouland Downs, had been reserved under the Scenery Preservation Act 1903. The protected area was reported to be rare and valuable, and included the habitat of kākāpō, kiwi, weka, and other native birds.

In 1970, approximately of land were gazetted as the North-west Nelson Forest Park as part of the amalgamation of eight forest parks in the region, under the management of the New Zealand Forest Service. At the time, many of the tracks in the park were overgrown. The Forest Service started on a programme of work to promote recreation in the park, including cutting new tracks and building huts.

=== Park establishment ===
An environmental lobby group, the Maruia Society, advocated for the establishment of a new national park in the area from the 1980s. In 1987, the management of the North West Nelson Forest Park was transferred to the newly formed Department of Conservation. The following year, an area of within the Forest Park was designated as the Tasman Wilderness Area under the National Parks Act 1980 section 14, as an important step towards the formation of a new national park.

Although the area does not have the iconic geographic features of previously established New Zealand national parks, at the time of its creation there was increasing interest in protecting biodiversity and geodiversity. Creation of a new national park was recommended by the Conservation Authority in 1993, but the Kahurangi National Park was not established until 1996. The new park was based largely on the area that had previously been the North West Nelson Forest Park, along with the Tasman Wilderness Area. At the time of approval, the new national park was the 13th national park to be established in New Zealand, and protected of land. In his announcement about the establishment of the park, the Minister of Conservation, Denis Marshall said: &quot;It consists of extensive areas of native forest and limestone and marble landscape which has international significance&quot;.

For the official opening, a ministerial party led by the prime minister, Jim Bolger, Denis Marshall, and Nick Smith (MP for the Tasman electorate) was flown by helicopter to Balloon Hut, south of the Cobb Reservoir. From there, they walked out via Flora Hut.

Five small parcels consisting of unmodified coastal areas and forest with high conservation values totalling were added to the park in 2016.

=== Proposed World Heritage Site ===
In 2007, Kahurangi National Park was added to the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, along with Farewell Spit and the Canaan karst system.

=== Addition of Mōkihinui River catchment ===
The Mōkihinui River is a river on the West Coast about 40 kilometres north of Westport. The river catchment area is a largely unmodified landscape of open tussock, podocarp-beech forests, and the pristine river itself. The area was highly rated for its biodiversity values, but prior to 2019, it was classified as stewardship land − the lowest level of protection for publicly-owned conservation land. In 2007, Meridian Energy had proposed to build the Mokihinui Hydro project on the river. The project was controversial and in May 2012 it was cancelled.

In 2019, of land in the Mōkihinui River catchment, including of river bed, were added to Kahurangi National Park. The addition increased the size of the park by 14%. The area added to the park includes part of the route of the Old Ghost Road, a mountain biking and hiking trail that follows a historic gold miners&#x27; route.

The significance of the Mokihinui region to the Ngāi Tahu iwi and Ngāti Waewae, the rūnanga for the area, was marked with the placement of a &quot;pouwhenua&quot; in July 2019.

== Geography ==
Kahurangi is New Zealand&#x27;s second-largest national park, with an area of . It covers most of the north-west corner of the South Island, and extends from the Buller River near Murchison in the south, to the base of Farewell Spit in Golden Bay in the north.

The park has no single dominant landform, but includes an unusually wide variety of landscapes, including mountain ranges, rivers, gorges, raised peneplains and karst features such as caves and arches. Many of the landforms within the park are considered to be nationally or internationally significant.

=== Landforms ===

==== Coastline ====

The western boundary of the park follows the route of the Heaphy Track along the coast from just south of the Kōhaihai River past Scotts Beach and north to the mouth of the Heaphy River. The route of the Heaphy Track then moves inland, but the park boundary carries on along the coastline to just past Kahurangi Point. This northern section of coastline is known for its steep cliffs.

The boundary of the park extends to mean high water springs, so does not include beaches below the high tide mark. The entire coastline from Kōhaihai to Kahurangi Point is considered nationally significant because it is almost totally unmodified, and includes a narrow strip of highly diverse coastal forest, including nīkau palms. The nīkau palms are New Zealand&#x27;s only native species in the palm family, and the section of coastline north of Kōhaihai is one of the easiest places to see large groves. The grove close to the Kohaihai end of the Heaphy Track is claimed to be the largest in the South Island.

The Kahurangi Marine Reserve is not part of the national park but is immediately adjacent to its western coastline. It extends along between Wekakura Point and Crayfish Point, and out to sea. It is one of the largest marine reserves around the North or South Islands. The northern end of the coast is a habitat for fur seals (Kekeno) and Hector&#x27;s dolphins, and driftwood along the coast is a habitat for animals like earwigs, sandhoppers and spiders. Rocky reefs and seastacks provide a habitat for encrusting animals, invertebrates and inshore fish that thrive in murky waters.

==== Gouland Downs ====

The Gouland Downs is a tussock-covered basin at around elevation, surrounded by forest. It occupies an area of around . The area has unusual flora and fauna and was first declared as a sanctuary in 1915.

This area is a peneplain, a low-relief plain formed from prolonged erosion. Beneath the tussock in the Gouland Downs are sandstone and mudstone sedimentary rocks that were formed in the Lower Palaeozoic era around 400 to 500 million years ago. They are some of the oldest rocks in New Zealand. These rocks were worn down by erosion to form the peneplain around 100 million years ago. They were then submerged beneath a shallow sea, and limestone was deposited on top of the older sedimentary rocks. The land was subsequently uplifted, and erosion removed most of the limestone, leaving isolated outcrops that now appear like tree-covered islands in the tussock landscape. The remaining areas of the Gouland Downs have shallow and infertile soil where the only plants that thrive are tussocks and rushes.

==== Cobb Valley ====
The Cobb region is a montane catchment on argillite, ancient volcanics, and ultramafics. It supports beech and conifer-beech forests, valley floor scrub and tussock-grasslands, and sub-alpine grasslands. The region includes several alpine lakes and the Cobb Reservoir – a hydro-electric storage lake that is entirely surrounded by the national park.

==== Mount Arthur tablelands ====

The tablelands to the west of Mount Arthur are a rolling landscape of tussock and karst features at an elevation of around . The area is surrounded by the peaks of Mount Lodestone (1,462 m), Mount Arthur (1,795 m) and Mount Peel (1,654 m).

==== Ōpārara Basin ====
The Ōpārara Basin is a basin at around elevation that is covered in dense forest and drained by the Ōpārara River. It is located north of Karamea. The basin is notable for a network of caves rich in fossils, and its large natural rock arches. Ōpārara Arch is New Zealand’s largest natural arch, at in length and in height. The area is considered as one of the most outstanding examples of limestone karst landscapes in New Zealand. There are multiple short walks in the area that are popular with visitors.

The Honeycomb Hill Cave area in the basin was discovered in 1976, and in 1982 was given the status of a site of global significance in paleozoology due to discoveries of bones of several species that had become extinct. In 1984, the first systematic discovery campaign led to finds of the bones of fifty birds, most of which were extinct species. In 2008, an area of was designated as the Honeycomb Hill Caves Specially Protected Area. Access to this area is restricted and by permit only.

==== Tasman Wilderness Area ====
The Tasman Wilderness Area is protected as a wilderness area under the National Parks Act 1980 section 14. The Tasman Wilderness covers within Kahurangi National Park. It is located in the central and western areas of the park, inland of the Ōpārara Basin and to the south of the route of the Heaphy Track. The centre of the wilderness area is Lake Aorere adjacent to Mount Domett (elevation . The wilderness area includes the catchments of the Roaring Lion, Spey, Burgoo, Beautiful, and Ugly rivers, among others. It takes around a week to traverse the wilderness area in any direction. Tracks, facilities and the use of vehicles are prohibited, in accordance with its status as a wilderness.

=== Climate ===
The weather in Kahurangi National Park is very changeable, especially at high altitudes. After heavy rainfall many rivers and streams become impassable. In winter, heavy snowfalls may occur at higher altitudes. For the Heaphy Track, in January and February, the average daily high temperature is between and with lows between and . July is the coldest month, with average daily high of and lows of .

The average annual rainfall at Karamea, at the western boundary of the park is around but at sites with western exposure and at higher elevations, the annual rainfall can reach . However, on the eastern side of the park, the climate is typically drier. In prevailing westerly conditions, moisture-laden air from the Tasman Sea is forced to rise over the high elevations of the western ranges. As the air rises, it cools and the stored water vapour condenses to form rain. This is known as orographic precipitation. As the airstream continues to the east beyond the mountains, it holds much less moisture, leading to reduced annual rainfall in the east. The effect can be seen in the west to east progression of average annual rainfall in towns to the north of the park boundary, with Collingwood having , Tākaka having , and Motueka .

=== Rivers ===
The park receives high annual rainfall, with the average annual rainfall in many areas exceeding . Rainfall intensity can exceed in 24 hours, over much of the park. The high annual rainfall and high intensity, combined with the complex landforms and mountainous terrain creates a large number of steep rivers with the potential to cause significant flooding of low-lying land in the flood plains surrounding the park.

The Karamea River drains to the Tasman Sea through the Ōtūmahana Estuary at Karamea, and is the largest river in the park. It has a catchment area of including its tributaries that represents around 23% of the entire area of Kahurangi National Park. Another major river draining the western areas of the park is the Mōkihinui, with a total catchment area of approximately of which is in the park, upstream of Seddonville.

The Aorere River and its tributaries have a catchment area of draining the Haupiri and Wakamarama ranges in the north of the park. The river flows northwards for into Golden Bay at the town of Collingwood. The Wangapeka River drains eastern regions of the park, and has a catchment area of .

== Fossil records ==
The oldest fossils ever found in New Zealand were identified during an expedition in 1948 in the Cobb Valley at a site that is now within Kahurangi National Park. The fossils were identified as trilobites from the Cambrian (542–490 Ma), the first period of the paleozoic era. A tramping hut near to the location of the find is known as Trilobite Hut.

Fossils of takahē have been found at Mt Arthur and in the Euphrates Cave on the Garibaldi Plateau. The Euphrates Cave skull supports &quot;the hypothesis that takahē were widespread across the South Island&#x27;s subalpine habitats and lowland areas at the time of human arrival in New Zealand&quot;.

== Geology ==
The geology of Kahurangi National Park is complex, and is the most diverse of any of New Zealand&#x27;s protected areas. It includes the best sequence of palaezoic rocks in the country. The complexity of these rock formations suggest that they result from the collision of three former continents.

=== Limestone landforms ===
The park has extensive limestone and marble formations, natural arches, sinkholes and bluffs. It also includes three of New Zealand&#x27;s largest cave systems. The Ellis Basin cave system is the deepest known cave in New Zealand. It has been explored to a depth of 1,024 metres, and its 33.4 kilometres of cave passages make it New Zealand&#x27;s second longest.

== Ecology ==
Kahurangi National Park is known for its biodiversity. A metaphor used in describing the park is that it is a &quot;tectonic ark&quot; that separated from Gondwana around 80 million years ago. There is a particularly high rate of endemism for both flora and fauna, with many notable species that are not found elsewhere. The high level of endemism has arisen as a result of complex biogeographic processes, and indicates that during the Pleistocene ice ages, the area was an important refuge.

=== Flora ===
The complex geology and landforms have allowed unique plant communities to develop in localised environments, leading to a high rate of endemism. The park has exceptional botanical diversity. New Zealand has around 2,400 species of native plants, and over half of these are found in the park, including 67 that are endemic – found nowhere else. The range of species present in the park far exceeds the diversity of native plants in any other New Zealand National Park. Further, Kahurangi National Park has 80% of all New Zealand&#x27;s alpine species.

Notable plants that are endemic to Kahurangi National Park or the immediately adjacent region include:

* &quot;Aciphylla anomala&quot;
* &quot;Aciphylla trifoliolata&quot;

=== Fauna ===

The fauna of the park includes around 18 endemic bird species including some classified as endangered such as the rock wren, kea, blue duck (whio), and species such as the great spotted kiwi and kākā (both classified as vulnerable). Other native birds that can be found in the park include pipit, kererū, the New Zealand falcon, weka, robin, fantail, bellbird, grey warbler, tūī, tomtit, rifleman, fernbird and brown creeper. In addition to the whio, freshwater birds that are found in wetlands and waterways in the park include the Australasian bittern (classified as vulnerable), and the New Zealand scaup. 

The park is also a key habitat for &quot;powelliphanta&quot;, a group of carnivorous native land snails. Of the 64 known species of &quot;powelliphanta&quot;, 29 are endemic — found only in Kahurangi National Park.

Both of New Zealand&#x27;s only native land mammals, the short-tailed bat (pekapeka) and the long-tailed bat (pekapeka tou-roa) have been identified in the park. A new species of skink, &quot;Oligosoma kahurangi&quot; was identified in 2021. It was found in slate scree in montane tussock grassland. It has been classified as Threatened − Nationally Critical.

There is a wide diversity of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates in the park, and many of these are endemic, such as the Mt Arthur giant wētā. The extensive areas of karst and multiple cave systems within the park provided habitat for cave dwelling species. One notable example is the Nelson cave spider &quot;Spelungula&quot;, a monotypic genus of large-clawed spiders that has only been found in caves in the northwestern part of the South Island.

A new species of flightless cricket was discovered in the park in 2023.

&quot;Opacuincola gretathunbergae,&quot; a species of freshwater snail that was discovered in the park in 2016 was named after the activist Greta Thunberg.

== Conservation and human interaction ==

=== Conservation programmes ===

====Ecosystem Management Units====
The Department of Conservation has defined a large number of Ecosystem Management Units (EMU) across New Zealand. These are areas that have been selected for priority attention, based on the ecosystems and species they contain. The EMU areas within Kahurangi National Park are:

* Aorere River 
* Big River − MacKay − Gouland Downs
* Break Creek pakihi
* Cobb
* Devil − Anatoki Ranges
* Grange − Morgan − Grindley tops
* Heaphy
* Hope Range
* Leslie
* Matiri Plateau
* Mokihinui
* Mokihinui Gorge
* Mount Owen
* Ōpārara
* Wharepapa / Arthur Range
==== Pest control ====
As part of the Department of Conservation&#x27;s national pest control programme, aerial drops of 1080 poison are used to control rats in the park as a means of protecting native species. The use of 1080 has been controversial.

==== Flora Stream catchment recovery ====
The Friends of Flora is a conservation volunteer group established in 2001 to help &quot;bring about the protection and/or return of endangered and threatened flora and fauna to the Flora Stream catchment area&quot;. As of 2024, the society has approximately of trap lines to control stoats, protecting around of beech forest and tussockland habitat. The society is focussed on the recovery of whio (blue duck) in the Flora Stream catchment, and the re-introduction of Great spotted kiwi. A wasp eradication programme is in place, and bird monitoring is also part of the society&#x27;s programme.

==== Ōpārara catchment recovery ====
The Ōpārara Source to Sea project was created in 2014 by a group of Karamea locals. In 2023, the project received funding from Lottery Environment and Heritage fund and the Department of Conservation’s Community Conservation Fund to support their work in weed control, predator monitoring, and planting throughout the Ōpārara estuary and catchment over the next three years.

==== Takahē recovery ====
Endangered takahē were reintroduced to the park in 2018, with the release of 18 birds into the Gouland Downs. This was 100 years after takahē became extinct there. The following year, the population had grown to 31, and further releases were planned. There was a set-back in 2020 when 11 birds died. Some may have been poisoned during an aerial drop of 1080 to control predators. In 2021, another 15 young takahē were translocated into the Gouland Downs area.

==== Whio (Blue duck) recovery ====
Conservation initiatives for whio (blue duck) in the park have resulted in a large increase in their numbers since 1998–2000 when surveys of the population were first conducted. As of 2023, there are 846 adult birds, including 335 breeding pairs. This is a 340% increase on numbers found in 2000. Areas of focus for whio conservation within the park include &quot;recovery sites&quot; at the Gouland Downs, Pearse River and Flora Stream, and high priority &quot;security&quot; sites at Ōpārara River and the Wangapeka and Fyffe rivers.

=== Access ===
The main gateway towns for access to Kahurangi National Park are Tākaka, Motueka, Karamea, Tapawera and Murchison. The main Department of Conservation visitor centre for the region is located in Nelson, but the towns adjacent to Kahurangi National Park also have local information centres.

The access road to the Cobb Reservoir is the only road into the interior of the national park.

=== Activities ===
Popular activities in Kahurangi National Park include tramping, mountain biking, rafting and caving.

==== Heaphy Track ====

The Heaphy Track is a popular tramping and mountain biking track in Kahurangi National Park, classified as one of New Zealand&#x27;s ten Great Walks. Named after Charles Heaphy, the track is long and is usually walked in four or five days. The track is open for shared use with mountain bikers in the winter season from 1 May to 30 September each year. The southern end of the track is at Kōhaihai, north of Karamea on the northern West Coast, and the northern end is in the upper valley of the Aorere River southwest of Collingwood.

==== Wangapeka Track ====

The Wangapeka Track is another of the main tramping tracks in the Kahurangi National Park. The route traverses the southern end of the park, from the historic Wangapeka goldfields area west of Tapawera, to the coastal plains of the West Coast at Little Wanganui. The route is long, and crosses the Wangapeka and Little Wanganui saddles, each over in elevation. The track passes through the valleys of the Wangapeka River, Karamea River, Taipō River and Little Wanganui River. The majority of the track is in river valleys and under forest cover, with small sections in tussock land at Stag Flat and the Little Wanganui Saddle. It typically takes walkers 4–6 days to complete the route.

==== Old Ghost Road ====
The Old Ghost Road is an long mountain bike and tramping trail that was part-funded as one of the projects of the New Zealand Cycle Trail initiative. The trailheads are the Lyell Historic Reserve on State Highway 6 in the Upper Buller Gorge, and the Rough and Tumble Bush Lodge, located from Seddonville, northwest of Westport on the West Coast. In 2019, of conservation stewardship land in the Mōkihinui River catchment was added to Kahurangi National Park, including much of the route of the Old Ghost Road trail.

==== Caving ====
Kahurangi National Park is one of the top three locations for caving in New Zealand, and as of 2024, it has the longest and deepest known cave systems in the country. Bulmer Cavern is New Zealand&#x27;s longest cave system, running for in the Mount Owen region. In 2014, a link was found between the Nettlebed and Stormy Pot caves in the Mount Arthur region of the park, creating a system that was around long and deep, and the deepest in New Zealand. At the time of discovery, it was claimed to be the deepest cave in the Southern Hemisphere.

==== River rafting ====
The Karamea River is a highly rated wilderness river for rafting expeditions. A rafting journey is possible over three days, passing through Grade 3 rapids in the upper reaches to Grade 5 rapids in the Karamea Gorge.

== In popular culture ==
Several locations in Kahurangi National Park were used during the making of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film series, including Mount Owen and Mount Olympus. Tolkien tourism has created a demand for helicopter access for visiting these locations. Restrictions on helicopter access are in place to help preserve natural and recreation values.

Kahurangi National Park is the setting for a young adult novel &quot;Night Tribe&quot;, written by Peter Butler, a Nelson-based entrepreneur and author.

<text>AppleShare is a discontinued product from Apple Computer which implements various network services. Its main purpose is to act as a file server, using the AFP protocol. Other network services implemented in later versions of AppleShare included a print server using the Printer Access Protocol (PAP), web server, electronic mail server, and SMB / CIFS server to support file sharing to Microsoft Windows clients.

Earlier versions of AppleShare supported only the AppleTalk network transport protocol but later versions, sold under the name AppleShare IP, allowed use of the TCP/IP protocol stack, as used on most modern networks. AppleShare provided three different protocols for application-layer services: AppleShare File Server, AppleShare Print Server and AppleShare PC.

AppleShare would operate with any physical network medium. Early installations used mainly LocalTalk (and more recently Ethernet), but any physical medium could be used which could be directly or indirectly connected to an AppleShare server system.

Equivalent third-party server products include the open-source Netatalk suite on Unix-like systems, and Services for Macintosh on Microsoft Windows NT and 2000. Versions of Mac OS from System 7 onwards included Personal File Sharing, which is a more limited AFP implementation. The most obvious difference between Personal File Sharing and AppleShare is that the former supports only a small number of concurrent remote users.

All versions of Mac OS were capable of acting as a client to an AppleShare server (via AFP and later SMB) over AppleTalk and TCP/IP protocols, although more recent versions of macOS have gradually removed support for AppleTalk in favor of standard TCP/IP. Third-party vendors created client software such as PC MACLAN (discontinued) and DAVE to implement client functionality on Windows systems. Other developers offered server software that provided similar functionality on Windows Servers such as GroupLogic ExtremeZ-IP and Cyan Software MacServerIP and NetATalk on Linux. Later versions of AppleShare also implemented the SMB and CIFS protocols which are the native file sharing protocols on Windows machines.

Apple discontinued the AppleShare product line following the release of macOS Server, which provides equivalent functionality.

<doc id="653376" wikidata="Q1318354" url="?curid=653376" title="National Park, New Zealand">
<text>National Park (officially Waimarino) is a small town on the North Island Central Plateau in New Zealand. Formerly known as National Park Village, it is the highest urban township in New Zealand, at 825 metres.
The village has great views of Mount Tongariro, Mount Ngauruhoe (Mount Doom in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy), and Mount Ruapehu.

== Toponymy ==
Originally the town was known as Waimarino (calm waters). In 1926, the New Zealand Railways renamed the railway station as National Park. This was to avoid confusion with other Waimarino entities, and also the name had come into common usage from its location close to Tongariro National Park. This change has since been confusing, as there are now many National Parks in New Zealand. 

After a three month nation-wide consultation culminated in 2,582 submissions including from a number of local iwi, residents, the applicant iwi Te Korowai o Wainuiārua. 1,793 supporting the reversion, 785 against and 4 submissions were neutral. The name of the village was reverted (back) to Waimarino on 18 December 2024 (also see the paragraph below starting &quot;In 2023 the Uenuku iwi...&quot;) following a decision made by the Hon Minister Chris Penk.

National Park is a village on the western edge of Tongariro National Park in the central North Island. 

In 2023 the Uenuku iwi/Te Korowai o Wainuiārua proposed renaming National Park back to its original name, Waimarino. The proposal also included changing the name of National Park railway station to Waimarino railway station. The New Zealand Geographic Board supported this move, and started a consultation period on 7 November. By 8 December, they had received over 180 submissions for the two changes. The consultation period ended in February 2024 with the proposal to change the unofficial recorded place name National Park to the official place name Waimarino received 2089 submissions. 489 submissions were received pertaining to the name of Waimarino National Park Railway Station. 

In August 2023, KiwiRail erected new signage at the railway station recognising the original name of Waimarino.

== History ==
The opening of the Main Trunk line in 1908 created a vast opportunity to log and mill the large trees in the native forests, with 30 saw mills and associated bush tramways established in the National Park area alone. With the arrival of caterpillar tractors in the 1930s the extraction process was accelerated with National Park station having one of the greatest throughputs of timber in New Zealand. Today Tongariro Timber is the last surviving mill operating at National Park.

In the 1960s, National Park became the railhead for all the heavy equipment and machinery for the Tongariro Power Scheme development with local pumice roads substantially upgraded to take the heavy traffic.

== Geography ==

=== Setting ===
The town is located just outside the boundary of Tongariro National Park, New Zealand&#x27;s first national park. It is sited next to the North Island Main Trunk railway line and close to the junction of State Highways 4 and 47, halfway between Ohakune and Taumarunui and 45 kilometres southwest of the southern shore of Lake Taupō. It is 20 minutes drive to the country&#x27;s biggest skifields, Whakapapa and 50 minutes drive to Tūroa on the slopes of the active volcano, Mount Ruapehu. To the west is Whanganui National Park.

=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen-Geiger climate classification, National Park has an oceanic climate (Cfb). February is the warmest month, with an average 
temperature of 14.8 °C, while July is the coldest month with an average temperature of 4.5 °C. Due to an altitude of 822 metres, winters are cold, and generally winter afternoons stay below 10 °C. Frosts are common from May to September, although they can occur during the warmer months. Snow is also a common occurrence in the colder months, sometimes accumulating for several days on end. The summer temperatures are moderate due to the altitude of the village, resulting in cool nights and mild to warm days. The mountains around the village are popular for hiking and mountain biking during the summer. The summer afternoon temperatures often exceed 20 °C, and sometimes reaching 25 °C. The wettest month is July, with 225 mm of precipitation, while February is the driest, with an average of 115 mm, making the climate of National Park lean towards a cool-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). Overall, the year-round average temperature is 9.6 °C. 
== Governance ==
The town is administered by the Ruapehu District Council.

<text>Lone Star College–North Harris (formerly North Harris College, NHC) is a public community college, located in unincorporated Harris County, Texas. Part of the Lone Star College System, LSC North Harris offers Associate&#x27;s degrees and program certifications in over 110 fields of study.

==History==
It was established in 1972 by voters in the Aldine, Humble and Spring Independent School Districts, located in the northern parts of Houston and Harris County. Lone Star College–North Harris, opened 1973, serves more than 11,000 students and is the district&#x27;s only source for automotive technology, health information technology, child development and family studies, paralegal studies, medical assisting and pharmacy technology programs. To provide neighborhood centers that serve residents in the greater Greenspoint and South Aldine areas, Lone Star College–North Harris has two full-service satellite centers.

===2013 shooting===

On January 22, 2013, three people were injured in a shooting in the campus courtyard near the library. The gunman was heard arguing with a student named Jody Neal, and initially walked away but returned and pulled out a handgun from his backpack. The gunman shot Neal three times. A maintenance man was hit in the leg by a bullet. The shooter accidentally shot himself in the buttocks area. Witnesses said up to six shots were fired.

Immediately after the shooting, the campus was evacuated and put on &quot;lockdown.&quot; Two individuals with multiple gunshot wounds were in serious condition at Ben Taub Hospital. A fourth person suffered a stroke and was also taken to the hospital. The shooter fled into nearby woods and was followed by officers who later apprehended him.

There were two people detained for further questioning and later that day, Carlton Berry, age 22, who is believed to be the gunman, was charged with aggravated assault in the shootings. These charges were later dropped. Recent Developments

<doc id="653379" wikidata="Q1347943" url="?curid=653379" title="Er (biblical person)">
<text>:&quot;This article discusses close relatives of Judah. Er is also a name listed by the Gospel of Luke&#x27;s version of the genealogy of Jesus&quot;.

In the biblical Book of Genesis, Er ( &quot;watcher&quot;; ) was the eldest son of Judah and his Canaanite wife, the daughter of Shuah. He is described as marrying Tamar. According to the text, &quot;the slew&quot; Er because he was wicked, although it does not give any further details. This Er had two brothers, Onan and Shelah.

The Book of Chronicles verse 4:21 lists another &quot;Er&quot; as being one of Shelah&#x27;s sons.

Some modern bible critics interpret the story of &quot;Er&quot; as an eponymous aetiological myth to explain fluctuations in the constituency of the tribe of Judah, with the abrupt death of Er reflecting the death of a clan; the presence of an &quot;Er&quot; as a descendant of Shelah, in the &quot;Book of Chronicles&quot;, suggests that &quot;Er&quot; was in reality the name of a clan that was originally equal in status to the &quot;Shelah&quot; clan, but was later subsumed by it. The brother — Onan — may represent an Edomite clan named &quot;Onam&quot;, who are mentioned in an Edomite genealogy in Genesis.

These critics have also argued that the Tamar narrative, of which the description of Er is a part, secondarily aims to either assert the institution of levirate marriage, or present an aetiological myth for its origin; Er&#x27;s role in the narrative would thus be as the background to the main plot, his death being the reason for levirate marriage to become an issue. John Emerton, Regius Professor of Hebrew at the University of Cambridge, regards the evidence for this as inconclusive, though classical rabbinical writers argued that this narrative does concern the origin of levirate marriage.

<text>General Sir Frederick Adam (17 June 178117 August 1853) was a Scottish major-general at the Battle of Waterloo, in command of the 3rd (Light) Brigade. He was the fourth son of William Adam of Blair Adam and his wife Eleanora, the daughter of Charles Elphinstone, 10th Lord Elphinstone. He was later a Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, who built Mon Repos, Corfu and other important landmarks in that Protectorate.

==Military career==
He was born at the family home of Blairadam House, just north of Kelty in Fife.

At the age of fourteen in 1795, Frederick Adam entered the British Army. He trained at the artillery school at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. In the same year, he was commissioned as a first lieutenant and in 1796 he was promoted to second lieutenant.

He took part in the campaigns in the Netherlands and Egypt under Sir Ralph Abercromby, he was promoted to the rank of major in 1803 and a lieutenant colonel in 1804. From 1806 to 1811 he was stationed on Sicily. Between 1812 and 1813 he was in Spain fighting in the Peninsular War, where he was severely wounded at Alicante. On 12 April 1813, while commanding the Light Brigade in John Murray&#x27;s expeditionary force, Adam led a brilliant rearguard action against the corps of Marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet at Biar. The following day, his 2/27th Foot battalion inflicted 350 casualties on Suchet&#x27;s 121st Line Regiment during the Battle of Castalla. He was wounded again in an action at Ordal on 13 September 1813.

===Waterloo===

On 18 June 1815, Adam commanded the 3rd British Brigade in Henry Clinton&#x27;s 2nd Division at the Battle of Waterloo. At the crisis of the battle, Adam&#x27;s 1/52nd (Light) Foot performed a left-wheel to enfilade the flank of the French Imperial Guard&#x27;s main attack while the British Guards engaged the head of the column. Under fire from two directions, the French guardsmen put up a brief resistance then fled. After their unsuccessful attack on the British centre, the Guard rallied to their reserves of three (some sources say four) regiments, just south of La Haye Sainte for a last stand against the British. But a charge from Adam&#x27;s brigade threw them into a state of confusion and those which were left retreated towards La Belle Alliance. It was during this stand that Colonel Hugh Halkett took the surrender of General Cambronne.

The French Imperial Guard made a last stand in squares on either side of the La Belle Alliance. General Adam&#x27;s Brigade charged the square which was formed on rising ground to the (British) right of La Belle Alliance and again threw them into a state of confusion. The other square was attacked by the Prussians. The French retreated away from the battlefield towards France. The French artillery, and everything else belonging to them, fell into the hands of the British and Prussians.

==Later life==
From 1817 to 1824, Adam continued his career in the army. Between 1824 and 1832 he was a popular Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands. His commissioning of the construction of public buildings on Corfu was appreciated by the local population. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1831.
From 25 October 1832, to 4 March 1837, he was Governor of Madras and, in 1846, he was promoted to general.

<doc id="653384" wikidata="Q336485" url="?curid=653384" title="Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill">
<text>General Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill, (11 August 1772 – 10 December 1842) was a British Army officer, politician and peer who served in the Napoleonic Wars as a brigade, division and corps commander. Hill became Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1828. Well-liked by the soldiers under his command, he was nicknamed &quot;Daddy Hill&quot;.

==Background and early career==
Hill was born on 11August 1772 at Prees Hall in Prees, Shropshire. He was the second son and fourth child of Sir John Hill, 3rd Baronet, a landowner, and Mary, co-heir and daughter of John Chambré of Petton, Shropshire.

Educated at The King&#x27;s School in Chester, Hill was commissioned into the 38th Foot in 1790. He was promoted to lieutenant on 27 January 1791. On 16 March 1791, after a period of leave, he was appointed to the 53rd Regiment of Foot. He was asked to raise an independent company and given the rank of captain on 30 March 1793.

He served at the Siege of Toulon in Autumn 1793 as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to General O&#x27;Hara from where he carried the dispatches to London. He then transferred to one of Major-General Cornelius Cuyler&#x27;s independent companies on 16 November 1793. In 1794 he assisted Thomas Graham in raising the 90th Foot for which he was promoted to major on 27 May 1794 and to lieutenant-colonel on 26 July 1794. He was promoted to colonel on 1 January 1800.

In 1801 he commanded the 90th Foot when they landed at Abukir Bay in Egypt as part of a force under Sir Ralph Abercromby; Hill was seriously wounded in the action when a musket ball hit his head. In the ensuing weeks Hill helped drive the French forces out of Egypt, and fought at the Battle of Alexandria in 1801. Hill became a brigadier in 1803 and a major-general on 2 November 1805.

==Peninsular War==
During the Peninsular War, Hill commanded a brigade at the Battle of Roliça and also at the Battle of Vimeiro in 1808. He participated in Sir John Moore&#x27;s 1808–1809 campaign in Spain, commanding a brigade at the Battle of Corunna. While serving under Wellington at the Second Battle of Porto, units of Hill&#x27;s brigade launched an impromptu assault across the Douro River that ultimately routed Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult&#x27;s French corps from Oporto.

Hill commanded the 2nd Division at the Battle of Talavera. The night before the battle, Marshal Claude-Victor Perrin mounted a surprise attack, swept aside two battalions of the King&#x27;s German Legion and seized a key elevation. As Hill later recounted, &quot;I was sure it was the old Buffs, as usual, making some blunder.&quot; Nevertheless, he led a reserve brigade forward in the dark. In the short clash that followed, Hill was briefly grabbed and nearly captured by a Frenchman, but his troops recovered the summit. This is the first occasion on which Hill supposedly swore.

Still leading the 2nd Division during Marshal André Masséna&#x27;s 1810 invasion of Portugal, Hill fought at the Battle of Bussaco. In autumn 1811, Wellington placed Hill in independent command of 16,000 men watching Badajoz. On 28 October he led a successful raid on the French at the Battle of Arroyo dos Molinos. On 21 January 1812 he was appointed to the honorary position of Governor of Blackness Castle and on 22 February 1812 he was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword on 4 May 1812.

In May 1812, after the capture of Badajoz, Hill led a second raid that destroyed a key bridge in the Battle of Almaraz. While Wellington won the Battle of Salamanca, Hill protected Badajoz with an independent 18,000-man corps, including the British 2nd Division, John Hamilton&#x27;s Portuguese division and William Erskine&#x27;s 2nd Cavalry Division. He was promoted to lieutenant-general on 30 December 1811.

After the British capture of Madrid, Hill had responsibility for an army of 30,000 men. Hill commanded the Right Column during the campaign and decisive British victory at the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813. Still in corps command, he fought in the Battle of the Pyrenees. At Vitoria and in Wellington&#x27;s invasion of southern France, Hill&#x27;s corps usually consisted of William Stewart&#x27;s 2nd Division, the Portuguese Division (under John Hamilton, Francisco Silveira or Carlos Le Cor) and Pablo Morillo&#x27;s Spanish Division. For his leadership in these battles he was awarded a medal and two clasps on 7 October 1813. He led the Right Corps at the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November 1813.

On 13 December 1813, during the Battle of the Nive, Hill performed what may have been his finest work in his defence of St-Pierre d&#x27;Irube. With his 14,000 men and 10 guns isolated on the east bank of the Nive by a broken bridge, Hill held off the attacks of Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult&#x27;s 30,000 soldiers and 22 guns. He fought the battle with great skill and &quot;was seen at every point of danger, and repeatedly led up rallied regiments in person to save what seemed like a lost battle ... He was even heard to swear.&quot; Later, he fought at the Orthez and Toulouse. Wellington said, &quot;The best of Hill is that I always know where to find him.&quot; He was appointed Governor of Hull on 13 July 1814.

Nicknamed &quot;Daddy Hill&quot;, he looked after his troops and was adored by his men. On one occasion, he provided a wounded officer who arrived at his headquarters with a lunch basket. Another time, a sergeant delivered a letter to Hill. Expecting nothing but a nod of thanks, the man was astonished when the general arranged for his supper and a place for him to stay for the night. The next day, Hill gave him food and a pound for the rest of his journey.

He was also Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Shrewsbury from 1812 to 1814, when he was raised to his peerage as &quot;Baron Hill of Almaraz and of Hawkestone in the county of Salop&quot;, although military duties made him unable to attend the House of Commons prior to his elevation to the Lords. The peerage brought with it a £2,000 pension.

Hill was also colonel of the 3rd Garrison Battalion from 14 January 1809, colonel of the 94th Regiment of Foot from 23 September 1809, colonel of the 72nd Regiment of Foot from 29 April 1815 and colonel of the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards from 19 November 1830.


==Waterloo and later career==
At the Battle of Waterloo Hill commanded the II Corps. He led the charge of Sir Frederick Adam&#x27;s brigade against the Imperial Guard towards the end of the battle. For some time it was thought that he had fallen in the melee. He escaped unwounded, and after the battle wrote to his sister, &quot;I verily believe there never was so tremendous a battle fought as that at Waterloo.&quot; Thereafter he continued with the army in France until its withdrawal in 1818.

He received several awards from allied nations after the battle. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 4 January 1815 and on 21 August 1815 he was made Knight Commander of the Order of Maria Theresa of Austria and Knight of the Order of St. George of Russia. On 27 August 1815 the Dutch King William I made him a Commander of the exclusive Military Order of William. At the coronation of George IV in 1821, Lord Hill bore the Standard of England in the procession from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey. From 1828 to 1842, he succeeded the Duke of Wellington as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. He was also appointed Governor of Plymouth on 18 June 1830 and became &quot;Viscount Hill of Almaraz&quot; on 22 September 1842.

A keen foxhunter, Hill was master of the North Shropshire Foxhounds until 1823. The pack exists to this day and hunts the north of the county, including the grounds of his childhood home, Hawkstone Hall. He later shared the Mastership with Sir Bellingham Graham and Sir Edward Smythe, the hounds at this time being kennelled two miles south-east of Hawkstone Hall. Hill also formed the Hawkstone Otter Hunt around 1800, which was maintained and hunted by successive viscounts. He served as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary at Shrewsbury in 1825, laying the foundation stone of a major rebuild of the hospital in 1827.

He died at Hardwicke Grange, Hadnall, Shropshire on 10 December 1842. He is buried in the churchyard at Hadnall.

==Family==
Hill never married and on his death the baronetcy passed in remainder to Rowland Hill, 2nd Viscount Hill, the son of his deceased brother, John. His brothers Robert, Clement and Thomas, also followed military careers and were present at the Battle of Waterloo.

<text>Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park is located in the South Island of New Zealand and covers 1,185 km2 of mostly mountainous terrain. Adjacent to it lies Craigieburn Forest Park. The park is administered by the Department of Conservation.

== History ==
===Park establishment===
Land in Arthur&#x27;s Pass and the Otira Gorge was originally set aside under the Lands Act 1885 and the Scenery Preservation Act of 1903. This land later became the foundation for the national park.

After the Midland railway line was built, train trips from Christchurch to the Otira Gorge began in 1926 when the Railway Department organised day excursions for hundreds of tourists. Unfortunately, native flowers were popular souvenirs. Some individuals chose to cut down trees to obtain rātā blooms. As a result, there was a large push to establish national park status for the area. Arthur′s Pass National Park was established in 1929, becoming the first national park in the South Island and the third in New Zealand. Underfunding meant that national park status was initially in name only: it took a number of years for the flora and fauna in the park to be fully protected. 

The first park ranger at Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park was Charles Edward Warden, who was appointed in 1929 on the establishment of the park and served until November 1937. Warden lived in a cottage at &#x27;Tin Town&#x27; inside the park and was paid an honorarium for his work, which included marking and maintaining tracks, public relations and advice to visitors about the park, and trying to stop tourists from destroying or removing plants. In 1942, Warden was appointed to the Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park Board of Control. The first full-time ranger at the park, Martin Burke, was employed in 1938.

===Expansion===
In 1901, the Riversdale Flats were gazetted for inclusion in Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park, However, when the park was created in 1929, the 1,000 hectares of the Riversdale Flats were excluded. These were then incorporated into the Mount White Station lease. In 2007, the Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park plan recommended the inclusion of the Riversdale Flats. In late 2021, the status of whether the Riversdale Flats should remain within the Mount White lease or be incorporated into Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park was before the courts.

==Geography==
Arthur′s Pass National Park is bisected by . The road passes through Arthur&#x27;s Pass village and the mountain pass with the same name over the Southern Alps at a height of 920 metres above sea level. The National Park is located within a few hours of driving from Christchurch, the largest city on the South Island of New Zealand.

The park is split by the main divide of the South Island. The eastern side is typically drier and consists of mountain beech forest and wide riverbeds, while the western side contains dense rainforest (which includes mixed podocarp and rata). Much of the geography was formed by ancient glacial action, forming flat bottomed U-shaped valleys. In the middle is a high range, consisting of large, snow-covered peaks and scree slopes.

The park contains the following geographical features:
*A portion of the main divide of the South Island, including the following passes - Harman, Waimakariri Col, Arthur&#x27;s itself, Goat (on the Mingha-Deception route), Tarahuna, Worsley, Minchin and Harper.
*The source of the Waimakariri River, very close the Waimakariri Falls Hut.
*Numerous tributaries to the Waimakariri River, including the Bealey, Poulter, Hawdon, White, Crow and Anti Crow Rivers.
*Numerous tributaries to the Taramakau River, including the Ōtira, Deception and Ōtehake Rivers.
*Mt Murchison at 2400 m is the highest peak within the park.

===Climate===
The coldest temperature recorded in Arthurs Pass was at Bealey on 19 July 1878. 

==Ecology==
=== Fauna ===

==== Whio ====
Seventeen whio (blue ducks) were released into the park in March 2021. There are less than 3,000 whio left in New Zealand.

==== Kākāriki karaka ====
The rarest of New Zealand&#x27;s six kākāriki species, the orange-fronted parakeet is only found in Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park. They are most commonly seen in the Hawdon and Poulter valleys.

==== Kea ====

Kea are regularly seen in both the park and the township. Scotts Track which leads up to Avalanche Peak is often a spot where kea spend time especially close to the tree line. Young kea can often be spotted from the carpark at the viaduct lookout (which is also known as Deaths Corner). This is about 8 km west of Arthur&#x27;s Pass Village. Kea are also common visitors to the local ski fields (Porters, Cheeseman, Broken River, Craigieburn and Temple Basin).

==== Great spotted kiwi (roroa) ====
These can be heard around Arthur&#x27;s Pass Village, but being nocturnal are often difficult to see. There are up to 40 kiwi living in the Bealey Valley.

==== Weka ====
Weka are becoming more common in the western side of the park and occasionally in the Edwards Valley. They had not been sighted from the 1920s until a population was re-established near the Taramakau River in the early 1970s. They have slowly expanded their territory and predator control has allowed the population to expand towards Arthur&#x27;s Pass Village.

==Conservation and human interaction==
=== Visitor centre ===
The first national park visitor centre was built in Arthur′s Pass in 1959, with the help of the Christchurch Wanderers Tramping Club. It was designed by Christchurch architect Paul Pascoe and used local stone to reflect the geology of the national park. As well as Department of Conservation offices, the building housed museum displays on the history of Arthur&#x27;s Pass (including Richard Seddon&#x27;s stagecoach) and archives detailing the history of the National Park. In 2019 the building was declared earthquake prone, and the visitor centre was moved to a portacabin across the road. The cost to upgrade the building to the required standard was estimated at NZ$3 million.

=== Management ===
The Department of Conservation operates a depot, administration and information centre in Arthur&#x27;s Pass village. It has been proposed that facilities should be developed to encourage more visitors to stay the night. Achieving this would require more high-end accommodation and amenities to be built. The report notes that visitors peak over summer. There is a lack of longer day walk options in the park and all–weather amenities. The report also suggested that a cable car would be popular to access the tops of the mountains as would hot pools in the village and an upgraded visitor centre. The Department of Conservation had yet to make a decision on the development of Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park by June 2021.

===Activities===
The park is popular for tramping, skiing, hunting and mountaineering. The mountains around Arthur&#x27;s Pass contain very challenging terrain. The peaks are highly exposed to the weather, the tracks are often very steep, and are often marked only by poles strung across a rocky landscape. Below the tree line the bush is dense and thick. In common with many alpine areas the weather is subject to frequent and sudden change. There have been numerous incidents where trampers have been unprepared for the harsh and variable conditions, and Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park consequently has a reputation as one of the most dangerous national parks in New Zealand.

==== Avalanche Peak ====
Avalanche Peak is the only peak in Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park that is marked by a poled route to the summit. The route is steep and climbs 1,100 metres vertical from the Arthur&#x27;s Pass village. On a clear day, there are good views of the Southern Alps.

==== Devils Punchbowl waterfall ====

The Devils Punchbowl waterfall is located close to the northern end of Arthur′s Pass Village. The short walk to the waterfall and back can be completed in under two hours. The start of the walk is at the footbridge that crosses the Bealey River. The walk takes in beech forest resplendent with birdlife. The track climbs a well maintained track to the base of the 131 metre waterfall, where there is a viewing platform.

==== Mount Rolleston ====

Mount Rolleston is one of the highest peaks in the National Park. it is 2271 meters tall. It is a popular mountain to climb and there are multiple ways to climb it The Rolleston Glacier has melted significantly and the degree of the melt in 2011 would be a 1-in-100-year event under natural conditions, but due to climate change this has become a 1-in-8-year event.

==== Bealey Spur track ====
This is a popular day trip within Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park. It is an easy 2.5 hour walk up to the Bealey Spur Hut. The views over the Wamaikariri Basin and surrounding mountains on a fine day are worth the climb.

==== Waimakariri Basin ====

O&#x27;Malleys track starts at State Highway 73 and follows the Waimakariri River, crossing Turkey Flat to Anti Crow Hut (6 bunks) then on to Carrington Hut (36 bunks). This takes the average fit walker five hours. From Carrington Hut, it is possible to climb Harman Pass (1315m) and cross the Southern Alps. Another trip from Carrington Hut is to continue following the Waimakariri River to Waimakariri Falls Hut, at 1,290 metres above sea level. This hut contains six bunks and various mountaineering trips can be taken from here into the higher mountains of the National Park.

From Anti Crow Hut it is also possible to cross the Wamakariri River and walk up the Crow river towards Crow Hut which sits at 1020 metres above sea level and has 10 bunks.

==== Edwards-Hawdon track ====

This challenging tramping trip travels up the Edwards River, crosses two alpine Passes and then travels down the Hawdon River. The Department of Conservation describes it as &quot;...best of Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park&#x27;s stunning alpine landscapes. The hanging valley at Walker Pass is reached via Taruahuna Pass and the steep climb up to Tarn Col&quot;. This is typically a two night and three day tramp with stops at Edwards Hut (16 bunks) and Hawdon Hut (20 bunks). It is suitable for very experienced tramping groups only.

==== Andrews-Poulter track ====

The Andrews-Poulter is a popular non technical trip on the eastern side of Arthur′s Pass National Park. It crosses two passes, the first being the Casey saddle which is surrounded by beech forest. From there, the track leads to Casey Hut. The second day travels along the river flats of the Poulter before climbing through the beech forest to the Binser saddle and then descending to the carpark near the Andrews shelter in the Mt White road.

The Casey Hut was burnt down in October 2015. Fire investigators found that the fire most likely started at the woodstove or close to the hut entrance. Fortunately, the fire did not spread to the surrounding forest. The hut was originally built in the 1969 and had 16 bunks in it.

In 2019, two anonymous donors provided $250,000 for the hut to be rebuilt. DOC plan to build an 8-metre by 5m hut that will contain 12 bunks.

In August 2020, the replacement Casey Hut was opened. It has some upgrades on the original hut including a more efficient fireplace, double glazing, insulation and solar lighting.

==== Mingha-Deception track ====
This is a well known tramping trip that travels up the Mingha river to Goat Pass. Goat Pass hut is located at the pass and has 20 bunk beds. The second day involves travel down the Deception river and multiple river crossings. It is possible to complete a side trip to Lake Mavis from Goat Pass. This trip is used as the mountain run for the Coast to Coast race in the reverse direction. Pest control (trapping stoats, weasels, rats and feral cats) occurs along this route as part of the Blue Duck Recovery Programme. 

==== Carroll Hut track ====
The Carroll Hut Track is on the West Coast side of Arthur′s Pass National Park, 3 kilometres north of Otira on State Highway 73 at Kellys Creek. The tramp to the hut takes around three hours. It is a step climb through podocarp and broadleaf forest. It provides good views of the Taramakau River on a clear day. The hut itself, has 10 bunk beds and does not have any form of heating. Expect the trip back from the hut to the road to take 90 minutes.

<doc id="653387" wikidata="Q310468" url="?curid=653387" title="Moringa (genus)">
<text>Moringa is the sole genus in the plant family Moringaceae. It contains 13 species, which occur in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia and that range in size from tiny herbs to massive trees. &quot;Moringa&quot; species grow quickly in many types of environments.

The most widely cultivated species is &quot;Moringa oleifera&quot;, native to the foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India, a multipurpose tree cultivated throughout the tropics and marketed as a dietary supplement, health food or source for herbalism practices. The fruit pods of &quot;Moringa oleifera&quot; (&quot;drumsticks&quot;) are consumed as food in many parts of the world, particularly in South Asia. The leaves are commonly used to make tea. Oils are made from the seeds, while powders can be made from the leaves and roots.

== Description ==
&quot;Moringa&quot; is considered one of the most widely diverse genera for its size ranging from small shrubs (&quot;M. pygmaea&quot;) to large pachycaul trees (&quot;M. ovalifolia&quot;).

=== Growth habit ===
&quot;Moringa&quot; contains a wide range of growth habits that may be subdivided into the following categories:

* Bottle (pachycaul) trees: &quot;M. drouhardii, M. hildebrandtii,&quot; &quot;M. ovalifolia, M. stenopetala&quot; 
* Slender trees: &quot;M. concanensis, M. oleifera&quot;, &quot;M. peregrina&quot;
* Sarcorhizal trees: &quot;M. arborea, M. ruspoliana&quot;
* Tuberous shrubs: &quot;M. borziana, M. longituba, M. pygmaea, M. rivae&quot;

=== Leaves ===
Leaves are typically pinnately compound with entire margins.

=== Flowers ===
Flowers may be either bilaterally or radially symmetric. Bottle trees typically produce small, radially symmetric flowers, while other members of the genus produce radially symmetric flowers. Most flowers range in color from white to cream to brown with the notable exception of &quot;M. longituba&quot; which produces bright red flowers.

=== Fruit ===
Fruits are typically elongated, slender, 3-valved &quot;pods&quot; resembling an indehiscent silique (in contrast with a true dehiscent silique). Fruits of &quot;M. oleifera&quot; (drumstick), are a major agricultural product of India, eaten as a vegetable and used for traditional medicine.

=== Phytochemistry ===
&quot;Moringa&quot; contain a number of sulfurous biochemical compounds called &quot;mustard-oil glycosides&quot; or glucosinolates commonly found in cruciferous vegetables of Brassicaceae. Benzyl glucosinolate along with family-specific glucomoringin and glucosoonjnain have been detected from various &quot;Moringa&quot; species and are thought to be the cause of the bitter taste in some &quot;Moringa&quot; leaves.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Higher-level classification ===
The monotypic family, Moringaceae, containing genus &quot;Moringa&quot; has been placed in the order Brassicales according to most modern taxonomic systems, including the APG IV system. Molecular data has suggested a close relationship between Moringaceae and Caricaceae with many identifying a &quot;Caricaceae-Moringaceae&quot; clade within Brassicales. Prior to the availability of molecular data, morphological classification of Moringaceae placed the family in either Brassicales or Sapindales due to the unusual morphological diversity of the family.

=== Classification within the genus ===
&quot;Moringa&quot; contains three widely recognized clades—Donaldsonia, Moringa, and Dysmoringa. Donaldsonia, once thought to be a subgenus of &quot;Moringa&quot;, is a non-monophyletic clade identifiable by radially symmetric flowers and containing the bottle trees &quot;M. drouhardii, M. hildebrandtii,&quot; &quot;M. ovalifolia,&quot; and &quot;M. stenopetala.&quot; The Moringa clade contains all other members of genus &quot;Moringa&quot; (except &quot;M. longituba&quot;) characterized by irregular floral symmetry, perigynous flowers, and short receptacles. The Dysmoringa clade contains the species &quot;M. longituba&quot; which diverges from common Moringa clade characteristics due to its long receptacle and red flowers. The exact phylogenetic relationship between members of &quot;Moringa&quot; continues to evolve with growing molecular data, though the Donaldsonia clade is consistently identified as the basalmost clade within the family.

<text>Poison Idea was an American punk rock band formed in Portland, Oregon, in 1980.

== History ==

=== Formation, 1980s, and 1990s ===
Poison Idea was formed in 1980 by vocalist Jerry A. (aka Jerry Lang). The initial lineup consisted of Jerry A., Chris Tense (bass), and Henry Bogdan (later of Helmet) on drums. Jerry described this early version of the band, in which he sang and played sax, as a &quot;kind of PIL thing&quot; and only lasted a few shows. Jerry and Tense (now on guitar) then hooked up with Glen Estes (bass), and Dean Johnson (drums). Inspired by Black Flag and other early Southern California hardcore acts, they were further influenced by Discharge and Los Angeles&#x27;s Germs. Germs singer Darby Crash&#x27;s influence on singer Jerry A., vocally, lyrically, and philosophically, was considerable, and Poison Idea followed the Germs&#x27; extremist punk ethic. Tense was replaced within a year by Tom &quot;Pig Champion&quot; Roberts (guitar), formerly of the Imperialist Pigs but he would soon return to the band, this time on bass, replacing Glen Estes (later of Portland, Oregon punk/metal band Final Warning).

Poison Idea&#x27;s debut, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Pick Your King&quot; EP, was a short, lo-fi blast of hardcore fury. The jacket featured a &quot;choice&quot; of two kings, Jesus (front cover) and Elvis Presley (back cover).

In 1984, the group released the &quot;Record Collectors Are Pretentious Assholes&quot; 12-inch (the cover features Pig Champion&#x27;s substantial vinyl collection). The record found the band incorporating subtle rock elements into their music, which was further honed on their contributions to two 1985 compilations, &quot;Laughing Boy&quot; on the &quot;Drinking is Great&quot; EP (on which appeared other Oregon punk bands Final Warning, Lockjaw and E-13), and &quot;Typical&quot; and &quot;Die on Your Knees&quot; on the &quot;Cleanse the Bacteria&quot; LP (compiled by Pushead for his own Pusmort label).

With the release of 1986&#x27;s &quot;Kings of Punk&quot; LP, Poison Idea had fully moved beyond the breakneck hardcore of their early records to a potent, driving and ultimately more intricate and sophisticated hardcore/hard rock fusion that incorporated the accessibility of hard rock without sacrificing the power of hardcore.

Following the release of &quot;Kings of Punk&quot;, the lineup changed again and the band added lead guitarist Eric &quot;Vegetable&quot; Olsen and drummer Steve &quot;Thee Slayer Hippy&quot; Hanford from local thrash metal band Mayhem. The band then released &quot;War All the Time&quot; (named for the Charles Bukowski book) in 1987. After the release of &quot;War All The Time&quot;, Chris Tense departed and was replaced by Craig &quot;Mondo&quot; Lower, also formerly of Mayhem. &quot;War All the Time&quot; and the EPs that followed (the &quot;Getting the Fear&quot; 12-inch and the &quot;Filthkick&quot; 7-inch) found them further developing the rock/hardcore sound first established on &quot;Kings of Punk&quot;, which they would hone in 1990 with &quot;Feel the Darkness&quot;.

Membership in Poison Idea continued to fluctuate. Mondo and Vegetable departed. Charley &quot;Myrtle Tickner&quot; Nims joined on bass and on second guitar there was, briefly, Kevin &quot;Kid Cocksman&quot; Sanders and then Aldine Strichnine. They also established their own record label in 1989, American Leather (named for the Germs song), and released two records the same year: a reissue of their 1982 demo &quot;Darby Crash Rides Again&quot; and the &quot;Discontent&quot; 7-inch.

In 1990, the band released &quot;Feel the Darkness&quot;. After the album&#x27;s release, Aldine Strycnine was thrown out of the band, and Mondo returned, this time on guitar, for the 1991 tour. Poison Idea then released &quot;Blank Blackout Vacant&quot; in 1992, and &quot;We Must Burn&quot; in 1993. By this time, their drinking habits and hard living were beginning to catch up with them: the band weighed in at about 1,300 lb. collectively, and Pig Champion in particular was very fat, often having to play sitting down. After the release of &quot;We Must Burn&quot;, Pig Champion announced he was no longer willing to tour. The band&#x27;s final hometown show with Pig Champion was recorded and released as the &quot;Pig&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; CD by Sub Pop in 1996. The group continued on briefly as a 4-piece (as documented on the 1995 &quot;Your Choice Live&quot; release) before calling it quits. Jerry and Thee Slayer Hippy would soon form a short-lived band with Jerry&#x27;s wife, May May Del Castro, called The Gift. A few years later, Jerry resurrected Poison Idea with Dean Johnson, Chris Tense and new guitarist Ian Miller. This lineup appeared on 1998&#x27;s &quot;Learning To Scream&quot; 7-inch but the band dissolved shortly afterwards.

=== Reformation and recent events ===

Jerry and Pig Champion resurrected Poison Idea again with new members in 2000 to record new material. This material was released in 2006 as &quot;The Latest Will and Testament&quot; LP. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, on January 31, 2006, Tom &quot;Pig Champion&quot; Roberts was found dead in his home.

On October 6, 2008, Portland police arrested Steve &quot;Thee Slayer Hippy&quot; Hanford, 39, in connection with a string of pharmacy robberies in late summer.

In 2015, Poison Idea released the LP &quot;Confuse &amp; Conquer&quot; on Southern Lord Records. The album featured the return of former guitarist Eric &quot;Vegetable&quot; Olsen and is, as of 2022, their last studio LP.

After a 19 month absence, the band returned for one show on July 21, 2018, at the Bossanova Ballroom in Portland, Oregon. It was in celebration of the release of &quot;Feel the Darkness&quot; 28 years prior. A remixed and remastered album including B-sides, outtakes, alternate mixes, plus &quot;Live in London&quot;, has been re-issued by American Leather / TKO Records.

In December 2018, Metallica performed a cover of Poison Idea&#x27;s &quot;Taken By Surprise,&quot; a track from &quot;Feel the Darkness.&quot;

It was stated that in Portland, at the Northwest Hesh Fest, September 19–21, 2019, the band would, &quot;reportedly play their last-ever hometown show.&quot;

Steven &quot;Thee Slayer Hippy&quot; Hanford, the band&#x27;s former drummer, died of heart attack at age 50 on May 22, 2020.

In 2022, Jerry A. Lang released a three-part autobiography entitled &quot;Black Heart Fades Blue&quot; through Rare Bird Books.

<doc id="653395" wikidata="Q3986620" url="?curid=653395" title="Dicks (band)">
<text>Dicks were an American punk rock band from Austin, Texas, formed in 1980 and initially disbanded in 1986. After the first breakup, singer Gary Floyd formed the band Sister Double Happiness, with drummer Lynn Perko, then later fronted a project called Black Kali Ma. In 2004, The Dicks reunited and were active until 2016.

The Dicks went through two incarnations in the 1980s, changing its lineup when Floyd moved from Austin to San Francisco in 1983. As a political band with Marxist lyrics during the Reagan Era, they did not shy from controversy. Floyd was one of a handful of openly gay musicians in the 1980s punk scene.

==History==
===Austin lineup (1980–1983)===
Dicks were formed in Austin in 1980 by Gary Floyd, Buxf Parrott, Pat Deason, and Glen Taylor. Their first single &quot;Dicks Hate The Police&quot;, released in 1980, brought them much attention and is now regarded as a classic hardcore punk record. In the song Floyd sings from the perspective of a policeman who abuses his power by targeting minorities and abusing civilians.

Dicks often played shows with fellow pioneering Texas hardcore bands MDC, The Offenders, and The Big Boys; Dicks&#x27; full-length debut was the split album with The Big Boys, &quot;Live at Raul&#x27;s Club.&quot; Dicks were among the first punk bands to address issues of homophobia and sexual identity, as in such songs as &quot;Saturday Night at the Bookstore&quot; and &quot;Off-Duty Sailor&quot;.

===San Francisco lineup (1983–1986)===
In 1983, Floyd left Texas for San Francisco along with Debbie Gordon, the band&#x27;s manager, who was considered a member of the band. Floyd and Gordon, along with new members Tim Carroll, Sebastian Fuchs, and Lynn Perko (formerly of all-women band The Wrecks), formed a second version of Dicks. The LP &quot;Kill From The Heart&quot; was released in 1983 on SST Records and &quot;These People&quot; followed in 1985 on Alternative Tentacles. The group disbanded in 1986, although occasional one-off reunion shows featuring the Austin lineup occurred through the 1980s and 1990s.

===Breakup and continuing influence===
The band remained influential in punk and underground circuits. San Antonio&#x27;s Butthole Surfers had ended their 1984 album &quot;Psychic... Powerless... Another Man&#x27;s Sac&quot; with the cowpunk anthem &quot;Gary Floyd&quot; in tribute to the Dicks&#x27; bandleader. Dicks saw a resurgence in popularity during the popularity of grunge when Seattle band Mudhoney released a cover of Dicks&#x27; &quot;Hate The Police&quot; on Sub Pop Records. Soon after, Chicago noise rockers The Jesus Lizard (three fourths of whom were also from Austin) released their cover version of Dicks&#x27; &quot;Wheelchair Epidemic&quot;.

Gary Floyd later started Sister Double Happiness in San Francisco in 1986. After that band ended he formed and primarily played in Europe with The Gary Floyd Band; an overview of this material, &quot;Backdoor Preacher Man&quot;, is available in the United States. Toward the late 1990s, Floyd played in Black Kali Ma, who released an album on Alternative Tentacles. Floyd later formed the band the Buddha Brothers, while Parrott and Deason went on to play in the Austin neo-bluegrass band Shootin&#x27; Pains and Trouser Trout, while Parrott and Taylor also played in Pretty Mouth. Perko went on to join Imperial Teen.

===Reunion, disbandment and Gary Floyd&#x27;s death (2004–2024)===
In 2004, Dicks began playing regular reunion concerts in Austin and elsewhere. The lineup for the shows consists of the original Dicks, with the exception of Glen Taylor, who died in 1997. His role was filled by three other Austin guitarists: Mark Kenyon, Brian McGee, and Davy Jones. At the 2009 Austin Music Awards show, Jesus Lizard singer David Yow joined the band onstage for &quot;Wheelchair Epidemic&quot;. At the same show, Dicks were inducted into the Texas Music Hall of Fame.

A documentary film, &quot;The Dicks from Texas&quot;, was released in 2015 about the Dicks and Austin, Texas punk scene along with a tribute album, &quot;The Dicks From Texas and Friends&quot;, with 27 bands covering 28 Dicks songs.

The Dicks announced that their final show would be October 30, 2016, at Grizzly Hall in Austin, Texas; however, due to popular demand, a second show was added the day afterward.

On April 30, 2024, Gary Floyd died after a series of health-related issues. He was 71, and was survived by his husband.

<text>Transgressive art is art that aims to outrage or cause a reaction from the observer. The term &quot;transgressive&quot; was first used in this sense by American filmmaker Nick Zedd and his Cinema of Transgression in 1985. Zedd used it to describe his legacy with underground film-makers like Paul Morrissey, John Waters, and Kenneth Anger, and the relationship they shared with Zedd and his New York City peers in the early 1980s.

==Definition==
From an academic perspective, many traces of transgression can be found in any art which is considered offensive because of its shock value; from the French Salon des Refusés artists to Dada and Surrealism. Philosophers Mikhail Bakhtin and Georges Bataille have published works on the nature of transgression.
Transgressional works share some themes with art that deals with psychological dislocation and mental illness. Examples of this relationship, between social transgression and the exploration of mental states relating to illness, include many of the activities and works of the Dadaists, Surrealists, and Fluxus-related artists, such as Carolee Schneemann – and, in literature, Albert Camus&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Etranger&quot; or J.D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.

==Examples==

=== In visual art ===
Transgressive artist Richard Kern began making films in New York City with actors Nick Zedd and Lung Leg in the early 1980s. Some were videos for musical artists, including the Butthole Surfers and Sonic Youth.

During the 1980s, artists such as Dread Scott created art that was so controversial that it ended up in the supreme court. In the case of Scott, United States v. Eichman, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the government to prohibit an artwork that desecrates the American Flag. Another artist, Robert Mapplethorpe, caused the Director of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati to be put on trial for obscenity in 1990. Both cases were ruled in favor of the artists.

Among the most notorious works of transgressive art among the general public have been sculpture, collages, and installation art which offended Christian religious sensibilities. These include Andres Serrano&#x27;s &quot;Piss Christ&quot;, featuring a crucifix in a beaker of urine, and Chris Ofili&#x27;s &quot;The Holy Virgin Mary&quot;, a multi-media painting which is partially made of elephant dung.

Jeffrey Weiss of Artforum considers some of the work of Cy Twombly to be transgressive, citing &quot;drawing as a form of scrawl&quot;.

=== In literature ===
The term can also be applied to transgressive literature as well. Examples include &quot;Trainspotting&quot; by Irvine Welsh, &quot;Blood and Guts in High School&quot; by Kathy Acker, &quot;American Psycho&quot; by Bret Easton Ellis, &quot;Fight Club&quot; by Chuck Palahniuk, &quot;Behead All Satans&quot; by MNM-DR, and J. G. Ballard&#x27;s short story &quot;The Enormous Space&quot;. These works deal with issues that were considered to be outside the social norms. Their characters abuse drugs, engage in violent behaviour, and could be considered sexual deviants.

Transgressive writing can also be reflected in non-fiction, such as in the writing style of Jim Goad.

=== In music ===
Subsequent transgressive artists of the 1990s overlapped the boundaries of literature, art, and music, including GG Allin, Lisa Crystal Carver, Shane Bugbee, and Costes. With these artists came a greater emphasis on life itself (or death) as art, rather than simply depicting a certain mindset in film or music. They were instrumental in creating a new type of visionary art and music, and influenced artists including Alec Empire, Cock E.S.P., Crash Worship, Usama Alshaibi, Liz Armstrong, Lennie Lee, Weasel Walter, Andy Ortmann, and the later work featured in Peter Bagge&#x27;s comic &quot;Hate&quot;.

Rock and roll music has inspired controversy and been transgressive from its inception. As certain other musical genres grew in popularity, some transgressive artists used controversy to make a statement, gain attention, or make a profit (or a combination of these). Among certain musical genres and movements, offending modern sensibilities was an integral part of the music. Musical genres that utilize transgressive themes or music include genres such as shock rock, punk rock, trap, grindcore, black metal and death metal, and various bands within the avant-garde rock or experimental rock genre. Since the late twentieth century, the term has been most frequently applied to artists of musical genres such as hardcore hip hop, gangsta rap, and horrorcore. Eminem was a major subject of such controversy; his early works, most notably &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; (2000), were subjects of backlash surrounding their violent lyricism. Another major figure of criticism was rapper Tyler, the Creator, whose horrorcore-influenced debut studio album, &quot;Goblin&quot;, described graphic violence, which subsequently got his concerts banned from countries such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Though his former negative reputation softened to the masses, Tyler, the Creator and his former hip-hop group, Odd Future&#x27;s music still faced major criticism for graphic lyrics present in their songs in the early 2010s.

Some musical artists use the controversy that surrounds transgressive art as a form of publicity.

=== Recent examples ===

Since the late 1990s, a new group of transgressive artists has emerged, such as the Canadian artist Rick Gibson who made a pair of earrings out of human fetuses and ate a piece of human testicle. In China, several artists have produced transgressive art; these include Zhu Yu (who published images of himself eating what appeared to be a human fetus) and Yang Zhichao (who is known for extreme body art).

<doc id="653403" wikidata="Q3519401" url="?curid=653403" title="Legendary Shack Shakers">
<text>The Legendary Shack Shakers (originally Those or Th&#x27;) are an American rock band from Murray, Kentucky that was formed in 1995 by J.D. Wilkes. The original line-up formed the band out of a shared interest in rockabilly, blues and Western swing. Subsequently, the band gained prominence in the alternative country scene with a sound that encompassed rockabilly, blues, country and punk rock and a lyrical focus on Southern Gothic themes. Over time, the band&#x27;s sound shifted to emphasize country music.

==History==
=== Formation ===
Singer and harmonica player J.D. Wilkes developed an interest in Delta blues music as a teenager living in Paducah, Kentucky as a result of disinterest in the decade&#x27;s popular music styles, familiarizing himself with the music of Muddy Waters, Lightning Hopkins, Brownie McGhee and Charlie Patton before moving backward into older styles of music &quot;to see the roots of the roots&quot;. He formed the Legendary Shack Shakers in Paducah with members of another band, Solid Rocket Boosters, who shared his interest in rockabilly, blues and Western swing; according to Wilkes, the only difference between the two bands was that they have different drummers. The original lineup of the Legendary Shack Shakers consisted of Wilkes, guitarists Nathan Brown and Brian Berryman, upright bassist Todd Anderson and drummer Chris Dettloff -- three of which were Murray State art majors, while the remaining two were a physics major and a psychology major. The band&#x27;s line-up subsequently changed to Wilkes on lead vocals and harmonica, JoeBuck on guitar, Mark &quot;The Duke&quot; Robertson on upright bass, and Pauly Simmonz on drums, all of which alternatively played for local country music acts, most notably with Wilkes and JoeBuck touring as members of Hank Williams III&#x27;s backing band.

===Breakthroughs===
Legendary Shack Shakers&#x27; 2002 album, &quot;Cockadoodledon&#x27;t&quot;, established their prominence in the alternative country scene. After self-releasing their recordings, including &quot;Cockadoodledon&#x27;t&quot;, the self-classified &quot;insurgent country&quot; record label Bloodshot Records reissued &quot;Cockadoodledon&#x27;t&quot; in 2003. After JoeBuck left the band to join Hank Williams III&#x27;s band full time, David Lee became the Legendary Shack Shakers&#x27; new guitarist, and the band signed with Yep Roc Records. 

In 2005, Simmonz left the band and was replaced by Brett Whitacre. that year, Robert Plant asked the Legendary Shack Shakers to open for him on his European tour. The following year, the band opened for Marty Stewart and Travis Tritt in 2006 at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. Subsequently, the band experienced increased mainstream media attention when GEICO featured their song &quot;CB Song&quot; in one of their commercials, and the band&#x27;s song &quot;Swampblood&quot; was included on the soundtrack to the HBO series &quot;True Blood&quot;, earning the band a Grammy Award nomination. 2009 saw the addition of Duane Denison, formerly of the Jesus Lizard, to the line-up. The band released their seventh studio album; &quot;AgriDustrial&quot;, on April 13, 2010 on their own Colonel Knowledge record label. The band would subsequently go on hiatus from 2010 to 2015, after which they reformed with a new line-up consisting of Wilkes on vocals, harmonica and banjo, Robertson on bass, Rod Hamdallah on guitar, and Brett Whitacre on drums, and signed with Alternative Tentacles. 

In 2017, Wilkes released his first solo album, &quot;Fire Dream&quot;, and the Legendary Shack Shakers&#x27; line-up changed to Wilkes, Hamdallah and new rhythm section, bassist Fuller Condon and drummer Preston Corn, before the band recorded and released the album &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot;, a song cycle inspired by Wilkes&#x27; divorce. In 2019, the band performed on the PBS television series &quot;Sun Studio Sessions&quot;, and released an album of this performance under the title &quot;Live from Sun Studio&quot;. In 2020, the band planned to play in Aurora, Kentucky, but the performance was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently delayed until the following year. With a new line-up consisting of Wilkes, guitarist Gary Siperko, upright bassist Fuller Condon and drummer Preston Corn, the band released &quot;Cockadoodledeux&quot;, an album of traditional country and Western songs which includes guest appearances by seven former members of the band, as well as Alternative Tentacles founder Jello Biafra.

== Musical style ==
&quot;Bass Frontiers&quot; wrote that Legendary Shack Shakers &quot;have been billed as everything from rockabilly to gothic country, psychobilly and alt. country&quot;. J.D. Wilkes says that the original incarnation of the Legendary Shack Shakers focused on playing rockabilly, &quot;hillbilly&quot; music, Memphis blues and Western swing. Wilkes described the Legendary Shack Shakers&#x27; music as &quot;Americana rockabilly&quot;; &quot;Vail Daily&quot; said that the band performs a mix of blues, rock, punk rock, and country music. The &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; said that &quot;the southern gothic rockabilly act goes above and beyond much of those genres to throw down their captivating version of hillbilly blues-rock.&quot; The &quot;Kalamazoo Gazette&quot; described the Legendary Shack Shakers&#x27; music as &quot;mutant Southern rock&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&quot; described the Legendary Shack Shakers as a &quot;raucous roots rock band&quot;. According to &quot;City Beast&quot;, the band&#x27;s musical style also encompasses country blues and carnival music.

Wilkes publicly disavowed the psychobilly label the band is sometimes categorized under, considering the genre&#x27;s performers &quot;all pompadour and no substance&quot;, stating of the scene, &quot;These new bands trying to sound like the Cramps or doing the ‘hellbilly’ thing — they only pick up on the clichés of it.&quot; Wilkes took issue with the genre&#x27;s fans&#x27; lack of familiarity with rockabilly artists like Charlie Feathers and dismissed psychobilly performers as &quot;mall punk with pompadours&quot;, calling psychobilly fans &quot;pompadork&quot;. Additionally, Wilkes &quot;openly expressed disdain for alt-country and its musical carpetbaggers&quot;, according to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;. 

Wilkes stated regarding the band&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Southern Gothic&quot;, &quot;I don’t think we’re Goth in the sense of veils and black clothing, people in perpetual mourning, funereal mode. [...] It’s the traditional term, rather than the trendy, Americanized, fad version of it. [...] [Southern Gothic] takes an angle that there’s something grotesque and beautiful in the traditions of the South, the backdrop of Southern living.&quot; Wilkes connects the many styles the band performs to the blues, saying that he considers rockabilly &quot;the white man&#x27;s version of blues&quot; and klezmer to be &quot;the Jew&#x27;s blues&quot;. He described the band&#x27;s performance as being &quot;like a Pentecostal church revival, whipping them into a frenzy and getting them involved in the moment.&quot;

When Duane Denison joined the band, the Legendary Shack Shakers shifted their sound again, with Wilkes calling this new sound &quot;agridustrial&quot;, explaining that it is &quot;kind of chunky industrial patterns, but give it kind of a rustic feel [...] like the sounds of farm implements, that clanking cacophony of rural industry. Kind of like how Johnny Cash used a train rhythm.&quot; Since 2015, the Legendary Shack Shakers have predominantly played country music. 

Wilkes cited as musical influences Little Walter, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Tom Waits, the Louvin Brothers, Dock Boggs, James Harman and Roscoe Holcomb. Outside of musical influences, Gary Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Far Side&quot; cartoon &quot;Cow Tools&quot; inspired the name of one of the band&#x27;s introductions.

<text>In the theory of computation, a branch of theoretical computer science, a deterministic finite automaton (DFA)—also known as [[Finite-state machine#Acceptors (recognizers)|deterministic finite acceptor]] (DFA), deterministic finite-state machine (DFSM), or deterministic finite-state automaton (DFSA)—is a finite-state machine that accepts or rejects a given string of symbols, by running through a state sequence uniquely determined by the string. &quot;Deterministic&quot; refers to the uniqueness of the computation run. In search of the simplest models to capture finite-state machines, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts were among the first researchers to introduce a concept similar to finite automata in 1943.

The figure illustrates a deterministic finite automaton using a state diagram. In this example automaton, there are three states: S0, S1, and S2 (denoted graphically by circles). The automaton takes a finite sequence of 0s and 1s as input. For each state, there is a transition arrow leading out to a next state for both 0 and 1. Upon reading a symbol, a DFA jumps &quot;deterministically&quot; from one state to another by following the transition arrow. For example, if the automaton is currently in state S0 and the current input symbol is 1, then it deterministically jumps to state S1. A DFA has a &quot;start state&quot; (denoted graphically by an arrow coming in from nowhere) where computations begin, and a set of &quot;accept states&quot; (denoted graphically by a double circle) which help define when a computation is successful.

A DFA is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but is often implemented in hardware and software for solving various specific problems such as lexical analysis and pattern matching. For example, a DFA can model software that decides whether or not online user input such as email addresses are syntactically valid.

DFAs have been generalized to &quot;nondeterministic finite automata (NFA)&quot; which may have several arrows of the same label starting from a state. Using the powerset construction method, every NFA can be translated to a DFA that recognizes the same language. DFAs, and NFAs as well, recognize exactly the set of regular languages.

==Formal definition==
A deterministic finite automaton is a 5-tuple, , consisting of
* a finite set of states 
* a finite set of input symbols called the alphabet 
* a transition function 
* an initial (or start) state formula_1
* a set of accepting (or final) states formula_2

Let be a string over the alphabet . The automaton accepts the string if a sequence of states, , exists in with the following conditions:
# , for 
# formula_3.

In words, the first condition says that the machine starts in the start state . The second condition says that given each character of string , the machine will transition from state to state according to the transition function . The last condition says that the machine accepts if the last input of causes the machine to halt in one of the accepting states. Otherwise, it is said that the automaton &quot;rejects&quot; the string. The set of strings that accepts is the language &quot;recognized&quot; by and this language is denoted by .

A deterministic finite automaton without accept states and without a starting state is known as a transition system or semiautomaton.

For more comprehensive introduction of the formal definition see automata theory.

==Example==
The following example is of a DFA , with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s.
 where
*
* and
* is defined by the following state transition table:

The state represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, will finish in state , an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.

The language recognized by is the regular language given by the regular expression codice_1, where codice_2 is the Kleene star, e.g., codice_3 denotes any number (possibly zero) of consecutive ones.

==Variations==
===Complete and incomplete===
According to the above definition, deterministic finite automata are always &quot;complete&quot;: they define from each state a transition for each input symbol.

While this is the most common definition, some authors use the term deterministic finite automaton for a slightly different notion: an automaton that defines &quot;at most&quot; one transition for each state and each input symbol; the transition function is allowed to be partial. When no transition is defined, such an automaton halts.

===Local automata===

A local automaton is a DFA, not necessarily complete, for which all edges with the same label lead to a single vertex. Local automata accept the class of local languages, those for which membership of a word in the language is determined by a &quot;sliding window&quot; of length two on the word.

A Myhill graph over an alphabet &quot;A&quot; is a directed graph with vertex set &quot;A&quot; and subsets of vertices labelled &quot;start&quot; and &quot;finish&quot;. The language accepted by a Myhill graph is the set of directed paths from a start vertex to a finish vertex: the graph thus acts as an automaton. The class of languages accepted by Myhill graphs is the class of local languages.

===Randomness===
When the start state and accept states are ignored, a DFA of states and an alphabet of size can be seen as a digraph of vertices in which all vertices have out-arcs labeled (a -out digraph). It is known that when is a fixed integer, with high probability, the largest strongly connected component (SCC) in such a -out digraph chosen uniformly at random is of linear size and it can be reached by all vertices. It has also been proven that if is allowed to increase as increases, then the whole digraph has a phase transition for strong connectivity similar to Erdős–Rényi model for connectivity.

In a random DFA, the maximum number of vertices reachable from one vertex is very close to the number of vertices in the largest SCC with high probability. This is also true for the largest induced sub-digraph of minimum in-degree one, which can be seen as a directed version of -core.

==Closure properties==

If DFAs recognize the languages that are obtained by applying an operation on the DFA recognizable languages then DFAs are said to be closed under the operation. The DFAs are closed under the following operations.

For each operation, an optimal construction with respect to the number of states has been determined in state complexity research.
Since DFAs are equivalent to nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), these closures may also be proved using closure properties of NFA.

==As a transition monoid==
A run of a given DFA can be seen as a sequence of compositions of a very general formulation of the transition function with itself. Here we construct that function.

For a given input symbol formula_4, one may construct a transition function formula_5 by defining formula_6 for all formula_7. (This trick is called currying.) From this perspective, formula_8 &quot;acts&quot; on a state in Q to yield another state. One may then consider the result of function composition repeatedly applied to the various functions formula_8, formula_10, and so on. Given a pair of letters formula_11, one may define a new function formula_12, where formula_13 denotes function composition.

Clearly, this process may be recursively continued, giving the following recursive definition of formula_14:
:formula_15, where formula_16 is the empty string and
:formula_17, where formula_18 and formula_7.
formula_20 is defined for all words formula_21. A run of the DFA is a sequence of compositions of formula_20 with itself.

Repeated function composition forms a monoid. For the transition functions, this monoid is known as the transition monoid, or sometimes the &quot;transformation semigroup&quot;. The construction can also be reversed: given a formula_20, one can reconstruct a formula_24, and so the two descriptions are equivalent.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
DFAs are one of the most practical models of computation, since there is a trivial linear time, constant-space, online algorithm to simulate a DFA on a stream of input. Also, there are efficient algorithms to find a DFA recognizing:

* the complement of the language recognized by a given DFA.
* the union/intersection of the languages recognized by two given DFAs.
Because DFAs can be reduced to a &quot;canonical form&quot; (minimal DFAs), there are also efficient algorithms to determine:
* whether a DFA accepts any strings (Emptiness Problem)
* whether a DFA accepts all strings (Universality Problem)
* whether two DFAs recognize the same language (Equality Problem)
* whether the language recognized by a DFA is included in the language recognized by a second DFA (Inclusion Problem)
* the DFA with a minimum number of states for a particular regular language (Minimization Problem)

DFAs are equivalent in computing power to nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs). This is because, firstly any DFA is also an NFA, so an NFA can do what a DFA can do. Also, given an NFA, using the powerset construction one can build a DFA that recognizes the same language as the NFA, although the DFA could have exponentially larger number of states than the NFA. However, even though NFAs are computationally equivalent to DFAs, the above-mentioned problems are not necessarily solved efficiently also for NFAs. The non-universality problem for NFAs is PSPACE complete since there are small NFAs with shortest rejecting word in exponential size. A DFA is universal if and only if all states are final states, but this does not hold for NFAs. The Equality, Inclusion and Minimization Problems are also PSPACE complete since they require forming the complement of an NFA which results in an exponential blow up of size.

On the other hand, finite-state automata are of strictly limited power in the languages they can recognize; many simple languages, including any problem that requires more than constant space to solve, cannot be recognized by a DFA. The classic example of a simply described language that no DFA can recognize is bracket or Dyck language, i.e., the language that consists of properly paired brackets such as word &quot;(()())&quot;. Intuitively, no DFA can recognize the Dyck language because DFAs are not capable of counting: a DFA-like automaton needs to have a state to represent any possible number of &quot;currently open&quot; parentheses, meaning it would need an unbounded number of states. Another simpler example is the language consisting of strings of the form &quot;anbn&quot; for some finite but arbitrary number of &quot;a&quot;″s, followed by an equal number of &quot;b&quot;″s.

==DFA identification from labeled words==

Given a set of &quot;positive&quot; words formula_25 and a set of &quot;negative&quot; words formula_26 one can construct a DFA that accepts all words from formula_27 and rejects all words from formula_28: this problem is called &quot;DFA identification&quot; (synthesis, learning).
While &quot;some&quot; DFA can be constructed in linear time, the problem of identifying a DFA with the minimal number of states is NP-complete.
The first algorithm for minimal DFA identification has been proposed by Trakhtenbrot and Barzdin and is called the &quot;TB-algorithm&quot;.
However, the TB-algorithm assumes that all words from formula_29 up to a given length are contained in either formula_30.

Later, K. Lang proposed an extension of the TB-algorithm that does not use any assumptions about formula_27 and formula_28, the &quot;Traxbar&quot; algorithm.
However, Traxbar does not guarantee the minimality of the constructed DFA.
In his work E.M. Gold also proposed a heuristic algorithm for minimal DFA identification.
Gold&#x27;s algorithm assumes that formula_27 and formula_28 contain a &quot;characteristic set&quot; of the regular language; otherwise, the constructed DFA will be inconsistent either with formula_27 or formula_28.
Other notable DFA identification algorithms include the RPNI algorithm, the Blue-Fringe evidence-driven state-merging algorithm, 
and Windowed-EDSM.
Another research direction is the application of evolutionary algorithms: the smart state labeling evolutionary algorithm allowed to solve a modified DFA identification problem in which the training data (sets formula_27 and formula_28) is &quot;noisy&quot; in the sense that some words are attributed to wrong classes.

Yet another step forward is due to application of SAT solvers by Marjin J. H. Heule and S. Verwer: the minimal DFA identification problem is reduced to deciding the satisfiability of a Boolean formula. The main idea is to build an augmented prefix-tree acceptor (a trie containing all input words with corresponding labels) based on the input sets and reduce the problem of finding a DFA with formula_39 states to &quot;coloring&quot; the tree vertices with formula_39 states in such a way that when vertices with one color are merged to one state, the generated automaton is deterministic and complies with formula_27 and formula_28.
Though this approach allows finding the minimal DFA, it suffers from exponential blow-up of execution time when the size of input data increases.
Therefore, Heule and Verwer&#x27;s initial algorithm has later been augmented with making several steps of the EDSM algorithm prior to SAT solver execution: the DFASAT algorithm.
This allows reducing the search space of the problem, but leads to loss of the minimality guarantee.
Another way of reducing the search space has been proposed by Ulyantsev et al. by means of new symmetry breaking predicates based on the breadth-first search algorithm:
the sought DFA&#x27;s states are constrained to be numbered according to the BFS algorithm launched from the initial state. This approach reduces the search space by formula_43 by eliminating isomorphic automata.

==Equivalent models==

===Read-only right-moving Turing machines===

Read-only right-moving Turing machines are a particular type of Turing machine that only moves right; these
are almost exactly equivalent to DFAs.
The definition based on a singly infinite tape is a 7-tuple

: formula_44
where
: formula_45 is a finite set of &quot;states&quot;;
: formula_46 is a finite set of the &quot;tape alphabet/symbols&quot;;
: formula_47 is the &quot;blank symbol&quot; (the only symbol allowed to occur on the tape infinitely often at any step during the computation);
: formula_29, a subset of formula_46 not including &quot;b&quot;, is the set of &quot;input symbols&quot;;
: formula_50 is a function called the &quot;transition function&quot;, &quot;R&quot; is a right movement (a right shift);
: formula_1 is the &quot;initial state&quot;;
: formula_2 is the set of &quot;final&quot; or &quot;accepting states&quot;.

The machine always accepts a regular language. There must exist at least one element of the set (a HALT state) for the language to be nonempty.

====Example of a 3-state, 2-symbol read-only Turing machine====

: formula_53
: formula_54
: formula_55, &quot;blank&quot;;
: formula_56, empty set;
: formula_57 see state-table above;
: formula_58, initial state;
: formula_59 the one element set of final states: formula_60.

<text>In automata theory, a finite-state machine is called a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), if
* each of its transitions is &quot;uniquely&quot; determined by its source state and input symbol, and 
* reading an input symbol is required for each state transition.
A nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), or nondeterministic finite-state machine, does not need to obey these restrictions. In particular, every DFA is also an NFA. Sometimes the term NFA is used in a narrower sense, referring to an NFA that is &quot;not&quot; a DFA, but not in this article.

Using the subset construction algorithm, each NFA can be translated to an equivalent DFA; i.e., a DFA recognizing the same formal language.
Like DFAs, NFAs only recognize regular languages.
NFAs were introduced in 1959 by Michael O. Rabin and Dana Scott, who also showed their equivalence to DFAs. NFAs are used in the implementation of regular expressions: Thompson&#x27;s construction is an algorithm for compiling a regular expression to an NFA that can efficiently perform pattern matching on strings. Conversely, Kleene&#x27;s algorithm can be used to convert an NFA into a regular expression (whose size is generally exponential in the input automaton).

NFAs have been generalized in multiple ways, e.g., nondeterministic finite automata with ε-moves, finite-state transducers, pushdown automata, alternating automata, ω-automata, and probabilistic automata.
Besides the DFAs, other known special cases of NFAs
are unambiguous finite automata (UFA)
and self-verifying finite automata (SVFA).

==Informal introduction==

There are at least two equivalent ways to describe the behavior of an NFA. The first way makes use of the nondeterminism in the name of an NFA. For each input symbol, the NFA transitions to a new state until all input symbols have been consumed. In each step, the automaton nondeterministically &quot;chooses&quot; one of the applicable transitions. If there exists at least one &quot;lucky run&quot;, i.e. some sequence of choices leading to an accepting state after completely consuming the input, it is accepted. Otherwise, i.e. if no choice sequence at all can consume all the input and lead to an accepting state, the input is rejected.

In the second way, the NFA consumes a string of input symbols, one by one. In each step, whenever two or more transitions are applicable, it &quot;clones&quot; itself into appropriately many copies, each one following a different transition. If no transition is applicable, the current copy is in a dead end, and it &quot;dies&quot;. If, after consuming the complete input, any of the copies is in an accept state, the input is accepted, else, it is rejected.

==Formal definition==
For a more elementary introduction of the formal definition, see automata theory.

===Automaton===
An &quot;NFA&quot; is represented formally by a 5-tuple,
formula_1, consisting of
* a finite set of states formula_2,
* a finite set of input symbols called the alphabet formula_3,
* a transition function formula_4 : formula_5,
* an initial (or start) state formula_6, and
* a set of accepting (or final) states formula_7.

Here, formula_8 denotes the power set of formula_2.

===Recognized language===
Given an NFA formula_10, its recognized language is denoted by formula_11, and is defined as the set of all strings over the alphabet formula_3 that are accepted by formula_13.

Loosely corresponding to the above informal explanations, there are several equivalent formal definitions of a string formula_14 being accepted by formula_13:
*formula_16 is accepted if a sequence of states, formula_17, exists in formula_2 such that:
*# formula_19
*# formula_20, for formula_21
*# formula_22.
:In words, the first condition says that the machine starts in the start state formula_23. The second condition says that given each character of string formula_16, the machine will transition from state to state according to the transition function formula_4. The last condition says that the machine accepts formula_16 if the last input of formula_16 causes the machine to halt in one of the accepting states. In order for formula_16 to be accepted by formula_13, it is not required that every state sequence ends in an accepting state, it is sufficient if one does. Otherwise, &quot;i.e.&quot; if it is impossible at all to get from formula_23 to a state from formula_31 by following formula_16, it is said that the automaton &quot;rejects&quot; the string. The set of strings formula_13 accepts is the language &quot;recognized&quot; by formula_13 and this language is denoted by formula_11.

*Alternatively, formula_16 is accepted if formula_37, where formula_38 is defined recursively by:
*# formula_39 where formula_40 is the empty string, and
*# formula_41 for all formula_42.
:In words, formula_43 is the set of all states reachable from state formula_44 by consuming the string formula_45. The string formula_16 is accepted if some accepting state in formula_31 can be reached from the start state formula_23 by consuming formula_16.

===Initial state===
The above automaton definition uses a &quot;single initial state&quot;, which is not necessary. Sometimes, NFAs are defined with a set of initial states. There is an easy construction that translates an NFA with multiple initial states to an NFA with a single initial state, which provides a convenient notation.

==Example==

The following automaton , with a binary alphabet, determines if the input ends with a 1.
Let formula_50 where
the transition function formula_4 can be defined by this state transition table (cf. upper left picture):
:formula_52
Since the set formula_53 contains more than one state, is nondeterministic.
The language of can be described by the regular language given by the regular expression codice_1.

All possible state sequences for the input string &quot;1011&quot; are shown in the lower picture.

The string is accepted by since one state sequence satisfies the above definition; it does not matter that other sequences fail to do so.
The picture can be interpreted in a couple of ways:
* In terms of the above &quot;lucky-run&quot; explanation, each path in the picture denotes a sequence of choices of .
* In terms of the &quot;cloning&quot; explanation, each vertical column shows all clones of at a given point in time, multiple arrows emanating from a node indicate cloning, a node without emanating arrows indicating the &quot;death&quot; of a clone.
The feasibility to read the same picture in two ways also indicates the equivalence of both above explanations.
* Considering the first of the above formal definitions, &quot;1011&quot; is accepted since when reading it may traverse the state sequence formula_54, which satisfies conditions 1 to 3. 
* Concerning the second formal definition, bottom-up computation shows that formula_55, hence formula_56, hence formula_57, hence formula_58, and hence formula_59; since that set is not disjoint from formula_60, the string &quot;1011&quot; is accepted.

In contrast, the string &quot;10&quot; is rejected by (all possible state sequences for that input are shown in the upper right picture), since there is no way to reach the only accepting state, , by reading the final 0 symbol. While can be reached after consuming the initial &quot;1&quot;, this does not mean that the input &quot;10&quot; is accepted; rather, it means that an input string &quot;1&quot; would be accepted.

==Equivalence to DFA==

A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can be seen as a special kind of NFA, in which for each state and symbol, the transition function has exactly one state. Thus, it is clear that every formal language that can be recognized by a DFA can be recognized by an NFA.

Conversely, for each NFA, there is a DFA such that it recognizes the same formal language. The DFA can be constructed using the powerset construction.

This result shows that NFAs, despite their additional flexibility, are unable to recognize languages that cannot be recognized by some DFA. It is also important in practice for converting easier-to-construct NFAs into more efficiently executable DFAs. However, if the NFA has &quot;n&quot; states, the resulting DFA may have up to 2&quot;n&quot; states, which sometimes makes the construction impractical for large NFAs.

==NFA with ε-moves==

Nondeterministic finite automaton with ε-moves (NFA-ε) is a further generalization to NFA. In this kind of automaton, the transition function is additionally defined on the empty string ε. A transition without consuming an input symbol is called an ε-transition and is represented in state diagrams by an arrow labeled &quot;ε&quot;. ε-transitions provide a convenient way of modeling systems whose current states are not precisely known: i.e., if we are modeling a system and it is not clear whether the current state (after processing some input string) should be q or q&#x27;, then we can add an ε-transition between these two states, thus putting the automaton in both states simultaneously.

===Formal definition===
An &quot;NFA-ε&quot; is represented formally by a 5-tuple, formula_1, consisting of
* a finite set of states formula_2
* a finite set of input symbols called the alphabet formula_3
* a transition function formula_64
* an &quot;initial&quot; (or &quot;start&quot;) state formula_6
* a set of states formula_31 distinguished as &quot;accepting&quot; (or &quot;final&quot;) &quot;states&quot; formula_7.

Here, formula_8 denotes the power set of formula_2 and formula_40 denotes empty string.

===ε-closure of a state or set of states===

For a state formula_71, let formula_72 denote the set of states that are reachable from formula_73 by following ε-transitions in the transition function formula_4, i.e.,
formula_75 if there is a sequence of states formula_76 such that
* formula_77,
* formula_78 for each formula_79, and
* formula_80.

formula_72 is known as the epsilon closure, (also ε-closure) of formula_73.

The ε-closure of a set formula_83 of states of an NFA is defined as the set of states reachable from any state in formula_83 following ε-transitions. Formally, for formula_85, define formula_86.

===Extended transition function===
Similar to NFA without ε-moves, the transition function formula_4 of an NFA-ε can be extended to strings.
Informally, formula_88 denotes the set of all states the automaton may have reached when starting in state formula_71 and reading the string formula_90
The function formula_38 can be defined recursively as follows.
* formula_92, for each state formula_93 and where formula_94 denotes the epsilon closure;
:&quot;Informally:&quot; Reading the empty string may drive the automaton from state formula_73 to any state of the epsilon closure of formula_96
* formula_97 for each state formula_93 each string formula_99 and each symbol formula_100
:&quot;Informally:&quot; Reading the string formula_16 may drive the automaton from state formula_73 to any state formula_44 in the recursively computed set formula_88; after that, reading the symbol formula_105 may drive it from formula_44 to any state in the epsilon closure of formula_107 

The automaton is said to accept a string formula_16 if 
:formula_109 
that is, if reading formula_16 may drive the automaton from its start state formula_23 to some accepting state in formula_112

===Example===

Let formula_13 be a NFA-ε, with a binary alphabet, that determines if the input contains an even number of 0s or an even number of 1s. Note that 0 occurrences is an even number of occurrences as well.

In formal notation, let formula_114 where
the transition relation formula_4 can be defined by this state transition table:

formula_13 can be viewed as the union of two DFAs: one with states formula_117 and the other with states formula_118. 
The language of formula_13 can be described by the regular language given by this regular expression formula_120.
We define formula_13 using ε-moves but formula_13 can be defined without using ε-moves.

===Equivalence to NFA===

To show NFA-ε is equivalent to NFA, first note that NFA is a special case of NFA-ε, so it remains to show for every NFA-ε, there exists an equivalent NFA.

Given an NFA with epsilon moves formula_123
define an NFA formula_124 where
:formula_125
and
:formula_126 for each state formula_71 and each symbol formula_128 using the extended transition function formula_129 defined above.

One has to distinguish the transition functions of formula_13 and formula_131 viz. formula_4 and formula_133 and their extensions to strings, formula_4 and formula_135 respectively.
By construction, formula_136 has no ε-transitions.

One can prove that formula_137 for each string formula_138, by induction on the length of formula_139

Based on this, one can show that formula_140 if, and only if, formula_141 for each string formula_142
* If formula_143 this follows from the definition of formula_144
* Otherwise, let formula_145 with formula_146 and formula_100 
:From formula_137 and formula_149 we have formula_150 we still have to show the &quot;formula_151&quot; direction.
:*If formula_152 contains a state in formula_153 then formula_154 contains the same state, which lies in formula_31.
:*If formula_152 contains formula_157 and formula_158 then formula_154 also contains a state in formula_160 viz. formula_161
:*If formula_152 contains formula_157 and formula_164 but formula_165 then there exists a state in formula_166, and the same state must be in formula_167

Since NFA is equivalent to DFA, NFA-ε is also equivalent to DFA.

==Closure properties==
The set of languages recognized by NFAs is closed under the following operations. These closure operations are used in Thompson&#x27;s construction algorithm, which constructs an NFA from any regular expression. They can also be used to prove that NFAs recognize exactly the regular languages.

*Union (cf. picture); that is, if the language &quot;L&quot;1 is accepted by some NFA &quot;A&quot;1 and &quot;L&quot;2 by some &quot;A&quot;2, then an NFA &quot;A&quot;u can be constructed that accepts the language &quot;L&quot;1∪&quot;L&quot;2.
*Intersection; similarly, from &quot;A&quot;1 and &quot;A&quot;2 an NFA &quot;A&quot;i can be constructed that accepts &quot;L&quot;1∩&quot;L&quot;2.
*Concatenation
*Negation; similarly, from &quot;A&quot;1 an NFA &quot;A&quot;n can be constructed that accepts Σ*\&quot;L&quot;1.
*Kleene closure

Since NFAs are equivalent to nondeterministic finite automaton with ε-moves (NFA-ε), the above closures are proved using closure properties of NFA-ε.

==Properties==
The machine starts in the specified initial state and reads in a string of symbols from its alphabet. The automaton uses the state transition function Δ to determine the next state using the current state, and the symbol just read or the empty string. However, &quot;the next state of an NFA depends not only on the current input event, but also on an arbitrary number of subsequent input events. Until these subsequent events occur it is not possible to determine which state the machine is in&quot;. If, when the automaton has finished reading, it is in an accepting state, the NFA is said to accept the string, otherwise it is said to reject the string.

The set of all strings accepted by an NFA is the language the NFA accepts. This language is a regular language.

For every NFA a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can be found that accepts the same language. Therefore, it is possible to convert an existing NFA into a DFA for the purpose of implementing a (perhaps) simpler machine. This can be performed using the powerset construction, which may lead to an exponential rise in the number of necessary states. For a formal proof of the powerset construction, please see the Powerset construction article.

==Implementation==
There are many ways to implement a NFA:
* Convert to the equivalent DFA. In some cases this may cause exponential blowup in the number of states.
* Keep a set data structure of all states which the NFA might currently be in. On the consumption of an input symbol, unite the results of the transition function applied to all current states to get the set of next states; if ε-moves are allowed, include all states reachable by such a move (ε-closure). Each step requires at most &quot;s&quot;2 computations, where &quot;s&quot; is the number of states of the NFA. On the consumption of the last input symbol, if one of the current states is a final state, the machine accepts the string. A string of length &quot;n&quot; can be processed in time &quot;O&quot;(&quot;ns&quot;2), and space &quot;O&quot;(&quot;s&quot;).
* Create multiple copies. For each &quot;n&quot; way decision, the NFA creates up to &quot;n&quot;−1 copies of the machine. Each will enter a separate state. If, upon consuming the last input symbol, at least one copy of the NFA is in the accepting state, the NFA will accept. (This, too, requires linear storage with respect to the number of NFA states, as there can be one machine for every NFA state.)
* Explicitly propagate tokens through the transition structure of the NFA and match whenever a token reaches the final state. This is sometimes useful when the NFA should encode additional context about the events that triggered the transition. (For an implementation that uses this technique to keep track of object references have a look at Tracematches.)

== Complexity ==

* One can solve in linear time the emptiness problem for NFA, i.e., check whether the language of a given NFA is empty. To do this, we can simply perform a depth-first search from the initial state and check if some final state can be reached.
* It is PSPACE-complete to test, given an NFA, whether it is &quot;universal&quot;, i.e., if there is a string that it does not accept. As a consequence, the same is true of the &quot;inclusion problem&quot;, i.e., given two NFAs, is the language of one a subset of the language of the other.
* Given as input an NFA &quot;A&quot; and an integer n, the counting problem of determining how many words of length &quot;n&quot; are accepted by &quot;A&quot; is intractable; it is #P-hard. In fact, this problem is complete (under parsimonious reductions) for the complexity class SpanL.

==Application of NFA==
NFAs and DFAs are equivalent in that if a language is recognized by an NFA, it is also recognized by a DFA and vice versa. The establishment of such equivalence is important and useful. It is useful because constructing an NFA to recognize a given language is sometimes much easier than constructing a DFA for that language. It is important because NFAs can be used to reduce the complexity of the mathematical work required to establish many important properties in the theory of computation. For example, it is much easier to prove closure properties of regular languages using NFAs than DFAs.

<doc id="653410" wikidata="Q411936" url="?curid=653410" title="Lethal white syndrome">
<text>Lethal white syndrome (LWS), also called overo lethal white syndrome (OLWS), lethal white overo (LWO), and overo lethal white foal syndrome (OLWFS), is an autosomal genetic disorder most prevalent in the American Paint Horse. Affected foals are born after the full 11-month gestation and externally appear normal, though they have all-white or nearly all-white coats and blue eyes. However, internally, these foals have a nonfunctioning colon. Within a few hours, signs of colic appear; affected foals die within a few days. Because the death is often painful, such foals are often humanely euthanized once identified. The disease is particularly devastating because foals are born seemingly healthy after being carried to full term.

The disease has a similar cause to Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease in humans. A mutation in the middle of the endothelin receptor type B (&quot;EDNRB&quot;) gene causes lethal white syndrome when homozygous. Carriers, which are heterozygous—that is, have one copy of the mutated allele, but themselves are healthy—can now be reliably identified with a DNA test. Both parents must be carriers of one copy of the LWS allele for an affected foal to be born.

Horses that are heterozygous for the gene that causes lethal white syndrome often exhibit a spotted coat color pattern commonly known as &quot;frame&quot; or &quot;frame overo&quot;. Coat color alone does not always indicate the presence of LWS or carrier status, however. The frame pattern may be minimally expressed or masked by other spotting patterns. Also, different genetic mechanisms produce healthy white foals and have no connection to LWS, another reason for genetic testing of potential breeding stock. Some confusion also occurs because the term overo is used to describe a number of other non tobiano spotting patterns besides the frame pattern. Though no treatment or cure for LWS foals is known, a white foal without LWS that appears ill may have a treatable condition.

==Signs==
Unlike the premature births and stillborn or weak foals of some coat color dilution lethals, foals born with lethal white syndrome appear to be fully formed and normal. The coat is entirely or almost entirely white with underlying unpigmented pink skin. If pigmented regions are present, they may be any color, and are most common around the muzzle, underside of the barrel, and the hindquarters or tail. The eyes are blue. A few lethal white foals have been shown to be deaf.

Healthy foals pass meconium, the first stool, soon after birth. Some healthy foals may require an enema to assist this process, but the meconium of LWS foals is impacted high in the intestine, and never appears, even with the use of enemas. Signs of colic begin to appear within the first day, and all foals with LWS die within the first few days of life. The painful and inevitable death that follows usually prompts veterinarians and owners to euthanize foals suspected of having lethal white syndrome.

Death is caused by an underdeveloped part of the digestive system. The large intestine of the horse comprises the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. Necropsies on LWS foals reveal a pale, underdeveloped colon and intestinal obstruction (impaction). Samples of affected tissue show a lack of nerves that allow the intestine to move material through the digestive system, a condition called intestinal agangliosis.

Closer examination of the skin and hair shows both to be unpigmented, and most hair follicles are inactive and many are devoid of hair altogether. All LWS foals test homozygous for a genetic abnormality.

==Inheritance and expression==
Genetic conditions which affect more than one physical trait—in the case of lethal white syndrome, both pigment cells and enteric nerve cells—are termed pleiotropic. The unusual instance of pleiotropy in LWS foals suggested early on that the syndrome was related to an important section of embryonic tissue called the neural crest. As the name suggests, the stem cells of the neural crest are precursors to nerve cells. Another cell type that descends from neural crest cells are melanocytes, pigment-producing cells found in hair follicles and skin. The migration of nerve- and melanocyte-precursors from the top of the embryo to their eventual destinations is carefully controlled by regulatory genes.

Such regulatory genes include endothelin receptor type B (&quot;EDNRB&quot;). A mutation in the middle of the &quot;EDNRB&quot; gene, Ile118Lys, causes lethal white syndrome. In this mutation, a &quot;typo&quot; in the DNA mistakes isoleucine for lysine. The resulting EDNRB protein is unable to fulfill its role in the development of the embryo, limiting the migration of the melanocyte and enteric neuron precursors.

In the case of LWS, a single copy of the &quot;EDNRB&quot; mutation, the heterozygous state, produces an identifiable trait, but with a very different outcome from the homozygous state.

To produce a foal with LWS, both parents must be heterozygotes or carriers of the mutated gene. Without genetic testing, some carriers are misidentified as having white markings due to another gene, while some are even classified as solids.

The presence of this gene in a variety of horse populations in North America suggests that the mutation occurred in early American history, perhaps in a Spanish-type horse.

===Heterozygotes===

Horses heterozygous for the Ile118Lys mutation on the equine &quot;EDNRB&quot; gene—carriers of lethal white syndrome—usually exhibit a white-spotting pattern called &quot;frame&quot;, or &quot;frame overo&quot;. Frame is characterized by jagged, sharply defined, horizontally oriented white patches that run along the horse&#x27;s neck, shoulder, flank, and hindquarters. The frame pattern by itself does not produce white markings that cross the back, or affect the legs or tail. It does, however, often produce bald faces and blue eyes. The term &quot;frame&quot; describes the effect of viewing a frame-patterned horse from the side: the white markings appear to be &quot;framed&quot; by a dark-colored border. To date, animals which are heterozygous carriers do not exhibit health concerns associated with carrier-only status.

Not all horses with the heterozygous mutation exactly fit the standard visual description. A horse with the Ile118Lys mutation on &quot;EDNRB&quot; that is not readily identified as frame-patterned is called a cryptic frame. In addition to cryptic frames, a significant proportion of horses with the frame phenotype are visually misidentified, even in clinical settings. One study found from a group of visually inspected registered Paints, 18% of breeding stock solids and 35% of bald-faced horses were actually frames. However, over one-quarter of Paints registered in the &quot;overo&quot; category were not frames, and conversely, 10% of horses registered as tobiano also carried frame genetics. The difficulty in accurately identifying frames has contributed to the accidental breeding of LWS foals.

Minimally marked horses heterozygous for the Ile118Lys mutation are not uncommon: one DNA-tested Thoroughbred has white markings limited to a bottom-heavy blaze and two socks below the knee. A Quarter Horse mare tested positive for the gene after she and a frame Paint stallion produced a LWS foal; the mare&#x27;s markings were a thin blaze with a disconnected white spot in the right nostril, with no other white markings. One major study identified two miniature horses that were completely unmarked, but were positive for the Ile118Lys gene.

Multiple theories are given for this. Variability in the percentage of individuals with a specific genotype that express an associated phenotype is called penetrance, and this may simply be evidence of variable penetrance. Several research groups have suggested that other, &quot;suppressor&quot; genes may limit the expression of frame-pattern white spotting.

On the other end of the spectrum, some white-spotted horses are so extensively marked that the character of the frame pattern is masked. In particular, the tobiano pattern, a dominant gene, is epistatic to overo. Other white-spotting genes include splashed white or &quot;splash&quot;, sabino, and &quot;calico&quot;. Any combination, or all, of these white-spotting genes can act together to produce horses with so much white that the presence of frame cannot be determined without a DNA test.

Ambiguous terminology has also contributed to the confusion surrounding this disease. Currently, the American Paint Horse Association categorizes horses as tobiano, solid, &quot;overo&quot;, and tovero. The association breaks down &quot;overo&quot; into three categories: Frame, Splash and Sabino. In the past, &quot;overo&quot; was used even more loosely, to refer to spotted animals that were &quot;Paint, but not tobiano&quot;. However, no fewer than four—and likely many more—genetically distinct patterns are included under the term &quot;overo&quot;. To be categorized as &quot;overo&quot; by the APHA, a horse must fit a written description: white spotting does not cross the back, at least one solid-colored leg, solid tail, face markings, and irregular, scattered, or splashy white patches. To further complicate matters, various Sabino patterns also appear in some horse breeds that do not carry genetics for frame or any other spotting pattern.

Likewise, official classification of a horse as an unspotted solid is based not on genetic testing, but on a visual description. Horses carrying genetics for frame and other white-spotting patterns may be so minimally marked as to lack the registry&#x27;s minimum requirements for white. This helps to account for allegedly solid horses producing spotted offspring, called cropouts.

The long-standing practice of categorizing Paint horses in this manner contributed to the incorporation of the word &quot;overo&quot; into some of the titles used to describe the disease, such as overo lethal white foal syndrome. However, &quot;overo&quot; refers to several genetically unrelated white-spotting patterns, and only the frame pattern is indicative of the syndrome. The confusion about the nature of LWS is then furthered by statements such as &quot;there are many overos that do not carry the lethal allele&quot;, which is technically correct, but only because the term &quot;overo&quot; also encompasses splash and sabino patterns, as well as frame.

===Homozygotes===
Homozygotes for the Ile118Lys mutation on the equine endothelin receptor type B gene have lethal white syndrome. In any crossing of two carrier parents, the statistical probability of producing a solid-colored, living foal is 25%; a 50% chance exists for a frame-patterned, living foal; and a 25% chance exists of a LWS foal.

===Producing frame color patterns without producing lethal white===
Spotted coat colors, including frame, are popular and sought-after by breeders. While many lethal white syndrome foals are accidentally produced when breeders cross two untested cryptic frames, or a known frame and a cryptic frame, some are produced by the intentional breeding of two known frames, whether out of ignorance or indifference. Producing a foal with LWS is now completely avoidable, because most major animal genetics labs now offer the DNA test for it. Whether a horse visually appears to have the frame pattern or not, testing horses of frame or &quot;overo&quot; lineage is highly recommended.
The statistical likelihood of producing a living, frame-patterned foal by crossing two frames is 50%, the same odds of producing a living, frame-patterned foal from a frame-to-nonframe breeding which carries no risk of producing a lethal white syndrome foal. Therefore, breeding two frame overos conveys no benefit to breeders hoping to produce another frame overo.

===Dominant or recessive?===

Lethal white syndrome has been described by researchers as both dominantly and recessively inherited. Lethal white syndrome is described as recessive because heterozygotes (written &quot;Oo&quot; or &quot;N/O&quot;) are not affected by intestinal agangliosis. However, if the frame pattern trait is included, inheritance of the trait follows an incomplete dominant pattern. The concept of &quot;recessive&quot; and &quot;dominant&quot; antedate molecular biology and technically apply only to traits, not to genes themselves. In pleiotropic conditions, such as LWS, the application of &quot;recessive&quot; or &quot;dominant&quot; can be ambiguous.

A separate issue is the nomenclature applied to the frame pattern itself. While it follows a dominant pattern of inheritance, deviations occur. The majority of horses with the Ile118Lys mutation do exhibit the recognizable frame pattern, but a small percentage are too modestly marked to be classified as &quot;spotted&quot; by breed registries. Such &quot;solid&quot; horses, bred to a solid partner, can produce classically marked frames. The &quot;crop-out&quot; phenomenon can make frame appear to follow a recessive mode of inheritance.

==Prevalence==
The gene for LWS is most common in the American Paint Horse, but occurs in any breed that may carry frame genetics, including American Quarter Horses, Appaloosas, Thoroughbreds, Morgan horses, miniature horses, Tennessee Walking Horses, and mustangs, as well as horses that are descended from these breeds. Only two Morgan horses have been identified as frame overos. Breeds that do not carry genes for the frame pattern also do not carry LWS.

==Lethal white mimics==

Not all white, blue-eyed foals are affected with LWS. Other genes can produce healthy pink-skinned, blue-eyed horses with a white or very light cream-colored coat. For a time, some of these completely white horses were called &quot;living lethals&quot;, but this is a misnomer. Before reliable information and the DNA test were available to breeders, perfectly healthy, white-coated, blue-eyed foals were sometimes euthanized for fear they were lethal whites, an outcome which can be avoided today with testing and a better understanding of coat color genetics or even waiting 12 hours or so for the foal to develop clinical signs. The availability of testing also allows a breeder to determine if a white-coated, blue-eyed foal that becomes ill is an LWS foal that requires euthanasia or a non-LWS foal with a simple illness that may be successfully treated.
* Double-cream dilutes such as cremello, perlinos, and smoky creams, have cream-colored coats, blue eyes, and pink skin. The faint cream pigmentation of their coats can be distinguished from the unpigmented white markings and underlying unpigmented pink skin. A similar-looking &quot;pseudo double dilute&quot; can be produced with help from the pearl gene or &quot;barlink factor&quot; or the champagne gene.
* The combination of tobiano with other white-spotting patterns can produce white or nearly white horses, which may have blue eyes.
* Sabino horses that are homozygous for the sabino-1 (&quot;Sb-1&quot;) gene are often called &quot;sabino-white&quot;, and are all- or nearly all-white. Not all sabino horses carry &quot;Sb-1&quot;.
* Dominant white genetics are not thoroughly understood, but are characterized by all- or nearly all-white coats.

==Analogous conditions==
From very early in research into its genetics, LWS has been compared to Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease in humans, which is also caused by mutations on the &quot;EDNRB&quot; gene. Various polymorphisms on this gene result in intestinal agangliosis, in some cases attended by unusual pigmentation of the skin and eyes, and deafness. The occasionally attendant pigmentation condition in humans is called Waardenburg-Shah syndrome.

The terms &quot;piebald-lethal&quot; and &quot;spotting lethal&quot; apply to similar conditions in mice and rats, respectively, both caused by mutations on the &quot;EDNRB&quot; gene. Only lethal in the homozygous state, the mutations are associated with white-spotted coats, deafness, and megacolon caused by intestinal agangliosis.

<text>Mont Aiguille () is a mountain in the Vercors Massif of the French Prealps, located south of Grenoble, in the commune of Chichilianne, and the département of Isère. The mountain, known as one of the Seven Wonders of Dauphiné, is a relatively flat limestone mesa surrounded by steep cliffs. The mountain lies within an area designated in 1970 as the Vercors Regional Natural Park. Mont Aiguille&#x27;s limestone cliffs, especially on the northwest side, are popular with climbers. Its first climb in 1492 was said to mark the birth of mountaineering.

==Topography and geography==
Mont Aiguille is a mesa eroded from the Vercors Plateau in the drainage basin of the Rhône. It is surrounded by steep cliffs and has a height of and a clean prominence of . The surrounding terrain is difficult enough to warrant a technical climb as the easiest method of ascent. The mountain is capped with meadows botanically similar to those on the Vercors High Plateau, but beneath the cliffs there are extensive forests. The mountain lies within the Vercors Regional Natural Park and is in the département of Isère. The nearest access by rail is in the village of Saint-Martin-de-Clelles and by road is from the north via the Col de La Bâtie.

==Geomorphology and geology==

Geomorphologically, the mountain is a mesa-like outlier, that is to say, the remains of a plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks (the so-called &quot;Jasneuf fault&quot;) between the current summit and the Vercors high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres, leaving the peak standing on its own. This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille, including the cliffs, which are almost identical to those on the eastern edge of the Vercors Plateau such as those on the edge of the Grand Veymont, which is the highest point of the range. Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit plateau, which are similar to those to the west on the rest of the Vercors plateau.

Mont Aiguille is a limestone mesa, previously connected to the main body of the high plateau of the Vercors Massif. The summit is made up of lower Barremian strata, deposited during the Cretaceous period. This is the same as the plateau to the west, but not as the immediate environs: the lower slopes are composed of older Hauterivian strata. As easily observed, the bedding planes are all roughly level, although there is some inclination down to the north-east.

==History==
According to Roman legend, the mountain was torn from the rest of the Vercors when a hunter named Ibicus saw naked goddesses on the mountain and was changed into an ibex as punishment. In the medieval period, Mont Aiguille was traditionally called &quot;Mount Inaccessible&quot;, and typically depicted as an &quot;inverted pyramid&quot; or &quot;mushroom&quot;.
Since at least the thirteenth century, the mountain has been regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of Dauphiné. The mountain is most noted for its first ascent in 1492. Charles VIII ordered that the peak be climbed, so one of his servants, Antoine de Ville, made the ascent using a combination of ladders, ropes and other artificial aids. He was visited in the following days by many local members of the nobility and aristocracy. The team bivouacked on the summit for eight days, erecting small crosses and a stone shelter. The ascent is described by François Rabelais in his &quot;Quart Livre&quot;. This was the first recorded climb of any technical difficulty, and has been said to mark the beginning of mountaineering. 

The mountain was not climbed again until 1834, nearly 350 years later, when it was ascended barefoot by Jean Liotard, accompanied for one-quarter of the way by local explorers. Less than a month later, it was climbed by seven people at the same time, who reportedly danced and sang &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; on the summit.
In 1940, the top of the mountain collapsed, reducing the height to . Seventeen years later, on 27 August 1957, the stunt pilot Henri Giraud landed a Piper J-3 Cub on the summit, utilising an -long, -wide runway which had been built earlier that day using materials and men lifted to the summit by helicopters. In the following 18 years, he staged a further 51 landings on the summit before his final landing in 1975, many carrying paying passengers, and often made using skis. The mountain was designated in 1970 as part of the Vercors Regional Natural Park.

<doc id="653415" wikidata="Q5532499" url="?curid=653415" title="Generalized nondeterministic finite automaton">
<text>In the theory of computation, a generalized nondeterministic finite automaton (GNFA), also known as an expression automaton or a generalized nondeterministic finite state machine, is a variation of a 
nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) where each transition is labeled with any regular expression. The GNFA reads blocks of symbols from the input which constitute a string as defined by the regular expression on the transition. There are several differences between a standard finite state machine and a generalized nondeterministic finite state machine. A GNFA must have only one start state and one accept state, and these cannot be the same state, whereas an NFA or DFA both may have several accept states, and the start state can be an accept state. A GNFA must have only one transition between any two states, whereas a NFA or DFA both allow for numerous transitions between states. In a GNFA, a state has a single transition to every state in the machine, although often it is a convention to ignore the transitions that are labelled with the empty set when drawing generalized nondeterministic finite state machines.

==Formal definition==
A GNFA can be defined as a 5-tuple, (&quot;S&quot;, Σ, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;a&quot;), consisting of
* a finite set of states (&quot;S&quot;);
* a finite set called the alphabet (Σ);
* a transition function (&quot;T&quot; : (&quot;S&quot; formula_1 {&quot;a&quot;}) × (&quot;S&quot; formula_1 {&quot;s&quot;}) → &quot;R&quot;);
* a start state (&quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;);
* an accept state (&quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;);
where &quot;R&quot; is the collection of all regular expressions over the alphabet Σ.

The transition function takes as its argument a pair of two states and outputs a regular expression (the label of the transition). This differs from other finite state machines, which take as input a single state and an input from the alphabet (or the empty string in the case of nondeterministic finite state machines) and outputs the next state (or the set of possible states in the case of nondeterministic finite state machines). A DFA or NFA can easily be converted into a GNFA and then the GNFA can be easily converted into a regular expression by repeatedly collapsing parts of it to single edges until &quot;S&quot; = {&quot;s&quot;, &quot;a&quot;}. Similarly, GNFAs can be reduced to NFAs by changing regular expression operators into new edges until each edge is labelled with a regular expression matching a single string of length at most 1. NFAs, in turn, can be reduced to DFAs using the powerset construction. This shows that GNFAs recognize the same set of formal languages as DFAs and NFAs.

<text>Wilma Helen Hunley (September 6, 1920 – October 22, 2010) was a Canadian politician and the 12th Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, the first woman to serve in that post.

==Early life==
She was born in Acme, Alberta, to James Edgar Hunley and Esta May Hunley. She first worked as an operator, served overseas in the Canadian Women&#x27;s Army Corps during World War II and eventually owned and operated an International Harvester franchise and an insurance business.

==Political career==
Hunley served as a town councilor from 1960 to 1966 and then mayor of Rocky Mountain House, Alberta, from 1966 to 1971. Hunley was elected to the province&#x27;s legislative assembly as a Progressive Conservative. She was the province&#x27;s cabinet minister serving as Minister Without Portfolio from 1971 to 1973, Solicitor-General from 1973 to 1975 and then Minister of Social Services and Community Health from 1975 until 1979 when she retired from politics.

In June, 1980, Hunley was appointed chair of the Alberta Mental Health Advisory Council. She also served on the Alberta 75th Anniversary Commission.

Hunley became president of the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta in 1984 and, in 1985, was appointed by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé, on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, to the position of lieutenant-governor. She served in the position until 1991. In 1992, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

<text>A utility vehicle (UV) is a vehicle, generally motorized, that is designed to carry out a specific task with more efficacy than a passenger vehicle. It sometimes refers to a small truck with low sides.

== Types of utility vehicles ==
=== Military light utility vehicle ===

Military light utility vehicle, or simply light utility vehicle (LUV), is a term used for the lightest weight class military vehicle category. A Jeep-like four-wheel drive vehicle for military use by definition lighter than other military trucks and vehicles, inherently compact and usually with light or no armour, with short body overhangs for nimble all-terrain mobility, and frequently around 4-passenger capacity.

=== Armored utility vehicle ===
The military also uses armored utility vehicles.

=== Multi-utility vehicle ===
These are larger vehicles which can tackle a wide range of applications. They typically allow easy conversion between multiple combinations of passenger and luggage capacity.

=== Sport utility vehicle (SUV) ===

Traditionally, these are vehicles similar to a station wagon but built on a light-truck chassis and equipped with four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, amongst other off-road hardware. Their primary purpose is to display better off-road and towing capabilities with higher seating capacity.

=== Crossover utility vehicle ===

Station wagons based on a car chassis, but built to resemble sport utility vehicles. They have a limited off-road capability but sportier on-road behavior than SUVs. May also be referred to as a &quot;Sports Activity Vehicle&quot;, as is the case with BMW&#x27;s X-range of vehicles.

=== Light equipment ===

Vehicles like the Kawasaki MULE in which a flatbed is added to an all terrain vehicle. Generally used as a maintenance vehicle.
A jeep is a type of light off-road vehicle, originally used by the US military, with four-wheel drive for general utility work that required travelling over rough terrain.

=== Coupé utility or tray utility vehicle ===

Vehicles featuring a coupé passenger compartment with an attached cargo bed. All-steel-bodied, sedan-cabined utility vehicles, more commonly called &quot;utes&quot;, were popular in Australia.

=== Utility truck ===

Utility trucks or sport utility trucks (SUT), commonly known as pickup trucks in the United States, are similar to coupé utilities. The main difference is that they are either explicitly built for purpose or based upon sport utility vehicles rather than being produced by modifying existing passenger vehicles. They combine elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive.

=== Utility task vehicle ===

The &quot;Side-by-side (SxS)&quot;, a utility task vehicle (UTV), is a small four-wheel off-road vehicle. It has a side-by-side seating arrangement, and UTVs often have seat belts, roll-over protection and a storage box at the vehicle&#x27;s rear.

In 2017, the UTV category was added to the Rally Dakar.

<text>The Ripon Society is an American center-right Republican public policy organization and think tank based in Washington, D.C. It publishes &quot;The Ripon Forum&quot;, the U.S.&#x27;s longest running Republican thought and opinion journal, as well as &quot;The Ripon Advance,&quot; a daily news publication.

Founded in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Society&#x27;s name comes from the 1854 birthplace of the Republican Party—Ripon, Wisconsin. The Society&#x27;s goals include protecting national security, lowering taxes, and shrinking the size of the government.

The Ripon Society was the first major Republican organization to support passage of the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s. In 1967, it advanced the concept of a negative income tax. In the early 1970s, it called for the normalization of relations with China, and the abolition of the military draft.
==History==

===Founding===

====Emil Frankel and the Bow Group====
Emil Frankel was a Harvard law student in the early 1960s. He had studied in England on a Fulbright scholarship. While in England, he met members of a group called the Bow Group. The Bow Group founders had been &quot;dissatisfied with the Conservative Party&#x27;s image as &#x27;the Stupid Party&#x27;.&quot; The Bow Group impressed Frankel, particularly regarding the level of detail that its members applied to study public policy problems and the proactive way its members became experts on policy topics.

At the same time John S. Saloma III was a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Like Frankel, Saloma had studied in England on a Fulbright scholarship. Both Frankel and Saloma became editors at &quot;Advance&quot; magazine.

In December 1962, Frankel and Saloma &quot;circulated a confidential &#x27;Proposal for an American Bow Group&#x27;&quot;. Saloma and Frankel held a meeting on December 12, 1962, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at Harvard College. The meeting would become the first meeting of the group that eventually became known as the Ripon Society. The name is a reference to Ripon, Wisconsin, the informal birthplace of the Republican Party. (The town&#x27;s claim was disputed by Jackson, Michigan, where the first official meeting of the Party was held; but a Republican organization was unlikely to name itself &quot;The Jackson Society&quot;).

The society&#x27;s meetings took place monthly at locations around Harvard. Some sixty individuals attended at least one Ripon meeting during its first year, and about half became active members. Most were graduate or professionals students and young professors from Harvard, M.I.T., and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts. The members of the Ripon Society were primarily white, middle-class, and a majority of members were from the Midwest.

====A Call to History====
On November 22, 1963, a group of Ripon Society members were having lunch in a dining hall at Harvard University. During lunch, they were planning a trip to campaign for Nelson Rockefeller for president, who was at that time the Republican governor of New York. Near the end of their lunch meeting, the members got word that President John F. Kennedy had been shot.

Political historian and author Geoffrey Kabaservice writes, &quot;Although they (the Ripon Society members) were Republicans, JFK had been their political inspiration. When the news confirmed that Kennedy had been killed, they were caught between grief for their fallen hero and fear of Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded to the presidency&quot;.

Over the weeks following Kennedy&#x27;s death, the Ripon members wrote a manifesto, &quot;A Call to Excellence in Leadership: An Open Letter to the New Generation of Republicans.&quot; Newspapers around the U.S. published highlights of the manifesto. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; published it in full. The media attention given to the &quot;Call to Excellence&quot; thrust Ripon onto the national stage. The &quot;Washington Star&quot; was one newspaper that editorially hailed the Society as &quot;a new voice in the land ... a voice that ought to be heeded.&quot;

Another voice was President (and Republican) Dwight D. Eisenhower, who wrote &quot;my delight that an obviously intelligent group of people has taken the trouble to voice its consensus on this important subject, and also to express my basic agreement in the mainstream of its thinking.&quot;

====The Ripon Papers====

The Ripon Society wrote its first public statement in the weeks that followed Kennedy&#x27;s assassination and published the statement on January 6, 1964:

While we yet sorrow, so must we seize this moment before our thoughts slip away to be lost in the noise of &#x27;life as usual.&#x27; It is in this context that we have chosen to speak. We speak as a group of young Republicans to that generation which must bear the responsibility for guiding our party and our country over the coming decades. We speak for a point of view in the Republican Party that has too long been silent.

We believe that the future of our party lies not in extremism, but in moderation. The moderate course offers the Republican Party the best chance to build a durable majority position in American politics. This is the direction the party must take if it is to win the confidence of the &quot;new Americans&quot; who are not at home in the politics of another generation: the new middle classes of the suburbs of the North and West – who have left the Democratic cities but have not yet found a home in the Republican party; the young college graduates and professional men and women of our great university centers – more concerned with &quot;opportunity&quot; than &quot;security&quot;, the moderate of the new South – who represent the hope for peaceful racial adjustment and who are insulted by a racist appeal more fitting another generation. These and others like them hold the key to the future of our politics.

We believe that the Republican Party should accept the challenge to fight for the middle ground of American politics. The party that will not acknowledge this political fact of life and courageously enter the contest for power does not merit and cannot possibly win the majority support of the American people.

===John Saloma, founding president===

The first president of the society was John S. Saloma III, serving from 1963 until 1967. In 1962, Saloma founded the American Bow Group, a society of university intellectuals. In 1963, the American Bow Group became the Ripon Society.

Saloma attended MIT and the London School of Economics. He received his doctorate from Harvard University with his dissertation &quot;British Conservatism and the Welfare State&quot;.

In his career, Saloma&#x27;s work focused mainly on the American political party system. Participating in a project studying the U.S. Congress sponsored by the American Political Science Association and the Carnegie Foundation, he published &quot;Congress and the New Politics&quot; in 1969 which dealt with the workloads in the offices of members of Congress. This led to an interest in the congressional budget process and the possibilities of computer use in the daily job of a representative. He died on July 6, 1983, in San Francisco, California.

Other founding members include Tom Petri, a U.S. congressman, and Lee Huebner.

===1964 Presidential campaign===
A &quot;Slate&quot; article in 1998 attributed the Ripon&#x27;s founding, in part, to &quot;Republicans put off by the vulgarity of the Goldwater campaign ...&quot; In 1964, conservative activists within the Republican Party nominated Barry Goldwater for president. The Ripon Society argued against Goldwater, writing:We believe that the future of our party lies not in extremism, but in moderation. The moderate course offers the Republican Party the best chance to build a durable majority position in American politics. This is the direction the party must take if it is to win the confidence of the &#x27;new Americans&#x27; who are not at home in the politics of another generation: the new middle classes of the suburbs of the North and West – who have left the Democratic cities but have not yet found a home in the Republican party; the young college graduates and professional men and women of our great university centers – more concerned with &#x27;opportunity&#x27; than &#x27;security&#x27;; the moderates of the new South – who represent the hope for peaceful racial adjustment and who are insulted by a racist appeal more fitting another generation. These and others like them hold the key to the future of our politics.

==Journals and publications==

===Ripon Forum===
&quot;The Ripon Forum&quot;, a magazine that features articles from a variety of contributors, is published quarterly by the Ripon Society. It has been described as &quot;... the only national magazine expressing a progressive Republican view.&quot;

===Ripon Advance===
&quot;The Ripon Advance&quot; is a daily publication that provides news and information about public policy and highlights the work of state and federal elected officials.

==Summary of major historical events==
==Ripon Society and Federal Election Commission==

In 2004, the Ripon Society requested a legal advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Ripon wanted to pay for a TV campaign commercial in favor of the re-election of Congresswoman Sue Kelly (R-NY). Ripon&#x27;s argument in favor of being allowed to run the commercial was that the commercial would promote homeland security policies that the Ripon Society, and Congresswoman Kelly, supported.

The requested advisory opinion amounted to a request for an interpretation of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 as it applied to the specific details of the proposed campaign advertisement.

The FEC responded by saying that the law prohibited Ripon from paying for the ad if it was televised within Congresswoman Kelly&#x27;s congressional district. However, the FEC said that Ripon could pay for the ad if it were televised outside of her district and only if the Ripon Society did not coordinate with Republican Party officials.

In FEC Advisory Opinion 2004-33, the FEC said the Ripon Society could not legally pay for a political TV commercial for a congressional candidate if it was aired in the candidate&#x27;s district immediately before an election (30 days before a primary election or 60 days before a general election). At that time (2004), the law prohibited corporate funds from paying for &quot;electioneering communication&quot;, an umbrella term that includes campaign TV commercials.

==Republican of the Year Award==
In addition to George H. W. Bush, other Republican of the Year recipients have included former Senator Bob Dole and former Senator Howard Baker

==Programs==

===Lecture series===
The Ripon Society hosts a series of lectures known as their &quot;Policy &amp; Politics Dialogue Series&quot;, which in 2011 has consisted of over 40 idea-based forums. Speakers have included: Speaker of the House John Boehner, Representatives Kevin Brady and Greg Walden, Senators Rob Portman and John McCain, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. At a Ripon event in January 2013, shortly after President Obama&#x27;s second inaugural address, Boehner told the audience that President Obama was trying to &quot;annihilate the Republican Party.&quot;

===Breakfast series===
The Ripon Society hosts breakfast forums that feature members of Congress. For example, the breakfast forums have hosted the Republican Women&#x27;s Policy Committee, National Republican Senatorial Committee, and House Ways and Means Committee members.

===Rough Rider awards===
Between 1999 and 2004, the Society gave what was known as the Rough Rider Awards to recognize public officeholders who have &quot;&#x27;stood in the arena, and pushed for innovative policy solutions on a range of issues.&quot; Notable recipients included former Wisconsin Governor and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, future House Speaker John Boehner, and White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card.

==Bipartisan action==
This section summarizes some of the bipartisan legislation and actions led by Members of Congress who sit on Ripon&#x27;s congressional advisory board.

===Superbugs, nightmare bacteria and the FDA===
Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), a member of the Ripon congressional advisory board, along with Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) introduced a bill in January 2015 known as the PATH Act. The bill would change the drug approval process for antibiotic drugs that fight &quot;combat resistant bacteria&quot;. These types of bacteria, also known as &quot;superbugs&quot;, don&#x27;t respond to antibiotic medication. The Centers for Disease Control says that 23,000 people in the U.S. die each year from these types of bacteria.

==Congressional Advisory Board==

The advisory board also includes the following retired Members of Congress:

* Bill Archer (TX)
* Henry Bonilla (TX)
* Michael Castle (DE)
* Geoff Davis (KY)
* Mike Ferguson (NJ)
* David Hobson (OH)
* Nancy Johnson (CT)
* Sue Kelly (NY)
* Scott Klug (WI)
* Bob Livingston (LA)
* Jim McCrery (LA)

<text>Weasel Walter (born Christopher Todd Walter, May 18, 1972) is an American composer, improviser, multi-instrumentalist, producer, and founder of ugEXPLODE Records. Walter&#x27;s work has been informed by techniques and traditions of music including Avant-garde, experimental, no wave, free jazz, extreme metal, punk jazz, hardcore punk, noise, new music and 
free improvisation. He coined the term &quot;brutal prog&quot; to describe the aggressively dissonant strain of prog played by groups like his band the Flying Luttenbachers.

Known as an unrelenting and abrasive provocateur whose performances trend toward overblown antics and &quot;nihilistic glee&quot;, Walter has been described by guitarist Mary Halvorson as &quot;completely manic and extraordinarily sensitive&quot; and by &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; as &quot;a splinter lodged beneath the fingernail&quot;. Avant-garde artist Glenn Branca once called him &quot;one of the greatest rock composers who ever lived&quot;.

He has performed as leader and sideperson in a number of bands, including Cellular Chaos and Lydia Lunch Retrovirus. Walter has worked with Roscoe Mitchell, Marshall Allen, John Butcher, Tim Dahl, Peter Evans, Mary Halvorson, Henry Kaiser, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, Evan Parker, Elliott Sharp, Ken Vandermark, and William Winant, as well as in bands including XBXRX, Bobby Conn, Cock E.S.P., Curse of the Birthmark, Erase Errata, Harry Pussy, Lair of the Minotaur, The Chicago Sound and others. He has produced albums by AIDS Wolf, Arab on Radar, Glenn Branca, Burmese, Lydia Lunch, Coachwhips, and Total Shutdown.

==Career==

In 1990, Walter moved to Chicago to work with free jazz composer Hal Russell (born Harold Luttenbacher) at Columbia College. The following year, Russell joined Walter in co-founding the band the Flying Luttenbachers; saxophonist Chad Organ played in the early trio lineup. Russell left the band in the summer of 1992, and shortly after Ken Vandermark took his place for the recording of the band&#x27;s first 7&quot;.

Walter was highly involved in cultivating what he deemed the &quot;Chicago No Wave&quot; scene, meeting new musicians and collaborators through the Luttenbachers&#x27; art rock-continuum gigs and the experimental improvised music series he ran at Myopic Books. He graduated from Columbia College in 1995, with a final project, &quot;Un-nerve&quot;, performed by a nonet including Ken Vandermark, Gene Coleman, Jim Baker, Kevin Drumm, Jeb Bishop, and Gustavo Leone.

A prolific performing and recording artist, Walter was a founding member of projects including Miss High Heel (with Jim O&#x27;Rourke and Azita of The Scissor Girls), Lake of Dracula (with Marlon Magas and Heather M. of the Scissor Girls), To Live and Shave in L.A. 2, 7000 Dying Rats, and Hatewave.

Walter moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, where he reformed The Flying Luttenbachers with the addition of bassist Mike Green, guitarist Ed Rodriguez, and later Mick Barr. The Flying Luttenbachers officially disbanded in 2007.

In late 2009, Walter announced that he was moving to New York City to join Behold... The Arctopus as the band&#x27;s second drummer. He played on &quot;Horrorscension&quot;, released in 2012, and in two tours before leaving the band in 2013. Walter continued finding new collaborators and formed a number of groups in New York, among them Cellular Chaos, a band with Marc Edwards, Admiral Grey, and Ceci Moss.

In 2017, after a ten-year hiatus, the Flying Luttenbachers played several shows in France, with a new trio lineup of Walter, on drums, joined by bass guitarist Tim Dahl and guitarist Chris Welcome. In 2019, a quartet arrangement of the band released &quot;Shattered Dimension&quot;, with Walter and Dahl joined by saxophonist Matt Nelson and guitarist Brandon Seabrook. Over the next several years, the varying lineup also included bassist Evan Lipson, guitarist Henry Kaiser, guitarist Wendy Eisenberg, guitarist Katie Battistoni, guitarist Alex Ward, and drummer Sam Ospovat.
