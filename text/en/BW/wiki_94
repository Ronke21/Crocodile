<doc id="657682" wikidata="Q2083671" url="?curid=657682" title="List of characters in the Family Guy franchise">
<text>&quot;Family Guy&quot; is an American animated comedy multimedia franchise originally conceived and created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company, primarily based on the animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot; (1999–present), its spin-off series &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; (2009–2013), and the film &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot; (2005), based on his 1995–1997 thesis films &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; and &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;.

Set in the fictional towns of Quahog, Rhode Island, and Stoolbend, Virginia, the show exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags often lampooning American culture. The following is an abridged list of characters consisting of the starring families (Griffin; Brown/Tubbs) and supporting characters from all three. Characters are only listed once, normally under the first applicable subsection in the list; very minor characters are listed with a more regular character with whom they are associated.

==Appearances==
==The Griffin Family==
===Peter Griffin===

Peter Löwenbräu Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the patriarch of the Griffin household, a 46-year-old Irish-American blue-collar worker and the &quot;family guy&quot; of the show&#x27;s title. For most of the series, Peter is shown as an obese, unintelligent, lazy, outspoken, childish, and eccentric alcoholic.

===Lois Griffin===

Lois Patrice Griffin (née Pewterschmidt) (voiced by Alex Borstein) is the matriarch of the Griffin household, Peter&#x27;s wife, and the mother of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. She is 45-years-old, and is of German and Jewish descent.

===Meg Griffin===

Megan &quot;Meg&quot; Griffin (voiced by Lacey Chabert in seasons 1 &amp; 2, Mila Kunis from season 2 onwards) is the Griffins&#x27; 18-year-old daughter. She is a self-conscious, insecure, and sensitive teenager who is more often than not ridiculed and ignored by the people around her.

===Chris Griffin===

Christopher Cross &quot;Chris&quot; Griffin (voiced by Seth Green) is the Griffins&#x27; 15-year-old son. He is a friendly, laid-back and slow-witted teenage boy who is a younger version of Peter physically, but intellectually, he often shows more potential, as demonstrated from moments of coherence and articulation within his speech.

===Stewie Griffin===

Stewart Gilligan &quot;Stewie&quot; Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the Griffins&#x27; 1-year-old child, but often behaves in adult ways such as speaking in an exaggerated upper-class English accent.

===Brian Griffin===

Brian Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the family&#x27;s 10-year-old (70 in dog years) anthropomorphic talking white Labrador Retriever and the best friend of both Stewie and his father, Peter.

===Extended Griffin family members===
The characters listed below are the extended family of the Griffin family that come from either Peter&#x27;s side of the family, Lois&#x27;s side of the family, and the occasional members of Brian&#x27;s family:

* Francis Griffin (voiced by Charles Durning) is Peter&#x27;s grouchy, stubborn and abusive 82-year-old Irish surrogate father, Lois&#x27;s surrogate father-in-law and the surrogate paternal grandfather of Meg, Chris and Stewie. He was married to Peter&#x27;s biological mother Thelma Griffin. An obsessively devout Irish American Catholic, he hates Lois because she is not a Catholic, and often calls her a &quot;Protestant whore&quot;, disapproves of his stepson&#x27;s family&#x27;s lifestyle, and frequently attempts to force his religious views on them. In &quot;Peter&#x27;s Two Dads&quot;, Francis attends Meg&#x27;s 17th birthday party, and is crushed by a drunk Peter while attempting a unicycle trick to entertain the party guests as &quot;Pee-Pants the Inebriated Hobo Clown&quot;. The injuries prove fatal, and as Francis is dying in the hospital, his last words to Peter before his death are, &quot;Peter… you&#x27;re a fat, stinking drunk.&quot;
* Mickey McFinnigan (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is Peter&#x27;s biological father, Lois&#x27; father-in-law and the biological paternal grandfather of Meg, Chris and Stewie. He lives in Ireland and is regarded as the town drunk (a highly respected position) in his neighborhood. Peter travels to meet him after he learns that Francis, who had just died, was not his biological father. He looks just like Peter, albeit he also wears a green vest and has a red beard, and has a talking sheep named O&#x27;Brian, with similar mannerisms to Brian. Despite that, he refuses to believe Peter is his son, so Peter then challenges him to a drinking contest and wins, which convinces him he is Peter&#x27;s father.
* Thelma Griffin (voiced by Florence Stanley in the first appearance, Phyllis Diller in later appearances and Alex Borstein as a young woman in &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Dickens at Christmas&quot;) – Wife of Francis, mother of Peter, mother-in-law of Lois and paternal grandmother of Meg, Chris and Stewie. She is an 85-year-old Irish American Catholic. In &quot;Mom&#x27;s the Word&quot;, it is revealed that Thelma has died of a stroke.
* Aunt Helen (Ellen Albertini Dow) is Peter Griffin and Karen Griffin&#x27;s aunt and Thelma Griffin&#x27;s sister, the aunt-in-law of Lois Griffin and paternal great-aunt of Meg Griffin, Chris Griffin and Stewie Griffin.
* Chip Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is Peter&#x27;s vestigial twin brother, who appears in &quot;Vestigial Peter&quot;. After he is surgically separated from the side of Peter&#x27;s neck, Chip lives in the Griffin household for a short while before leaving, eventually landing a role on &quot;The Middle&quot;.
* Karen &quot;Heavy Flo&quot; Griffin (voiced by Kate McKinnon) is Peter&#x27;s older sister, who first appears in &quot;Peter&#x27;s Sister&quot;. She is the paternal aunt of Meg, Chris and Stewie and the sister-in-law of Lois. Karen is a professional wrestler. 
* Carter Pewterschmidt (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is Lois, Carol and Patrick&#x27;s father, Babs&#x27; husband, Peter&#x27;s father-in-law and the maternal grandfather of Meg, Chris and Stewie. He is a cruel, selfish, petty, and prejudiced WASP old money billionaire industrialist, shipping mogul, and owner of several major companies. Though he generally despises Peter and disapproves of his marriage to Lois, he has occasionally teamed up with him to achieve some common purpose.
* Barbara &quot;Babs&quot; Pewterschmidt ( Hebrewberg) (voiced by Alex Borstein) is Carter&#x27;s wife, the mother of Lois, Carol and Patrick, the maternal grandmother of Meg, Chris and Stewie and the mother-in-law of Peter. She is a Jewish American Holocaust survivor who concealed her identity to marry Carter.
* Carol Pewterschmidt-West (voiced by Carol Kane in the first appearance, Julie Hagerty in later appearances) is Lois and Patrick&#x27;s sister, Peter&#x27;s sister-in-law and the maternal aunt of Meg, Chris and Stewie. She has been married and divorced nine times. Due to all of her marriages and divorces, her full formal name is Carol Pewterschmidt-Johnson-Carrington-Stone-O&#x27;Craggity-Canseco-Shteinholtz-Washington-Proudfoot-Fong-West.
* Patrick Pewterschmidt (voiced by Robert Downey Jr. in the first appearance, Oliver Vaquer in the second appearance) is the 46-year-old older brother of Lois and Carol, the maternal uncle of Meg, Chris and Stewie and Peter&#x27;s brother-in-law. His mother and father kept him secret from Lois as he was committed to a mental institution as a result of trauma from witnessing his mother having an affair with Jackie Gleason. After Peter unintentionally causes him to snap, he begins murdering fat men by strangling them and becomes known as &quot;The Fat Guy Strangler&quot;. In the episode &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, Patrick helps the Griffins track down an assailant who is trying to strangle Chris to death.
* Jasper (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is Brian&#x27;s stereotypical flamboyantly homosexual 4-year-old cousin. Brian stays with him in Hollywood in &quot;Brian Does Hollywood&quot;. Jasper&#x27;s partner is a Filipino man named Ricardo, whom he marries in &quot;You May Now Kiss the... Uh... Guy Who Receives&quot;.
* Bertram (voiced by Wallace Shawn) is the infant son of a gym teacher and her partner through artificial insemination. Bertram&#x27;s biological father is Peter Griffin, and he holds a grudge against his half-brother Stewie. Bertram appears in &quot;Emission Impossible&quot;, &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot; and &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, the latter of which sees him traveling back in time to attempt to kill Stewie&#x27;s ancestor, Leonardo da Vinci; although he succeeds, Stewie kills him and manages to save his own existence, as well as the entire universe (as Stewie became responsible for the Big Bang in the events of the episode).
*&quot;Boston Stewie&quot; is the result of an egg donation Lois made in 1997. He had been abandoned by his birth mother. Stewie tracked him down in Boston and tried to bring him into the family, without success. Boston Stewie ends up being adopted by Mark Wahlberg&#x27;s sisters. His real name is never given.
* Dylan Flannigan (voiced by Seth Green) is Brian&#x27;s human son. He first appears in &quot;The Former Life of Brian&quot;. His mother Tracy was devastated when Brian left her. After Brian apologizes to Dylan for not being there for him, Brian turns his son&#x27;s life around, making him into a charming, polite young man. Dylan then decides to leave the Griffin house and change his mother like Brian changed him. In &quot;Brian&#x27;s a Bad Father&quot;, Dylan returns as the star of a Disney Channel show.
* Biscuit is Brian&#x27;s deceased mother who appears in a flashback of &quot;Road to Rhode Island&quot;. She was stuffed by her owners after her death. Brian would go on to give her a proper burial. Biscuit is also seen during a flashback in &quot;Chris Cross&quot;.
* Coco is Brian&#x27;s deceased father who has never appeared on screen, but has been mentioned several times by Brian. According to Brian, Coco was racist towards African-Americans, and died after being run over by a milk truck.

Throughout the series, mainly during the first seasons, Peter often mentions various ancestors of the Griffin family, which are shown in cutaway gags.

==The Brown/Tubbs family==
===Cleveland Brown===

Cleveland Orenthal Brown Sr. (voiced by Mike Henry from 1999 to 2021, Arif Zahir from 2021–present) is a portly 42-year-old African-American man who is very polite to everyone and has a unique laugh. He was one of Peter Griffin&#x27;s best friends in &quot;Family Guy&quot; and also owned and ran a deli. In the &quot;Pilot&quot; of &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, he moves to the town of Stoolbend, Virginia to show his son where he grew up, unintentionally meeting up with his old friend Donna, whom he was in love with despite her being unaware. Eventually re-sparking his relationship with her, they get married and he and his son move in with her and her two children. Cleveland is usually depicted as exceedingly gentle and patient, and it is only on rare occasions that he has been known to lose his temper and resort to violence. However, Cleveland gets visibly annoyed with racist behavior. He often acts as the voice of caution when other characters hatch harebrained schemes. Cleveland&#x27;s speech is slow and almost elongated in &quot;Family Guy&quot;, but in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; his voice has a wide variety. Various flashbacks give conflicting histories of his speech patterns. He is shown as a more sexual, obnoxious, unintelligent, selfish, and violent character in his new form than he was originally. After the show was not renewed for a fifth season, Cleveland would move back to Quahog (and &quot;Family Guy&quot;) in the twelfth season, now working as a mailman.

===Loretta Brown===
Loretta Marie Callender Brown (voiced by Alex Borstein) is Cleveland&#x27;s late ex-wife and the mother of Cleveland Brown Jr. in &quot;Family Guy&quot;. In early episodes, Loretta had a minimal quantity of lines, the bulk of which were &quot;Mm-hmm!&quot;. She treated Cleveland harshly, and eventually cheated on him with Glenn Quagmire, leading them to divorce. She had a liking for cricket and the television program &quot;Friends&quot;. In &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; episode &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, she dies in a freak accident back in Quahog when in her 40s because Peter accidentally swings a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; skeleton found by Brian from a mobile crane into her house, destroying it and causing her to fall from the second floor in her bathtub (in a similar manner to Cleveland in a running gag on &quot;Family Guy&quot;), only for her neck to snap. She was buried in Stoolbend, and left her fortune to Cleveland Jr. in her will.

===Donna Tubbs-Brown===
Donna Lou Retten Tubbs-Brown (née Tubbs) (voiced by Sanaa Lathan), is the second and current wife of Cleveland Brown and the stepmother of Cleveland Brown Jr.. She is 42 years old and works as the principal&#x27;s secretary at Stoolbend High School. She has two biological children from her previous marriage with Robert Unknown (His last name is literally &quot;Unknown&quot;, which is a joke later in the series), Roberta and Rallo, and she has kept her maiden name (seen in &quot;Pilot&quot;, Cleveland says, &quot;Back in high school, I would have given anything to spend the night at Donna Tubbs&#x27; house.&quot;). While one of the main characters of &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, as of &quot;He&#x27;s Bla-ack!&quot;, she has now taken on the former role of the late Loretta as a recurring character of &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

===Cleveland Brown Jr.===

Cleveland Orenthal Brown Jr., (also referred to as Cleveland Raj Rerun Dwayne Brown) better known simply as Junior, (voiced by Mike Henry in early appearances in &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and Kevin Michael Richardson in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; and later appearances in &quot;Family Guy&quot;), is the obese 14-year-old biological son of Cleveland Brown and his late ex-wife Loretta. He debuted in the second-season episode &quot;Love Thy Trophy&quot; on the animated TV show &quot;Family Guy&quot;. During his time in &quot;Family Guy&quot; before &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; he was shown to be skinny, hyperactive, and athletic. He was presumably taken into Loretta&#x27;s custody after she and Cleveland divorced in &quot;The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire&quot; and has since become severely obese. He suffers from mild seizure-like episodes which he refers to as &quot;brainstorms&quot; and takes medication to control them. It was revealed in the episode &quot;The Hurricane!&quot; that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t believe in God&quot;, although he claims he is not an atheist either, which he calls &quot;another religion&quot;. Junior is one of the main characters of &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; and returns to the &quot;Family Guy&quot; cast as of &quot;He&#x27;s Bla-ack!&quot; as a recurring minor character.

At 14 years old, Junior is the only child of Cleveland, the stepson of Donna Tubbs, and the stepbrother of Roberta and Rallo Tubbs. Upon his parents&#x27; divorce, Loretta gave custody of Cleveland Jr. to Cleveland and forced him to move. Cleveland and Junior left for California. However, en route, they decided to live in Stoolbend, Virginia, instead, where Cleveland married Donna Tubbs, and Rallo and Roberta became his stepsiblings. Junior&#x27;s most prominent character traits are his laziness, obesity, and low social intelligence (although there are occasional references to him being academically bright).

====Role in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;====
Cleveland Jr. is a frequent target of weight-related jokes from a variety of characters in the series, in particular his stepbrother Rallo. When Rallo met Cleveland Jr. and his father, he would often call them &quot;fat&quot;. In the second episode, Cleveland Jr. served as a door in the bathroom so that he could earn his classmates&#x27; respect, which angered Cleveland. He also exhibits a nervous and overly sensitive nature.

While Junior is not as active as he was in &quot;Family Guy&quot;, he has other hobbies and interests; he enjoys science, playing the tuba in the Stoolbend High School band, and is the leader of a troop of Freedom Scouts, Stoolbend&#x27;s version of the Boy Scouts.

Cleveland Brown Jr. is married to Cecilia, as shown in &quot;Y Tu Junior También&quot;, to prevent her deportation.

====Character====
=====Creation=====
Cleveland Jr. debuted in the season 2 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Love Thy Trophy&quot;, but only made minor appearances thereafter. He was presumably taken into Loretta&#x27;s custody after she cheated on Cleveland in &quot;The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire&quot; and had since undergone a major character reinvention upon becoming a leading character in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;. After Cleveland and Loretta&#x27;s divorce is finalized in the pilot episode of &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, a now-overweight Junior is placed in Cleveland&#x27;s custody, and they move out of Quahog, Rhode Island to Stoolbend, Virginia where Cleveland rekindles a relationship with, and subsequently marries, his high school sweetheart, Donna Tubbs.

=====Design=====
In &quot;Family Guy,&quot; Cleveland Jr. was a hyperactive child of average size, but in &quot;The Cleveland Show,&quot; he had aged, gained weight, appeared potentially smarter, and wore glasses. In &quot;Family Guy&quot;, he wore a pink/light purple T-shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers, but in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, he wears a red T-shirt, blue shorts, sneakers and glasses. He is also notably shorter, as &quot;Family Guy&quot; shows him to be of average height for his age, while in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, he appears to be no more than 5 ft. at the age of 14.

Cleveland Jr. was a minor character who had a short time with Peter Griffin in the episode, &quot;Fore Father&quot;, where he showed a talent for playing golf. After that episode, he made short appearances later in the show, with his last on &quot;Family Guy&quot;, until 2010 at his father&#x27;s supposed funeral, along with Loretta.

=====Voice=====
Junior&#x27;s voice is provided by Kevin Michael Richardson, who voiced other characters on &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, including Lester Krinklesac, Julius, and P-Hound. Prior to &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, Junior&#x27;s voice was initially provided by Mike Henry in early &quot;Family Guy&quot; episodes.

Richardson stated that he describes voicing Cleveland Jr. as &quot;a character he did on &quot;ER&quot; named Patrick, who was mentally impaired and wore a football helmet.&quot; Before the show aired in 2009, the show&#x27;s panel appeared at the 2009 Comic Con International, and held a discussion about the show. When describing Junior&#x27;s change in physical appearance and age, Mike Henry said &quot;Cleveland Jr. really didn&#x27;t have much to him and so he didn&#x27;t appear for a while and so we sort of aged him up and made room for Rallo to be the younger one for a while.&quot; The show&#x27;s creators later gave an explanation of Junior&#x27;s altered look in &quot;A Rodent Like This&quot;.

===Roberta Tubbs===
Roberta Coretta Tubbs (sometimes Roberta Benigni Tubbs) (voiced by Nia Long and later Reagan Gomez-Preston) is the 15-year-old biological daughter of Donna and her ex-husband, Robert, Rallo&#x27;s sister, Cleveland&#x27;s stepdaughter and Cleveland Jr.&#x27;s stepsister. She looks up to Tyra Banks, hoping to one day become her co-hostess. A relatively popular girl in school, Roberta is often seen socializing with her friends, both in person, and using phones/social networking websites. She has been dating a less-than-respectable boy named Gabriel &quot;Federline Jones&quot; Friedman. Donna does not approve of Federline, though Cleveland has since managed to bully him into submission. As with many popular students, Roberta often acts as a bully and a self-centered character, even towards her own family members. She is also revealed to be a genius in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; Season 3 episode &quot;B.M.O.C.&quot;, when she went on a college tour to Cleveland&#x27;s alma mater, State.

Neither Roberta nor her brother Rallo are initially pleased with the arrival of Cleveland and Cleveland Brown Jr., though both appear to accept their mother marrying Cleveland without much issue. In fact, Roberta and Cleveland seem to fall into a rather stereotypical stepfather/stepdaughter relationship, with Roberta being embarrassed by her stepfather&#x27;s behavior when he attends social functions at her school. Eventually she accepts Cleveland as her father. While one of the main characters of &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, as of &quot;He&#x27;s Bla-ack!&quot;, she is now occasionally referred to and less frequently seen on &quot;Family Guy&quot;. She&#x27;s also the only member of the Tubbs family that has yet to speak in &quot;Family Guy&quot; (the video game &quot;Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff&quot; is not considered a speaking role).

===Rallo Tubbs===
Montclair &quot;Rallo&quot; Tubbs (voiced by Mike Henry) is the 5-year-old biological son of Donna and her ex-husband, Robert, Roberta&#x27;s brother, Cleveland&#x27;s stepson and Cleveland Jr.&#x27;s stepbrother. Despite his age, and the fact his father has been mostly absent most of his life, Rallo acts much like Robert, behaving at times very articulate, yet hormonally charged. He seems to get along fairly well with his mother, Donna and has a normal love/hate relationship with Roberta, who at times seems to neglect him, yet at other times speaks to him as an intellectual equal.

In &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; Season 3 episode &quot;American Prankster&quot;, Cleveland asks Donna why his name is Rallo. Donna replies to that question by stating it was from &quot;that guy from &quot;Sanford and Son.&quot;&quot; (referring to Rollo Lawson). One of the main characters of &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, as of &quot;He&#x27;s Bla-ack!&quot;, he is now an infrequently-appearing cast member of &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

===Extended Brown family members===
* Evelyn &quot;Cookie&quot; Brown (voiced by Frances Callier) is Cleveland&#x27;s mother, Donna&#x27;s mother-in-law, Roberta and Rallo&#x27;s step grandmother and Cleveland Brown Jr.&#x27;s paternal grandmother. Her first appearance was in the episode &quot;A Brown Thanksgiving&quot;. She deeply cares about her son and is prone to babying him, but also often stands by her husband. She is hypercritical of her new daughter-in-law Donna, having never forgiven her for spurning Cleveland in favor of Robert in high school, although Cleveland is quite oblivious to their rough relationship. In &quot;Baby Stewie&quot;, Cookie is stated to have died of a heart attack.
* LeVar &quot;Freight Train&quot; Brown (voiced by Craig Robinson) is Cleveland&#x27;s 63-year-old father, Cookie&#x27;s husband, Donna&#x27;s father-in-law, Roberta and Rallo&#x27;s step grandfather and Cleveland Brown Jr.&#x27;s paternal grandfather whose first appearance is in the episode &quot;A Brown Thanksgiving&quot;. He tends to take his wife for granted and is often verbally and physically abusive to Cleveland; the latter is revealed to be because of the latter&#x27;s ineptitude at a family game show when he was a kid, costing the Browns a victory.
* Broderick Brown is Cleveland&#x27;s brother and Cleveland Brown Jr.&#x27;s uncle who is a doctor who first appears in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;He&#x27;s Too Sexy for His Fat&quot;. In &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; he appears in the episode &quot;Our Gang&quot;, where it is revealed that he left his career as a plastic surgeon in Quahog to enlist in the navy, and he rescues Cleveland and Cleveland Jr. from a drug gang by trading Afghani heroin to the gang for their freedom.
* Robert (voiced by Corey Holcomb) is Donna&#x27;s 42-year-old ex-husband and the biological father of Roberta and Rallo. At the start of the show, he had grown negligent of the statuses of his children, not even knowing their names or ages, which convinced Donna to accept Cleveland as her true love.
* Kevin &quot;Auntie Momma&quot; Tubbs (voiced by Kym Whitley as a female and Kevin Michael Richardson as a male) is Donna&#x27;s caring, lovable, eccentric aunt who is in her 60s. She is a large, fat woman whose appearance and mannerisms are a parody of Tyler Perry&#x27;s character Madea. Auntie Momma was originally Donna&#x27;s Uncle Kevin and when Donna was younger, her parents were never around. So Uncle Kevin creates the character of Auntie Momma in order to provide Donna with a strong female influence in her life. 
* Dorothy &quot;Dee Dee&quot; Tubbs (voiced by Phylicia Rashād) is Donna Tubbs&#x27; long-lost mother, Cleveland&#x27;s mother-in-law, Cleveland Brown Jr.&#x27;s step grandmother and Roberta and Rallo&#x27;s grandmother. In the Season Three episode &quot;Mama Drama&quot;, they are reunited once again, and she becomes a recurring character for the remainder of the series. In the last episode of Season 4, Dee Dee begins a relationship with Robert (her daughter&#x27;s ex-husband), and they adopt a 5-year-old Chinese boy named Quang Quang. In the Season 14 episode Candy, Quahog, Marshmallow!, it is revealed Dee Dee committed suicide.
* Quang Quang (later Hong-Kong-Phooey) is the 5-year-old adopted Chinese boy of Dee Dee and Robert. This would make him Donna&#x27;s adopted brother, Cleveland&#x27;s adopted brother-in-law, Cleveland Brown Jr.&#x27;s adopted step-uncle, and both the adopted brother and uncle of Roberta and Rallo, who Donna refers to as their &quot;bruncle&quot;. Near the end of the episode, Quang Quang was christened with the new name Hong-Kong-Phooey by Reverend Jenkins.

==Neighbors and their relatives==
===Spooner Street===
* Doug (voiced by Chris Parnell) is a smug, condescending and insufferable toddler who lives in the Griffins&#x27; neighborhood and attends daycare with Stewie, with whom he shares a rivalry. He was first introduced in &quot;Island Adventure&quot;, and in most of his appearances, he usually shows up for the sole purpose of insulting Stewie. In &quot;LASIK Instinct&quot;, Doug is hit by Lois&#x27; car due to her waning vision, and the men of the Griffin household are tasked with looking after him in his father&#x27;s absence. Doug eventually reveals that he was faking the list of demands, as his parents are neglectful to both him and each other, and he just wanted to have fun. Stewie agrees to be friends with him privately, so long as they agree to remain rivals in public. During a heart-to-heart in &quot;80&#x27;s Guy&quot;, Doug reveals that he mainly antagonizes Stewie because he&#x27;s intimidated by his brilliance and envious of his hair. He later dies offscreen in a commuter plane crash in &quot;The Candidate&quot;.
* John Herbert (voiced by Mike Henry) is an elderly pederast who is often referred to solely by his last name. He resides just down the street from the Griffin family and distributes Popsicle ice pops to small children in his basement. He has a particular interest in Chris; in the episode &quot;Play It Again, Brian&quot;, Chris finally realizes this and asks Herbert, &quot;Are you a pedophile?&quot;, to no onscreen answer. Also, in &quot;Spies Reminiscent of Us&quot;, Stewie refers to a &quot;pedophile who lives down the street&quot; about which nobody is taking any action &quot;because he&#x27;s so funny&quot;, clearly talking about Herbert. He has a dog named Jesse, who is also very old and is unable to use his hind legs. He has a high-pitched, very soft effeminate voice and pronounces sibilant consonants with a high-pitched whistle. Herbert is often seen wearing a light blue robe and slippers, walks with a walker and frequently makes inappropriate, sexually tinged comments to teenage boys (in &quot;Road to the North Pole&quot;, Herbert wants a little drummer boy for Christmas, while staring at a poster of Nick Jonas). It is revealed later on that he is the eldest member of the Skull and Bones secret society. He was also a corporal in the United States Army and a POW during World War II. Herbert plays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; episodes. In &quot;And Then There Were Fewer&quot;, he drove an ice cream truck which in past episodes he has used to lure little boys. In &quot;Internal Affairs&quot;, Herbert&#x27;s ice cream truck is hijacked and destroyed during one of Peter and the Giant Chicken&#x27;s fighting rampages. In an interview, Henry stated that he based Herbert&#x27;s voice on an old man he used to meet at a grocery store. Before the character was used for the show, Mike would use the Herbert voice to motivate stalled writers at meetings. He also appeared in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; episode &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pancake, Cleveland Brown&quot; as Cleveland Jr.&#x27;s first house when he was trick or treating. In &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day in Quahog&quot;, it is revealed that Herbert&#x27;s first name is John and that he has a grandniece named Sandy.

====Quagmire family====
* Glenn Quagmire (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the Griffins&#x27; sex-addicted, next-door neighbor and one of Peter&#x27;s best friends. He is an airline pilot for Spirit Airlines (as revealed at the end of &quot;Passenger Fatty-Seven&quot;) and a former member of the US Navy, but is best known for his extreme sexuality and saying &quot;Giggity&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot; or yelling &quot;Oh!&quot; after innuendos.
* Crystal Quagmire (voiced by Alex Borstein in &quot;Fore, Father&quot; and Allison Janney in &quot;Quagmire&#x27;s Mom&quot;) is the mother of Glenn, Gary and Brenda Quagmire, the grandmother of Anna Lee and Courtney, and the ex-wife of Dan. Her first appearance was in &quot;Fore Father&quot; where she is seen in a flashback breastfeeding Glenn. Crystal was once very promiscuous and neglectful of her son, but it is revealed that prior to the events of the episode &quot;Quagmire&#x27;s Mom&quot;, she has become a born-again Christian.
* Ida Davis (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) – Born Daniel Quagmire, is the transgender parent of Glenn, Gary and Brenda Quagmire, the grandparent of Anna Lee and Courtney, and the ex-spouse of Crystal Quagmire, first appearing in the episode &quot;Quagmire&#x27;s Dad&quot; where she undergoes a sex change operation. Like her son, Ida is a military veteran, and was a war hero in the Vietnam War. She also has an on-again off-again relationship with Brian.

Peter and friends set up Bud to visit his son in Quahog for Father&#x27;s Day, only to learn from Joe that his father frequently makes fun of handicapped people and he doesn&#x27;t know his own son is now a paraplegic, so Peter and Joe pretend to be each other in front of Bud in hopes that he won&#x27;t find out the truth.

==Co-workers==
The following characters have worked with Peter and Cleveland at different jobs:

===Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory===
* Mr. Jonathan Weed (voiced by Butch Hartman in the pilot pitch, Carlos Alazraqui in the TV series) is the owner of the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory, where Peter originally worked under his supervision. He spoke with a strong Spanish accent and was described as an &quot;effeminate weirdo&quot; by his employees. He disapproved of nearly all of Peter&#x27;s actions, mainly because most of them were detrimental to the company, and fired or came close to firing Peter on multiple occasions. In &quot;Mr. Saturday Knight&quot;, he is invited to the Griffins&#x27; house for dinner. He promotes Peter to head of toy development and minutes later chokes to death on a dinner roll after it was Heimlich maneuvered out of Brian&#x27;s throat and into Mr. Weed&#x27;s throat; the half-eaten dinner roll was actually taken into police custody. His video will describes how the factory will be replaced by a children&#x27;s hospital starting &quot;now&quot;, at which point the demolition machinery promptly starts tearing through the factory, endangering everyone present. His great-grandfather&#x27;s surname was &quot;Bermudagrass&quot; but was changed to Weed at Ellis Island. In the episode &quot;Lois Kills Stewie&quot;, Stewie tells Lois, before attempting to shoot her, &quot;Say hello to Cleveland for me, Oh, and Mr. Weed&quot;.

===Peter&#x27;s ship===

All of their dialogue is subtitled and not understood by the other characters. In &quot;From Method to Madness&quot;, they lament leaving Portugal for various low-paying jobs in Quahog such as caterers, fishermen, janitors, and babysitters. Peter treats them poorly while they worked for him as fishermen aboard his ship. In return, they urinate in his refreshments when the opportunity arises as seen in &quot;The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire&quot;. In this episode, Pasquale saves Joe&#x27;s life after he nearly drowns by using CPR. This prompts Lois to demand that Peter take CPR classes in order to learn what to do should the situation happen again.

===Pawtucket Brewery===
* Pawtucket Pat (voiced by Michael McKean) is the original Willy Wonka-like owner and mascot of the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery. So far, he has only appeared in the season 2 episode &quot;Wasted Talent&quot; and was mentioned in the season 4 episode &quot;Jungle Love&quot; when Peter started working at his brewery stating that Pat sold his brewery. A public statue of his ancestor - also called Pawtucket Pat - in the eponymous episode &quot;Pawtucket Pat&quot; becomes the center of controversy when it is revealed that he stole the recipe for Pawtucket Patriot Ale from the Narragansett tribe. After a publicized debate on whether or not the statue should be torn down, a group of Narragansett descendants intervene and their leader gives his say, stating that the pressing issue is not the injustices that Native Americans have faced in the past, but how society can help Native Americans today. Following this, the statue is relocated to the Quahog Museum.
* Opie (voiced by Mark Hentemann) is a seemingly mentally-disabled and gibberish-speaking co-worker of Peter at the Pawtucket Brewery and ward of the state. He has won &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; at least twenty times and has been promoted ahead of Peter. He appears to have mental retardation and never really does anything about it. He sometimes tells Peter to stick his finger in his mouth, only to bite it. He wears two different shoes on each foot. He once went for a haircut that went horribly awry. No-one other than Angela seems to understand what he is saying. However, Peter has been shown to understand him in some instances such as when he gets fired. In &quot;Whistle While Your Wife Works&quot;, Opie was forced to watch Peter and Lois have sex in his office at the brewery. In &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, he played a Tusken Raider. In &quot;New Kidney in Town&quot;, Peter sends him a shoutout on The Price is Right. In &quot;It&#x27;s a Trap!&quot;, he plays a small amphibious alien that swallows the door droid, voiced by Consuela, from Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s (Joe Swanson) palace. In &quot;The Blind Side&quot;, Opie is fired from his position for masturbating on the job (Peter comments that &quot;the underside of [his] desk looks like Carlsbad Caverns&quot;) and is replaced by a deaf woman named Stella. However, he has since been rehired as he has been seen employed at the brewery in later episodes such as &quot;The Birthday Bootlegger&quot;. He makes a cameo crowd appearance when Peter proposes reinstating the city government in &quot;Tea Peter&quot;. Opie can also be seen as Stewie rides through town under Brian&#x27;s car in &quot;Family Guy Viewer Mail 2&quot;. In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, Opie attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale. In &quot;Underage Peter&quot;, it is revealed that Opie is not disabled, but rather he spoke gibberish due to being constantly under the influence of alcohol.
* Angela (voiced by Carrie Fisher) was the former overseer of the Pawtucket Brewery&#x27;s shipping department, and the supervisor of Peter, Opie, and later Stella. She likes Opie far better than Peter, and treats Peter very coldly, repeatedly rewarding Opie as employee of the month. However, Angela fires Opie in &quot;The Blind Side&quot;. Peter tried to befriend her based on her love of animals, but ended up horrifying her by staging a bloody cockfight in her house. In &quot;Peter-assment&quot;, Angela sexually assaults Peter after he comes to work without wearing his glasses (which were broken at the time). After Peter refused to have sex with her and cheat on Lois, she tried to gas herself in her car. After Peter rescued her, it was revealed that she has not dated anyone in ten years. Feeling sorry for her, Peter disguised himself as a stereotypical 1920s New York billionaire and had sex with her. Angela knew it was really Peter, but what she did not know was that Peter, as a means of remaining faithful to Lois, hid Mort Goldman (who did it for $2) in his pants so it was Mort who actually had sex with her, not Peter. In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, Angela attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale. Following Carrie Fisher&#x27;s unexpected death on December 27, 2016, Seth MacFarlane revealed that Angela would appear on at least two more episodes that Fisher had already done voiceover work on in season 15, but would not comment on the character&#x27;s future except by saying that &quot;Family Guy will miss [Fisher] immensely.&quot; Her final appearance was during the sixteenth-season episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Be A Dickens At Christmas&quot;, aired on December 10, 2017. The episode &quot;Pawtucket Pete&quot; states that Angela had died after going swimming less than 20 minutes after she had eaten, presumably by way of getting a stomach cramp and drowning, as claimed in Peter&#x27;s eulogy for her. (Peter mentions to the audience, &quot;That&#x27;s a real thing, kids – listen to your mothers.&quot;)
* Bert and Sheila (voiced by Bryan Cranston and Niecy Nash) are an interracial married couple who become the new managers of the Pawtucket Brewery Shipping Department in &quot;Pawtucket Pete&quot; following the death of Angela. They were hired to replace Angela because Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot; was the favorite song of one of the Pawtucket Brewery&#x27;s shareholders. The characters were dropped before season 20 for unknown reasons and they were succeeded by Preston Lloyd.
* Fouad (voiced by Mike Henry) is one of Peter Griffin&#x27;s co-workers at the Pawtucket Brewery. He is a recent immigrant to the United States, apparently of Arab ethnicity. In all his appearances, he has demonstrated that he is extremely earnest in his attempts to learn a Western sense of humor and understand its subtleties, such as the nature of a sarcastic or ironic comment. He laughs in a loud manner at sarcastic or ironic statements before explaining why the joke was funny (for example, &quot;Ahh! Is funny because...&quot;). Peter does not seem to have a strong relationship with Fouad, likely due to his comparatively short time employed at the Pawtucket Brewery, however Peter gets along much better with Fouad than he does with Opie or Angela. Fouad first appears in &quot;Chick Cancer&quot;, being introduced by Peter as that foreign guy at work who helped him understand sarcasm. In &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, Fouad plays Lieutenant Shann Childsen on the Death Star prison deck, who laughs when Chewbacca (played by Brian) asks for a cell by the pool, stating that it is funny because prisons do not have luxury areas such as swimming pools. In &quot;Padre de Familia&quot;, Peter suspects that Fouad may be an illegal immigrant and is angered because of it. Fouad&#x27;s voice is also heard off-camera in a DVD exclusive scene in &quot;Three Kings&quot;. In &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; segment, Captain Byron Hadley (played by Seamus) yells for lights out, calling the inmates &quot;ladies&quot;, and Fouad remarks that it is funny because they are men.
* Stella (voiced by Marlee Matlin) is an attractive deaf worker at the Pawtucket Brewery. She debuted in &quot;The Blind Side&quot; as Opie&#x27;s successor.
* Preston Lloyd (voiced by Peter Macon) is the no-nonsense overall manager of the Pawtucket Brewery who succeeds Bert and Sheila in season 20. Despite managing a brewery, he finds alcohol repulsive and does not drink. He speaks in a deep, monotone voice.

===Waterman Cable===

* Jane (voiced by Stacy Ferguson) is a worker at Waterman Cable.

In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, Principal Shepherd attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale where he was placed next to Principal Skinner. In &quot;The Peter Principal&quot;, Principal Shepherd had a bitter divorce and breakdown causing the board of education to put him on an indefinite paid leave. As Vice-Principal Brenda McGuire was found dead in her car, the board of education asks for someone to come forward to be the interim principal until a permanent replacement for Principal Shepherd can be found. When Lois anonymously tipped off the board of education about how Peter was helping Meg and her friends on their revenge on the mean students, the board of education intervenes causing them to fire him and reinstate Principal Shepherd after he recovered from his divorce following his sex trip to Thailand. In &quot;Crimes and Meg&#x27;s Demeanor&quot;, Principal Shepherd&#x27;s first name is revealed to John, and he lives in an apartment building across from the building that is managed by Lou Spinazola. After a confrontation with Stewie and Brian over what appeared to have been him killing his ex-wife Fiona, which ended with Brian falling out of the window, Principal Shepherd admitted to the police and the medic about him living off food taken from the school to make ends meet when the police find the bag that supposedly leaked blood.
* Mr. Berler (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is one of Meg&#x27;s teachers at James Woods Regional High School. In &quot;The Kiss Seen Around the World&quot;, he disagrees with Neil Goldman&#x27;s selection of James T. Kirk as the better Star Trek captain supporting Captain Jean-Luc Picard as the superior officer. In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, Mr. Berler made a cameo at the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale.
* Connie D&#x27;Amico (voiced by Fairuza Balk in &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to the Hop&quot; and Lisa Wilhoit in all subsequent appearances) is the head cheerleader and most popular girl at James Woods Regional High School. Connie is a beautiful yet narcissistic and mean-spirited girl who tends to look down on those who are either socially inept or unpopular and encourages the other popular students who she is friends with to bully them, with Meg being an object of favoritism to this abuse. She is most often seen with her closest friends: Gina, Scott, and Doug. While a bully to most students lacking popularity and confidence, Connie does have a softer side; in &quot;Stew-Roids&quot; – Connie begs Meg for help after she realizes what it is like to be shunned and ridiculed by her classmates. In the same episode, she fell in love with (and dated) Chris when she realized how nice and kind he can be. In &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to the Hop&quot;, she dances with Peter when he went undercover as &quot;Lando Griffin&quot; at the Winter Snowball dance. In &quot;Connie&#x27;s Celica&quot;, her harassment of Lois as the school&#x27;s new music teacher earns her expulsion. In revenge, she (unsuccessfully) attempts to fake her death in a car accident (by putting Peppa Pig in a blonde wig in the driver&#x27;s seat) and frame Lois for murdering her by dismantling the brakes. It&#x27;s implied that Connie was arrested as she hasn&#x27;t been seen since.
* Gina (voiced by Alex Borstein in earlier appearances and Camille Guaty in later appearances, Nina Dobrev in &quot;Trading Places&quot;) is a popular student and cheerleader at James Woods Regional High School who is Connie D&#x27;Amico&#x27;s best friend.

Her tongue is supposedly cut off during her and Meg&#x27;s trip to Paris when they are kidnapped in &quot;Leggo My Meg-O&quot;. In later episodes however, she converses normally. She has a crush on Lois, but tries to keep it under wraps from Meg.

===Stoolbend High School===

* Gabriel Friedman (voiced by Jamie Kennedy) – more commonly known as Federline Jones, is Roberta&#x27;s Jewish classmate and boyfriend. He is a reference to rapper Kevin Federline/&quot;K-Fed&quot;. 
* Oliver Wilkerson (voiced by Mike Henry) is a popular deaf jock and school bully at Stoolbend High School. He is the captain of the school football team and often teases and torments Cleveland Jr. He leads the popular kids at his school and his closest friends are apparently Derek, Laine, and Reggie, although they are often seen without him.
* Derek (voiced by Julius Sharpe) is one of Oliver&#x27;s friends at Stoolbend High School. He is also possibly his right-hand man and like Oliver, he wears a letterman&#x27;s jacket and is on the school softball team and possibly the football team as well. When he attempts to join the others in making fun of other students (notably Cleveland Jr.), he goes much too far by often making incredibly inappropriate comments (such as describing things as &quot;gay&quot;), much to Laine&#x27;s anger.
* Laine (voiced by Alec Sulkin) is one of Oliver&#x27;s friends at Stoolbend High School. He is apparently the most intelligent of Oliver&#x27;s main group of friends.
* Reggie (voiced by Clarence Livingston) is one of Oliver&#x27;s friends at Stoolbend High School. He is most likely the most humorous of Oliver&#x27;s gang. His catchphrase is &quot;Whoa!&quot; and he reveals early in the series to have testicular cancer.

Though he was not given a name until the episode &quot;No Chris Left Behind&quot;, he has appeared in several episodes without being named on-screen; however, he is referred to in commentary tracks prior to that episode as &quot;the Performance Artist&quot;. He even comments on it the first time his name is spoken in the series. He has several catchphrases, the most notable being &quot;Oh, no!&quot; He first appeared as the clerk of an &quot;exotic entertainment&quot; shop in the season 1 episode &quot;Chitty Chitty Death Bang&quot;, and was then seen sitting astride an obese donkey at the Renaissance fair when Peter fought the Black Knight. He has since been seen with a variety of jobs including a deacon, a therapist, a medium, a lawyer, a masseur and a barman. More recently, he was seen working at the bowling alley selling rental shoes as seen in &quot;The Splendid Source&quot;, refereeing the boxing match where Lois fought Deirdre Jackson in &quot;Baby, You Knock Me Out&quot;, and working at Quahog Laser Tag in &quot;Forget-Me-Not&quot;. He has also been seen training to be a police officer, teaching a CPR course, chairing the Quahog Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and entertaining children at the Quahog Library. He is a member of the school board committee of James Woods Regional High School. Although Bruce himself is generally limited to occasional appearances, his voice is lent to a number of anthropomorphic creatures including a large bee, the shark in a parody of &quot;Jaws&quot;, a Xenomorph from a parody of &quot;Aliens&quot;, a Tetris block, and a giant mutant rat. In &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, he played the role of Greedo. He makes an appearance as Admiral Piett on the Imperial Star Destroyer in the episode &quot;Something, Something, Something, Dark Side&quot;. Bruce is openly gay, although he initially does not want to admit it to his parents, Phil and Candy Straight, who insisted on him meeting a woman. His partner/fiancé is his roommate Jeffrey (in &quot;Road to the North Pole&quot;, Bruce states in the song &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot; that his Christmas wish is a wedding ring from Jeffrey). In the episode &quot;BFFs&quot; of &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, Peter says that Bruce was his therapist and referred to him as &quot;that gay guy who has, like, a thousand jobs&quot;. Another character voiced by Mike Henry who was heavily implied to be Jeffrey appeared in both the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episodes &quot;Friends of Peter G.&quot; and &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;, and &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; episode &quot;Die Semi-Hard&quot; before being confirmed to be Jeffrey in &quot;Underage Peter&quot;. He also appeared in a deleted scene of the episode &quot;Stewie is Enceinte&quot;, adopting Stewie&#x27;s human-dog hybrid puppies at an animals shelter with Bruce. Bruce is also noted for his tendency to give unsolicited advice about mundane subjects, often during critical events. This occurs most notably during his training as a 911 operator. When a victim calls to report a man in her home, he provides tips for being a good host to unexpected guests. In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, Bruce attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale where he was sitting next to Waylon Smithers. In &quot;Meg&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, Bruce briefly had a romantic relationship with Meg. However, they ended it on the wedding day and Bruce finally got engaged to Jeffrey, and they marry in the parking lot outside of the church, since the priest wouldn&#x27;t allow them to marry in the church.
* Carl (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) is the manager of the local gas station and convenience store called the &quot;Quahog Mini Mart&quot;. He speaks in a calm, monotone voice and shows almost no emotion regarding anything happening around him. Carl is a cinephile, having an obsession with films and attractive actresses. In &quot;Road to the North Pole&quot;, he wants a Blu-ray of &quot;The Wiz&quot; for Christmas. He goes out of his way to discuss exciting movies. He becomes friends with Chris, when Chris worked for him in &quot;Movin&#x27; Out (Brian&#x27;s Song)&quot;. Their friendship is based on their mutual interest in movies. He does not get along well with Meg, although he did once hire her to work in the store. In &quot;Friends of Peter G.&quot;, it is revealed that the reason that he knows so much about movies is because he is an alcoholic and he spent so much time in his house and watched every film he could get his hands on. In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; episodes, Carl plays Master Yoda.
* Consuela (voiced by Mike Henry) is a Hispanic maid who, in one cut-away gag, is shown as the head of the Maids&#x27; Union. She speaks broken English and usually says &quot;No, no, no...&quot;, whenever asked to do anything. She first appears in &quot;Believe It or Not, Joe&#x27;s Walking on Air&quot; demanding Lemon Pledge in a court case. She is seen answering the door as Superman&#x27;s maid at the Fortress of Solitude in &quot;Stewie Kills Lois&quot; telling Joe and the police officers that Superman is not home. She appears in a cutaway in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Three and a Half&quot; on the game show &quot;Are You Smarter Than a Hispanic Maid?&quot;. In &quot;Dog Gone&quot;, she goes to work for the Griffin family, but proves to be so annoying that they drug her with chloroform and leave her with Joe. She has a nephew named Mikey, who sells light-up yo-yos, and a son named Rodrigo, who is in prison. Another of her nephews was molested by James Woods before he committed suicide, as revealed in &quot;And Then There Were Fewer&quot; when she was working as Woods&#x27; maid. In &quot;Stewie Goes for a Drive&quot;, Stewie runs away from home and ends up in a bad neighborhood. Consuela finds and takes him to her home and puts him in her bathtub, which is also being used to make soup for a Quinceañera celebration being held at her house. Brian tracks Stewie to Consuela&#x27;s house but she refuses to let him go, claiming that Stewie is her son &quot;Ernesto&quot;. Consuela also appears as Darth Vader&#x27;s maid in &quot;Something, Something, Something, Dark Side&quot;, and as the controller of the security system at the palace of Jabba the Hutt in &quot;It&#x27;s a Trap!&quot;. She also appears as Donna&#x27;s housekeeper in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Die Semi-Hard&quot;. In &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day in Quahog&quot;, it is revealed that Consuela has a husband who is still living in Mexico, and to see him annually on Valentine&#x27;s Day, she crosses the border illegally &quot;into&quot; Mexico. In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, Consuela attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale where she was sitting next to Bumblebee Man due to their both being Hispanic. In &quot;Dearly Deported&quot;, it is revealed that Consuela has an attractive niece named Isabella who has two sons of her own.
* Death (voiced by Norm Macdonald in the first appearance and Adam Carolla in later appearances) is the Grim Reaper figure in the form of a skeleton in a black robe who seldom removes his hood. Underneath his hood is a human skull with spiders and snakes crawling in and out of the eye sockets, mouth, and ear cavities as seen in &quot;Death Lives&quot;. He is present in &quot;Mr. Saturday Knight&quot; when Mr. Weed dies after choking during dinner at the Griffins&#x27;. In &quot;I Take Thee Quagmire&quot;, it is revealed that anyone who touches his bones dies instantly (though in &quot;Death Is a Bitch&quot; it seems that this is contradicted, but while Stewie rubs his ankle to heal it faster, Death being out of commission, no one at all is able to die). In &quot;Wasted Talent&quot;, Death comes to a college campus where a party had taken place and everybody is dead with beer bottles around the room. After doing his deed, he drinks some beer bottles to try to find a silver scroll (for Pawtucket Pat&#x27;s contest). He ends up getting drunk and crashes his car. In &quot;Friends of Peter G.&quot;, Death shows Peter what his life would be like if he continues to drink as much as he does, and if he does not drink at all. Peter learns to control his drinking from this. Death later ends up in a car crash in &quot;Grumpy Old Man&quot;, leading him to be taken away by &quot;Super Death&quot; (a larger version of himself) who tells him he was going to be reincarnated as a Chinese child. He disappears only to reappear seconds later as he was reincarnated a Chinese baby girl. In &quot;3 Acts of God&quot;, Death takes Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe to speak to God.
* Elle Hitler (voiced by Alex Borstein) is Quahog&#x27;s local librarian, originally named Joanna. She first makes two minor appearances in &quot;Petergeist&quot; and &quot;Movin&#x27; Out (Brian&#x27;s Song)&quot;, before making her first major appearance many seasons later in the episode &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, where this show had her renamed Elle Hitler. She claims to be of no relation to infamous dictator Adolf Hitler; when the townspeople greet her with &quot;Hi, Elle Hitler&quot;, it is a homophone of &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;.
* Dr. Elmer Hartman (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the Griffins&#x27; incompetent doctor who works at Quahog&#x27;s hospital. Dr. Hartman is generally shown to be an unskilled doctor and his skills fluctuate from episode to episode. In one episode, he mentions his Yale Medical School degree, but then implies it is a product of his calligraphy skills. Occasionally, he seems to know exactly what he is doing and performs great medical feats, such as plastic surgery to restore Peter&#x27;s face, to other episodes where he does not even understand common medical terminology, or needs a chart to find body parts and lets Meg take care of patients while he is gone, as in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television, Peter&quot;. He temporarily loses his medical license in &quot;Stewie Loves Lois&quot; when Peter accuses him of rape (it turns out that Hartman had in fact merely performed a normal prostate exam, though Peter did not understand the procedure). He manages to regain his license after treating Peter&#x27;s urination problem. In &quot;Believe It or Not, Joe&#x27;s Walking on Air&quot;, Peter brought up the fact that Hartman sounds very similar to Carter Pewterschmidt when he speaks. As a response, Hartman tells Peter that Carter is one of his patients and that there are only so many voices in the world; some are bound to be similar and that he never noticed because they do not talk all that much despite the fact that Carter is in fact a patient of his. This was brought up to turn the scenario that MacFarlane voices both Hartman and Carter into a comical situation. His name comes from MacFarlane&#x27;s close friend and fellow animator Elmer &quot;Butch&quot; Hartman. In &quot;New Kidney in Town&quot;, Hartman gives Peter one of his kidneys because the Griffin family are his last paying customers. Also in the episode, Hartman reveals that while attempting to clone a chicken, he inadvertently created the Giant Chicken where Peter says he is going to want to discuss with Dr. Hartman later. In &quot;Secondhand Spoke&quot;, it is revealed that Hartman has a gay son. In &quot;Ratings Guy&quot;, it is revealed that Hartman is the worst doctor at Quahog&#x27;s hospital. In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, Dr. Hartman was among the Quahog citizens to attend the trial between Pawtucket Patriot Ale and Duff Beer in Springfield. He was shown to have been seated next to Dr. Nick Riviera (who was also an incompetent doctor). In &quot;Once Bitten&quot;, Dr. Hartman enlisted his dad to get him and Seamus into a movie theater. In &quot;Papa Has a Rollin&#x27; Son&quot;, it is revealed that Hartman has dyslexia. Hartman is the general doctor for the Griffin family since they usually go to him for emergencies and surgeries.
* Frank Sinatra Jr. (voiced by himself) is a singer, songwriter and conductor who meets Brian Griffin in &quot;Brian Sings and Swings&quot; following his near-death experience. Frank gives him some words of wisdom before taking the stage at the Quahog Cabana Club. Brian and Frank start to sing together, and eventually Stewie Griffin joins them, forming the &quot;New Rat Pack&quot;. In &quot;Tales of a Third Grade Nothing&quot;, Frank and Brian purchase the Quahog Cabana Club. When business fails to improve, the two look to Stewie to bring in more customers. Stewie turns the club into a trendy Hollywood style night club called pLace that ultimately fails when Andy Dick shows up to party. The episode &quot;Bookie of the Year&quot; was posthumously Frank Sinatra Jr.&#x27;s final role where he was shown helping Brian and Stewie with a restaurant plan. The episode is dedicated to him.
* God (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the father of Jesus Christ and the creator of life. He is a central part of the basic tenets in the religion of Christianity. Although the basic concept of God exists in other monotheistic and polytheistic religions, it is the Christian God that serves as the basis for the character in &quot;Family Guy&quot;. His appearance in the show is the stereotypical appearance of an Abrahamic god in the Western world; a bald-headed Caucasian man with long white hair, a huge white beard and a white robe. Contrary to the widespread belief of a benevolent and pure God, the &quot;God&quot; character in &quot;Family Guy&quot; has often been shown to have several human flaws, especially being shown as being socially irresponsible and sexually perverted. In the episode &quot;Fifteen Minutes of Shame&quot;, he aims a sniper rifle with red dot sight at Meg from the clouds after she says, &quot;Oh God, kill me now&quot;, but is interrupted by a phone call before he can complete the task. In the episode &quot;Blind Ambition&quot;, God flirts with a woman at the Drunken Clam, and lights her a cigarette with lightning before accidentally vaporizing her and setting the bar on fire, to which he exclaims, &quot;Jesus Christ!&quot; Jesus then arrives, and hastily leaves the area with God in a Cadillac Escalade before they can be caught up in the blaze. In &quot;Untitled Griffin Family History&quot;, God asks his roommate Chuggs for a lighter, using it to light a fart. On his second attempt, the lit fart sets in motion the Big Bang that creates the universe. In &quot;The Courtship of Stewie&#x27;s Father&quot;, Joseph quarrels with a teenage Jesus, before Jesus storms out of the room shouting, &quot;You&#x27;re not my real father!&quot;. He then goes on to give God a phone call asking if he can go back to live with him in Heaven, but is rejected. God then turns to a young woman named Janet lying in his bed, hoping to have sex with her. Janet hands him a condom to his disappointment, and asks her to reconsider, saying it is his birthday, but Janet refuses. In &quot;Partial Terms of Endearment&quot;, Peter thanks God thinking he is set to participate in a threesome with Lois and her friend Naomi, to which God replies &quot;Don&#x27;t mention it, Peter&quot;. A jingle is then heard singing, &quot;God! He knows what turns you on!&quot; after which God says, &quot;Have fun!&quot; In &quot;Into Fat Air&quot;, God and Jesus discuss on how to name a country in the Himalayas. God says that the mountains look like nipples, to which Jesus replies by saying that he cannot just call a country &quot;Nipples&quot;. In response, God suggests the name &quot;Nepal&quot; to Jesus&#x27; approval. In other episodes, God&#x27;s serious side has also been shown on occasion such as in &quot;If I&#x27;m Dyin&#x27;, I&#x27;m Lyin&#x27;&quot; where he curses Peter with six of the 10 plagues after he lied to the people of Quahog about being a healer and is then worshipped as a god.
* Horace (voiced by Johnny Brennan) is the proprietor and bartender of The Drunken Clam for 30 years. Has been shown to have been working there for at least as long as Peter and his friends have been regulars. Horace has also been shot a handful of times, but has recovered from each incident. In &quot;One If by Clam, Two If by Sea&quot;, Horace sold The Drunken Clam following a storm and moved to Florida. He later repurchased it after moving back to Quahog. In &quot;Blind Ambition&quot;, Horace&#x27;s life is saved by Peter (who was blind at the time) when The Drunken Clam was on fire. In &quot;Save the Clam&quot;, Horace is accidentally killed when a baseball hit by Jerome hits him during a baseball game between The Drunken Clam and Mort&#x27;s Pharmacy. His death causes the bank to close The Drunken Clam which was enough for Peter, Joe and Quagmire to protest this until Jerome buys The Drunken Clam to keep Horace&#x27;s legacy alive.
* Jake Tucker (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is Tom Tucker&#x27;s deformed son and Chris&#x27; former classmate. Jake&#x27;s many appearances show him with an &quot;upside-down face&quot;; a mouth near the top of his head and eyes near the bottom. In &quot;It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One&quot;, he gets a normal face, via toxic waste. Although typically depicted as a demanding and obnoxious brat, Jake craves his father&#x27;s attention, which he rarely gets. It is also revealed in &quot;Peter Griffin: Husband, Father...Brother?&quot; that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t have a bottom&quot;. Though Tom often neglects him, he often shows that he cares when Brian accused Jake of giving Chris alcohol. However, when Chris gets his own back on Jake by planting drugs in his locker an enraged Tom declares him a &quot;bad boy&quot; and loses faith in him. In &quot;Mother Tucker&quot;, Jake is noticeably neglected by Tom when Tom pays more attention to Peter. But Peter then realizes that Tom should pay more attention to Jake.
* James Woods (voiced by himself) is a 58-year-old actor whose fictional persona becomes a criminal sociopath. In &quot;Peter&#x27;s Got Woods&quot;, he is invited by Peter to help deal with the local high school being named for Woods, i.e. James Woods Regional High School. While Brian&#x27;s attentions are turned to his girlfriend, Peter becomes friends with Woods. This friendship ends when Woods becomes jealous of Brian. Peter and Brian manage to trap Woods inside a crate (using Reese&#x27;s Pieces as bait), and ship him off to be studied by &quot;top men&quot;. Woods returns in &quot;Back to the Woods&quot;, stealing Peter&#x27;s wallet and assuming his identity. Peter retaliates by assuming Woods&#x27; identity and ruining his reputation on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; by announcing a comedy film about the September 11th attacks, resulting in massive backlash from the public. When Woods shows up to fight Peter, he is again thwarted when Peter and Brian trap him inside a crate exactly as they had done before. In &quot;Something, Something, Something, Dark Side&quot;, Woods makes an appearance as General Maximilian Veers. In &quot;Brian Griffin&#x27;s House of Payne&quot;, the CBS producers hire Woods to star in Brian Griffin&#x27;s television show, Woods making multiple changes to Brian&#x27;s original script that prompt Brian to back out of the project. James Woods reappears in &quot;And Then There Were Fewer&quot; in which he becomes a born-again Christian due to his new relationship with a young news intern named Priscilla. Woods turns his life over to Jesus wishing to make amends for his sins. Woods is later killed as part of an elaborate murder plot orchestrated by Diane Simmons. In &quot;Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream&quot;, it is revealed that the paramedics who loaded Woods&#x27; body into the ambulance recognized him and had his body rushed to a special Hollywood hospital where a teenage girl&#x27;s life force was drained into Woods which successfully resurrected him. He is still a born-again Christian when he encounters Peter Griffin and Tom Tucker in Hollywood. In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, James Woods was present in Springfield at the trial between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale. During this time, he interacted with his Simpsons counterpart from &quot;Homer and Apu&quot;. The episode &quot;Inside Family Guy&quot; had James Woods hosting the behind-the-scenes theme of the episode.
* Jeffrey (voiced by Mike Henry) is Bruce&#x27;s boyfriend and was initially an offscreen character before making his first official appearance in &quot;Underage Peter&quot;. In &quot;Meg&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, he and Bruce finally get married.
* Jerome (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is a 42-year-old African-American man, who first appeared in &quot;Jerome is the New Black&quot; in which he won the audition as a temporary replacement for Cleveland. It is revealed he was involved with Lois Griffin in their younger days before she met Peter, which made Peter jealous enough to burn down Jerome&#x27;s house, so Lois invited him to come live with them. Peter believed that Jerome was trying to steal Lois from him and became jealous. He kicked Jerome out of his house, but later apologized to him and they remained friends. Jerome also tells Peter that he had some &quot;nasty-ass sex&quot; with Meg when he was staying with the Griffins although Peter told him that he does not care about that. He returns in &quot;Save the Clam&quot; playing for Mort Goldman&#x27;s softball team against Peter and his team from The Drunken Clam. He accidentally kills Horace by swinging the ball towards his face. Jerome appears at the funeral where he apologizes for accidentally killing Horace. When it came to the demolition of The Drunken Clam which Peter, Quagmire, and Joe were protesting, Jerome appears and uses his sports earnings from lacrosse (which also happens to be his brother&#x27;s name) to buy The Drunken Clam in order to keep Horace&#x27;s legacy alive. In &quot;Baby Got Black&quot;, it is revealed that Jerome has a daughter named Pam and at first disapproved of her relationship with Chris. In &quot;Follow the Money&quot;, Jerome reveals that he lost both his childhood sweetheart and their daughter shortly after their wedding. In &quot;Pawtucket Pete&quot;, it is revealed that Jerome&#x27;s voice is unaffected by helium as seen when Peter fired a harpoon gun at Brian Griffin&#x27;s parade balloon.
* Jesus Christ (voiced by Seth MacFarlane in early episodes, David Goodman in &quot;Stu and Stewie&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, Seth Green in &quot;The Courtship of Stewie&#x27;s Father&quot; and Alec Sulkin in later episodes) is the central figure of Christianity. Throughout the duration of the series, there has been a running gag that Jesus drives a Cadillac Escalade. This is first seen in the episode &quot;Blind Ambition&quot;, in which he uses it to pick up God from the Drunken Clam after He accidentally set the bar on fire. In &quot;North by North Quahog&quot;, he is seen in the car in a trailer for the action film &quot;The Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This&quot; starring Jim Caviezel as Jesus and Chris Tucker, and directed by Mel Gibson. Jesus Christ&#x27;s most prominent appearance on the show came in the episode &quot;I Dream of Jesus&quot;, where he worked in disguise at a vinyl record store called &quot;Dead Format Records&quot; before being recognized by Peter. After a public display of his powers, including walking on water, he becomes a huge celebrity in Quahog. While having dinner with the Griffins, Jesus proves to Brian that he actually is Jesus Christ by turning their dinners into ice cream sundaes, before immensely enlarging Lois&#x27; breasts at Peter&#x27;s request, to the absolute shock of Brian. As the episode progresses, Jesus lets fame get to his head more and more while becoming more distant from Peter and his family, and ultimately gets himself incarcerated for drug abuse. When Peter visits him in prison, Jesus apologizes for his actions and decides that he probably was not mature enough to return to the world. He then gives Peter another record of &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; as a gift after the first one he had was destroyed by Brian and Stewie. In &quot;Chitty Chitty Death Bang&quot;, he turned water into funk. In the episode &quot;Holy Crap&quot;, Francis repeatedly gives Jesus the employee of the week award, and is himself later seen in a golf course going for a fourth birdie. Upon missing his putt, he uses his power to move the ball into the hole. In the episode &quot;And the Wiener is...&quot;, Jesus and Moses use guns to defeat the Romans in a film by the National Gun Association. In the episode &quot;Deep Throats&quot;, Lois asks &quot;What if Jesus had given up?&quot;, after which Jesus is seen in a shabby-looking house sitting lazily in a chair, with several children running around him, and calls out to their mother asking why their ironing board is still out. In &quot;Stu and Stewie&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, the adult Stewie tells his infant self of a time when he went back in time on vacation to see Jesus, saying that his abilities may have been exaggerated a bit. A cutaway shows adult Stewie and other members of the public watching Jesus perform Art Metrano&#x27;s &quot;tricks&quot; while humming the song &quot;Fine and Dandy&quot;. In &quot;Boys Do Cry&quot;, Stewie imagines what it would be like meeting Jesus, and in a cutaway is then seen entering a room in Jesus&#x27; house to find him naked washing himself in a tub. Despite noticing Stewie, he carries on. In &quot;Jerome is the New Black&quot;, he has an African-American counterpart in &quot;Black Jesus&quot; who is portrayed as a cool laid back character and is seen wearing sunglasses. In &quot;Go, Stewie, Go&quot;, he is seen in a dodgeball game on the side of the jocks pelting numerous balls at the nerds. In &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, Stewie is seen at the Last Supper suggesting the idea of rebellion to Judas Iscariot, pointing out that Jesus ordered five margaritas while all Judas had was the salad. In other episodes, Jesus has also been portrayed as a voice of reason, such as in &quot;Family Goy&quot;, where he tells Peter about his Jewish identity after Peter and Lois quarreled over whether their family should be Christian or Jewish. However, in response to Peter&#x27;s question asking which religion his family should follow, Jesus says &quot;6 of 1, they&#x27;re all complete crap&quot;. In &quot;3 Acts of God&quot;, it is shown that Jesus is dating Carrie Underwood. In &quot;The 2000-Year-Old Virgin&quot;, Jesus has broken up with Carrie Underwood.
* Jillian Russell-Wilcox (voiced by Drew Barrymore) is Brian&#x27;s cute, bulimic, and dimwitted girlfriend who is portrayed as a stereotypical blonde, and is in her 20s. She is quite ignorant; for example, she does not understand that Adolf Hitler died decades ago. She has a close friendship with Peter, who treats her more like a daughter than he does Meg, due to their similar levels of intelligence. The remainder of the Griffin family look on her as a figure of mockery and symbol of Brian&#x27;s shallowness, although she has affection for them, involving them all in her wedding. She first appeared in &quot;Whistle While Your Wife Works&quot;. She is the only girlfriend that Brian has dated for more than one episode, and was a recurring character in season 5. He stays with her purely for sex, though after they split, he felt strong feelings of love for her. In &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot;, when Brian talks about Jillian&#x27;s bulimia, he goes on to compare her to Karen from The Carpenters, who succumbed to anorexia in 1983, claiming she &quot;overdid it&quot; but he thinks &quot;Jillian&#x27;s found a good balance&quot;. She breaks up with Brian in &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; when it is revealed that Brian did not want a committed relationship with her, and she briefly dated Mayor Adam West. She got married in the episode &quot;We Love You, Conrad&quot;. In &quot;And Then There Were Fewer&quot;, her husband Derek Wilcox was murdered by Diane Simmons, making Jillian a widow. She is shown dating again in &quot;Tiegs for Two&quot;, where Quagmire attempts to date her to make Brian jealous, but she and Cheryl Tiegs leave together when they realize how immature both men are acting. In &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day in Quahog&quot;, Jillian is among the ex-girlfriends of Brian that Stewie assembles.
* Jim Kaplan (voiced by Danny Smith) is a con man who tricks Peter into spending money on various useless things on many occasions. He was first introduced as Doug but has been referred to as Jim in later episodes. First appearing in &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Paulie&quot;, he sells a car to Peter that does not have an engine under the hood but rather a picture of one by claiming that the car belonged to James Bond. He later sells Peter volcano insurance in &quot;When You Wish Upon a Weinstein&quot; where Peter paid him with Lois&#x27; rainy day money (which she planned to use after Stewie broke Meg&#x27;s glasses). With help from the accountant Max Weinstein, Peter reclaimed the money. Jim later sells Peter a TiVo in &quot;Bango Was His Name Oh!&quot; In &quot;A Fish out of Water&quot;, he gives Peter a loan for Peter&#x27;s new fishing boat and Peter offers up his house as collateral which later gets taken over by the bank and sold to a fashionable, artsy, neo-hippie-ish new couple named Jim and Abby. In &quot;Hell Comes to Quahog&quot;, he sells Peter a tank for Meg at a car dealership for her first car and finally convinces him by saying &quot;Did I mention it&#x27;s a tank?&quot;
* Judge Dignified Q. Blackman (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is the African-American judge who presides over trials involving any of this show&#x27;s characters. His full name was revealed by the bailiff in &quot;Veteran Guy&quot; when Peter, Cleveland, and Joe were on trial for violating the Stolen Valor Act of 2013.
* Lou Spinazola (voiced by Ralph Garman) is the building manager of the seedy apartment building that Brian Griffin resides in from &quot;The D in Apartment 23&quot; to &quot;Crimes and Meg&#x27;s Demeanor&quot;. Lou&#x27;s one rule in his apartment building is to never kiss the mail carrier. In &quot;Married... with Cancer&quot;, Lou allows Brian and his terminal cancer-recovered wife Jess Schlotz to move in while having developed a sitcom catchphrase.
* Olivia Fuller (voiced by Rachael MacFarlane) is a child actress and local Quahog celebrity. She debuts in &quot;From Method to Madness&quot; when Stewie attends the same theatre school as her, and while they do perform together at first, they eventually become rivals. She moves away prior to the episode &quot;Chick Cancer&quot; but returns to Quahog as her career wanes. Stewie goes to the Quahog Mall where she is scheduled to make an appearance, intent on humiliating her, but instead ends up falling in love with her. With advice from Brian, Stewie attempts to woo her until she gives in to his efforts, and the two of them get &quot;married&quot;. Unfortunately, their past rivalry and Stewie&#x27;s jealousy of Olivia&#x27;s success hinders their relationship, leading to Olivia &quot;cheating&quot; on Stewie with her old friend Victor. In retaliation, Stewie burns down their cardboard house with Olivia and Victor inside. She returns alive and well in &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;; after once again running into Stewie, who is now performing with Brian as a children&#x27;s music duo named &quot;Red Shirt, Blue Shirt&quot;, Olivia tricks them into breaking up, and takes Stewie&#x27;s place as Red Shirt. However, Brian quits performing with Olivia during a concert, after seeing Stewie in the front row of the audience crying while they play one of Stewie&#x27;s original songs. Unfazed, she replaces Brian with another dog, who turns out to be Vinny.
* Paddy Tanniger (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is a short red-haired angry man who has been seen as a caddy manager and a Hummer salesman. He generally ends his statements with &quot;Big whoop, wanna fight about it?&quot; He was eventually killed when he was run over by a tank piloted by Brian and Stewie in &quot;Hell Comes to Quahog&quot;. It is mentioned on the DVD commentary for &quot;The Perfect Castaway&quot; that the character was disliked by nearly all the writing staff, which led to his death.
* Rupert (voiced by David Boat in &quot;Stewie Loves Lois&quot;, &quot;Stewie Kills Lois, &quot;Lois Kills Stewie&quot;, and &quot;Road to the North Pole&quot;, and by Derek Jacobi in &quot;Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Cheater&quot;) is a stuffed teddy bear that belongs to one-year-old Stewie Griffin. Though inanimate, Rupert has become his personal confidant and best friend. Stewie confides all his secrets and machinations in Rupert, and often gets upset when Rupert does not respond. Rupert has been known to double as a pistol when needed &quot;Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater&quot;. Rupert has been damaged several times. The first time in a flashback in &quot;Stu &amp; Stewie&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, Stewie argued with Brian about the economy and Brian decided to eat one of Rupert&#x27;s legs. Stewie got the leg back after a while. The second time involved encountering an unfamiliar Rottweiler dog in &quot;Stewie Loves Lois&quot;. Rupert was torn to shreds but was later sewn back together by Lois. In &quot;A Very Special Family Guy Freakin&#x27; Christmas&quot;, Stewie tears Rupert in two, after waking up from a Santa Claus-themed nightmare. In &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, Stewie shoots Rupert in the head with a gun rather than risk letting him die a worse death when he sees the cover of a Queen album. In &quot;The Man with Two Brians&quot;, he is humped by New Brian for two hours. Stewie is then shown dragging a body into the garbage, later revealed to be New Brian. At the end of the episode Stewie is shown crying in the shower and washing Rupert in despair, constantly reassuring him that it was not his fault. In &quot;Chick Cancer&quot;, when Stewie married Olivia Fuller, he had Rupert officiate the ceremony. &quot;8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter&quot; had the creation of Stewpert, a being where Stewie and Rupert were fused together after Stewie activated his teleportation device before he realized Rupert was inside, in reference to Brundlefly of &quot;The Fly&quot;. Stewie had several times referred to him as gay. Stewie accused Rupert of choosing to watch the boys in &quot;Road to Rhode Island&quot; as opposed to watching their bags as Stewie has told him to, much to Stewie&#x27;s chagrin. In the episode &quot;Road to Rupert&quot;. Brian accidentally sells Rupert causing both Brian and Stewie (after Brian confesses to selling Rupert by accident) to head off to the Swiss Alps to retrieve him from the family that he was sold to, eventually challenging the father of the family to a ski race to either get him back or give the family Brian as the stakes, Stewie does not respect the rules and throws hot tea in the other young boy&#x27; eyes blinding him long enough to grab Rupert, but Stewie later says that he was through with Rupert and was too old for him, saying &quot;...after all, Brian, I&#x27;m nearly one.&quot; Stewie has also imagined Rupert as a muscular, human male a few times, including in &quot;Road to the North Pole&quot;, where he builds a buff Rupert snowman in the opening credit sequence. However, Rupert retains his Teddy Bear head. In a DVD exclusive scene in &quot;Excellence in Broadcasting&quot;, Stewie explores the experience of fantasizing and in his fantasy buff Rupert makes out with an equally buff Brian while Stewie is tied to the bed. In the episode &quot;Lois Comes Out of Her Shell&quot;, Rupert&#x27;s head is ripped off by Stewie&#x27;s evil pet turtle Sheldon who Stewie enters a fight with in return. In &quot;Total Recall&quot;, the factory that made Rupert demands all bears are sent back due to them becoming a choking hazard. Lois in shock sends him back and Brian and Stewie go on a life-threatening quest to get him back, only just saving Rupert (and Stewie) from instant death on a furnace. As they return home, Stewie celebrates with Rupert only for Rupert&#x27;s eye to come off and Stewie to swallow it supposedly killing him with Chris who witnessed the scene casually shouting &quot;Mom, Stewie&#x27;s dead&quot;. In the episode &quot;Quagmire&#x27;s Quagmire&quot;, Stewie must decide whether to &quot;play&quot; with Rupert anymore after Lois finds his newborn plush toy, a blue, scruffy looking, bow-tied teddy bear named Oscar who was apparently given to him by Babs Pewterschmidt (his maternal grandmother) when Stewie was born. This fact is stated by Meg who is in the attic, organizing items from boxes along with Lois. Stewie treats Rupert like a nagging wife juxtaposed to Oscar&#x27;s imaginary role as the still loved ex-girlfriend. In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, Stewie is seen holding Rupert in court, while sitting next to Mr. Burns, holding his own teddy bear, Bobo. In &quot;Stewie, Chris &amp; Brian&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, Rupert tells the other stuffed animals that he is straight after Stewie and Brian leave with Chris in the time machine. In &quot;Dog Bites Bear&quot;, Brian accidentally destroys Rupert while drunk. He later replaces him with an identical looking bear that Stewie believes to be Rupert having returned from the dead. In the season 19 episode &quot;The Talented Mr. Stewie&quot; Stewie &quot;breaks up&quot; with Rupert after having found out he belonged to Chris before Stewie was born. Stewie then returns Rupert to Chris and in trying to fill the void starts playing with different stuffed animals, but to no avail. Eventually Stewie is driven by jealousy to kill Chris and Rupert. After realizing Chris planned on returning Rupert, Stewie saves a drowning Chris and reconciles with Rupert.
* Seamus Levine (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is a tough fisherman who is in his 60s and has two peg-legs as well as two peg arms. He wears a black eye-patch over his right eye. He makes his first appearance in the episode &quot;A Fish Out of Water&quot;. While spending time with Peter and the gang in a steam room, it is revealed his whole body from the neck down is wood. He tends to warn Peter of danger. Seamus had his own talk show in &quot;Perfect Castaway&quot;. In his premiere episode, he jokes that his father was a tree, but in the episode &quot;And Then There Were Fewer&quot; he blames his condition on James Woods. Seamus initially claims that Woods carved him from wood and did not wish hard enough for him to be a real boy, but he later revealed that they both got high on acid one day and Woods ate off Seamus&#x27; arms and legs, thinking that he was a steak. In &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Three and a Half&quot;, when Seamus is seen naked, his body is entirely wooden while his head is human, bringing into question how he can sustain life. He played Byron Hadley in the series&#x27; portrayal of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; which was seen the second of the &quot;Three kings&quot;. In a DVD exclusive scene, Seamus tries out for Fox News Channel in &quot;FOX-y Lady&quot;. He gets a ship in a bottle for Christmas in &quot;Road to the North Pole&quot;. In &quot;Tiegs for Two&quot;, he attends Quagmire&#x27;s class on how to pick up women. In &quot;Cool Hand Peter&quot;, Seamus attempts to join in Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire&#x27;s road trip only to be rejected by Peter. In &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, Seamus attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale where he was sitting next to Captain Horatio McCallister. In &quot;Christmas Is Coming&quot; his son Woody was introduced; he also has two peg-legs and two peg arms.

* Vinny Fuller (voiced by Tony Sirico) is a 5-year-old talking Italian greyhound whose first appearance in the franchise occurs in &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. After Brian is killed in a tragic car accident, the Griffin family decides to find another dog at the pet store to ease their grief. They meet Vinny, a pussyhound (he is 1/16th cat) of Italian descent. Each member of the family (save Stewie) is taken with Vinny, and he is adopted into their family. Stewie, still mourning the death of Brian, rebuffs the hound and makes several attempts to get him out of the family. However, once Stewie learns that Vinny had also undergone a period of mourning when his owner died in a freak yoga accident, he comes to accept the hound as part of the family. His personality is that of a streetwise, &quot;wise guy&quot; Italian American. In &quot;Christmas Guy&quot;, Vinny, upon asking around, finds out that Carter Pewterschmidt canceled an event at Quahog Mall, and reports this to the Griffin family. Vinny helps Stewie distract his past self so he can steal the return pad from his backpack and travel back in time to save Brian. Before Stewie goes back in time, he says his goodbyes to Vinny. Just before Stewie travels back in time, Vinny walks off shouting &quot;Georgette, I&#x27;m coming home!&quot;, at which Stewie questions who &quot;Georgette&quot; is. At the end of &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;, after Brian quits performing with Olivia Fuller as &quot;Red Shirt, Blue Shirt&quot;, she decides to replace him with another dog, who, according to Brian, is &quot;probably a dog neither [Stewie] or [he] has ever met&quot;; it is then revealed to the audience that Vinny was chosen to replace Brian as Olivia&#x27;s performance partner.

<text>Columbia–Greene Community College (Co-Greene or C-GCC) is a public community college in Hudson, New York. Founded in 1966, it is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system and is locally sponsored by two rural counties, Columbia and Greene, which have a combined population of about 112,000. The college was originally in Athens, New York until its permanent relocation to the City of Hudson in 1974. It currently offers 32 associate degree programs and five undergraduate certificate programs. C-GCC is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and enrolls approximately 1,578 students as of Fall 2018.

==History==
===Early beginnings===
In early 1966, the Columbia County Board of Supervisors together with the Greene County Legislature established a steering committee to determine the feasibility of jointly sponsoring a community college. By the end of the year, the SUNY Board of Trustees and the New York State Board of Regents granted initial funding and a charter to support the establishment of the college.

Columbia–Greene Community College officially opened its doors in September 1969 to a class of 350 full-time and part-time students under the leadership of the college&#x27;s first president, Edward J. Owen. Two years later, C-GCC awarded 35 associate degrees to its first graduating class during a small ceremony at Catskill High School. For its first five years, the college operated out of an old schoolhouse in Athens, New York. The college received full accreditation status by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in 1975.

===Campus relocation and expansion===
In 1974, the Columbia-Greene campus was permanently relocated to a 130,000 sq. ft. building, now referred to as the Main Building, in the Town of Greenport just outside the City of Hudson. In addition to expanded instructional spaces and administrative offices, the Main Building also included a two-story library, a gymnasium, fitness center, and a cafeteria.

In the spring of 1982, former President of the United States Gerald Ford was invited to the campus as the keynote speaker for a fundraising dinner hosted by the Columbia-Greene Community Foundation.

Columbia-Greene underwent its first expansion in June 1989 by adding three new buildings, including a new Technology Center which would house the expanding automotive technology program, an Arts Center which would contain the college&#x27;s first performing arts theatre, as well as a Day Care Center which would provide child care support for attending students.

In 2018, Columbia–Greene Community College began its first expansion project in decades by adding the New Construction Technology Program building on its main campus.

==Academics==
The college offers 38 academic degree and certificate programs under the Divisions of Arts &amp; Humanities, Behavioral and Social Sciences, Math and Science, Nursing, and Technology.

==Athletics==
C-GCC offers intercollegiate and intramural sports programs. It is a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Region III, and the Mountain Valley Athletic Conference where CGCC competes at the Division III level.

==Notable alumni==
*Mickey Brantley, former Major League Baseball player

<doc id="657696" wikidata="Q1756782" url="?curid=657696" title="Musth">
<text>Musth or must (from Persian, ) is a periodic condition in bull (male) elephants characterized by aggressive behavior and accompanied by a large rise in reproductive hormones. It has been known in Asian elephants for 3000 years but was only described in African elephants in 1981. Evidence indicates that similar behaviour occurred in extinct proboscideans like gomphotheres and mastodons.
Elephants often discharge a thick, tar-like secretion called temporin from the temporal gland during musth. Behavioral management for captive bull elephants in musth includes physical restraint and a starvation diet for several days to a week.

==Etymology==
Musth comes from an Urdu term for intoxication; in Persian it means .

==Biology==
Musth has been known in Asian elephants for 3000 years (described in the Rigveda 1500–1000 B.C.) but was recognized in African elephants only in the late twentieth century.

In 1975, scientists Joyce Poole and Cynthia Moss were working in Amboseli National Park, Kenya. Poole noticed a period of heightened reproductive activity and aggression in male African elephants. She began documenting and describing the physical and behavioral characteristics and temporal (time-related) dynamics among individual males. This led to scientifically identifying musth in African elephants. 

Musth is also suggested to have occurred in mammoths, given the testosterone histories from their tusks. Musth-like behaviour is also suggested to have occurred in South American gomphotheres and North American mastodons.

Musth differs from rut in that musth most often takes place in winter, whereas the female elephant&#x27;s estrus cycle is not seasonally linked.

==Physical characteristics==
Elephants in musth often discharge a thick tar-like secretion called temporin from the temporal gland located on the temporal sides of the head. Temporin contains proteins, lipids (including cholesterol), phenol and 4-methyl phenol, cresols and sesquiterpenes (notably farnesol and its derivatives). Secretions and urine collected from zoo elephants have been shown to contain elevated levels of various highly odorous ketones and aldehydes.

Testosterone levels in an elephant in musth can be on average 60 times greater than in the same elephant at other times (in specific individuals these testosterone levels can even reach as much as 140 times the norm).

==Behavioral characteristics==
Musth is believed to be linked to sexual arousal or establishing dominance. Wild bulls in musth often produce a characteristic low, pulsating rumbling noise known as &quot;musth rumble&quot; which other elephants can hear from miles away. The rumble has been shown to prompt not only attraction in the form of reply vocalizations from cows in heat, but also silent avoidance behavior from other bulls, particularly juveniles and non-receptive females, suggesting an evolutionary benefit to advertising the musth state.

A bull elephant in musth, wild or otherwise, is extremely dangerous to humans, other elephants, and other species. Bull elephants in musth have killed keepers/mahouts, as well as other bull elephants, female elephants, and calves (the last usually inadvertently or accidentally in what is often called &quot;herd infighting&quot;).

Between 1991-2001, young bull rogue elephants killed 63 rhinos of both genders (58 endangered white rhinos and 5 rare black rhinos) in two South African national parks (Hluhluwe–Imfolozi and Pilanesberg). This was ultimately attributed to an aberrant form of musth. After being rebuffed by older female elephants, they went after rhinos, killing them after raping some. Three young elephant bulls were shot which temporarily ended the killings. Some scientists opined this was an example of young male elephants permanently changed by the trauma of witnessing their breeding herds culled due to overcrowding in other South African parks. These young bulls had been spared themselves due to their age and size although herd culls are properly done in entirety, i.e. leaving no survivors to suffer the equivalents of PTSD, survivor guilt, and other disorders or traumas later in life which can then create or exacerbate human-elephant conflicts or other forms of violence, according to Ron Thomson, a late 20th-century Zimbabwe game warden and Parks Board veteran.

In the absence of older males whose presence inhibits musth in smaller younger bulls, these adolescent bulls had reached puberty (musth) prematurely which they could not control, resulting in the &quot;warped behavior of animals who have lost their elders, and who are now flailing in a diminished, disarranged world.&quot; It is established that functionally important decision-making abilities may be significantly altered by disruption of the natural structure of kin-based social relationships and that violent disruption &quot;appears capable of driving aberrant behaviours in social animals that are akin to the post-traumatic stress disorder experienced by humans following extremely traumatic events&quot; due to the pachyderms&#x27; intelligence, strong emotional family attachments, and prodigious memories.

Another interrelated but more generalized theory of why the young elephants went wild was that, owing to culls and herd fragmentation, there were no older elephants to teach and discipline them.

South African ecologist and ranger Gus van Dyk, who thought of the idea of reintroducing older males into Pilanesberg to prevent younger males from entering musth, noted that no further rhinoceros killings were observed.

===Management===

In Sri Lanka and India, domesticated Asian elephants in musth are traditionally tied to a strong tree and denied food and water or put on a starvation diet from several days to a week which shortens the duration of the musth, typically to five to eight days. Sedatives, like xylazine, are also sometimes used. Zoos keeping adult male elephants need strong, purpose-built enclosures to isolate males during their musth.

==In popular culture==
* Valmiki, in &quot;Sundara Kanda&quot; of the Ramayana (7th to 4th centuries BCE), made reference to the Mahendra mountain shedding water like an elephant&#x27;s rut juice upon being pressed by Hanuman.
* In the &quot;Matanga Lila&quot; (300 BCE to 300 CE) musth is described: &quot;Excitement, swiftness, odor, love passion, complete florescence of the body, wrath, prowess, and fearlessness are declared to be the eight excellences of musth.&quot;
* Sangam poetry (300 BCE to 300 CE) describes musth. Kummatoor Kannanaar in Pathitrupatthu 12 describes it as follows:
* References to elephants in musth (whose temporin secretion is often referred to as &quot;ichor&quot;) are for example in the &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; (4th–5th century CE), wher Kalidasa wrote that the king&#x27;s elephants drip ichor in seven streams to match the scent put forth by the seven-leaved &#x27;sapta-cchada&#x27; (= &quot;seven-leaf&quot;) tree (perhaps &quot;Alstonia scholaris&quot;). 
* In Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; (1872), Phileas Fogg buys an elephant which was being fed sugar and butter so it would go into musth for combat purposes; however, the animal had been on this regimen only for a relatively short time so the condition has not yet presented.
* &quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot; is an autobiographical account by George Orwell written in 1936, in which he describes how an elephant in Burma had an attack of musth and killed an Indian, which in turn led to the shooting of the elephant.
* In his James Bond novel &quot;The Man With the Golden Gun&quot; (1965), Ian Fleming wrote that the villain Francisco Scaramanga was driven to become a cold-blooded assassin after authorities shot an elephant that he had ridden in his circus act because the elephant went on a rampage while in musth.
* The Tamil movie &quot;Kumki&quot; (2012), which revolves around a mahout and his trained elephant, shows the elephant in musth towards the climax. Captive elephants are either trained for duties in temples and cultural festivals or trained as a kumki elephant which confronts wild elephants and prevents them from entering villages. Elephants trained for temple duties are of a gentle nature and cannot face wild elephants. In this movie, a tribal village wants to hire a kumki elephant to chase away wild elephants which enter the village every harvest season. The mahout, who needs money, takes his temple-trained elephant to do this job, in the vain hope that wild elephants will not come in. But wild elephants start attacking the village on the harvest day. The temple-trained elephant enters musth and thus fights with the wild elephants, kills the most notorious among the herd but dies from injuries sustained during the fight.

<text>Willian is a village and former civil parish, adjoining the town of Letchworth, in the North Hertfordshire district of Hertfordshire, England. Along with Norton and Old Letchworth, it is one of the original three villages around which the garden city of Letchworth Garden City was created. Despite this, the village retains a separate character to the rest of Letchworth Garden City. In 1931 the parish had a population of 210.

==History==
The village was referred to in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wilie&quot;, and the name probably derives from a word meaning &quot;willows&quot;. There is no explicit mention of a church or priest at Willian in the Domesday Book, but the current parish church of All Saints seems to have been started a few years later in the early twelfth century.

In 1903 much of the land in the parish of Willian and the neighbouring parishes of Letchworth and Norton was purchased for the development of the first garden city, which took its name from the smallest of the three old parishes, Letchworth. The area north of Willian village was gradually developed through the twentieth century as part of the newly-created town. 

The solicitor and historian Reginald Hine lived in the village from 1929 until his death in 1949.

==Governance==
Willian was an ancient parish in the hundred of Broadwater.

The parish of Willian was included in the Hitchin Poor Law Union from 1835. The eastern side of the parish of Willian extended to the edge of the town of Baldock, and in 1880 the Baldock Local Board was given control of the parts of Willian parish where the town&#x27;s urban area was starting to expand into Willian. The following year the parish boundary between Willian and Baldock was adjusted to match the local board boundary.

Under the Local Government Act 1894, the parish of Willian became part of the Hitchin Rural District. Following the commencement of work on Letchworth Garden City in 1903, it became necessary to review administrative arrangements in the area. The civil parish of Letchworth was substantially enlarged in 1908 to take over all of Norton parish and the northern part of Willian parish. The reduced civil parish of Willian thereafter covered the village itself and the rural areas generally to the south of the village. The civil parish of Willian was abolished in 1935, being absorbed into Letchworth Urban District on 1 April 1935. Since then the village has been administered as part of Letchworth, which became part of North Hertfordshire in 1974.

==Geography==
The village has two public houses: the Fox, built in 1870 and the Three Horseshoes, dating from the late eighteenth century. The village also has a village shop, which incorporates a Post Office, and a large pond. The parish church of All Saints has a tower with clocks on two sides; two sides are blank, supposedly so that farm labourers would not be able to tell when to leave work. This continues to be an active parish church in the village. Its daughter church of St Paul&#x27;s, Letchworth became a separate parish church in 1963.

== Student life ==
Dutchess Community College has a variety of departments and programs dedicated to engaging students and promoting success, all of which are operated by the Department of Student Services. The Department of Student Services has, under its operating umbrella, offices including Health Services, Student Activities, Intercollegiate Athletics, Admissions, and Counseling Services, including many others. Health Services operate the on-campus health center and offers minor medical treatment to DCC students free of charge. The Office of Intercollegiate Activities is responsible for operating and maintaining all sports teams on campus. Sports available for men include soccer, basketball, and baseball. Women&#x27;s sports include volleyball, softball, basketball, and starting in the fall of 2017, soccer. The Office of Student Activities manages student trips, guest speaker lectures, family festivals, on-campus events, the Student Government Association (SGA) and all on-campus clubs.

== Fishkill site ==

In Fall 2021, Dutchess Community College opened a new satellite center called DCC@Fishkill, approximately south of the main campus, at the site of the former Dutchess Mall&#x27;s Jamesway anchor store. The Fishkill facility has 20 multi-purpose classrooms, a versatile design, a fully equipped biology lab, and a networked computer classroom. 

Located in the Fishkill campus is the Center of Excellence for Industry and Innovation, a mechatronics lab, with three rooms set up as a Mechanical lab, an Electrical/Automation lab and a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning lab. The college offers hands-on learning needed to support installation, maintenance, repair, calibration and troubleshooting of systems including controls and machine-to-machine networks.

On October 6, 2023, First Lady of the United States Jill Biden toured the DCC@Fishkill facility, particularly the newly opened Mechatronics lab.

Previously, Dutchess Community College had a satellite branch in Wappingers Falls, called Dutchess South, which operated from at least the early 1990s until 2021. It closed upon the opening of the Fishkill location.

== Community involvement ==
=== The Bridge Program ===
In an effort to more effectively prepare students for college, as well as to draw more students to the college, DCC instituted the Bridge Program. This allows local high school students to take certain DCC classes on the campus. These classes are primarily entry-level English classes, but can range from government to calculus courses, depending on the proficiency of the student. While the majority of local high schools allow their students to travel to DCC for these classes, a few do not. One notable exception is Poughkeepsie High School, which only allows its students to take the college courses in the high school building itself. Teachers must be specially certified by both Poughkeepsie High School and by DCC in order for the classes to be counted as college credit.

=== The Charles E. &amp; Mabel E. Conklin Scholarship for Academic Excellence ===
Established in 2003, the Charles &amp; Mabel Conklin Scholarship provides students with the full cost of tuition for four semesters at DCC. The scholarship is open to graduating seniors attending a high school in Dutchess County that graduate in the top 10% of their class. 43 students were awarded the Charles E. &amp; Mabel E. Conklin Scholarship in 2016.

<doc id="657718" wikidata="Q2706202" url="?curid=657718" title="Bib Fortuna">
<text>Bib Fortuna is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. The Twi&#x27;lek majordomo and chief aide of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, Bib is Jabba&#x27;s closest associate, succeeding him as daimyo after his death before ultimately being killed himself by Boba Fett. Fortuna first appeared in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), the final entry in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. He also appeared briefly in the prequel trilogy film &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) and in the second season of Disney+ series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2020) and &quot;The Bad Batch&quot; (2021). The character has also appeared in other &quot;Star Wars&quot; media, including novels, comic books, video games, and radio dramas.

Fortuna was created by &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; co-writers Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, and was designed by Phil Tippett based upon early sketches by concept artists Nilo Rodis-Jamero and Ralph McQuarrie. The character was portrayed by Michael Carter in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, who was cast based upon his stage acting experience; the actor did not know it was a &quot;Star Wars&quot; film until after he accepted the role. Erik Bauersfeld provided the voice of Fortuna in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and sound editor Matthew Wood portrayed the character in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;.

Although few details about him were revealed in his film appearances, other &quot;Star Wars&quot; works have established Fortuna&#x27;s back story, including his past as a slave trader who was sentenced to death on his home planet of Ryloth. Although he outwardly appears loyal and obedient to Jabba, Fortuna secretly despises his master and actively plots to assassinate him and take over his criminal operation. Fortuna survives the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; in the &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; canon, which encompasses all licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; stories outside of the films prior to The Walt Disney Company acquiring the franchise in 2012. The new set of official canon created after that acquisition also establishes that Fortuna was not killed during the climactic battle in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and he assumed Jabba&#x27;s place as crime lord until being killed and succeeded by Boba Fett five years later.

It took about eight-and-a-half hours to apply the character&#x27;s makeup for the first time in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, which included extensive casts and molds, a large rubber headpiece, day glow orange contact lenses, sharpened false teeth, and claw-like finger extensions. Fortuna has been described as a fan-favorite and one of the most memorable characters from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and has been included on several lists of the best characters in the franchise. Several toys and merchandise works have been created for the character, and an original action figure prototype sold for in a 2019 auction.

==Character biography==
===Backstory===
Bib Fortuna is a member of the Twi&#x27;lek species, humanoids distinguished by the pair of long tentacular appendages that protrude from the back of their heads, which are known as lekku. Fortuna is the first Twi&#x27;lek character to appear in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, although the species did not receive a name until the publication of the &quot;Star Wars Sourcebook&quot;, a 1987 sourcebook for &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot;. With pale, mucus-covered skin and sharp, snaggly teeth, Fortuna is originally from the planet Ryloth, the Twi&#x27;lek homeworld. Fortuna works as the majordomo and chief aide for Jabba the Hutt, a slug-like alien and one of the most powerful crime lords in the galaxy. In this capacity, Fortuna controls most operations within Jabba&#x27;s palace on the desert planet of Tatooine. Among these duties are welcoming visitors who come to the palace, and vetting them before they appear before Jabba. Fortuna&#x27;s dialogue in the film is delivered in Huttese, the fictional language also spoken by Jabba.

Outside of the films, Bib Fortuna&#x27;s back story was established through media in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe, which encompasses all licensed stories in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe outside of the nine main feature films, such as novels, comic books, video games, and television shows. With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014. As a result, storylines and character histories established for Fortuna before April 2014 are part of the Legends canon, but not the Disney canon.

In his back story established by the Expanded Universe, Bib Fortuna is born into a family engaged in the Outer Rim portion of the galaxy. He grows wealthy as a slave trader before working for Jabba the Hutt, selling fellow members of his own species into servitude. Fortuna is also a smuggler of an illicit substance called spice, and is one of the first to widely sell a highly addictive drug called ryll from Ryloth to other planets. This brings Ryloth to the attention of the Galactic Empire, and leads to a planetwide breakdown of order. Fortuna becomes infamous as a result, and is sentenced to death on his home planet, but he escapes and flees to the planet Tatooine. There he becomes the head of Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s smuggling operations for a drug called glitterstim, the first in a series of successively more prominent positions that eventually leads him to becoming Jabba&#x27;s majordomo. Fortuna later returns to Ryloth with an army of Jabba&#x27;s henchmen to enact revenge for his death sentence, burning seven of the planet&#x27;s cities and capturing slaves and riches for Jabba. Fortuna harbors ambitions of one day returning to Ryloth and ruling the planet.

Other &quot;Star Wars&quot; books and media have established that Fortuna is responsible for the presence of several of the creatures and characters in Jabba&#x27;s palace during &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. For example, the rancor that Jabba keeps underneath a trap door in his throne room was originally presented to him by Fortuna as a birthday gift. Fortuna kidnaps Oola, the green-skinned Twi&#x27;lek female who appears in scenes in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; as a slave and dancer for Jabba. After abducting her, Fortuna arranged for her to be trained in exotic dancing and told her stories about Jabba&#x27;s palace that falsely portrayed it as a glamorous and exciting place, making Oola so eager to be there that she rejected opportunities to escape. Fortuna also originally captured Salacious B. Crumb, a small creature that sat beside Jabba&#x27;s tail on his throne and served as a court jester in the palace. Crumb was a stowaway thief aboard Jabba&#x27;s ship when Fortuna captured him and presented him to Jabba before the events of the film.

===&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;===
Bib Fortuna makes his first appearance in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), the final film in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. The film begins with Han Solo, one of the protagonists of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, being held captive by Jabba the Hutt and frozen in a slab of metal substance called carbonite. Bib Fortuna is first seen in the film when he greets the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, who enter the palace to deliver a message to Jabba. Fortuna greets them coldly at first, but becomes intrigued upon learning they have a gift for the Hutt. He attempts to obtain more information about the gift, but the droids insist their instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. Fortuna brings the droids before Jabba, where they deliver a holographic message from the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker seeking to bargain for the release of Han Solo. Fortuna whispers advice into Jabba&#x27;s ear and feeds him information as Jabba sits on his throne. He is later present with Jabba when Princess Leia Organa, who infiltrated the palace by disguising herself as a bounty hunter named Boushh, is captured while freeing Han Solo from carbonite.

Jabba gives orders to Fortuna that Luke Skywalker is not to be admitted to the palace. When Skywalker later arrived, Fortuna is among the first to intercept him and initially forbids him from speaking to Jabba. However, Luke uses the Force to influence Fortuna&#x27;s mind, convincing him to take Skywalker before Jabba. When Jabba realizes Skywalker used a &quot;Jedi mind trick&quot; on Fortuna, he angrily scolds Fortuna, calls him a &quot;weak-minded fool&quot;, and throws him off the throne room dais. Fortuna later travels with Jabba aboard the Hutt&#x27;s sail barge to the planned executions of Skywalker, Solo, and Solo&#x27;s first mate Chewbacca at the Great Pit of Carkoon, where they are to be fed to a creature called a sarlacc. A skirmish breaks out between Skywalker and his friends and Jabba&#x27;s thugs, resulting in the death of Jabba and the destruction of the sail barge. Fortuna&#x27;s fate after these events is left ambiguous in the film.

In the Expanded Universe/&quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; continuity, Fortuna survives the battle, escaping before the sail barge&#x27;s destruction and returning to Jabba&#x27;s palace to attempt to take over his criminal enterprise. His fate in the official canon is similar.

===&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;===
Bib Fortuna appears briefly in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), the first film in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy. He stands alongside Jabba the Hutt during the podrace, from which a young Anakin Skywalker emerges victorious. At one point, Fortuna wakes up Jabba after the Hutt crime lord falls asleep during the podrace. Since &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; was set 32 years before the events of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, Fortuna&#x27;s presence establishes that he has been employed by Jabba the Hutt for more than three decades, dating back to the final years of the Galactic Republic.

===&quot;The Mandalorian&quot;===
In a post-credits scene of the second season finale &quot;Chapter 16: The Rescue&quot; of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, a corpulent Bib Fortuna is depicted as the new owner of Jabba&#x27;s palace. During this time as owner he has put his own mark on the palace, added his own humanoid throne upon Jabba&#x27;s old plinth, taken up having his own slave girl and indulged in eating fine foods and putting on weight. He is killed by Boba Fett, who takes his throne. In &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; episode &quot;Chapter 4: The Gathering Storm&quot;, Bib Fortuna&#x27;s death at Boba Fett’s hand is briefly shown again via archive footage from &quot;Chapter 16: The Rescue&quot;.

===Other &quot;Star Wars&quot; media===
====&quot;Legends&quot; canon====
One of Bib Fortuna&#x27;s first non-film appearances is in &quot;A Rancor Comes to Tatooine&quot;, a short story included in &quot;The Star Wars Sourcebook&quot; (1987). The story describes the rivalry between Fortuna and a Corellian named Bidlo Kwerve, both of whom are competing to become Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s majordomo in a period prior to &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Kwerve and Fortuna acquire the rancor as a birthday gift for Jabba, and Fortuna earns the majordomo job, while Kwerve is ultimately eaten by the rancor. This storyline is expanded upon in &quot;Tales from Jabba&#x27;s Palace&quot;, a 1995 anthology book written from the perspectives of multiple background characters in the Jabba&#x27;s palace scenes of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. In the book, after Jabba receives the rancor gift, he offers Fortuna and Kwerve a choice of two rewards: one can become his majordomo, while the other will receive an unspecified &quot;greater honor&quot;. Sensing a trap, Fortuna accepts the majordomo position, thus saving his own life and ensuring Kwerve&#x27;s death when the greater honor turns out to be the distinction of being the first person Jabba feeds to his new rancor.

Fortuna appears in several of the stories in &quot;Tales from Jabba&#x27;s Palace&quot;, and the book establishes that Fortuna despises Jabba and is actively plotting to assassinate the Hutt, steal his wealth, and take over his criminal operation. It also establishes Fortuna&#x27;s personality as cunning and calculating, and that Fortuna&#x27;s deferential attitude toward his employer is a facade. Fortuna&#x27;s back story is particularly expanded upon in the short story &quot;Of the Day&#x27;s Annoyances: Bib Fortuna&#x27;s Tale&quot;, by M. Shayne Bell. In that story, Fortuna protects his friend Nat Secura, whom Jabba wants to kill by feeding him to the rancor. Secura is the last descendant of a great Twi&#x27;lek house, and Fortuna uses Secura&#x27;s power to sell other Twi&#x27;leks into slavery. To protect Secura, Fortuna seeks assistance from his allies, the mysterious B&#x27;omarr monks, religious beings that have transplanted their brains into nutrient-filled jars attached to spider-like droid walkers. Fortuna has the monks remove Secura&#x27;s brain shortly before Secura&#x27;s body, under Jabba&#x27;s orders, is thrown to the rancor and eaten. When Jabba is later killed on his sail barge by Princess Leia at the Great Pit of Carkoon, Fortuna watches the Hutt die and does nothing to prevent it. Fortuna then flees on his private skiff and returns to Jabba&#x27;s palace, where he expects to take over the criminal operation. There, however, the monks decide the best fate for Fortuna is for his own brain to be transferred into one of their droid walkers, and they remove and transfer his brain against his will.

Fortuna appears in his disembodied droid walker form in a four-issue arc of the &quot;Star Wars: X-wing Rogue Squadron&quot; comic book entitled &quot;Battleground: Tatooine&quot; (1996). In it, he is the captive of Firith Olan, a fellow Twi-lek criminal who Fortuna had called to Tatooine prior to the death of Jabba the Hutt. Upon arriving and finding Fortuna&#x27;s brain trapped in a droid walker, Olan begins operating his own criminal enterprise out of Jabba&#x27;s palace, taking delight in mocking and torturing the helpless Fortuna. After Olan becomes injured, Fortuna has his own consciousness transferred into Olan&#x27;s body, leaving Olan&#x27;s brain now trapped within the droid. Afterward, Fortuna resumes his life of crime. Fortuna is also one of the main characters in the comic book &quot;Star Wars: Jabba the Hutt: Betrayal&quot; (1996), which is set before &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. In the comic, Fortuna plots a revolt among Jabba&#x27;s slaves, with the intention of capturing Jabba and taking over his criminal enterprise. The plot fails when it is interrupted by a separate assassination attempt against Jabba. One of Fortuna&#x27;s co-conspirators, a red-skinned alien named Nivek, nearly gives Fortuna&#x27;s plot away in front of Jabba, but Fortuna shoots him in the head to silence him.

Fortuna appears in the 2000 video game &quot;Star Wars: Demolition&quot;, in which the player participates in vehicular combat contests at the behest of Jabba the Hutt. Fortuna can be seen in the menu screen describing the various terrains the player could choose for the battles. Fortuna is a playable character in the video games &quot;Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy&quot; (2006) and &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot; (2007). He also appears in the webcomic &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Valsedian Operation&quot;, which was first published between 2010 and 2011. In the comic, a group of Jedi including Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano investigate an illegal mining operation using slave labor in the Valsedian asteroid belt. The Jedi are informed of it by Jabba the Hutt, who believes his distant cousin Torpo is running the operation. However, upon investigation, the Jedi learn that the venture is secretly masterminded by Bib Fortuna. Fortuna plays a supporting role in &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Gambit&quot;, a radio drama recorded live at &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration VI in Orlando, Florida in August 2012. The story follows Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Princess Leia searching for a location for a new Rebel base following the events of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. After Solo and Chewbacca are captured and placed on sale at an auction, Fortuna attempts to buy them on behalf of Jabba the Hutt, entering into a bidding war with Prince Xizor of the Black Sun criminal organization.

====Official canon====
Fortuna appears in the mobile strategy game &quot;Star Wars Commander&quot; (2014), in which he becomes involved in a conflict with a mercenary named Saponza. After Saponza kills multiple henchmen of Jabba the Hutt who had interfered with his property on Tatooine, Fortuna arranges for Saponza&#x27;s home to be burned down. Fortuna makes a brief appearance in the first issue of the &quot;Star Wars: Darth Vader&quot; comic book series, released by Marvel Comics in February 2015. In the comic, Darth Vader forcibly enters Jabba&#x27;s palace to meet with the Hutt, and Fortuna briefly tries to stop him, but becomes frightened and allows him to pass after Vader threatens him with his lightsaber. The scene mirrors that of Fortuna confronting Luke Skywalker as he enters the palace in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, but establishes a direct contrast between Luke&#x27;s non-aggressive behavior toward Fortuna and Vader&#x27;s more threatening manner. 

Fortuna gets his own anthology story written by Kwame Mbalia in the 2023 book &quot;From a Certain Point of View: Return of the Jedi&quot;. The story, titled &quot;Fortuna Favors the Bold&quot;, reveals that Fortuna had plotted to overthrow Jabba during the events of Return of the Jedi.

A Twi&#x27;lek character named Beezer Fortuna, a cousin of Bib Fortuna, appears in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; anthology film &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016), which is set shortly before the events of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. Beezer&#x27;s look is based upon preliminary sketches of Bib Fortuna from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. His nickname among &quot;Rogue One&quot;&#x27;s crew during production was &quot;Cousin Bib&quot;, so Lucasfilm executive Pablo Hidalgo made their familial connection official while writing Beezer&#x27;s back story. The character&#x27;s first name derives from the &quot;High Beeser of Hoth&quot;, a title belonging to Bib Fortuna in early &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; drafts, but which was ultimately abandoned in later versions. In &quot;Rogue One&quot;, Beezer is one of the chief strategists of an extremist rebel faction led by Saw Gerrera, and he can be seen in the group&#x27;s hideout on the planet Jedha. According to Beezer&#x27;s back story, he resents his family&#x27;s participation in the criminal underworld, and is more politically-minded than his other relatives. The actor who portrayed Beezer Fortuna was fitted with contact lenses to make him more closely resemble Bib Fortuna.

==Characterization==
Outwardly, Bib Fortuna appears very loyal and obedient to Jabba the Hutt, hardly ever leaving his side, and regularly supplying him with advice and counsel. He demonstrates tremendous patience when dealing with Jabba&#x27;s bad habits, enduring his mood swings, and occasionally violent outbursts. Fortuna also employs this patience while dealing with Jabba&#x27;s visitors, who range from drunken thugs to overbearing emissaries. However, &quot;Star Wars&quot; media and works outside of the films have established that Fortuna&#x27;s obedience and good manners toward Jabba are almost entirely an act, and that internally he serves his own interests and actively plots against his employer. In reality, Fortuna feels a deep contempt for Jabba, as he reveals to his co-conspirators during a plot to kidnap and eventually assassinate the Hutt in the 1996 comic book &quot;Star Wars: Jabba the Hutt: Betrayal&quot;:

Fortuna is a powerful and dreaded individual in the galaxy&#x27;s underground community, though also somewhat cowardly, and has a large capacity for cruelty and violence. His sadism is on display in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, where he looks forward to seeing Luke Skywalker and his friends get fed to the sarlacc. Fortuna has a very vindictive personality, demonstrated by his attack against his home planet of Ryloth as an act of revenge for the death sentence he previously received there. He often resorts to underhanded means to achieve his objectives, acting out against friends and foes alike. This was exemplified by his willingness to kill one of his allies, the alien Nivek in &quot;Jabba the Hutt: Betrayal&quot;, when he risked exposing Fortuna&#x27;s plot to assassinate Jabba. Fortuna is cunning and manipulative, illustrated by the way in which he presents himself to Jabba as meek and passive in order to achieve his goals. However, Skywalker&#x27;s use of the Force to influence his mind in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; indicates Fortuna lacks a strong will, as Jedi mind tricks are more effective against weak-minded and susceptible individuals. Michael Carter, the actor who portrayed Bib Fortuna in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, said he found the character &quot;stupid in an endearing way&quot; and &quot;quite innocent, yet quite scary&quot;, and believed he could have led a good life if he had been raised in a different place.

==Concept and creation==
===Conception===
Bib Fortuna was created by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, co-writers of the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; screenplay. In early drafts of the script, Fortuna was referred to by the title &quot;High Beeser of Hoth&quot;, a reference to the planet Hoth, the ice planet that served as the home of a secret Rebel base in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Initially, the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; screenplay did not specify that Fortuna belonged to an alien species, but he was described in the final script as &quot;a humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull&quot;.

Fortuna was designed by Phil Tippett, the visual effects artist who designed most of the creatures for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Early sketches of the character were drawn by concept artists Nilo Rodis-Jamero, and Ralph McQuarrie. Several of these sketches looked very different from Fortuna as he appeared in the final film. For example, one of Rodis-Jamero&#x27;s sketches portrayed Fortuna with a thin, cylindrical head with gills along the sides, and another with a flat-topped, triangularly-shaped head. Those discarded sketches served as the basis for another &quot;Star Wars&quot; species called the Adnerem, which appear in the &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot; and other later works. Other variations by Rodis-Jamero presented Fortuna in blue, priest-like robes, occasionally holding a sceptre, with a lined, elongated face and narrow slits for eyes and nostrils.

McQuarrie&#x27;s early sketches of Bib Fortuna were, in his words, &quot;more human&quot; than the final design. He drew several versions with a variety of alien faces, as well as various costume elements like a tall top hat, and silver snow goggles, the latter of which George Lucas particularly enjoyed. McQuarrie said his early Bib Fortuna sketches were among his favorite renderings from the entire &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, though he said the final version was better and &quot;weirder&quot; than his early designs. One of Rodis-Jamero&#x27;s concepts was the one ultimately selected, and maquettes of the character were created by &quot;Monster Shop&quot; of Industrial Light &amp; Magic, the motion picture visual effects company founded by Lucas.

===Costume and makeup===
Bib Fortuna&#x27;s costume in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was designed by Rodis-Jamero and Aggie Guerard Rodgers, and Nick Dudman worked as a makeup artist on the character. Fortuna involved the first prosthetic makeup Dudman worked upon. Michael Carter, the actor who portrayed Fortuna, spent three months undergoing extensive makeup casts and tests for the character at Elstree Studios before shooting began. Molds were made from his hands and head. Several foam appliances were sculpted to conform to Carter&#x27;s face, and molds were made and cast into foam latex, which were then trimmed and carefully glued to the actor&#x27;s face. It took about eight-and-a-half hours to apply the makeup to Carter the first time, though the process was eventually reduced to slightly under an hour. Carter had been told a great deal of makeup would be involved with the part, but he said, &quot;I did not know what I was letting myself in for when it came to having to wear so much makeup. It did come as a bit of a shock.&quot;

Carter wore a large rubber headpiece, which included two large, slug-like tentacles that twisted around his neck. Each tentacle was five feet long and draped ornamentally around Fortuna&#x27;s shoulders. The headpiece included a large waddle dangling underneath his chin, and large bulges above each of his eyes, which were intended to be sensory brain areas. An intricate set of &quot;air bladders&quot;, or foam and latex bubbles, were fitted onto Carter&#x27;s temples and brows and inflated via hoses operated off-screen to give the impression of pulsation. Once the headpiece was placed on, Carter had to wear it for the remainder of the shooting day, which was often difficult for the actor. During one day, Carter had an itch for six hours that became so uncomfortable that Dudman split the headpiece down the middle so Carter could scratch it. After that point, the headpiece was specifically designed so it could be opened up the middle. As Carter sweated due to the heat under the costume, the makeup would start to come loose and the glue would dissolve, requiring it to be constantly reapplied.

Carter wore dayglow orange contact lenses, which created a glowing effect for the character&#x27;s eyes, something specifically requested by director Richard Marquand. Carter felt they gave Bib Fortuna &quot;a feminine look&quot;. They were hard contact lenses, which covered the entire surface of Carter&#x27;s eyeballs, except for holes drilled through the middles. This gave him tunnel vision and severely limited his ability to see, and he kept accidentally walking into parts of the set as a result. An optician was available for Carter at all times during filming to apply the lenses. Carter said the contacts were made in &quot;too much of a rush&quot; and were too small, so he suffered abrasions of the cornea, slightly hindering his vision until about a week after filming ended. Carter also wore sharp, pointed teeth, which were filed down to create what Tippett called a &quot;ghastly focal point&quot; for his dialogue scenes. The teeth would occasionally slip out of Carter&#x27;s mouth during shooting, at times striking against actors or crew members around him. The teeth made it difficult for the actor to speak, and he had to strongly articulate Fortuna&#x27;s lines to make the lip-movement look appropriate.

The costume consisted of a three-layer velveteen overcoat over a turquoise faille gown, with knee-high boots custom made by London shoemaker Anello &amp; Davide. The shoes were soft-soled, and meant to allow for silent movement. Carter wore lifts on his feet to make himself taller, and props inside his costume made his arms appear longer. Claws were placed on his fingertips, fitted through fingerless gloves that Tippett said gave Fortuna &quot;a spidery reach&quot;. Carter said the makeup had &quot;an immediate effect&quot; and once it was fully applied he would &quot;kind of meditate it for a moment&quot; because it ultimately helped dictate his performance. However, he also said the large amount of makeup made acting more difficult, adding: &quot;I was a big pile of moving rubber. And when I wasn&#x27;t moving, I was like a piece of furniture.&quot; Due to strict security measures to prevent secrets of the film being leaked to the public, whenever Carter was brought outside to be moved to and from the set at Elstree Studios, he was covered with a dustbin liner so he would not be seen. Carter would stand very still between takes to avoid disrupting the makeup, and occasionally crew members, seeing him standing among the various puppets and alien props, would believe he was a prop and attempt to lift him.

Makeup artist Shaune Harrison worked on the Bib Fortuna character in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, as well as several other creatures and aliens in the film, including Jar Jar Binks.

===Filming===
It took five weeks to film Bib Fortuna&#x27;s scenes for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Michael Carter initially received little information about the character except that he was &quot;an alien, and not a very nice one&quot;. Due to the secrecy surrounding the film, Carter was only given the script pages that included his specific scenes. He got them about four days before filming began, with all dialogue and information about other characters redacted. Since Fortuna&#x27;s dialogue was in an alien language, and since he had little knowledge about the rest of the film, Carter did not know anything about the storyline of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; during the filming process. In order to realistically deliver dialogue in a fictional language, Carter would make up his own meaning for the words he was speaking, which made it easier for him to find the correct vocal delivery and facial expressions for the performance.

Carter was present from the very first day of shooting on January 11, 1982, which marked the final costume test on Stage 6 of Elstree Studios, in the set for the corridor of Jabba&#x27;s palace. The scenes in which Bib Fortuna and Luke Skywalker meet at the palace entrance were filmed on January 12 and 13. During filming for Bib Fortuna&#x27;s first chronological appearance in the film, when he first meets R2-D2 and C-3PO, Carter could not see the mark on the ground where he was supposed to stop due to the limited visibility caused by his contact lenses. As a result, the crew set up a 2-by-4 piece of wood on the ground for him to stop his feet against. During the first take of the shot, Carter tripped over the board and fell. During another scene, Bib Fortuna lifts a captured Princess Leia and pushes her toward Jabba the Hutt, so he can lick her. While filming the scene, Carter misjudged actress Carrie Fisher&#x27;s weight, and lifted her so quickly that he nearly pushed her straight into the mouth of the Jabba puppet, causing her to scream.

Several scenes involving Fortuna were cut from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, including one in which Salacious B. Crumb, the small creature that sits at the tail of Jabba the Hutt, vomits into Fortuna&#x27;s beverage. In another cut scene, Fortuna engages in a provocative dance with Jess, one of Jabba&#x27;s dancers, who was portrayed by Amanda Noar. George Lucas eliminated the scene because he felt it was inappropriate for children. Another cut scene involved a longer exchange between Luke Skywalker and Fortuna after Skywalker first appeared at Jabba&#x27;s palace. In the original scene, the two had a long period of dialogue while walking down the corridor, with both actors speaking the fictional language of Huttese. During one take, Carter had to shout at Skywalker, and his false teeth accidentally came out and hit actor Mark Hamill&#x27;s face. The scene was ultimately cut and a shorter scene with Fortuna and Skywalker speaking in a stairway was used instead. During filming, both actors spoke in English, but Fortuna&#x27;s dialogue was dubbed in Huttese later.

==Portrayals==
===Michael Carter===
The role of Bib Fortuna was cast very early in the production process for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; because makeup artist Stuart Freeborn wanted to get started on creating the character&#x27;s look as quickly as possible. Michael Carter came to the attention of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; casting director Mary Selway, who saw him perform in a musical in the West End theatre section of London in the early 1980s. Director Richard Marquand had also seen and enjoyed Carter&#x27;s theater work, and wanted to cast him as Fortuna; Marquand described him as a &quot;terrific actor&quot;. He was also drawn to Carter for the role because he wanted Fortuna to be very tall, and Carter was about six feet tall.

Marquand invited Carter to meet at a studio in Elstree Studios to discuss a role he was casting in a film, which Marquand would only identify by its fake working title &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;. Carter was performing on a television series at the time. Carter&#x27;s train was late and Marquand was in a meeting when he arrived, and the front desk forgot to inform Marquand that he arrived, so Carter waited for an hour without being called in. Marquand happened upon Carter as he was leaving for the day, and the meeting took place. During the 30-minute meeting, Marquand informed him the part was an alien in a science-fiction film, also describing it as a children&#x27;s film, and that Carter could have the role without auditioning if he wanted it, but Marquand could not discuss any details about the character or film because it was a &quot;top secret Hollywood movie&quot;. Carter was initially not sure the part interested him, but Marquand persisted, and Carter reluctantly agreed. Only then did Marquand reveal that it was a &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. Carter was sworn to secrecy about the role, but he told his family about the part anyway, and the next day his daughter discussed it publicly with a friend at her school.

Carter had never seen the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, and had only seen the sequel, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, because he was working at the time in a theater production with Anthony Daniels, who played C-3PO in the film. Following his appearance in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Carter was offered several alien roles or parts that involved heavy amounts of prosthetics. For example, he was cast in the role of Radu Molasar, a monster and warlord in the Michael Mann film &quot;The Keep&quot; (1983), as a direct result of his work in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Carter received letters and autograph requests from &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans for decades after the film&#x27;s release, and has made appearances at sci-fi and fantasy conventions. Carter was offered the opportunity to reprise the role of Bib Fortuna in the prequel &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, but he declined due to the rigors associated with the makeup application.

===Erik Bauersfeld===

The voice of Bib Fortuna in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was performed by Erik Bauersfeld, a radio dramatist who also voiced the alien character Admiral Ackbar in the film, and had unsuccessfully auditioned to voice Yoda in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. He was cast after &quot;Star Wars&quot; sound designer Ben Burtt approached him in 1983, while Bauersfeld was producing a radio drama with Lucasfilm sound designer Randy Thom and suggested he audition for the part of Ackbar. The recording session for Fortuna&#x27;s dialogue took about 30 minutes, and Bauersfeld made up the voice on the spot after looking at a photograph of Fortuna, without having any other information about the character. Since Fortuna spoke in the Huttese alien language, Bauersfeld had no idea what the character was saying when he recited the lines. He said of the process: &quot;Ben (Burtt) gave me a general idea and I just did it.&quot;

Bauersfeld did not receive an on-screen credit for his roles as Fortuna or Ackbar, and his association with the characters was unknown for years after the film was released. Michael Carter did not know another actor&#x27;s voice was used, as late as 2004 he believed it was his own voice, saying in an interview: &quot;It sounded like my voice.&quot; Eventually fans learned Bauersfeld played the parts and he began to receive multiple fan letters every week, which continued for the rest of his life. Bauersfeld said he appreciated the passion of fans and responded to every autograph request, but that he was not particularly knowledgeable about &quot;Star Wars&quot; himself; in a 2011 interview, he said he had not seen &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; since it first came out, still had not seen the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, and knew no details about Fortuna, asking the interviewer: &quot;He was the bad guy, wasn&#x27;t he?&quot;

===Matthew Wood===
Matthew Wood, a sound editor who has worked on multiple &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, portrayed Fortuna in the podrace scenes in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, which marked his first acting role. Wood has also provided the voices of General Grievous, Ello Asty, battle droids, and various other minor &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters. Wood was offered the part after George Lucas saw him in a doorway during a meeting and felt he looked right for the part. According to Wood, Lucas told him, &quot;You&#x27;re kind of skinny and creepy&quot; before offering him the part and sending him to wardrobe to be fitted with prosthetics.

Although in the scene Fortuna appears alongside Jabba and several other characters inside a private booth, Wood was alone when his scenes were filmed, and his footage was digitally combined with footage of the other characters later in post-production. Wood interacted with a light stand during filming, which was later replaced by a visual effect creating Jabba. The moment when Wood woke up a sleeping Jabba at the end of the podrace was a joke conceived by the motion picture visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic during the making of the film, which George Lucas loved. Wood reprised the role of Fortuna in the &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Gambit&quot; radio drama, recorded live at &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration VI in Orlando in August 2012. This time he provided the voice for the character, something he did not do in the film.

Wood reprised the role for the season two finale of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;.

In &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, Wood also portrays Bib Fortuna.

===Other portrayals===
Bib Fortuna was voiced by David Dukes in the radio dramitization of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; released in 1996 by Highbridge Audio. Alan Ruscoe, who portrayed the Jedi master Plo Koon and the Neimoidian captain Daultay Dofine in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, also portrayed Fortuna in a scene before the Galactic Senate, but it was ultimately cut from the final film.

==Cultural impact==
===Critical reception===
The name and first photo of Bib Fortuna were first revealed to the public in a &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; poster book published by Paradise Press in May 1983, the first of four such magazines released in advance of the film. In his 1983 review of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Desmond Ryan of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; cited Fortuna as one of the diverse types of alien species in the film that &quot;reaffirms the inventiveness and inspiration of Lucas and his legions of craftsmen and technicians&quot;. Ryan also said Fortuna &quot;looks like David Bowie with a large bratwurst sausage growing out of his ear&quot;.

Fortuna was ranked No. 25 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 50 best &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters, and was also included among &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s list of the best characters from the franchise. CNET writer Sam Stone called Fortuna &quot;one of the most memorable&quot; characters and alien races from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and described him as &quot;a fan-favorite character&quot;. &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot; writer Calum Waddell described Bib Fortuna as &quot;one of the standout supporting characters&quot; of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Scott Chernoff of &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot; said Michael Carter conveyed &quot;a touching vulnerability through his makeup and contact lenses, transforming what could have been a stock character into a sadly haunting figure&quot;.

Fortuna&#x27;s line &quot;De wanna wanga&quot;, which he speaks upon first meeting C-3PO and R2-D2 in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, has become a well-known line of &quot;Star Wars&quot; dialogue. Michael Carter has noted the character he portrayed became far more famous than the actor himself, joking: &quot;Bib Fortuna&#x27;s very famous; I&#x27;m hardly known within my own family.&quot; Daniel Mallory Ortberg, an author and editor who has written a &quot;Star Wars&quot; short story for the anthology book &quot;From a Certain Point of View&quot; (2017), has said &quot;Tales from Jabba&#x27;s Palace&quot; and reading the back story of Bib Fortuna and other characters was one of the first times the franchise strongly resonated with him. Comedian and actor Nick Swardson called Bib Fortuna one of his favorite &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters.

===Merchandise===
An action figure of Bib Fortuna was released by Kenner Products in 1983, coinciding with the release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. The toy was distributed in Europe by the company Palitoy. The action figure came with a miniature staff, and Fortuna wears a brown cloak in most versions, but five known prototypes exist in which he wears a white cloak, and they are considered among the most rare and valuable &quot;Star Wars&quot; toys. Several other Bib Fortuna products were released in 1983, including an eraser by Butterfly Originals, and a cookie by Pepperidge Farm. A Bib Fortuna toy was released in 1993 as part of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Bend-Ems line by JusToys, a collection of rubber figures that could be easily bent and twisted.

In 1996, Bib Fortuna was one of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters to receive its own Micro Machines mini-transforming playsets by Galoob. The toy line included miniature versions of the head of each character, which opened to reveal a small set from the film and a figurine of the character itself. The Fortuna playset was sold as part of a collection that also included an Imperial Scout Trooper and Figrin D&#x27;an, one of the Mos Eisley Cantina band members. Fortuna was also included in a Micro Machines playset of the planet Tatooine, which included both Jabba&#x27;s palace and the Great Pit of Carkoon. A Bib Fortuna action figure was released in 1997 as part of Kenner&#x27;s &quot;The Power Of The Force&quot; toy line, as part of the 20th anniversary of the release of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. The toy came with a small gun described as a &quot;black hold-out blaster&quot;. Also in 1997, Kenner released a two-pack of 12-inch figures of Fortuna and Luke Skywalker.

A ceramic mug of Fortuna was released in 1996 as part of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Classic Collectors Series Figural Mug line by the toy company Applause. Between 1997 and 1999, the Japanese company JAP Inc. created a series of large silver sculpted &quot;Star Wars&quot; rings from the various &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters, including Bib Fortuna. A Lego figurine of Bib Fortuna was created and released as part of multiple Lego &quot;Star Wars&quot; toy sets, including one of the front gate of Jabba&#x27;s palace released in 2003, and another of the interior of the palace released in 2012. Fortuna was one of 55 &quot;Star Wars&quot; skins released in November 2014 for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions of the video game &quot;Minecraft&quot;. A Funko Pop figurine of Fortuna was released in 2015. In 2017, the company Gentle Giant made a limited run of 750 miniature busts of Bib Fortuna, utilizing 3-D technology to create a 1:6-scale replica of the character.

An auction was held by the Dallas-based Heritage Auctions in August 2018 for a collection of 33 rare &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures that were expected to sell for about $360,000. The collection, which was sold by an anonymous collector from Dubai, included one of the five known original prototypes of Fortuna&#x27;s action figure, which alone was expected to sell for about $30,000. The 1980s master model of the Bib Fortuna toy by Kenner Products was sold at the Thornaby-based Vectis Auctions for in April 2019. It had an estimated value of before the auction, but sold for the highest amount of any of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prototypes auctioned, including an Emperor&#x27;s Royal Guard that sold for and Ewok named Logray that sold for . The models were saved by a Palitoy tooling manager who had kept them following the release of the figures. A rare encapsulated Bib Fortuna action figure included in an auction in Pennsylvania in November 2019 was expected to seek between $10,000 and $75,000.

In 2021 and 2023, Hasbro released two super-articulated action figures of Bib Fortuna based on his appearances in both Return of the Jedi and The Book of Boba Fett.

<doc id="657723" wikidata="Q6595083" url="?curid=657723" title="List of Privy Counsellors (1952–2022)">
<text>This is a list of members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom appointed during the reign of Elizabeth II, from 1952 to 2022. 

Eight Privy Counsellors resigned during Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s reign—John Profumo (1963) after misleading the House of Commons, and four others upon criminal conviction carrying a sentence of imprisonment, John Stonehouse (1976), Jonathan Aitken (1997) Chris Huhne (2013) and Denis MacShane (2013); one, Elliot Morley (2011) was expelled (the first expulsion since 1921). Additionally, Lord Prescott, the former Deputy Prime Minister, resigned in 2013 in protest over politicisation of handling of a press complaints charter being considered by the Council. Sir Seamus Treacy, a Lord Justice of Appeal in Northern Ireland, resigned shortly after his appointment in 2018. Percival Patterson resigned in 2022 noting a national consensus that Jamaica should become a republic.

<doc id="657728" wikidata="Q3034854" url="?curid=657728" title="Dominic LeBlanc">
<text>Dominic A. LeBlanc (born December 14, 1967) is a Canadian lawyer and politician who serves as Minister of Finance and Intergovernmental Affairs. He has been the minister of finance since December 2024 and minister of intergovernmental affairs since August 2020. A member of the Liberal Party, LeBlanc is the member of Parliament (MP) for Beauséjour since 2000. He has held a number of Cabinet portfolios throughout his tenure in government.

The son of former Governor General Roméo LeBlanc, he ran for the leadership of the Liberal Party in 2008 but dropped out of the race to endorse Michael Ignatieff, who was later acclaimed leader.

In the cabinet of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, LeBlanc served as the leader of the Government in the House of Commons from 2015 to 2016. He served as Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard from 2016 to 2018 and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Northern Affairs and Internal Trade from 2018 to 2019. He also served as President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada from 2018 to 2021 and began a second stint as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in 2020. After the 2021 federal election, LeBlanc remained as minister of intergovernmental affairs but additionally became minister of infrastructure and communities. In 2023, LeBlanc became Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs, gaining responsibility for public safety and democratic institutions while remaining minister of intergovernmental affairs. In December 2024, following the resignation of Chrystia Freeland, LeBlanc became minister of finance and he gave up the responsibility for public safety and democratic institutions while keeping intergovernmental affairs and the border security portfolio.

== Early life and education ==
LeBlanc was born in 1967, of Acadian descent, at the Ottawa Civic Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario, to Joslyn &quot;Lyn&quot; ( Carter) and Roméo LeBlanc, a former MP, senator and 25th governor general of Canada. At the time, his father was press secretary to Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson.

As a child, he baby-sat the children of then-prime minister Pierre Trudeau, including Justin Trudeau. He remained friends with Justin Trudeau and endorsed Trudeau&#x27;s candidacy for Liberal leader in 2012.

LeBlanc attended Lisgar Collegiate Institute in Ottawa for high school. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Toronto (Trinity College), a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of New Brunswick, and then attended Harvard Law School, where he obtained his Master of Laws degree. LeBlanc worked as a barrister and solicitor with Clark Drummie in Shediac and Moncton. From 1993 to 1996, LeBlanc was a Special Advisor to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien.

== Political career (1997–present) ==
LeBlanc is member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Beauséjour in New Brunswick.

LeBlanc first ran for election in that riding in 1997, losing to New Democratic Party candidate Angela Vautour. During that race there were accusations of political patronage as LeBlanc&#x27;s father was the sitting viceroy, and there was criticism that the governor general had a series of events planned in New Brunswick during the week that the election writs dropped.

In 2000 LeBlanc once again ran against Vautour, who had crossed the floor to join the Progressive Conservative party, and was elected. LeBlanc was re-elected in 2004 (where he faced Vautour for a third time), 2006, 2008, 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2021.

=== Chrétien and Martin governments ===
During the Liberal Party&#x27;s time in power LeBlanc served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, from January 13, 2003, to December 11, 2003, and was the chair of the Atlantic Caucus.

On July 10, 2004, he was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council for Canada and appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the leader of the Government in the House of Commons and deputy chief government whip. He has served on the Special Committee on Non-Medical Use of Drugs, and the Standing Committees on Fisheries and Oceans, Transport and Government Operations, National Defence and Veterans Affairs, and Public Accounts, Procedures and House Affairs, and International Trade.

=== In opposition ===
In January 2006, he was named Official Opposition critic for international trade and later that year he was co-chair of the 2006 Liberal Party leadership convention in Montreal. In January 2007, he was named by the Honourable Stéphane Dion, Vice Chair – Liberal Party of Canada Policy and Platform Committee and In October of that year, he was named Official Opposition critic for intergovernmental affairs. In January 2009, he was named by Michael Ignatieff as the critic for justice and attorney general. Before the return of Parliament in September 2010, Ignatieff shuffled his Shadow Cabinet and appointed LeBlanc as the Liberal critic for national defence. Following LeBlanc&#x27;s re-election in the 2011 federal election, interim Liberal leader Bob Rae appointed LeBlanc as the Liberal Party&#x27;s foreign affairs critic.

==== 2008 leadership bid ====

On October 27, 2008, LeBlanc was the first candidate to officially announce his intention to seek the leadership of the Liberal party to replace Stéphane Dion. Former leadership candidates Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae came forward shortly after LeBlanc&#x27;s announcement. His supporters included top staffers in the prime minister&#x27;s office under Jean Chrétien, such as his former chief of staff Percy Downe, and Tim Murphy, chief of staff under Paul Martin. Some senior organizers in Gerard Kennedy&#x27;s 2006 leadership bid were also with LeBlanc.

On December 8, 2008, LeBlanc announced he was dropping out of the leadership race because he felt a new leader needed to be in place as soon as possible and that he was throwing his support behind Ignatieff. The next day Rae dropped out of the race and Ignatieff was acclaimed leader when Dion stepped down.

==== 41st Canadian Parliament ====
LeBlanc retained his seat in the 2011 election, while the Liberals dropped down to third place in the House of Commons.

Following Ignatieff&#x27;s resignation as leader, LeBlanc was seen as a potential leadership candidate. LeBlanc did not say whether he was considering a bid but hoped to be part of the &quot;rebuilding and renewal&quot; of the party. Later, LeBlanc said that the next leader needs to commit 10 to 15 years of his or her life &quot;occupied exclusively&quot; with rebuilding the Liberal party and winning elections. On October 5, 2012, he announced he would not stand for the leadership and instead endorsed Justin Trudeau.

From 2012 to 2015, LeBlanc served as the Liberal opposition house leader.

=== Trudeau government ===
====42nd Canadian Parliament====

===== Leader of the Government in the House of Commons =====
On November 4, 2015, he was appointed the leader of the Government in the House of Commons in the present Cabinet, headed by Justin Trudeau.

As Government House Leader, LeBlanc was an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Board of Internal Economy, a committee of Members of Parliament chaired by the Speaker of the House of Commons who oversees the internal affairs of the House of Commons. He had previously been a member of committee as the Liberal Party’s House Leader while in opposition from 2012 to 2015, and continued to serve on the Board until October 26, 2023.

During his tenure as House Leader, LeBlanc introduced Bill C-22, which created the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, a committee composed of Members of Parliament and Senators equipped with top-secret security clearances and with a mandate to conduct oversight of the work of Canada’s national security and intelligence community. The committee is the first body of its kind in Canada, offering parliamentarians an unprecedented view into highly classified intelligence and activities conducted by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Global Affairs Canada. It produces classified and unclassified reports which are shared with the Prime Minister. The classified version of the report is subsequently tabled in Parliament and released publicly.

===== Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard =====
On May 31, 2016, upon the resignation of Hunter Tootoo from the Ministry, LeBlanc also became the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard. His father had previously held the equivalent position under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

As a Minister from an Atlantic province, LeBlanc was also one of the instigators behind the Atlantic Growth Strategy, an intergovernmental forum comprising all four Atlantic premiers and all Atlantic federal ministers launched on July 4, 2016. The Strategy’s goal is to attract newcomers and investment to Atlantic Canada by enabling collaboration between the federal government and Atlantic provinces on immigration, innovation, clean technology, trade and investment, and infrastructure.

On August 19, 2016, LeBlanc was replaced as leader of the Government in the House of Commons by Bardish Chagger. He retained the post of Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard. During his tenure as Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, LeBlanc modernized the &quot;Fisheries Act,&quot; strengthening the provisions contained in the legislation regarding the protection of fish stocks and fish habitat. He also introduced legislation amending the &quot;Oceans Act&quot; and the &quot;Canada Petroleum Resources Act&quot; to establish a national network of Marine Protected Areas, a novel type of conservation measure in Canada. Since then, 14 &quot;Oceans Act&quot; Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been established across Canada, comprising over 350,000 km² or roughly 6% of Canada’s marine and coastal areas, contributing to Canada’s goal of protecting 30% of its marine areas by 2030, in accordance with its international commitments.

LeBlanc’s tenure was also marked by heightened concerns regarding the entanglement of North Atlantic Right Whales, an endangered species, in fishing gear, leading to the death of several cetaceans. In response, LeBlanc engaged with industry groups, Indigenous communities and United States fishing authorities to develop new fishing gear and implement seasonal restrictions to maritime traffic to reduce the risk of entanglement and collisions.

On September 12, 2018, the ethics commissioner, Mario Dion found LeBlanc broke conflict of interest rules when he awarded a lucrative Arctic surf clam licence to a company linked to his wife&#x27;s cousin in February 2018.

===== Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Northern Affairs and Internal Trade =====
On July 18, 2018, LeBlanc was shuffled from Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard to Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Northern Affairs and Internal Trade, a combination of two positions, Intergovernmental Affairs and Youth, and Northern Affairs. He also became vice-chair of the Cabinet Committee on Agenda, Results and Communications, which is manages the government’s overall strategic agenda and priority setting, and tracks implementation, which is chaired by the Prime Minister.

As Minister of Northern Affairs, LeBlanc shepherded legislation amending &quot;the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act&quot; to give Indigenous communities in the Northwest Territories and the surrounding region a greater say in the management of resource development projects.

On the internal trade front, LeBlanc advanced several initiatives to make it easier to trade within Canada. He pushed provinces and territories to standardize provincial regulations in several key industries, including construction, food and drink, and manufacturing, reducing administrative burdens and making it easier for businesses to do business in other provinces. In December 2018, at a First Ministers’ Meeting in Montréal, LeBlanc led a discussion with Premiers on ways to strengthen internal trade in Canada.

On April 26, 2019, LeBlanc announced he would be stepping back from cabinet as he sought treatment for cancer.

====43rd Canadian Parliament====

===== President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada =====
On November 20, 2019, LeBlanc returned to Cabinet as President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, a position with reduced responsibilities. His former role as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Northern Affairs and Internal Trade, was split between the minister of northern affairs, and the minister of intergovernmental affairs.

After the resignation of Bill Morneau as Minister of Finance, LeBlanc again became Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs after his successor, Chrystia Freeland, took the role of Minister of Finance in a cabinet shuffle on August 18, 2020. He retained his position as President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

====44th Canadian Parliament====
=====Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Infrastructure and Communities=====

On October 26, 2021, LeBlanc was appointed Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Infrastructure and Communities, as well as chair of the Sub-Committee on Intergovernmental Coordination, which takes an intergovernmental lens to the key issues before the government. He continued to chair the Cabinet Committee on Operations and the Sub-Committee on the Federal Response to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).

During his tenure, he oversaw the allocation of billions of dollars of investment through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP) and reached deals with provinces and territories to accelerate the allocation of their respective ICIP funding envelopes ahead of the planned deadline. This was meant to boost public investment in job-creating projects during a time of economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Throughout this time, LeBlanc also retained responsibilities for several files he was previously assigned, including Democratic Institutions and Internal Trade.

In his role as Minister responsible for Democratic Institutions, he oversaw the adoption of the &quot;Preserving Provincial Representation in the House of Commons Act&quot; in 2022, which amended the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; to provide that a province may not have fewer Members of Parliament than it had during the 43rd Parliament. This was in response to riding boundary adjustments made following the 2021 decennial census, which would otherwise have seen Quebec lose a seat in the House of Commons.

In his role as Minister responsible for Internal Trade, in December 2022, he launched the Federal Action Plan to Strengthen Internal Trade, which led to the removal and narrowing of one third of all federal exceptions in the 2017 Canadian Free Trade Agreement. In November 2024, LeBlanc accompanied Prime Minister Trudeau for his meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.

=====Minister of Finance and Intergovernmental Affairs=====
On December 16, 2024, he was sworn in as the minister of finance following the surprise resignation of former finance minister and deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland. LeBlanc was considered as a possible candidate in the 2025 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, upon the resignation of Trudeau. He declined to run in the election, citing the need to focus on potential tariffs from the incoming second Trump administration.

== Personal life ==
In 2003, he married Jolène Richard, a former Moncton lawyer who became a judge on the Provincial Court of New Brunswick in 2008, and eventually became a chief judge. She is the daughter of Guy A. Richard, who served as Chief Justice of the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of New Brunswick. He has an adult stepson.

==== Cancer treatment ====
In December 2017, he announced that he had been diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and would begin chemotherapy immediately while continuing to serve in his parliamentary roles. However, following a period of remission, his cancer took a turn for the worse. On April 26, 2019, LeBlanc announced he would be stepping back from cabinet as he sought treatment.

In September 2019, LeBlanc underwent a stem cell transplant at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montréal, Québec to cure his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, an extremely rare form of cancer. Following initial chemotherapy treatments at the CHU Dr. Georges L. Dumont Hospital in Moncton, New Brunswick, his doctors referred him to specialists at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital due to the severity and aggressiveness of his cancer. He spent 56 nights, spanning most of the 2019 federal election campaign, in an isolation room at Maisonneuve-Rosemont.

He was sworn in as President of the Queen’s Privy Council in November 2019, two weeks after being discharged from the hospital, and returned to the House of Commons in late January 2020. 

LeBlanc has talked publicly about his experience with cancer and his stem cell transplant. After the regular two-years non-contact time between donor and patient, in September 2022, he met with his stem cell donor, German national Jonathan Kehl. The meeting between the two was the subject of significant attention in Canadian media. LeBlanc also travelled to Germany to visit Kehl’s family in May 2023.

<doc id="657730" wikidata="Q1759833" url="?curid=657730" title="TI-BASIC">
<text>TI-BASIC is the official name of a BASIC-like language built into Texas Instruments&#x27; graphing calculators.
TI-BASIC is a language family of three different and incompatible versions, released on different products:
* TI-BASIC 83 (on Z80 processor) for TI-83 series, TI-84 Plus series
* TI-BASIC 89 (on 68k processor) for TI-89 series, TI-92 series, Voyage 200
* TI-BASIC Nspire (on ARM processor) for TI-Nspire and TI-Nspire CAS
TI rarely refers to the language by name, but the name TI-BASIC has been used in some developer documentation.

For many applications, it is the most convenient way to program any TI calculator, since the capability to write programs in TI-BASIC is built-in. Assembly language (often referred to as &quot;asm&quot;) can also be used, and C compilers exist for translation into assembly: TIGCC for Motorola 68000 (68k) based calculators, and SDCC for Zilog Z80 based calculators. However, both of them are cross-compilers, not allowing on-calculator programming. TI-BASIC is considerably slower than the assembly language (because it has to be interpreted), making it better suited to writing programs to quickly solve math problems or perform repetitive tasks, rather than programming games or graphics-intensive applications. Some math instruction books even provide programs in TI-BASIC (usually for the widespread variant used by the TI-82/83/84 series).

Although it is somewhat minimalist compared to programming languages used on computers, TI-BASIC is nonetheless an important factor in the programming community. Because TI graphing calculators are required for advanced mathematics classes in many high schools and universities, TI-BASIC often provides the first glimpse many students have into the world of programming.
== Syntax ==
The syntax of all versions of TI-BASIC are somewhat different from typical BASIC implementations. The language itself has some basic structured programming capabilities, but makes limited to no use of or allowance for white space or indentation. It is also dependent on a somewhat non-standard character set, with specific characters for assignment (the right &quot;STO&quot; arrow, not readily available in most character sets), square and cube roots, and other mathematical symbols, as well as tokenized entry and storage for keywords. All statements begin with a colon, which also functions as a statement separator within lines. On the TI-83/84 models, closing parentheses, brackets, braces, and quotes can optionally be omitted at the end of a line or before the STO token in order to save space, although sometimes they are better left on. For example, on TI 83/84 models the for loop function runs much slower without closing parentheses in certain circumstances.

Expressions use infix notation, with standard operator precedence. Many statements demand arguments in parentheses, similar to the syntax used for mathematical functions. The syntax for assignment (copying of data into a variable) is unusual with respect to most conventional programming languages for computers; rather than using a BASIC-like let statement with an equal sign, or an algol-like codice_1 operator, TI-BASIC uses a right-arrow codice_2 operator with the syntax: &quot;source → destination&quot;. This is similar to several Japanese calculators, such as from Casio, Canon and Sharp, that have often employed a similar syntax, ever since the first mass market Japanese alphanumerical calculators appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

=== Control flow ===
Control flow statements include if-then-else blocks, for loops, while loops, and repeat loops, though no switch statements. 
The main control flow statements are:

Unusual for a high level language, TI-BASIC implementations include IS&gt; (Increment and Skip if Greater Than) and DS&lt; (Decrement and Skip if Less Than) statements, constructs generally associated with assembly languages. Sections of programs can be labeled; however, particularly on the Z80 models, the labels function as destinations for Goto statements or codice_3 functions rather than as program or block labels.

Availability of functions and subroutines depends on the implementation; the versions available on the TI-82-descended calculators do not even support a GOSUB-like function, though it is possible to call programs from within each other and share variables between programs. TI-89/92-based designs can have access to shared functions, essentially programs capable of returning a value.

=== Data types ===
TI-BASIC is a strongly and dynamically typed language. Available data types differ considerably between the 68k and Z80 versions. It is not possible to create user-defined data types without using a library written in assembly. Lists are often used as a replacement for structs.

==== TI-83/84 (Z80) ====
* Numerical variables, including codice_4 - codice_5 and codice_6 (theta). These allow real numbers or complex numbers (implemented as pairs of reals) to be stored in floating point format. Values may range from 1-99 to 199 with 14 digits of accuracy, although only 10 digits are usually displayed to users. The limit of 27 variables, however, may be expanded through the use of lists, matrices, and manipulation of integer notation. A list or matrix can be used to contain unique real variables which can be individually referenced. Integers can be concatenated into a single real variable by delineating them as the integer and decimal halves of a real number; each half is then accessed independently via the iPart and fPart commands. Variables with binary values can be stored as a single integer through conversion between base 2 and base 10.
* Strings, including codice_7 - codice_8. These may store any number of characters or even function names, as long as there is available memory. They can be evaluated as an expression with the codice_9 function, which is found in the catalog.
* Lists, including codice_10 - codice_10, with the ability to create additional ones. These are essentially one-dimensional arrays used to store a real or complex number into each of their elements. The dimension of a list, its number of elements, may range from 1 to 999, although available memory may be a limiting factor. When a list&#x27;s dimension is set lower than it had been, elements at the end are cut off. When set higher, extra elements at the end are filled with zeros. Dimensions are set by storing a valid number into the codice_12 of the list name. The default lists are named L–L, but custom lists can be created. This is done by setting dimension of a list referenced with the token in the codice_13, followed by a name ranging from 1 to 5 characters that begins with an uppercase letter codice_4 - codice_5 and codice_6. Individual elements of lists can be accessed by placing the element number in parentheses after the list name.
* Matrices, including codice_17 - codice_18. Their elements are subject to the same restrictions as lists. Their dimensions may be defined up to 99x99 elements, although, again, available memory will limit this. It is not possible to create user-defined matrices, so only the ten built in ones may be utilized.
* Equation variables, including codice_19 - codice_19, codice_21 - codice_21, and codice_23, codice_24, codice_25. These are essentially strings which store equations. They are evaluated to return a value when used in an expression or program. Specific values, (constant, C) can be plugged in for the independent variable (X) by following the equation name (dependent, Y) by the constant value in parentheses. In the example below, &quot;(4)&quot; is used (for no particular reason). (codice_19(4) would return the value of codice_19 at X=4)

Data types that cannot be directly manipulated include:
* Pictures (codice_28 - codice_29)
* Background (codice_30 - codice_31)
* Programs (codice_32)
* Graph databases (codice_33 - codice_34)
* Color (codice_35, codice_36..., codice_37) (15 colors in total)

==== TI-89 (68k) ====
* Integers, which can store a large amount of data. The 68k calculators can store very large numbers, as high as formula_1, with perfect accuracy.
* Real numbers, using decimal floating point. These store up to 14 significant digits depending on the calculator model.
* Complex numbers, implemented as pairs of reals.
* Strings
* Lists, which are one-dimensional linked lists which support element-wise operations. On the 68k calculators, elements can be integers, reals, complex numbers, strings or expressions.
* Matrices, with elements subject to the same restrictions in lists
* Symbolic expressions, unique to the 68k series.

Data types that cannot be directly manipulated (typing only their name on a line would result in an error) include:
* Pictures
* Data
* Programs
* Functions

=== Variables ===
Flexibility in the use of variables varies widely by the calculator model. For example, on the TI-84 Plus, all English language letters as well as theta (Θ) are available.

==== TI-83/84 (Z80) ====
On the TI-83/84, the programmer can create lists whose names are up to five characters. All other data types are limited, such as the 27 real or complex variables, and a number of predefined variable names of other types (e.g., matrices have to be one of the ten variables codice_17-codice_18). On the TI-83/84 certain variables such as codice_40 and the finance variables have fixed addresses in RAM, making them much faster to access than the 27 letter variables. codice_40 acts as a special variable containing the result of the last evaluated code. A line with just a variable will still be evaluated and its contents stored in codice_40 as a result. Because codice_40 is reevaluated so frequently it most often is used to store very temporary calculations or to hold values that would otherwise be slow to access such as items from a list. All variables are global.

==== TI-89 (68k) ====
In contrast, 68k calculators allow all variable names to have up to eight alphanumeric characters, including Greek. Furthermore, variables can be grouped into &quot;folders&quot;, or made local to a program by declaring them with the codice_44 statement.

=== Comments ===
==== TI-83/84 (Z80) ====
Z80 programmers often start lines with &quot; (double quotation mark) to denote a comment. Lines starting with &quot; are actually executed changing the codice_40 variable, but this does not affect anything other than performance unless codice_40 is read immediately afterwards.

==== TI-89 (68k) ====
The 68k calculators allow programs to include single-line comments, using © as a comment symbol. If a comment appears as the first line after the &quot;Prgm&quot; statement, it is displayed in the status bar when the program is selected in the catalog; such comments are often used to document the names or types of parameters. The 68k interpreter has a built in feature to store the number of space characters at the beginning of a line, this allows indentation.

=== Functions ===
==== TI-83/84 (Z80) ====
The Z80 version of TI-BASIC makes explicit &quot;functions&quot; like those in 68k impossible. However, all variables are global so functions can be emulated by setting variables, similar to arguments, before calling another program. Return values do not exist; the codice_47 statement stops the current program and continues where the program was called.

==== TI-89 (68k) ====
The 68k version of TI-BASIC allows creating user-defined functions. Functions have the same syntax as programs except that they use the codice_48...codice_49 keywords instead of codice_50...codice_51, and that they are not allowed to use instructions that perform I/O, modify non-local variables, nor call programs. However, functions can still be non-pure because they can call built-in functions such as codice_52, codice_53, or codice_54. All functions have a return value, which in the absence of an explicit codice_47 statement is the last expression evaluated.

=== Third-party language extensions ===
Third-party applications, in chronological order Omnicalc, xLIB, Celtic, and Doors CS, have overloaded TI-BASIC functions on the Z80 calculators to provide additional language functionality. The third-party libraries overload the codice_56, codice_57, codice_58 and codice_59 functions, which are handled and interpreted by their respective applications. Among the extra functions are fast shape-drawing routines, sprite and tilemap tools, program and VAT modification and access abilities, GUI construction features, and much more, most of which are ordinarily restricted to use by assembly programmers. All of the functions require that an application like Doors CS 7.0 be present on the user&#x27;s calculator, sometimes considered a detraction to the use of the libraries.

== Examples ==

=== Hello world ===
The following programs, when executed, will display the phrase &quot;codice_60&quot;.

==== TI-83/84 (Z80 Series) ====
==== TI-89 (68k Series) ====
(P.S. this code can be shortened down to just the Disp function, like in the TI-83/84, and the hellowld, prgm, and endprgm are auto-generated.)

==== TI-Nspire ====
==== TI-Nspire CX ====
=== Lists and loops ===

==== TI-83/84 (Z80 Series) ====
==== TI-89 (68k Series) ====
Lists have many possible names, this allows for many programs to manipulate many lists without overriding previous data. Lists on the TI-82 cannot have custom names (L1 through L6 are preprogrammed). The TI-85 and TI-86 do not have the ability to handle a variable name with subscripts. The TI-81 is completely unable to handle lists. Lists can be used by the numerous built-in TI-BASIC functions for calculating statistics, including various regression analyses and more. These can be called inside of programs, however they still show the info while pausing execution and they cannot store specific results into variables.

=== Recursion ===
Recursion is possible. A program can be called from within itself or from within another program.

==== TI-83/84 (Z80 Series) ====
The example below is used to compute factorials. In order for it to work, codice_61 is the parameter of the factorial function and codice_4 must equal 1.

==== TI-89 (68k Series) ====

=== Functions ===
The 68k series makes a distinction between programs and functions. Functions are just like programs except that they do not allow statements that perform I/O, including modifying non-local variables, and they return a value, which in the absence of an explicit codice_47 statement is the last expression evaluated.

== Editors and Tools ==
The growth of the hobbyist graphing calculator community in the 1990s brought with it sharing and collaboration, including the need to share TI-BASIC code on mailing lists and discussion forums. At first, this was done by typing out the TI-BASIC code from a calculator screen into a computer by hand, or conversely, entering programs manually into calculators. TI-BASIC programs are stored in a tokenized format, they cannot be edited using standard computer text editors, so as the calculator programming community matured, a need for an automated converter arose. The format for computer-stored TI-BASIC programs generated by Texas Instruments&#x27; TI-GraphLink application was eventually decoded, and third-party tools were created to manipulate these files. TI created a BASIC editor that they included in certain releases of the TI-GraphLink linking program, but it has not gained widespread usage. In particular, it used a custom character set that did not display properly when copied and pasted to fora.

In 2005, Joe Penna created OptiBASIC, a translator tool to convert text from the TI-GraphLink editor into standard Unicode. The project soon expanded to include a regex-based TI-BASIC optimizer. Independently, Christopher &quot;Kerm Martian&quot; Mitchell of Cemetech began creating an online converter to extract plain-text (and later HTML and BBCode-formatted) contents from tokenized TI-BASIC programs, which expanded to include an online program editor, exporter, and TI-83 Plus emulator. The SourceCoder project absorbed OptiBASIC at the end of 2005. The only other major TI-BASIC editor currently in use is TokenIDE (or &quot;Tokens&quot;), created by Shaun &quot;Merthsoft&quot; McFall. An offline editor, Tokens can import, edit, and export TI-BASIC programs, includes tools to track program size and correctness, and offers ancillary features such as a sprite/image editor. Built around token definitions stored in XML files, it is intended to be extensible to work with any user-specified token mapping.

Programmes on the NSprire series as well as TI 92 plus and Voyage 200 calculators can be transferred and saved in flat clear text (Ansi/Ascii/ISO 8859-*) format and there are several IDEs for TI calculator programming. A series of TextPad syntax definitions, code snippets, and charts are available for the TI calculators, and the syntax definitions have also been converted to the format used by the Zeus editor. The clear text format is also used for the Lua interpreter on the calculator.

An independent project exists for developing a PC-side interpreter for the TI89-92-Voyage 200 variant of TI Basic that would allow programmes for the calculator to be run directly as well as combined programmes of other languages which call this interpreter. The interpreter uses standard input, output, error and specifiable log and configuration files in console mode under Windows, and a second programme to replicate the graphics used on the calculator would be related to it in the same way as the Tk tools which are integrated with Tcl, Perl, Rexx, C and other languages. A related project for developing a Tk kind of tool for use by VBScript is the source of this tool. A third tool which integrates the PC-side TI Basic with spreadsheet and database programmes via VBA and WSH engines is also envisioned. This project also involves a calculator-side Unix-style shell and Rexx and Perl interpreters, a Fortran 77 interpreter, as well as converters to go back and forth amongst the various Casio, HP, Sharp, and Texas Instruments calculator programming languages and to and from those and various scripting languages.

<text>Rio Grande Credit Union Field at Isotopes Park, previously known only as Isotopes Park, is a minor league baseball stadium located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and is the home field of the Albuquerque Isotopes of the Pacific Coast League, the Triple-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies and New Mexico United, a professional soccer team in the USL Championship division that began play in 2019. The facility was also previously used by the University of New Mexico baseball program.

==History==
In 2000, Bob Lozinak, then-owner of the Albuquerque Dukes, the Triple-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers, sold the team to a Portland, Oregon-based group, who moved the team to Portland as the Beavers. The Dukes had played in Albuquerque for almost 40 years. Their stadium, Albuquerque Sports Stadium, was the second oldest in the league and was in disrepair.

Finding another owner and team was not difficult. The Pacific Coast League had teams in Canada that they wanted to relocate. In 2001, a group headed by Tampa businessman Ken Young bought the Calgary Cannons intending to move it to Albuquerque, contingent on building a park. However, then-Mayor Jim Baca was unable to overcome opposition from a city council reluctant to spend city money on the project. Debate centered on whether to renovate the old Albuquerque Sports Stadium as a baseball-only park or build a brand new park downtown. Mayor Baca put the issue to a vote and the voters easily approved the $25 million needed to finance the project.

As it turned out, the renovation of Albuquerque Sports Stadium turned into construction of a completely new facility. Almost nothing of the old Albuquerque Sports Stadium remains, apart from the playing field. However, the new park retains its predecessor&#x27;s general structure, as well as its dimensions and the system connecting the dugout to the clubhouse. The new stadium was also intended to retain the old facility&#x27;s well-known &quot;drive-in&quot; terrace, where fans could sit in their cars and watch the game for free. However, Isotopes management scrapped those plans due to security concerns and instead converted it into a play area for children. Like its predecessor, it is known as a hitter&#x27;s park, due to the high altitude and dry air, but changes in the field were made to create more of a windscreen which allows the ball-protected lift. The fences were also brought in slightly.

Isotopes Park was the home of the 2007 Triple-A All-Star Game, with the International League defeating the Pacific Coast League, 7–5. The game was viewed by 12,367 in attendance; the game was also broadcast on ESPN2 and on radio. Albuquerque&#x27;s Valentino Pascucci was selected as the PCL MVP. Former Isotope Rob Stratton won the Home Run Derby.

On June 23, 2009, a single-game attendance record (since broken) was set when fans saw Manny Ramirez make a rehab start after serving a 50-game suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs. The Isotopes defeated the Nashville Sounds 1–0.

On September 20, 2011, Isotopes Park was host to the 2011 Triple-A National Championship Game between the champions of the Pacific Coast League and the International League. The game featured the Columbus Clippers defeating the Omaha Storm Chasers, 8–3, in front of 9,569 fans.

The Isotopes set a single-game attendance record in 2018 when 16,975 fans attended a game on Cinco de Mayo as part of minor league baseball&#x27;s &quot;Copa de la Diversión&quot; promotion, in which the Isotopes played as the Mariachis de Nuevo México.

In 2020, the Isotopes entered into a corporate naming rights agreement with Rio Grande Credit Union to rebrand the facility as Rio Grande Credit Union Field at Isotopes Park.

===University of New Mexico===
In 2012, New Mexico ranked 38th among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 1,618 per home game.

===Soccer===

New Mexico United, an expansion team playing in the USL Championship, began play at Isotopes Park on March 9, 2019. The inaugural match, which finished as a 1–1 draw against Fresno FC, was attended by 12,896 fans. The record attendance for a match is 15,247, set on August 17, 2019 against Los Angeles Galaxy II.

==Features==
The stadium has a seating capacity of 13,279, with 11,154 fixed seats. There are 661 club seats and 30 suites at the ballpark. The field used to feature a hill in center field, similar to the one formerly in the Houston Astros&#x27; stadium, Minute Maid Park, but it was removed after the 2022 season, due to concerns for player safety.

The stadium has a large open breezeway above the primary seating area with a view of the playing field, which contains most of the park&#x27;s services, such as restrooms, most of the food concessions, activities, and a souvenir store behind home plate. Behind the infield is the main structure of the stadium, which contains suites, offices, and the press box. An upper seating deck is attached to the structure, which overhangs the open breezeway. Beyond right field is a berm where fans can watch the game. Above the berm is a play area for children. Beyond left field is the scoreboard as well as a picnic shelter which can be reserved for groups.

The elevation of the playing field exceeds above sea level and warm summer air also give the balls great lift.

Statues of Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Bart Simpson of the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; are located on the concourse. The 2001 episode &quot;Hungry, Hungry Homer&quot;, in which the fictional Springfield Isotopes attempted a move to Albuquerque, was the inspiration for the real-life team&#x27;s name.

<doc id="657750" wikidata="Q390149" url="?curid=657750" title="Against Me! Is Reinventing Axl Rose">
<text>Against Me! Is Reinventing Axl Rose (often shortened to Reinventing Axl Rose) is the debut album by the American punk rock band Against Me!, released on March 5, 2002 under No Idea Records. It was the group&#x27;s first release as a full band with electric guitars, bass guitar, and drums. The album was produced by Rob McGregor, who would also produce the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Against Me! as the Eternal Cowboy&quot; (2003). The album&#x27;s title references Guns N&#x27; Roses singer Axl Rose, illustrated on the cover.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Against Me! Is Reinventing Axl Rose&quot; was recorded in four sessions. Ten of the album&#x27;s eleven songs were recorded on December 21 and 28, 2001, and January 12, 2002 at Goldentone Studios in Gainesville by Rob McGregor. &quot;8 Full Hours of Sleep&quot; came from an earlier recording session on July 23, 2001 on which Jordan Kleeman played the Moog synthesizer.

Five of the album&#x27;s songs had previously been released on the band&#x27;s EPs but were re-recorded for the album: &quot;Walking Is Still Honest&quot; had appeared on &quot;Against Me!&quot; (2000) and &quot;I Still Love You Julie&quot; had appeared on &quot;Crime as Forgiven By Against Me!&quot; (2001), both recorded when the band consisted of only singer/guitarist Laura Jane Grace and drummer Kevin Mahon. &quot;Jordan&#x27;s First Choice&quot;, &quot;Those Anarcho Punks Are Mysterious...&quot;, and &quot;Pints of Guinness Make You Strong&quot; had appeared on &quot;Against Me!&quot; as acoustic versions recorded by Grace and bassist Dustin Fridkin. By the time of the album&#x27;s recording Against Me! consisted of Grace, Fridkin, drummer Warren Oakes, and guitarist James Bowman, and the band re-recorded these five songs with full electric instrumentation.

Several guest singers provided backing vocals for &quot;We Laugh at Danger (And Break All the Rules)&quot; including Sam Jones, Todd &quot;Bitchin, Ryan and Patrick Quinney, Adam Volk, Rose O&#x27;Hara, and Jordan Kleeman. Sam Jones also sang backing vocals on &quot;Pints of Guinness Make You Strong&quot; and &quot;Jordan&#x27;s 1st Choice&quot;. &quot;Baby, I&#x27;m an Anarchist!&quot; dates back to one of Grace&#x27;s previous bands:
&quot;Baby, I&#x27;m an Anarchist!&quot; was written by Laura Jane Grace, Cassidy Rist, and Rob Augman for a band that never happened, but was a really good idea. Although we played it live 2 or 3 times, it was never recorded. Cassidy was kind enough to come in and sing on this song; she was drunk. It was 11am.
Remarking on the album&#x27;s themes in 2008, Grace said: &quot;you get to an age where you get discouraged with dreams like [playing in a band] and you&#x27;re told you&#x27;re never going to be able to do anything like that, and you start to feel like there&#x27;s a closed door, and when I started to feel that way, I went ahead and started doing my own thing. We made our own way and that was kind of just what the title of the album and a lot of the album was about, really, was just doing it yourself and not taking &#x27;no&#x27; for an answer, and reclaiming your dreams.&quot;

At The Fest in October 2017, Against Me! played the album live in its entirety, with the band&#x27;s original bassist Dustin Fridkin playing with the band. Most of the songs have been regularly played in concert by the band since the release of &quot;Axl&quot;, with the exception of &quot;The Politics of Starving&quot;, &quot;Jordan&#x27;s First Choice&quot; and &quot;Scream It Until You&#x27;re Coughing Up Blood (Jamaican Me Crazy)&quot;, which prior to October 2017 were last played live in concert by Against Me! or Laura Jane Grace in May 2003, November 2008 and May 2003 respectively.

==Album title==
Grace stated the album name was a &quot;kill your idols&quot; proclamation: &quot;Guns N&#x27; Roses were my favorite band when I was a kid. The title was meant as a tribute in a way. It was also about destroying your heroes.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Critic Corey Apar of AllMusic gave &quot;Against Me! Is Reinventing Axl Rose&quot; four and a half out of five stars, calling it &quot;an impressive debut that manages to combine fist-in-the-air singalong choruses, lagered-up rhythms, and urgent drumbeats with the underground, raw intensity these punks are known for live&quot; and &quot;a true classic that brings listeners right into the dirty basements and dive bars that birthed the band — and serves as the foundation to where they would head next.&quot; &quot;Exclaim!&quot; gave a positive review, calling the album a &quot;missing link between the Clash and Bob Dylan&quot;.

<doc id="657756" wikidata="Q5106213" url="?curid=657756" title="Chris Cole (politician)">
<text>Chris Cole (born January 17, 1964, in Huntersville, North Carolina) is a Libertarian Party activist in North Carolina. He has run unsuccessfully for a number of local, state, and federal offices. In 2008, it was thought that his candidacy might act as a spoiler in what was expected to be a close U.S. Senate race.

==Early political career==
In 1996, Cole unsuccessfully ran as a Libertarian for a seat in the North Carolina General Assembly against Jim Black in House District 36.

In 2001, Cole sought election to the District 4 seat on the Charlotte City Council, challenging incumbent Malcolm Graham. Graham was re-elected, with 6,976 votes to Cole&#x27;s 762.

In 2002, Cole ran for the U.S. Congress in North Carolina&#x27;s 9th congressional district. In that race, Republican Sue Myrick was re-elected with 72% of the vote to Democrat Ed McGuire&#x27;s 26%. Cole received 3,374 votes, or 2%.

Cole again ran for the City Council in 2003, this time for one of four at-large seats; the other candidates were three Democrats and four Republicans, including one incumbent from each of the two major parties. Two Republicans and two Democrats, including both incumbents, won the four seats; Cole received 5,533 votes, less than any other candidate. The four winners received from 36,743 to 41,661 votes; after Cole, the worst-performing candidate received 24,468.

Cole was the Libertarian candidate for lieutenant governor in the 2004 election. Incumbent Democrat Beverly Perdue won re-election with 56% of the vote to Republican Jim Snyder&#x27;s 43%. Cole received 56,368 votes, or 2%.

==2008 Senate race==
In 2008, Cole ran for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Elizabeth Dole. When he entered the race, the Libertarian Party was not officially recognized by the state; rather than going through a primary, he had to secure signatures on a petition. One of his goals in running, he said, was to generate support for Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr and gubernatorial candidate Mike Munger; if either won more than 2% of the vote, the party would retain its recognition and would not need to gather signatures for the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Cole&#x27;s platform included ending the Iraq War and abolishing the personal income tax. While Dole and Democratic challenger Kay Hagan insisted on the need for border security to deal with illegal immigration, Cole ascribed the problem to the minimum-wage law and other labor restrictions.

The race between Dole and Hagan was expected to be close, and it was suggested that Cole might influence the outcome by taking a small but significant share of votes from one of the major-party candidates. An August poll conducted by Public Policy Polling showed 42% of respondents supporting Hagan to 39% for Dole; Cole was the choice of 5%. Another survey indicated that Cole was drawing support of 6–7%. In late October, a new Public Policy Polling survey showed Hagan leading Dole 48–45%, with Cole chosen by 4%. According to Cole, his candidacy would draw support from both the Republican and the Democrat, although slightly more from the former: fiscal conservatives dissatisfied with the Bush administration would choose him over Dole, while voters alienated by Hagan&#x27;s opposition to same-sex marriage and by what Cole called her &quot;immigrant-bashing&quot; might transfer their support to him.

When the election was held, the race proved much less close than expected. Hagan defeated Dole with 53% of the vote to 44%; Cole received 133,430 votes, or 3%.

==After 2008==

In 2016, Cole ran as a Libertarian for the 41st District seat in the North Carolina Senate. He challenged incumbent Jeff Tarte, a Republican who had held the seat since 2012. Tarte won the election, with 55,155 votes, or 55% of the total; Democrat Jonathan Hudson received 41,214 votes, or 41%; and Cole received 4,894 votes, or 5%.

<doc id="657764" wikidata="Q609091" url="?curid=657764" title="Uncle Buck">
<text>Uncle Buck is a 1989 American comedy film written and directed by John Hughes. It stars John Candy and Amy Madigan with Jean Louisa Kelly, Laurie Metcalf, Jay Underwood, Macaulay Culkin, Gaby Hoffmann, Elaine Bromka, and Garrett M. Brown appearing in supporting roles. The film tells the story of a bachelor who babysits his brother&#x27;s rebellious teenage daughter and her younger brother and sister while the parents are away. It was released in theatres by Universal Pictures on August 16, 1989, and grossed $79.2 million.

==Plot==

Bob and Cindy Russell have recently moved from Indianapolis with their three children, 15-year-old Tia, 8-year-old Miles, and 6-year-old Maizy, to the Chicago suburbs. Resentful about the move, Tia&#x27;s relationship with her mother is fraught. After learning that Cindy&#x27;s father has had a heart attack, Bob and Cindy are reluctantly forced to leave the children in the care of Bob&#x27;s brother, Buck, a heavy drinker and smoker who makes a living by betting on rigged horse races. His long-term girlfriend, Chanice, desires to get married and start a family, while Buck wants to retain his freedom and lack of responsibility; Chanice warns him that he will eventually end up alone. 

Buck quickly befriends Miles and Maizy, whom he has never met, but Tia is hostile and rebellious towards him. He settles into the Russell home and learns that he has been cropped out of his brother&#x27;s wedding photos. Over the next several days, Buck takes the children bowling, ejects a drunken party clown from Miles&#x27; birthday party, defends Maizy from her school&#x27;s strict assistant principal, and washes laundry in the kitchen sink because he cannot operate the washing machine. When Buck meets Tia&#x27;s obnoxious boyfriend, Bug, he warns her that Bug is only interested in her for sex and repeatedly thwarts her plans to sneak out with him. In retaliation, Tia convinces Chanice that Buck is cheating on her with a neighbor, Marcy. When Chanice walks in on Marcy dancing with Buck, she ends their relationship. Buck laments that people used to envy his carefree life, but he realizes that lifestyle is no longer admirable.

After Tia sneaks out to a party, Buck decides to look for her instead of attending a horse race that would provide him with enough money for the entire year, and begs Chanice to look after Miles and Maizy. At the party, Buck forces open the door to a bedroom where he thinks Bug is taking advantage of Tia, but he finds Bug with another girl. He binds and gags Bug and locks him in his car&#x27;s trunk, then finds a tearful Tia, who admits Buck was right about Bug. Opening the trunk, Buck forces Bug to apologize to Tia before letting him go. Bug threatens to sue Buck, but Buck hits him with golf balls, causing him to flee in terror.

Tia reconciles with Buck, then mends his relationship with Chanice by admitting she lied and telling Chanice that Buck would make a good husband and father. Buck also agrees to take a steady job at Chanice&#x27;s auto shop. Bob and Cindy return from Indianapolis after Cindy&#x27;s father recovers, and Tia surprises her mother with a hug; Cindy promises that their relationship will improve. As he prepares to leave, Buck invites Tia to meet up with him in the city before exchanging a loving goodbye.

==Production==
The film was the first one directed, written, and produced by John Hughes under a multi-picture agreement deal with Universal. Filming began on January 4, 1989, in Chicago. The company decided to keep the production facilities and locations as close as possible. The vacant New Trier High School in Northfield, Illinois, was chosen for the production facility. Three of its gyms were converted into sound stages on which several sets were constructed including the two-levelled interior of the Russell House, Buck&#x27;s bedroom, and smaller sets. The school was also equipped to suit the needs of the cast and crew behind-the-scenes, with classrooms for the young actors, offices, dressing rooms, a wardrobe department, editing facilities, a special effects shop, equipment storage areas, and a projection booth. 

Production designer John Corso began designing the sets in October 1988 and within seven weeks his construction crew of twelve carpenters and five painters began work on the two levels of the Russell house. The elementary school corridor, the boys&#x27; restroom, the principal&#x27;s office, and a classroom were filmed at Wilmette&#x27;s Romona Elementary School. A colonial-style house in Evanston was chosen for the exterior of the Russell house. The exteriors and practical locations were shot in Chicago, Cicero, Skokie, Northbrook, Wilmette, Winnetka, Glencoe, and Riverwoods.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $8.8 million on its opening weekend in 1,804 theatres and was placed No. 1 at the box office. The film stayed in first place for three more weeks before being bumped down to second by &quot;Sea of Love&quot;. Its US earnings were 18th in 1989, and the film has earned nearly $80 million worldwide since its release.

===Critical reception===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a score of one and a half out of four, writing that &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; was unusually bitter and angry for a Hughes movie: &quot;...Hughes is usually the master of the right note, the right line of dialogue, and this time there&#x27;s an uncomfortable undercurrent in the material&quot;.

==Television series and remake ==

A television series was broadcast on CBS in 1990. It starred Kevin Meaney as Buck, a slob who drinks and smokes. When Bob and Cindy die in a car accident, he is named the guardian of Tia, Miles, and Maizy. The show was not received well by TV critics. After it was moved to Friday, in an attempt by CBS to establish a comedy night there, its ratings quickly plummeted and it was cancelled.

In June 2016, ABC premiered a second television adaptation featuring an African-American cast with Mike Epps in the title role, James Lesure as his brother, and Nia Long as Buck&#x27;s sister-in-law. It suffered a similar fate as the previous TV adaptation, as it was poorly received by critics and then cancelled after eight episodes. In 1991, the film was remade in Malayalam language and released as &quot;Uncle Bun&quot;.

<text>Take 6 is an American a cappella gospel sextet formed in 1980 on the campus of Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama. The group integrates jazz with spiritual and inspirational lyrics. Take 6 has received several Grammy Awards as well as Dove Awards, a Soul Train Award and nominations for the NAACP Image Award. 

The band has worked with Ray Charles, Nnenna Freelon, Gordon Goodwin, Don Henley, Whitney Houston, Al Jarreau, Quincy Jones, k.d. lang, Queen Latifah, The Manhattan Transfer, Johnny Mathis, Brian McKnight, Luis Miguel, Marcus Miller, Joe Sample, Ben Tankard, Randy Travis, CeCe Winans, Stevie Wonder and Jacob Collier. All original members grew up in the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

==Biography==
===Oakwood College years===
In 1980, Claude McKnight, older brother of R&amp;B musician Brian McKnight, formed an a cappella quartet, The Gentlemen&#x27;s Estates Quartet, at Oakwood College (now Oakwood University), a Seventh-day Adventist university in Huntsville, Alabama, where he was a freshman. He auditioned students for the group. While rehearsing in a campus bathroom to prepare for a performance, Mark Kibble heard them singing. He joined the harmonizing, adding a fifth part with them onstage that night. Kibble invited Mervyn Warren to join the group, which performed under the name Alliance. Alliance performed in local churches and on campus with a changing roster of members. In 1985, the lower half of the group (bass, baritone, and second tenor) left after graduating. Alvin Chea, Cedric Dent, and David Thomas joined.

===Career===
The band signed a contract with Warner Alliance in 1987 and changed its name to Take 6 after a search revealed the name &quot;Alliance&quot; was in use. Their self-titled debut album (1988) won Grammy Awards in the gospel and jazz categories and three Dove Awards. They contributed to the film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; and sang on the album &quot;Back on the Block&quot; by Quincy Jones. They also appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Spike Lee &amp; Company: Do It a Cappella&quot;. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;So Much 2 Say&quot; (1990) appeared on the gospel, jazz, and R&amp;B charts of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. The band then signed with Reprise. In 1991, after the release of &quot;So Much 2 Say&quot;, Mervyn Warren left the group to pursue a career as a record producer and was replaced by Joey Kibble, Mark Kibble&#x27;s younger brother. The group added instrumentation to their a cappella sound on the album &quot;He Is Christmas&quot;.

In 2006, the group started the label Take 6 Records; &quot;Feels Good&quot;, the first album on their new label, was released the same year. In 2007, they recorded with Eros Ramazzotti for his album &quot;E²&quot;. A year later Take 6 released &quot;The Standard&quot;, which ventured into more traditional jazz territory.

&quot;Believe&quot; (Sono, 2016), produced by Claude Villani and Ross Vannelli, charted in six categories on &quot;Billboard&quot; in its first two weeks of release. &quot;Iconic&quot; (Sono, 2018), produced and arranged by the band, was its first album to chart at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Contemporary Jazz Chart. The first single was a cover version of &quot;Change the World&quot; by Eric Clapton and debuted on the Contemporary Jazz Song chart in the top 30. The second single, &quot;Sailing&quot;, is a cover of the Christopher Cross classic.

Lahti was born in Birmingham, Michigan, the daughter of Elizabeth Margaret (née Tabar), a painter, homemaker, and nurse, and Paul Theodore Lahti, a surgeon. She has three sisters, Carol, Catherine, and Linda, and two brothers, Paul Jr. and James Lahti. Her paternal grandparents were Finnish immigrants and her maternal grandparents were from Austria-Hungary. Lahti was raised in the Lutheran Church.

Lahti studied Fine Arts at Florida State University and received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in Drama from the University of Michigan, where she joined Delta Gamma sorority. She studied acting at HB Studio in New York City, as well as completing a two-year professional actor training program at the William Esper Studio for the performing arts in Manhattan.

==Career==
After college, Lahti headed to New York City in 1973, where she worked as a waitress and did commercials. Her breakthrough movie was &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1979) with Al Pacino. In the film &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot; (1981), starring Richard Dreyfuss and John Cassavetes, she was cast as a physician who grows attached to a paralyzed patient seeking the right to leave the hospital. Later, she was cast in an important role in &quot;Running on Empty&quot;, a 1988 movie in which she and Judd Hirsch played the parents of a musically promising son; the family went underground to avoid the FBI after the parents had damaged a napalm factory, and they all must periodically move on short notice and assume new identities. She has also focused on television, beginning with her role in the made-for-TV adaptation of &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; (1982). She appeared on Broadway in Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s seriocomic play, &quot;The Heidi Chronicles&quot;.

Lahti received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Swing Shift&quot; (1984), and won an Academy Award for Best Short Film, Live Action for &quot;Lieberman in Love&quot; (1995), in which she starred and also directed. It was adapted from &quot;Lieberman in Love&quot;, a short story by W. P. Kinsella. Lahti won a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award in 1998 for her role in &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;. Lahti was in the bathroom when she won the third award and finally came to the stage following an attempt by show producer John Tinker to accept on her behalf and an interruptive riff by Robin Williams. In 1999, she presented with a piece of toilet paper attached to her shoe as an &quot;inside joke&quot; about her previous appearance.
In 2001, her first directorial feature-length film, &quot;My First Mister&quot;, was released. Starring Leelee Sobieski and Albert Brooks, the movie debuted with good reviews. In DVD commentary she applauds the work of her cast and crew, remarking &quot;[I] was very lucky to have such a wonderful crew...&quot; She said she felt regret that the film was rated R, for language, despairing that the movie might not be viewed by teens who would relate with the characters. Also, Lahti mentioned that she would have liked to have had more time to shoot different perspectives in order to facilitate story arc.

Lahti starred in the executive ADA role on&quot; Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as Sonya Paxton while the character Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was in appeals. She was in the first four episodes of the 11th season and returned for the show&#x27;s eighth episode, where she clashed with Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March). Lahti later guest starred in the ninth and 17th episodes of the 12th season, where she reprised her role as Paxton. Her character was murdered in the 17th episode.

She returned to Broadway upon joining the cast of the Tony Award–winning play &quot;God of Carnage&quot; on November 17, 2009, replacing Marcia Gay Harden. Both actresses had a few special appearances on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. In September 2011, Lahti starred with Morgan Freeman in the Broadway debut of Dustin Lance Black&#x27;s play, &quot;8&quot;—a reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California&#x27;s Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage—as Kris Perry. In March 2012, she was featured with Jamie Lee Curtis and Jansen Panettiere at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre. The production was broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights.

Her book of autobiographical essays, titled &quot;True Stories From an Unreliable Eyewitness,&quot; was published in 2018 by Harper Wave.

In 2020, Lahti appeared as a guest on the &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; marathon fundraiser episode of &quot;The George Lucas Talk Show.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lahti has been married to television director Thomas Schlamme since September 4, 1983. They have three children. Lahti resides in Los Angeles, California, with her family. She also owns an apartment in Greenwich Village.

In 2004, Lahti took part in a protest against the murders of women in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico.

Since May 2005, Lahti has been a contributor at &quot;HuffPost&quot;.

<text>Moesha () is an American television sitcom that aired on UPN from January 23, 1996, to May 14, 2001. The series stars R&amp;B singer Brandy as Moesha Denise Mitchell, an African-American teenager living with her upper middle class family in the Leimert Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. It was originally ordered as a pilot for CBS&#x27; 1995–1996 television season but was declined by the network. It was then later picked up by UPN, which aired it as a mid-season replacement. It went on to become the biggest success for the nascent network and one of the greatest hits over the course of the network&#x27;s entire run. The series was a joint production for UPN by Regan Jon Productions, Saradipity Productions, and Jump at the Sun Productions in association with Big Ticket Television.

==Overview==
The series focused on the life of a black upper-middle-class family through the eyes of a typical girl named Moesha. Her father Frank, a widower and Saturn car salesman (and later owner of his own dealership, Brothers Saturn), has married Dee, the vice principal at Moesha&#x27;s high school, much to Moesha&#x27;s disapproval. The series was created by Ralph Farquhar, along with the writing team of Sara V. Finney and Vida Spears. The settings for the show include the Mitchell household, teen hangout The Den, and in some cases, Crenshaw High School, the school attended by Moesha, Kim, Niecy, and Hakeem. The sitcom was set in the Leimert Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.

===Issues addressed===

The show dealt with real social issues affecting teenagers, such as premarital sex, the death of a parent, teen pregnancy, drug use, race relations, sexuality, dementia, and day-to-day issues teenagers faced at home and school such as gender prejudice and inequality. In one of the most controversial episodes, &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot; (aired February 7, 2000), the Mitchell family learned from Aunt Hattie that Frank is the biological father of Dorian, whom the Mitchells and Dorian himself believed to be Frank&#x27;s nephew. The shocking news of Frank&#x27;s infidelity during his first marriage turned the family upside-down and resulted in Dorian&#x27;s rebellion and Moesha moving out of the family home and into a dorm room. 

Moesha was also the first Black-cast sitcom to have an episode devoted to teenagers and non-heterosexuality. The episode, &quot;Labels&quot; (aired October 1, 1996), concerned Hakeem&#x27;s cousin Omar showing up at the Mitchell&#x27;s home and the family fears he could be another Hakeem. Instead, he seems to be nice and responsible. Moesha, still grieving about her break-up with Q, goes out on a date with Omar. After attending a movie, they meet Omar&#x27;s friend, Tracy, leading Moesha to believe that Omar may be gay. Moesha later tells Kim and Niecy her suspicions, and it doesn&#x27;t take long until everyone in school knows the latest gossip. When Hakeem hears the news, Moesha realizes that she may have jeopardized their friendship.&quot;

==Cast and characters==

===Overview===
===Main===
* Brandy Norwood as Moesha Denise &quot;Mo&quot; Mitchell – Like many teenagers, Moesha is trying to find her place in life. Moesha narrates the series about life lessons that she learns at the end of the episode. At every turn, Moesha, along with her friends and family, experiences new challenges and hilarious situations associated with the pressures and demands of growing up in an often confusing world. Moesha is headstrong, independent, and at times stubborn, but stands up for what she believes is right. She can sometimes be rebellious toward her father and stepmother. Through the first five seasons, Moesha would open the show speaking her thoughts into her diary. In Season 5, it&#x27;s revealed that Moesha has a second brother, Dorian. She moves out after hearing this. Moesha is 15–16 years old in season 1, and is 20-21 by season 6.
* William Allen Young as Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; Mitchell – A Saturn car dealer and father to Moesha and Myles. Originally thought to be Dorian&#x27;s uncle, he is later revealed to be the young man&#x27;s father. Frank is also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He is a graduate of Southern University and A&amp;M College. Frank and Dee are strict disciplinarians to their children. He married Dee after his first wife, Moesha and Myles&#x27;s mother, died.
* Sheryl Lee Ralph as Deidre &quot;Dee&quot; Mitchell (Seasons 1–5; recurring in Season 6) A high school principal attempting to balance her career with two additional roles as wife to Frank and stepmother to Moesha and Myles. Dee is also a strict disclipinarian to the kids. She is originally from Jamaica and would speak in a thick Jamaican accent when talking about her childhood or when angered. It is implied that Dee is a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority due to a quote in the episode &quot;Niece&quot; in which Moesha says that she wouldn&#x27;t be persuaded by Dee with &quot;Delta&quot; picnics. Ralph left her role as a main cast member following season 5. She did not appreciate the storyline in which the family discovered that Frank was Dorian&#x27;s real father.
* Countess Vaughn as Kimberly Ann &quot;Kim&quot; Parker (Seasons 1–4) – Moesha&#x27;s boy-crazy best friend who has a crush on Hakeem during the first two seasons, but later dates Michael. She leaves the show after the fourth season to star in her own spin-off series &quot;The Parkers&quot; with Mo&#x27;Nique, who played her mother, Nikki Parker. She and Nikki graduate from Crenshaw High School in 1999 and go on to study at Santa Monica College. Kim originally planned to go to the Fashion Institute of Leimert, but ended up going to SMC after the former shut down suddenly toward the end of her senior year of high school.
* Marcus T. Paulk as Myles Mitchell — Moesha&#x27;s pesky younger brother. Early in the series, he is known mostly for playing practical jokes on his sister and her friends. Throughout the series, he progresses from 3rd grade to 8th grade.
* Lamont Bentley as Hakeem Campbell — A frequent visitor to the Mitchell household, he is Moesha&#x27;s lifelong friend and neighbor, and later her boyfriend. In the spin-off &quot;The Parkers&quot;, it was revealed that he and Moesha were no longer in a relationship. He dated Kim&#x27;s best friend Stevie Van Lowe (played by Jenna von Oÿ). 
* Yvette Wilson as Andalusia Louise &quot;Andell&quot; Wilkerson (Seasons 1–5) — Moesha&#x27;s adult friend and owner of the neighborhood hangout The Den. During season 5 she sells her establishment to a local funeral director. Andell is featured on the spin-off show &quot;The Parkers&quot;, where she owns a self-named restaurant and bar.
* Shar Jackson as Denise &quot;Niecy&quot; Jackson (Seasons 2–6; recurring in Season 1) — Moesha&#x27;s best friend and later her roommate. She has four brothers and four sisters whom she has to care for during high school, so she does not find time to work during high school like her friends Hakeem and Moesha. Niecy also made a guest appearance in a season 1 episode of &quot;Girlfriends&quot;.
* Fredro Starr as Quinton &quot;Q&quot; Brooks (Seasons 2 &amp; 3; recurring Seasons 4–6) — Moesha&#x27;s longest-running love interest. He is from New York City and had an on-and-off relationship with Moesha until departing in the middle season 3 to manage a hip-hop group. Frank dislikes him, because he feels is a bad influence on Moesha. In season 6, Q proposes to Moesha and she accepts, but the engagement is called off when Q wants to sell Moesha&#x27;s engagement ring to help support his hip-hop group on Thanksgiving.
* Ray J as Dorian Long (Seasons 5 &amp; 6) — Moesha and Myles&#x27; long lost half-brother, previously said to be their cousin. Dorian is originally from Oakland, California, but runs away from his mother&#x27;s home to live with the Mitchells.

==Production==

===Opening credits===
There have been different versions of the opening credits theme song, which was performed by Brandy. One version was used for season 1, a second version was used for seasons 2 and 3, and a third version was used for the final three seasons. Although the same recording of the theme song was used for the last three seasons, two different openings were used for each of the first three seasons.

The opening sequence for season 1 shows Moesha dancing in front of a fountain, walking with friends, dancing in a moving car, and winning at a game of chess while waving at a guy as he walks away.

The opening sequence for seasons 2 and 3 features the same scenario with some changes. Moesha was still dancing in front of the fountain but with a bass guitar player behind her. Instead of just depicting Moesha with her friends, this intro sees her playing basketball and baseball with her friends and family, driving with her friends, strutting down a block with Kim and Niecy, teaching Kim how to rollerblade (later replaced with footage of Moesha &amp; Q chasing Myles), and once again being served a meal at the diner by Andell while seated with her family. When Moesha is again distracted by a cute guy walking by, Frank tries to cover Moesha&#x27;s eyes.

Season 4 showed the cast around the neighborhood and Moesha, Kim, and Niecy dancing at the fountain while wearing red outfits.

Season 5 showed the cast dancing in a panoramic view as Norwood lip-syncs to the theme song on a background of clouds and a rising sun. The introduction for season 6 is similar to that of season 5, but features a twist. Since Yvette Wilson left &quot;Moesha&quot; to join the cast of &quot;The Parkers&quot; and Sheryl Lee Ralph&#x27;s character Dee became a recurring character, the season 6 opening features footage of Norwood lip-syncing over the portion of the theme song where Yvette Wilson and Sheryl Lee Ralph appeared in the previous season&#x27;s opening.

===Spin-off and Brock Akil universe===
Given her popularity for four seasons on &quot;Moesha&quot;, Countess Vaughn left the show in 1999 for her spin-off, &quot;The Parkers&quot;, which premiered on August 30, 1999, on UPN. It centered on Kim attending community college with her mother, played by comedian Mo&#x27;Nique. Leaving &quot;Moesha&quot;, Yvette Wilson joined the cast of &quot;The Parkers&quot; as Andell Wilkerson, Nikki&#x27;s childhood friend.

Several &quot;Moesha&quot; cast members (including Brandy Norwood, William Allen Young, Shar Jackson, Sheryl Lee Ralph, and Marcus T. Paulk) made crossover appearances on &quot;The Parkers&quot;. Lamont Bentley, being the most frequent, appears in three episodes.

Though not a direct spin-off of &quot;Moesha&quot;, the show &quot;Girlfriends&quot; was created by &quot;Moesha&quot; writer Mara Brock Akil and exists in the same universe as &quot;Moesha&quot;. The character Maya Wilkes (Golden Brooks) from &quot;Girlfriends&quot; lives in Leimert Park like the characters of &quot;Moesha&quot;, and appeared in an episode babysitting for her sister-in-law Barbara Lee, who happened to be Dorian&#x27;s birth mother. Niecy appeared in a season 1 episode of &quot;Girlfriends&quot;.

The CW series &quot;The Game&quot; was spun off from &quot;Girlfriends&quot; with the loose thread of main character Melanie Barnett (Tia Mowry) being a cousin of &quot;Girlfriends&quot; main character Joan Clayton (Tracee Ellis Ross). The Melanie and Derwin characters re-appeared in the &quot;Girlfriends&quot; Season 7 finale episode at Joan&#x27;s engagement party. On &quot;Moesha&quot;, Brandy played herself as a celebrity doppelganger to Moesha, and ironically Brandy joined the cast of &quot;The Game&quot; in its fifth season as Chardonnay Pitts, further complicating the notion of the show existing in the same universe.

===Cancellation===
By the sixth season, ratings for &quot;Moesha&quot; had dropped and UPN opted not to renew or air the series for a seventh season. The series ended on an unresolved cliffhanger with Myles being kidnapped by a rival of Dorian, Moesha considering moving in with Hakeem or her best friend Niecy, and a positive pregnancy test being found in the trash at Moesha&#x27;s dorm room, without positive identification as to whose it was. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported a rumor that certain plots were to be resolved on &quot;The Parkers&quot;, but those storylines were ultimately never resolved.

===Possible revival===
On November 3, 2017, the cast reunited on &quot;The Real&quot; and have expressed interest in reviving the show. &quot;Absolutely, we need a reboot to this show, because we ended on a cliffhanger.&quot; Norwood pointed out. In August 2020, Norwood revealed she was in talks for a reboot, citing the show&#x27;s success on Netflix.

==Syndication==
The show aired in syndication on UPN, Fox, and The WB affiliates. The series aired on WGN America (now &quot;NewsNation&quot;) from 2005 to 2008, The N from 2005 to 2009, Up TV, BET Her, and BET until mid 2016, Fuse until 2019, Bounce TV until 2021, and currently airs on Dabl since 2023. On Up TV, it was edited for content to make it more &quot;family-friendly&quot; and was often edited heavily for broadcast on BET and BET Her due to airtime constraints.

In the UK, &quot;Moesha&quot; aired on Channel 4 from 1996 until 1998, with only the first three seasons being broadcast. It also aired on Nickelodeon from 1996 to 2000, who only showed episodes from the first four seasons which were edited so they would be more suitable for broadcast on children&#x27;s television. Paramount Channel aired the series from 2000 to 2003, as did Trouble from 2003 to 2006. From 1 November 2019, the programme started airing on Trace Vault following its rebrand from The Vault.

Since 2008, the show has aired in international syndication in Spain, Portugal, Israel, the Middle East, Russia, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, South Africa, Latin America, Brazil, and Australia. In Spain, it ran on Disney Channel from 2005 to 2011 in an edited format deemed suitable for children&#x27;s television. In Italy the series currently airs on Canale 8.

The series is currently streaming on Netflix in the US, while spinoff series &quot;The Parkers&quot; is available to stream on the platform as well. The series is also available to stream on Paramount+, BET+, and Hulu.

==Home media==
On September 27, 2011, CBS Home Entertainment released &quot;Moesha: The First Season&quot; on DVD in Region 1 via Amazon.com&#x27;s CreateSpace program. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Amazon.com.

<doc id="657785" wikidata="Q2470888" url="?curid=657785" title="Chop Top">
<text>Robert Sawyer, better known as &quot;Chop-Top&quot; is a fictional character from &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; franchise; created by Tobe Hooper and L. M. Kit Carson, Chop-Top makes his first appearance (portrayed by Bill Moseley) in the film &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; (1986) as one of the film&#x27;s villains and the main source of its black humor.

A member of the cannibalistic Sawyer family, Chop-Top, whose actual name is revealed to be Robert (shortened to &quot;Bobby&quot; or &quot;Bloody Bobby&quot;) in the planned spin-off &quot;All-American Massacre&quot;, is a hippie-like antagonist and comedic relief character who makes frequent remarks related to his PTSD flashbacks and napalm from his time as a Vietnam veteran.

Chop-Top adorns himself in a variety of multi-colored and tattered clothing and claims that music is his life.

== Backstory ==
Throughout &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;, pieces of Chop-Top&#x27;s past are revealed. The Hitchhiker, Chop-Top&#x27;s twin brother, states in the first film that their grandfather (Grandpa Sawyer) formerly worked in a slaughterhouse where he was highly esteemed for his ability to manually execute cattle at quick speeds. In the sequel, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;, Drayton &quot;The Cook&quot; Sawyer explains that Grandpa Sawyer left the slaughterhouse when it transitioned from manual slaughter to the use of machines like captive bolt pistols. After having quit his job in protest, Grandpa Sawyer and his family fell into poverty. 
At some point prior to the first film, Grandma Sawyer, Great Grandma Sawyer, and the parents of Drayton, Chop-Top, Bubba (Leatherface), and The Hitchhiker (aka &#x27;Nubbins&#x27;), passed away, leaving Drayton, the eldest son, to serve as head of the family. 
Having no other skills (save for Drayton&#x27;s cooking), no money, and no food, the family was reduced to cannibalism. The Sawyer family began killing people for meat to be used in their chili and barbecue, which was sold to the general public at Drayton&#x27;s Gas Station/Restaurant. However, it is suggested in the first film that Drayton did not kill anyone himself and left it to his three younger brothers while he did all the cooking.

During the events of the first film, Chop-Top was stationed as an infantry soldier in the Vietnam War, where he survived a major head wound due from a machete-wielding enemy soldier. A metal plate was grafted onto his skull at a VA hospital, earning him the name Chop-Top (or Plate-Head, as he was originally referred to in the script). At some point in time the plate became exposed. It is implied that this happened because of his habit of heating a wire coat hanger and picking pieces of skin from his scalp to eat, as he is seen doing throughout the film. 
Once he is released from the VA hospital, Chop-Top rejoins his family, who are on the run from the authorities for the murders they&#x27;ve committed, and purchases an abandoned amusement park located in Dallas called &quot;Texas Battle Land&quot; using money he received from the government after being discharged from the military for his injury. Chop-Top fashions his twin brother Nubbins&#x27; corpse into a crude, marionette-like form, which he carries around with him and treats as if it were alive.

== Appearances ==
=== Films ===
In &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;, Chop-Top first appears with his brother Bubba &quot;Leatherface&quot; Sawyer (Bill Johnson) attacking a pair of drunken motorists named Buzz and Rick on a bridge with their pick-up truck. Chop-Top drives the truck while Leatherface kills the two drivers, (The top of Buzz&#x27;s head is cut off by Leatherface and Rick is killed in the resulting car crash), not realizing that the events were being recorded by the radio station Rick and Buzz had called into using a mobile phone prior to the attack. When DJ Vanita &quot;Stretch&quot; Brock (Caroline Williams) broadcasts the recording of the attack on the drivers, Chop-Top and Leatherface call Drayton to alert him of the broadcast. Drayton then instructs Chop-Top and Leatherface to break into the radio station and kill the DJ.

Stretch finds Chop-Top waiting on a couch in the station and enjoying some music and wearing a Sonny Bono wig to cover his plate. He talks excitedly with her about how she is his favorite DJ and that he and Leatherface &quot;listen to her every night&quot;. After some back-and-forth, Leatherface emerges from a vault to attack Stretch, but mistakenly hits Chop-Top instead. Chop-Top emerges ultimately unharmed, besides a dent in his plate, and the plan to kill Stretch fails as Leatherface becomes infatuated with the DJ He tricks Chop-Top into believing he has killed her when the two leave the station, taking an injured co-worker of Stretch&#x27;s (who was attacked by Chop-Top with a hammer and thought dead until later on in the film) with them.

When Chop-Top and his other brother Drayton (Jim Siedow) discover that Stretch is still alive after finding her in the family&#x27;s home in an abandoned amusement park called the Texas Battle Land, the three brothers take her captive and decide to let the decrepit patriarch of the Sawyer family, Grandpa Sawyer (Ken Evert), kill her with help from Chop-Top. Vanita is saved when protagonist Lieutenant &quot;Lefty&quot; Enright Hardesty (uncle to Sally and Franklin from the first film) (Dennis Hopper) bursts on to the scene and engages in a chainsaw duel with Leatherface. The battle between the Sawyers and Lefty reaches a climax when a hand grenade, is set off by Drayton, explodes, killing Grandpa, Lefty, Leatherface and Drayton.

Narrowly escaping the grenade explosion, Chop-Top follows Stretch, who had also escaped, to the top of a Matterhorn attraction in the Texas Battle Land, which the Sawyers have turned into a shrine known as &quot;Chainsaw Heaven&quot;. Slashing Vanita several times with a straight razor, Chop-Top is knocked off of the Matterhorn when Vanita, stumbling upon the mummified corpse of Great-Grandma Sawyer, tears a chainsaw out of her hands and attacks Chop-Top with it, sending him plummeting into the ruins of Texas Battle Land.

&quot;All American Massacre&quot;, a currently unreleased film, reveals that Chop-Top survived the fall into Texas Battle Land and was found three years later, arrested, found insane and placed in a mental institution where he had remained for the last 10 years; taking place 13 years after the second film, the film was going to have him being interviewed from his prison cell by a tabloid television journalist, narrated by Chop-Top, &quot;All American Massacre&quot; was to reveal, via flashbacks, the origin of the Sawyer family&#x27;s cannibalism and what their real names are. The trailer for the film also indicates that he was in Vietnam for less than a full year as it says that &quot;It&#x27;s been 25 years since he last saw his twin brother alive&quot; and the second film takes place 13 years after the first totaling 26 years.

=== Literature ===
Though Chop-Top does not appear in the 1991 &quot;Leatherface&quot; by Northstar Comics, a reference to him is made in the form of his catchphrase &quot;Lick my plate!&quot;, which can be seen spray painted on the side of Alfredo Sawyer&#x27;s Last Chance Gas Station.

Chop-Top was completely disregarded in the 1995 Topps Comics &quot;Jason vs. Leatherface&quot; comic miniseries, which featured only the members of the Sawyer family from the 1974 film and original relatives (all dead); although elements of him appear to have amalgamated into the Hitchhiker character, who refers to Leatherface as Bubba and utilizes the phrase &quot;Dog will hunt!&quot; several times, much like Chop-Top.

== Concept and creation ==

A character named Platehead appeared in the initial Kim Henkel treatment for the film. The character was later changed to Chop-Top by L. M. Kit Carson when he was hired on to write the feature film script.

Bill Moseley was chosen for the role of Chop-Top after director Tobe Hooper saw a fan film and parody he created, &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Manicure&quot;, in which Moseley portrayed the Hitchhiker, a favorite character of his and his inspiration when acting as Chop-Top. The documentary &quot;In Search of Darkness&quot; features an exclusive behind-the-scenes story on how Moseley landed the role of Chop-Top.

==Reception and legacy==

The critical reception of the film itself was mixed, due to the drastic tonal shift between this installment and the original. Despite the mixed critical reception, the character of Chop-Top and the portrayal by Moseley was welcomed by fans. The film has since become a cult favorite, leading to Chop-Top becoming one of the more recognizable horror antagonists from the 1980s.

Chop-Top has become Moseley&#x27;s most iconic performance as well as the actor&#x27;s personal favorite. During the celebration of the film&#x27;s 31st anniversary, Moseley paid tribute to Chop-Top for kickstarting his career stating, &quot;And finally to Choptop, who&#x27;s with me every day, and without whom I might just be pumping your gas (at least in Oregon)! Dog will hunt!&quot;
When Moseley was asked to return to the Texas Chainsaw franchise, this time portraying Drayton Sawyer in &quot;Texas Chainsaw 3D&quot; originally portrayed by Jim Siedow, Moseley took the opportunity, but expressed disappointment that Chop-Top would not be returning. Moseley stated &quot;I would love to have done that character [Chop-Top], I came close when I did &quot;Texas Chainsaw 3D&quot; a couple of years ago. I got the call from the producer of that movie saying we want you to play Drayton Sawyer. And I&#x27;m just thinking, &#x27;Well that&#x27;s like asking Moe to come back and play Curly. Or Curly to come back and play Moe, I guess is more accurate.&quot; The character was also almost featured in the 2017 prequel film &quot;Leatherface&quot;. However the character was replaced with the character of Clarice portrayed by Jessica Madsen, who was intended to be an homage to Chop Top. There are complicated rights issues related to the character which have prevented him from appearing in any further &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; related projects, including the 2023 video game based on the series, and Moseley has expressed interest in buying the rights himself.

A statuette of Chop-Top has been released by Mezco Toyz; the figure is seven inches tall and has twelve points of articulation, and comes packaged with accessories such as alternate weapons and the puppet corpse. A figure of Chop-Top has also been released by NECA, featuring his iconic coat hanger, hammer, Sonny Bono wig, lighter and razor. A mini-bust of Chop-Top has also been released.

The Primus song &quot;Jerry Was a Race Car Driver&quot; features a sound-sample of Chop-Top, chuckling to himself then remarking: &quot;Dog will hunt!&quot; with the sound of a chainsaw in the background.

<text>Kenidjack Valley (, meaning &quot;place abounding in firewood&quot;), sometimes referred to as Nancherrow Valley (, meaning &quot;acre valley&quot;), is a steep-sided valley in Cornwall, United Kingdom.

The Tregeseal River flows down the valley and discharges into the Atlantic a few hundred yards north of Cape Cornwall , half-a-mile north-east of the village of St Just.

The valley was an important area of tin mining and the remains of Wheal Owles, Wheal Castle, Boswedden Mine and the Kenidjack arsenic works are still visible. The shallow adit from the Wheal Boys lode to the valley probably dates before 1670. Gunpowder, for blasting mines in Cornwall, was introduced to Cornwall shortly after 1670, and the shallow adit does not show any evidence of blasting.

Today, the valley is popular for hiking and birdwatching.

One year after the brutal murders of her friends Helen Shivers and Barry Cox by the vengeful fisherman Ben Willis, Julie James is attending summer classes in Boston, but suffers from nightmares of the incident. Julie&#x27;s roommate, Karla Wilson, receives a phone call from a local radio station and wins a vacation for four to The Bahamas. Julie invites her boyfriend, Ray Bronson, who, despite initially declining, decides to go. That evening, Ray and his co-worker, Dave, drive to Boston to surprise Julie, but stop due to a body in the middle of the road. When Ray discovers the body is a mannequin, Ben appears and kills Dave with his hook, then chases Ray in a truck, but Ray escapes and falls down a hill.

The next morning, Julie, Karla, Karla&#x27;s boyfriend, Tyrell Martin, and their friend, Will Benson, depart for the trip. The group arrives at the hotel in Tower Bay and checks in. Elsewhere, Ray, at the hospital, disappears. That evening at the hotel&#x27;s bar, Julie is singing karaoke when the words &quot;I still know what you did last summer&quot; roll on-screen. Terrified, she runs back to her room. Will confesses he likes Julie. Darick, a dockhand, is tying up a boat when he is then murdered by Ben. Afterwards, Olga, the housekeeper, finds bloody sheets. Ben then slices her, dragging her into a room. The others get into a hot tub while, Julie, in her room, is unable to find her toothbrush. She searches her room before finding Darick dead in the closet. Horrified, she informs them, but Darick&#x27;s body is missing; Mr. Brooks, the hotel manager, refuses to believe her story. Mr. Brooks notes they are unable to leave the island due to an incoming storm. By the pool, Titus Telesco is murdered. Ray, who has survived his injuries, heads out to rescue Julie.

The next day, the group finds Olga, Titus, and Mr. Brooks murdered and the two-way radio, their only way of contact, destroyed. Isolated, the group goes to the room of Estes, the boat hand porter, and finds that he has been using voodoo against them. Estes appears, explaining he was trying to protect them after realizing that their answer to the radio station&#x27;s question was incorrect. He tells them that Ben and his wife, Sarah, had two children: a son and a daughter. Ben murdered Sarah when he found out about an affair. Estes goes missing and Will volunteers to find him, while Ray takes a boat to the island. Julie, Karla, and Tyrell return to the hotel and find Nancy, the bartender, hiding in the kitchen.

Ben appears in the kitchen and kills Tyrell. The girls retreat to the attic, where Karla is attacked by Ben. Julie and Nancy rescue Karla and run to the storm cellar, where they find Ben&#x27;s victims. Will bursts in and takes the girls back to the hotel, stating that he saw Ben on the beach. At the hotel, Will tells them that Estes attacked him and he is bleeding from the stomach. Nancy and Karla leave to find a first aid kit, but find Estes impaled with a harpoon. Ben appears, kills Nancy and attacks Karla. While Julie tends to Will, he reveals that it is not his blood and asks Julie what her favorite radio station is, revealing that he was the radio host and had killed Estes.

Will drags Julie to a graveyard, where he reveals that he is Ben&#x27;s son. Ben appears and attacks Julie before Ray arrives and engages in a fight with Will. When Ben tries to stab Ray, he accidentally kills Will instead. While Ben is distraught from killing his son, Julie shoots him dead. Back at the hotel, Karla is found alive and they are rescued by the coast guard.

Sometime later, Ray and Julie get married and buy a home. Ray is brushing his teeth and the bathroom door is locked while he is occupied. Julie sits down on the bed and looks in the mirror, seeing Ben underneath. She screams as Ben pulls her under the bed.

==Production==
In 1997, director Mike Mendez pitched a sequel to &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; that would have brought back Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze, Jr. in a college setting. The following February, British filmmaker Danny Cannon was announced as director, unrelated to Mendez&#x27;s idea. Matthew Settle, Brandy, Hewitt and Prinze Jr. joined the cast in March 1998, with Jennifer Esposito joining a month later.

In a 2018 interview, writer Trey Callaway revealed that he was asked by Mandalay Pictures if he was interested in penning the script for the sequel. A fan of the original, Callaway agreed, pitched his take, and was hired. In order to capitalize on the success of the first movie, the studio was eager to get production underway, with filming starting around six months after Callaway sold his pitch. Mandalay had also hired Stephen Gaghan to write a different version of the screenplay, with it reportedly set in New Orleans. They eventually chose Callaway&#x27;s script over Gaghan&#x27;s; however, in early promotional trailers, Gaghan was listed as co-screenwriter.

* The song &quot;Eden&quot; by Belgian rock/pop group Hooverphonic was also featured in the film, but did not appear on the final soundtrack. The song appeared early in the film, when Julie looked at the picture of Helen beside her bed.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film made $16.5 million from 2,443 theaters during its opening weekend, finishing second behind holdover &quot;The Waterboy&quot;. At the end of its 15-week run, the film grossed $40 million in the United States.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 7% based on 58 reviews and an average rating of 3.5 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Boring, predictable and bereft of thrills or chills, &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; is exactly the kind of rehash that gives horror sequels a bad name.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 21 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; said: &quot;Purists will find the pic&#x27;s obviousness disappointing, but there&#x27;s no question that the film delivers a sufficient shock quotient to satisfy its youthful target audience.&quot;

In a 2017 interview, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; director Jim Gillespie, said: &quot;I thought it wasn&#x27;t the right story. I didn&#x27;t like the premise. It kind of killed the franchise a little bit. They had a chance to do something a bit different and for me it didn&#x27;t work.&quot;

==Sequel==
On August 15, 2006, a direct-to-video film titled &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; was released. The film is unrelated to the two previous films and features no returning cast members. It was originally proposed to continue where &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; left off. Instead, the film features an unrelated plot with a brief mention of the first two films.

In February 2023, a new legacy sequel was announced to be in development with Hewitt and Prinze Jr. in talks to star, and Jennifer Kaytin Robinson directing from a script by Leah McKendrick.

==Book==
A paperback edition of the screenplay was published in 1998.

<doc id="657800" wikidata="Q3124683" url="?curid=657800" title="H. M. Walker">
<text>Harley M. Walker (June 27, 1878 – June 23, 1937) was a member of the Hal Roach Studios production company from 1916 until his resignation in 1932. The title cards he wrote for Harold Lloyd, Charley Chase, &quot;Our Gang&quot; and Laurel and Hardy comedies &quot;have entered legend, both for silent films, and as opening remarks for the earlier talkies.&quot; He was also an officer of the Roach Studio corporation.

==Background==
Like many screenwriters of the time such as Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, Walker came to the screen trade from the freewheeling world of newspaper journalism. He was a sports writer for the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; before joining Roach.

On Roach&#x27;s &quot;Lot of Fun&quot;, script development usually started with meetings among the gag men, who would develop what was known as an &quot;action script&quot;: the outline of the story and a description of the scenes and some of the sight gags, which generally would run three to six legal-size pages. This document would then pass to Walker, the head of the editorial department, which oversaw not only script editing, but film editing as well. Walker usually came up with the title of each film, wrote &quot;brilliantly witty&quot; title cards which would be produced and inserted into the film, and wrote a critique before the picture went out to the distributors, Pathé Exchange, or later, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

Walker was a chain-smoking eccentric, a cat fanatic whose office always had a few tabbies in residence. His exterior was gruff and he was often difficult to get along with. Director Tay Garnett had an early-career one-day trial as an assistant writer to Walker, whose only reaction to Garnett&#x27;s efforts was a guttural &quot;yeah.&quot; Then, Garnett, &quot;who soon discovered Walker&#x27;s &#x27;yeah&#x27;s to be the equivalent to a round of applause, was told &#x27;Come back tomorrow—on salary.&#x27;&quot; Film editor Richard Currier recounted that Walker never drove a car, so his wife had to drive him to work every day. But Currier was fond of Walker, calling him &quot;a prince of a guy,&quot; and remembered the present of a dictionary with a note that read like one of Walker&#x27;s title cards: &quot;Having listened for years to your astonishing, and, at times, highly-charged vocabulary, I hasten to add to your voltage.&quot;

As sound came to motion pictures, Walker and his staff were writing cards for Roach series including the &quot;Our Gang&quot; and Laurel and Hardy comedy short subjects. But as witty as his title cards had been, Walker was less adept at writing spoken dialogue for talkies. &quot;Much of his work for Laurel and Hardy was so unwieldy and out of character that complete on-set revision was necessary,&quot; says &quot;The Laurel and Hardy Encyclopedia&quot;. Laurel and Hardy scholar Randy Skretvedt writes that Walker&#x27;s &quot;contribution to the L&amp;H films was relatively minor&quot; and that comparison of the &quot;action&quot; and &quot;dialogue&quot; scripts with the finished film &quot;usually reveals that most of Walker&#x27;s dialogue went unused.&quot;

One discarded example of dialogue was from an early Laurel and Hardy sound short &quot;Hog Wild&quot; (1930) when Mrs Hardy chats to her husband about looking for the hat that is perched on his head (as he is suffering from amnesia):

Mrs Hardy: &quot;You must&#x27;ve put it somewhere! Hats don&#x27;t walk!&quot;

Ollie: &quot;Why not? They feel don&#x27;t they? You&#x27;ve heard of felt hats, haven&#x27;t you? (savagely) Haw, haw, haw!&quot;

Mrs Hardy: &quot;Well well, America&#x27;s greatest humorist is in again.&quot;

Skredtvedt stated that the dialogue in the released film was &quot;far less &#x27;gaggy&#x27;, and much more amusing.&quot;

A turning point was reached at Roach in 1931 with the arrival of a new general manager, Henry Ginsburg, a boorish man universally despised on the lot and called by Stan Laurel &quot;The Expeditor&quot;. Ginsburg&#x27;s every move was aimed at cutting costs, often at great harm to the studio&#x27;s creative output. One of the first casualties was cameraman George Stevens, who would go on to win two Oscars for Best Director. Among the next was Beanie Walker, who resigned after sixteen years over disputes with Ginsburg&#x27;s cost-cutting edicts.

After leaving the Roach studio, Walker wrote dialogue for comedies produced by ex-Roach general manager Warren Doane at Universal Pictures. Later, he worked at Paramount Pictures, where he contributed to the W. C. Fields picture &quot;The Old Fashioned Way&quot; (1934).

==Death==
Walker died of a heart attack on June 23, 1937, four days short of his 59th birthday, while dining in the Chicago apartment of Leroy Shield, his friend and composer of much of the Roach Studio&#x27;s music.

<text>Drew Christopher Brees (; born January 15, 1979) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 20 seasons. A member of the New Orleans Saints for most of his career, Brees is second all-time in career passing yards, career touchdown passes, career pass completions, and career completion percentage. Brees also holds the record of consecutive games with a touchdown pass, with 54 games, breaking the record held by Johnny Unitas for 52 years. He is regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.

Brees played college football for the Purdue Boilermakers, where he set the Big Ten Conference records for completions, attempts, and yards. Due to questions over his height and arm strength, he was not selected until the second round of the 2001 NFL draft by the San Diego Chargers. Brees initially struggled before having a breakout season in 2004, earning him Pro Bowl and Comeback Player of the Year honors. Re-signed to a one-year contract, Brees suffered a potentially career-ending injury the following season, which resulted in the Chargers allowing him to leave in free agency. Joining the Saints, he brought new success to a franchise that had only seven winning seasons, five playoff appearances, and one postseason win during the 39 years prior to his arrival. From 2006 to 2020, Brees led the Saints to seven division titles (including four consecutive from 2017 to 2020), nine playoff appearances, nine playoff wins, three NFC Championship Game appearances, and the franchise&#x27;s first title in Super Bowl XLIV, earning him the game&#x27;s MVP award.

By the conclusion of his 15 seasons in New Orleans, Brees had extended his total Pro Bowl selections to 13 and was twice named Offensive Player of the Year. He also led the NFL in passing yards a record seven times. Brees retired after the 2020 season and spent the following year as an analyst on &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;. He returned to Purdue as an interim assistant football coach in 2022.

==Early life==
Brees was born on January 15, 1979 in Dallas, Texas, to Eugene Wilson &quot;Chip&quot; Brees II, a prominent trial lawyer, and Mina Ruth (née Akins; died 2009), an attorney. His grandfather fought in the Battle of Okinawa. A &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article stated he was named for Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Drew Pearson but in a 2014 interview Brees said this story was &quot;just legend&quot;. He has a younger brother, Reid (born 1981). When Brees was seven, his parents divorced and shared custody of the boys, who split their time between both parents&#x27; homes. Today, he admits that it was a very tough and challenging life after the divorce; however, Brees and his younger brother, Reid, supported each other and became very close. They have a younger half-sister, Audrey, from their father&#x27;s remarriage to Amy Hightower, daughter of the late U.S. Representative (D-TX) Jack English Hightower. Brees was raised Baptist.

Both of Brees&#x27;s parents had athletic backgrounds. His father played basketball at Texas A&amp;M, and his mother was a former all-state athlete in three sports in high school. His maternal uncle, Marty Akins, was an All-American starting quarterback for the Texas Longhorns college football team from 1972 to 1975, and his maternal grandfather, Ray Akins, had the third-most victories as a Texas high school football coach, in his three decades at Gregory-Portland High School. His younger brother, Reid, was an outfielder for the Baylor Bears baseball team, which made the 2005 College World Series; Reid now resides in Colorado, where he works in sales.

After moving to the Austin area, Brees did not play tackle football until high school and was on the flag football team at St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal School, where his teammates included actor Ben McKenzie, who was in the same year. In high school, he was a varsity letterman in baseball, basketball, and football, and was considering playing college baseball rather than football. College recruiters quickly ran after Brees blew out his knee in the 11th grade. After overcoming the ACL tear, he was selected as Texas High School 5A Most Valuable Offensive Player in 1996 and led the Austin Westlake High School football team to a 16–0 record and a state championship. As a high school football player, Brees completed 314 of 490 passes (64.1 percent) for 5,461 yards with 50 touchdowns, including in his senior season, 211 of 333 passes (63.4 percent) for 3,528 yards with 31 touchdowns. When Brees started for two seasons, Westlake went 28–0–1 and beat a Dominic Rhodes-led Abilene Cooper 55–15 in the 1996 title game. He was given honorable mention in the state high school all-star football team and the &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA high school football team, alongside former San Diego Chargers teammate and longtime friend LaDainian Tomlinson. Brees had hoped to follow in his father&#x27;s and uncle&#x27;s footsteps and play for the Texas Longhorns or Texas A&amp;M Aggies, but was not heavily recruited despite his stellar record.

==College career==
Brees received offers from only two colleges, Purdue and Kentucky, choosing Purdue for its highly rated academics. He graduated in 2001 with a degree in industrial management, and is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

After a relatively uneventful freshman season, Brees was given his first start during his sophomore year by Boilermakers head coach Joe Tiller and became an integral part of Tiller and Jim Chaney&#x27;s unorthodox &quot;basketball on grass&quot; spread offense, serving as offensive captain during his junior and senior years. In the 1998 season, in a game against Wisconsin, Brees tied an NCAA single-game record with 55 completions and set the NCAA record for pass attempts in a single game with 83. He finished 31–24 loss with 494 yards, two touchdowns and four interceptions. He had the option to make himself available for the 2000 NFL draft but chose to return for his senior year to complete his studies. In 2000, he led the Boilermakers to memorable last-minute upsets against top-ranked Ohio State and Michigan en route to the Boilermakers&#x27; first Big Ten championship (shared with Michigan and Northwestern) since 1967. The Ohio State game was replayed on ESPN Classic and is widely remembered for Brees&#x27;s four interceptions and 64-yard touchdown pass to Seth Morales with 1:55 remaining to seal a vital 31–27 win, prompting commentator Brent Musburger to exclaim &quot;Holy Toledo!&quot; and a post-game field rush. Brees helped lead Purdue to a #9 ranking in the AP Poll, the program&#x27;s highest spot since the 1980 season, during the year. Due to head-to-head victories over Michigan and Northwestern, Purdue won the invitation to the 2001 Rose Bowl, which was the school&#x27;s first appearance there since 1967.

Brees was a finalist for the Davey O&#x27;Brien Award as the nation&#x27;s best quarterback in 1999. He won the Maxwell Award as the nation&#x27;s outstanding player of 2000 and the NCAA&#x27;s Today&#x27;s Top VIII Award as a member of the Class of 2001. Brees was also fourth in Heisman Trophy voting in 1999 and third in 2000. As a senior, Brees became the first Boilermaker since Bruce Brineman in 1989 to earn Academic All-America honors. Additionally, he won Academic All-Big Ten honors a record three times, was initiated into Mortar Board and awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor and the NFF National Scholar-Athlete Award. Brees also was awarded Purdue&#x27;s Leonard Wilson Award for unselfishness and dedication.

In his college career, Brees set two NCAA records, 13 Big Ten Conference records, and 19 Purdue University records. He left Purdue with Big Ten Conference records in passing yards (11,792), touchdown passes (90), total offensive yards (12,693), completions (1,026), and attempts (1,678). He tied an NCAA record with the 99-yard pass to receiver Vinny Sutherland against Northwestern on September 25, 1999, and held the NCAA record for pass attempts in a game (83) for 15 years, until Washington State quarterback Connor Halliday broke it in October 2013.

In 2009, Brees was inducted into Purdue&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame. The Big Ten Conference&#x27;s Griese–Brees Quarterback of the Year award initiated in 2011 was named in his and Bob Griese&#x27;s honor. He was named the Big Ten&#x27;s best quarterback of the 1990s and ranked number 48 on the 2010 documentary &quot;Big Ten Icons&quot;, featuring the conference&#x27;s top fifty student-athletes.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===San Diego Chargers (2001–2005)===

====2001 NFL draft====
Brees&#x27;s college success led to projections that he would be a mid–late first-round draft pick in the 2001 NFL draft, but he slipped due to concerns about his relatively short stature for a professional quarterback (6&#x27;0), a perceived lack of arm strength, and a sense that he had succeeded in college in a spread offense. Brees was the second quarterback selected in the 2001 NFL Draft behind Michael Vick of Virginia Tech. He was chosen by the San Diego Chargers with the first pick of the second round with the 32nd overall pick. San Diego originally had the first pick in that draft, but traded it to Atlanta (who drafted Vick) in return for the fifth pick of the first round with which San Diego drafted LaDainian Tomlinson.

====Early career====

In his rookie season, Brees was the backup quarterback to Doug Flutie, who started all 16 games that season. Brees played in his first professional game on November 4, 2001, against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 8. He came into the game to relieve Flutie, who had suffered a concussion. He finished with 221 passing yards and his first career passing touchdown, a 20-yard pass to Freddie Jones. The game against the Chiefs was Brees&#x27;s lone appearance as a rookie.

On August 19, 2002, Brees was named the starter for the 2002 season over Doug Flutie. He started all 16 games for the Chargers. The season started off well for the Chargers with a 6–1 start, but faded down the stretch with a 2–7 record over the last nine games to finish 8–8. He finished the 2002 season with 3,284 passing yards, 17 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions.

In Week 4 of the 2003 season, Brees recorded a 21-yard touchdown reception on a pass thrown by LaDainian Tomlinson in the 34–31 overtime loss to the Oakland Raiders. After a disappointing 1–7 start to the 2003 season, Brees was replaced by Flutie, though he regained the job by Week 15. In 11 games, he finished with 2,108 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions.

====2004 season====

Brees&#x27;s career with the Chargers was in jeopardy after San Diego acquired NC State&#x27;s Philip Rivers after the 2004 NFL draft. With a looming quarterback controversy, he performed well through training camp and the preseason, while Rivers held out during training camp, essentially guaranteeing Brees the job to begin the season with Rivers as his backup.

Brees remained the starter throughout the 2004 season, where he started 15 games and led the team to a 12–4 regular season record. In Week 8, against the Oakland Raiders, he was 22 of 25 for 281 yards and five touchdowns in the 42–14 victory to earn his first AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor. Brees posted spectacular numbers, completing 65.5% of his passes for 3,159 yards, with 27 touchdowns to only seven interceptions, giving him a 104.8 passer rating. The Chargers won the AFC West for the first time in ten seasons and Brees was selected to the 2004 Pro Bowl. He was named 2004 NFL Comeback Player of the Year. In the Wild Card Round against the New York Jets, Brees had 319 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and one interception in the 20–17 overtime loss.

====2005 season====

Brees became a free agent after the 2004 season and was not expected to return to San Diego, which had already committed a large sum of money to Rivers. The team eventually designated Brees a franchise player, giving him a one-year contract that quadrupled his pay to $8 million for 2005. Under the terms of the franchise player contract, Brees was eligible to be traded or to sign with another team, but the Chargers would receive two future first-round draft choices in return. He was not traded and continued as the starting quarterback for the remainder of the 2005 season.

After a 1–2 start, Brees helped lead a 41–17 victory over the New England Patriots. He was 19 of 24 for 248 passing yards and two touchdowns and earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the effort. He posted a career-high in passing yards with 3,576. Brees also posted an 89.2 rating, 10th best in the NFL. However, in the last game of the 2005 season against the Denver Broncos, Brees tore his labrum while trying to pick up his own fumble after being hit by Broncos safety John Lynch. Denver tackle Gerard Warren hit Brees while he was on the ground, causing the injury. Brees underwent arthroscopic surgery, performed by Dr. James Andrews, to repair the torn labrum in his right (throwing) shoulder on January 5, 2006. Subsequent reports mentioned additional partial rotator cuff damage and he also was treated by Dr. Saby Szajowitz to recover and regain muscle movement.

After the season, the Chargers offered Brees a five-year, $50 million contract that paid $2 million in base salary the first year and the rest heavily based on performance incentives.

===New Orleans Saints (2006–2020)===
After the Chargers refused to increase their offer, Brees met with other teams. The New Orleans Saints and the Miami Dolphins were interested in Brees. New Orleans made an offer that included $10 million in guaranteed money the first year and a $12 million option the second year. Miami was unsure whether Brees&#x27; shoulder was completely healed and doctors suggested the team should not sign him because of the injury. The Dolphins ended negotiations and traded for Minnesota Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper instead. Brees signed a six-year, $60 million deal with the Saints on March 14, 2006. The Dolphins&#x27; decision to not sign Brees was the reason why Nick Saban resigned and left for Alabama.

====2006 season====

Brees had a productive first year with the Saints. The team, under first-year head coach Sean Payton, rebounded from its disastrous 2005 season, when the team was unable to play in New Orleans due to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina and struggled to a 3–13 record, to finish with a 10–6 regular season record and won the NFC South division title. The Saints also earned the NFC&#x27;s second seed as well as a first-round bye. On November 5, in the 31–14 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he had 314 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn his first NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor. On November 19, in a 31–16 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, he threw for a career-high 510 passing yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions. Brees&#x27;s 510 passing yards marked a single-game franchise record and was the sixth most for a single game in NFL history at the time. In Week 14, a 42–17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, he had 384 passing yards and five touchdowns to earn his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week award in 2006. Brees threw a league-leading and franchise record 4,418 passing yards, finished third in the league with 26 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions, and had a 96.2 passer rating. Brees was named starting quarterback for the NFC in the 2007 Pro Bowl and was named as a First-team All-Pro. On January 5, 2007, Brees was named first runner-up behind former teammate Tomlinson for league MVP by the Associated Press. Brees and Tomlinson were co-recipients of the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award.

On January 13, 2007, in his first playoff game for New Orleans, Brees was 20–of–32 in passing attempts with one touchdown and no interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles in the Divisional Round at the Louisiana Superdome. The Saints held on to win 27–24, and advanced to the franchise&#x27;s first NFC Championship Game against the Chicago Bears. Though he completed 27 of 49 passes for 354 yards and two touchdowns, Brees committed three costly turnovers, and was penalized for an intentional grounding in the endzone, resulting in a safety, as the Saints lost in the NFC Championship by a score of 39–14. Brees dislocated his left elbow during the first quarter of the Pro Bowl.

====2007 season====

Brees&#x27;s second season with the Saints started rough with a 0–4 start, with three losses by the Saints in that stretch by at least 17 points. However, the Saints started a winning streak after Week 5. In Week 8, a 31–10 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, he had 336 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. After the next game, a 41–24 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Saints were back at .500 with a 4–4 record. In Week 15, a 31–24 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, he had 315 passing yards and two touchdowns to earn another NFC Offensive Player of the Week nod in 2007. In Week 17, against the Chicago Bears, Brees tied Aaron Brooks&#x27;s franchise record for pass attempts in a single game with 60 in the 33–25 loss. Overall, in the 2007 season, Brees passed for 4,423 yards, topped his own record and tied a then franchise record with 28 touchdowns. He also set the NFL record previously held by Rich Gannon for pass completions in a single season with 440. However, the Saints missed the playoffs with a 7–9 record.

====2008 season====
In 2008, the Saints again missed the playoffs but Brees had a strong year statistically, finishing 15 yards short of the NFL record for passing yards thrown in a single season set by Dan Marino in 1984. In Week 3, against the Denver Broncos, Brees set a single-game franchise record for pass completions with 39 in the 34–32 loss. He passed for 421 yards and a passing touchdown in the loss. Brees earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month for September, going over 300 passing yards and having a passer rating over 110 in three of the four games. In Week 6, a 34–3 victory over the Oakland Raiders, he was 26 of 30 for 320 yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 8, a 37–32 victory over the San Diego Chargers, he had 339 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn another NFC Offensive Player of the Week nod. In Week 12, a 51–29 win over the Green Bay Packers, he had 323 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor in 2008. He finished the season with 5,069 yards and became the second quarterback in NFL history to throw for over 5,000 yards in a season.

He passed for 300 yards ten times during the 2008 season, tying Rich Gannon&#x27;s 2002 record. He was named FedEx Air Player of the Week for his performances during Weeks 8 and 12 and was named the AP 2008 Offensive Player of the Year. He was named to his third career Pro Bowl for his 2008 season.

Brees started to serve on the executive committee of the National Football League Players Association this season. He remained on the committee through the 2014 season.

====2009 season: Super Bowl XLIV====
In the first game of the 2009 season against the Detroit Lions, Brees set a career-high and franchise-tying record with six touchdown passes, going 26 out of 34 for 358 yards. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Lions. The next week, Brees led the Saints to a 48–22 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, throwing for 311 yards and three touchdown passes. Brees also tied the record for most touchdown passes by the end of Week 2 with nine touchdowns. Following Week 3, Brees was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for September. In Week 6, against the 5–0 New York Giants, Brees completed 23 of 30 passes for 369 yards, four touchdown passes, and a passer rating of 156.8 in a dominant 48–27 victory to his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week nod of the season.

In Week 7, Brees led a dramatic comeback victory on the road against the Miami Dolphins, 46–34. The Saints quickly faced a 24–3 deficit in the second quarter, trailing for the first time all season at that point, and failing to score on their first possession as they had in all of their previous contests. Brees had a poor outing, but provided two crucial rushing touchdowns, one just before halftime to narrow the deficit to 24–10, and one in the third quarter to give the Saints their first lead of the game, 37–34. The 21-point comeback tied for the largest in franchise history.

The next week, Brees threw for 308 yards on 25 of 33 passing along with two touchdowns and one interception in leading the Saints to a 35–27 victory and franchise tying best start at 7–0 against the rival Atlanta Falcons. In week 9, Brees helped guide the team to a 30–20 victory over the Carolina Panthers. This was Brees&#x27;s first victory over the Carolina Panthers in the Superdome and gave the Saints their best start in franchise history at 8–0. In Week 12, Brees led the Saints to an 11–0 record, defeating the New England Patriots 38–17 on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. Brees totaled 371 yards passing, posting a perfect passer rating of 158.3, and became the first player to throw for five touchdowns against a team coached by Bill Belichick. He earned his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week nod for the 2009 season. After close victories over the Washington Redskins and Falcons in successive weeks to start 13–0, Brees and the Saints lost for the first time that season to the Dallas Cowboys, 24–17, after DeMarcus Ware caused a Brees fumble in the final seconds, ending a fourth quarter rally. The Saints lost their last two games, with Brees sitting out the Week 17 finale against the Carolina Panthers. Their 13–3 record secured the #1 seed in the NFC. The 13 regular season victories set a single-season franchise record for the Saints.

Brees&#x27;s individual statistics led to numerous accolades, including a Pro Bowl selection, the Maxwell Football Club&#x27;s Bert Bell Award, and runner-up in voting for the AP MVP, Offensive Player of the Year, and First-team All-Pro awards. He finished the season with a completion percentage of 70.62, establishing a new NFL record.

In the Divisional Round, Brees recorded 247 passing yards and three touchdowns as the Saints routed the Arizona Cardinals 45–14. In the NFC Championship, The Saints defeated the Minnesota Vikings 31–28 in overtime to help the Saints advance to their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Brees completed 17 of 31 passes for 197 yards and three touchdowns. The Saints defeated the Indianapolis Colts 31–17 in Super Bowl XLIV on February 7, 2010. Brees tied a Super Bowl record with 32 pass completions and won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award. He threw for 288 yards and two touchdowns. It was the first league championship in Saints franchise history. Brees was named the 2010 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Sportsman of the Year, both for his winning the Super Bowl and his charitable work towards the reconstruction of New Orleans. On December 17, 2010, he was named AP Male Athlete of the Year. Within four short years after joining the Saints, Brees was more accurate in his throws than any of the Saints&#x27; past quarterbacks. Brees and his teammates were welcomed back to New Orleans with a blues band along with thousands of celebrating fans.

====2010 season====
In the 2010 regular season, Brees passed for over 300 yards seven times and helped lead the Saints to a six-game winning streak late in the season. The Saints qualified for the playoffs with a 11–5 record, but were eliminated in the Wild Card Round by the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 41–36 in the Beast Quake game. Brees finished with 404 passing yards and two passing touchdowns in the loss. Brees was selected to his fifth Pro Bowl-fourth with the Saints. Brees had a less successful season statistically, throwing a career-high 22 interceptions, tying the franchise record held by Aaron Brooks, although he managed to throw for 4,620 yards and 33 touchdowns. He was ranked ninth on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011 players&#x27; list.

====2011 season====
The 2011 season was a record-breaking season for Brees as he led the NFL in completion percentage, passing yards and passing touchdowns, which is known as the &quot;Triple Crown&quot;. He broke Dan Marino&#x27;s 27-year-old record for most passing yards in one season (5,084) in the 15th game of the season (week 16) against the Atlanta Falcons at home in New Orleans at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome with a touchdown pass to Darren Sproles. Brees also set a new Saints franchise record for passing touchdowns in a season with 46.

In Week 2, during the Saints&#x27; home-opener, Brees defeated the Chicago Bears for the first time in his career as a starting quarterback, leaving the Baltimore Ravens as the only remaining NFL team which Brees had never beaten to that point. On October 23, in a 62–7 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, he was 31 of 35 for 325 passing yards and five touchdowns. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Colts. On November 28, a Week 12 49–24 victory over the New York Giants, he had 363 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In a home game on December 4 against the Detroit Lions, Brees passed for 342 yards. Brees&#x27;s performance gave him 4,031 yards on the season, making him the first quarterback in NFL history to eclipse the 4,000-yard mark in the first 12 games of a season, and the first quarterback to reach four consecutive seasons with 4,000+ yards and 30+ touchdown passes. In Week 15, against the Minnesota Vikings, Brees threw for 412 yards with five passing touchdowns. With that game, Brees became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for five touchdowns, 400+ yards, while also maintaining a completion percentage of 80%, in a game.

In Week 16, against the Atlanta Falcons at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Brees broke Dan Marino&#x27;s longstanding record of passing yards in a single season of 5,084 with a nine-yard touchdown pass to Darren Sproles with just under three minutes left in the fourth quarter of the game. He needed 305 yards to break the record entering the game and exceeded that mark with 307. He ended the game having thrown for 5,087 total passing yards for the regular season with one game remaining. With his second-quarter, eight-yard touchdown pass to Marques Colston, Brees extended his streak of consecutive games with a touchdown pass to 42 games. Marino congratulated Brees via Twitter after the game, saying &quot;Congrats to @drewbrees. Great job by such a special player.&quot; Brees responded by tweeting, &quot;Thanks to @DanMarino for his class and support during this run. It is an honor to attempt to follow the example he set for us all.&quot; He earned his third and final NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2011 season with his performance against the Falcons.

In Week 17, against the Carolina Panthers, Brees closed out the season by setting six NFL records, finishing the year with 468 completions for 5,476 yards, edging out Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, who also surpassed Marino&#x27;s record with 5,235 yards. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December to close out the season. Brees averaged 342.25 yards passing per game, which broke Dan Fouts&#x27;s record of 320.3 in a strike-shortened season. In 2013, Peyton Manning bested Brees&#x27;s record by one passing yard, and finished the season with an NFL-record 5,477 passing yards, averaging 342.31 yards per game. In the NFC Wild Card Round, Brees passed for 466 yards and three passing touchdowns as the Saints defeated the Detroit Lions by a score of 45–28. At the time, Brees&#x27;s 466 passing yards marked the second-most in a playoff game in NFL history. He did set the NFL record for passing yards in a regulation playoff game. However, Brees and the Saints lost in the Divisional Round to the San Francisco 49ers by a score of 36–32 in a back-and-forth contest. In the loss, Brees passed for 462 passing yards, four passing touchdowns, and two interceptions. He was named to his sixth career Pro Bowl. He was ranked as the second-best player in the league by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.

====2012 season====

On July 13, the Saints and Brees agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract. The contract included the largest amount of guaranteed money in NFL history, at $60 million. $40 million of the contract was paid the first year.

Due to the year-long suspension of head coach Sean Payton as a result of Bountygate, Brees entered the season with a temporary head coach in the form of offensive line coach Aaron Kromer, who was the Saints&#x27; coach for the first six games of the season while planned interim coach Joe Vitt was serving a suspension of his own. After Week 8, Vitt took over head coaching responsibilities for the rest of the 2012 season.

Brees and the Saints started the season with a 0–4 record. One highlight in that losing streak was in Week 4, when he passed for 446 yards and three touchdowns in a 28–27 loss to the Green Bay Packers. In Week 5, Brees threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to Devery Henderson against his former team, the San Diego Chargers. This was his 48th consecutive game with a touchdown pass. With that touchdown pass, Brees broke Johnny Unitas&#x27;s consecutive game streak with at least one touchdown pass, and Unitas&#x27; son Joe was present at the Superdome to witness his father&#x27;s 52-year-old record being broken. Sean Payton, Joe Vitt and Mickey Loomis, who were all serving suspensions due to the &quot;Bountygate&quot; scandal, were granted permission to watch the Week 5 game against the San Diego Chargers due to Brees potentially breaking Unitas&#x27; record. Brees earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his 370-yard, four-touchdown, and one-interception effort against the Chargers. Without their head coach, the Saints had lost their first four games but ended the losing streak with a 31–24 win over the Chargers.

In the Week 13 game against the Atlanta Falcons, Brees threw no touchdowns and a career-high five interceptions, ending his consecutive game streak with at least one touchdown pass at 54. In Week 14, against the New York Giants, Brees threw for 354 yards, giving him his seventh straight 4,000-yard passing season, surpassing Peyton Manning&#x27;s mark. It was also his fifth straight season with at least 30 touchdown passes and 4,000 yards passing, also an NFL record. Brees finished the 2012 season with 5,177 passing yards and 43 touchdowns despite having the worst defensive support in the NFL, whose 7,042 yards conceded was an all-time NFL record, and the team finished the season with a 7–9 record and missed the playoffs.

For the seventh time, Brees was selected to the 2013 Pro Bowl, this time as an injury replacement for Robert Griffin III. He was ranked 11th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.
====2013 season====

Brees and the Saints started the 2013 season with a 5–0 record. In that stretch was a Week 4 38–17 home victory over the Miami Dolphins, where he had 413 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 10, a 49–17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, he had 392 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn another NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor. In Week 12, Brees passed Warren Moon for fifth on the career passing yards list with 49,566. During Week 14, Brees became the fastest player ever to join the 50,000-yard club and only the fifth player to do so. He did it in 183 games, passing the 50,000 milestone on a pass to Jimmy Graham in the fourth quarter of a 31–13 Saints win over the Carolina Panthers on December 8, in which he threw four touchdowns. In Week 17, a 42–17 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he had 381 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week nod for the 2013 season. Brees also extended his NFL record to a sixth straight season of at least 30 touchdown passes with 4,000 passing yards, his third straight 5,000-yard season, and his eighth straight 4,000-yard season. For his successful performance in 2013, he was named to his eighth career Pro Bowl. The Saints finished with an 11–5 record and narrowly defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 26–24 in the Wild Card Round, but lost 23–15 to the Seattle Seahawks in the Divisional Round, who went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII. He finished ranked sixth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.

====2014 season====

Brees admits that the 2014 season was his &quot;most frustrating&quot;. The Saints finished with a 7–9 record and missed the playoffs. Brees&#x27; 2014 season began with a pair of games lost on game-ending field goals by the other team; in Week 1, the Saints lost 37–34 on the road to the Atlanta Falcons in overtime and in Week 2, in a 26–24 road loss to the Cleveland Browns, he moved into fourth place on the career passing yardage list, ahead of John Elway. On October 19, in a road game against the Detroit Lions, Brees became the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in completion percentage at 66.21%, surpassing Chad Pennington. On November 30, in a Week 13 35–32 road victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, he had 257 passing yards and five touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week, which was the 20th time in his career he has earned the award over his career in both the AFC with the Chargers and the NFC with the Saints. In a Week 15 road game against the Chicago Bears, he extended his streak to an NFL-record seventh straight season with at least 30 touchdown passes and nine straight seasons of 4,000 passing yards. However his streak of 5,000 passing yard seasons ended at three, as he passed for 4,952 yards, which was good enough to tie him with Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for the most passing yards in the league that season. The occurrence marked the first time in NFL history that two players tied for the passing yards lead. He was named to his seventh consecutive and ninth career Pro Bowl. He was ranked 30th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.

====2015 season====

Brees and the Saints started the 2015 season with an 0–3 start with two of the losses being by one possession. On October 4, 2015, in Week 4, his 80-yard touchdown pass to C. J. Spiller on the second play of overtime gave the Saints a 26–20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, and the team&#x27;s first win of the season. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Cowboys. The touchdown gave Brees 400 for his career, making him the fifth player in NFL history to reach the 400 touchdown milestone. Also, he became the fastest player ever to reach 400 touchdowns, doing so in 205 games. Brees also completed his 5,000th pass with a touchdown to tight end Josh Hill. It was the quickest regular season overtime win in the history of the NFL at 13 seconds.

On November 1, 2015, Brees tied the NFL record of touchdown passes in a game with seven during a 52–49 Saints win over the New York Giants. In that game, he completed 39-of-50 passes for 505 yards to record his second career game with at least 500 passing yards. He became the second player in NFL history to have multiple 500-yard passing games. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his historic performance against the New York Giants.

In Week 12, his streak of 45 consecutive games with a touchdown pass ended in a 24–6 loss at Houston. Two weeks later, he surpassed Dan Marino for fourth in career touchdown passes as the Saints beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by a score of 24–17. In Week 15, he became the fourth quarterback to reach the 60,000-yard milestone—in 215 games, the fastest ever—and had his 10th straight 4,000-yard season, plus his 94th 300-yard game, but the Detroit Lions won 35–27. This put him first in most 300-yard games as Brees and Manning had been tied at 93 games prior to that game. A week later, his streak was extended to an eighth straight season with at least 30 touchdown passes, plus his 95th 300-yarder, all NFL records, against the Jacksonville Jaguars. With a Week 17 win over the Atlanta Falcons, Brees finished the season with four straight 300-yard games, for a career record total of 96, and a season total 4,870 yards passing, leading the league in passing yards for a record sixth time despite missing one game due to an injury. Despite the accomplishments on the field, the Saints finished with a 7–9 record and missed the playoffs. He was ranked 30th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.

====2016 season====
In the Saints&#x27; 2016 season opener, Brees threw a career-high 98-yard touchdown pass to Brandin Cooks in a narrow 35–34 home loss to the Oakland Raiders. He finished the game 28–of–42 for 423 yards and four touchdown passes. His 400-yard performance tied him with Peyton Manning for the most 400-yard passing games in NFL history. The next week, he passed Dan Marino for third place in career passing yards in a loss to the New York Giants.

On October 16, in Week 6, Brees threw for 465 yards and four touchdown passes with one interception in a 41–38 home win over the Carolina Panthers. With this performance, Brees set an NFL record with the 15th 400-yard passing performance of his career. Brees reached another milestone in the game, becoming the sixth player to record 50,000 passing yards with one team. The other five players are Peyton Manning (Indianapolis Colts), Brett Favre (Green Bay Packers), Dan Marino (Miami Dolphins), Tom Brady (New England Patriots), and John Elway (Denver Broncos).

In Week 7, Brees became the first player in NFL history with 100 games of 300+ passing yards, in a loss against the Kansas City Chiefs on October 23.

During Week 16, Brees and Aaron Rodgers tied the NFL record for most seasons with at least 35 touchdown passes with four—a record shared with Peyton Manning and Tom Brady.

Brees finished the 2016 season leading the league in passing yards with 5,208, the second most of his career and the fifth 5,000-yard season of his career—more than all other 5,000-yard seasons combined (4). He threw for 471 completions, breaking his NFL record of 468 set in 2011, and a career-high 673 attempts. Brees finished third in touchdown passes with 37, the fourth most of his career. He finished second in completion percentage (70.0%), making it the third time he has completed at least 70% of his passes in a season. Despite his performance, for the third straight season, the Saints finished 7–9 and missed the playoffs. He was named to his tenth career Pro Bowl for his 2016 season. He was ranked 16th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.

====2017 season====
Brees and the Saints started the 2017 season with a 0–2 record before winning eight consecutive games. In Week 13, he passed Peyton Manning for second place in career completions in a 31–21 victory over the Carolina Panthers. On December 19, 2017, Brees was named to his 11th career Pro Bowl. During Week 16 against the Atlanta Falcons, Brees became the third player to amass over 70,000 passing yards in a career, doing so in an NFL fastest 248 games. In that game, he earned his 12th consecutive 4,000-yard season as the Saints won 23–13. Brees finished the 2017 season by setting a then-NFL record 72.0 completion percentage. He led the league in number of completions (386) and yards per pass attempt (8.1), and finished second in passer rating (103.9).

The Saints finished with an 11–5 record, won the NFC South, and returned to the playoffs for the first time since the 2013 season. In the Wild Card Round against the Carolina Panthers, he had 376 passing yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in the 31–26 victory. In the Divisional Round against the Minnesota Vikings, he had 294 passing yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 29–24 loss. He was ranked eighth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.

====2018 season====

On March 13, 2018, Brees signed a two-year, $50 million contract extension with the Saints with $27 million guaranteed.

In Week 1, Brees threw for more than 400 yards for a record 16th time in his career, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won 48–40. In Week 3, against the Atlanta Falcons, Brees broke Brett Favre&#x27;s record for career pass completions in the second quarter with his 6,301st career completion. In that game, a 43–37 overtime Saints victory, Brees threw for 396 yards and three touchdowns, and also ran for two more scores, including the game-winner in overtime, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 5, on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; against the Washington Redskins, Brees surpassed Peyton Manning for the NFL&#x27;s all-time passing yardage record with a 62-yard touchdown pass to Tre&#x27;Quan Smith late in the second quarter. He went on to complete 26 of 29 passes, setting a then career-high 89.66 single-game completion percentage, for 363 yards and three touchdowns in the 43–19 victory, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second time in three weeks. Following a bye week, Brees claimed his first career victory against the Baltimore Ravens with a score of 24–23, making him the third quarterback in NFL history to beat all 32 teams, joining Peyton Manning and Brett Favre. During this game, Brees also became the fourth quarterback in NFL history, along with Manning, Favre, and Tom Brady, to reach 500 career touchdown passes when he threw a 1-yard touchdown to Benjamin Watson. After a season-low 120 yards and his first interception of the season in a win over the Minnesota Vikings, Brees logged 346 yards, four touchdowns, and zero interceptions to hand the Rams their first loss of the season in Week 9. In a Week 10 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, Brees passed Brett Favre for second in career passing touchdowns with a 17-yard touchdown to Michael Thomas in a 51–14 victory. Brees was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Month for November passing for 16 touchdowns to two interceptions in that stretch.

Brees finished the season with 364 completions, 489 attempts, 3,992 passing yards, 32 passing touchdowns and five interceptions over 15 games. He sat out the season finale after the Saints had clinched the NFC&#x27;s #1 seed the week prior. He set an NFL record for completion percentage (74.4%), breaking his previous record (72.0%) set in , and led the league in passer rating (a career high of 115.7). However, with his 3,992 yards, his NFL record streak of 12 consecutive seasons with at least 4,000 passing yards came to an end. He led the league with six fourth quarter comebacks and seven game-winning drives.

In the Divisional Round against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Saints started badly, quickly falling into a 14–0 hole, but recovered and scored 20 unanswered points over the final three quarters to win and advance to their first NFC Championship Game since their 2009 Super Bowl winning season. Brees completed 28 of 38 passes for 301 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in the win. In the NFC Championship, Brees passed for 249 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception as the Saints lost 26–23 in overtime to the Los Angeles Rams following a controversial missed pass interference call on a play that started at the Rams&#x27; 13-yard line with 1:49 left in regulation. If called, the penalty could have allowed the Saints to run out most of the clock, due to the Rams having only one timeout remaining, and try a go-ahead field goal that would have likely won the game for New Orleans. Brees became the first and only player in NFL history to throw touchdown passes to 15 different players (of which nine were undrafted) in a single season, including the playoffs. He finished second in the MVP voting to Patrick Mahomes. He was ranked as the second best player in the NFL by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.

====2019 season====
In the first game of the season, a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; match against the Houston Texans, Brees threw for 370 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception as the Saints overcame a slow start to win 30–28. In the Saints&#x27; Week 2 game against the Los Angeles Rams, Brees suffered an injury to his right hand on a hit from Aaron Donald which forced him out of the game. The next day, an MRI revealed that Brees had suffered a torn ligament in the thumb of his right hand, which would require surgery and reportedly cause him to miss six to eight weeks. Brees returned in Week 8 against the Arizona Cardinals, finishing with 373 passing yards, three touchdowns, and an interception as the Saints won 31–9. In Week 14, against the San Francisco 49ers, Brees completed 29 of 40 passes for 349 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown, but his efforts were in vain as the Saints narrowly lost 48–46. During Week 15 against the Indianapolis Colts on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, Brees broke former Colts quarterback Peyton Manning&#x27;s record for most career touchdowns, throwing his 540th to tight end Josh Hill on his career-best 20th straight completion in the third quarter. Brees&#x27;s record-breaking touchdown pass was his third touchdown pass on the night. He finished the game with four touchdowns and 304 yards as the Saints defeated the Colts by a 34–7 score. In addition, Brees completed 29 of his 30 pass attempts for a career high and NFL single game record 96.7% completion percentage rate, surpassing the previous record (28 out of 29 passes for a 96.6% completion percentage rate) which had been set the previous year by his former Chargers teammate Philip Rivers. In the following week&#x27;s game against the Tennessee Titans, Brees threw for 279 yards and three touchdowns during the 38–28 win. During the game, Brees helped wide receiver Michael Thomas break the single season receptions record formerly held by Marvin Harrison with his 144th catch of the season.

In the game, Brees helped lead the Saints on a late drive to set up a game-tying field goal on a seven-play drive to force the overtime period. He earned his 13th career Pro Bowl nomination after Russell Wilson gave up his spot. He was ranked 12th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.

====2020 season====

On March 17, 2020, Brees signed a two-year, $50 million contract extension with the Saints.

In the Saints&#x27; regular-season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and their new quarterback Tom Brady, Brees completed 18 of 30 passes for 160 passing yards and two touchdowns, breaking Brett Favre&#x27;s record for most career pass attempts in the process, as the Saints won by a score of 34–23. Following the Week 1 victory, Brees helped lead the Saints to a 5–2 stretch leading into a second matchup with Brady in Week 9. Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;, he passed for 222 yards and four touchdowns in the 38–3 victory. With the win over the Buccaneers, Brees defeated Brady head-to-head for the second time.

On November 15, 2020, Brees left the Saints’ Week 10 game against the San Francisco 49ers following the first half with a rib injury suffered on a sack attempt from Kentavius Street. Brees completed 8 of 13 passes for 76 yards and a touchdown before leaving the game. The next day, it was revealed Brees had suffered multiple broken ribs and a collapsed lung from the hits he had taken during the game. On November 20, 2020, Brees was placed on injured reserve, thereby ruling him out for at least the following three games. After missing four games, Brees was activated on December 19, 2020, for the Saints&#x27; Week 15 game against the Kansas City Chiefs and threw for 234 yards, three touchdowns and one interception; during the Saints&#x27; 32–29 loss, Brees surpassed former Canadian Football League (CFL) quarterback Anthony Calvillo for first place in career passing yards in any professional outdoor gridiron football league. During the Saints&#x27; next game against the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas Day, Brees became the first quarterback in history to record 80,000 career passing yards as New Orleans won 52–33 to clinch a fourth straight NFC South title. Overall, he finished the 2020 season with 2,942 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and six interceptions in twelve games with the Saints finishing with a 12–4 record.

In the Wild Card Round against the Chicago Bears, Brees threw for 265 yards and two touchdowns during the 21–9 win. In the Divisional Round against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Brees threw for 134 yards and a touchdown but also threw three interceptions in a 30–20 loss.

On February 6, 2021, the Saints renegotiated Brees&#x27; contract, which reduced his salary down to $1.075 million for the upcoming season to save salary cap space. On March 14, 2021, exactly 15 years to the day that Brees signed his first contract with the New Orleans Saints, Brees announced his retirement after twenty seasons.

==Personal life==
Brees married his college sweetheart Brittany Dudchenko in February 2003. The couple have four children together: three sons born January 2009, October 2010, and August 2012, and a daughter in August 2014.

Brees moved to New Orleans not long after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. He admits that it was tough moving to a city that was still in shambles from the hurricane; however, he and Brittany immediately fell in love with the culture and &quot;soul&quot; of the city. They purchased and renovated a home in Uptown New Orleans, where they still live. Brees admits in an interview that he thinks his family is now completed especially because three boys and one girl were always the couple&#x27;s dream. All four children were born in New Orleans and are being raised there. The four priorities in Brees&#x27;s life are faith, family, football, and philanthropy; otherwise known as the &quot;four F&#x27;s&quot; by Brees. Brees kept a home in San Diego until he sold the property in 2012.

Brees is a Baptist. Brees was raised as a Christian but stated that he became committed at age 17 when he was at church with a torn ACL and was wondering who he was and what his purpose was in life. Brees later faced other trials such as tearing the labrum in his shoulder in 2005; however, he maintains that these setbacks only strengthened his relationship with God.

A birthmark on the right side of his face led to bullying when he was younger.

Throughout his youth, Brees attended Camp Champions, a co-ed summer camp in Marble Falls, Texas, for eight summers. Brees was twice voted &quot;Most Outstanding Camper&quot; by his peers during his tenure at the camp.

On July 6, 2010, Brees released his first book, entitled &quot;Coming Back Stronger: Unleashing the Hidden Power of Adversity&quot;, co-authored by Chris Fabry. &quot;Coming Back Stronger&quot; opened at number 3 on the nonfiction bestseller list of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 2010, Brees appeared in the Season 7 finale of &quot;Entourage&quot;.

Brees&#x27;s mother, Mina Brees, died on August 7, 2009, at age 59, from a prescription drug overdose. The death was ruled a suicide. Brees was briefly excused from training camp for a &quot;family matter&quot;. In 2006, Brees described their relationship as &quot;nonexistent&quot; ever since he refused to hire his mother as his agent when he entered the NFL, saying that she undercut his dealings with other agents and tried to sell a book about him to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; without his knowledge, and later that year he told her to stop using his picture in TV commercials during her campaign for the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals. After her death, Brees stated that this quote was three years old and that his relationship with his mother had been improving. In his autobiography, released almost a year later, he wrote that their relationship had been on the mend and that she had been looking forward to meeting his son, her first grandchild.

In April 2010, Brees was voted by fans as the cover athlete of EA Sports &quot;Madden NFL 11&quot; video game.

Brees wears #9 on his uniform in honor of late baseball player Ted Williams.

Brees is sometimes known by the nicknames &quot;Breesus&quot; by Saints fans and &quot;Cool Brees&quot;, which he acquired during his younger years for his calmness under pressure.

On March 30, 2010, Brees became the national spokesperson for AdvoCare International, a multi-level marketing company, which produces weight management, nutritional supplement, and personal care products.

Brees owns a variety of restaurant businesses. In May 2015, he purchased a 25% stake in &quot;Walk-On&#x27;s Bistreaux &amp; Bar&quot;, a sports bar that originated in Baton Rouge and is currently expanding their franchising into other Gulf Coast states. In 2019, he opened a Walk-On&#x27;s restaurant in Midland, Texas. During initial talks with Walk-On&#x27;s, Brees said that he was interested in bringing over some of the lessons that he had learned as a Jimmy John&#x27;s franchise owner. He currently owns nine Jimmy John&#x27;s stores with a tenth under construction . Carl Buergler, Jimmy John&#x27;s director of operations, played football at Purdue with Brees.

When Brees broke the NFL record for all-time passing yards, he sent a personalized football and letter to those players that helped him reach the milestone.

Brees utilizes former Major League Baseball player and coach Tom House as his mechanics coach.

In 2019, Brees partnered with San Diego Surf Sports to help with the local youth sports scene in the San Diego area.

Brees follows a strict diet, avoiding gluten, dairy, and nuts due to food allergies. He also has a regimented daily exercise routine, focusing on core strength exercises rather than heavy weight training.

Brees was a Republican, but later changed his party affiliation to Independent.

On June 3, 2020, during the George Floyd protests, Brees told Yahoo Finance that he stood by his 2016 opinion that kneeling during the national anthem was disrespectful to the flag and to the US. Several of his teammates and other professional athletes expressed disappointment and anger at the statement. He apologized early the next day.

In 2023, Brees revealed that he was unable to lift any part of his right arm over his shoulder anymore. He said that the condition is a result of the shoulder injury he suffered during his time with the Chargers.

==Charity and volunteer activities==

In 2010, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; described Brees as &quot;an athlete as adored and appreciated as any in an American city today&quot;. When &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; selected him for the 2010 Sportsman of the Year award, it said the award was &quot;[f]or not only leading the New Orleans Saints to the first Super Bowl title in the franchise&#x27;s history, but also for helping lead the city of New Orleans&#x27; rebirth after the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina&quot;. The fact that he and his family lived in New Orleans proper, instead of the suburbs like many players did, further endeared him to fans.

===Brees Dream Foundation===
In 2003, Brees and his wife, Brittany, founded the Brees Dream Foundation to support cancer patients and research in memory of Brittany&#x27;s aunt who died of cancer. Since Brees&#x27; move to New Orleans, the foundation has expanded to provide assistance for Hurricane Katrina rebuilding projects. The foundation continues to fund and support various programs in San Diego, California, where Brees usually spends his offseasons, and West Lafayette, Indiana, where the couple&#x27;s alma mater, Purdue, is located and where Brees returns to visit yearly.

Brees and his foundation have been heavily involved in Hurricane Katrina recovery. Drew and Brittany&#x27;s Brees Dream Foundation announced a partnership in 2007 with international children&#x27;s charity Operation Kids, to rebuild and restore and recreate academic and athletic facilities, parks, and playgrounds, after-school programs, mentoring programs for the intellectually disabled, neighborhood revitalization projects and child care facilities in New Orleans. Brees also sponsors the Rebuilding Through Brotherhood program to invite fellow Sigma Chi members to the New Orleans community to build homes with the Habitat for Humanity.

In July 2020, Brees and his wife, Brittany, partnered with Ochsner Health System and donated $5 million through the Brees Dream Foundation to help build numerous healthcare centers throughout Louisiana.

To date, the Brees Dream Foundation has donated over $35 million to charitable causes worldwide.

The Foundation was part of a joint initiative with BuildStrong and the Home Builders Institute to create the BuildStrong Academy. The academy offers students an opportunity to enhance their skills in the construction industry.

===Other activities===
Brees has been on multiple USO tours throughout his career. In late June 2009, he visited the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Following his return, Brees was quoted as stating that Guantanamo captives were being treated ten times better than convicts in U.S. prisons.

In February 2008, Brees signed a promotional deal with Chili&#x27;s Grill &amp; Bar to promote the chain&#x27;s new line of hamburgers. The promotion helped raise money for charity. In June 2008, Brees participated in the Pro Sports Team Challenge, a competition for professional athletes to help raise money for charities. The charity Brees played for was Operation Kids.

On February 18, 2007, Brees was honored by the Krewe of Bacchus, a New Orleans Mardi Gras parade organization, as the 2007 Grand Marshal of the Bacchus parade. Brees presided as Bacchus XLII for the 2010 parade on February 14, 2010, one week after the Super Bowl during Mardi Gras season.

In June 2010, President Obama appointed Brees to be co-chair of the newly renamed President&#x27;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, along with former Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes.

In October 2010, Brees appeared in an It Gets Better video, in which he gave an anti-bullying message in the wake of a series of suicides committed by gay teenagers.

In April 2018, Brees filed a lawsuit against a San Diego jeweler. The lawsuit claims Brees and his wife paid $15 million for investment-grade diamonds that an independent appraiser valued at only $6 million. On June 21, 2019, Brees was awarded $6 million in the lawsuit.

In March 2019, Brees partnered with Brandon Landry, co-founder of Walk-On&#x27;s, launching a new restaurant.

<text>The Next Karate Kid is a 1994 American martial arts drama film directed by Christopher Cain, produced by Jerry Weintraub, and written by Mark Lee. It serves as the fourth installment in the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; franchise, following &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; (1989). It stars Hilary Swank (in her first theatrical appearance in a starring role) as Julie Pierce, and Pat Morita reprising his role as Mr. Miyagi from the first three films (the only original cast member to return in this film), with Constance Towers, Chris Conrad, Michael Cavalieri, Walton Goggins, and Michael Ironside in supporting roles. Bill Conti, the composer of the previous films, returned to score the fourth. It is the first film in the series not to feature Ralph Macchio in the lead role as Daniel LaRusso.

Produced and distributed by Columbia Pictures, &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; was released on August 12, 1994 in Canada and was widely panned by critics.

==Plot==

Mr. Miyagi travels to Arlington National Cemetery for a commendation for Japanese-Americans who fought in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II. He is referred to as &quot;Keisuke Miyagi&quot; during the ceremony. While there he also meets Louisa Pierce, the widow of his commanding officer Jack Pierce, and they both listen to the opening speech given by Senator Daniel Inouye.

At Pierce&#x27;s home in Boston, Miyagi is also introduced to Pierce&#x27;s granddaughter, Julie, a teen struggling with anger issues due to her parents&#x27; death in a car accident. Her behavior has led to friction between Julie and her grandmother, along with her fellow students and teachers. She sneaks into the school at night to care for an injured Harris&#x27;s hawk named &quot;Angel,&quot; which she keeps in a pigeon coop on the roof.

Miyagi invites Louisa to stay at his house in LA to enjoy tending his garden while he remains in Boston as Julie&#x27;s caretaker. At school, Julie meets and befriends Eric McGowen, a teenage security guard-in-training and a pledge for a shady school security fraternity, the Alpha Elite. The members are taught to enforce the school rules, mostly using physical force, by a self-styled colonel, Paul Dugan. His toughest and most aggressive student is the short-fused Ned Randall, who makes unwelcome sexual advances upon Julie.

When Julie survives almost being hit by a car by jumping into a tiger position, she finally learns to confide in Miyagi when he recognizes her skill. She reveals she was taught karate by her father, who learned from her grandfather, Miyagi&#x27;s student.

While trying to feed Angel one night, Julie is detected by the Alpha Elite, who chase her through the school. Although she escapes them, she is arrested by the police and gets suspended for two weeks by Dugan.

Miyagi uses this time to take Julie to a Buddhist monastery to teach her the true ways of karate and how to handle her anger issues. Julie learns through direct lessons about balance, coordination, awareness, and respect for all life. She befriends the monks, who eventually have a birthday party for her, giving her a cake and an arrow that Miyagi had caught in mid-flight in a demonstration of Zen archery. They also concede to her wish that they visit her in Boston, where they go bowling with Miyagi. A local player challenges them, loses the match, and accepts their tutelage in how to bowl a strike blind.

Upon returning to school, Julie discovers that Angel was found by Ned, who called animal control. Miyagi assists Julie in releasing the bird back into the wild, using the pain suppression technique from the first film to heal her broken wing.

In preparation for the prom, Miyagi teaches Julie how to dance, and buys her a dress. Julie goes to the prom with Eric, but under Dugan&#x27;s orders, the Alpha Elite bungee-jump in. When one of the members breaks his arm, Eric shows concern, but Ned tells him to stay out of it.

Eric drives Julie home and kisses her. Ned follows them and smashes the windows of Eric&#x27;s car with a baseball bat. Ned challenges him to a fight at the docks, and is joined there by Dugan and the Alpha Elite. They set fire to Eric&#x27;s car and severely beat him, but he is saved by Julie and Miyagi.

Ned tries to grab Julie, but she challenges him to a fight. She holds her own, using the karate she has learned, even when Ned throws sand in her face. Julie defeats Ned and turns her back on him. Dugan bullies the rest of the group to continue the fight, but they refuse. Miyagi challenges Dugan to a fight and wins, leading the Alpha Elite to abandon him. The film concludes with Angel flying freely above the water.

===Critical reception===

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval of 7% with an average score of 3.80/10 based on 29 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; is noteworthy for giving audiences the chance to see a pre-Oscars Hilary Swank, but other than a typically solid performance from Pat Morita, this unnecessary fourth installment in the franchise has very little to offer&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 36 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<text>Smart Guy is an American sitcom television series centering on the exploits of child prodigy T.J. Henderson (Tahj Mowry), who moves from being an elementary school student in the fourth grade to a high school student in the tenth grade, attending the same school as his two elder siblings Yvette and Marcus. Created by Danny Kallis, the series ran for three seasons and 51 episodes on The WB from April 2, 1997, to May 16, 1999. The series was produced by de Passe Entertainment and Danny Kallis Productions, in association with Walt Disney Television. In an interview in September 2020, Mowry confirmed that a revival of the show was in the works.

==Overview==
Set in Washington, D.C., the show centers on the misadventures of boy genius and youngest child T.J. Henderson (Tahj Mowry), who at the age of 10 moves from elementary school and gets transferred to Piedmont High School, where he ends up becoming a high school freshman with teenagers as his classmates. He must adjust to the life with older, but not necessarily wiser, high school teenagers – including his brother Marcus (Jason Weaver) and Marcus&#x27; best friend Mo (Omar Gooding). Episodes typically deal with T.J.&#x27;s missteps of trying to fit in as a kid genius, while being a small kid in high school, as well as the contrast between his smarts and his brother&#x27;s underachieving nature.

Older brother Marcus Henderson, the sophomore underachieving middle child, also deals with teenage problems, such as finding a date and doing homework (though he sometimes tries to get T.J. to do his homework for him). Their father Floyd Henderson (John Marshall Jones), a widowed single father who owns his own roofing business, deals with the problems of raising his three kids: Yvette, Marcus and T.J., since his wife&#x27;s death. Floyd&#x27;s only daughter, and Marcus and T.J.&#x27;s older sister Yvette (Essence Atkins), usually is the level-headed member of the family – similar to Floyd in that respect – and is the typical overachieving student.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
===Main===
====T.J. Henderson====
The lead character (played by Tahj Mowry), T.J. Henderson (whose full first and middle name were not revealed) is the youngest child in his family, portrayed as 10 to 11 years old in seasons 1 and 2, and 12 in season 3. As the show&#x27;s title suggests, T.J. exhibits exceptional intelligence with an IQ of 180, knows several different languages and has a photographic memory. He skips six grades from 4th to 10th grade due to his intelligence, after his teachers at his old school discovered that T.J. was not feeling challenged enough by a 4th grade curriculum. Outside of the occasional moments of awkwardness that are bound to occur when a child interacts with high schoolers, T.J. has a peaceable existence in the school, and is eager to be involved in school functions: so much so, that he becomes the mascot for his school basketball team (&quot;Pugnacious Pete, the Powerful Piedmont Penguin&quot;), with mixed results.

T.J. is later promoted to being the equipment manager for the Piedmont High Penguins basketball team. He spends a fair amount of time at school with his older brother, Marcus, and his brother&#x27;s best friend, Mo Tibbs. Although they have some tense moments, the two brothers, who share a bedroom throughout the series, care for each other deeply. Though T.J. spends much of his time around teenagers, he is occasionally seen spending time with children his own age, which occasionally results in his attempts to try to fit in with them in situations where he feels out of place. T.J. plays keyboard for Marcus&#x27; band Mackadocious in several episodes, after one of the group&#x27;s other members breaks his finger in an accident (he also briefly served as the band&#x27;s manager in the season three episode &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot;).
====Marcus Henderson====
Played by Jason Weaver, the character of Marcus Henderson is T.J.&#x27;s older brother and the second-oldest child in the Henderson family (behind sister Yvette). He is a fairly popular student at Piedmont High and reacts remarkably well to his younger brother sharing nearly every one of his classes, although tensions do arise from time to time (this is especially true in the pilot episode, to the point where he tells T.J. that he wishes that his younger brother would disappear from his life). He gets average or below average grades, simply because he does not apply himself. He is a forward on his school&#x27;s basketball team and has several love interests throughout the run of the show, none of which are seen for more than one episode. He is also the lead vocalist for the band which he created, Mackadocious, in which his best friend Mo is the bassist and T.J. is the keyboardist.

====Tasha Yvette Henderson====
Played by Essence Atkins, the character of Tasha Yvette Henderson – who is generally referred to by her middle name – is the older sister of Marcus and T.J. and the only daughter of Floyd Henderson. She is in the eleventh grade in season one and graduates high school at the end of season three. Yvette is intelligent, is usually level-headed, is a women&#x27;s rights activist and has a passion for art, including drama, photography and dancing. She is also the editor of the school newspaper, &quot;The Penguin&quot; (a position that is the partial basis of &quot;Stop the Presses&quot;, in which T.J. decides to start his own newspaper – &quot;The Weekly Veritas&quot;, which he abruptly switches from a hard news to a tabloid publication upon the advice of Marcus and Mo due to flagging sales – after he becomes dissatisfied with repeatedly assigned by Yvette to write puff pieces). Yvette sometimes finds it hard being the only girl in a family full of mostly men, as seen in the season two episode &quot;Men Working Badly&quot;.

Episodes in which her character dates a fellow Piedmont High student feature Yvette sometimes overthinking the relationship, such as when she dated a dimwitted swimmer whom she had mainly a physical attraction to in the episode &quot;Big Picture&quot; or when high school senior Yvette dated a sophomore in the episode &quot;T.A. or Not T.A.&quot; In the season one episode &quot;The Code&quot;, it is revealed that she has a fake I.D. that says she is 28 years old. After being rejected from Princeton University, Yvette planned to stay in Washington, D.C. to attend Georgetown University as the series ends. Although the character of Yvette is in her late teens, Essence Atkins (born on February 7, 1972, and therefore being in her mid-20s during the run of the series) is actually only ten years younger than John Marshall Jones, who plays her character&#x27;s father Floyd.

====Floyd Henderson====
Played by John Marshall Jones, the character of Floyd Henderson is the strict widowed father of Yvette, Marcus, and T.J. He is a self-made businessman and owns a roofing company called Floyd Henderson Contracting. After the loss of his wife, he would eventually start dating once again: such as in season two&#x27;s &quot;Dateline&quot;, when T.J. sets Floyd up with a woman named Jamie (Jackie Mari Roberts) through an online dating service, whom T.J. eventually gets jealous of after Floyd spends less time with him; and in the season three episode &quot;Beating is Fundamental&quot;, when he dates a woman whose son T.J. dislikes (and later punches), though many of the women that he is seen dating in the series are usually not seen for more than one episode. He is frequently a comic foil to most of the main characters, including T.J. He also gives good moral advice to all of his children (and sometimes even to Mo).

====Morris L. &quot;Mo&quot; Tibbs====
Played by Omar Gooding, the character of Mo Tibbs is Marcus&#x27;s best friend. He is typically portrayed in the show as being dimwitted (such as confusing a rasher with a haberdasher) with some signs of gullibility, to the point where in the episode &quot;I Was a Teenage Sports Wife&quot;, T.J. makes Mo part of a placebo experiment by giving him sugar-filled pill capsules that T.J. claims will stimulate synapses in the brain (therefore increasing intelligence), in order to better perform on tests, only for Mo to inform other students about the pills and drowning T.J. with offers for the &quot;brain pills&quot;. Despite his heavy and muscular build, Mo is usually depicted as a friendly person (the pilot episode, however, depicts him as being almost a rival to Marcus in a few scenes, particularly one in which he gets into a fight with Marcus over their classmate Mariah (Venus DeMilo Thomas), whom they both are romantically interested in, resulting in T.J. stepping into the altercation to defend Marcus). Mo is discovered to be an excellent chef, due to the tutelage of Yvette (who helped him learn how to cook after Mo signed up for a cooking class on the spur of the moment, simply because the class was cooking bacon at the time), he plays bass guitar in Marcus&#x27; band Mackadocious, and is also a semi-talented barber.

Floyd is often annoyed with Mo&#x27;s antics, such as his constantly eating from their fridge and even once having slept in T.J.&#x27;s bed (having done so as part of a plan to help T.J. sneak out to see a friend at an arcade after being reprimanded and effectively, grounded by Floyd over his choice of clothing). Despite this, Floyd seems to genuinely care about Mo and, as seen in the episode &quot;Diary of a Mad Schoolgirl&quot;, shares with him a passion for a barbecue. Mo all but lives at the Henderson&#x27;s house and dislikes eating at his own house (having once chipped a tooth while eating oatmeal cooked by his mother, as he notes in the opening scene of &quot;Get a Job&quot;). In the season three episode &quot;That&#x27;s My Momma&quot;, Mo accidentally overhears a conversation between his parents Delroy and Verla Mae that they had adopted him as a baby, this leads him to have a falling out with his parents and Marcus and T.J. helping him find his birth mother who is revealed to be a fortune teller in Delaware named Shelia Ecks. A recurring catchphrase of his throughout the series is, &quot;Hello der!&quot; (&quot;hello there&quot;).

===Recurring===
* Nina Walsh – Played by Tinsley Grimes, Nina is one of Yvette&#x27;s friends and is seen with her most of the time, however she is only seen during the third season (Yvette had a revolving door of friends up through that point). She works at the store in the mall, where in the episode &quot;Get A Job&quot;, she was forced to follow black people because her boss Ms. Hendra explained that African-Americans who were in the store would steal. She is deep and poetic and drools over handsome men.
* Deion Lamont White – Played by Arvie Lowe, Jr., Deion is a teenager who attends Piedmont High. His usual hijinks include taking pictures of Marcus and Mo and selling them to a company for profit (in the season two episode &quot;My Two Dads&quot;), and scamming Marcus and Mo into selling health bars in a pyramid scheme which he involves every other student in school to sell them as well (in the season two episode &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chimps&quot;), among other things (Marcus refers to him as &quot;a little shrimp&quot;). In the season two episode &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, Deion had a crush (more like an obsession) on Yvette and asked her out to the school dance, which Yvette rejects repeatedly (and prompts her to go with T.J.&#x27;s plan to make Deion think that she is dating Mo).
* Mackey Nagle – Played by J.D. Walsh, Mackey is a student who is in Marcus and Mo&#x27;s grade. He is fairly popular and is definitely not the sharpest knife in the drawer. He tries to fit in at school by buying new clothes and speaking slang, but most of the time makes a fool of himself and ends with a comment stating &quot;It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m white, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; (which is usually replied with nods by everyone who was listening, this particular gag was only seen in the season two episode &quot;Sit In (a.k.a. Dawgburger Rebellion)&quot;). In the season three episode &quot;Perchance to Dream&quot;, he has a dream about Yvette kissing him as she tells him about her dreams about Mo. He often wears flannel shirts. He actually ends up streaking during the graduation ceremony in the season three episode &quot;The Graduate?&quot; (after T.J.&#x27;s plan of a revenge prank on the Seniors backfires). Originally he was depicted as a bully who harassed T.J. and then Clark.
* Basil Militich – Played by James K. Ward, he is the vice principal of the school. He is cheap when it comes to school necessities, For some reasons, he is presented as incompetent.
* Coach Gerber – Played by Dann Florek, he is the gym teacher and basketball coach at the school. He is bald and aging and went through a divorce (which includes paying $800 in alimony to his wife monthly). He once taught math and gets angry easily. He sleeps in his office since he cannot afford a home of his own. He once mentioned that he has prostate issues (citation?)
* Brandi Andréa Dixon – Played by Kyla Pratt, Brandi is a girl around T.J.&#x27;s age, and met T.J. at the arcade in the season two episode &quot;Bad Boy&quot;. She is very good at basketball and joined the team T.J. plays on in the season three episode &quot;She Got Game&quot;, but she stopped playing due to T.J. being upset with her when she begins starting and T.J. is benched. She wears &quot;ghetto fabulous&quot; clothing and depicts a youthful exaggerated stereotype. They have crushes on each other, but it is not focused on. Brandi only appears in two episodes: &quot;Bad Boy&quot; in season two, and &quot;She Got Game&quot; in season three (though Pratt previously appeared in season one as Lillie, one of T.J.&#x27;s three prom dates in the episode &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s You and You and You&quot;).
* Sarina – Played by Nakia Burrise, is one of the participants in Tasha Yvette Henderson&#x27;s self defense class who goes on a date with Morris L. &#x27;Mo&#x27; Tibbs

==Production==
Tahj Mowry and Omar Gooding are the only main cast members that did not appear in every episode. Tahj Mowry did not appear in the season 3 episode &quot;Get a Job&quot; and Omar Gooding in &quot;A Little Knowledge.&quot; Jason Weaver, Essence Atkins and John Marshall Jones are the only cast members to appear in every episode.

The series was taped at Sunset-Gower Studios in Hollywood. The establishing shot of the fictional Piedmont High School later appeared on another Washington, D.C.–based Disney series, &quot;Cory in the House&quot; for the Disney Channel, and also as the establishing shot for John Adams High on the ABC series &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;.

===Main settings===

====The Henderson house====
A majority of the show&#x27;s scenes take place in the Henderson house or the school. Originally, most of the family scenes took place in the kitchen, with the lack of living room area seen during the first season. The living room set when it was added in season two had a window and the front door at stage center, and the stairs and kitchen doorway at stage right. The kitchen set was scaled back as well with the back stairs that lead to the bedrooms removed. The layout changed again in season three with the kitchen remaining the same, but the living room layout changes including the front door now located at stage left. Marcus and T.J.&#x27;s bedroom is the only set to remain the same during the course of the entire series.

====Piedmont High School====
Piedmont High is the high school that Yvette, Marcus, Mo and T.J. attend. The four main sets seen in the show are the classroom, the hallway, the cafeteria and the auditorium. The hallway changes its layout twice during the series.

===Theme song and opening sequences===
The theme song for the first and second seasons was produced and written by Kristian Rex who also composed the music for the entire second season. The theme song for &quot;Smart Guys&quot;&#x27; third and final one was performed by Hami and featured cast member Omar Gooding. A short version of the season three theme, which is different from the regular theme song was used in episodes in which ran over the allotted time.

The opening sequence for the first two seasons was fully computer-animated with the exception of the cast video headshots. The show&#x27;s title logo was shown at the beginning and again at the end of the sequence when the main characters without Mo are shown above it. The season three opening titles were made to resemble a music video (the sequence was choreographed by Russell Clark).

===Video on demand===
The entire series (except for the episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Do That Thing You Do&quot;) is available to stream on Disney+ as of its launch date of November 12, 2019.

==Syndication==
After the end of its running on The WB, the series was rerun on Disney Channel from 1999 to 2004. It was also shown on other networks such as BET, ABC Family, Up TV, and MTV2. In other countries, it is also shown on the international versions of Disney Channel. In Canada, the show ran on Family Channel from 2002 to 2008.

<text>The Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line (numbered T4, coloured azure blue) is a commuter railway line on the Sydney Trains network in the eastern and southern suburbs of Sydney. The line was constructed in the 1880s to Wollongong to take advantage of agricultural and mining potentials in the Illawarra area. In March 1926, it became the first railway in New South Wales to run electric train services.

Today, the railway consists of three connected lines: 
*The original Illawarra line from the Sydney CBD to Waterfall
*The Cronulla line from Sutherland to Cronulla, which opened in 1939 replacing an earlier tram service
*The Eastern Suburbs line from the Sydney CBD to Bondi Junction, which opened in 1979

Operationally and historically, the entire line from the Illawarra Junction at Redfern to its terminus in Bomaderry on the South Coast was known as the &quot;Illawarra Line&quot;. However, since 1989, the suburban services to Waterfall and Cronulla have been marketed as the &quot;Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line&quot; and interurban services south to Wollongong and Bomaderry as the &quot;South Coast Line&quot;. The line is coloured an azure blue on Sydney Trains timetables and other promotional materials.

==Alignment==

===Eastern Suburbs Line===

The Eastern Suburbs Line runs between Bondi Junction in Sydney&#x27;s east and Eveleigh, just south of the Sydney central business district. It is mostly underground, and consists of of bored tunnels and of cut and cover tunnels, with only above ground. In the Eastern Suburbs, three tunnels proceed in a westerly direction from Bondi Junction via Edgecliff and Kings Cross; in each of these tunnels there are stations. Between Bondi Junction and Edgecliff, there is a short open-air cutting in Woollahra, and between Edgecliff and Kings Cross, there is a short viaduct over Rushcutters Bay.

From Kings Cross, the line proceeds west towards the Sydney Central Business District on a viaduct that passes over the suburb of Woolloomooloo and the Eastern Distributor. The line then passes into a tunnel underneath the Art Gallery of New South Wales to a station underneath Martin Place. Turning south, the line proceeds through Town Hall, Central and Redfern stations, before emerging behind the Eveleigh Railway Workshops. The line is double track throughout, with turnback sidings at Martin Place and Bondi Junction for citybound trains, and at Central for trains from Bondi Junction.

===Illawarra &amp; Cronulla Lines===
The Illawarra Line commences at Illawarra Junction at Redfern and travels on the &#x27;Illawarra&#x27; (eastern pair) tracks. A dive tunnel allows Intercity services from the South Coast Line to cross underneath the main suburban lines to access Central station. The Illawarra lines are also connected at this point to the &quot;Illawarra Relief Lines&quot; which emerge from underground and lead to the Eastern Suburbs Line.

From Illawarra Junction, four tracks head south through Erskineville and St Peters to Sydenham station. The &#x27;main&#x27; pair of tracks are used by Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line and South Coast Line trains and the &#x27;local&#x27; pair by Airport &amp; South Line trains. The Airport &amp; South Line trains continue along the Illawarra line until diverging onto the East Hills line around Wolli Creek. South of Wolli Creek station, a crossover allows trains from the &#x27;main&#x27; pair of tracks to switch to the &#x27;local&#x27; pair. This is used by peak hour all-stations Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line trains. The four track section ends at Hurstville. The line then continues as two tracks south towards Sutherland, crossing the Georges River via the Como railway bridge between Oatley and Como. At Sutherland the Cronulla line branches in an easterly direction. This line is double track throughout.

The main line then heads in a southerly direction, parallel to the Princes Highway to the west and bordering the Royal National Park on its eastern side until Waterfall, the last suburb in the Sydney metropolitan area. The track continues south from here as the South Coast Line through the Royal National Park towards the Illawarra region.

==History==

===Main line construction===
The Illawarra line route was approved by the New South Wales Government in 1880. This route originated near the inner-city locality of Macdonaldtown and ran to Kiama via the locality of &quot;Bottle Forest&quot;, a distance of . The route selected comprises the present-day route of the Macdonaldtown to Waterfall section of the Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line. On 6 April 1881, Governor Augustus Loftus assented to Act 44 Vic. No. 28, which provided £1,020,000 for the construction of this railway, and proposed that the first section of , constituting approximately the present suburban route, be completed by 30 September 1884. Almost immediately, concerns were raised about the new route&#x27;s viability, most specifically over the cost of tunnelling between Waterfall and Otford to reach Wollongong. Work was suspended past the point at Como, and Government surveyors were instructed to re-survey a route via the Port Hacking River that had originally been surveyed in 1873. Their work allayed concerns about the new route: although the new route had more tunnelling, excavation and sharp curves, the total cost of the &quot;Bottle Forest&quot; route was estimated at £130,175 less than the original Port Hacking route. The Minister for Works eventually agreed on this new route, although construction was again briefly halted when the contractors refused to recommence work on the disputed section. With new contractors hired, the line was complete to Hurstville by 15 October 1884, Waterfall by 9 March 1886, and the whole line to Kiama was opened officially in Wollongong on 22 June 1887.

According to the official papers on the line&#x27;s construction, when the line first opened for trains between Sydney and Sutherland construction was not quite complete, so excursion services initially ran on weekends only until the entire line was handed over. The first official train ran within the modern-day suburban area on 9 December 1885, although the line was closed once again between December 1885 and January 1886 to permit testing on the new bridge over the Georges River.

===Amplification and electrification===
The line was originally constructed as double track between Illawarra Junction and Hurstville with single track thereafter; however, its rising use meant that the line required duplication soon afterwards. The line was duplicated between Hurstville and Loftus Station (with the exception of the Como bridge over the Georges River) in April 1890, then southward to Waterfall by 12 December 1890. The section of track between Illawarra Junction and Hurstville was quadruplicated between 1913 and 1925.

After duplication in 1890, the original lattice-girder Como Bridge across the Georges River was laid as gauntlet track. This arrangement remained in place for many decades, causing a notorious bottleneck on the line, until the New South Wales Government commissioned John Holland &amp; Co to build a new bridge in 1969. Construction of the new bridge, made of prestressed concrete box girders, commenced in 1969 and was first used by the 18:17 service from Como on 19 November 1972. The old bridge, as well as a former alignment of the line between Mortdale and Oatley replaced in 1905, is now used as a rail trail for pedestrians and cyclists.

The Illawarra Line was the first railway electrified in New South Wales, and was built in conjunction with the construction of the &quot;City Railway&quot; between Central and St James, opening on 1 March 1926, a few months before the line was connected to the new underground railway. By November 1926 the electric overhead had passed Sutherland and continued to the branch line constructed to the Royal National Park. The line between Loftus and Waterfall remained unelectrified until 1980 and was serviced by steam and then diesel railcars.

===Cronulla branch line===
A single track tramway line, with four stations and a goods siding, was opened on 12 June 1911 at a cost of £37,505. The route commenced at the southern end of Sutherland station, proceeded north-east to the Princes Highway, east along the Kingsway, then south past the site of the present rail terminus to Shelly Park in the centre of Cronulla.

By 1932, the Cronulla tramway had closed. Competing bus services had begun to run with unrestricted competition, and the tram line by this time was so full with services that trams often ran late due to holdups at the crossing loops and passengers missed their connections at Sutherland. The line suffered large losses in its later years, and the effect of the Great Depression at the time forced it to cease its services, the last passenger service operating on 3 August 1931. The goods service continued until 12 January of the next year.

Although the closure of the tramway allowed planning to go ahead for a railway, the planning for the replacement railway line suffered various delays in the 1930s due to funding issues: the line&#x27;s construction competed with a proposal to electrify the Illawarra Line to Waterfall, and there were disputes over the point at which the line would connect to the main line. Two early proposals to join the line at Como and north of Sutherland Station were rejected. Despite the delays, Parliament finally gave approval to the line on 2 March 1936, and a route with five new stations was surveyed that would connect with the main line at the southern side of Sutherland station. The new line was opened on 16 December 1939.

Although a crossing loop was installed at Caringbah Station and Gymea Station when the line was opened, the single track line prevented the expansion of services to the Cronulla peninsula, and so in the 1980s, it was decided to duplicate a section of the line between Gymea and Caringbah, with Gymea, Miranda and Caringbah all receiving island platforms. The new section was opened on 15 July 1985. In the 2000s, the remaining single track sections were duplicated. These opened on 19 April 2010.

===Eastern Suburbs Railway===
In 1916, a plan for the city railways, and an Eastern Suburbs extension was drawn up by the Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Railway Construction, John Bradfield. It was given subsequent approval by Parliament. Bradfield&#x27;s plan entailed building a City Circle loop, with an extension through to the Eastern Suburbs by means of a viaduct over Woolloomooloo. The line was to extend to Rosebery and Waterloo, with ten stations, linking with the Illawarra Line near Erskineville station.

Upon the passing of the &quot;City and Suburban Electric Railways (Amendment) Act&quot; in 1947, construction finally commenced on a variation of the Bradfield&#x27;s proposal. Two lines would be built: one proceeding on a viaduct out to Kings Cross, then eventually to Bondi Beach. Another line would head from St James via Taylor Square and the Sydney Cricket Ground, extending to Kingsford, with a proposal to extend from Taylor Square to Coogee. Construction commenced on sites around Central station but ceased in 1952 due to a recession. Work remained abandoned for over a decade.

In 1967, construction again commenced on yet another variation on Bradfield&#x27;s design. This involved the earlier route used towards Bondi Junction through Woolloomooloo, then an extension towards Kingsford with five extra stations at Charing Cross, Frenchmans Road, Randwick, University and Kingsford. The New South Wales Government awarded the contract for the civil and structural design to the successful Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. An official Legislative Assembly inquiry in 1976, however, recommended that costs on the project be cut, and the extension to Kingsford, a proposed station at Woollahra, and the expansion of concourse areas at Bondi Junction and Martin Place stations did not proceed. Nonetheless, it was resolved to fully integrate the railway with the Illawarra line. The Eastern Suburbs Railway opened between Central station and Bondi Junction on 23 June 1979. Initially, trains ran as shuttle services between Central and Bondi Junction; it was not until a year later that work was finished to integrate the lines. A double-track junction with the Illawarra Line at Erskineville south of Illawarra Junction, twin single track tunnels connecting to the Eastern Suburbs Railway platforms at Central, a set of underground platforms at Redfern and a turnback tunnel at Martin Place opened to complete the project on 20 July 1980.

Bondi Junction had originally been intended only as an intermediate turnback station before the extension to Kingsford was abandoned. As part of the Rail Clearways Program, the $77 million Bondi Junction Turnback project saw a new rail crossover was built between the single-track tunnels, enabling 20 trains an hour, up from 14, to use the station. The work was completed in time for the introduction of a new timetable on 28 May 2006.

==Operation==

===Trains===
In addition to Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line trains, the Illawarra railway line carries interurban and freight traffic. The Cronulla branch line and the Eastern Suburbs Railway are exclusively used by passenger trains.

Historically, passenger services were provided to the Sydney Central by steam locomotives. The first services to Hurstville were run by steam locomotives of the Q.158 and R.285 classes. When the City Underground opened to St James in 1926, a new electric service was provided to run there. From the time when the line to the Royal National Park was electrified, passengers received a steam train service at first, then when this became expensive, it was replaced by a rail motor service. This arrangement continued until the line was electrified to Waterfall, and the Eastern Suburbs Line was opened. In 1979, the Eastern Suburbs Line being the first line to only use S set double-decker rolling stock. The current running operations for passenger services have remained generally unchanged since 1981 with the integration of the Illawarra line and the Eastern Suburbs Railway. Suburban services utilise Erskineville Junction and proceed to Central and Bondi Junction.

The last S sets were withdrawn from Mortdale Maintenance Depot in March 2013; all services now provided by Tangara and OSCAR sets (as the infrastructure and electrical requirements of newer models are incompatible with the line). Trains typically operate with 12 services per hour in peak, six services per hour in off-peak, and four to six services per hour on weekends and public holidays.

===Map===
===Stations===
The line currently has 33 operating stations. Only three stations or platforms have closed, the two stations on the Royal National Park Branch (the main station, which closed in 1991, and the platform for the Scout&#x27;s Camp, which closed in 1947), and the station on the Woronora Cemetery branch, which also closed in 1947.

===Stopping patterns===
The stopping patterns on the Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line have generally been determined by several different termini. The steam era saw these termini change quite frequently as more terminating facilities were constructed: the first trains on the line after the Waterfall extension in 1887 either ran to Hurstville (16 per day), Sutherland (two per day) and Waterfall (two per day), with all trains stopping at every intermediate station. By 1907, however, Como and Oatley had been added to the list of termini, with nine and seven trains per day respectively. Seven trains per day at this time also ran to Sutherland, and one to Waterfall. Most trains terminated at Hurstville.

Since electrification, the terminus stations for suburban trains have remained consistent. From 1926 trains terminated at either Hurstville, Sutherland and The National Park. With the opening of the Cronulla branch in 1939, Cronulla become the fourth major terminus. In 1980 Waterfall was electrified and replaced The Royal National Park as a terminus, having been served by a diesel-operated shuttle service until then.

===Patronage===
The following table shows the patronage of Sydney Trains network for the year ending 30 June 2024.

==Performance==

In 2009–2010, 97.65% of all Eastern Suburbs and Illawarra services ran on-time, ranking it the most reliable line on the CityRail network. In the 2019–2020 financial year, this figure was 95.2%.

Planning experts recognised a need to expand capacity on the Eastern Suburbs Line. In 2002, former CityRail chairman Ron Christie released a report, the &quot;Long-term strategic plan for rail&quot;, which outlined the critical infrastructure that would need to be built between then and 2050 to ensure the long-term survival and operation of the CityRail network. The report highlighted the problems facing the network at that time and noted that capacity on Illawarra Line trains was often at 120%, and that 180% was not unexpected. Christie said that by 2011 there would be no capacity on the Eastern Suburbs Line for trains coming from the Illawarra Line. To address this, the NSW Government constructed the Bondi Junction Turnback, which enables an additional six trains per hour to terminate at the station. To take advantage of the new infrastructure, a new timetable was introduced in May 2006 which reduced the overcrowding.

A second project, the full duplication of the Cronulla branch line, was completed in 2010. This increases the capacity of the branch line from four to eight trains per hour. The line between Oatley, Sutherland and Cronulla also received signalling upgrades to allow more services to run at shorter intervals. A new timetable with extra services was introduced on 10 October 2010.

It was proposed in the 2007 NSW State Plan that by 2017, the line capacity between Hurstville and Sutherland will be amplified to allow extra services to and from Cronulla, as well as for services accessing the Mortdale Maintenance Centre. The 2010 Metropolitan Transport Plan made no mention of the project. As of 2021, this project had not taken place but in August 2020, the New South Wales Government had announced an alternative project, the installation of a new rail crossover at Hurstville that would enable 20% more services in peak hour. The crossover project is planned to be completed by 2022.

==Metro/light rail proposals==
Over the years, there have been a number of proposals to replace/supplement all/part of the Illawarra line with metro/light rail services. None of these have eventuated, as of 2023.

*Co-ordinator General of the state&#x27;s rail industry Ron Christie&#x27;s &quot;Long-term strategic plan for rail&quot; report issued in 2001, suggested that several &quot;metro&quot; lines be built to service new areas and to relieve capacity on existing lines. These included a metro line to supplement the Illawarra Line. The route would go from Cronulla to Miranda along the existing tracks, then along a reserved corridor for the F6 Southern Freeway up to Sydney Airport. The line would then extend to the Sydney CBD then to Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches via Chatswood. Christie suggested that even if the entire line were not to be built, the first stage between Cronulla, the Airport and the City would provide &quot;essential capacity relief&quot; for the Illawarra line which would be &quot;severely capacity-constrained&quot; within two decades. Both heavy rail and light rail were mooted as alternatives.
*Christie was not the only person to suggest the F6 Corridor as an alternative. In 2002, the then Minister for Transport Carl Scully officially abandoned the corridor, reserved since 1951 for the extension of the Southern Freeway north to St Peters, and suggested that light rail, bus-only roads or high-frequency train services could run on the corridor. He wished to encourage innovative public transport solutions in the area, while maintaining the green space available near Botany Bay. The plan received support from environmental groups, with environmental transport group EcoTransit proposing their own light rail line to supplement the Illawarra Line on the reservation, called the &quot;Bay Light Express&quot;.
*Since 2005, however, the future of an alternative corridor was in doubt, with the then State Treasurer Michael Costa announcing that the corridor would again be reserved for a motorway. By 2019, construction of the first stage of the M6 Motorway had been approved for part of the corridor, between Arncliffe and Kogarah.
*In 2012 when the new Sydney Metro Northwest was announced, it was proposed that at a later date the line would be extended across Sydney Harbour and then split between and on the Illawarra line. However subsequent plans no longer mention the Illawarra Line.

<doc id="657815" wikidata="Q5170874" url="?curid=657815" title="Corktown, Toronto">
<text>Corktown is an older residential neighbourhood in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The neighbourhood is south of Shuter Street, north of the Gardiner Expressway, east of Parliament Street, and west of Don River to the east. Corktown contains many vacated industrial buildings, some now used for movie production, and others repurposed for studios and shops. The West Don Lands development is in the south-east corner of this area.

== Toponymy ==
The neighbourhood&#x27;s name originated in the early 19th-century, when the area was an enclave of Irish immigrants, both Protestant and Catholic, said to be primarily from County Cork.

== History ==

In the 19th century, most Corktown residents found employment at one of the local breweries or brickyards. Some of the original workers&#x27; cottages can still be seen in the area. Examples of late 19th-century British-style row-housing can still be seen lining Corktown side streets such as Bright Street, Trinity Street, Wilkins Avenue, Ashby Place and Gilead Place.

The first Roman Catholic church in Toronto, St. Paul&#x27;s Basilica, is found in Corktown. St. Paul&#x27;s was originally built in 1822. The current St. Paul&#x27;s (at Queen St. East and Power Street) dates from 1887. St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic School is the oldest Catholic elementary school in the city, founded in 1842. Beneath its schoolyard and adjacent to St. Paul&#x27;s Basilica is an unmarked graveyard which served the Catholic community until 1857.

Protestants could not afford the lofty pew rents at nearby St. James Cathedral (Anglican) and this led to the building of their own Little Trinity Anglican Church in 1843 on King Street East. Little Trinity Church is Toronto&#x27;s oldest surviving church building, its cornerstone laid on July 20, 1843.

The Enoch Turner School on Trinity Street, was built in 1848. This was Toronto&#x27;s first &#x27;free school&#x27;. Its eponymous benefactor was Enoch Turner, a prominent Corktown brewer and one of Toronto&#x27;s great philanthropists. The Schoolhouse is now operated as a museum by the Ontario Heritage Trust, offering tours for adults and children and hosting private events. Corktown is also home to Inglenook Community High School on Sackville Street, one of the Toronto District School Board&#x27;s alternative schools. Its building dates to 1887.

In the early 1960s, a significant amount of Corktown was demolished to make way for several elevated roadways, including the Richmond Street off-ramp from the Don Valley Parkway and the re-routed Eastern Avenue overpass. Among the most significant buildings destroyed was the House of Providence (1857–1962), an institution run by the Sisters of St. Joseph to care for orphans and the elderly poor.

In 2031, the under-construction Ontario Line will open and provide an underground light metro station named Corktown to serve the neighborhood.

<text>Barcelona is a 1994 American romantic comedy-drama film written, produced, and directed by Whit Stillman. Set in Barcelona, the film stars Taylor Nichols, Chris Eigeman, and Mira Sorvino.

&quot;Barcelona&quot; is the second film — after &quot;Metropolitan&quot; (1990) and preceding &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; (1998) — in what Stillman calls his &quot;Doomed Bourgeois in Love&quot; series. The three films are independent of each other except for the cameo appearances of some common characters.

==Premise==
In 1987, Ted Boynton is a Chicago salesman living and working in Barcelona. Ted&#x27;s cousin, Fred, a naval officer, unexpectedly comes to stay with Ted. Fred has been sent to Barcelona to handle public relations on behalf of a U.S. fleet scheduled to arrive later.

The cousins have a history of conflict since childhood. Ted and Fred develop relationships with various single women in Barcelona and experience the negative reactions of some of the community&#x27;s residents to the context of Fred&#x27;s presence. Ted also faces possible problems with his American employer and with the concept of attraction to physical beauty.

==Cast==

<text>Robert Bruce Mathias (November 17, 1930 – September 2, 2006) was an American decathlete, politician, and actor. Representing the United States, he won two Olympic gold medals in the Decathlon, at the 1948 and the 1952 Summer Games. As a Republican, he served in the US House of Representatives for California&#x27;s 18th congressional district, for four terms from 1967 to 1975.

==Early life and athletic career==
Mathias was born in Tulare, California, to a family with partial Greek lineage. He attended Tulare Union High School, where he was a classmate and long time friend of Sim Iness, the 1952 Olympic discus gold medalist. While at Tulare Union in early 1948, Mathias took up the decathlon at the suggestion of his track coach, Virgil Jackson. During the summer following his high school graduation, he qualified for the United States Olympic team for the 1948 Summer Olympics held in London.

In the Olympics, Mathias&#x27;s naïveté about the decathlon was exposed. He was unaware of the rules in the shot put and nearly fouled out of the event. He almost failed in the high jump but was able to recover. Mathias overcame his difficulties and with superior pole vault and javelin scores was able to push past Ignace Heinrich to win the Olympic gold medal. At age 17, he became the youngest gold medalist in a track and field event.

Mathias continued to succeed in decathlons in the four years between the London games and the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. In 1948, Mathias won the James E. Sullivan Award as the nation&#x27;s top amateur athlete, but because his scholastic record in high school did not match his athletic achievement, he spent a year at The Kiski School, a well-respected all-boys boarding school in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania. He then entered Stanford University in 1949, played college football for two years and was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. Mathias set his first decathlon world record in 1950 and led Stanford to a Rose Bowl appearance in 1952, the first nationally televised college football game.

After graduating from Stanford in 1953 with a BA in Education, Mathias spent two and a half years in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was promoted to the rank of captain and was honorably discharged.

At Helsinki in 1952, Mathias established himself as one of the world&#x27;s greatest all-around athletes. He won the decathlon by the astounding margin of 912 points, which established a new world record, and he became the first person to successfully defend an Olympic decathlon title. He returned to the United States as a national hero. His 7,887 point total at the Helsinki Olympics remained the school record at Stanford for 63 years until it was broken in 2015 by a freshman, Harrison Williams. In 1952, he was the first person to compete in an Olympics and a Rose Bowl the same year.

After the 1952 Olympics, Mathias retired from athletic competition. He later became the first director of the United States Olympic Training Center, a post he held from 1977 to 1983.

He and his wife Melba can be seen on the edition of April 29, 1954, of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. During the discussion he mentions a forthcoming film in which the couple played themselves, called &quot;The Bob Mathias Story&quot;. He also starred in a number of mostly cameo-type roles in a variety of movies and TV shows throughout the 1950s. In the 1959–1960 television season, Mathias played Frank Dugan, with costars Keenan Wynn as Kodiak and Chet Allen as Slats, in the TV series &quot;The Troubleshooters&quot;, which featured 26 episodes on events at construction sites. In 1960, he also appeared as an athletic Theseus in an Italian &quot;peplum,&quot; or sword-and-sandal, film: Minotaur, the Wild Beast of Crete.

==Political career==
Between 1967 and 1975, Mathias served four terms in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican, representing the northern San Joaquin Valley of California. (These were the same eight years in which Ronald Reagan served two terms as governor of California.) He defeated Harlan Hagen, the 14-year Democratic Party incumbent, by about 11% in the 1966 election. This was not too surprising because this area started to move away from its New Deal Democratic roots. But, like most Republicans and Democrats from California, he continued his predecessor&#x27;s support of Civil Rights by voting in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

Mathias was re-elected three times without serious difficulty, but in 1974, his Congressional district was significantly redrawn in a mid-decade state redistricting plan. Renumbered as the 17th, Mathias&#x27;s district acquired a large section of Fresno while losing several rural areas. Mathias was narrowly defeated for re-election by John Hans Krebs, a member of the Fresno County Board of Supervisors. Mathias was one of several Republicans swept out of office in the wake of the Watergate scandal.

From June to August 1975, Mathias served as the deputy director of the Selective Service. Mathias was also a regional director in the unsuccessful 1976 presidential election campaign of Gerald Ford.

==Death==
Bob Mathias was diagnosed with cancer in 1996, and died from it in Fresno, California on September 2, 2006, at age 75. He is interred at Tulare Cemetery in Tulare, California. He was survived by wife Gwen, daughters Romel, Megan, Marissa, stepdaughter Alyse Alexander, son Reiner, brothers Eugene and Jim, and sister Patricia Guerrero.

<doc id="657832" wikidata="Q1161822" url="?curid=657832" title="My So-Called Life">
<text>My So-Called Life is an American teen drama television series created by Winnie Holzman and produced by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz. It aired on ABC from August 25, 1994 to January 26, 1995. It is distributed by The Bedford Falls Company with ABC Productions.
Set at the fictional Liberty High School in a fictional suburb near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, called Three Rivers, it follows the emotional travails of several teenagers in the social circle of main character Angela Chase, played by Claire Danes.

The show was officially canceled on May 15, 1995, despite being critically praised for its realistic portrayal of adolescence and the commentary of its central character Angela, and the series&#x27; reception of several major awards, which included a Golden Globe Award for Danes. Besides Danes, the show also launched the careers of several other major actors of her generation, including Jared Leto and Wilson Cruz. The show became a cult classic and has been frequently cited by multiple publications including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;TV Guide, The Atlantic&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the best teen dramas of all time.

== Premise ==
Angela Chase (Claire Danes) is a 15-year-old high school student who lives in the fictional Pittsburgh suburb of Three Rivers with her mother Patty (Bess Armstrong), father Graham (Tom Irwin), and little sister Danielle (Lisa Wilhoit). Each episode, which is usually narrated by Angela, follows her trials and tribulations as she deals with friends, parents, guys, and school.

==Themes==
&quot;My So-Called Life&quot; dealt with major social issues of the mid-1990s, including child abuse, homophobia, teenage alcoholism, homelessness, adultery, school violence, censorship, and drug use. Many shows at the time used these themes as a one-time issue (a &quot;very special episode&quot;) that was introduced as a problem at the beginning of an episode and resolved at the end, but on &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; these issues were part of the continuing storyline. The title of the show alludes to the perception of meaninglessness that many teenagers experience and encapsulates the main theme of the series. The show depicts the teenage years as being difficult and confusing rather than a light, fun-filled time.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
Marshall Herskovitz was approached by Showtime in the 1980s to write a show about teenagers. Herskovitz conceived of the series as a &quot;very personal, very internal&quot; story about a boy with the title &quot;Secret/Seventeen&quot;, but it was not picked up by the network. A few years later, after the cancellation of &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; in 1991, Herskovitz and his co-creator Edward Zwick approached Winnie Holzman, a writer on &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; and &quot;The Wonder Years,&quot; to brainstorm a new show. Holzman sparked to the idea of an &quot;uncensored&quot; depiction of teenage life. Said Herskovitz, &quot;Most shows about teens on television [in the early &#x27;90s, like &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; were very exploitative about sexuality and meant to be titillating rather than inside the experience of what it meant to be an adolescent.&quot;   

To capture contemporary adolescence authentically, Holzman did research and taught classes at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles for a few days. She also kept a diary and wrote down journal entries from the perspective of a teenage girl. These journal entries would later become the basis for Angela&#x27;s voice-overs.

Holzman named the title character Angela after the niece of a script coordinator on &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;. Holzman recounted, &quot;She mentioned to me she had a young teenage niece named Angela. I had a phone conversation with [Angela] and it really affected me. I remember she said something like, &#x27;Boys just have it so easy.&#x27; And that&#x27;s in the pilot. So I named the character Angela partly in honor of her.&quot;

Intent on dismantling stereotypical portrayals of teens and parents on TV, Holzman wrote Patty Chase, the wife and mother character, as the breadwinner of the Chase family and husband Graham as the homebody. Holzman portrayed the parents as in the &quot;midst of establishing their identities and discovering their incompatibility with traditional domestic tropes.&quot;

=== Casting ===
In keeping with their desire to portray adolescence authentically, producers looked for actors who were close in age to their teen characters.  Before Claire Danes was cast, Alicia Silverstone auditioned for the role of Angela and impressed Zwick, and as an emancipated minor could work longer hours, but was not deemed the right fit for &quot;Holzman’s messy high-school universe, which included subplots about drug addiction, bullying, binge drinking, promiscuity, and homosexuality.&quot; Herskovitz said, &quot;We needed somebody who shimmered between beauty and sort of not formed yet. And in walks Claire. She read the scene in the pilot where she has a confrontation with her childhood best friend. There was a direction that said, &#x27;Angela starts to tear up.&#x27; Claire gets to the moment. Her whole face turns red. She&#x27;s having this intense emotional experience — and then pulls it back. Everybody was just knocked out.&quot; As Danes was 15 and had to attend school alongside filming, producers ended up increasing the screen time for the parental characters to accommodate for Danes.

Wilson Cruz was cast as Rickie Vasquez, who was written in the script as &quot;half black, half Puerto Rican, sexually ambiguous like Jodie Foster in &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;&quot;. The character of Rickie was inspired by Holzman&#x27;s peers as a teenager, as well as by the 1990 documentary &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot;, which explores ball culture in New York City. Cruz drew on some of his own experiences, such as a period of homelessness after he came out to his dad, for his portrayal of Rickie.

Jared Leto was supposed to appear in just the pilot episode, but his acting and chemistry with Danes impressed producers and he was upgraded to the main cast.

=== Filming ===
The pilot was shot in April 1993. An enthusiastic response from ABC executives and TV critics raised producers&#x27; hopes for a series debut in the 1993-1994 TV season lineup; however, ABC delayed &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;’s addition as they pondered over the right time slot for the show. The show finally premiered in the Thursday night lineup in August 1994, a year and a half after the filming of the pilot.

The series was filmed in the Los Angeles area. Scenes at the fictional Liberty High School were shot on location at University High School.

Due to the show&#x27;s rapid shooting schedule and the uncertainty of its future, producers &quot;did not have the luxury of planning out the season&#x27;s arc in advance,&quot; and story lines would unfold episode to episode. Network executives did give the show&#x27;s creators relatively free rein to explore what were then seen as risky subjects for network TV, such as teen sexuality and orientation.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Upon its debut, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; received critical acclaim. Critic Joyce Millman said the show &quot;evokes the emotional turbulence of adolescence with breathtaking accuracy&quot; and is also &quot;unusually perceptive in its portrayal of the push and pull of mother-daughter relationships.&quot; Millman added the show has an interesting take on &quot;midlife crisis and marital boredom&quot;, and concluded &quot;with bittersweet clarity, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; shows us that teen angst is something we never outgrow.&quot;

The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; called it &quot;one of the most humanizing hours of television to come along in decades.&quot; Steven Spielberg lauded the show and called Danes &quot;one of the most exciting actresses to debut in 10 years&quot;, likening her to Audrey Hepburn.

In a critical review, Howard Rosenberg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found the teen characters grating and the plot lines to be too neatly resolved, but did praise Holzman&#x27;s writing and Danes&#x27; acting. Rosenberg wrote, &quot;you also recognize that Holzman has a witty grasp on adolescence and knows a bull’s-eye when she sees one...Another plus is the brooding self-consciousness that seems so genuine in Angela, a credit to Danes’ effortless performance. Her nervous body language speaks volumes, as do her character&#x27;s private thoughts, delivered as part of a voice-over narration in the manner of &quot;&#x27;The Wonder Years&quot;.&#x27;&quot;

After the series&#x27; cancellation and over the years, the series continued to gain acclaim for its realism and is praised by some critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, Season 1 has a 94% approval rating based on 53 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Effectively avoiding cliche and cheesy exposition, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;″s realistic portrayal of the average American girl is ahead of its time&quot;. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating, the show has a score of 92 out of 100 based on 19 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. It is the 20th highest rated television series on the website. In 2007, it was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-&quot;TIME&quot;&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; critic James Poniewozik wrote,

In 2008, AOL TV named &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; as the second Best School Show of All Time. It was number 33 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s &quot;New Classics TV&quot; list of shows from 1983 to 2008, and as number 8 in the &quot;25 Greatest Cult TV Shows Ever&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the series number 16 on its 25 Top Cult Shows Ever list in 2004, as well as number 2 on its 2013 list of 60 shows that were &quot;Cancelled Too Soon&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
===Ratings===
For its original run in the United States, the show aired on Thursday nights at 8 p.m. ET against top-10 hit sitcoms — &quot;Mad About You&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; on NBC, as well as the popular &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;Living Single&quot; and &quot;New York Undercover&quot; on Fox, possibly contributing to the series&#x27; low ratings.

The producers said that they could not fault ABC for the creative freedom and support they gave them during production, as there were probably few networks that would have even put &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; on the air in the first place.

&quot;My So-Called Life&quot; was produced before the explosion of youth and teen programming. The culture of television changed significantly in the years that immediately followed, most notably with the rise of The WB and UPN—networks that catered to the teenaged audience &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; sought—during the late 1990s and early 2000s (The WB and UPN launched just two weeks and one week, respectively, before &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;″s run on ABC ended). &quot;Networks didn’t understand that you could sell to adolescent girls,&quot; said Herskovitz. Although &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; drew adult fans in addition to teenage viewers, the ratings-focused ABC concluded not enough viewers of a particular demographic were watching the show during its initial network run. Holzman said, &quot;It is one thing to have huge ratings, but it is quite another to have smaller ratings but with an extremely passionate following. I don&#x27;t understand why the network did not understand that.&quot;

When the network was considering canceling the show, producers Zwick and Herskovitz appealed to then-ABC President Bob Iger, telling him, &quot;You should keep this show on the air because teenage girls have no voice in our culture, and the show is giving them a voice.&quot; In January 1995, it was reported the show averaged 10 million viewers per week, a number ABC president of entertainment Ted Harbert said was high, but still fell short compared to ABC sitcom &quot;Home Improvement,&quot; which averaged 30 million viewers weekly.

===Cancelation===
An online fan campaign attempted to save &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, the first such event in the history of the World Wide Web. Bolstered by fans&#x27; support, Ted Harbert said he was prepared to bring the show back for a second season. However, Herskovitz said at that time Danes and her parents approached the show&#x27;s creators and told producers that she did not want to be involved with the show if it continued, citing the arduous shooting schedule which required the show&#x27;s young actors to balance schoolwork with rehearsal and time on the set.

When Holzman learned Danes was no longer keen to continue with the show, her attitude changed as well. Holzman said, &quot;When I realized that Claire truly did not want to do it any more, it was hard for me to want to do it. The joy in writing the show was that everyone was behind it and wanted to do it. And I love her. So part of the joy and excitement and happiness would have gone out of me if she had not been on board 100 percent. I wasn&#x27;t able to say this at the time, but in retrospect it was a blessing for it to end at a time when we all enjoyed doing it. That&#x27;s not to say that if the network had ordered more shows that I wouldn&#x27;t have given it my best. But there was a rightness in how short the season was. This was a show about adolescence and sort of ended in its own adolescence. There was an aura about how short the series was like all things that die young. The show ended at a point that it was still all potential.&quot;

The show was officially canceled on May 15, 1995, for its &quot;far too narrow&quot; appeal. Although the fan campaign was not successful in getting a second season, the surrounding publicity led to MTV airing repeats of the show a month prior, which helped the show gain newer exposure. In a 2004 interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Danes insisted that she did not have enough power to cause the cancelation by herself. It is generally accepted that the show&#x27;s cancelation was the result of a variety of factors, including low ratings and scant publicity from the network. Bess Armstrong said, &quot;Actually, I don&#x27;t think there were any bad guys. It was just a confluence of events. It was a perfect storm.&quot; Winnie Holzman theorized that the network was so on-the-fence about renewing the show in the first place that in some ways they used Danes&#x27; reluctance to return as a convenient excuse to not renew the series.

=== Planned storylines ===
Had the show continued, Winnie Holzman said a second season would potentially have seen Patty and Graham getting a divorce, Angela turning to Brian for comfort, Sharon dealing with a teen pregnancy, and Brian and Delia getting together at some point.

== Cultural impact ==
&quot;My So-Called Life&quot; is seen as a groundbreaking television show for its realistic portrayal of adolescence and for launching a revolution of teen angst-oriented dramas on primetime TV. It is credited with moving teen dramas away from the soap opera tone of previous shows like &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and towards a smarter look at everyday teenage life.

On a 2012 list of cult TV shows, critic Melissa Maerz wrote &quot;it was the first teen drama that didn&#x27;t feel like an after-school special. No one ever learned a very important lesson or uttered the phrase &#x27;I love you, Dad.&#x27; Angela acted like a real 15-year-old, with all the crying jags and Buffalo Tom concerts that implies. What&#x27;s even more impressive is that anyone who watched the show back in the &#x27;90s, when angst and Manic Panic felt totally of the moment, can now enjoy it on a very different level. Suddenly, Angela&#x27;s parents are relatable. Dammit, we&#x27;re old.&quot;

Of the character types explored in the show, Jeff Jensen of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;[Winnie] Holzman took these stock types and made them complicated and real — you didn&#x27;t need to be a girl to feel Angela&#x27;s longing for Jordan, didn&#x27;t need to be gay to connect with Rickie&#x27;s coming-out journey.&quot; The character of Rickie Vasquez became the first openly queer character on primetime TV, and the first queer character of color. The final episode of the series, &quot;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities&quot; is notable for featuring a moment in which Ricky says out loud that he&#x27;s gay — &quot;a first for both the character and network television.&quot; While doing publicity for the show at the time, Cruz made a point of communicating that he was gay in real life.

In a 2017 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Soraya Roberts wrote &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; &quot;not only flirted with gender fluidity before it became a part of the national conversation, it questioned the parameters of conventional maleness,&quot; and &quot;was the rare primetime show that candidly discussed teen sex (according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, by 1996 only 12% of shows involved adolescent sexual content) – not only that, teen girl sex.&quot; The episode &quot;Guns and Gossip&quot; is notable for addressing the topic of gun violence in schools, five years before Columbine.

Numerous showrunners and creators of teen-centered dramas or sitcoms, including Nahnatchka Khan (&quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot;), Brian Yorkey (&quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;), Stephanie Savage (&quot;Gossip Girl&quot;), and Terri Minski (&quot;Andi Mack&quot;), have cited &quot;MSCL&quot; and its impact on them as teens. Showrunner and Arrowverse creator Greg Berlanti called the series &quot;the most painfully honest portrayal of adolescence ever on television.&quot;

The series is ranked at number 68 on the Writers Guild of America 2013 list of the 101 Best-Written TV Series, and is frequently included in lists of TV shows that were cancelled too soon.

&quot;My So-Called Life&quot; also inspired a German version of the sitcom called &quot;Mein Leben &amp; Ich,&quot; which ran for 6 seasons and a total of 74 episodes, 25 minutes each.

<doc id="657837" wikidata="Q6974779" url="?curid=657837" title="National Parliamentary Debate Association">
<text>The National Parliamentary Debate Association (NPDA) is one of the two national intercollegiate parliamentary debate organizations in the United States. The other is the American Parliamentary Debate Association. Its membership is national with participating schools throughout the country. In 2015, NPDA was the largest debating organization in the United States with around 200-250 participating schools in any given year.

==Rules==
In tournaments sponsored or sanctioned by the NPDA, teams of two debate head-to-head. Tournaments issue a new topic each round, generally on issues such as politics, philosophy and current affairs. After the announcement of the topic, the two teams have 15 minutes to prepare plus the time it takes to walk to the furthest away round in which debates will be taking place (usually rounded to 20 minutes), during which to write out their respective cases.

The standard time limits for an NPDA debate are:
* Preparation period: 20 minutes
* First proposition speaker: 7 minutes
* First opposition speaker: 8 minutes
* Second proposition speaker: 8 minutes
* Second opposition speaker: 8 minutes
* Opposition rebuttal: 4 minutes
* Proposition rebuttal: 5 minutes

There are tournaments, however, at which these are modified, generally to a 7-7-7-7-5-5 format. The Claremont Colleges tournament, for instance, uses this 7-5 format. During constructive speeches, debaters may introduce new arguments and the speaker&#x27;s opponents may rise to ask questions of the speaker. Constructive speakers can accept or reject any given question. Rebuttals are exclusively for summarizing the arguments that were made during constructives.

Over the past few years, many coaches and competitors have referred to the official title of speeches with different names. These are unofficial yet very popular with many judges: 
* Prime Minister Constructive
* Leader of Opposition Constructive
* Member of Government Constructive
* Member of Opposition Constructive
* Leader of Opposition Rebuttal
* Prime Minister Rebuttal

Debaters may not bring in printed, published evidence and consult it during the round. It is expected that debaters will use their own pre-existing knowledge and research conducted prior to the start of the actual round to back their arguments with reasoning and empirical data. This places parliamentary debate in stark contrast to the other common intercollegiate debate format, policy debate, where debaters may utilize quoted evidence.

==Championship Tournament==
The NPDA runs one debate tournament each year: the NPDA Championship Tournament, held in late March or early April at rotating host sites. While the inaugural tournament in 1994 only hosted around 40 teams, the 2004 Championship Tournament had over 300 in the field from over a half-dozen nations. The tournament&#x27;s practices are generally modeled by smaller invitational tournaments, which provide the bulk of year-long competition. NPDA sanctions many of these tournaments, and the school that does the best at sanctioned invitationals over the course of the year is awarded a year-long sweepstakes championship.

==Relationship to other tournaments and organizations==
There are usually several NPDA-sanctioned invitational tournaments in the US to choose from on almost every weekend of the academic year. The largest of these tournaments include the Mile High Swing held in January co-hosted in recent years by Texas Tech University and the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah, the season-opening Bowman Debates at William Jewell College in September, the Steve Hunt Classic held at Lewis &amp; Clark College in October and the Paul Winters Invitational at the University of the Pacific in November.

==Communicating between tournaments==
Almost from its inception, the NPDA community has taken advantage of the Internet to continue debates (and to debate about debates) between tournaments and in the off season. For years, this took place via the official electronic mailing list, much to the chagrin of those who saw that resource as best used for official communication such as posting tournament invitations and results.

Today, much of the online debate (especially between competitors) in the NPDA community takes place via the online forum Net-Benefits.net, founded by University of Southern California then-undergraduate Jed Link. The name &quot;Net-Benefits&quot; is a pun, referring to the debate paradigm by which the debate judge weighs the net benefits of two competing policies. The site is now an electronic hub for discourse and information on parliamentary debate.

==National champions==
Every year since 1994, the organization has held a national championship tournament. Winning teams include:

<doc id="657838" wikidata="Q4834873" url="?curid=657838" title="BBC Nine O'Clock News">
<text>The BBC Nine O&#x27;Clock News is a news programme that was BBC News&#x27; flagship for more than thirty years. It was launched on 14 September 1970 and ran until 13 October 2000, when it was replaced by &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;.

==History==
The &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; was the BBC&#x27;s flagship TV news bulletin throughout its run, but the format changed significantly over its 30 years. It replaced &quot;The Main News&quot;, which went out at 8:45pm, in a response to the launch by ITN of the &quot;News at Ten&quot;. It was the first bulletin to have a closing set of music; other bulletins would show weather forecasts at the end instead. The first week of the TV bulletin was presented by Robert Dougall, followed by Richard Baker and Kenneth Kendall, each presenting five consecutive nightly bulletins. The choice of these three was significant, echoing the original BBC television bulletins of 1955, which they had also presented. Between 13 November 1972 to 5 March 1976 the programme had two presenters. The set used by the bulletin was designed to differentiate from the day&#x27;s bulletins; an example of this was in September 1981, where the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock&quot; bulletin had a wooden effect whereas other bulletins used a plain blue background instead.

In 1981, traditional BBC newsreaders such as Richard Baker stopped presenting the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; regularly and were replaced by journalists; initially John Humphrys and John Simpson, who were later joined by other journalists such as Julia Somerville, Sue Lawley and Michael Buerk. However, the two most significant revamps happened on 2 September 1985 and 30 October 1988.

As well as changes to presentation, the 1985 relaunch gave the bulletin its own signature tune, distinct from that of other BBC News bulletins; computer graphics were also introduced. The bulletin became double-headed again during this period, with Julia Somerville and John Humphrys becoming the main presenters, with Andrew Harvey substituting when one was unavailable and Nicholas Witchell becoming lead presenter when neither were available. Humphreys left in 1986 to present Today on BBC Radio 4, while Somerville defected to ITN the following year. Martyn Lewis became lead presenter, substituted by Witchell and Buerk. Co-newcasters around this period included Harvey, Philip Hayton, Debbie Thrower and Moira Stuart

The revamp on 31 October 1988 was more about content as well as style. An increasing emphasis was placed on analysis and specialist journalism. At the same time the programme reverted to a single presenter, usually Buerk or Lewis on rotation. Humphreys and Harvey provided relief when neither were available. At this time, the programme was typically 28minutes long.

On 13 April 1993, all of the BBC News bulletins were relaunched with a more uniform look. This programme and the late weekend bulletins were given a darker set and a stereo orchestral version of the previous mono title music. Lewis and Peter Sissons swapped jobs in 1994, Lewis becoming a main presenter of the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; while Sissons joined Buerk on rotation for the Nine O&#x27;Clock bulletin. Humphreys and Witchell were relief newscasters.

A more comprehensive relaunch of all the BBC News output came on 10 May 1999, after which this programme shared a common theme and set with its daytime counterparts. During this period, the programme was advertised as the &quot;BBC News at Nine&quot;. George Alagiah became the relief newscaster around this period.

In August 2000, BBC Director-General Greg Dyke announced plans to move the bulletin to 10pm, initially scheduled for 2001. However, in response to the impending return of &quot;ITV News at Ten&quot;, this was moved forward to the 16 October 2000. As a result the final bulletin, before the transition to the &quot;BBC Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; (2000–present), was presented by George Alagiah in Jerusalem and Peter Sissons in London on 13 October 2000.

The programme was broadcast on BBC One and inspired a BBC Two comedy show running in the same time slot, &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;.

<text>Chomo Lonzo () is a mountain in Tibet, 5 km northeast of Makalu in the Mahalungur (Mohalingor) or Khumbu Himalayas. Alternate spellings of the same name include Chomolonzo, Chomolönzo, Chomo Lönzo, Jomolönzo, and Lhamalangcho.

Chomo-Lonzo has three distinct summits. The Southern, main peak (7804m) is joined via a ~ 7250m saddle to the Central peak (7565m), which is joined via a ~7050m saddle to a ~7200m North (or North West) peak.

While from Nepal the mountain is overpowered by nearby Makalu, the fifth-highest peak in the world, the three peaks are a very impressive and dominating sight from the Kangshung valley in Tibet. Chomo-Lonzo translates to “bird goddess” and from the East the mountain indeed brings to mind a 3 km high eagle with spread wings.

==Climbing History==
On October 30, 1954 the French climbers Jean Couzy and Lionel Terray made the first ascent of the main summit via the gently sloping SW ridge from the 7200m Sakietang La that separates Chomo Lonzo from Makalu. They did this as an afterthought during a reconnaissance expedition to the Makalu, which they first-ascended the next year. The second ascent was on October 24, 1993 by a Japanese expedition which found a route through the NW face that joined the SW ridge half-way. A third and currently last ascent of the main peak in 1994 followed the original SW ridge route. The Central and North peaks remained unclimbed until 2005.

In April 2005, a French expedition first explored the NE face but, finding it too challenging, approached the mountain from the West and Northwest instead. One team (Yannick Graziani, Christian Trommsdorff and Patrick Wagnon) climbed the North summit over the NW ridge on May 7, while another (Stéphane Benoist and Patrice Glairon-Rappaz) reached it over the West face on May 16. The first team reascended the North peak and continued to reach the central peak on May 21. The initial plan to traverse all three peaks and descend via the Sakietang La proved impossible.

<doc id="657855" wikidata="Q1124852" url="?curid=657855" title="El Capitan">
<text>El Capitan (; ) is a vertical rock formation in Yosemite National Park, on the north side of Yosemite Valley, near its western end. The granite monolith is about from base to summit along its tallest face and is a world-famous location for big wall climbing, including the disciplines of aid climbing, free climbing, and more recently for free solo climbing.

The top of El Capitan can be reached by hiking out of Yosemite Valley on the trail next to Yosemite Falls, then proceeding west. For climbers, the challenge is to climb up the sheer granite face. There are many named climbing routes, all of them arduous, including &quot;Iron Hawk&quot; and &quot;Sea of Dreams&quot;.

==Naming==

The formation was named &quot;El Capitan&quot; by the Mariposa Battalion when they explored the valley in 1851. &quot;El Capitán&quot; (&quot;the captain&quot;, &quot;the chief&quot;) was taken to be a loose Spanish translation of the local Native American name for the cliff, &quot;Tutokanula&quot;, meaning &quot;Rock Chief&quot; (the exact spelling of Tutokanula varies in different accounts as it is a phonetic transcription from the Miwok language).

The &quot;Rock Chief&quot; etymology is based on the written account of Mariposa Battalion doctor Lafayette Bunnell in his 1892 book. Bunnell reports that Ahwahneechee Chief Tenaya explained to him in 1851 that the massive formation, called Tutokanula, could be translated as &quot;Rock Chief&quot; because the face of the cliff looks like a giant chief made of rock. In Bunnell&#x27;s account, however, he notes that this translation may be wrong, stating: &quot;I am not etymologist enough to understand just how the word has been constructed… [If] I am found in error, I shall be most willing to acknowledge it, for few things appear more uncertain, or more difficult to obtain, than a complete understanding of the soul of an Indian language.&quot;

An alternative etymology is that Tutokanula is Miwok for &quot;Inchworm Rock&quot;. Julia F. Parker, the preeminent Coast Miwok-Kashaya Pomo basket-weaver and Yosemite Museum cultural ambassador since 1960, explains that the name Tutokanula, or &quot;Inchworm Rock&quot;, originates in the Miwok creation story for the giant rock, a legend in which two bear cubs are improbably rescued by a humble inchworm. In the story, a mother bear and her two cubs are walking along the river. The mother forages for seeds and berries while the two cubs nap in the sun on a flat rock. While the cubs sleep, the rock grows and grows, above the trees and into the sky. The mother bear is unable to climb the rock to get to her cubs and she becomes afraid and asks for help. The fox, the mouse, the mountain lion, and every other animal tries to climb to the top of the giant rock but they each fail. Finally, the lowly little inchworm tries the climb and successfully makes it all the way to the top and rescues the cubs. All the animals are happy to see that the little inchworm has saved the two bear cubs and the rock is named in the inchworm&#x27;s honor.

The &quot;Inchworm Rock&quot; version of the meaning of Tutokanula is also described in the story &quot;Two Bear Cubs: A Miwok Legend from California&#x27;s Yosemite Valley&quot; by Robert D. San Souci and in the First People Miwok recounting of the El Cap legend.

==Geology==

El Capitan is composed almost entirely of a pale, coarse-grained granite approximately 100 MYA (million years old). In addition to El Capitan, this granite forms most of the rock features of the western portions of Yosemite Valley. A separate intrusion of igneous rock, the Taft Granite, forms the uppermost portions of the cliff face.

A third igneous rock, diorite, is present as dark-veined intrusions through both kinds of granite, especially prominent in the area known as the North America Wall.

Along with most of the other rock formations of Yosemite Valley, El Capitan was carved by glacial action. Several periods of glaciation have occurred in the Sierra Nevada, but the Sherwin Glaciation, which lasted from approximately 1.3 MYA to 1 MYA, is considered to be responsible for the majority of the sculpting. The El Capitan Granite is relatively free of joints, and as a result the glacial ice did not erode the rock face as much as other, more jointed, rocks nearby. Nonetheless, as with most of the rock forming Yosemite&#x27;s features, El Capitan&#x27;s granite is under enormous internal tension brought on by the compression experienced prior to the erosion that brought it to the surface. These forces contribute to the creation of features such as the &quot;Texas Flake&quot;, a large block of granite slowly detaching from the main rock face about halfway up the side of the cliff.

==Climbing history==
Between the two main faces, the Southwest (on the left when looking directly at the wall) and the Southeast, is a prow. While today there are numerous established big wall climbing routes on both faces (for both free climbing and aid climbing), the most popular and most historically famous route is &quot;The Nose&quot;, which follows this prow.

===Pioneering &quot;The Nose&quot;===
&quot;The Nose&quot; was climbed in 1958 by Warren Harding, Wayne Merry and George Whitmore in 47 days using &quot;siege&quot; tactics: climbing in an expedition style using fixed ropes along the length of the route, linking established camps along the way. The fixed manila ropes allowed the climbers to ascend and descend from the ground throughout the 18-month project, although they presented unique levels of danger as well, sometimes breaking due to the long exposure to cold temperatures. The climbing team relied heavily on aid climbing, using rope, pitons and expansion bolts to make it to the summit. The second ascent of &quot;The Nose&quot; was in 1960 by Royal Robbins, Joe Fitschen, Chuck Pratt and Tom Frost, who took seven days in the first continuous climb of the route without siege tactics. The first solo climb of &quot;The Nose&quot; was done by Tom Bauman in 1969. The first ascent of &quot;The Nose&quot; in one day was accomplished in 1975 by John Long, Jim Bridwell and Billy Westbay.


===Expansion of routes===
Efforts during the 1960s and 1970s explored the other faces of El Capitan, and many of the early routes are still popular today. Among the early classics are the &quot;Salathé Wall&quot; (1961, Royal Robbins, Chuck Pratt and Tom Frost) on the southwest face, and the &quot;North America Wall&quot; (1964, Royal Robbins, Yvon Chouinard, Chuck Pratt and Tom Frost) on the southeast face. Also climbed in the 1960s are routes such as: &quot;Dihedral Wall&quot; (1962, Ed Cooper, Jim Baldwin and Glen Denny); &quot;West Buttress&quot; (1963, Layton Kor and Steve Roper); and &quot;Muir Wall&quot; (1965, Yvon Chouinard and TM Herbert).
 Later ascents include: &quot;Wall of the Early Morning Light&quot;, now known as &quot;Dawn Wall&quot;, on the Southeast face, adjacent to the prow (1970, Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell); &quot;Zodiac&quot; (1972, Charlie Porter (solo)); &quot;The Shield&quot; (1972, Porter and Gary Bocarde); &quot;Mescalito&quot; (1973, Porter, Steve Sutton, Hugh Burton and C. Nelson); &quot;Pacific Ocean Wall&quot; (1975, Jim Bridwell, Billy Westbay, Jay Fiske and Fred East); &quot;Sea of Dreams&quot; (1978, Bridwell, Dale Bard and Dave Diegelman); &quot;Jolly Roger&quot; (1979, Charles Cole and Steve Grossman); and &quot;Wings of Steel&quot; (1982, Richard Jensen and Mark Smith). Today there are over 70 routes on El Capitan of various difficulties and danger levels. New routes continue to be established, usually consisting of additions to, or links between, existing routes.

===Solo ascents===
After his successful solo ascent of the Leaning Tower, Royal Robbins turned his attention to the Yvon Chouinard-T.M. Herbert &quot;Muir Wall&quot; route, completing the first solo ascent of El Capitan in 10 days in 1968. The first solo ascents of El Capitan&#x27;s four classic &quot;siege&quot; routes were accomplished by Thomas Bauman on &quot;The Nose&quot; in 1969; Peter Hann on the &quot;Salathé Wall&quot; in 1972; Robert Kayen on the Layton Kor-Steve Roper &quot;West Buttress&quot; route in 1982; and Beverly Johnson on the Cooper-Baldwin-Denny &quot;Dihedral Wall&quot; route in 1978. Other noteworthy early solo ascents were the solo first ascent of &quot;Cosmos&quot; by Jim Dunn in 1972, &quot;Zodiac&quot; by Charlie Porter in 1972; &quot;Tangerine Trip&quot; by David Mittel in 1985; and &quot;The Pacific Ocean Wall&quot; by Rob Slater in 1982. These ascents took 7 to 14 days that required the solo climber lead each pitch, and then rappel, clean the climbing gear, reascend the lead rope, and haul equipment, food and water using a second haul rope.
Alex Honnold was the first to free solo El Cap entirely on June 3 of 2017. It took him 3 hours and 56 mins to climb via the Freerider route.

===Ascents by women===

Beverly Johnson successfully ascended El Capitan, via the Nose route, with Dan Asay in June 1973. In September 1973, Beverly Johnson and Sibylle Hechtel were the first team of women to ascend El Capitan via the Triple Direct route, which takes the first ten pitches of the Salathe Wall, then continues up the middle portion of El Capitan via the Muir Wall, and finishes on the upper pitches of the Nose route. In 1977, Molly Higgins and Barb Eastman climbed the Nose, to become the second party of women to climb El Capitan and the first to climb it via the Nose. In 1978, Bev Johnson was the first woman to solo El Capitan by climbing the Dihedral Wall. In 1993, Lynn Hill established the first free Ascent of The Nose (IV 5.14a/b). Hazel Findlay has made three free ascents of El Capitan, including the first female ascent of &quot;Golden Gate&quot; in 2011, the first female ascent of &quot;Pre-Muir Wall&quot; in 2012, and a three-day ascent of &quot;Freerider&quot; in 2013 and &#x27;Salathe&#x27; in 2017. The oldest woman to climb El Capitan is Dierdre Wolownick, mother to Alex Honnold, who was 66 at the time when she first became the oldest woman to climb El Capitan in 2017, and later broke her own record and again became the oldest woman to climb El Capitan in 2021 on her 70th birthday. On June 12, 2019, 10-year-old Selah Schneiter became the then-youngest person to scale El Capitan, via The Nose route. On November 4, 2020, American Emily Harrington became the fourth woman to free climb El Capitan in a single day and the fourth person (and first woman) to have done so via the route &quot;Golden Gate&quot;.

===Free climbing===
As it became clear that any non-crumbling face could be climbed with sufficient perseverance and bolt-hole drilling, some climbers began searching for El Capitan routes that could be climbed either free or with minimal aid. The &quot;West Face&quot; route was free climbed in 1979 by Ray Jardine and Bill Price; but despite numerous efforts by Jardine and others, &quot;The Nose&quot; resisted free attempts for another fourteen years. The first free ascent of a main El Cap route, though, was not &quot;The Nose&quot;, but &quot;Salathé Wall&quot;. Todd Skinner and Paul Piana made the first free ascent over 9 days in 1988, after 30 days of working the route (graded 5.13b on the Yosemite Decimal System). &quot;The Nose&quot; was the second major route to be free climbed. Two pitches on &quot;The Nose&quot; blocked efforts to free the route: the &quot;&quot;Great Roof&quot; graded 5.13c and &quot;Changing Corners&quot;&quot; graded 5.14a/b. In 1993, Lynn Hill came close to freeing &quot;The Nose&quot;, making it past the &quot;Great Roof&quot; and up to Camp VI without falling, stopped only on &quot;Changing Corners&quot; by a piton jammed in a critical finger hold. After removing the piton she re-climbed the route from the ground. After four days of climbing, Hill reached the summit, making her the first person to free climb &quot;The Nose&quot;. A year later, Hill returned to free climb &quot;The Nose&quot; in a day, this time reaching the summit in just 23 hours and setting a new standard for free climbing on El Capitan.

&quot;The Nose&quot; saw a second free ascent in 1998, when Scott Burke summitted after 261 days of effort. On October 14, 2005, Tommy Caldwell and Beth Rodden, then husband and wife, became the third and fourth people (and the first couple) to free climb &quot;The Nose&quot;. They took four days on the ascent, swapping leads with each climber free climbing each pitch, either leading or following. Two days later, Caldwell returned to free climb &quot;The Nose&quot; in less than 12 hours. Caldwell returned two weeks later to free climb El Capitan twice in a day, completing &quot;The Nose&quot; with Rodden, then descending and leading &quot;Freerider&quot; in a combined time of 23 hours 23 minutes.

On January 14, 2015, American climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson completed the first free climb of a route on the southeast face of El Capitan (known as &quot;The Wall of Early Morning Light&quot;), which they called &quot;The Dawn Wall&quot;; the climb took 19 days and created the world&#x27;s first-ever multi-pitch climbing route at the grade of . In November 2016, Czech climber Adam Ondra made the first repeat of &quot;The Dawn Wall&quot; in 8 days, leading every single pitch himself. The &quot;Dawn Wall&quot; was repeated for the fourth time by Belgian climber Sébastien Berthe in January 2025.

In 2016, Pete Whittaker became the first person to make an all-free rope solo ascent–which means on every pitch one free climbs to an anchor, abseils to retrieve gear, and then jumars up again to the high point–of El Capitan&#x27;s &quot;Freerider&quot; in one day. He left the ground at 3:02 pm on November 11 and finished at 11:08 am on November 12; a total of 20 hours and 6 minutes.

=== Free solo ===
Free solo climbing is a form of rock climbing where the climbers do not use any ropes, harnesses, or other protective equipment. This forces the climbers to only rely on their own individual preparation, strength, and skill.

On June 3, 2017, Alex Honnold completed the first free solo climb of El Capitan. He ascended the &quot;Freerider&quot; line in 3 hours and 56 minutes, beginning at 5:32 am and reaching the peak at 9:28 am. The climb was filmed for the 2018 documentary &quot;Free Solo.&quot;

===Speed climbing===

The speed climbing record for the Nose has changed hands several times in the past few years. The current sub-two-hour record of 1:58:07 was set on June 6, 2018, by Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell after two other record-breaking climbs in the days before.

Mayan Smith-Gobat and Libby Sauter broke the speed record for an all-women team with a time of 4:43 on October 23, 2014.

=== Adaptive climbing ===
In October 2016, the American disabled athlete and professional adventurer Enock Glidden scaled El Capitan after doing more than 800 pull-ups a day to train for the climb. He was born with spina bifida, a neural tube defect that damages the spinal cord and nerves. Glidden was carried in a rescue basket and the descent took 12 hours.

===Climber fatalities===
Over thirty fatalities have been recorded between 1905 and 2018 while climbing El Capitan, including seasoned climbers. Critics blame a recent increase of fatalities (five deaths from 2013 to 2018) in part on increased competition around timed ascents, social media fame, and &quot;competing for deals with equipment manufacturers or advertisers&quot;.

==BASE jumping==
El Capitan has a controversial history regarding BASE jumping, and the National Park Service has enacted criminal regulations which prohibit the practice. Michael Pelkey and Brian Schubert made the first BASE jump from El Capitan on July 24, 1966. Both men sustained broken bones from the jump. During the 1970s, with better equipment and training, many BASE jumpers made successful jumps from El Capitan. In 1980 the National Park Service experimented with issuing BASE-jumping permits. The first permitted BASE jump was performed on August 4, 1980, by Dean Westgaard of Laguna Beach. These legal jumps resulted in no major injuries or fatalities. After a trial lasting only ten weeks, the National Park Service ceased issuing permits and effectively shut down all BASE jumping on El Capitan. On October 22, 1999, BASE jumper and stuntwoman Jan Davis died in a jump conducted as part of a protest event involving five jumpers. The event was intended to protest the death of Frank Gambalie, who had landed safely but drowned while fleeing park rangers, and to demonstrate the assertion that BASE jumping could be performed safely.

<text>Claudio Bunster Weitzman (; born April 15, 1947) is a Chilean theoretical physicist. Until 2005 his name was Claudio Teitelboim Weitzman.

==Biography==
Until 2005 Bunster thought he was the biological son of Volodia Teitelboim, when he learned that his biological father was lawyer Bruno Bunster. He was convinced that this was a machination of the leadership of the Communist Party. He became estranged from his adoptive father, changed his name and did not attend his funeral. 

Claudio Bunster attended at Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera, a prestigious public high school of Santiago. Bunster was educated at the University of Chile and Princeton University, where he earned his doctorate in physics in 1973. Bunster has conducted frontier research and taught at Princeton University and at the University of Texas at Austin. He has also been &quot;Long Term Member&quot; of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.

Bunster has been Director of the Center for Scientific Studies (CECS) from its inception in 1984. Originally operating from Santiago, in 2000 this autonomous institute moved South of Chile, Valdivia, in the 40S parallel, where the search has expanded and deepened in the areas of life, our planet and the cosmos.

In addition to his research in theoretical physics and his work as Director of CECs, Bunster has engaged in public service. He was Scientific Adviser to the President during the administration of President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle (1994–2000). During his tenure as presidential adviser the Presidential Chairs in Science and the Millennium Science Initiative were established. He was also a member of the Panel on Human Rights, established by the government, and involving both the civilian and the military, to address outstanding human rights issues.

Bunster has been especially involved in incorporating the armed forces in scientific endeavors, as a way of strengthening democracy through science. This interest has led to joint work in science among CECs, the Army, Navy and Air Force of Chile and distinguished foreign institutions. Among the fruits of these collaborations are several unprecedented expeditions to Antarctica in which Bunster was directly involved.

He received Chile&#x27;s National Prize for Exact Sciences in 1995 and was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the United States in 2005 and was made Honorary Member of the Solvay Institutes in Brussels in 2007. The World Academy of Sciences for the advancement of science in developing countries, awarded Bunster in 2013, with the TWAS-Lenovo Prize.

<doc id="657858" wikidata="Q531136" url="?curid=657858" title="Affordance">
<text>In psychology, affordance is what the environment offers the individual. In design, affordance has a narrower meaning; it refers to possible actions that an actor can readily perceive. 

American psychologist James J. Gibson coined the term in his 1966 book, &quot;The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems&quot;, and it occurs in many of his earlier essays. His best-known definition is from his 1979 book, &quot;The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception&quot;:

The word is used in a variety of fields: perceptual psychology; cognitive psychology; environmental psychology; evolutionary psychology; criminology; industrial design; human–computer interaction (HCI); interaction design; user-centered design; communication studies; instructional design; science, technology, and society (STS); sports science; and artificial intelligence.

== Original development ==
Gibson developed the concept of affordance over many years, culminating in his final book, &quot;The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception&quot; in 1979. He defined an affordance as what the environment provides or furnishes the animal. Notably, Gibson compares an affordance with an ecological niche emphasizing the way niches characterize how an animal lives in its environment.

The key to understanding affordance is that it is relational and characterizes the suitability of the environment to the observer, and so, depends on their current intentions and their capabilities. For instance, a set of steps which rises high does not afford climbing to the crawling infant, yet might provide rest to a tired adult or the opportunity to move to another floor for an adult who wished to reach an alternative destination. This notion of intention/needs is critical to an understanding of affordance, as it explains how the same aspect of the environment can provide different affordances to different people, and even to the same individual at another point in time. As Gibson puts it, “Needs control the perception of affordances (selective attention) and also initiate acts.”

Affordances were further studied by Eleanor J. Gibson, wife of James J. Gibson, who created her theory of perceptual learning around this concept. Her book, &quot;An Ecological Approach to Perceptual Learning and Development&quot;, explores affordances further.

Gibson&#x27;s is the prevalent definition in cognitive psychology. According to Gibson, humans tend to alter and modify their environment so as to change its affordances to better suit them. In his view, humans change the environment to make it easier to live in (even if making it harder for other animals to live in it): to keep warm, to see at night, to rear children, and to move around. This tendency to change the environment is natural to humans, and Gibson argues that it is a mistake to treat the social world apart from the material world or the tools apart from the natural environment. He points out that manufacturing was originally done by hand as a kind of manipulation. Gibson argues that learning to perceive an affordance is an essential part of socialization.

The theory of affordances introduces a &quot;value-rich ecological object&quot;. Affordances cannot be described within the value-neutral language of physics, but rather introduces notions of benefits and injuries to someone. An affordance captures this beneficial/injurious aspect of objects and relates them to the animal for whom they are well/ill-suited. During childhood development, a child learns to perceive not only the affordances for the self, but also how those same objects furnish similar affordances to another. A child can be introduced to the conventional meaning of an object by manipulating which objects command attention and demonstrating how to use the object through performing its central function. By learning how to use an artifact, a child “enters into the shared practices of society” as when they learn to use a toilet or brush their teeth. And so, by learning the affordances, or conventional meaning of an artifact, children learn the artifact&#x27;s social world and further, become a member of that world.

Anderson, Yamagishi and Karavia (2002) found that merely looking at an object primes the human brain to perform the action the object affords.

== As perceived action possibilities ==
In 1988, Donald Norman appropriated the term &quot;affordances&quot; in the context of Human–Computer Interaction to refer to just those action possibilities that are readily perceivable by an actor. This new definition of &quot;action possibilities&quot; has now become synonymous with Gibson&#x27;s work, although Gibson himself never made any reference to action possibilities in any of his writing. Through Norman&#x27;s book &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot;, this interpretation was popularized within the fields of HCI, interaction design, and user-centered design. It makes the concept dependent not only on the physical capabilities of an actor, but also on their goals, beliefs, and past experiences. If an actor steps into a room containing an armchair and a softball, Gibson&#x27;s original definition of affordances allows that the actor may throw the chair and sit on the ball, because this is objectively possible. Norman&#x27;s definition of (perceived) affordances captures the likelihood that the actor will sit on the armchair and throw the softball. Effectively, Norman&#x27;s affordances &quot;suggest&quot; how an object may be interacted with. For example, the size, shape, and weight of a softball make it perfect for throwing by humans, and it matches their past experience with similar objects, as does the shape and perceptible function of an armchair for sitting. The focus on perceived affordances is much more pertinent to practical design problems , which may explain its widespread adoption.

Norman later explained that this restriction of the term&#x27;s meaning had been unintended, and in his 2013 update of &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot;, he added the concept &quot;signifiers&quot;. In the digital age, designers were learning how to indicate what actions were possible on a smartphone&#x27;s touchscreen, which didn&#x27;t have the physical properties that Norman intended to describe when he used the word &quot;affordances&quot;.

However, the definition from his original book has been widely adopted in HCI and interaction design, and both meanings are now commonly used in these fields.

Following Norman&#x27;s adaptation of the concept, &quot;affordance&quot; has seen a further shift in meaning where it is used as an uncountable noun, referring to the easy discoverability of an object or system&#x27;s action possibilities, as in &quot;this button has good affordance&quot;. This in turn has given rise to use of the verb &quot;afford&quot; – from which Gibson&#x27;s original term was derived – that is not consistent with its dictionary definition (to provide or make available): designers and those in the field of HCI often use &quot;afford&quot; as meaning &quot;to suggest&quot; or &quot;to invite&quot;.

The different interpretations of affordances, although closely related, can be a source of confusion in writing and conversation if the intended meaning is not made explicit and if the word is not used consistently. Even authoritative textbooks can be inconsistent in their use of the term.

When affordances are used to describe information and communications technology (ICT) an analogy is created with everyday objects with their attendant features and functions. Yet, ICT&#x27;s features and functions derive from the product classifications of its developers and designers. This approach emphasizes an artifact’s convention to be wholly located in how it was designed to be used. In contrast, affordance theory draws attention to the fit of the technology to the activity of the user and so lends itself to studying how ICTs may be appropriated by users or even misused. One meta-analysis reviewed the evidence from a number of surveys about the extent to which the Internet is transforming or enhancing community. The studies showed that the internet is used for connectivity locally as well as globally, although the nature of its use varies in different countries. It found that internet use is adding on to other forms of communication, rather than replacing them.

== Mechanisms and conditions framework of affordances ==
Jenny L. Davis introduced the mechanisms and conditions framework of affordances in a 2016 article and 2020 book. The mechanisms and conditions framework shifts the orienting question from &quot;what&quot; technologies afford to &quot;how&quot; technologies afford, &quot;for whom and under what circumstances?&quot; This framework deals with the problem of binary application and presumed universal subjects in affordance analyses. The mechanisms of affordance indicate that technologies can variously &quot;request, demand, encourage, discourage, refuse,&quot; and &quot;allow&quot; social action, conditioned on users&#x27; &quot;perception, dexterity,&quot; and &quot;cultural and institutional legitimacy&quot; in relation to the technological object.

This framework adds specificity to affordances, focuses attention on relationality, and centralizes the role of values, politics, and power in affordance theory. The mechanisms and conditions framework is a tool of both socio-technical analysis and socially aware design.

== Three categories ==
William Gaver divided affordances into three categories: perceptible, hidden, and false.

* A false affordance is an apparent affordance that does not have any real function, meaning that the actor perceives possibilities for action that are nonexistent. A good example of a false affordance is a placebo button.
* Affordance is said to be hidden when there are possibilities for action, but these are not perceived by the actor. For example, it is not apparent from looking at a shoe that it could be used to open a wine bottle, but such a feat is possible by placing the bottle into the shoe and tapping it repeatedly against a wall until the cork starts to be pushed out.
* Affordance is said to be perceptible when there is information available such that the actor perceives and can then act upon the existing affordance.

This means that, when affordances are perceptible, they offer a direct link between perception and action, and, when affordances are hidden or false, they can lead to mistakes and misunderstandings.

== Affordance in robotics ==

Problems in robotics indicate that affordance is not only a theoretical concept from psychology. In object grasping and manipulation, robots need to learn the affordance of objects in the environment, i.e., to learn from visual perception and experience (a) whether objects can be manipulated, (b) to learn how to grasp an object, and (c) to learn how to manipulate objects to reach a particular goal. As an example, the hammer can be grasped, in principle, with many hand poses and approach strategies, but there is a limited set of effective contact points and their associated optimal grip for performing the goal.

== Fire safety==
In the context of fire safety, affordances are the perceived and actual properties of objects and spaces that suggest how they can be used during an emergency. For instance, well-designed signage, clear pathways, and accessible exits afford quick evacuation. By understanding and applying affordance principles, designers can create environments that intuitively guide occupants towards safety, reduce evacuation time, and minimize the risk of injury during a fire. Incorporating affordance-based design in building layouts, emergency equipment placement, and evacuation procedures ensures that users can effectively interact with their surroundings under stressful conditions, ultimately improving overall fire safety. This theory has been applied to select best design for several evacuation systems using data from physical experiments and virtual reality experiments.

== Affordances in language education ==
Based on Gibson’s conceptualization of affordances as both the good and bad that the environment offers animals, affordances in language learning are both the opportunities and challenges that learners perceive of their environment when learning a language. Affordances, which are both learning opportunities or inhibitions, arise from the semiotic budget of the learning environment, which allows language to evolve. Positive affordances, or learning opportunities, are only effective in developing learner&#x27;s language when they perceive and actively interact with their surroundings. Negative affordances, on the other hand, are crucial in exposing the learners’ weaknesses for teachers, and the learners themselves, to address their moment-to-moment needs in their learning process.

<text>Sulęcin (; ) is a town in western Poland with 10,117 inhabitants (2019), the capital of Sulecin County, since 1999 in Lubusz Voivodeship.

==Geography==
Sulęcin is located in the center of Lubusz Voivodeship (Lubuskie province), by the river Postomia, tributary of the Warta River, in the historical Lubusz Land. The surrounding landscape is formed by many hillocks on the plateau of Lubusz. The highest of them is the Bukowiec (227 m). The closest big city is Gorzów Wielkopolski (45 km). Over 50% of the area of the Sulecin Commune is occupied by forests.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

Excavations have shown that the area around Sulęcin was inhabited already in the 2nd century BC. The area formed part of Poland after the establishment of the state in the 10th century. The town developed from a Slavic settlement. The town was mentioned for the first time in documents in 1241 when bishop Henry granted nobleman Mrotsek the right to build a new settlement for Germans. Until the 12th century under dominion of the Silesian line of the Piast dynasty, the town with 10 surrounding villages was handed over by Polish Duke Henry I the Bearded to Mroczko from Pogorzela, who in 1244 gave it to the Knights Templar. In 1249 Zielenzig became a part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. In 1269 Otto, the Margrave of Brandenburg ordered to build a castle in the town. It was destroyed by the Polish army of Duke Bolesław the Pious in retaliation for a Brandenburg invasion. After disbanding of the Knights Templar Order by Pope Clement V in 1312 Sulęcin was ruled by the Knights Hospitaller. They leased the town in 1318 to the Brandenburg Margrave Woldemar. After a war broke out over control of the region in 1319, the town came under Polish control again, as part of the Duchy of Głogów. Duke Henry IV the Faithful confirmed the rights of the Knights Hospitaller to the town and the castle, by virtue of a document issued in 1322 in nearby Lubniewice. By 1326 the town fell to Brandenburg again. It stayed under the supremacy of the Knights Hospitaller until 1810.

Between 1373 and 1415 it was part of the Lands of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown. In 1419 Sulęcin suffered a severe damage, as the Hussite Wars reached the city.

===Modern era===

In 1574 the Polish nobility and clergy of Greater Poland welcomed in Zielenzig the first elected King of Poland, Henry of Valois. In 1591, the first school was established in the town. In 1689, Polish princess Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska stayed in Sulęcin.

From the 18th century the town was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, under the Germanized name &quot;Zielenzig&quot;. In 1733 Frederick William I, King of Prussia visited the town. During the Napoleonic Wars, from 1806 to 1812 the town remained under French control.

As a result of the new Prussian district division of 1818 a new district Landkreis Sternberg was established. Zielenzig was its capital of until 1852. In 1873 Sternberg was divided into Oststernberg district with Zielenzig as a capital and Weststernberg district. At that time the city&#x27;s industry was based on textile production and mills. In the middle of the 19th century the number of inhabitants reached 4500. After the discovery of lignite in the vicinity of the city a briquette factory was set up in Zielenzig. This led to the development of infrastructure and resulted in an increase of the population to 5769 inhabitants in 1885. After World War I a number of companies involved in timber processing set up in the town. The number of residents in 1939 according to the last German census was 5867.

On 2 May 1945 Sulęcin was taken by the Red Army. Although there was no resistance, the houses in the city center were plundered by the soldiers and set on fire. As a result, around 50% of Sulęcin was completely destroyed.

After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the town once again became part of Poland, and its German population was expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. It was initially renamed as &quot;Cielęcin&quot; in 1945 and finally Sulęcin in 1946, it was repopulated mostly by Poles expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union and settlers from nearby Greater Poland. From 1945 to 1975 it was the capital of its county, at first in Poznan Voivodeship (1946–1950), later Zielona Gora Voivodeship (1950–1975). It was demoted as a borough (gmina) centre in Międzyrzecz county of Gorzow Wielkopolski Voivodeship between 1975 and 1999. It has been a county center in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999.
