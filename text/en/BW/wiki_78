<text>Papilio rutulus, the western tiger swallowtail, is a swallowtail butterfly belonging to the &quot;Papilionidae&quot; family. The species was first described by Hippolyte Lucas in 1852.

Like the other tiger swallowtails, the western tiger swallowtail was formerly classified in genus &quot;Pterourus&quot;, but modern classifications all agree in placing them within &quot;Papilio&quot;.

==Distribution==
The western tiger swallowtail butterfly is an abundant species native to a large portion of North America’s northernmost and southernmost west coast. 

These butterflies are frequently observed from northwestern regions of Canada down to the southern tip of Baja California and extends eastward through states like the Dakotas, Colorado, and New Mexico. Although they primarily inhabit the west coast, it is not unusual for this species to be observed as far east as central Nebraska. These occurrences are typically rare strays outside of its usual habitat.

==Habitat==
These butterflies are frequently seen in urban parks and gardens, as well as in rural woodlands and riparian areas.

These butterflies can be found throughout Western North America, from South California to Southern British Columbia and Alberta.

==Description==

&quot;Papilio rutulus&quot; can reach a wingspan of . These large butterflies are brightly colored. The wings are yellow with black stripes and blue and orange spots near their tail, their have the &quot;tails&quot; on the hindwings that are often found in swallowtails.

Young caterpillars resemble bird droppings, and as they molt, they eventually turn bright green, with a pair of large yellow eyespots with black and blue pupils. The chrysalis is green in summer and dark brown in winter, and looks like a piece of wood.

Even as caterpillars, they need to find a way to protect themselves from threats during their early development. In their caterpillar stage, they mimic a snake with the tongue like osmeterium ( a defensive organ ) and two eyespots on the thorax to ward off potential predators.

==Biology==
Butterflies emerge from winter chrysalids between the spring months of February and May, the date depending on the temperature, so they are seen earlier in the more southerly and more coastal parts of their range. They are very active butterflies, rarely seen at rest. The adult females lay up to a hundred eggs in total. The eggs are deep green, shiny, and spherical. They are laid singly, on the undersides of leaves.

The caterpillars emerge about four days later. They can feed on the leaves of a variety of trees, and the predominant food plant varies across their range; trees commonly used include cottonwood, willow, quaking aspen, and many others.

The caterpillars molt four times, eventually reaching a length up to 5 cm before pupating. In summer, the butterfly can emerge as quickly as 15 days after the caterpillar pupates, but when the caterpillar pupates in the fall, the butterfly does not emerge until the spring.

The males often congregate, along with other species of swallowtail, at pools and along streams and rivers; they drink from the water and mud, extracting minerals, as well as moisture. Females lay eggs singly on the surface of host plant leaves. Caterpillars feed on leaves and rest on silken mats in shelters of curled leaves. Chrysalids hibernate. 

== Life Cycle ==
The life cycle of tiger swallowtail butterflies begins when a female carefully lays individual eggs on different host plants, ensuring that the larvae have enough space and resources to thrive without overcrowding. After hatching, the caterpillar goes through multiple developmental stages. In its early stages, the caterpillar resembles bird droppings for camouflage and has eye spots to defend against predators. 

Once the larval stage is complete, the caterpillar enters the pupal stage, forming a chrysalis–a hard shell used for protection while it develops into a butterfly. The pupal stage can last from a couple of weeks to several months, depending on environmental conditions. 

The caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis and emerges a butterfly. In the adult stage, within a few hours of emerging, the butterfly&#x27;s wings dry and expand, allowing it to fly. During this stage, the butterfly focuses on reproduction and finding a mate. Once the female is fertilized, the cycle begins again.

== Behavior ==
Due to their remarkable adaptations, the western tiger swallowtail butterfly can flourish in temperate and boreal woodlands, especially in northern North America. Unlike many tropical swallowtail species, western tiger swallowtails can tolerate cold winters as diapausing pupae, frequently surviving beneath snow by physiological processes that may involve cryoprotectants. Their developmental success at higher latitudes has been attributed to their ability to feed on a diverse variety of host plants, extending beyond the tropical families that the majority of swallowtails rely on.
These butterflies exhibit a seasonal flying pattern, with males emerging in the spring to mate with females, who then lay fertilized eggs on host plants. As a way to protect themselves from predators or enhance leaf quality, the larvae occasionally engage in leaf-clipping behaviors as they develop and feed on them. They typically have one to three generations each year, depending on the region, and adult butterflies tend to be smaller in colder climates, allowing for better survival in shorter growth seasons.

<text>The Breithorn (German for literally &quot;broad horn&quot;; 13,661 ft. or 4,160 m) is a mountain range of the Pennine Alps with its highest peak of the same name (but also called &quot;Breithorn (Western Summit)&quot;), located on the border between Switzerland and Italy. It lies on the main chain of the Alps, approximately halfway between the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa and east of the Theodul Pass. Most of the massif is glaciated and includes several subsidiary peaks, all located east of the main summit: the Central Breithorn, the western Breithorn Twin (or Eastern Breithorn), the Gendarm (or eastern Breithorn Twin) and the Roccia Nera. The main summit is sometimes distinguished by the name &quot;Western Breithorn&quot; (, ). The nearest settlements are Zermatt (Valais) and St-Jacques (Aosta Valley).
The Breithorn is considered the most easily climbed 4,000 m Alpine peak. This is due to the Klein Matterhorn cable car which takes climbers to over 3,820 m (12,700 ft) from Zermatt for a starting point. The standard route (SSW flank) is from the Italian side of the mountain (the south side) and continues over a glacial plateau before climbing to the summit on a 35 degree snow slope. However, inexperienced mountaineers may run into severe difficulty if caution is not taken near cornices or in bad weather. For experienced climbers wanting more of a challenge, the half traverse of the Breithorn crest is another option.

The Breithorn was first climbed in 1813 by Henry Maynard (climber), Joseph-Marie Couttet, Jean Gras, Jean-Baptiste Erin and Jean-Jacques Erin.

<text>Thomas Gordon Towers (July 5, 1919 – June 8, 1999) was a Canadian politician, member of Parliament (MP), and the 13th lieutenant governor of Alberta.

==Early life==
Thomas Gordon Towers was born on July 5, 1919, the youngest of four children to Thomas Henry Towers and Janet Morrison, on the family&#x27;s homestead in the Willowdale District (present-day Red Deer County) southeast of Red Deer, Alberta.

Gordon Towers was educated at the Willowdale School, and although he aspired to go to university, he was unable to leave the family farm due to the Great Depression.

Gordon Towers married Doris Roberta Nicholson (b. 1921) on December 27, 1940, and they had five children together and fostered one daughter.

In March 1941 Towers joined the Royal Canadian Artillery but was given an honourable discharge after three months in May 1941 due to a hip injury.

==Federal political career==
A farmer by profession, Gordon Towers was an unsuccessful Progressive Conservative candidate in Red Deer in the 1963 and 1965 federal elections, losing to the Social Credit Leader Robert N. Thompson both times.

Towers made a third run for the seat in the 1972 election after Thompson, by then a Tory, unsuccessfully sought a seat from British Columbia. This time he won, and was re-elected four subsequent times in 1974, 1979, 1980 and 1984. He did not run in the 1988 election following a heart attack in 1987. From 1984 to 1986, he was the parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general of Canada. From 1986 to 1987, he was the parliamentary secretary to the minister of state for science and technology. Towers was a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in 1978 and a delegate of the Canadian Branch, Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, to the 29th Parliamentary Seminar, which was held at Westminster.

Gordon Towers introduced several pieces of legislation to Parliament regarding representation, including the 1982 Private Members Bill C-223 which proposed Parliament continue to limit its membership to 282 until Canada reached a population of 50 million. All of Towers&#x27; private member bills died on the Order Paper.

==Lieutenant governor of Alberta==
On the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Towers was appointed lieutenant governor of Alberta by Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn on March 11, 1991. Towers served in this post from March 11, 1991, to April 17, 1996, when his successor Bud Olson was sworn in as the 14th lieutenant governor.

In 1993, Towers broke with tradition and refused the advice of Economic Development Minister Ken Kowalski and did not approve an order in council for a $1.5 million grant program. The program would have granted a substantial government loan for the restructuring of a motor hotel, and Towers exercised his right to withhold approval based on insufficient documentation. Towers insisted the lieutenant governor &quot;is not just a rubber stamp&quot;. Towers eventually approved the order in council on March 1, once a full explanation had been provided.

In another unusual move, Towers opened the Fourth Sitting of the 22nd Alberta Legislature with a &quot;90-minute state-of-affairs address&quot; rather than the traditional speech from the throne. Towers&#x27; reasoning for the change was that the session would last only a couple of weeks until the 1993 Alberta general election was called.

==Later life==
Towers created controversy when he called for the resignation of his successor as lieutenant governor, Bud Olsen, after he held the 1997 New Year&#x27;s levee in Medicine Hat, becoming the first time the province&#x27;s levee had been held outside the capital city of Edmonton. Towers went so far as to appeal to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien for Olsen&#x27;s removal from office after Olsen remarked he &quot;doesn&#x27;t give a damn&quot; what Towers thought of him breaking the tradition.

Gordon Towers died in Red Deer from complications of diabetes on June 8, 1999. He is buried in the Red Deer Cemetery.

==Honours and awards==
In 1989, Towers was named the Paul Harris Fellow by Rotary International, and the 1990 Citizen of the Year by the Red Deer Chamber of Commerce. Towers was made a Knight of Grace of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem in 1991, and honorary lieutenant-colonel of the 749 Communication Squadron, Red Deer, in 1992.

In 1992 Towers received an honorary doctor of laws from the University of Alberta.

<text>Tatyana Nikitichna Tolstaya (; born May 3, 1951) is a Russian writer, TV host, publicist, novelist, and essayist from the Tolstoy family.

==Family==
Tolstaya was born in Leningrad into a family of writers. Her paternal grandfather, Aleksei Nikolaevich Tolstoy, was a pioneering science fiction writer, and the son of Count Nikolay Alexandrovich Tolstoy (1849–1900) and Alexandra Leontievna Turgeneva (1854–1906), a relative of Decembrist Nikolay Turgenev and the writer Ivan Turgenev. Tolstaya&#x27;s paternal grandmother was the poet Natalia Krandievskaya. Mikhail Lozinsky (1886-1955), her maternal grandfather, was a literary translator renowned for his translation of Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;. Tolstaya&#x27;s sister, Natalia was a writer as well. Her son, Artemy Lebedev, is the founder-owner of Art. Lebedev Studio, a Russian web design firm.

==Life and work==
=== 1951—1983: early years ===
Tatiana Tolstaya was born in Leningrad to a physicist professor and Natalya Mikhailovna Lozinskaya. With six siblings, she grew up in the .

In 1974, Tolstaya graduated from the department of classical philology of the Leningrad State University. In the same year, she married a philologist Andrey Lebedev. The couple moved to Moscow in the early 1980s, where Tolstaya started working in the Nauka publishing house.

As recalled by Tolstaya, in November 1982 she underwent an operation on her eyes and had to spend three months in rehabilitation, unable to see in the bright light. She believes that period brought her into writing: without a constant flow of information from the world, her mind cleared and she discovered in herself a desire to write down plots and stories.

=== 1983—1989: start of literary career ===

In 1983, Tolstaya emerged as a literary critic.

Her first short story, &quot;On the Golden Porch&quot; (&quot;На золотом крыльце сидели&quot;), appeared in &quot;Avrora&quot; magazine in 1983 and marked the start of Tolstaya&#x27;s literary career, and her story collection of the same name established Tolstaya as one of the foremost writers of the perestroika and post-Soviet period. As Michiko Kakutani writes, &quot;one can find echoes...of her great-granduncle Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s work - his love of nature, his psychological insight, his attention to the details of everyday life&quot;. But &quot;her luminous, haunting stories most insistently recall the work of Chekhov, mapping characters&#x27; inner lives and unfulfilled dreams with uncommon sympathy and insight&quot;, and also display &quot;the author&#x27;s Nabokovian love of language and her affinity for strange excursions into the surreal, reminiscent of Bulgakov and Gogol.&quot; In 1987, a collection of short stories under the same title — &quot;On the Golden Porch&quot; — was translated into English and received positive reviews. When in 1988 the book was released in Russia, more than 50,000 copies were sold out in hours. She was a visiting professor teaching Russian Literature at the University of Texas at Austin in 1989.

=== 1990—1999: life in the USA and journalism ===

In 1990, Tolstaya with her family emigrated to the United States. She began teaching Russian literature and creative writing first at Princeton, then at Skidmore College, and gave lectures in multiple universities. She also emerged as a journalist and contributed to the New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, TLS, the Wilson Quarterly, and also wrote for Russia-based editions such as the Moscow News, the Capital and Russian Telegraph.

In 1988, Tatyana and her sister Natalya co-authored a book of short stories which was released under the title &quot;Sisters&quot;.

=== 2000—2012: &quot;The Slynx&quot;, &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, speechwriting ===

In the early 1990s Tolstaya worked in speechwriting for the Union of Right Forces party along with screenwriter and journalist Dunya Smirnova and literary critic .

In 1999, Tolstaya moved back to Russia. The next year she released her novel &quot;The Slynx&quot; (&quot;Кысь&quot;), a dystopian vision of post-nuclear Russian life in what was once (now forgotten) Moscow, presenting a negative Bildungsroman that in part confronts &quot;disappointments of post-Soviet Russian political and social life&quot;. It has been described as &quot;an account of a degraded world that is full of echoes of the sublime literature of Russia’s past; a grinning portrait of human inhumanity; a tribute to art in both its sovereignty and its helplessness; a vision of the past as the future in which the future is now&quot;. As confessed by the writer, it took her more than 14 years to compose the novel. By 2003, more than 200,000 copies of &quot;The Slynx&quot; were sold.

Soon after the release of &quot;The Slynx&quot;, three more books of Tolstaya were published. Two collections of short stories under the titles “Day” and “Night” were followed by the &quot;Two&quot;, co-authored with her sister Natalya.

For the twelve years between 2002 and 2014, with her friend Tolstaya co-hosted a Russian cultural television programme, &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (Школа злословия, named after Richard Sheridan&#x27;s play), on which she conducted interviews with diverse representatives of contemporary Russian culture and politics. In 2003, &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; was awarded Best Talk Show prize by the Russian National Television.

In 2010, with her niece Olga Prokhorova Tolstaya released &quot;The Same ABC of Buratino&quot; — a collection of poems that should have been inside the book that Buratino had sold away. In an interview to a Russian magazine Tolstaya confessed that she had nurtured the idea of this book since childhood, but only when her children grew up her niece ‘picked up’ the project and helped to write the book.

=== After 2013 ===

On June 12, 2015, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published The Square, a dark homage to the nothingness of Kazimir Malevich&#x27;s 1915 painting, Black Square, which concludes with a self-referential paragraph.

In 2018, a collection of short stories under the title &quot;Aetherial Worlds&quot; was released in Russia. Written in a playful and poetic language, the stories are a mixture of real and fictional recollections of her childhood, her travels and family. The book was awarded the . Soon it was translated into English and received positive acclaims.

In 2020, she was awarded the Writer of the Year prize. This award honours prolific writers for their long time contribution to Russian literature.

<doc id="653442" wikidata="Q1616651" url="?curid=653442" title="Hexachrome">
<text>Hexachrome is a discontinued six-color printing process designed by Pantone. In addition to custom CMYK inks, Hexachrome uses orange and green inks to expand the color gamut for better color reproduction. It is therefore also known as a CMYKOG process.

Hexachrome was discontinued by Pantone in 2008 when Adobe Systems stopped supporting the HexWare plugin software. While the details of Hexachrome were not secret, its use was limited by trademark and patent to those obtaining a license from Pantone. The inventor of Hexachrome is Richard Herbert, who is also the president of Pantone Inc.

==Software==
To use the Hexachrome process in a digital printing process, Pantone produced a plugin for Adobe Photoshop that allowed the designer to work in an RGB color space more typical of computer work. The plugin was called HexWare, which contained a set of Adobe plugins used by printers and designers who used the Hexachrome system. Older versions of QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign also came with the Hexachrome system already installed and enabled.

==Purpose==
The main purpose of Hexachrome was to create a printing ink system that could depict brighter and clearer pictures by being able to produce more accurate colors. Using this system instead of the CMYK ink system also allowed for printing more accurate skin tones and pastels. The Hexachrome system let users print images from computer screens that were not able to be accurately duplicated before. 
As well as producing more accurate color photo reproduction than previous systems, Hexachrome also increased efficiency as it was able to match many more Pantone spot colors. Designers would specify Pantone spot colors when designing logos, but many of the Pantone colors could not be produced using the CMYK color system, requiring additional passes on the press for each Pantone color, increasing printing costs. By using the Hexachrome system, a wider range of custom colors could be printed on the same pass as the color photo images.

==Users==
Hexachrome was used by software companies including Aldus Corporation, Adobe Systems, and Quark and printer manufacturers including HP, Epson, and Xerox.

<doc id="653443" wikidata="Q266661" url="?curid=653443" title="Lyudmila Ulitskaya">
<text>Lyudmila Evgenyevna Ulitskaya (, born February 21, 1943) is an internationally acclaimed modern Russian novelist and short-story writer who, in 2014, was awarded the prestigious Austrian State Prize for European Literature for her oeuvre. In 2006 she published &quot;Daniel Stein, Interpreter&quot; &quot;(Даниэль Штайн, переводчик&quot;), a novel dealing with the Holocaust and the need for reconciliation between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. She won the 2012 Park Kyong-ni Prize.

==Biography==
Ulitskaya was born in the town of Davlekanovo in Bashkiria but her family moved to Moscow when she was nine months old. In Moscow, her family lived in communal apartments with many other families. After childhood, she received a degree in genetics from the Moscow State University. After university, she worked for two years at the Institute of General Genetics, before she was fired in 1970 for reading and distributing &quot;samizdat&quot; literature. After this, she didn&#x27;t work for about nine years. In this time she was married and then had two kids. Then Ulitskaya began her literary career by joining the Jewish drama theatre as a literary consultant in 1979. She became the Repertory Director of the Hebrew Theatre of Moscow. Her first published short fiction appeared in 1990. The story of her acclaimed novel &quot;Sonechka&quot; was first published in &quot;Novy Mir&quot; in 1992. In 1993, she published her first novel with Gallimard in France. Her first novel in Russian was published in 1994. Until 2022, Ulitskaya divided her time between Moscow and Israel. Since 2022, Ulitskaya resides in Berlin, Germany.

=== Personal life ===

Ulitskaya&#x27;s parents were both involved in science; her mother was a biochemist and her father was an engineer. She was engaged to an American man who died in a car accident before they were married. Throughout her life, she has learned German, French, and English, but has said herself that she doesn&#x27;t know any of them well. She has mentioned that she tends to work in Italy, at an apartment she owns, but she lived in Moscow until 2022.

Lyudmila Ulitskaya was married three times. First husband Yuri Taits. Second husband Mikhail Evgeniev (geneticist, Doctor of Biological Sciences). They have two sons Aleksey (born 1972; businessman) and Pyotr (born 1975; a jazz musician), one of whom graduated from Columbia University. For 2024 she is married to the sculptor Andrey Krasulin.

==Fiction==
===Style===
In her fiction, Ulitskaya seemingly describes and observes her characters at an equal distance from each one. Rather than going in for character development or delving into the tortured workings of her characters’ psyches otherwise perceived as the hallmark of Russian writing, Ulitskaya favors capsule descriptions, though she acknowledges that her characters are tortured. Generally speaking, she makes little use of dialogue. Masha Gessen, in her tribute article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in October 2014, finds that Ulitskaya&#x27;s writing makes for compelling, addictive reading. Gessen reports that she was driven entirely by the desire to learn what happens next.

===Themes===
Among her interlinked themes are: the need for religious and racial tolerance; the problem of the intelligentsia in Soviet culture; how women shape new gender roles in society; and everyday life as a literary subject.

==Other activity==

Ulitskaya authored two movie scripts produced in the early 1990s: &quot;The Liberty Sisters&quot; (Сестрички Либерти, 1990) and &quot;A Woman for All&quot; (Женщина для всех, 1991). She regularly publishes commentary on social issues and is actively involved in philanthropic projects increasing access to literature. In March 2014 Ulitskaya was among the key speakers at the Moscow Anti-War demonstration.

==Reception==
Ulitskaya&#x27;s first novella, &quot;Sonechka&quot; (&quot;Сонечка,&quot; 1992), and her second, &quot;Medea and Her Children (Медея и ее дети,&quot; 1996) became extremely popular, and both were shortlisted for the Russian Booker Award, in 1993 and 1997, respectively. She finally won the Russian Booker Prize in 2001 for &quot;The Kukotsky Enigma (Казус Кукоцкого,&quot; 2001), and was the first woman to receive the prize. Her novel &quot;Daniel Stein, Interpreter&quot; (&quot;Даниэль Штайн, переводчик&quot;, 2006) was nominated for the Man Booker Prize. Her works have been translated into over 25 languages, including English, and have received several international and Russian literary awards. The English translation for &quot;The Big Green Tent&quot; (&quot;Зелёный шатёр&quot;, 2010) was long-listed for the Best Translated Book Award in Fiction in 2016. She has an average reader rating of 4.07 on Goodreads.

== Political involvement ==
Because Ulitskaya addresses both religion and politics in her work, she has moved to the forefront of the Russian political debate in recent decades. In 2011 and 2012, during the height of the anti-Putin protests in Russia, she became a board member for the League of Voters. She was also considered a traitor by the administration and was the subject of negative statements in state-owned outlets, such as &quot;Isvestia.&quot; She is firmly anti-Putin; at a press conference for her book &quot;The Big Green Tent&quot; (&quot;Зелёный шатёр&quot;, 2010), she remarked that the country was becoming &quot;Stalinized,&quot; something that gave her &quot;a whiff of fear.&quot;

However, she is very against the idea of Moscow being a cultural part of Europe, unlike other anti-Putin dissidents such as Alexei Navalny.

While Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Russian billionaire jailed on fraud charges, was incarcerated, he and Ulitskaya wrote each other letters. Ulitskaya maintains that the charges against him were politically motivated and thus &quot;absurd.&quot; Their correspondence was published in a collection titled &quot;Mikhail Khodorkovsky: Articles, Dialogues, Interviews&quot; along with contributions from other writers such as Boris Strugatsky and Boris Akunin.

On the second day of the Russian war against Ukraine in 2022, Novaya Gazeta published a statement by Ulitskaya, &quot;Pain. Fear. Shame.&quot;, strongly condemning the war. She was also among the signatories of an appeal by eminent writers to all Russian speakers to spread the truth about the war inside Russia. Since March 2022, she has been living in Berlin.

<doc id="653446" wikidata="Q1699535" url="?curid=653446" title="John C. Bowen">
<text>John Campbell Bowen (October 3, 1872 – January 2, 1957) was a clergyman, insurance broker and long serving politician. He served as an alderman in the City of Edmonton and went on to serve as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1921 to 1926, sitting with the Liberal caucus in opposition. He also briefly led the provincial Liberal party in 1926.

Bowen was appointed as the sixth and longest-serving lieutenant governor of Alberta. He served that post from 1937 to 1950.

==Early life==
John Campbell Bowen was born in Metcalfe, Ontario, on October 3, 1872. He was the son of Peter Bowen and Margaret Poaps, and grew up in Ottawa.

He took his post-secondary education at Brandon Baptist College, where he earned a degree in theology, and also at McMaster University. After university he moved west to Dauphin, Manitoba, to become the pastor of the Baptist church in that town. He married Edith Oliver on October 25, 1906.

Bowen moved to Edmonton, Alberta, with his family in 1912 to become pastor of Strathcona Baptist Church. He also got into the insurance business.

Bowen joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in the First World War, serving as a military chaplain. He gained an interest in politics and ran successfully for municipal office in 1919.

==Political career==

===Municipal===
Bowen ran for a seat to Edmonton City Council for the first time in the 1919 Edmonton municipal election. He won the fifth-place seat to serve a two-year term on council as an alderman.

Bowen won election to the Alberta Legislature in 1921 and decided not to run for re-election in the municipal election that year. After he failed a re-election bid in the 1926 Alberta general election, he returned to the municipal politics by winning an aldermanic seat in the 1927 Edmonton municipal election held using single transferable vote.

Bowen ran for mayor in the 1928 Edmonton municipal election after serving only one year of his two-year term as alderman. He was defeated by incumbent mayor Ambrose Bury in a close two-way race.

===Provincial===
Bowen was elected to the Alberta Legislature as a Liberal candidate in the electoral district of Edmonton. He won the second of five seats that was contested by 26 candidates, under the block voting system. In his maiden speech to the legislature, Bowen brought attention to the need for increased government assistance for the unemployed and for adjustment to the taxation system to reduce the financial burdens facing urban centres.

In 1926 Bowen briefly held leadership of the Alberta Liberal Party and also became Leader of the Official Opposition in Alberta. Bowen ran for re-election in 1926 but was not re-elected.

Bowen attempted a political comeback five years later. He ran for the Liberal nomination for a by-election to be held in the Edmonton electoral district on January 9, 1931. Bowen defeated Joseph Clarke for the right to stand as a Liberal candidate on December 19, 1930, at a convention attended by almost 200 delegates with a vote of 98 to 54. He was defeated in the election finishing third place in the field of four candidates, losing to Conservative candidate Frederick Jamieson.

===Lieutenant governor===
On March 23, 1937, following the sudden death in office of his predecessor, Philip Primrose, Bowen was appointed as the sixth lieutenant governor of Alberta by Governor General the Lord Tweedsmuir, on the advice of Prime Minister Mackenzie King.

One of Bowen&#x27;s first acts as Lieutenant Governor on May 1, 1937, was an order in council regarding the &quot;resignation or retirement&quot; of William Chant, Minister of Agriculture, after Premier Aberhart requested Chant&#x27;s resignation to implement a &quot;more aggressive&quot; Department of Agriculture. It was the second occasion in Alberta where a cabinet minister was removed from office by a lieutenant governor, after Charles W. Cross was removed as attorney general by Robert G. Brett in 1918.

A few weeks after taking office, Bowen became involved in a constitutional crisis when he refused to give royal assent to three government bills passed by the governing Social Credit Party, which was accused of exceeding its constitutional powers. Two of the bills would have put the province&#x27;s banks under the control of the provincial government, while a third, the &quot;Accurate News and Information Act&quot;, would have forced newspapers to hand over the names and addresses of their sources to the government, and to print government rebuttals to stories the provincial cabinet objected to.

Mindful of the federal government&#x27;s disallowance of some of the Social Credit Board&#x27;s earlier legislation, Bowen initially reserved royal assent of the act and its companions until their legality could be tested at the Supreme Court of Canada as &quot;Reference Re Alberta Statutes&quot;. This was the first use of the power of reservation in Alberta, and was heavily criticized by the government and by some members of the public, who appeared at the door of Government House, threatening the governor and his family. All three bills were later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In 1938, Bowen threatened to dismiss Aberhart&#x27;s government, which would have been an extraordinary use of his reserve powers. The Social Credit government remained immensely popular with the Albertans, however, so the threat was not carried out.

In the summer of 1938 Aberhart&#x27;s government announced the elimination of Bowen&#x27;s official residence, his government car, and his secretarial staff. Biographers attribute this action to retaliation by Aberhart. For a time, Bowen defiantly remained in Government House, despite the power, heat, and telephone service being cut off by the government. Eventually, however, after being forced to sign an order-in-council closing Government House, Bowen moved to a suite at the Hotel Macdonald. The building, the furniture, and fixtures were subsequently sold, and Bowen was the last lieutenant governor to officially reside at Government House. Bowen would eventually move into a home in Edmonton&#x27;s Glenora neighbourhood.

In September 1938 Bowen insisted that an order in council regarding the establishment of credit houses and other Cabinet expenditure proposals be amended to remove the authority for unlimited expenditures, and instead have a limit of $200,000.

During World War II, Bowen spent a lot of his time promoting the sale of war bonds and otherwise contributing to the war effort. Bowen made many visits to military units posted in Alberta and the United States Army posted in Edmonton and Whitehorse during the construction of the Alaska Highway. On July 2, 1943, Bowen hosted Alaska Territory Governor Ernest H. Gruening for a joint Dominion Day and Independence Day celebration in Edmonton.

Despite the friction between him and the government his posting was renewed. Bowen served almost 13 years as lieutenant-governor, resigning in 1950 due to ill health.

==Honours==
John Bowen received an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Alberta in 1939. Bowen also received the American Medal of Freedom Silver Palm in 1947 in recognition of his service to American forces stationed in Edmonton. Bowen was invested as a Knight of Grace in the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem in 1949.

In 2002, the City of Edmonton named Bowen Wynd, a road, in his honour.

==Late life==
Bowen died on January 2, 1957, in Edmonton, and was buried in the Edmonton Cemetery.

<text>&quot;The Alphabet Cipher&quot; was a brief study published by Lewis Carroll in 1868, describing how to use the alphabet to send encrypted codes. It was one of four ciphers he invented between 1858 and 1868, and one of two polyalphabetic ciphers he devised during that period and used to write letters to his friends.

It describes what is known as a Vigenère cipher, a well-known scheme in cryptography. While Carroll calls this cipher &quot;unbreakable&quot;, Friedrich Kasiski had already published in 1863 a volume describing how to break such ciphers and Charles Babbage had secretly found ways to break polyalphabetic ciphers in the previous decade during the Crimean War.

The piece begins with a tabula recta.

===Explanation===
Each column of this table forms a dictionary of symbols representing the
alphabet: thus, in the A column, the symbol is the same as the letter
represented; in the B column, A is represented by B, B by C, and so on. 

To use the table, some word or sentence should be agreed on by two
correspondents. This may be called the &#x27;key-word&#x27;, or &#x27;key-sentence&#x27;,
and should be carried in the memory only.

In sending a message, write the key-word over it, letter for letter,
repeating it as often as may be necessary: the letters of the key-word
will indicate which column is to be used in translating each letter of
the message, the symbols for which should be written underneath: then
copy out the symbols only, and destroy the first paper. It will now be
impossible for anyone, ignorant of the key-word, to decipher the message,
even with the help of the table.

For example, let the key-word be vigilance, and the message &#x27;meet me on
Tuesday evening at seven&#x27;, the first paper will read as follows—

 v i g i l a n c e v i g i l a n c e v i g i l a n c e v i
 m e e t m e o n t u e s d a y e v e n i n g a t s e v e n
 h m k b x e b p x p m y l l y r x i i q t o l t f g z z v

The second will contain only &#x27;h m k b x e b p x p m y l l y r x i i q t o l t f g z z v&#x27;.

The receiver of the message can, by the same process, retranslate it
into English.

Look at the column V (which is the first letter of your keyword). Under the column V, scroll down to the row of the letter M (which is the first letter of your message). The two intersect at the letter &#x27;H&#x27;. That means the letter M is coded as H. Next, look at the column I and see where it intersects with the second letter of the message (it&#x27;s &#x27;E&#x27;). You find the letter M. So the second letter in your coded message will be the letter &#x27;M&#x27;. Continue till you code or decode the entire message.

If this table is lost, it can easily be written out from memory, by observing that the first symbol in each column is the same as the letter naming the column, and that they are continued downwards in alphabetical order. It would only be necessary to write out the particular columns required by the key-word, but such a paper would afford an adversary the means for discovering the key-word.

<text>Nina Viktorovna Gorlanova (, born 23 November 1947) is a modern short-story writer and novelist who has been living in a provincial Russian city Perm.

==Biography==
Gorlanova was born in 1947, grew up in a village in Perm region, and studied philology at Perm University. She now lives with her husband Vyacheslav Bukur, her co-author and life companion in Perm city, where most of her stories and novels are set. In her works she creates a somewhat fantastic world populated with curious characters and possessing its own mythology. The life in her invented Perm is squalid but merry, risky but indestructible. Her main themes are maternity, hardships of everyday chores of a typical Russian woman, life of provincial intelligentsia.

==Writings and awards==
Gorlanova&#x27;s short novel &quot;Love in Rubber Gloves&quot; won first prize at the International Competition for Women&#x27;s Prose.

<text>The 1996 British Columbia general election was the 36th provincial election in the Province of British Columbia, Canada. It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. The election was called on April 30, 1996, and held on May 28, 1996. Voter turnout was 59.1 per cent of all eligible voters. The election is notable for producing a &quot;false-winner&quot; outcome, rewarding a party that got second in the popular vote with a majority government.

New Democratic Party leader and provincial premier Mike Harcourt had resigned as the result of a fundraising scandal involving one of the members of his caucus. Glen Clark was chosen by the party to replace Harcourt. While polling prior to Harcourt&#x27;s resignation had shown the NDP to be on-track for a landslide defeat, Clark was able to turn their fortunes around and led the party to a second majority government, defeating the Liberal Party of Gordon Campbell, who had become leader of the Liberal Party after Gordon Wilson had been forced out of the position because of his relationship with another Liberal member of the legislature, Judi Tyabji.

After Wilson was defeated by Campbell in the convention to choose a new leader, he and Tyabji left the Liberal Party to establish the Progressive Democratic Alliance. Wilson was able to win re-election, but Tyabji was not, who went down to defeat with all of the other candidates fielded by the new party.

The once-dominant Social Credit Party collapsed. It elected Grace McCarthy as its leader in 1993, but she was unable to make a bid to get into the legislature until 1994, when she lost a by-election in the longtime Socred stronghold of Matsqui. Soon afterward, four of its remaining six members defected to Reform BC, leaving Social Credit without official status in the legislature. One more seat was lost in a by-election, reducing the party&#x27;s representation to one MLA, Cliff Serwa. Serwa retired before the election, however, leaving the party with no incumbents. Party leader Larry Gillanders withdrew from the race while the campaign was in progress, saying that all right-wing parties should unite to topple the ruling NDP. The Socreds won only 0.4% of the vote and were completely shut out of the legislature. While the party still nominally existed until 2023 (with a hiatus from 2013 to 2016), it never elected another MLA.
Reform BC held on to two of its four seats.

Although the Liberals won the largest share of the popular vote, most of their votes were wasted in the outer regions of the province, and it won only 8 seats in the Vancouver area. Additionally, they suffered from vote-splitting with Reform, the Progressive Democrats, and what little remained of the Socreds. These factors allowed the NDP to win 6 more seats than the opposition Liberals, eking out a majority government. This was the last election to return an NDP majority until 2020, 24 years later.

This was also the first provincial election held in BC since the voting age was lowered from 19 to 18 in 1992.

<doc id="653468" wikidata="Q366255" url="?curid=653468" title="Bertrand Piccard">
<text>Bertrand Piccard FRSGS (born 1 March 1958) is a Swiss explorer, psychiatrist and environmentalist. Along with Brian Jones, he was the first to complete a non-stop balloon flight around the globe, in a balloon named Breitling Orbiter 3. He was the initiator, chairman, and pilot, with André Borschberg, of Solar Impulse, the first successful round-the-world solar-powered flight. In 2012 Piccard was awarded a Champions of the Earth award by the UN Environment Programme. He is the founder and chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation.

==Early life and education==
Piccard was born in Lausanne, Switzerland. His grandfather Auguste Piccard was a balloonist and undersea explorer, and his father Jacques Piccard was an undersea explorer.

As a child, Piccard was taken to the launch of several space flights from Cape Canaveral. Initially afraid of heights, at age 16 he took up hang gliding. He developed early interests in flight and human behaviour in extreme situations. He received a degree from the University of Lausanne in psychiatry. 

==Career==
Piccard has since become a lecturer and supervisor at the Swiss Medical Society for Hypnosis (SMSH).

Piccard obtained licences to fly balloons, airplanes, gliders, and motorized gliders. In Europe, he was one of the pioneers of hang gliding and microlight flying during the 1970s. He became the European hang-glider aerobatics champion in 1985.

=== &quot;Breitling Orbiter&quot; ===

On 1 March 1999, Piccard and Brian Jones took off in the balloon &quot;Breitling Orbiter 3&quot;, a bright red, carbon-composite, egg-shaped craft measuring sixteen feet long and seven feet in diameter, from Château d&#x27;Oex in Switzerland on the first successful non-stop balloon circumnavigation of the globe—- the first in-atmospheric circumnavigation not requiring any fuel for forward motion. Piccard and Jones, in cooperation with a team of meteorologists on the ground, maneuvered into a series of jet streams that carried them 25,361 miles to land in Egypt after a flight lasting 19 days, 21 hours, and 47 minutes. In recognition of this accomplishment, Piccard received awards including the Harmon Trophy, the FAI Gold Air Medal and the Charles Green Salver.

=== &quot;Solar Impulse&quot; ===

During November 2003, Piccard announced a project, in cooperation with the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), for a solar-powered, long-range aircraft named &quot;Solar Impulse&quot;. Piccard began construction in 2007, and conducted brief test flights in 2009 with André Borschberg. By 2006, he had assembled a multi-disciplinary team of fifty specialists from six countries, assisted by approximately one hundred outside advisers.

The project was financed by a number of private companies and individuals in Europe. The first company to fund the project officially was Semper, after Eric Freymond was convinced of its future success by Piccard. Owing to international funding for the project, the Solar Impulse is a European craft, not a Swiss one, despite scientific and medical assistance from the EPFL and Hirslanden Clinique Cecil.

In 2010, Solar Impulse 1 (Si1) made its first nighttime flight. In 2011, it landed at Bourget Field in Paris. In 2012, it made its first intercontinental flight from Switzerland to Morocco in two legs. The first leg in the one-seater aircraft was piloted by Borschberg from Payerne, Switzerland to Madrid, Spain, and the second leg by Piccard from Madrid to Rabat, Morocco. in 2013, he and Borschberg traversed the United States from Mountain View, California to JFK Airport in New York City. There were several stops along the way, including Washington, D.C. 

In 2015, Solar Impulse set out to accomplish the first round-the-world solar flight in history. The voyage consisted of multiple flights starting on 9 March and was scheduled to conclude about five months later. In order to switch pilots, stopovers were scheduled at locations in India, Myanmar, China, The United States, and southern Europe or northern Africa. Piccard piloted the ninth segment of the round-the-world trip and landed the Solar Impulse 2 (Si2) in Moffett Field in California on 24 April 2016 after three days of flying from Kalaeloa Airport, Hawaii.

André Borschberg and Piccard completed their circumnavigation of the globe with the solar-powered aircraft &quot;Solar Impulse&quot; on 26 July 2016. On the same day, they announced the creation of the World Alliance for Clean Technologies.

For his role in delivering and piloting Solar Impulse, Bertrand was awarded the Mungo Park Medal by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 2018. This was awarded jointly with André Borschberg.

=== The UN and the World Alliance ===
Piccard was named a Goodwill Ambassador for the UN Environment Programme in December 2015, partway through his solar flight around the world. Four months after the completion of the flight, during the 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Piccard and the Solar Impulse Foundation launched the UNEP-endorsed non-profit World Alliance for Clean Technologies.

In January 2018 Piccard told the &quot;Economic Times&quot; that in his travels he had collected more than 500 ideas to protect the environment that were also profitable from a total of five continents.

In May 2018, Piccard and his Foundation announced the Efficient Solutions Label, a designation given to qualifying solutions after a four-week evaluation headed by World Alliance experts. In 2021 Piccard told &quot;Forbes&quot; that the foundation had identified and certified 1000 solutions, profit-making for both companies and consumers.

=== Hydrogen Car Record ===
In 2019, Piccard set a record for the most miles driven by a hydrogen car without refueling, driving a Hyundai NEXO hydrogen-powered SUV for a total trip of 778 kilometers (483.4 miles) in Europe, with the goal to promote hydrogen technology.

== Solar Impulse Foundation ==
Following his round-the-world solar flight with Solar Impulse, Piccard launched the Solar Impulse Foundation. Its goal is to select innovative solutions to the environmental crisis and promote them to decision-makers in order to accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy. To select these clean solutions, the Solar Impulse Foundation created the Solar Impulse Efficient Solution Label in May 2018.

This certification is attributed following a strict assessment process made by a pool of independent experts, and it recognizes both the economic profitability and environmental impact of products, processes and services. The Label is awarded to solutions which contribute to the achievement of one of the five Sustainable Development Goals related to water, energy, consumption and production, industry, cities and communities. In April 2021, Piccard and the Solar Impulse Foundation achieved its goal of selecting the first 1000 solutions.

==Other activities==
* European Investment Bank (EIB), Member of the Climate and Environment Advisory Council (since 2021)

==Family==
Piccard&#x27;s family tree includes four generations of explorers. His grandfather, Auguste Piccard, was the first to fly to the stratosphere, in 1931. His father, Jacques Piccard, was first to descend to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, in 1960. His great uncle Jean Félix Piccard and aunt Jeannette Piccard were also balloonists, and their son Donald Piccard first to fly across the English Channel in a balloon. The family&#x27;s attitude, Piccard once explained, is that being told that something is impossible is &quot;exactly why we try to do it.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Piccard is married with three children.

<text>Phi Kappa Tau (), commonly known as Phi Tau (), is a collegiate fraternity located in the United States. The fraternity was founded in 1906. As of May 2024, the fraternity has 161 chartered chapters, 83 active chapters, 7 associate chapters, and about 3,900 collegiate members. SeriousFun Children&#x27;s Network, founded by &quot;Beta chapter&quot; alumnus Paul Newman, is Phi Kappa Tau&#x27;s National Philanthropy. According to its Constitution, Phi Kappa Tau is one of the few social fraternities that accepts both graduate students and undergraduates.

==History==
Phi Kappa Tau fraternity (commonly called Phi Tau) was founded in the Union Literary Society Hall of Miami University&#x27;s Old Main Building in Oxford, Ohio on March 17, 1906. The four founders were Taylor A. Borradaile, Clinton D. Boyd, Dwight I. Douglass, and William H. Shideler.
The fraternity was founded as The Anti-Fraternity Fraternity, to give Miami&#x27;s non-fraternity men a voice in campus political affairs. The name was changed to Phrenocon on March 6, 1909. The two proposed names were the &quot;Miami Friends&quot; and the &quot;Miami Comrades&quot;, which were combined to form &quot;Frenocom&quot;. &quot;Phrenocon&quot; was an alternate spelling of &quot;Frenocom&quot;, the idea being to make the name sound more Greek.

Phrenocon became &quot;national&quot; in 1911 when an organization of independent men known as the Ohio University Union chose to form the Ohio University chapter of Phrenocon. Additional Phrenocon chapters were established at Ohio State University, Centre College, Mount Union College, and the University of Illinois. At Miami, Phrenocon began to have difficulty retaining members by the early 1910s. Often, men would join Phrenocon, but later withdraw their membership and join Greek-letter fraternities. In fact, the Miami chapters of Delta Tau Delta and Sigma Alpha Epsilon were founded by Phrenocon members. For that reason, the Miami chapter withdrew from the National Phrenocon and adopted the name Phi Kappa Tau on March 9, 1916. Since 1919, Phi Kappa Tau has published a magazine, &quot;The Laurel&quot;. Previously, the magazine was known as &quot;Sidelights&quot;. The rest of the chapters agreed to the name change on December 21 of that year and invited Miami to return to the national organization as the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; of Phi Kappa Tau. &quot;Eta chapter&quot; at Muhlenberg College was the first chapter to charter after the change to Phi Kappa Tau. As part of their risk management policy, Phi Kappa Tau prohibits chapters from engaging in hazing and underage drinking. Phi Kappa Tau is committed to ensuring the well-being and safety of its members by implementing measures that prioritize their welfare and promote a positive and supportive environment. The fraternity recognizes a National Hazing Prevention Week in late September.

Phi Kappa Tau has been a member since 1916 of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC), a consortium of national men&#x27;s social fraternities.

==Phi Kappa Tau Foundation==
The Phi Kappa Tau Foundation was created in 1945 as a separate charitable organization. The Foundation&#x27;s significant expansion began in 1983 with the announcement of a challenge gift of over $1 million from Ewing T. Boles, a member of fraternity&#x27;s &quot;Delta chapter&quot; at Centre College. The Boles gift was the largest gift to a fraternity or sorority foundation up until that time and became the lead gift in a $3.2-million capital campaign. That same year Boles was named an Honorary Founder by Phi Kappa Tau. Boles left an additional bequest of over $3 million to the Foundation upon his death. Its current assets exceed $15 million.

==Organization and leadership==
Phi Kappa Tau chapters consist of Resident Councils, comprising current collegiate members, and Graduate Councils, which include all alumni or those who have departed from their educational institutions. Each chapter council is granted a vote at the National Convention, the fraternity&#x27;s supreme governing body that convenes biennially. This convention is responsible for electing the National Council, which acts as the fraternity&#x27;s board of directors and oversees its governance in the intervals between conventions.

Executive offices of the Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity and Foundation are in Oxford, Ohio. Michael McCrum (Texas State) is national president and Douglas C. Adams (Miami University) is chair of the Phi Kappa Tau Foundation.

== Chapters ==
As of May 2024, Phi Kappa Tau reports chartering 161 chapters since its founding, with 83 active chapters and 7 Associate chapters.

==Controversies==
In 2003, Bradley University student Robert Schmalz, age 22, died from alcohol poisoning during a rush week event. The event happened shortly before the university received a national award for its efforts to reduce alcohol abuse.

In November 2006, the Phi Kappa Tau &quot;Upsilon chapter&quot; at Nebraska Wesleyan University experienced the death of Ryan Stewart, age 19, and the critical injury of three other students in an early morning house fire. The fraternity&#x27;s national officers imposed a four year suspension on the chapter after the citation of three chapter members for hazing unrelated to the house fire and the arrest of the chapter&#x27;s rush president for an incident of attempted first-degree arson occurring the same night as the house fire, but, according to the Lincoln Police Department, unrelated to the house fire itself. Eyewitnesses reported fireworks being lit off earlier that morning, with investigators later finding several fireworks prohibited by University code, and of a type illegal in the state of Nebraska, in and around the house. Investigators also found marijuana, glass pipes, and items covered in blood in the house. The student-body president of the university, a chapter member, repudiated the disciplinary action undertaken by the University and the fraternity&#x27;s National Convention by noting how the chapter, &quot;[felt] betrayed by our university and by our national council.&quot; He added that charges filed by Lincoln Police Department against three of the chapter&#x27;s members were “completely bogus.&quot; The house was renovated and members moved back in the house after a six year gap in a charter from the National Convention and a lack of University recognition. This incident caused sprinklers to be installed in every building affiliated with the University and alcohol to be prohibited from university-recognized Greek housing.

In 2007, Gary DeVercelly Jr., age 18, died from alcohol poisoning while pledging the fraternity at Rider University. The chapter was dissolved, and three students were indicted in the death with one receiving three years&#x27; probation. Atypically, two university officials were also indicted, although charges against the officials were later dropped.

In 2012, the College of William &amp; Mary suspended Phi Kappa Tau for three years due to a repeated history of hazing, culminating in an incident when something was stolen from Colonial Williamsburg during a scavenger hunt held for new recruits.

In October 2013, the Phi Kappa Tau chapter at the Georgia Institute of Technology was suspended after an email from one member to other members titled &quot;Luring your rapebait.&quot; While the email&#x27;s author subsequently released an apology, the chapter was suspended by the school&#x27;s Office of Student Integrity until 2017 after a university investigation concluded that the chapter engaged in a &quot;pattern of sexual violence that suggests a deep-rooted culture within the fraternity that is obscene, indecent and endangers women.&quot; A lawsuit was filed in 2014 against the national and local chapter by two plaintiffs who claim they were raped by a fraternity member. The suit states that the alleged rapist has been expelled from Georgia Tech.

In 2016, the Miami University suspended the fraternity for at least four years for forcing pledges to participate in abusive workouts, be held overnight against their will, and act as servants by cleaning members&#x27; rooms and writing their papers for them. Phi Kappa Tau&#x27;s Miami chapter had been previously suspended for a fireworks battle with neighboring Sigma Alpha Epsilon in 2012 which led to police discovering drugs and drug paraphernalia in the groups&#x27; houses.

<text>Nowa Huta (, literally &quot;The New Mill&quot;) is the easternmost district of Kraków, Poland. With more than 200,000 inhabitants, it is one of the most populous areas of the city. Until 1990, the neighbouring districts were considered expansions of the original Nowa Huta district, and were linked by the same tramway system. They are now separate districts of Kraków.

Nowa Huta is one of the largest planned socialist realist settlements or districts ever built (another being Magnitogorsk in Russia) and &quot;one of the most renowned examples of deliberate social engineering&quot; in the entire world. Built as a utopian ideal city, its street hierarchy, layout and certain grandeur of buildings often resemble Paris or London. The high abundance of parks and green areas in Nowa Huta make it the greenest corner of Kraków.

== History ==
The historic area of present-day Nowa Huta is one of the few places in Poland settled continuously since the neolithic age. Archaeological research has discovered a large Celtic and West Slavic settlement. In the 8th century, a mound was erected nearby by the Vistulans tribe. According to legend, the &quot;Wanda Mound&quot; is a tomb of Wanda, daughter of Krakus, a mythical founder of Kraków. In the 13th century, a Cistercian monastery in the village of Mogiła was built.

In the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth century, during the partitions of Poland and up to World War I, the outskirts of Nowa Huta constituted a border between territories controlled by Austria-Hungary and Russia. One can find historic Austro-Hungarian fortresses there, as well as one of Europe&#x27;s oldest permanent airfields (Kraków-Rakowice-Czyżyny Airport, currently housing the Polish Aviation Museum).

Following the Vistula–Oder Offensive in 1945, the Socialist government had encountered substantial resistance to their new regime from middle-class residents of Kraków. A referendum held by the authorities was soundly defeated by the people of Kraków – a major cause of embarrassment to the government. To &quot;correct the class imbalance&quot;, the authorities commenced building a satellite industrial city to attract people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to the region, such as peasants and the working-class.

Nowa Huta was created in 1949 as a separate city near Kraków, on terrain repossessed by the Socialist government from the former villages of Mogiła, Pleszów and Krzesławice. It was planned as a colossal center of heavy industry. The city was intended to become an ideal city for Socialist propaganda, and populated primarily by industrial workers. In 1951, it became a part of the city of Kraków as its new district, and in the following year, construction of tramway connections was underway.

On 22 July 1954 the Vladimir Lenin Steelworks was opened, and in less than twenty years, the factory became the largest steel mill in Poland. In the 1960s, the city expanded rapidly. The monumental architecture of the &quot;Plac Centralny&quot; (Central Square) was surrounded by colossal apartment blocks. In the 1970s, steel production reached seven million tons annually. At the same time, the largest tobacco factory in Poland was opened there, as well as a colossal cement factory.

The reasons for building such an industrial city near Kraków were primarily ideological, because coal needed to be transported from Silesia, and iron ore needed to be transported from the Soviet Union, while the products were shipped to other parts of Poland, due to local demand for steel being relatively small. Such disadvantages became visible in the 1980s, when the economic crisis halted the city&#x27;s growth. Nevertheless, the primacy of political reasons for choosing this location is not obvious. Kraków was a center of learning, with established schools of engineering and scientific research departments, providing the necessary expertise along with qualified staff. The presence of good railway links for bringing raw materials and the proximity of the river to supply water also played a role. The site was elevated high enough to avoid flooding, and the historic villages that it replaced were relatively small. All of the above factors quickly made the investment pay off.

In line with the then policy of state atheism, one significant type of building lacking from the original urban design of Nowa Huta was a Roman Catholic church. However, the public campaign to construct such a building lasted several years. As early as 1952, inhabitants of Nowa Huta began applying for consent to build a church. In 1960, violent street demonstrations with riot police erupted over a wooden cross that was erected without a permit. The locals were supported by then Bishop Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II, who began hosting outdoor Christmas Eve Midnight Masses in 1959, regardless of weather, and replaced the cross every time that it was removed. In 1967, permits to build the desired church were granted, and the &quot;Arka Pana&quot; (Lord&#x27;s Ark Church also translated as the Church of Our Lady Queen of Poland) was under construction from 1969 to 1977. The complex was consecrated by Wojtyla in May 1977. Wojtyla himself, after his ascension to the papacy in 1978, intended to visit Nowa Huta during his first papal pilgrimage in 1979, but was not permitted to do so.

During the 1980s, Nowa Huta became a city of many demonstrations and violent street protests of the Solidarity movement, fought by the police. At that time, almost 29,000 of the 38,000 workers of the Lenin Steelworks belonged to the Solidarity trade union.

== Architecture ==
=== Before 1956 (socialist realism) ===

The design movement of socialist realism in Poland, as in other member-states of the Warsaw Pact, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular accomplishments were made in the field of architecture. The main lines of this new trend were very precisely indicated in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was an extremely important weapon to the creators of a new social order. It was intended to help to form a socialist theme – the ideas sparking citizens&#x27; consciousness and outlook on life. During this great work, a crucial role fell to the architect, who wasn&#x27;t perceived as merely an engineer creating streets and edifices, but as an &quot;engineer of the human soul&quot;. The general outlook of a building was more valued than its simple aesthetics. It needed to express social ideas, to arouse a feeling of persistence and power.

Since the style of the Renaissance was generally regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was also intended to become Poland&#x27;s socialist national format. However, in the course of incorporating the principles of socialist realism, there were a number of deviations observed. One of these was to more closely reflect Soviet architecture, which resulted in the majority of works blending into one another; and finally, the general acceptance of the classicist form. From 1953, critical opinions were increasingly frequently heard, and the doctrine was finally given up in 1956. To this day, the socrealist city center is considered a monument of architecture.

=== After 1956 ===

Following the political liberalization of the Polish October in 1956, it became possible to introduce modernist style in architecture. Polish architects were allowed to visit Stockholm to learn about the newest solutions in urban design. As a result, the so-named &quot;Swedish&quot; apartment block was developed according to Le Corbusier guidelines. Among other buildings from that era, the &quot;Światowid&quot; cinema is worth noting. In the 1980s, the first postmodernist buildings were built, a notable example being the Centrum E housing estate. In the 1970s and 1980s, many apartment blocks were built using plattenbau.

Nowa Huta&#x27;s central &quot;Avenue of Roses&quot; featured a nationally known statue of Vladimir Lenin, unveiled on 28 April 1973. The bronze monument was pulled down in 1989 by the city, as a result of numerous protests by local citizens. Several thousand onlookers came to watch the dismantling.

Sacral architecture should also be noted, particularly the &quot;Arka Pana&quot; (Lord&#x27;s Ark Church), which was built to resemble Noah&#x27;s Ark. It was designed by the architects Wojciech Pietrzyk and Jan Grabacki, with the design being influenced by Le Corbusier&#x27;s Notre Dame du Haut in Ronchamp.

=== Nowa Huta today ===

Since the fall of the USSR, the city that was once a showpiece for Stalinism now boasts many tributes to ardent opponents of the ideology. Streets formerly named after Vladimir Lenin and the Cuban Revolution have been renamed to honor Pope John Paul II and the Polish World War II hero Władysław Anders. Other streets were renamed after Edward Rydz-Śmigły and Ignacy Mościcki, politicians of the pre-World War II Sanation government. In 2004, &quot;Plac Centralny&quot;, Nowa Huta&#x27;s central square, which once was home to a giant statue of Lenin – on display at the High Chaparral Museum in Hillerstorp, Sweden, was renamed &quot;Plac Centralny im. Ronalda Reagana&quot; (Ronald Reagan Central Square) in honor of the former US President. However, this decision led to many objections, and the traditional name is still widely used. In 2014, a bright green statue of a urinating Lenin was installed as part of an arts festival.

== Cultural significance ==
* Nowa Huta is the location of an award-winning film by Andrzej Wajda, titled &quot;Man of Marble&quot; (), based on the true story of the rise and fall of a Stakhanovite bricklayer who helped build the new model socialist city during the course of Stalinism in Poland. &quot;Man of Marble&quot;, made in the mid-1970s, presaged the Solidarity labour union movement in Gdańsk that was ultimately responsible for overthrowing the Stalinist regime in Poland, as the film begins in Nowa Huta and ends in Gdańsk. The term &quot;Man of Marble&quot; presented in this film also contrasts the name of Joseph Stalin himself, whose last name means &quot;Man of Steel&quot;.

* When the district was built in the 1950s, songs promoted by propaganda in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland included the widely popular hit single: &quot;O Nowej to Hucie piosenka&quot; (&quot;This Song is about Nowa Huta&quot;), still widely remembered to this day, especially by many older Poles.
* Nowa Huta has figured prominently in Polish literature since its very beginning. The earliest works focused on ideological progress and on the conflict between the &quot;bourgeois city&quot; (Kraków) and its new Socialist district of Nowa Huta (a &quot;Party bastion&quot;). Among writers on this topic were Marian Brandys (&quot;Początek opowieści&quot;, 1951) and Tadeusz Konwicki (&quot;Przy budowie&quot;, 1950). A hefty supply of short poems included Jalu Kurek&#x27;s &quot;Z nowej Huty pocztówka&quot; (1953; a city park (pl) was named after him for this particular work), and future Nobel laureate Wisława Szymborska (&quot;Na powitanie budowy socjalistycznego miasta&quot;, 1952, from the collection of Stalinist paeans of praise known as &quot;Dlatego żyjemy&quot;). Although Nowa Huta disappeared from literary narratives after the period of Socialist realism, it returned during the 1980s when it became the hotbed of struggle against Socialism, and later, during the 1990s, when it became a symbol of the new post-Socialist reality stemming from both its socialist and anti-socialist past.
* Poland&#x27;s first ever opera, written in 1794 by Wojciech Bogusławski, known as &quot;The Presumed Miracle, or the Krakovians and the Highlanders&quot; (), is set in the historic village of Mogiła, which Nowa Huta was built over. The two newest housing estates are named after the play: &quot;osiedle Krakowiaków&quot; (&quot;Krakóvians Estate&quot;) and &quot;osiedle Górali&quot; (&quot;Highlanders Estate&quot;). The opera by Bogusławski was also the first theater production played at the opening of the district&#x27;s legendary &quot;Teatr Ludowy&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Theater&quot;).
* &quot;Oedipus – a tragedy from Nowa Huta&quot; is a play based on the ancient Greek myth of Oedipus, premiered in Łaźnia Nowa Theater, under direction of Bartosz Szydłowski.

<text>Christina Ann McNichol (born September 11, 1962) is an American former actress. Beginning her career as a child actress, she rose to fame in 1976 with her portrayal of teenaged daughter Letitia &quot;Buddy&quot; Lawrence in the TV drama &quot;Family&quot; for which she won two Emmy Awards. Subsequent roles included Angel in the film &quot;Little Darlings&quot;, Polly in &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot;, and Barbara Weston in the TV sitcom &quot;Empty Nest&quot;. McNichol retired from acting in 2001.

==Early life, family and education==

McNichol was born on September 11, 1962, in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of James and Carolyn McNichol. Her father was a carpenter and her mother worked odd jobs to support the family, including as a secretary, cosmetics salesperson, and movie extra. McNichol is Scottish/Irish on her father&#x27;s side and her mother is of Lebanese descent.

==Career==
She appeared with her brother Jimmy McNichol in commercials and later, on her own, in guest appearances on such other series as &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, thanks to family friend Desi Arnaz. Her first stint as a series regular came in the role of Patricia Apple in the short-lived television series &quot;Apple&#x27;s Way&quot; (1974).

In 1976, she was cast as Letitia &quot;Buddy&quot; Lawrence in the television drama series &quot;Family&quot; (1976–80). She was nominated for the Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Dramatic Series three years in a row (1977–79), winning in 1977 and 1979. In 1980, she was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for &quot;Family&quot;.

In 1977, she appeared in the TV special &quot;The Carpenters at Christmas&quot;, performing several musical numbers with the duo. In 1978, she and Jimmy made their foray into music, recording the album &quot;Kristy and Jimmy McNichol&quot; for RCA Records (AFL1-2875). Produced by Phil Margo and Mitch Margo, it included the singles &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; (a cover of The Chiffons&#x27; 1963 hit), which peaked at number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and &quot;Page by Page&quot;. The McNichols promoted the album at New York&#x27;s Studio 54 discothèque with other celebrities. In 1978, McNichol performed with Jimmy in a second Carpenters&#x27; holiday special, titled &quot;The Carpenters: A Christmas Portrait&quot;.
McNichol was one of the bigger teen stars of that era. She appeared on talk shows such as &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; and &quot;Dinah!&quot;, and made several appearances on &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot; and other celebrity-based sports shows. In 1978, she starred in the acclaimed TV movie &quot;Summer of My German Soldier&quot;.

McNichol began her film career in 1977 in &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, but her scenes were cut. In 1978, she starred with Burt Reynolds and Sally Field in the black comedy &quot;The End&quot;.

In 1980, she played one of the leading roles in the hit coming-of-age movie &quot;Little Darlings&quot;, which also starred Tatum O&#x27;Neal, with Matt Dillon and Cynthia Nixon in supporting roles. Her performance was acclaimed by many reviewers, including those who disliked the film. Later in 1980, she appeared with Dennis Quaid and Mark Hamill in &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia&quot;, for which she received a six-figure salary—unprecedented for a teenager. In 1981, she co-starred in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot; and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.

McNichol was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her performance in the 1982 movie &quot;The Pirate Movie&quot;. The same year, she suffered an emotional breakdown while playing the lead role in the comedy-drama &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; that was being filmed in France. She later told &quot;People&quot; magazine that she could not sleep and she cried the entire time she was in France. She had nightmares when she did sleep and she cried on set. She did not return to the production after Christmas to finish the movie; filming had to be interrupted for a year while McNichol recovered. She later said that the breakdown had been caused by the pressures of her childhood career, as well as the pressure to hide her sexuality from the public..

In 1986, McNichol appeared in &quot;Women of Valor&quot;, a TV movie about American nurses in a World War II Japanese POW camp. She made two theatrical films in 1988: &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; and &quot;Two Moon Junction&quot;.

In the same year, she began the role of Barbara Weston on &quot;Empty Nest&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;. She left the show in 1992 after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder but returned for its final episode in 1995. It was her last on-screen performance. However, she later voiced characters in the animated TV series &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; (1997) and &quot;Invasion America&quot; (1998).

==Later life==

In June 2001, McNichol announced that she had retired from acting. Her publicist released this statement:
McNichol&#x27;s former lover and lifelong friend Elizabeth Brooks died of cancer on September 7, 1997, a few days before McNichol&#x27;s 35th birthday.
After her retirement, McNichol taught acting at a private school in Los Angeles and devoted much of her time to charity work. In 2012, McNichol ended years of speculation when she revealed that she is a lesbian and has lived with her partner Martie Allen since the early 1990s. She made the statement in the hopes that her openness would help young people who are bullied because of their sexual orientation. 
McNichol also made it clear in the same statement that she has no plans to return to acting.

<text>Ignimbrite is a type of volcanic rock, consisting of hardened tuff. Ignimbrites form from the deposits of pyroclastic flows, which are a hot suspension of particles and gases flowing rapidly from a volcano, driven by being denser than the surrounding atmosphere. New Zealand geologist Patrick Marshall (1869–1950) coined the term &quot;ignimbrite&quot; from the Latin &quot;igni-&quot; [fire] and &quot;imbri-&quot; [rain].

Ignimbrites are made of a very poorly sorted mixture of volcanic ash (or tuff when lithified) and pumice lapilli, commonly with scattered lithic fragments. The ash is composed of glass shards and crystal fragments. Ignimbrites may be loose and unconsolidated, or lithified (solidified) rock called lapilli tuff. Near the volcanic source, ignimbrites often contain thick accumulations of lithic blocks, and distally, many show meter-thick accumulations of rounded cobbles of pumice. Ignimbrites may be white, grey, pink, beige, brown, or black depending on their composition and density. Many pale ignimbrites are dacitic or rhyolitic. Darker-coloured ignimbrites may be densely welded volcanic glass or, less commonly, mafic in composition.

==Deposition==
Two main models have been proposed to explain the deposition of ignimbrites from a pyroclastic density current: the &quot;en masse&quot; deposition and the progressive aggradation models.

===&quot;En masse&quot; model===
The &quot;en masse&quot; model was proposed by volcanologist Stephen Sparks in 1976. Sparks attributed the poor sorting in ignimbrites to laminar flows of very high particle concentration. Pyroclastic flows were envisioned as being similar to debris flows, with a body undergoing laminar flow and then stopping &quot;en masse&quot;. The flow would travel as a plug flow, with an essentially non-deforming mass travelling on a thin shear zone, and the &quot;en masse&quot; freezing occurs when the driving stress falls below a certain level. This would produce a massive unit with an inversely graded base.

There are several problems with the &quot;en masse&quot; model. Since ignimbrite is a deposit, its characteristics cannot completely represent the flow, and the deposit may only record the depositional process. Vertical chemical zonation in ignimbrites is interpreted as recording incremental changes in the deposition, and the zonation rarely correlates with flow unit boundaries and may occur within flow units. It has been posited that the chemical changes are recording progressive aggradation at the base of the flow from an eruption whose composition changes with time. For this to be so, the base of the flow cannot be turbulent. The instantaneous deposition of an entire body of material is not possible because displacement of the fluid is not possible instantaneously. Any displacement of the fluid would mobilize the upper part of the flow, and &quot;en masse&quot; deposition would not occur. Instantaneously cessation of the flow would cause local compression and extension, which would be evident in the form of tension cracks and small scale thrusting, which is not seen in most ignimbrites.

An adaptation of the &quot;en masse&quot; theory suggests that the ignimbrite records progressive aggradation from a sustained current and that the differences observed between ignimbrites and within an ignimbrite are the result of temporal changes to the nature of the flow that deposited it.

===Rheomorphic flow model===

Rheomorphic structures are only observed in high grade ignimbrites. There are two types of rheomorphic flow; post-depositional re-mobilization, and late stage viscous flow. While there is currently debate in the field of the relative importance of either mechanism, there is agreement that both mechanisms have an effect. A vertical variation in orientation of the structures is compelling evidence against post-depositional re-mobilization being responsible for the majority of the structures, but more work needs to be carried out to discover if the majority of ignimbrites have these vertical variations in order to say which process is the most common.

A model based on observations at the Wall Mountain Tuff at Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument in Colorado suggests that the rheomorphic structures such as foliation and pyroclasts were formed during laminar viscous flow as the density current comes to a halt. A change from particulate flow to a viscous fluid could cause the rapid &quot;en masse&quot; cooling in the last few meters. It is also theorized that transformation occurs at a boundary layer at the base of the flow and that all the materials pass through this layer during deposition.

Another model proposed is that the density current became stationary before the rheomorphic structures form. Structures such as pervasive foliation are a result of load compaction, and other structures are the result of remobilization by load and deposition on inclined topography. The tuff deposited at Wagontire Mountain in Oregon and Bishop Tuff in California show evidence of late stage viscous flow. These tuffs have a similar chemistry and so must have undergone the same compaction process to have the same foliation.

The Green Tuff in Pantelleria contains rheomorphic structures which are held to be a result of post-depositional re-mobilization because at that time the Green Tuff was believed to be a fall deposit which has no lateral transport. Similarities between the structures in the Green Tuff and ignimbrites on Gran Canaria suggest post-depositional re-mobilization. This interpretation of the deposition of the Green Tuff has been disputed, suggesting that it is an ignimbrite, and structures such as imbricate fiamme, observed in the Green Tuff, were the result of late stage primary viscous flow. Similar structures observed on Gran Canaria had been interpreted as syn-depositional flow.

Sheathfolds and other rheomorphic structures may be the result of a single stage of shear. Shear possibly occurred as the density current passed over the forming deposit. Vertical variations in the orientations of sheathfolds are evidence that rheomorphism and welding can occur syn-depositionally. It has been disputed that the shear between the density current and the forming deposit is significant enough to cause all of the rheomorphic structures observed in ignimbrites, although the shear could be responsible for some of the structures such as imbricate fiamme.

== Petrology ==
Ignimbrite is primarily composed of a matrix of volcanic ash (tephra) which is composed of shards and fragments of volcanic glass, pumice fragments, and crystals. The crystal fragments are commonly blown apart by the explosive eruption. Most are phenocrysts that grew in the magma, but some may be exotic crystals such as xenocrysts, derived from other magmas, igneous rocks, or from country rock.

The ash matrix typically contains varying amounts of pea- to cobble-sized rock fragments called lithic inclusions. They are mostly bits of older solidified volcanic debris entrained from conduit walls or from the land surface. More rarely, clasts are cognate material from the magma chamber.

If sufficiently hot when deposited, the particles in an ignimbrite may weld together, and the deposit is transformed into a &#x27;welded ignimbrite&#x27;, made of &quot;eutaxitic lapilli-tuff&quot;. When this happens, the pumice lapilli commonly flatten, and these appear on rock surfaces as dark lens shapes, known as fiamme. Intensely welded ignimbrite may have glassy zones near the base and top, called lower and upper &#x27;vitrophyres&#x27;, but central parts are microcrystalline (&#x27;lithoidal&#x27;).

== Mineralogy ==
The mineralogy of an ignimbrite is controlled primarily by the chemistry of the source magma.

The typical range of phenocrysts in ignimbrites are biotite, quartz, sanidine or other alkali feldspar, occasionally hornblende, rarely pyroxene and in the case of phonolite tuffs, the feldspathoid minerals such as nepheline and leucite.

Commonly in most felsic ignimbrites the quartz polymorphs cristobalite and tridymite are usually found within the welded tuffs and breccias. In the majority of cases, it appears that these high-temperature polymorphs of quartz occurred post-eruption as part of an autogenic post-eruptive alteration in some metastable form. Thus although tridymite and cristobalite are common minerals in ignimbrites, they may not be primary magmatic minerals.

==Geochemistry==
Most ignimbrites are silicic, with generally over 65% SiO2. The chemistry of the ignimbrites, like all felsic rocks, and the resultant mineralogy of phenocryst populations within them, is related mostly to the varying contents of sodium, potassium, calcium, the lesser amounts of iron and magnesium.

Some rare ignimbrites are andesitic, and may even be formed from volatile saturated basalt, where the ignimbrite would have the geochemistry of a normal basalt.

== Alteration ==
Large hot ignimbrites can create some form of hydrothermal activity as they tend to blanket the wet soil and bury watercourses and rivers. The water from such substrates will exit the ignimbrite blanket in fumaroles, geysers and the like, a process which may take several years, for example after the Novarupta tuff eruption. In the process of boiling off this water, the ignimbrite layer may become metasomatised (altered). This tends to form chimneys and pockets of kaolin-altered rock.

===Welding===

Welding is a common form of ignimbrite alteration. There are two types of welding, primary and secondary. If the density current is sufficiently hot the particles will and weld at the surface of sedimentation to form a viscous fluid; this is primary welding. If during transport and deposition the temperature is low, then the particles will not agglutinate and weld, although welding may occur later if compaction or other factors reduce the minimum welding temperature to below the temperature of the glassy particles; this is secondary welding. This secondary welding is most common and suggests that the temperature of most pyroclastic density currents is below the softening point of the particles.

The factor that determines whether an ignimbrite has primary welding, secondary welding or no welding is debated:
*Different chemical compositions will lower the viscosity and enable primary weld.
*There is not enough variation in the composition of primary and secondary welded ignimbrites for this to be a major factor.
*Cooling during transport is negligible, so if the eruption temperature is high enough then primary welding will occur. Lateral variations in degree of welding are not a result of cooling during transport.
*Lithostatic load is responsible for the intensity of welding because the Tiribi ignimbrite is most densely welded where the thickness is greatest. The correlation is not perfect, and that other factors may have an influence.
*There are two lines of evidence for the relative unimportance of lithostatic load in determining the intensity of welding; lateral changes in the degree of welding irrespective of thickness and cases where the degree of welding correlates with the chemical zoning. Welding is determined by a combination of factors including compositional changes, volatile content, temperature, grain size population and lithic content.

== Morphology and occurrence ==
Landscapes formed by erosion in hardened ignimbrite can be remarkably similar to those formed on granitic rocks. In Sierra de Lihuel Calel, La Pampa Province, Argentina, various landforms typical of granites can be observed in ignimbrite. These landforms are inselbergs, flared slopes, domes, nubbins, tors, tafonis and gnammas. In addition, just like in granite landscapes landforms in ignimbrites may be influenced by joint systems.

== Distribution ==
Ignimbrites occur worldwide associated with many volcanic provinces having high-silica content magma and the resulting explosive eruptions.

Ignimbrite occurs very commonly around the lower Hunter Region of the Australian state of New South Wales. The ignimbrite quarried in the Hunter region at locations such as Martins Creek, Brandy Hill, Seaham (Boral) and at abandoned quarry at Raymond Terrace is a volcanic sedimentation rock of Carboniferous age (280–345 million years). It had an extremely violent origin. This material built up to considerable depth and must have taken years to cool down completely. In the process the materials that made up this mixture fused together into a very tough rock of medium density.

Ignimbrite also occurs in the Coromandel region of New Zealand, where the striking orange-brown ignimbrite cliffs form a distinctive feature of the landscape. The nearby Taupō Volcanic Zone is covered in extensive flat sheets of ignimbrite erupted from caldera volcanoes during the Pleistocene and Holocene. The exposed ignimbrite cliffs at Hinuera (Waikato) mark the edges of the ancient Waikato River course which flowed through the valley before the last major Taupō eruption 1,800 years ago (the Hatepe eruption). The west cliffs are quarried to get blocks of Hinuera Stone, the name given to welded ignimbrite used for building cladding. The stone is light grey with traces of green and is slightly porous.

Huge deposits of ignimbrite form large parts of the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico. In the western United States, massive ignimbrite deposits up to several hundred metres thick occur in the Basin and Range Province, largely in Nevada, western Utah, southern Arizona, and north-central and southern New Mexico, and the Snake River Plain. The magmatism in the Basin and Range Province included a massive flare-up of ignimbrite which began about 40 million years ago and largely ended 25 million years ago: the magmatism followed the end of the Laramide orogeny, when deformation and magmatism occurred far east of the plate boundary. Additional eruptions of ignimbrite continued in Nevada until roughly 14 million years ago. Individual eruptions were often enormous, sometimes up to thousands of cubic kilometres in volume, giving them a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 8, comparable to Yellowstone Caldera and Lake Toba eruptions.

Successions of ignimbrites make up a large part of post-erosional rocks in Tenerife and Gran Canaria islands.

==Use==
Yucca Mountain Repository, a U.S. Department of Energy terminal storage facility for spent nuclear reactor and other radioactive waste, is in a deposit of ignimbrite and tuff.

The layering of ignimbrites is used when the stone is worked, as it sometimes splits into convenient slabs, useful for flagstones and in garden edge landscaping.

In the Hunter region of New South Wales, ignimbrite serves as an excellent aggregate or &quot;blue metal&quot; for road surfacing and construction purposes.

<text>Rexdale is a neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located north-west of the central core, in the district of Etobicoke. Rexdale defines an area of several official neighbourhoods north of Highway 401 and east of Highway 427. Rexdale was originally a post World War II residential development within Etobicoke, and today is applied to a general area from Malton and Toronto Pearson International Airport in the City of Mississauga to the west, Highway 401 to the south, Steeles Avenue to the north, and the Humber River to the east. It is centred on Rexdale Boulevard and Islington Avenue.

Institutions and attractions located in Rexdale include the Canadian Standards Association, Toronto Congress Centre, Woodbine Centre, and Woodbine Racetrack.

==History==
Rexdale was named after local real estate developer Rex Heslop, who purchased farmland in the area in 1955 for a cost of $110,000, and installed water mains, streets and sewers, as well as houses that listed for sale at either $9,000 or $10,000. The homes sold well, and soon 330 families were living in the development. In 1956, Heslop opened the Rexdale Plaza (once home to Eaton&#x27;s and also Towers Department Stores and since demolished and replaced by a power centre). By then, 70 industries and 3,600 homes were located in Rexdale.

Rexdale&#x27;s first residents were mostly English and Scottish, Italian but it evolved into a multicultural neighbourhood in the following decades, led by those from the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent. The population of Rexdale, according to the 2006 Census, is 94,469 living in 30,238 households. The population grows at a rate comparable to surrounding communities.

In 2006, Christopher Hume, a journalist with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, wrote that Rexdale &quot;has become shorthand for suburban blight, social breakdown and gang violence. In 2005 alone, five young men were shot dead in the area, a grey landscape of highways and highrises, shopping malls and churches.&quot; Hume wrote that children who lived in Rexdale had nothing to do, and were &quot;wandering around the anonymous streets of this place&quot;. The vision of Rexdale&#x27;s planners, Hume wrote, was a patchwork of separate precincts for working, living, shopping and playing, connected by expressways. However, this single-use zoning, separation, industrial-scale development and reliance on cars contributed to Rexdale&#x27;s problems. Joyce Lau of the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; stated in 2015 that in Rexdale &quot;other immigrants live in poverty, surrounded by crime.&quot;

In 2006, Toronto Police conducted a gang sweep, apprehending 106 alleged members of The Jamestown Crew, &quot;a violent street gang that spreads violence, chaos and drugs in Rexdale&quot;.

<doc id="653505" wikidata="Q53991" url="?curid=653505" title="Leszek I the White">
<text>Leszek the White (; c. 1184/85 – 24 November 1227) was Prince of Sandomierz and High Duke of Poland in the years 1194–1198, 1199, 1206–1210, and 1211–1227. During the early stages of his reign, his uncle Duke Mieszko III the Old and cousin Władysław III Spindleshanks, from the Greater Polish branch of the royal Piast dynasty, contested Leszek&#x27;s right to be High Duke.

Leszek was the third or fourth, but eldest surviving son of Casimir II the Just and his wife Helen of Znojmo.

==Struggle for the succession==
When Casimir II died on 5 May 1194, Leszek was only nine or ten years old. K. Jasiński, writing in 2001, puts his birth year as 1184 or 1185, while an older historiography claimed 1186 or 1187. The regency was exercised by his mother Helen, who counted on the help of Mikołaj Gryfita, &quot;wojewoda&quot; of Kraków, and Fulko, Bishop of Kraków.

However, Leszek&#x27;s uncle Mieszko III the Old – who had been ruler of Kraków from 1173 to 1177 and was deposed after a national rebellion against him – refused to accept this, and with the help of powerful Lesser Poland families, decided to reconquer Kraków.

The war began in 1195. On the side of Leszek and his youngest brother Konrad fought the nobility of Kraków and Sandomierz, and the Rurikid Prince Roman of Vladimir-in-Volhynia. Mieszko III the Old was able to negotiate with his Silesian relatives Mieszko Tanglefoot, Duke of Racibórz, and his nephew Jarosław, Duke of Opole, who promised to send food to him during the campaign.

An extremely bloody battle took place on 13 September 1195 at Mozgawa near Jędrzejów. In the first phase of the battle, the Greater Poland armies – personally commanded by Mieszko III and his son Bolesław – faced the forces of &quot;wojewoda&quot; Mikołaj and Prince Roman. This battle was inconclusive and ended with the withdrawal of Mieszko III, distraught by the death of his son during the fight. The supporters of Leszek and Konrad decided not to pursue the retreating enemy and returned to Kraków, because the casualties were great and among the injured was Prince Roman. However this was not the end of the battle, as the troops of Sandomierz led by &quot;wojewoda&quot; Goworek arrived and attacked the Silesian army of Mieszko Tanglefoot and Jarosław of Opole, who also arrived late to the battlefield. This second phase of the battle was decisively won by the Silesians, but with the escape of Mieszko III to Greater Poland, the Silesians also decided to retreat, taking with them the captured &quot;wojewoda&quot; Goworek, who regained his freedom a few months later by payment of a ransom.

The withdrawal of Mieszko III the Old during the Battle of Mozgawą allowed Leszek (or more accurately, his regents) to maintain power for the next three years. However, in 1198, Mieszko III finally regained power over the Seniorate Province through an agreement with Helen of Znojmo. On behalf of her eldest son, the Dowager Duchess and Regent formally resigned his control of Kraków in exchange for recognition of his rights over Lesser Poland and Masovia, and receipt of Kujavia (for according to historians, Mieszko III and his son Bolesław had taken over the government of Kujavia after the death of Leszek, Duke of Masovia). This time (with a short interruption in 1199), Mieszko III remained in control over Kraków until his death on 13 March 1202.

Some time earlier (ca. 1200), Leszek and Konrad, who had reached their majority and began to rule personally, decided to divide their domains. Konrad received Masovia and Kuyavia, while Leszek retained only Sandomierz, probably with the hope of eventually reconquering the Seniorate Province and the adjacent land of Sieradz-Łęczyca.

After the death of Mieszko III, the reinstallment of Leszek was proposed. His former ally Mikołaj Gryfita, fearing his loss of political influence, demanded the dismissal of Leszek&#x27;s closest collaborator, Goworek. The &quot;wojewoda&quot; of Sandomierz was ready to step down in order to obtain Kraków for his master, but Leszek, unwilling to discard him, strongly refused this request. In view of this impasse, Mikołaj Gryfita invited the youngest and only surviving son of Mieszko III, Władysław III Spindleshanks, to be the new ruler of Kraków.

It is unknown how long Władysław III ruled over Kraków. According to some historians, his reign ended a few months after the death of his father, in autumn 1202; according to others (and this version seems more likely) it lasted until 1206 or even 1210. In any case, some time after the death of Mikołaj Gryfita (also in 1202), the Kraków nobility invited Leszek to reassume the government without any conditions.

In 1207, Leszek placed his domains under the vassalage of the pope, at that time Innocent III. This put Poland clearly in the camp of pro-Papal territories in opposition to the power of the Holy Roman Emperor. After that, Leszek cooperated closely with Archbishop Henry Kietlicz in implementing the reforms of Innocent III.

==Intervention in Kievan Rus&#x27;==
In the early years of his rule, Leszek&#x27;s policy focused mainly in Kievan Rus&#x27;. In 1199 he helped Prince Roman of Vladimir-in-Volhynia with troops to reconquer the Principality of Galicia, probably in gratitude for Roman&#x27;s assistance against Mieszko III at Mozgawa in 1195. This alliance ended unexpectedly in 1205, however, when Roman decided to support Władysław III Spindleshanks&#x27; effort to recover the Seniorate Province (which supports the theory that Władysław III was expelled in 1202). Roman then invaded the domains of Leszek and Konrad for unknown reasons (although historians believe that this was due to the intrigues of Władysław III), venturing deep into their territory. Both forces clashed in the Battle of Zawichost (14 October 1205), where Roman was defeated and killed.

Leszek and Konrad then became involved in the conflict associated with the succession of Roman&#x27;s domains, which was further complicated by the intervention of King Andrew II of Hungary, who supported the rights of Roman&#x27;s widow and children. Leszek and his brother initially led a coalition of Rurikid princes who wanted to remove Roman&#x27;s children from Vladimir-in-Volhynia and Galicia. However, after some time, and in order to avoid a war with Hungary, they decided to sign a treaty. In 1206, Leszek met with Andrew II in Volhynia, and afterwards the influence of the Hungarian rulers over Vladimir-in-Volhynia and Galicia was exclusive.

Despite the agreement with the Hungarian King, the conflict continued. Shortly after, Roman&#x27;s widow and her younger son Vasilko, displeased with the Hungarian rule, decided to escape to Poland, where they found refuge at Leszek&#x27;s court; her eldest, Daniel had already been sent to the court of Andrew II. During their exile in Poland, they received the land of Belz.

A further confirmation of an active policy in Kievan Rus&#x27; were the marriages of Leszek and Konrad with Rurikid princesses. Leszek first married a daughter (name unknown) of Ingvar Yaroslavich, Prince of Lutsk, and then Grzymisława, perhaps a daughter of Yaroslav III Vladimirovich, Prince of Novgorod. Meanwhile, Konrad married Agafia, daughter of Svyatoslav III Igorevich, Prince of Peremyshl.

In 1210 Andrew II decided to replace the reigning prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia with Roman&#x27;s eldest son Daniel. However, not wanting to lose his political influence, he decided to send his troops there. The expected Polish-Hungarian confrontation did not occur in the end, because Leszek was forced to have his army return after Mieszko Tanglefoot captured Kraków.

Once the situation in the Seniorate Province was pacified, Leszek returned to Vladimir-in-Volhynia and Galicia in 1212. As a result of his military actions, he took several border towns. However, in 1213 he failed to prevent the capture of Galicia by the Hungarian boyar Władysław. Although a year later he was defeated at the Bobrka river, the danger of the zone forced the Hungarian troops to retreat. In the same year, wanting to break the difficult relations with Hungary, Leszek, under the pressure of the Kraków aristocracy gathered around the voivode Pakosław, decided to conclude a peace treaty at Spiš. According to this treaty, the government of Galicia–Volhynia was given to Andrew II&#x27;s second son Coloman, who was to marry Leszek&#x27;s oldest daughter Salomea. This treaty also gave Leszek territorial acquisitions in Kievan Rus&#x27; (the districts of Przemyśl and Lubaczów).

Unfortunately, this alliance with Hungary did not last, because before the end of the year Leszek decided to support the restoration of Daniel Romanovich in Galicia when it was clear that the local nobility did not accept the rule of Prince Coloman. The ambiguous policy of the Duke of Kraków cost him in 1215 when the Hungarians, impatient with the lack of help in securing the rule of Coloman, broke the alliance. Once the situation in Kievan Rus&#x27; seemed to be calm, the Hungarians sent an army against Leszek, using his support of Daniel as the rationale. During this campaign, Leszek lost the lands of Przemyśl and Lubaczów.

After this defeat, Leszek wanted to make an alliance with Mstislav Mstislavich, Prince of Novgorod. This new political approach failed to bring Leszek any positive results, because it prompted an alliance between Daniel Romanovich and Mstislav against him. As a result, the Duke of Kraków lost a small area between the Narew and Bug rivers in 1218.

These successive failures forced Leszek to reconsider his previous alliance with Andrew II of Hungary. This time, the treaty between them was sealed with the formal marriage between their children Coloman and Salomea. In return for his resignation over Galicia, Leszek received Volhynia in compensation, after Prince Daniel was expelled.

The expedition under the command of Andrew II and Leszek was finally organized at the end of 1219. The combination of the Polish-Hungarian forces was a success, as Coloman and Salomea were formally proclaimed rulers of Galicia. In that year, Leszek also organized an unsuccessful expedition to Vladimir-in-Volhynia. Another expedition in 1221, this time with the help of Hungary, also ended in failure. Moreover, these invasions prompted Daniel, recently reconciled with Mstislav of Novgorod, to make a retaliatory expedition that ended with the imprisonment of Coloman and Salomea and the proclamation of Mstislav as Prince of Galicia.

However, in 1223 an unexpected alliance developed between Mstislav and Andrew II regarding the succession of Galicia. It was agreed that after Mstislav&#x27;s death Galicia would be inherited by Andrew II&#x27;s youngest son Andrew. This caused a further change in the political situation, as Leszek and Daniel allied against them. Mstislav conducted an expedition against Leszek in 1225 with the help of the Cuman khan Köten. This war, just like the previous ones, ended without a clear outcome despite temporary successes. Moreover, it resulted in another change of alliances in 1227 when Leszek joined with Hungary against Daniel. This was to be Leszek&#x27;s last intervention in the long-running conflict with Kievan Rus&#x27;.

==Conflict with Władysław III Spindleshanks==
The quiet government of Leszek over Kraków after the deposition of Władysław III Spindleshanks was interrupted in 1210 with his excommunication through a papal bull issued by Pope Innocent III. This development was used by Mieszko Tanglefoot, who quickly conquered Kraków and took the title of High Duke for himself. The bull was issued at the request of an anonymous &quot;Duke of Silesia&quot;, which could only have been Henry I the Bearded because Mieszko used the title of a Duke of Racibórz-Opole. The situation became quite confused, as nobody was sure who held the real power. The papal bull was a complete surprise for Leszek and the local church hierarchy who supported him, especially since both parties for the first time in Poland agreed upon the choice of the new Bishop of Kraków after the death of Fulka, the chronicler Wincenty Kadłubek.

Henryk Kietlicz, Archbishop of Gniezno — who had returned from exile some time before — decided to call the , at which he tried to find a solution to this delicate issue. In addition to the church hierarchy, almost all of the Piast dukes participated in the convention. Leszek, wanting to regain the support of the Church and the other rulers, bestowed a Great Privilege on the clergy, which ensured the integrity of territorial possession of the bishops. This privilege was not signed by Henry I the Bearded nor Władysław III, but they did comply with the provisions established therein. Mieszko Tanglefoot was not present in Borzykowa; with the help of the Lesser Poland family of Gryfici, he went with his army to Kraków, where the confusion among the citizens as to who was actually in charge enabled him to take the capital without a fight. This was the zenith of the success of Mieszko, as he died in May of the following year. Only then did Archbishop Kietlicz manage to make an appeal to Rome in order to obtain the reversal of the Bull. Henry I, although he was now the oldest Junior Duke, directed his attention to the German invasions, to Lubusz. Leszek returned to Kraków without any major difficulties.

Another result of the close cooperation between the Piasts and the Church was the synod of Wolbórz, where Archbishop Kietlicz obtained additional privileges for the Church. The good political relationship between Leszek and Archbishop Ketlicz ended in 1216, when the Archbishop lost the favor of Rome after the death of Pope Innocent III and was forced to end his political influence.

==Christianization of Prussia==

Another important direction of Leszek&#x27;s policy was management of Pomerania and the Christianization of Prussia. Already in 1212 Leszek and his brother Konrad had a meeting in Mąkolno with Mestwin I of Pomerelia for the purpose of arranging a Christian mission that began only four years later when a bishop was sent, but without results.

However, the idea of Christianization continued. Henry I the Bearded soon became interested in helping, and with him Władysław III Spindleshanks. In 1217 Leszek and Henry I arranged a meeting at Danków. A year later Leszek met with Henry I and Władysław III at Sądowel, where an alliance between the three was concluded. Moreover, a treaty of mutual inheritance between Leszek and Władysław III was signed, wherein Leszek, as the younger prince, had a better chance to inherit. This treaty also virtually disinherited Władysław Odonic, Władysław III&#x27;s nephew and closest male relative. The alliance agreement with Henry I and Władysław III enabled Leszek to adopt the title of &quot;dux Poloniae&quot; or &quot;dux totius Poloniae&quot; since 1218.

In their common desire to begin the Christianization of Prussia, Leszek, Henry I, and Władysław III were soon joined in their efforts by Leszek&#x27;s brother Konrad I of Masovia and Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerelia. It was soon realized, however, that Swietopelk&#x27;s participation in this project was only a cover, as his main goal was to restore the political independence of his domains.

When Pope Innocent III requested of Leszek Polish participation in a Crusade, Leszek answered in a long letter that &quot;neither he nor any self-respecting Polish knight could be induced to go to the Holy Land, where, they had been informed, there was no wine, mead, or even beer to be had&quot;.

Initially, an attempt was made to convert the Prussians by peaceful means through special trading centers in which the pagans would become acquainted with the Christians. In the end, however, after not seeing much progress, it was decided that there should be a military expedition, which took place in 1222. However, the whole enterprise soon failed, especially when Swietopelk II withdrew his support mid-crusade. Swietopelk also gave refuge at his court to Władysław Odonic, who began his fight against his uncle Władysław III.

To cope with a challenge from the Prussians, the Piast rulers decided to create a &quot;Knight Guard&quot; (pl: &quot;stróże rycerskie&quot;) to protect their frontiers, for which knights from all of their domains were required to participate. But the concept of the Knight Guard collapsed by 1224 as a result of the defeat of the Lesser Poland knights, who suffered a surprise attack from the Prussians. The defeat and slaughter contributed significantly to the already cowardly attitude of the command of the Guard, a member of the Gryfici family, who was punished with exile.

In 1225, unhappy with this turn of events, the Gryfici conspired against Leszek and invited Henry I the Bearded to take the throne of Kraków, who for unknown reasons broke his previous alliance and, using Leszek&#x27;s involvement in Kievan Rus&#x27; affairs, appeared near Kraków. The war between Leszek and Henry I was preempted because of an attack on Lubusz by the Landgrave Louis IV of Thuringia, which forced Henry I to retreat. Before he could leave Lesser Poland his troops had wanted a clash with the forces of Leszek and Konrad at the Dłubnia River. Such a battle did not occur, however, because the opponents were able to conclude an agreement. It was recognized, though, that a return to the previous alliance and close cooperation that lasted from 1217 to 1224 would no longer be possible.

New complications occurred in 1227. In Greater Poland, Władysław III Spindleshanks was unable to deal with his nephew, Władysław Odonic. Leszek was personally interested in this conflict, as he still hoped to inherit the domains of the childless Władysław III. For unknown reasons, at some point Władysław Odonic lost the support of Swietopelk II, and thus he could not be sure of a victory. Therefore, it was unsurprising that both parties sought to end the conflict. Another problem that Leszek wanted to solve was the issue of the dangerous independent behavior of the Pomerelian Duke.

==Assassination==

A meeting of Polish Dukes was organized in the district of Gąsawa on the border of Kujawy and Greater Poland. Held in November 1227, it was attended by Leszek, Władysław Odonic, Henry I the Bearded, and Konrad I of Masovia - for unknown reasons, one of the most interested, Władysław III Spindleshanks, did not attend the meeting. The content of the talks was most likely the conduct of Świętopełk II of Pomerelia. On the morning of 24 November, the princes were attacked while they were bathing. Henry I was seriously wounded, but his life was saved by his faithful knight Peregrinus of Wiesenburg, who covered him with his own body. Leszek managed to escape half-naked on his horse to the nearby village of Marcinkowo, but the assassins caught up to him and killed him. The attackers have been postulated to be men of either Władysław Odonic or Świętopełk II, or some conspiracy involving both parties. Leszek&#x27;s body was transported to Kraków and buried in Wawel Cathedral on or before 6 December 1227.

The death of Leszek the White fundamentally changed the political situation in Poland. Despite his turbulent government, Leszek was the Duke of Kraków universally recognized by all the Polish princes. Świętopełk II declared himself independent from Polish vassalship upon Leszek&#x27;s death. Leszek&#x27;s son Bolesław V was only one year old upon his father&#x27;s death, and so the rule over Kraków and Lesser Poland was contested between Leszek&#x27;s brother Konrad I and Władysław III Spindleshanks, who was his heir according to the treaty of mutual inheritance made in 1217. Eventually Duke Henry I the Bearded of Silesia prevailed as High Duke in 1232.

==Marriage and issue==

Older historiography noted that Leszek married only once, to Grzymisława, daughter of Ingvar Yaroslavich, Prince of Lutsk in 1207. However, modern research now considers that he was married twice, firstly in 1207 or 1208 to a daughter of Prince Ingvar whose name is unknown, and after her repudiation, in 1210 or 1211 to Grzymisława, who was possibly a daughter of Yaroslav IV Vladimirovich, Prince of Novgorod. From his marriage to Grzymisława, Leszek had two children:

* Salomea (1211/12 – 17 November 1268), married in 1215 to Prince Coloman, son of King Andrew II of Hungary. They were the intended rulers of Galicia–Volhynia, but as noted above these plans failed and they never really established rule in that area. After her husband&#x27;s death (1241) she became a Poor Clare nun at Zawichost and Skała.
* Bolesław V the Chaste (21 June 1226 – 7 December 1279), who assumed the throne of Poland at Kraków in 1243.

==Church foundations==
In 1216 Leszek founded the Church of Saint Wenceslaus (pl: &quot;Kościół św. Wacława&quot;) in the city of Radom, which was further provided for by his son Bolesław V the Chaste, and in 1440 was extended and partially rebuilt in the Gothic style.

==Legacy==
He is rarely numbered (&quot;Leszek I&quot;), and his name is infrequently spelled &quot;Leszko&quot; or &quot;Lesco&quot;.

An opera about him, &quot;Leszek Biały&quot;, was written by Józef Elsner and performed in 1809.

<text>The 1991 British Columbia general election was the 35th provincial election in the Province of British Columbia, Canada. It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. The election was called on September 19, 1991, and held on October 17, 1991. The incumbent Social Credit Party of British Columbia, which had been beset by scandals during Bill Vander Zalm&#x27;s only term as premier, was defeated by the New Democratic Party of Mike Harcourt. Liberal Party leader Gordon Wilson surprised observers by leading his party to winning one-third of the votes cast, and forming the official opposition in the legislature after having held no seats at all since 1979. The new legislature met for the first time on March 17, 1992.

The election was held at the same time as a referendum on recall and initiative. It was also the first British Columbia general election with only single-member districts.

==Background==
Under Vander Zalm&#x27;s leadership, Socred&#x27;s control shifted from urban fiscal conservatives to social conservatives. Vander Zalm seemingly cruised to victory in the 1986 provincial election, held just a month after he was sworn in. In truth, however, a number of more moderate Socreds were not at home with the party&#x27;s rightward turn on social issues, and began defecting to the Liberals.

This process was exacerbated by Vander Zalm&#x27;s eccentricity, and the constant scandals that plagued his government. As well, Vander Zalm allowed his principal secretary, David Poole, to amass a substantial amount of power, despite being unelected.

Vander Zalm resigned in April 1991 amid a conflict of interest scandal surrounding the sale of a theme park that he owned. Socred members elected the lesser-known Deputy Premier Rita Johnston, a close ally of Vander Zalm, to be their new leader, over Grace McCarthy, a longtime associate of former Premier Bill Bennett. Many viewed this as a mistake, as Johnston was close to the Vander Zalm legacy; even NDP leader Mike Harcourt admitted later that he preferred Johnston over McCarthy, as the latter would be a much tougher opponent in an election.

==Campaign==
Johnston had little time to make up ground in the polls or distance herself from the now-detested Vander Zalm. Additionally, the Socreds were still bitterly divided over the bruising leadership contest. The NDP went into the elections as heavy favourites after leading in opinion polls for almost four years.

The Liberals, who had not been represented in the legislature since 1979, gained slightly in the polls due to great resentment against the ruling Socreds and skepticism towards the NDP. A turning point came when Wilson successfully took legal action to be included in the televised leaders&#x27; debate, which took place on 8 October. During the debate Johnston and Harcourt exchanged many bitter attacks, while Wilson, still not considered a serious contender, was able to successfully portray himself as an &quot;outsider&quot; who was above the partisan bickering of the other two parties. Liberal support surged dramatically as a result of Wilson&#x27;s performance. One of the memorable moments of the debate came as Harcourt and Johnston argued loudly amongst each other, when Wilson pointed towards them and declared, &quot;Here&#x27;s a classic example of why nothing ever gets done in the province of British Columbia.&quot;

==Opinion polls==
===Riding-specific polls===
====Oak Bay-Gordon Head by-election====
==Results==
The Socreds were swept from power in a massive NDP landslide. This was not due to the NDP winning a higher percentage of the vote as much as it was due to Socred support collapsing in favour of the BC Liberals, splitting the vote. The defeat was magnified by moderate Socred supporters voting Liberal, continuing a shift that dated to early in Vander Zalm&#x27;s tenure. The combined effect was to decimate the Socred caucus, which was reduced from 47 members to only seven—only three over the minimum for official party status. Johnston herself lost her own seat in Surrey-Newton to NDP challenger Penny Priddy, and all but five members of her cabinet were defeated.

The Liberals returned to the legislature as the official opposition after a 12-year absence, replacing Social Credit as the main alternative to the NDP in the province.

Notes:
x - less than 0.005% of the popular vote.

* Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election.

==Legacy==
This was considered a political realignment due to the high turnover in MLAs and the effective end of the Socreds as a political force. The party was completely shut out of the legislature in the 1996 election, never to return. Meanwhile, the Liberals replaced them as the main non-socialist party in British Columbia. The NDP and Liberals would go on to be the two main parties in the province until 2024, when the Liberals, who by then had renamed themselves BC United, withdrew from that year&#x27;s general election and endorsed the Conservative Party of British Columbia.

However, neither Harcourt, Wilson, or Johnston would contest the subsequent 1996 election as leaders of the major parties, with Johnston and Harcourt having retired from politics by that campaign. Johnston, having lost her seat, resigned the leadership of the Socreds immediately in early 1992. Harcourt resigned as premier in 1996 due to a scandal among the MLAs in his caucus. Wilson proved unable to consolidate the party&#x27;s leadership due to inexperience and he was eventually deposed in 1993, and he crossed to the NDP in 1997 after a brief spell as founder, leader and sole MLA of the Progressive Democratic Alliance. He served as an MLA and minister until his defeat in 2001. Wilson was also a candidate for the NDP&#x27;s leadership in 2000, won by Ujjal Dosanjh.

<text>Doris Grau (October 12, 1924 – December 30, 1995) was an American actress and script supervisor from Brooklyn. After moving to Hollywood in 1940, she began her career supervising film and television scripts. She continued to do this until the 1990s and worked on films such as &quot;Point Blank&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot; and television shows such as &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Grau did some acting in her later years, playing live-action and animated roles. On the sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, she worked as a script supervisor and provided the voice of Lunchlady Doris and other minor characters.

==Early life==
Grau was born on October 12, 1924, in Brooklyn, New York. She moved to the Hollywood district in Los Angeles, California, as a teenager in 1940. There she was soon hired as a script supervisor for the production company Columbia Pictures.

==Career==
Grau supervised the script of the 1967 crime film &quot;Point Blank&quot;, which revolves around a man named Walker (played by Lee Marvin) who sets out to find his friend who betrayed him during a robbery that they performed together and left with all the money for himself. Grau was also the script supervisor of the 1976 remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;. She then supervised the scripts of the films &quot;The Champ&quot; (1979), &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; (1979), &quot;The Hunter&quot; (1980), &quot;The Pursuit of D. B. Cooper&quot; (1981), &quot;Caveman&quot; (1981), &quot;Clue&quot; (1985), &quot;Marie&quot; (1985), and &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1987). In the 1980s, she also supervised scripts of the television show &quot;Coward of the County&quot; (1982) and the television films &quot;The Shadow Riders&quot; (1983), &quot;Missing Children: A Mother&#x27;s Story&quot; (1983), &quot;Kenny Rogers as The Gambler: The Adventure Continues&quot; (1984), &quot;Velvet&quot; (1984), and &quot;My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn&quot; (1985).

In 1986, Grau played a role in the television series &quot;All Is Forgiven&quot;. Between 1986 and 1987, she played the character Corinne in a few episodes of the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, a show on which she had previously worked as script supervisor during seasons one and four. Grau worked as a script supervisor on Fox Broadcasting Company&#x27;s &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; (1987–1990), a variety show that featured among many things the first appearance of the fictional animated Simpson family. This family was later given their own animated series on Fox, called &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in 1989. Grau worked on that show as a script supervisor as well. Grau also voiced some characters in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. She is best known for lending her voice to Lunchlady Doris, who speaks with a &quot;gruff voice&quot; according to &quot;The Journal Gazette&quot; editor Dean Robinson. This character appeared on the show with Grau&#x27;s voice between 1991 and 1997. Grau also worked as an actress on the animated series &quot;The Critic&quot; that was created by writers of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 1994. She voiced the chain-smoking character Doris Grossman, who is the make-up artist for the main character of the show.

In 1992, Grau appeared in the supporting role of Hattie Rifkin in the film &quot;The Distinguished Gentleman&quot;. According to Philip Wuntch, film critic for &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, Grau &quot;has only a few lines as a senior citizen with old-time political savvy, but she makes every vocal inflection count.&quot; &quot;The Patriot-News&quot; Sharon Johnson called her &quot;a delight as the feisty senior citizens&#x27; lobbyist who first recognizes Johnson as a winner.&quot;

Grau worked as a script supervisor on the sitcom &quot;Good Advice&quot; in 1993, and played characters in the sitcoms &quot;Phenom&quot; and &quot;The George Carlin Show&quot; in 1994. One of her last film appearances was a minor role in the 1995 film &quot;Babe&quot;, which is about a pig who wants to be a sheepdog. She also appeared as the character Rose in the 1995 film &quot;Coldblooded&quot; that tells the story of a member of the Mob who is promoted to hitman against his will.

==Death==
On December 30, 1995, aged 71, Grau died from respiratory failure at a hospital in Hollywood. &quot;Team Homer&quot;, an episode of the seventh season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; that aired on January 7, 1996, was dedicated to her memory. Because some episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; are produced long before they air, Grau&#x27;s last appearance on the show was in the season 9 episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Sax&quot; (an episode originally produced for season 7) that aired on October 19, 1997. Her character, Lunchlady Doris on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was retired out of respect (similar to the retirement of Phil Hartman&#x27;s characters). However, the character returned to the show after a decade-long absence in 2006 (voiced by Tress MacNeille and renamed Lunchlady Dora.)

<doc id="653508" wikidata="Q653847" url="?curid=653508" title="Richard Halliburton">
<text>Richard Halliburton (January 9, 1900 – presumed dead after March 24, 1939) was an American travel writer and adventurer who swam the length of the Panama Canal and paid the lowest toll in its history—36 cents in 1928. He disappeared at sea while attempting to sail the Chinese junk &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; across the Pacific Ocean from Hong Kong to the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco, California.

==Early life and education==
Richard Halliburton was born in Brownsville, Tennessee, to Wesley Halliburton, a civil engineer and real estate speculator, and Nelle Nance Halliburton. A brother, Wesley Jr., was born in 1903. The family moved to Memphis, where the brothers, who were not close, spent their childhood. Richard attended Memphis University School, where his favorite subjects were geography and history; he also showed promise as a violinist, and was a fair golfer and tennis player. In 1915 he developed a rapid heartbeat and spent some four months in bed before its symptoms were relieved. This included some time at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan, run by the eccentric and innovative John Harvey Kellogg, whose philosophy of care featured regular exercise, sound nutrition, and frequent enemas. In 1917, following an apparent bout of rheumatic fever, Wesley Jr., thought strong and in fine health, suddenly died.

At 5&#x27;7&quot; (170 cm) and about 140 pounds (64 kg), Halliburton was never robust but would seldom complain of sickness or poor stamina. He graduated from the Lawrenceville School in 1917, where he was chief editor of &quot;The Lawrence&quot;. In 1921 he graduated from Princeton University, where he was on the editorial board of &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot; and chief editor of &quot;The Princetonian Pictorial Magazine&quot;. He also attended courses in public speaking and considered a career as a lecturer.

==Career==

===&quot;An even tenor&quot;===

Leaving college temporarily during 1919, Halliburton became an ordinary seaman and boarded the freighter &quot;Octorara&quot; that July, bound from New Orleans to England. He toured historic places in London and Paris, but soon returned to Princeton in early 1920 to finish his schooling. His trip inspired in him a lust for even more travel; seizing the day became his credo. The words of Oscar Wilde, who in works like &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; enjoined experiencing the moment before it vanished, inspired Halliburton to reject marriage, family, a regular job, and conventional respectability as the obvious steps after graduation. He liked bachelorhood, youthful adventure, and the thrill of the unknown. To earn a living he intended to write about his adventures. He dedicated his first book to his Princeton roommates, &quot;...whose sanity, consistency and respectability ... drove [him] to this book&quot;.

Halliburton&#x27;s father advised him to get the wanderlust out of his system, return to Memphis and adjust his life to &quot;an even tenor&quot;:
&quot;I &quot;hate&quot; that expression&quot;, Richard responded, expressing the view that distinguished his life-style, &quot;and as far as I am able I intend to avoid that condition. When impulse and spontaneity fail to make my way uneven then I shall sit up nights inventing means of making my life as conglomerate and vivid as possible... And when my time comes to die, I&#x27;ll be able to die happy, for I will have done and seen and heard and experienced all the joy, pain and thrills—any emotion that any human ever had—and I&#x27;ll be especially happy if I am spared a stupid, common death in bed.

===Witness to the wedding of the emperor of China===
In 1922 Halliburton witnessed the last ceremonial marriage of a Chinese Emperor, the wedding of Emperor Puyi to Empress Wanrong in Beijing. The Royal Family would be permanently expelled less than 2 years later. Halliburton wrote of the event in his memoir as follows: 
===Lecturer and pioneer of adventure journalism===
While Halliburton was attending Princeton, &quot;Field and Stream&quot; magazine paid him $150 for an article (). This initial success encouraged him to choose travel writing as a career. His fortunes changed when a representative of the Feakins Agency heard him deliver a talk, and soon Halliburton was given bookings for lectures. Despite a high-pitched voice and occasional discomfort on the details, Halliburton displayed such enthusiasm and recounted such vivid recreations of his often bizarre foreign encounters that he became popular with audiences. On the strength of his lecturing and increasing celebrity appeal, publisher Bobbs-Merrill, whose editor-in-chief David Laurance Chambers was also a Princeton graduate, accepted Halliburton&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Royal Road to Romance&quot; (1925), which became a bestseller.

Two years later he published &quot;The Glorious Adventure&quot;, which retraced Ulysses&#x27; adventures throughout the Classical Greek world as recounted in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and included his visiting the grave of English poet Rupert Brooke on the island of Skyros. In 1929, Halliburton published &quot;New Worlds To Conquer&quot;, which recounted his famous swim of the Panama Canal, his retracing the track of Hernán Cortés&#x27; conquest of Mexico, and his enactment in full goat-skin costume, of the role of Robinson Crusoe in Alexander Selkirk&#x27;s, &quot;cast away&quot; on the island of Tobago. Animals figure prominently in this and many other of Halliburton&#x27;s adventures.

===Ascent to fame===
Halliburton&#x27;s friends during this time included movie stars, writers, musicians, painters, and politicians, including writers Gertrude Atherton and Kathleen Norris, Senator James Phelan, philanthropist Noël Sullivan, and actors Ramón Novarro and Rod La Rocque. Casual acquaintances were many, as lectures, personal appearances (notably to promote &quot;India Speaks&quot;), syndicated columns, and radio broadcasts made him a household name associated with romantic travel.

Halliburton was acquainted with swashbuckling cinema star Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., who was also a world traveler. Halliburton himself, though several times approached about film versions of his adventures (notably by Fox Film Corporation in 1933 for &quot;The Royal Road to Romance&quot;), only appeared in one movie, the Walter Futter-produced semi-documentary &quot;India Speaks&quot; (1932; re-released in 1947 as &quot;Bride of Buddha&quot; or &quot;Bride of the East&quot;).

===&quot;Flying Carpet&quot; Expedition===

In 1930 Halliburton hired pioneer aviator Moye Stephens on the strength of a handshake for no pay, but unlimited expenses—to fly him around the world in an open cockpit biplane. The modified Stearman C-3B was named the &quot;Flying Carpet&quot; after the magic carpet of fairy tales, subsequently the title of his 1932 best-seller. They embarked on &quot;one of the most fantastic, extended air journeys ever recorded&quot; taking 18 months to circumnavigate the globe, covering 33,660 miles (54,100 km) and visiting 34 countries.

The pair started on Christmas Day 1930, making stops along the way, from Los Angeles to New York City, where they crated the airplane and boarded it on the oceanliner RMS &quot;Majestic&quot;. They sailed to England, where their extended mission began. They flew to France, then Spain, the British possession of Gibraltar, and on to Africa at Fez, Morocco (where Stephens performed aerobatics for the first air meet held in that country). They crossed the Atlas Mountains and set out across the Sahara to Timbuktu, using the fuel caches of the Shell Oil Company. While in Timbuktu, they were guests of Pere Yakouba, a French Augustinian friar who had fled years before from the distractions of modern society and become a patriarch and a noted scholar of the community. They flew to their destination without mishap, then continued northward and eastward, spending several weeks in Algeria with the French Foreign Legion, and continuing via Cairo and Damascus, with a side trip to Petra.
In Persia (now Iran) they met German aviator Elly Beinhorn, who was grounded by mechanical problems. They assisted her and then worked out shared itineraries. Later, Halliburton wrote a foreword to her book &quot;Flying Girl&quot; about the adventures she had in the air. In spite of being exhausted, and their plane becoming less safe, Stephens and Halliburton continued their eastward journey. In Persia, they took Crown Princess Mahin Banu for a ride in the airplane; in neighbouring Iraq, they gave the young Crown Prince Ghazi a ride, flying him over his school yard.

In India, Halliburton visited the Taj Mahal, which he had first visited in 1922. In Nepal, as &quot;The Flying Carpet&quot; flew past Mount Everest, Halliburton stood up in the open cockpit of the plane and took the first aerial photograph of the mountain, and to the delight of an amazed Maharajah of Nepal, Stephens and Beinhorn performed daring aerobatics. In Borneo, Halliburton and Stephens were feted by Sylvia Brett, wife of the White Rajah of Sarawak. They gave her a ride, making Ranee Sylvia the first woman to fly in that country. At the Rajang River, they took the chief of the Dyak head hunters for a flight; he gave them 60 kilos of shrunken heads, which they dared not refuse but dumped as soon as possible. They were the first Americans to fly to the Philippines; after arriving in Manila on April 27, the plane was again loaded onto a ship () to cross the ocean. They flew the final leg from San Francisco to Los Angeles. A fictionalized account of his travels in India and Asia was depicted in the 1933 film &quot;India Speaks&quot;.

Moye Stephens was a skilled pilot. Halliburton, in a reassuring letter to his parents (January 23, 1932), recited his many flight skills. Stephens, for instance, during one aerobatic display, astutely aborted a slow roll the moment he realized that Halliburton had not fastened his seat belt. Stephens later became chief test pilot of the Northrop Flying Wing, which evolved into today&#x27;s B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. The around-the-world trip had cost Halliburton over $50,000, plus fuel. In the first year, the book, entitled &quot;The Flying Carpet&quot; (after his valiant plane) earned him royalties of $100,000, in those depression-era days a remarkably large sum. Barbara H. Schultz&#x27;s &quot;Flying Carpets, Flying Wings – The Biography of Moye Stephens&quot; (2011), besides recounting the Flying Carpet Expedition from a flier&#x27;s viewpoint and documenting Stephens&#x27; (1906–1995) contributions to aviation history, contains Stephens&#x27; extended reports of the adventure. With rare glimpses into the travel writer&#x27;s art, these give historic balance to Halliburton&#x27;s often romanticized renditions.

===Commissioned research travel and feature article writing===
Early in 1934 the Bell Syndicate Newspapers contracted with newspapers throughout the United States, beginning with the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, to publish weekly feature stories prepared by Halliburton. About one thousand words each with pictures, ultimately fifty stories resulted. Among these were stories about the Seri Indians of Southern California, Fort Jefferson, where Dr. Samuel Mudd, convicted of conspiracy in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, was imprisoned; Admiral Richmond Pearson Hobson, who deliberately sank his own ship during the Spanish–American War, the Battle of Santiago de Cuba a month later; Henri Christophe and the Citadelle Laferrière in Haiti; Christopher Columbus, Lord Byron, and &quot;The Girl from Martinique Who Wrecked Napoleon&quot;. Paid well, to fulfill his end of the deal, Halliburton traveled extensively to Cuba, Haiti, Martinique, Miami, Washington, D. C. (to do research at the Library of Congress), to New York, Europe, and finally to Russia.

At the height of his popularity, he appeared on radio, attended celebrity parties (including one at the home of novelist Kathleen Norris who also wrote stories that appeared regularly in the newspapers). After the purchasing a used Ford roadster, he explored the heartland of California and the beauties of the Lake Tahoe area. Other commissions followed: United Artists was producing a movie about Benvenuto Cellini; they asked him to do a story on the Renaissance artist&#x27;s love life. Halliburton also gave frequent lectures and even turned down offers; a radio company offered him the considerable sum of $500 a week for 26 weeks, &quot;to speak on a beer program&quot;. The &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot;, and newspapers in Milwaukee, Kansas City, Columbus, and Toronto published his syndicated stories.

At the end of the year, Halliburton returned to Europe to fulfill his dream of emulating Hannibal by crossing the Alps on an elephant - one chosen for the task from a Paris zoo named &quot;Miss Dalrymple&quot;, going from Martigny (Switzerland) to Aosta (Italy).
The following year Bobbs-Merrill published Halliburton&#x27;s &quot;Seven League Boots&quot;, filled with his latest adventures and arguably the last of the great travel works of the classic period.

===Hangover House in Laguna Beach, California===
In 1937 William Alexander Levy designed a house for Halliburton in Laguna Beach, California, which is now known as &quot;a landmark of modern architecture&quot;. Alexander was a novice architect, a recent graduate of the New York University School of Architecture and close friend of Paul Mooney. Mooney managed the construction of the house. The house, built of concrete and steel, fortress-like in appearance, contains a spacious living room and dining room and three bedrooms: one for Halliburton, which featured a wall-sized map of the world, one for Mooney and one for Levy. Because of its position, perched 400 feet (120m) above a sheer canyon, it was called &quot;Hangover House&quot; by Mooney, and this title was cast into a retaining wall on the site. Writer Ayn Rand, who visited the house in 1937 while still an unknown writer, is believed to have based the &quot;Heller House&quot; in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1943) upon Halliburton&#x27;s house.

===&quot;Sea Dragon&quot; expedition and disappearance===
On September 23, 1938, Halliburton boarded the , bound for Hong Kong. From Hong Kong he intended to sail a Chinese junk across the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. The junk, named the &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; (), was an essentially a Wenchow-style junk, in length, modified to Halliburton&#x27;s specifications and built in the shipyards of Kowloon by shipwright Fat Kau. Its stern was emblazoned with a colorful dragon, its interior hull was equipped with a diesel engine; the &quot;Sea Dragon&quot;, a dramatic symbol of East meeting West, was to be an attraction at the Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE) in San Francisco (at Treasure Island); there, after its three-month voyage across the Pacific, it would dock and, for a small admission fee, take fair-goers on excursions around San Francisco Bay.

According to Halliburton&#x27;s first cousin, whom he visited in 1938, the trip was meant, in part, to renew interest in Halliburton whose fame at the time was in decline. Biographers credit the idea for the voyage to Walter Gaines Swanson, who, as the Exposition&#x27;s public relations manager, promoted its goal of celebrating both the Oakland and Golden Gate bridges as well as the cultures of the Pacific rim. Despite having an interest in sailing craft since childhood, Halliburton had little practical navigation experience. Seeking capable leadership, he hired veteran mariner John Wenlock Welch as his captain and Henry von Fehren as his engineer. Besides Halliburton&#x27;s secretary Paul Mooney, the initial crew included George Barstow III, a 21-year-old student at Juilliard, Dartmouth &quot;lads&quot; John Rust Potter, Robert Hill Chase, and Gordon Ellicott Torrey. The crew composition would change; engineer&#x27;s assistant Richard L. Davis would bow out, ship&#x27;s cook James Sligh, and able-bodied seamen Ralph Granrud and Benjamin Flagg would be added and a last-minute entry, student globetrotter Velman Fitch of the University of Minnesota. A Chinese messboy, a Chinese bosun and two Chinese sailors completed the crew.

After he inspected a number of junks along the China coast, finding most either too expensive or wholly unseaworthy, Halliburton decided to have a junk built. Although it took less than six weeks to complete; its construction was marked by cost overruns, delays, engineering errors, and what Halliburton perceived as the primitive work habits of the Chinese carpenters, issues prompting him to write, &quot;If any one of my readers wishes to be driven rapidly and violently insane, and doesn&#x27;t know how to go about it, let me make a suggestion: Try building a Chinese junk in a Chinese shipyard during a war with Japan.&quot; From the start, funding for the project was a main problem. The corporate sponsors whom Halliburton approached thought the risks of the enterprise greater than its rewards. Chinese venture capitalists in Chinatown thought it far too dangerous while China was torn by war and Buick refused to be associated with something called a &quot;junk&quot;. While the Sea Dragon Expedition was partly funded through: paid subscriptions for a projected series of progress reports that Halliburton intended to send from China, sales of commemorative tokens and other keepsakes, and expected tourist excursions. Major and immediate funding came from Halliburton&#x27;s wealthy relatives, including the wife of his cousin Erle Halliburton. $14,000 of the $26,500 raised ($300,000 to $400,000 in today&#x27;s money) came from the three crew members from Dartmouth: Robert Chase, John &quot;Brue&quot; Potter, and Gordon Torrey, who had extensive amateur sailing experience.

A trial run in January 1939 revealed the vessel&#x27;s flaws; the completed &quot;Sea Dragon,&quot; distinctly top heavy, rode precariously low, rolling and heeling in moderately active waters. Nevertheless, on January 27, Halliburton assured his subscribers that the dry deck of the craft indicated its buoyancy and, implicitly, its seaworthiness. To improve its stability, however, ten tons of concrete ballast were supposedly poured into its hull. There were other concerns. Many observers thought the heavy diesel engine, which released endangering fumes, was out of place aboard a vessel that traditionally sailed sufficiently without mechanical assistance. Moreover, Chief Officer Dale Collins of the , along with others noted that the masts and sails were far too heavy, and that the poop deck, meant to house a radio cabin and galley, was higher than befit a junk of its size. The first attempted voyage in February was forced to turn back on the 14th after a week at sea, due to an illness among the crew. For medical reasons, Potter stayed behind after the junk&#x27;s unsuccessful first voyage and later offered an account of his experiences, as did Torrey. Besides poor performance by the junk in rough seas, the February attempt was aborted due to an injury sustained by Potter when struck by the mainsail boom while handling the 18 foot (5.5m) tiller. Sea Dragon Expedition researcher Gerry Max has noted that Potter, as well as Torrey, who did not make the trip, and a couple of other crew members may have contracted gonorrhea during their time in Hong Kong at the start of the voyage. Dysentery also afflicted several crew members including Captain Welch. Halliburton himself suffered from a skin rash, the result perhaps of high anxiety, and nervous exhaustion. Days before the first crossing attempt, Mooney broke an ankle after falling down a ladder. Halliburton sent four letters to subscribers from Hong Kong between November 20, 1938, and February 16, 1939; the fifth, he promised, would be sent from Midway Island.
Hastily repaired and recaulked, the Sea Dragon left port once again on March 4, 1939. Recruits added to replace Potter and Torrey included able-bodied seamen Ben Flagg and Ralph Granrud, both in their early twenties. Globe-trotter Velman Fitch, whose seaman skills were uncertain, hitched a ride at the last minute. The first few weeks of the voyage, if uneventful, went according to plan. Calamity struck on March 23, three weeks out to sea, when the ship headed into a typhoon approximately west of Midway, where it was due to call on April 3. The closest friendly ship to the junk was the liner &quot;President Coolidge,&quot; 400 miles (640 km) away, and 1,180 miles (1,900 km) west of Midway Island, itself battling huge seas. It was presumed to be on its way to rendezvous with the beleaguered craft. Among the radio messages the liner received from the junk&#x27;s Captain Welch was an ironically cheerful one: &quot;Having a wonderful time. Wish you were here instead of me.&quot; As noted by the &quot;Coolidge,&quot; waves during those dire moments were estimated at high. The next message was different: &quot;Southerly gale. Heavy Rain Squalls. High sea. Barometer 29.46. True course 100. Speed 5.5 knots. Position 1200 GCT 31.10 north 155.00 east. All well. When closer may we avail ourselves of your direction finder. Regards Welch.&quot; That was the last message heard from the junk.

Until then, Halliburton had kept regular, if sporadic, contact with radio stations and trans-Pacific Ocean liners. At first the Coast Guard at Hawaii delayed searching for the missing ship, possibly thinking Halliburton staged his disappearance as a publicity stunt. After the &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; was a week overdue to call at Midway, on April 10, friends petitioned the Coast Guard to send a search vessel. A Yugoslavian freighter, , was the first to arrive at the last reported position of &quot;Sea Dragon&quot;, on April 16. Later in May, an extensive US Navy search with several ships and scout planes, including , scouring over the course of many days, found no trace of the junk or the crew, and the effort was ended. By June, Halliburton&#x27;s mother abandoned hope that he would be found alive. As with Amelia Earhart, many rumors and reports of Halliburton&#x27;s fate continued to arise over the years, with fans hoping he might yet turn up alive.

The ocean liner , captained by Charles Jokstad, passed flotsam in the middle of the Pacific, covered with an estimated one year&#x27;s growth of barnacles in 1940, believed to be from the wreck of the &quot;Sea Dragon&quot;, perhaps the ship&#x27;s rudder. Later, in 1945 a 30-foot skeleton of a 150-foot boat of oriental design, mistaken by some as that of the 75-foot &quot;Sea Dragon&quot;, washed ashore in San Diego, California.
Missing at sea since March 1939, Halliburton was declared dead on October 5, 1939, by the Memphis Chancery Court. His empty grave is at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis at the Halliburton family gravesite. His ghost is reputed to haunt his final residence, Hangover House, completed in 1938 by architect William Alexander Levy in Laguna Beach.

==Personal life==
Halliburton never married. In his teens he dated several young women and, as revealed in letters to them, was infatuated with at least two of them. As an adult, his companions were chiefly male. Among those romantically linked to him were film star Ramón Novarro and philanthropist Noël Sullivan, both of whom enjoyed, as Halliburton did, a bohemian lifestyle. Halliburton&#x27;s most enduring relationship was with freelance journalist Paul Mooney, with whom he often shared living quarters and who assisted him with his written work. French police reports, dated 1935, noted the famed traveler&#x27;s homosexual activity when in Paris at about the time of his planned crossing by elephant over the Alps: &quot;Mr Halliburton is a homosexual well known in some specialized establishments. He is in the habit of soliciting on Saint-Lazare Street&quot; (near the station of the same name).

===Private writing===
Halliburton admired English poet Rupert Brooke (1887–1915), whose beauty and patriotic verse captivated a generation. Halliburton intended to write his biography and kept ample notes for the task, interviewing in person or corresponding with prominent British literary and salon figures who had known Brooke, including Lady Violet Asquith Bonham-Carter, Walter de la Mare, Cathleen Nesbitt, Noel Olivier, Alec Waugh, and Virginia Woolf. Halliburton never began the book, but his notes were used by Arthur Springer to write &quot;Red Wine of Youth—A Biography of Rupert Brooke&quot; (New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1952).

A vigorous correspondent, Halliburton wrote numerous letters to fans, friends, editors, sponsors, and literary acquaintances. To his parents alone, he wrote well over a thousand letters; a large selection of these, edited in part by his father Wesley, was published in 1940 by Bobbs-Merrill as &quot;Richard Halliburton: His Story of His Life&#x27;s Adventure As Told to His Mother and Father&quot;.

==Character of published work==
In his colorful and simply-told travel adventures Halliburton was the &quot;innocent abroad&quot;, receptive to new ideas which he in turn expressed with a quiet erudition. Throughout his creative life he displayed a romantic readiness that shone through his best prose, prose at once picturesque, gently informative, extroverted, and personally confiding. He often described his attaching himself to a famous historic person (or key event for which that person was known) or to a revered place, such as the Taj Mahal. Acting as sort of an emcee, or performing some often cleverly garish stunt, he recalled that person and invoked a place associated with him; by so doing, he escorted readers to a different time and locale, with some reflective asides added into his narrative for perspective. Accordingly he duplicated Hannibal&#x27;s crossing of the Alps by elephant – naming the pachyderm he had gotten from a Paris zoo Miss Elysabethe Dalrymple; he emulated Ulysses&#x27; myriad adventures in the Mediterranean dressed often as a beach-comber or playboy; he re-enacted Robinson Crusoe&#x27;s island solitude, adopting a menagerie of domestic pets with names such as Listerine, Kitty and Susie. Examples of this cultural self-enlistment filled his work and helped define his public image. Of further note, he retraced the fateful expedition of Hernando Cortez to the heart of the Aztec Empire, like his hero Lord Byron, he swam the Hellespont, metaphorically bridging Europe and Asia, and he lived among the French Foreign Legion in North Africa.

Halliburton was an early proponent of what Susan Sontag in her essay &quot;Notes on &#x27;Camp&#x27;&quot; tagged &quot;the theatricalization of experience.&quot; He did not just view legendary places and landscapes, but dramatized them, often by performing, in relationship to them, some athletic feat ultimately intended to thrill armchair travelers as well as to educate them: he swam the Panama Canal, climbed the Matterhorn and Mount Fuji (achieving its first documented winter ascent), and twice he descended into the Mayan Well of Death, the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza. The occasional trouble that he received from authorities only contributed to the excitement of his adventures. Such run-ins occurred when he breached security to take photos of the guns at Gibraltar and was arrested; again, when he attempted to enter Mecca, which is forbidden to non-Muslims; and yet again when he snuck past the gatekeepers at the Taj Mahal where, beneath a moonlit sky, he indulged in a swim in the sacred pool that faced the worshiped tomb.

Halliburton&#x27;s books were meant for the general reading public. Into households across America, they brought the world&#x27;s many divergent peoples and cultures. Racist comments their author made, though for the time not unique to him, when revisited today, are unsettling. At times ethnocentric, he thought it &quot;extraordinary&quot; that &quot;such a primitive race&quot; as the Seri Indians residing in Lower California &quot;should live so close to (presumably civilized) Hollywood.&quot; Of the blending of races and cultures he encountered, Halliburton attempted to be descriptive rather than judgmental. Still, intrigued by the &quot;slim Sonias&quot; working in Blood Alley in Shanghai, he seemed both amused and dismayed by the interracial mingling that their physical appearances suggested to him: &quot;When Chinese blood and foreign blood are mixed, especially if the foreign blood is Russian, Portuguese or French, the devastating result is something to write home about.&quot; Halliburton&#x27;s ideas on miscegenation are traceable partly to racist notions prevalent in his day. One source was Lothrop Stoddard&#x27;s &quot;The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy&quot; (1920), a popular book in its day. Regarding marriage and matrimonial customs—what he calls &quot;the sex-mysteries,&quot; Halliburton could be both matter-of-fact and ingenuously outspoken. In Borneo he notes that for the Dyaks &quot;free love is not only accepted, but encouraged,&quot; and, after describing their courtship rituals, remarks that &quot;in this utterly natural society there is no such thing as prostitution or repression.&quot;

Halliburton&#x27;s love of the world&#x27;s natural wonders, and such monuments of mankind that seemed best to compliment those wonders, derives in part from the Romanticism of poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. His admiration may have been piqued by his exposure at Princeton to English Professor Henry Van Dyke, a popular essayist and poet of his time who was also a teacher of Halliburton&#x27;s editor, David Laurance Chambers. Like them, Halliburton took a dim view of technology, and he gently urged that one see the world&#x27;s marvels before &quot;modern Progress&quot; obliterated them.

Halliburton was a cultural relativist. Believing that &quot;culture was king,&quot; he adhered to the credibility of multiple perspectives. The attitude may explain in part his adopting the garb of a particular region by &quot;going native,&quot; and in general his welcoming regard for the nuances of differing cultural identities and mores. As a sort of cultural ambassador, he met high-end government officials and heads of state from Peruvian dictator Augusto Leguia, to British Ambassador to Italy (during World War I) James Rennell Rodd, to Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, to the Last Emperor of China, to King Feisal al Husain of Iraq and his son the Crown Prince.

Over time Halliburton&#x27;s social and political views shifted. An early letter (1923) expressed his &quot;virulent antipathy for democracy as practiced in America&quot; and a hatred &quot;for the laboring class&quot;, but these views contrast with the plight he shared with the abused prisoners at Devil&#x27;s Island, and is evident in some early maritime adventures of working alongside rough-hewn seamen. In &quot;Straight Talk From Russia,&quot; in &quot;Seven League Boots&quot; (1935), he contrasted the suspension of freedoms in the Communist nation to the freedoms people enjoyed in democratic America, exuberantly praising the latter.

Halliburton&#x27;s last works (done in collaboration with journalist Paul Mooney), notably &quot;The Letters from the Sea Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Log of the Sea Dragon&quot;, both of which offer asides of Japan&#x27;s hostile presence in China, suggest the war-reportorial course his writing might have taken had he lived. A news correspondent&#x27;s role is also suggested by his skilled interview with the executioner of the Romanovs, the last ruling dynasty of Russia. Distinguished by their readerliness, the essays on historic persons which appeared in both his books and newspaper articles, specifically of Spanish–American War hero Captain Richard Hobson and of Haitian leader Henri Christophe, show the skills of a natural biographer, and offer a further hint of career evolution.

==Legacy==
Publisher James O&#x27;Reilly, who reissued &quot;The Royal Road to Romance&quot; to celebrate the centenary of Halliburton&#x27;s birth, characterized the author-adventurer thus: &quot;From the Jazz Age through the Great Depression to the eve of World War II, he thrilled an entire generation of readers.&quot; He was &quot;clever, resourceful, undaunted, cheerful in the face of dreadful odds, ever-optimistic about the world and the people around him, always scheming about his next adventure.&quot;
He wrote that Halliburton&#x27;s &quot;manhood spanned the brief interval between the two World Wars&quot; and acclaims him as a &quot;spokesman for the youth of a generation&quot;. Halliburton insisted throughout his career on the importance of travel abroad as a means of self-improvement and discovery. He was an advocate by example of the &#x27;grand tour&#x27; championed by monarchs and the upper classes from the days of Henry VIII through to the Belle Epoque, and he championed the study abroad programs featured in the curricula of many colleges and universities.

Halliburton wanted to be remembered as the most-traveled man who ever lived, but he was surpassed by the contemporary globetrotters and influences, Burton Holmes and Harry Franck. In his day he had few rivals, though Carveth Wells (&quot;Adventure!&quot;), Eugene Wright (&quot;The Great Horn Spoon&quot;) and Martin and Osa Johnson (&quot;Safari&quot;) could equally captivate. Called the &quot;Richard Halliburton of the occult,&quot; William Seabrook (1884-1945) (&quot;Jungle Ways&quot;) commanded nearly as wide a readership.

For contemporaries Thomas Wolfe, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Corey Ford and Ernest Hemingway, Halliburton held some literary (and for humorist Ford, some satiric) appeal. Writers Paul Theroux, Jim Harrison and Susan Sontag, among others, acknowledged debts of gratitude for his influence on their work. Television news celebrity and author Walter Cronkite, who heard him lecture in the mid-1930s, credited Halliburton with steering him to a career in journalism. As the writer of a succession of bestsellers, and as a popular lecturer, Halliburton figured prominently in educating several generations of young Americans in the rudiments of geography, history and culture, especially through his two &quot;Books of Marvels&quot;, re-issued in one volume after his death.
Two structures commemorate Halliburton: Hangover House in Laguna Beach, California, and the Memorial Tower at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee. Architecture historian and writer Ted Wells considers Hangover House, which Halliburton commissioned, to be one of the &quot;best modern houses in the United States&quot;. Nearly a quarter century after Halliburton&#x27;s disappearance, his father donated $400,000 to build an imposing bell tower. It was dedicated in 1962 as the Richard Halliburton Memorial Tower; the elder man died the following year at age 95.

In his &quot;Second Book of Marvels&quot;, Halliburton stated, &quot;Astronomers say that the Great Wall is the only man-made thing on our planet visible to the human eye from the moon.&quot; Although untrue, this statement was a possible source for the urban legend that the Great Wall of China could be seen from space.

The Richard Halliburton Papers are held at Princeton University Library and the Richard Halliburton Collection at Paul Barret, Jr. Library at Rhodes College.

Beginning with Gerry Max&#x27;s &quot;Horizon Chasers: The Lives and Adventures of Richard Halliburton and Paul Mooney&quot;, published in 2007, a succession of books about Halliburton has appeared. John Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Journalism&#x27;s Roving Eye: A History of American Newsgathering Abroad&quot;, published in 2009, devotes considerable space to Halliburton and his contemporaries in the travel writing field. &quot;The Forgotten Adventures of Richard Halliburton: A High Flying Life from Tennessee to Timbuktu&quot; by R. Scott Williams appeared in 2014, &quot;American Daredevil: The Extraordinary Life of Richard Halliburton, the World&#x27;s First Celebrity Travel Writer&quot; by Cathryn J. Prince in 2016, and &quot;Richard Halliburton and the Voyage of the Sea Dragon&quot; by Gerry Max in 2020. Of interest is Garrett Drake&#x27;s fictional &quot;The Secret of the King&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (one of a series) subtitled &quot;a Richard Halliburton Adventure&quot; (Green E-Book, 2019). Also of interest is Ruth Wolff&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sea Dragon&quot; (Xlibris, c2021).

The World War II liberty ship was named in his honor.

<doc id="653513" wikidata="Q4986149" url="?curid=653513" title="Bugdom">
<text>Bugdom is a 1999 platform video game developed and published by Pangea Software for Mac OS 9. It was included with the iMac DV 2000 and later iBook models.

&quot;Bugdom&quot; was ported to Microsoft Windows by Hoplite Research and released in 2000 by On Deck Interactive, a division of Gathering of Developers. Following the acquisition of Gathering by Take-Two Interactive in 2002, the game was ported again by Ideas From the Deep. However, Take-Two Interactive apparently continued publishing illegal copies of &quot;Bugdom&quot;, prompting Ideas From the Deep to contact the FBI&#x27;s crime division. Despite this, Take-Two Interactive continued to publish copies following the debate.

&quot;Bugdom&quot; was generally well received by critics, being praised for its graphics, gameplay and soundtrack but criticized for certain technical glitches as well as gameplay repetition, and sold fairly well.

A sequel, Bugdom 2, was released on December 30, 2002.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Bugdom&quot; is a third-person 3D platformer in which the player controls the main character Rollie McFly through ten different stages set in the Bugdom, namely a lawn, a pond, a forest which resembles a bug&#x27;s interpretation of a garden, a beehive, a nighttime-themed level, and an anthill.

Rollie has the ability to jump, kick, and roll, the latter two of which can be used to attack most hostile enemies. Nuts are scattered throughout the level which, upon being opened, have power-ups, keys, clovers, buddy bugs, or enemies. Gates can only be opened when Rollie has the appropriate colored key. Ladybugs are trapped at several points of each level and can be freed by kicking their web cages. When Rollie reaches the level exit, a hollow log, the player&#x27;s score is tallied based on the number of ladybugs freed, the number of clovers found, and if all four pieces of the blue clover has been found. In Level 9, if all 4 gold clovers are found, they will be tallied in that level.

==Plot==
&quot;Bugdom&quot;″s story centers on the Bugdom, a kingdom inhabited by insects that appears as an outdoors bug environment. Originally, the kingdom was peacefully ruled by rollie pollies and ladybugs, but not long ago, the kingdom was overthrown by the tyrannical and pompous King Thorax, leader of an evil clan of fire ants, as well as their evil follower bugs recruited prior to the kingdom&#x27;s downfall. Thorax now rules the kingdom with an iron fist, and the ladybugs have been imprisoned in spider web cages scattered across the environment. The player assumes the role of Rollie McFly, who has survived the ambush of the kingdom by taking refuge in the lawn area. Rollie must travel to Thorax&#x27;s anthill on the distant reaches of the Bugdom, while freeing various trapped ladybugs along the way.

===Characters===
Many bugs are out to kill Rollie so he must survive and save the Bugdom. Some other bugs are friendly.
* Ladybugs - They once ruled the Bugdom with Rollie McFly until they were trapped in webs by the terrible minions of the anthill led by King Thorax. Rollie must rescue them by kicking the web trap, making the beautiful bugs fly to safety.
* Buddy bugs (bees) - These small striped bugs behind Rollie are like smart bombs that can immediately be shot on enemies, killing them. They come from nuts and are handy when Rollie is being attacked by multiple enemies.
* Termites - These are minor enemies that come from nuts.
* Slugs - These large fat creatures are invincible, so they must be avoided.
* Boxer mantis - These green mantises wear boxing gloves. Rollie must kick or roll into them quickly.
* Spear-throwing ants - These minions of King Thorax have ugly faces and spears. They must be attacked three times to defeat them. They also hate water. There is also a variety that throws rocks.
* Mosquitoes - These female flies attack Rollie from above and drain both his life and rolling energy, swelling their heads. Rollie must attack them when their noses are impaled in the ground.
* Water hoppers - They can only be defeated by buddy bugs and should be avoided at all costs.
* Water spider - He is an aquatic taxi. If Rollie gives him a coin, the water spider will offer him a ride, making Rollie avoid the killer fish and frogs.
* Killer fish - These fish eat Rollie, resulting in an instant kill. They can be avoided by riding the water spider.
* Human feet - These pounding feet do big damage to Rollie, even if he runs into them from the side. They are all left feet.
* Spiders - These eight-legged monsters drop down in front of Rollie. They attack by shooting webs and then bounce on top of Rollie when he is trapped. They have made webs that King Thorax&#x27;s fire ants have trapped ladybugs in.
* Dragonflies - These green insects will offer Rollie a flight and can shoot fireballs (a spoof on actual dragons).
* Bats - These mammals are a danger of riding the dragonfly. If Rollie flies over the wooden fence, a bat will eat him, resulting in an instant kill.
* Caterpillars - These spiky creatures are similar to slugs, albeit bigger.
* Bees - These striped monsters follow Rollie wherever he goes. They die upon stinging him. They can be painlessly dispatched by rolling into them.
* Bee grubs - These small white grubs with bee faces can be killed either by being kicked or being jumped on.
* Drone bees - These muscular bees can fire their stingers but they die if they fire them. If Rollie is on the ball, they will try to pound their fists instead.
* Queen bee - This giant bee can spew blobs of honey which generate many bees. When fighting her, the shadows must be avoided as they have spikes. Rollie must roll into her face to defeat her. Buddy bugs can be shot at this female giant.
* Fire ants - These elite soldiers of King thorax can fly and shoot fire. They can be defeated by using a buddy bug.
* Fireflies - If Rollie is seen in their flashing glow, these annoying creatures can carry him off to somewhere that could kill him. They will explode if shot by a buddy bug.
* Toxic gas roaches - These cockroaches have green gas masks that protect them from the toxic slime. The gas they leave behind explodes if ignited by fire ants or buddy bugs, so they may die without Rollie having to fight them.
* Ghost ants - If a spear-throwing ant is killed, he will rise again as a ghost ant. He cannot be kicked but he will die if he is in lava or water. If Rollie hides for a while, he will dissipate.
* King Thorax - The game&#x27;s final boss. The king of the fire ants can shoot sparks from his staff and to defeat him, Rollie must kick the water pipes so they quench the fire on his head, then kick him. After he repeats this process, King Thorax will fall and the game will be completed.

==Reception==

Pangea Software considers &quot;Bugdom&quot; to be their most popular Mac game. The Mac OS version of &quot;Bugdom&quot; received generally positive reviews, according to a 70% on GameRankings. Dziga Robilev of IGN rated &quot;Bugdom&quot; a 7/10, calling it &quot;one of the best crafted platform games available for the Mac.&quot; However, Robilev also stated &quot;The only thing holding this baby back is that the levels themselves don&#x27;t offer enough variety. There is a lot of the same activity being performed over and over again. Still, the game is a fun play and younger gamers will definitely have a good time with it.&quot; &quot;MacMagazin&quot; rated the game a 6/6 Mac score, saying &quot;We are sure: &quot;Bugdom&quot; will be the summer hit this year among the Mac games.&quot; iMacSidian rated the game a 5/5, saying &quot;&quot;Bugdom&quot; really fills the huge gap of platform games for the Mac... The graphics are absolutely top notch - you have to see it to believe it.&quot; Mac Gamer&#x27;s Ledge rated the game a 4.5 out of 5 score, calling it &quot;a feast for the eyes and ears.&quot; AppleLinks called the game&#x27;s musical score &quot;fantastic&quot; and called the game &quot;one of the first games that really can be enjoyed by both children and adults.&quot; Inside Mac Games rated the game a 4/5, saying &quot;&quot;Bugdom&quot; is certainly a great game... and it is good enough to rival many of the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation titles that it is similar to. Its easy-to-grasp controls and interface are almost totally transparent, even to new users, and the feel of the game is just plush and polished - as is the look.

==Legacy==
A sequel to &quot;Bugdom&quot;, &quot;Bugdom 2&quot;, was released in 2002. It stars a grasshopper named Skip who attempts to retrieve his stolen knapsack from a large Bully Bee. As of March 1, 2002, it has sold over 30,000 copies worldwide, prompting Pangea to rerelease the game as a shareware release.

In December 2020, an open source version of &quot;Bugdom&quot; that uses OpenGL was released for modern systems (MacOS X, Linux, Windows) by Iliyas Jorio with the approval of PangeaSoft. In February 2021, Jorio also released a ported version of PangeaSoft&#x27;s game Nanosaur.

<doc id="653525" wikidata="Q1025416" url="?curid=653525" title="Caesar (video game)">
<text>Caesar is a 1992 city-building video game published by Sierra On-Line in which the player undertakes the role of a Roman governor, building ancient Roman cities.

Released in 1992 on the Amiga and ported the following year to Atari ST, PC and Macintosh, the game is similar to &quot;SimCity&quot;. In addition to similar graphics and user interfaces, it also came with issues of micromanagement, including complicated city-planning requirements such as building the right number of schools, theaters, libraries, bathhouses, and other amenities within suitable distances of residential areas.

An updated version, &quot;Caesar Deluxe&quot;, was released in 1993 for the Amiga. &quot;Caesar&quot; spawned three direct sequels and several spin-offs set in other ancient civilizations, which are together known as the &quot;City Building&quot; series.

==Reception==
According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Caesar II&quot; surpassed 400,000 units by the end of March 1996.

In June 1993, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; recommended &quot;Caesar&quot; to &quot;SimCity&quot; fans who &quot;wished for more buttons to push, knobs to adjust and wires to reroute&quot;. The magazine concluded that &quot;&quot;Caesar&quot; provides that rare quality in strategy gaming — an experience whose rewards prove equal to its challenges ... [it] provides the serious player with a real lion&#x27;s feast&quot;. A survey of pre-20th-century strategy games in the issue gave the game three-plus stars out of five, calling it &quot;More of a game than a simulation, but it can be fun&quot;.

&quot;Caesar&quot; and its sequel were named, collectively, the 96th best computer game ever by &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; in 1997. The editors wrote, &quot;Impressions keep on keeping on with the likes of &quot;Lords of the Realm&quot; [...] but have never managed to regain the dizzy peak they climbed with their handsome brace of think-&#x27;em-ups.&quot;

== Sequels ==
&quot;Caesar&quot; was developed and designed by Impressions Games and distributed by Sierra On-Line. Impressions also developed another Roman-themed game, &quot;Cohort 2&quot;, at the same time, which allowed players to direct ancient Roman battles in a style akin to a crude precursor of the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series. Impressions included a feature in &quot;Cohort 2&quot; which allowed players of &quot;Caesar&quot; to load their saved files and play out the battles from &quot;Caesar&quot; in &quot;Cohort 2&quot;. Later, Impressions released an updated version of &quot;Caesar&quot; which automatically launched a version of &quot;Cohort 2&quot; whenever the player engaged in battle. This version was released under the title &quot;Caesar Deluxe&quot; in 1994.

Impressions released the sequels &quot;Caesar II&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Caesar III&quot; in 1998. A third sequel, &quot;Caesar IV&quot;, was announced in August 2005 by Tilted Mill Entertainment and was subsequently released on September 26, 2006.

<doc id="653527" wikidata="Q6422917" url="?curid=653527" title="Knockout (1971 comic)">
<text>Knockout was a weekly British comics periodical published by Fleetway Publications from 12 June 1971 to 23 June 1973. A humour comic, the title ran until 1973 before being merged with another Fleetway title, &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot;.

==Stories==
Its strips included:

* &quot;Beat Your Neighbour&quot;: two families live next door to each other; although the introductory title picture shows them arguing, the two families often tried to be pleasant to one another while secretly trying to outdo each other. The results were quite often far-fetched but unexpected. One example was when one family said to the other that they should drink more milk for health reasons: the second family ordered more milk, the first family ordered even more, and eventually they were both ordering milk in churns, until the dairy brought the cows to their houses and told them to milk the cows themselves.
* &quot;Boney&quot;: Boney is a skeleton. The strip began with a boy called Billy, who went on an inane ghost train ride at a fair. The ride was so boring that one of the artifacts, Boney, decided to escape with Billy. The strip records the pair&#x27;s adventures as they try to stop the owner of the ghost train from recapturing Boney. &quot;Boney&quot; joined &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot; in 1973 after &quot;Knockout&quot; merged with it.
* &quot;Booter&quot;
* &quot;Dead Eye Dick&quot;
* &quot;Fuss Pot&quot;: about a teenage girl with a pointy nose of the same name, who fussed about everything and everyone in her path. At one stage the full title was: &quot;Fuss Pot, the Fussiest Girl of the Lot!&quot; Fuss Pot joined &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot; in 1973 after &quot;Knockout&quot; merged into that comic, and became a Chip-ite. She then joined &quot;Buster&quot; in 1990 after &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot;, in its turn, merged with that publication. Through the medium of reprints, the strip stayed with &quot;Buster&quot; until the end. The strip was mainly drawn by Norman Mansbridge. He was replaced in the 1990s by Trevor Metcalfe, whose strips introduced Fuss Pot&#x27;s cousin Scruff Pot. Artist Jack Edward Oliver included Fuss Pot on the last page of &quot;Buster&quot;″s final issue, revealing how all the characters in the comic came to an end. Fuss Pot&#x27;s excuse was that she was too fussy to appear in the comic.

<doc id="653532" wikidata="Q1964440" url="?curid=653532" title="Retracted article on dopaminergic neurotoxicity of MDMA">
<text>&quot;Severe dopaminergic neurotoxicity in primates after a common recreational dose regimen of MDMA(&quot;ecstasy&quot;)&quot;, is an article by George A. Ricaurte that was published in September 2002 in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Science&quot;, one of the world&#x27;s top academic journals. It was later retracted; instead of using MDMA, methamphetamine had been used in the test.

==Original publication==
An editorial article on the paper indicated that researchers had observed dopaminergic neurotoxicity (death of neurons involved in dopamine pathways) in monkeys following MDMA injections, a finding which suggested that recreational users of MDMA may be at risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders associated with dopamine dysfunction.

Following the release of the paper, &quot;Science&quot; published a “News of the week” article by Constance Holden. The article noted that the results of the study had caused the researchers concern that even a single night of MDMA usage could cause brain damage, and leave a person vulnerable to neurological disorders such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Holden also noted that the findings of the study were surprising, due to MDMA being known for prompting the release of large amounts of serotonin, but not dopamine. In the article, cognitive neuroscientist Jon Cole was described as being “skeptical” about the risk of Parkinson&#x27;s from MDMA use, stating that there had only been one case report of Parkinson&#x27;s related to the use of ecstasy. In response, the researchers stated that this could be due to symptoms not presenting until &quot;70% to 80%&quot; of dopamine had been depleted.

Alan Leshner, a former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also commented on the study, stating &quot;This says even a single evening&#x27;s use is playing Russian roulette with your own brain.&quot;

==Retraction==
In June 2003, a letter to &quot;Science&quot; was published in which the results of the study were questioned. Ricaurte stood by the findings.

In September 2003, the paper was retracted. In a statement published in ‘’Science’’, the research team indicated that due to a labelling error, methamphetamine had been administered to 9 of the 10 test animals instead of MDMA. The team had consistently been unable to replicate the original results, which lead to them conducting an investigation and ultimately discovering the error.

Following the retraction, Ricaurte stated that he would continue to investigate the possibility of a relationship between MDMA and dopamine dysfunction, and that the laboratory would be adjusting its chemical handling procedure.

==Reactions==
In a review of the year&#x27;s events published in the December issue of &quot;Science&quot;, Editor-in-Chief Donald Kennedy wrote, &quot;It was also a vintage year for scientific fluffs. We shared in one: Some vials containing the recreational drug Ecstasy got switched with vials containing methamphetamine, and we wound up publishing a paper we wish we hadn&#x27;t&quot;.

Journalists such as Larry Smith and Carla Spartos have stated that the inaccurate study may have influenced drug policy being made at the time, such as the RAVE act of April 2003.

In an interview in &quot;The Scientist&quot;, British scientists Colin Blakemore and Leslie Iversen described how they expressed concerns about the article with editors at Science. &quot;It&#x27;s an outrageous scandal,&quot; Iversen told The Scientist. &quot;It&#x27;s another example of a certain breed of scientist who appear to do research on illegal drugs mainly to show what the governments want them to show. They extract large amounts of grant money from the government to do this sort of biased work.&quot;

A study of the 50 largest American newspapers with available online archives found that 26 (52%) covered the original article&#x27;s publication, while 20 (40%) covered its retraction. Of the newspapers that covered the article&#x27;s publication, only 14 (54%) covered its retraction, suggesting large numbers of newspaper readers who had been exposed to the misinformation were never made aware that the study had been in error.

<doc id="653533" wikidata="Q268110" url="?curid=653533" title="Kay Francis">
<text>Kay Francis (born Katharine Edwina Gibbs; January 13, 1905 – August 26, 1968) was an American stage and film actress. After a brief period on Broadway in the late 1920s, she moved to film and achieved her greatest success between 1930 and 1936, when she was the number one female star and highest-paid actress at Warner Bros. studio. She adopted her mother&#x27;s maiden name (Francis) as her professional surname.

== Early life ==
Katharine Edwina Gibbs was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Territory (present-day Oklahoma), in 1905, the only child of Joseph Sprague Gibbs and Katharine Clinton ( Francis), an actress. Wed in 1903, her parents divorced in 1909 when Kay&#x27;s mother left her alcoholic father and took Kay with her.

Her mother had been born in Nova Scotia, Canada, and was a successful actress and singer on a hardscrabble theatrical circuit under the stage name Katharine Clinton. Kay often traveled with her mother. Kay attended Catholic schools when it was affordable, becoming a student at the Institute of the Holy Angels at age five. After also attending Miss Fuller&#x27;s School for Young Ladies in Ossining, New York (1919) and the Cathedral School (1920), she enrolled at the Katharine Gibbs Secretarial School in New York City. While there she did nothing to discourage the assumption that her mother was Katharine Gibbs, the pioneering American businesswoman who had established the Gibbs chain of vocational schools.

In 1922, 17-year-old Kay was engaged to James Dwight Francis, a well-to-do man from Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Their marriage, at New York&#x27;s Saint Thomas Church, ended in divorce three years later.

== Stage career ==
In the spring of 1925, Francis went to Paris to get a divorce. While there, she was courted by Bill Gaston, a former athlete at Harvard and member of the Boston Bar Association. Secretly married in October 1925, their marriage was short-lived, with only occasional visits between Bill in Boston and Kay in New York City following her mother&#x27;s footsteps onto the stage.

She made her Broadway debut as the Player Queen in a modern-dress version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; in November 1925. She often &quot;borrowed&quot; wardrobe for fashionable nights out in New York that were reported on by the day&#x27;s press. Francis claimed she got the part by &quot;lying a lot, to the right people&quot;. One of them was producer Stuart Walker, who hired her to join his Portmanteau Theatre Company. She soon found herself commuting between Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Indiana. She played wisecracking secretaries, saucy French floozies, walk-ons, bit parts, and heavies.

By February 1927, Francis returned to New York and got a part in the Broadway play &quot;Crime&quot;. A teenage Sylvia Sidney had its lead, but later said that Francis stole the show.

After Francis&#x27;s divorce from Gaston in September 1927, she became engaged to society playboy Alan Ryan Jr. She promised his family that she would not return to the stage – a vow that lasted only a few months before she was playing an aviator in a Rachel Crothers play, &quot;Venus&quot;.

Francis appeared in only one other Broadway production, titled &quot;Elmer the Great&quot; in 1928. Written by Ring Lardner, produced by George M. Cohan, and starring Walter Huston, the play nonetheless flopped. Though flat broke at the time, Francis was unwilling to ask friends for help and determined to &quot;crawl out of this mess herself.&quot;

Huston had been impressed by Francis&#x27;s performance and encouraged her to take a screen test for his new studio, Paramount Pictures, and the film &quot;Gentlemen of the Press&quot; (1929). Paramount offered her a starting contract of $300 per week for five weeks. Francis made &quot;Press&quot; and the Marx Brothers film &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; (1929) at Paramount&#x27;s Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens, New York before moving to Hollywood.

== Film career ==
Major film studios, which had formerly been based in New York, had relocated successfully to California. With the coming of sound pictures, even more Broadway actors were enticed to Hollywood, including Ann Harding, Aline MacMahon, Helen Twelvetrees, Spencer Tracy, Paul Muni, Barbara Stanwyck, Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Joan Blondell and Leslie Howard.

Signed to a featured players contract with Paramount Pictures, Francis also made the move and created an immediate impression. She frequently co-starred with William Powell, first teaming in &quot;Street of Chance&quot; (1930) when David Selznick fought for the pairing after having seen Francis briefly in &quot;Behind the Make-up&quot; (1930). It worked, and they appeared in as many as six to eight movies together per year, making a total of 21 films between 1930 and 1932.

Francis&#x27;s career flourished at Paramount in spite of a slight, but distinctive rhotacism (she pronounced the letter &quot;r&quot; as &quot;w&quot;) that gave rise to the nickname &quot;Wavishing Kay Fwancis&quot;. She appeared in George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;thrillingly amoral comedy&quot; &quot;Girls About Town&quot; (1931) and &quot;24 Hours&quot; (1931). On December 16, 1931, Francis and her co-stars opened the newly constructed art deco Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California, with a gala preview screening of &quot;The False Madonna&quot;.

In 1932, Francis&#x27;s career at Paramount changed gears when Warner Bros. promised her star status at a better salary of $4,000 a week. Paramount sued Warner Bros. over the loss. Warner Bros. persuaded both Francis and Powell to join the ranks of their stars, along with Ruth Chatterton. After her first three featured roles had been as a villainess, Francis was given roles with a more sympathetic screen persona, such as in &quot;The False Madonna&quot;, where she plays a jaded society woman who learns the importance of hearth and home when nursing a terminally ill child. After Francis&#x27;s career skyrocketed at Warner Bros., she was loaned back to Paramount for Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; (1932).

=== Mainstream successes ===
From 1932 through 1936, Francis was the queen of the Warner Bros. lot, and, increasingly, her films were developed as star vehicles. By 1935, Francis was one of the highest-paid actors, earning a yearly salary of $115,000, dwarfing the $18,000 Bette Davis – who would one day occupy Francis&#x27;s dressing room – made. From 1930 to 1937, Francis appeared on the covers of 38 film magazines, second only to child sensation Shirley Temple&#x27;s 138.

Soon after her arrival in Hollywood, she began an affair with actor and producer Kenneth MacKenna, whom she married in January 1931. MacKenna&#x27;s Hollywood career foundered, having spent more time in New York with the couple&#x27;s amicable 1933 separation; they divorced in 1934.

Francis frequently played long-suffering heroines, in films such as &quot;I Found Stella Parish&quot;, &quot;Secrets of an Actress&quot;, and &quot;Comet Over Broadway&quot;, displaying to good advantage lavish wardrobes that, in some cases, were more memorable than the characters she played – a fact often emphasized by contemporary film reviewers. As Belinda in &quot;Give Me Your Heart&quot; (1936) with co-stars George Brent and Roland Young, her performance had &quot;reticence and pathos&quot; and garnered welcoming reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In October 1937, Francis met aviation businessman Raven Freiherr von Barnekow at a party of Countess Dorothy Dentice di Frasso&#x27;s in Beverly Hills. In March 1938, Louella Parsons reported on their intended marriage and that Francis would retire from films, but by October the two were traveling separately and Francis was still acting; by December, Barnekow had returned to Germany.

Francis&#x27;s clothes horse reputation and statuesque frame often led Warners&#x27; producers to concentrate resources on lavish sets and costumes rather than the quality of the storylines, a move designed to appeal to Depression-era female audiences and capitalize on her reputation as the epitome of chic. Eventually, Francis herself became dissatisfied with these vehicles and began openly to feud with Warner Bros., even threatening a lawsuit against them for inferior scripts and treatment. This, in turn, led to her demotion to programmers, such as &quot;Women in the Wind&quot; (1939), and, in the same year, to the termination of her contract.

=== &quot;Box Office Poison&quot; and revival ===
The Independent Theatre Owners Association paid for an advertisement in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in May 1938 that included Francis, along with Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Fred Astaire, Mae West, Katharine Hepburn and others, on a list of stars dubbed &quot;box office poison&quot;. After her release from Warner Bros., she was unable to secure another studio contract. Carole Lombard, who had been a supporting player in Francis&#x27;s 1931 film &quot;Ladies&#x27; Man,&quot; insisted Francis be cast in her film &quot;In Name Only&quot; (1939). Francis had a supporting role to Lombard and Cary Grant, and it offered her an opportunity to engage in some serious acting. After this, she moved to supporting parts in other films, playing fast-talking, professional women – holding her own against Rosalind Russell in &quot;The Feminine Touch&quot;, for example – and mothers opposite rising young stars such as Deanna Durbin.

Francis had one lead role at the end of the decade opposite Humphrey Bogart in the gangster film &quot;King of the Underworld,&quot; released in 1939. The movie was a remake of Paul Muni&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Socrates&quot; (1935), with Francis in the role of a doctor who is forced to treat Bogart&#x27;s injured gangster character and then gets caught up with the law. Originally titled &quot;Lady Doctor,&quot; the film was shelved, then retitled &quot;Unlawful&quot; for reshoots to beef up Bogart&#x27;s role. By the film&#x27;s release, Warner Bros. had again changed titles to &quot;King of the Underworld&quot; while demoting Francis to second billing.

=== World War II era ===
With the start of World War II, Francis joined the war effort, doing volunteer work with the Naval Aid Auxiliary, where she was named head of the NAA&#x27;s Hospital Unit. She also performed extensive war-zone touring, first chronicled in the book &quot;Four Jills in a Jeep&quot;, written by fellow volunteer Carole Landis. It became a popular 1944 film, &quot;Four Jills in a Jeep&quot;, with a cavalcade of stars and Martha Raye and Mitzi Mayfair joining Landis and Francis to fill out the complement of Jills.

At the end of the war, &quot;Four Jills&quot; was given a four-star production by 20th Century Fox, but still needed distribution through Monogram, and the decade found Francis virtually unemployable in Hollywood. She signed a three-film contract with Poverty Row studio Monogram Pictures that gave her production credit as well as star billing. The resulting films &quot;Divorce&quot;, &quot;Wife Wanted&quot; and &quot;Allotment Wives&quot; had limited releases in 1945 and 1946.

Francis spent the remainder of the 1940s on the stage, appearing with some success in &quot;State of the Union&quot; and touring in various productions of plays, old and new, including &quot;Windy Hill&quot;, backed by former Warner Bros. colleague Ruth Chatterton. Declining health, aggravated by an accident in Columbus, Ohio during a tour of &quot;State of the Union&quot; in 1948, when she was badly burned by a radiator after passing out from an accidental overdose from pills, hastened her retirement from show business. This incident was first reported as a fainting spell brought on by the pills, with a complication of respiratory infection. Her manager and traveling companion had arrived at Francis&#x27;s hotel room and, in an attempt to revive the unconscious actress with fresh air, burned her legs on the radiator near the window. She recovered in an oxygen tent at the local hospital; soon retiring from acting and then, public life.

== Personal life ==
Francis married three times, to James Dwight Francis (1922–1925); William Gaston (1925–1927); and Kenneth MacKenna (1931–1934). It was erroneously reported by Walter Winchell that her third had been to screenwriter John Meehan around 1929. She had affairs with Maurice Chevalier and Raven Freiherr von Barnekow.

Her diaries, which are preserved along with her film-related material in an academic collection at Wesleyan University open to scholars and researchers, paint a picture of a woman whose personal life was often in disarray. She regularly socialized with gay men, one of whom, Anderson Lawler, was reportedly paid $10,000 by Warner Bros. to accompany her to Europe in 1934.

In 1966, Francis was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy, but the cancer had already spread. She died in 1968, aged 63. Anxious to be forgotten, she wanted neither services nor grave marker. Her body was immediately cremated, and according to her will her ashes were to be disposed of &quot;how the undertaker sees fit.&quot;

Having no living immediate family members, Francis left more than $1 million to The Seeing Eye, an organization in New Jersey, which trains guide dogs for the blind.

<doc id="653537" wikidata="Q191204" url="?curid=653537" title="Sulaymaniyah">
<text>Sulaymaniyah or Slemani (; ), is a city in the east of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and is the capital of the Sulaymaniyah Governorate. It is surrounded by the Azmar (Ezmer), Goizha (Goyje) and Qaiwan (Qeywan) Mountains in the northeast, Baranan Mountain in the south and the Tasluja Hills in the west. The city has a semi-arid climate with very hot dry summers and cold wet winters.

The modern city of Slemani was founded in 1784 by the Ottoman-Kurdish prince Ibrahim Pasha Baban in Collaboration with Azim Beg and Haji Aziz Bey Aghall Dwanze Swarey Meriwane Jawamer Agha Rangena, who named it after his father Sulayman Pasha. Slemani was the capital of the historic Kurdish principality of Baban from 1784 to 1850.

==History==

The region of Slemani was known as &quot;Zamwa&quot; prior to the foundation of the modern city in 1784. The capital of the Kurdish Baban principality (1649–1850), before Slemani, was a territory named &quot;Qelaçiwalan&quot;. At the time of the Babani&#x27;s rule there were major conflicts between the Safavid dynasty and the Ottoman Empire. Qelaçiwalan became a battleground for the two rivals.

In 1783, Ibrahim Baban became ruler of the emirate and began the reconstruction of a city which once constructed by Ottoman Sultan Sulayman (the name of Sulaymaniyah came from his name) new city which would become its capital. In 1784 he finished erecting a number of palaces for trade called &quot;Qeyserîs&quot; and bazaars, which were also used as baths, and began inviting people from the surrounding villages and emirates to move to the newly established city. Soon Melkendî, which was originally intended to be the city itself, instead became one of its quarters. The new city of Slemani was named after Sulayman Baba, who was the first Baban prince to gain control of the province of Şarezûr. Sulayman Baban invaded the neighboring Kurdish vassaldom of Ardalan, defeating their forces in 1694. Ottoman Sultan Mustafa II assigned him the district of Baban. 

Haji Aziz Bey Aghall Dwanze Swarey Meriwane Jawamer Agha Rangena is not to be confused with the royal and aristocratic Jwamer Agha, although they possess family ties through marriage. He was the Billionaire Bey of the noble and aristocratic Kurdish Noori-Aghall family, who founded the city in collaboration with Ibrahim Pasha Baban and Azim Beg. Ibrahim Pasha Baban invited Haji to build Slemani. They founded the city of Sarkarez together. He was the first individual to establish a cemetery in Slemani, utilising his land, which had initially been designated for sumac cultivation. Aghall asserted that he had no intention of generating profit, citing his personal wealth as sufficient to assist the impoverished. He further demonstrated his altruistic nature by opening the doors of his palace, allowing the indigent to take whatever they required. He provided them with nuts, chicken, rice and food items that were typically consumed by the aristocracy during his era. Additionally, he constructed the inaugural bridge in Slemani, testing its stability by riding his horse across it. He expressed a sense of indifference to his own safety, stating that if he were to perish due to the bridge&#x27;s collapse, it would serve as a testament to its inadequacy and raise awareness among the citizens. He also created the first mosque in Slemani, which is currently in poor condition but has &#x27;Aghall&#x27; written on the walls. Following his demise, his family encountered criticism, which prompted them to sell the mansion and convert it into a car park. Many older Kurds who had known him expressed disapproval of this decision. Regardless of his death, he is a highly respected nobleman. Many peasants offered their religion for his actions, but he refused, saying that he does not need any recognition and that he is happy with everything he has. He was offered royal titles, but he refused. His wife, the noblewoman Fatima Khanum, sold all her gold to support her husband in saving hundreds of thousands of peasants with his wealth during the First World War. For their actions, they are buried in a sacred private grave on the sumac farm.

According to Jewish tradition, Sulaiman Baban emphasized the importance of a town having Jewish residents for its completeness. A mission was then sent to Qaradagh, a town with a thriving Jewish community, and surrounding villages. The Jews of Qaradagh responded by sending the first group of Jewish inhabitants to Sulaymaniyah.

In the early 1800s refugees from Ardalan moved to Slemani, including Mastura Ardalan, the widow of Xosraw Xanî Erdalan, the ruler of the kingdom. Erdalan wrote an account of Kurdish history in Persian and was buried in Slemani when he died in 1848.

From 1922 to 1924, Slemani was the capital of the Kingdom of Kurdistan, a short-lived unrecognized state declared by Iraqi Kurds following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
==Demographics==
In 1820, only 36 years after the creation of the city, a British man named Rech visited the city and estimated that its population was more than ten thousand, containing 2,144 families of which 2,000 were Muslim, 130 Jewish, and 14 Christian.

Ottoman documents from 1907 suggest that there were 8,702 Muslim and 360 non-Muslim residents living in the city at that time. The &quot;Peshkawtin&quot; newspaper which was distributed in Slemani in 1920 estimated its population to be around ten thousand.

The early 1920s Iraqi Revolt against the British rule of the Mandate for Mesopotamia led by Shaikh Mahmud triggered a wave of Jewish emigration from Sulaymaniyah.

According to Iraqi government documents, by 1947 the number of residents had increased to 23,475. In the same year, records documented the existence of three hundred Jewish families, comprising a total of 1,517 individuals. Notably, nearly the entire Jewish community, except one family, made aliyah to the emerging State of Israel in 1951–52.

By 1998, the local population was estimated at 548,747, which grew in 2015 to an estimated 656,100.

The American University of Iraq, Sulaimani estimated the number of inhabitants in 2016 at 800,000.

== Geography and climate ==

The city is located in northern Iraq and Southern Kurdistan. Of the main population centres in the country, it is characterized by its cooler summer temperatures and its rainier winters. Average temperatures range from . In the winters, there can be a significant amount of snow. Snow falls every year or two.

The Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa).

== Education ==
The University of Slemani was opened in 1968 with instruction in Kurdish, Arabic, and English. It has faculties in engineering, agriculture, the arts, science, and medicine. It is the largest university in the Kurdistan Region. A second university, Sulaimani Polytechnic University was established in 2012, also teaching in Kurdish, English and Arabic.

In 2007 The American University of Iraq – Sulaimani, (AUI-S) was a new addition to the American universities in the Middle East, graduating its fifth class in 2016. Instruction at this private, not-for-profit liberal arts university is in English only, featuring a US-accredited program in English as a Second Language (ESL). There are a number of other private universities.

==Culture==

Two independent newspapers &quot;Hawlati&quot; and &quot;Awena&quot; and two independent political magazines &quot;Lvin&quot; and &quot;Shock&quot;, are published and distributed in Slemani city. Since 2016, there exists an International Film Festival in the city which is organized by the College of Fine Arts of the University of Sulaymanya.

Slemani is the only city in South Kurdistan that regularly celebrates World Music Day or Fête de la Musique. In one trip to the city, a journalist working for the BBC wrote about Slemani&#x27;s distinct culture:&quot;Culture is hugely important to the Kurdish people, especially in Slemani, but there is a strong pull to the west—modernisation and consumerism—driven perhaps by the satellite televisions they have had access to since they started running their own affairs...And at the university, students mill around the campus, chattering with each other and doing some last-minute cramming for their exams. The war only stopped lectures for a few weeks. There are probably more women than men and they are happy to air their views to anyone who asks.&quot;

Slemani was the home of poets such as Nalî, Mahwi, and Piramerd.

== Economy ==
Since 2003, Slemani has experienced a growing local economy. Its economy today relies on tourism, agriculture and a number of small factories, most of which are involved in the building trade.

In 2004 the Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis in Iraq released an in-depth survey of the Slemani Governorate in which they surveyed each city. In this survey, one can see the economic boom of 2003 mentioned earlier.

===Tourism===

The city was visited by more than 60,000 tourists in 2009.
Slemani attracted more than 15,000 Iranian tourists in the first quarter of 2010, many drawn by the fact it is not subject to strict laws faced at home. Newroz 2010 drew an exodus of Iranian tourists choosing to celebrate the event in the region.

Born in Helsinki, Rung is Jewish, and she is of Russian descent through her mother, Rosa Manulkin, and of Polish descent through her father, Oscar Rung. She started her career in 1961, when she placed second in a Finnish song contest. The success gave her a chance to record her first single &quot;Brigitte Bardot&quot;. Her most famous schlagers include &quot;Tipi-tii&quot;, &quot;El Bimbo&quot; and &quot;Eviva Espanja.&quot; In the 1970s, she also became well known in Germany.

<doc id="653542" wikidata="Q652491" url="?curid=653542" title="Orenstein &amp; Koppel">
<text>Orenstein &amp; Koppel (normally abbreviated to &quot;O&amp;K&quot;) was a major German engineering company specialising in railway vehicles, escalators, and heavy equipment. It was founded on April 1, 1876, in Berlin by Benno Orenstein and Arthur Koppel.

Originally a general engineering company, O&amp;K soon started to specialise in the manufacture of railway vehicles. The company also manufactured heavy equipment and escalators. O&amp;K pulled out of the railway business in 1981. Its escalator-manufacturing division was spun off to the company&#x27;s majority shareholder at the time, Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp, in 1996, leaving the company to focus primarily on construction machines. The construction-equipment business was sold to New Holland Construction, at the time part of the Fiat Group, in 1999.

==Founding and railway work==
The Orenstein &amp; Koppel Company was a mechanical-engineering firm that first entered the railway-construction field, building locomotives and other railroad cars.

First founded in 1892 in Schlachtensee, in the Zehlendorf district of Berlin, and known as the Märkische Lokomotivfabrik, the O&amp;K factories expanded to supply the Imperial German Army under Kaiser Wilhelm II with field-service locomotives, or &quot;Feldbahn&quot;. O&amp;K supplied all manner of railway equipment to the Army. Because of strained capacity at the Schlachtensee shops, work transferred in 1899 to a site in Nowawes, later Babelsberg, near Potsdam. Around 1908, O&amp;K acquired the firm of Gerlach and König in Nordhausen, building petrol and diesel locomotives there under the trade mark &quot;Montania&quot;.

==Diversification==
O&amp;K expanded to build freight and passenger cars, and above all, excavators for construction. The company also built other heavy equipment, including graders, dump trucks, forklift trucks, compressors, crawler loaders, wheeled loaders, road rollers, and truck cranes.

The company also began manufacturing escalators, transmissions, rapid-transit railway lines, buses, tractors, and cargo ships. Passenger liners, shipboard cranes, and shipbuilding enterprises rounded out the company&#x27;s profile. Because of the company&#x27;s thriving export business, a worldwide system of branch offices was created.

In the early years of the 20th century, O&amp;K built bucket chain trenchers, at first from wood, and—after 1904—completely from steel. These were propelled by steam or oil engines. O&amp;K also made railway trenchers for work in heavy soils.

In the First World War, O&amp;K built railway engines and cars of all sizes for the German government. With the collapse of Imperial Germany in November 1918, the victorious Allies put further restrictions on German manufacturing and military capacity, seizing all army &quot;Feldbahn&quot; engines as per the terms of the Versailles Treaty that ended the First World War. The treaty also removed access to export markets; at the end of 1925, work stopped for three months as a result of the lost business. By 1935, business had recovered and the company produced 5,299 locomotives. After the war, O&amp;K&#x27;s American subsidiary, the Orenstein-Arthur Koppel Company, was seized by the Alien Property Custodian and sold at an auction where only United States citizens were allowed to place bids.

Besides the &quot;Feldbahn&quot; contracts, the company produced Series 50 steam locomotives and standard gauge vehicles in the 1930s. They also delivered some broad gauge CSÉT shunting locomotives with a gauge of to the Irish Sugar Company (Comlucht Siúcre Éireann) in Ireland (2 of which have been preserved). The company produced diesel locomotives, and Series 44 and Series 50 steam engines, for the national railway company, Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft.

In 1922, they manufactured their first continuous-track steam shovel. In 1926, diesel engines replaced steam engines; the company converted earlier steam units to diesel power as the need arose. O&amp;K merged with a kerosene-engine builder, selling the engines under the O&amp;K banner.

==Nazi era and the Second World War==
At the Spandau factory, O&amp;K built cable-operated excavators and bucket-wheel excavators for use in the lignite coal mines of eastern Germany. Under the Aryanisation scheme of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Germany, the Orenstein family&#x27;s shares in the company were forcibly sold in 1935; Orenstein and Koppel was placed under trust administration, and the Babelsberger works were taken over and renamed in 1941. O&amp;K existed in name only, but more commonly used the abbreviation MBA (Maschienenbau und Bahnbedarf AG).

After heavy bomb attacks on Berlin caused a fire in the company&#x27;s plant-administration buildings, factory production minister Albert Speer redistributed work and factories around the country to lessen the risk from a single attack. For the remainder of World War II, no more locomotives were built in Berlin. Four hundred and twenty-one locomotives already under construction were shifted to Prague to protect the existing factories. During the war, O&amp;K provided 400 Class 52 locomotives.

==East Germany==

After the end of the war, the locomotive plant in Nordhausen went idle. Under the German Democratic Republic, O&amp;K changed its name to the VEB Company, and resumed heavy mechanical manufacturing at Nordhausen, producing cable-operated excavator shovels, among other things.

By 1946, the Babelsberg factory resumed production of locomotive boilers, and one year later the plant delivered its first postwar locomotive.
The German Democratic Republic nationalised the railroads and rolling stock manufacturers. The O&amp;K plants in Babelsberg were renamed the LOWA Lokomotiv Plant Karl Marx (LKM). The LKM became the sole manufacturer of diesel locomotives for the GDR, such as the large DRG V180. In the late 1950s, the plant developed steam and diesel engines for the Deutsche Reichsbahn narrow-gauge railways, building approximately 4,160 engines. The LKM also produced locomotives for foreign orders. The Indonesian State Railways ordered 20 units of C300 class diesel shunters in 1966 and were delivered in 1967.

Construction of steam locomotives ended in 1969, leaving diesel-hydraulic locomotives as the company&#x27;s priority. The company&#x27;s last diesel locomotive was the DB Class V 60D, manufactured until 1976.
Over the course of 30 years as LKM, the company produced approximately 7,760 locomotives; about a third of that number were manufactured for export.

By 1964, the company had expanded into air-conditioning and refrigeration technology.

==West Germany==
In West Germany, the enterprise resumed operation after World War II in 1949, under the name Orenstein &amp; Koppel AG, with headquarters in Berlin. In 1950, it incorporated under that name after merging with the Lübecker Crane Company. After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the head office moved to Dortmund.

By the mid-1970s, the enterprise had grown steadily. In 1972, O&amp;K had five working plants: West Berlin, Dortmund, Hagen, Hattingen/Ruhr, and Lübeck; it maintained a central spare-parts service in Bochum. That year, the company had 8,530 employees. The company had 24 business and sales offices in West Germany, and agencies on all five populated continents.

The West German company emphasised the manufacture of railroad cars and construction equipment, particularly excavators. In 1961, O&amp;K manufactured Europe&#x27;s first series of fully hydraulic excavators. They manufactured over 55,000 hydraulic excavators; more than 700 of those were rated at over 100 tons&#x27; service weight. O&amp;K also manufactured the world&#x27;s largest hydraulic excavator, at 900 tons&#x27; service weight with a shovel capacity of over and an engine output of 2,984 kilowatts (4,055 HP).

The company also diversified into escalator manufacturing.

==Decline==
After 1964, the railway-manufacturing unit was separated from the other production units.

The railway business was transferred to Bombardier, which continued to manufacture rolling stock in Berlin. The Babelsberg site became an industrial park.

The escalator-manufacturing division was sold to the company&#x27;s majority shareholder at the time, Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp, in 1996.

The mining-equipment business was sold to Terex in 1997 and went over Bucyrus to Caterpillar Inc.

The construction-equipment business was sold to New Holland Construction, at the time part of the Fiat Group, in 1999.

== Steam locomotives ==
=== Tank locomotives with two coupled axles (Type 0-4-0) ===

Based on O&amp;K&#x27;s experience, they have created a number of type 0-4-0 standard designs, which have proven to be particularly suitable for many companies. Locomotives of these standard designs were always under construction, and locomotives of the most common strengths were always in stock, so that they could be dispatched immediately on request. Two-axle locomotives were mainly used by construction companies and industrial establishments; accordingly, special emphasis was placed on simple and practical construction. In particular, the locomotives were characterised by high tractive power, while the smaller types were generally based on a lower speed in favour of tractive power.

The standard-gauge locomotives in this category were particularly suitable for shunting and for operating purposes on branch lines.

For light railways, especially for narrow-gauge railways, with steep gradients, tight curves and generally a light superstructure and substructure, locomotives with only two axles did often not meet the requirements in terms of tractive force and caused wear of the track and the wheel tyres due to their wheel load. Therefore, larger locomotives with more axles were available, as shown below.

=== Tank locomotives with three coupled axles (Type 0-6-0) ===

As with the two-axle coupled locomotives, the full weight of the machines with three coupled axles was used as adhesion weight. However, since the wheel pressure was distributed over six wheels instead of four, locomotives of this category could run on much lighter rails than two-axle locomotives with the same weight and therefore the same tractive force. This type of locomotive could therefore be used wherever the existing track required the most powerful locomotive possible without exceeding the permissible wheel pressure, or where the superstructure was to be constructed relatively lightly. Particularly on longer lines, the latter was considered for the sake of substantial savings. However, the track curves must be larger when using this locomotive than with the four-wheelers.

=== Locomotives with two coupled axles and one svivelling axle (Types 2-4-0 or 0-4-2) ===

If the locomotive had to travel through small curves with a light superstructure, it was advisable to purchase a locomotive with two axles and a svivelling axle. This type was especially suitable for longer distances because, it allowed a light superstructure and was also able, to carry larger supplies than 0-4-0 locomotives with the same wheel pressure. The design also had the advantage that the centre of gravity could be set lower than on other types. This, together with the large wheelbase, gave the machines a particularly smooth ride. It could also run at a relatively higher speed, so that, according to the above, it was mainly suitable for small railways and feeder lines. Depending on the particular conditions, O&amp;K installed the svivelling axle at the rear or at the front, but always in such a way that the greatest possible adhesive weight was maintained. Since the full weight of this type of machine could never be used as the adhesive weight, this construction was less suitable for carrying large loads. For such cases OK recommended the use of multi-axle coupled locomotives of the Gölsdorf type or, if small curves were available, to the locomotives of the Mallet or Klien-Lindner type, as shown below.

=== Coupled compound locomotives (Type 0-4-4-0, Mallet design) ===

In many cases, where 0-4-0 or 0-6-0 steam locomotives were no longer sufficient, O&amp;K built 0-4-4-0 or 0-6-6-0 compound locomotives, Mallet design, which supplemented the more conventional looking 0-4-2 locomotives (in Germany categorized as 2×2/2 and 2x3/3 double compound locomotives in comparison to the more conventional looking 2/3 locomotives). Apart from the possibility of being used on light superstructures and small curves, the locomotive had the advantage of great tractive power due to the composite arrangement of the cylinders, as the full weight was used as adhesion weight. The design was such that the boiler, driver&#x27;s cab and storage boxes were connected to the rear frame, which carried the high-pressure cylinders, while the front frame, on which the low-pressure cylinders were located, was connected to the rear frame by two vertical hinges. The boiler with the water boxes rested on a slide track of the front frame, so that the latter could move freely under the boiler. The steam passed from the regulator in fixed pipes to the high-pressure cylinders and, after expansion in these, through an absolutely steam-tight, flexible, well-insulated pipe to the low-pressure cylinders. The exhaust steam entered the exhauster through a vertical movable pipe. A special valve made it possible to feed boiler steam directly to the low-pressure cylinders, so that all four cylinders came into operation immediately when the locomotive was started-up.

=== Locomotives with coupled hollow axles with radial and lateral movement (Klien-Lindner design) ===

For railways with steep gradients and relatively light track construction, locomotives with two or three coupled axles often did not meet the requirements of increased traffic. Due to the high costs involved, the existing tracks could often not be converted, and heavier locomotives with a larger number of axles were used. Where small curvatures precluded the use of long, fixed wheelbases, locomotives with steerable bogies or, for the sake of simplicity, locomotives with curvilinear coupled axles were often used. The acquisition of such locomotives was also advisable for such new designs where the track systems and bridges were easier and cheaper to build. Since 1901, locomotives with coupled hollow axles have been built in particular according to the Klien-Lindner design, which has proved extremely successful in operation. The advantages of this design were:

# Large tractive force at a given permissible wheel pressure
# Large wheelbase with the best curve mobility and equal spring loading on both sides of each end axle and thus safe running of the locomotive
# Shock-free running into curves, as well as safe return to the centre position when running on straight track
# Equally good running when driving forwards and backwards
# Low wear of the rails and wheel tyres
The arrangement and mode of operation was as follows: The laterally and radially movable coupled axle was installed as the end axle, and in the case of eight- or ten-wheelers, these steering axles arranged at both ends ensured that the locomotive could enter the curves without difficulty. All axles were coupled in the usual way by fixed rods and mounted in axle bushes &quot;bb&quot; outside the wheels, following the spring play. The axle bushes sit in a continuous, fixed frame on which the steam cylinders are arranged in the usual way. The steering axle consists of a core axle &quot;a&quot; fixed in &quot;bb&quot; and driven in the usual way, and a hollow axle &quot;c&quot; which is firmly connected to the wheels and can be moved laterally and radially and which encloses the core axle, which is provided with a ball attachment in the middle, by means of a two-part ball cup &quot;d&quot;.

The load on the axle was distributed by the ball pivot of the core axle &quot;a&quot; as it were by a transverse balancer on both wheels of the axle and thus equal wheel pressures and safety against derailment are obtained. The hollow axle is driven by a driving pin &quot;f&quot; pressed into the ball pivot of the core axle with sliding pieces at both ends, which have the necessary lateral play in the housing of the hollow axle for the deflection of the axle. In order to return the hollow axle to its central position after deflection, either return springs are arranged in the central housing, or, as can be seen in the following illustration, counter-guides &quot;g&quot; are arranged which, by means of brackets, enclose the hollow axles in the auxiliary bearing positions &quot;ee&quot; and effect unconstrained, shock-free adjustment of the hollow axle, since both end axles must execute their radial or lateral movement simultaneously. In order to counteract the unsteady running of the steering axles on the track and any lurching of the locomotive, these locomotives are fitted with an adjustable safety device which holds the drawbar frames in the central position on the track by means of spring tension; no pressure is exerted against the bearing points with this resetting device. These axles do not require any maintenance except for periodic lubrication. The periodic lubrication mentioned is only necessary at intervals of 1 to 2 months and is carried out after loosening the two lubricating screws &quot;s&quot; located on the centre of the axle by introducing grease or viscous oil into the sliding boxes of the driving pin. Only during a general inspection of the locomotives is it necessary to also inspect the hollow axles to make sure that the internal parts are in good condition.

O&amp;K have used the Klien-Lindner axles for the Royal Prussian State Railways and many other railway in large numbers. The administration of the military railway has also introduced 0-8-0 locomotives with steerable coupled axles in place of the 0-6-0 field railway locomotives previously built.

=== Locomotives with laterally movable coupled axles (Gölsdorf design) ===

Locomotives of the Gölsdorf design were only suitable for lines, on which there were relatively few and large curvatures. In this case it was sufficient to shift one or more coupling axles sideways in such a way that the movable axles were not guided in their axle bearings but by their own flanges. The bearings of the coupling rods have the same lateral play on their journals as the axles in the axle bearings. This type of construction has proven itself well on eight- and multi-wheel locomotives, but it was not suitable for very small curvatures. In terms of performance and even load distribution, etc., it was equivalent to the more common Klien-Lindner locomotives. They were used for main, branch and small railways.

Two of the five axles of a ten-wheel locomotive could move sideways relative to the frame because their axle boxes fixed them rigidly to the frame. The other axles, however, were fitted into their bearings and attached to their drives in such a way that they can be moved sideways during curve running, depending on the sideways forces acting on them. In addition the connecting and coupling rods, through which linear forces from the steam pistons were translated into the rotation of the wheels via the crank pins, also had to be able to move sideways.

=== Tramway locomotives (Type 0-4-0)===

O&amp;K built tramway locomotives, which were used for operation on tramways serving public traffic, either with a driver&#x27;s cab at the front and rear or with only one driver&#x27;s cab in the middle of the locomotive; furthermore with a power unit cover in two different designs. Whereas one version only served to conceal the engine from road traffic, the other version served to protect the engine parts against dust. The desired type of covering is to be specified. The weight of this locomotive was relatively high and therefore it could develop a great performance immediately when starting up, even on short gradients. This was effectively supported by a high steam overpressure, which O&amp;K usually provided for these locomotives with .

The fairing of all moving parts was intended to protect other road users such as pedestrians from serious injuries in case of accidents. It also prevented horses from shying and protected the transmission from dirt and dust on the unpaved roads that were common at the time. Often there was no stoker on tram locomotives, which meant they were operated by the driver in one-man operation. The short axle stands also ensured that narrow curves could be negotiated in city centres. Often, standing boilers were used for reasons of space.

=== Mining and tunnel locomotives ===

For operation in tunnels or mine, O&amp;K built locomotives in compliance with specific profiles. In the case of steam locomotives, it was possible to run them at high speed by fitting suitable devices and using particularly large boilers that could store a larger quantity of steam before passing through the tunnel. For use during tunnel construction or in underground mines, steam locomotives with oil firing equipment were particularly suitable, whereby smoke development and spark emission did not take place. The handling of these locomotives did not differ in any other respect from that of an ordinary locomotive. Furthermore, fireless locomotives were also very suitable for operation in tunnels and mines, as they completely avoid the nuisance of smoke, gases and sparks. Compressed air locomotives, which, however, required a special stationary system to generate the compressed air were also made and sold in smaller numbers.

=== Fireless locomotives ===
Fireless locomotives were particularly suitable for use inside factories, yards etc., where it was essential to secure absolute freedom from any risk of fire. They were largely used for shunting purposes for paper mills, oil mills, wool mills, timber yards, gunpowder factories and similar works. These locomotives were constructed without fire boxes, the necessary steam being taken from a stationary boiler. The locomotive is able to work for several hours with one filling and can be operated with minimum expense as the driver needed less skills than that of a conventional steam engine.

=== Rack locomotives ===

O&amp;K delivered several types of cogwheel locomotives for mixed railways, on which ordinary operation alternated with cogwheel operation. Mixed railways were used in changing terrains with only single steep gradient, which could not be negotiated by ordinary adhesion locomotives. Accordingly, only these steep gradients were equipped with toothed bars. The mode of operation was as follows: The two steam cylinders outside the frame drove the driving gearwheel for the rack by means of a double gearing with the appropriate transmission. This driving gear wheel sat on a special axle fixed in the frame and was connected to the friction axles by coupling rods, so that the gear wheel axle and friction axles were driven simultaneously. The locomotives could therefore run on normal rail tracks as well as on toothed tracks. On the toothed track, the driving gear and the friction wheels worked together. The effect of the latter was also utilised on the toothed track and the load on the rack was relieved accordingly. The locomotives worked either on a simple flat steel rack or on Riggenbach ladder rack. A cumulative number of only 6 to 9 rack steam locomotives were made by O&amp;K in total. Their track gauge ranged from to .

=== Locomotives with a separate tender ===

Locomotives with a separate tender did not carry all their fuel and water on board the locomotive and were thus particularly useful for travelling long distances without being refuelled. The locomotives were equipped to be either heated by coal, wood or oil, because a larger heating and grate area were required. The main types had from four to twelve wheels for the locomotive and four, six or eight wheels on the tender.

The water tanks were firmly fastened to the frame of the tender, while maintaining a low centre of gravity. The coupling between locomotive and tender was similar to that of the waggons, to ensure that the locomotive could be driven without the tender for shunting or on short distances. The tender was easily accessible from the engineer&#x27;s cab. If the locomotive was heated by wood, the tender had a special fence to increase the volume of its load.

=== Coupled compound locomotives (Type 0-6-6-0, Kitson-Meyer design) ===
After Orenstein &amp; Koppel (O&amp;K) had delivered the prototype of a Kitson-Meyer locomotive for the gauge to the Chilean military railway in 1927, an order for three locomotives followed in 1937. In 1939, the locomotives with the factory numbers 13306 to 13308 were completed. The locomotives had riveted bridge and bogie frames. The boiler, cab, reservoir and ash box were also riveted. The engines located at the two bogie ends worked on the centre axle set. This wheelset could also be sanded. The control system was of the Heusinger type. While the prototype had a Westinghouse brake, the production locomotives had a Knorr brake. The air pump was attached to the rear water tank, while the main air tank was above it on the water tank. The locomotive had electrically operated headlights.

Due to the beginning of the Second World War, the vehicles could not be delivered to Chile. They were then tested by O&amp;K on the Rehagen-Klausdorf army training area and probably also on lines of the Mecklenburg-Pomeranian narrow-gauge railway. In 1944, the Deutsche Reichsbahn acquired the locomotives to use them on lines in occupied Poland. Therefore, in the second half of the same year, they were handed over to Gedob Direktion Krakow, where they were stationed at BW Jedrzejow.

<doc id="653559" wikidata="Q7502044" url="?curid=653559" title="Short form cricket">
<text>Short form cricket is a collective term for several modified forms of the sport of cricket, with playing times significantly shorter than more traditional forms of the game.

A typical short form cricket match can be completed within two to three hours, compared to 7–8 hours for a one-day cricket match, or five days for a Test match. They generally are limited overs cricket matches, with each team batting for a maximum of 5 to 20 overs (30 to 120 legal balls) depending on the format.

These short forms of cricket have been developed locally by various authorities, to fill a perceived marketing vacancy for a form of the sport which can be completed in a few hours, rather than a full day. They tend to emphasise the more &quot;exciting&quot; aspects of cricket as seen by more casual observers of the game, which includes aggressive batting and fast run scoring. In this regard, they are successful, as shortened forms of cricket attract crowds of spectators who might not otherwise attend a cricket match.

==T20 Cricket==
Although twenty-over cricket matches have existed for decades and remain the most popular amateur form of the game, the professional format Twenty20 cricket was introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003. It is a form of one-day cricket in which each team bats for a maximum of only 20 overs, contrasting with 50 overs for a standard one-day match. This means a game can be completed in about three hours, making it more palatable for children and families than longer matches. The players can also rest.

The English first-class counties participate in a Twenty20 Cup competition annually. Many games are played in twilight, again to enhance family spectator appeal. They also feature numerous musical &#x27;stings&#x27; for exciting events, such as the dismissal of a batsman, or the hitting of a boundary. Such fours and sixes are made easier to achieve by the shortening of the boundaries.

Major differences from the Laws of Cricket include:
* Should a bowler deliver a no-ball, his next delivery is designated a free-hit, from which the batsman can only be dismissed through a run-out, as is the case for the original no-ball.
* Bowlers may bowl a maximum of only 4 overs per innings, as is standard for 20-over cricket.
* Umpires may award 5-run penalties at their discretion if they believe either team is wasting time.

So far, Twenty20 has proved very popular with the public. On 15 July 2004, Middlesex vs. Surrey (the first Twenty20 game to be held at Lord&#x27;s) attracted a crowd of 26,500, the largest attendance for any county game other than a one-day final since 1953.

On 5 August 2004, New Zealand Women defeated England Women in the first international Twenty20 match, played at Hove in England.

On 12 January 2005, Australia&#x27;s first Twenty20 game was played at the WACA Ground between the Western Warriors and the Victorian Bushrangers. It drew a sellout crowd of 20,700 – the largest seen at the ground for many years.

On 17 February 2005, Australia defeated New Zealand in the first men&#x27;s international Twenty20 match, played at Eden Park in Auckland.

==100-ball cricket==
The 100-ball game was first proposed by the ECB in 2016, with the first club level games starting in England 2019. It was first played at the professional level by a new city-based competition called The Hundred, with 8 teams from England and Wales, that started in 2021.

==T10 cricket==

Ten-overs per team cricket matches introduced by T10 Sports Management. The company started T10 League in UAE in 2017. In August 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) officially sanctioned the league.

In October 2019, Cricket West Indies decided to host women&#x27;s exhibition T10 matches in the lead-up to the CPL 2019 final.

==90-ball cricket==

Ninety–90 Bash, also known as the 90/90 is an upcoming annual franchise-based 90-ball cricket league in the United Arab Emirates, with each team facing 15 overs. The first edition of the tournament is planned to be held in 2022.

==Evening cricket==
Amateur evening cricket is a version of T20 cricket that is played informally throughout the UK and the world. The rules are similar to those of Twenty20 cricket, with some modifications designed to speed the game up and to ensure that the game cannot be dominated by a small group of skilled players.

As with orthodox 20-over cricket, each team faces 120 deliveries, however instead of being split into 20 six-ball overs, these are split into 15 eight-ball overs. This reduces the amount of time spent moving between overs and enables the same amount of cricket to be played in a shorter time.

In contrast to orthodox cricket rules, an extra ball is not awarded following a wide or no-ball, in order to save time. Instead, two runs are added to the score instead of the usual one run. This rule does not usually apply for the last over of each inning to ensure that no strategic advantage can be gained from the deliberate bowling of a wide ball.

The fielding side is limited to three overs per bowler, or in some formats only two overs. This ensures that the majority of each team is required to bowl. The tactical implications of this rule for the fielding team captain are important as he must carefully decide when to bowl his experienced and inexperienced bowlers.

Batsmen are required to retire upon reaching a pre-agreed personal score, usually 25 or 30. Should the side be dismissed with a number of batsmen retired, they may then return to the crease in the order they retired. It is not unprecedented for a batsman to retire for a second or even third time in one innings. This rule ensures that the majority of a team will get a bat, and hence ensures the emphasis on the entire team both getting involved and being able to contribute to the final score.

This informal format of cricket is extremely popular in the UK and is seen as the ideal way for new or inexperienced players to be introduced to the sport. More than any other format of cricket, the outcome of the game is often decided by the joint contributions of all the players rather than a few highly skilled performers. This makes it an extremely enjoyable format for amateur cricketers to play.

==Six-a-side cricket==
Six-a-side cricket is a very short form of the sport designed to be played by teams of only six players. Each team receives one innings, with a maximum of only five overs. Naturally, with far fewer fielders, runs are much easier to score, and the sixes matches are typically frenetic affairs. As the games last less than an hour, sixes cricket is typically played in a tournament format with multiple teams competing at the same ground.

Other major changes to the Laws of Cricket include:
* Each player on a side is permitted to bowl a maximum of one over.
* Wides and no-balls score two extra runs each.
* If five wickets fall, the last batsman bats on. The last batsman to get out remains on the field as a non-batting runner, and the batsmen swap ends whenever the runner ends up on strike.
* A batsman who reaches or passes a certain number of runs, often 30 or 31 or sometimes 50, must retire &quot;not out&quot;. If one of the last pair of batsmen is out, a retired batsman may come in and resume his innings.
* In some formats of the game, hitting a &#x27;six&#x27; counts as 10 runs, and striking a &#x27;four&#x27; counts as six runs.

The Hong Kong Cricket Sixes is a six-a-side international cricket tournament held at the Kowloon Cricket Club and Mission Road Ground, Mong Kok comprising between eight and twelve teams. Organised by Cricket Hong Kong, it is sanctioned by the International Cricket Council. The tournament is designed for television viewing, with rules and a venue that encourage aggressive batting and high scoring. Because every player (except the wicket-keeper) is required to bowl one over, the format suits all-rounders.

Six-a-side cricket, or the similar Eight-a-side cricket, is a popular tournament format used in the UK that came to international prominence with the high-profile Hong Kong tournament.

The Six-A-Side-Cricket Federation of India was founded in 2002. It hosts inter-school and inter-university tournaments; it also organizes Sub-Junior, Junior, Youth, Senior, Federation Cup, and Zonal tournaments.

==Cricket Max==

Cricket Max is a defunct form of cricket invented in New Zealand by former New Zealand cricketer and captain Martin Crowe which was played primarily by New Zealand first-class cricket teams in an annual competition. International matches were also played between the New Zealand &quot;Max Blacks&quot; and England (1997), West Indies (2000) and India (2002). It was essentially a very short form of test cricket, with each team permitted two innings, but a maximum of only 10 overs for each innings.

Other major differences from the Laws of Cricket include:
* Each side bats two innings of a maximum of 10 overs each.
* Batsmen may not be out from a no-ball as usual, and also the next ball bowled after a no-ball. This is intended to encourage aggressive batting on the &quot;free hit&quot; ball.
* Wides score 2 extras instead of 1.
* Bowlers may not bowl more than 4 overs per match. These may be distributed between the two innings in any way.
* The field is marked with trapezoidal &quot;Max&quot; zones, one at each end of the field, beginning 60 metres from the striker&#x27;s wicket, where the trapezoid is 40 metres wide, and extending to the boundary, where the trapezoid is 50 metres wide. Any ball hit into the Max zone doubles the number of runs scored from that ball, whether by running between the wickets, or a boundary four or six. Fielders may not be in the Max zone as the ball is bowled. Only the Max zone in front of the striker is valid for all these rules.
* The first version of Cricket Max also included the use of 4 stumps, instead of 3, at each end of the cricket pitch. This was designed to help bowlers dismiss batsmen, as a batsman could not be dismissed leg before wicket.

==Super 8s==
Super 8s is a defunct short form of cricket devised by Greg Chappell for the Australian Cricket Board in 1996. The format was conceived as a way to financially reward the top-class domestic cricketers in Australia whose opportunities of making it into the significantly higher-paying Australian national side were limited. Matches were played outside the regular cricket season during the Australian winter at rugby stadiums with smaller rectangular fields such as Willows Sports Complex in Townsville. An international tournament was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in July 1996.

The changes from the usual Laws of Cricket include:
* Eight players per side
* 14 over matches
* All players except the wicketkeeper must bowl a minimum of one over, but no more than three overs
* A boundary 6 is worth 8 runs
* Batsmen must retire at 50 runs, but are allowed to return if balls are left in innings
* Last batsmen allowed to continue to end of innings, even after 7 wickets have fallen

<text>James O. Coplien, also known as Cope, is a writer, lecturer, and researcher in the field of computer science. He held the 2003–4 Vloeberghs Leerstoel (Vloeberghs Chair) at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and has been a visiting professor at University of Manchester.

He is known for his involvement in founding the pattern movement as part of the Hillside Group, organizing events in the Pattern Languages of Programs conference series, and his writings on software design patterns and organizational patterns.

==Career==
His ongoing work with Liping Zhao includes a monograph entitled &quot;A Generalized Formal Design Theory&quot; which explores the foundations of symmetry and symmetry-breaking in design in general, and in patterns in particular.

Cope was a founding Member of Hillside Group with Kent Beck, Grady Booch, Ward Cunningham, Ralph Johnson, Ken Auer and Hal Hildebrand. He has started up several of the conferences in the Pattern Languages of Programs (PLoP) conference series and is a longstanding pattern author and PLoP shepherd. His pattern form, the &quot;Coplien Form,&quot; is a simplified way to structure a pattern in preparation for writing a more literate version in Alexandrian form. Together with Trygve Reenskaug, he was a principal in the design of the data, context and interaction (DCI) paradigm.

He was also Program Chair of Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages &amp; Applications conference (OOPSLA) in 1996, and has been a co-founder and sometime chair of many software pattern conferences.

===Books===
Books he has written, co-written or edited include:
* 
* 
* 

===Research===
His early work on C++ idioms was one of the three primary sources of the popular &quot;Design Patterns&quot;. He also named the curiously recurring template pattern C++ idiom. His work on organizational patterns was an inspiration for both extreme programming and for Scrum daily standups. In &quot;Organizational Patterns of Agile Software Development&quot; book he co-presented an alternative version of Conway&#x27;s law.

===Presenter===
Coplien has presented several times in the UK at the ACCU conference:
* ACCU2010 Lean Architecture and Agile Software Development
* ACCU2008 Five practical solutions to Agile myths
* ACCU2008 Organizational Patterns: The Foundations of Agile
* ACCU2007 A balanced Agile design approach
He has given several conference keynotes, such as &quot;Reflections on Reflection&quot; at SPLASH 2013, &quot;Kaizen and Certification&quot; at the 2013 Scrum Alliance Regional Conference in Tokyo, and &quot;Objects of the people, by the people, and for the people&quot; at the AOSD Conference in Berlin in 2012.

<text>147 (one hundred [and] forty-seven) is the natural number following 146 and preceding 148.

==In mathematics==
147 is the fourth centered icosahedral number. These are a class of figurate numbers that represent points in the shape of a regular icosahedron or alternatively points in the shape of a cuboctahedron, and are magic numbers for the face-centered cubic lattice. Separately, it is also a magic number for the diamond cubic.

It is also the fourth Apéry number formula_1 following 19, where formula_2

with 147 the composite index of the nineteenth triangle number, 190.

There are 147 different ways of representing one as a sum of unit fractions with five terms, allowing repeated fractions, and 147 different self-avoiding polygonal chains of length six using horizontal and vertical segments of the integer lattice.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Norway on 12 and 13 September 1993. It was the first European election where the two largest parties fielded a female leadership candidate, and the first election in history where all the largest three parties fielded female leadership candidates. The Labour Party remained the largest party in the Storting, winning 67 of the 165 seats.

Voter turnout was 76% , the lowest in a national election since the 1927 elections. The prospect of European Union membership was a key issue in the election campaign.

<text>A conifer cone, or in formal botanical usage a [[strobilus]], : strobili, is a seed-bearing organ on gymnosperm plants, especially in conifers and cycads. They are usually woody and variously conic, cylindrical, ovoid, to globular, and have scales and bracts arranged around a central axis, but can be fleshy and berry-like. The cone of Pinophyta (conifer clade) contains the reproductive structures. The woody cone is the female cone, which produces seeds. The male cone, which produces pollen, is usually ephemeral and much less conspicuous even at full maturity. The name &quot;cone&quot; derives from Greek &quot;konos&quot; (pine cone), which also gave name to the geometric cone. The individual plates of a cone are known as &quot;scales&quot;. In conifers where the cone develops over more than one year (such as pines), the first year&#x27;s growth of a seed scale on the cone, showing up as a protuberance at the end of the two-year-old scale, is called an &quot;umbo&quot;, while the second year&#x27;s growth is called the &quot;apophysis&quot;.

The male cone (microstrobilus or pollen cone) is structurally similar across all conifers, differing only in small ways (mostly in scale arrangement) from species to species. Extending out from a central axis are microsporophylls (modified leaves). Under each microsporophyll is one or several microsporangia (pollen sacs).

The female cone (megastrobilus, seed cone, or ovulate cone) contains ovules which when fertilized by pollen become seeds. The female cone structure varies more markedly between the different conifer families and is often crucial for the identification of many species of conifers.

==Female cone of the conifer families==

===Pinaceae===

The members of the pine family (pines, spruces, firs, cedars, larches, etc.) have cones that are imbricate (that is, with scales overlapping each other like fish scales). These cones, especially the woody female cones, are considered the &quot;archetypal&quot; tree cones. The female cone has two types of scale: bract scale and seed scale (or ovuliferous scale), one subtended by each bract scale, derived from a highly modified branchlet. On the upper-side base of each seed scale are two ovules that develop into seeds after fertilization by pollen grains. The bract scales develop first and are conspicuous at the time of pollination; the seed scales develop later to enclose and protect the seeds, with the bract scales often not growing further. The scales open temporarily to receive pollen, then close during fertilization and maturation, and re-open at maturity to allow the seed to escape. Maturation takes 6–8 months from pollination in most Pinaceae genera, but 12 months in cedars and 18–24 months (rarely more) in most pines. The cones open either by the seed scales flexing back when they dry out, or (in firs, cedars and golden larch) by the cones disintegrating with the seed scales falling off. The cones are conic, cylindrical or ovoid (egg-shaped), and small to very large, from 2–60 cm long and 1–20 cm broad.

After ripening, the opening of non-serotinous pine cones is associated with their moisture content—cones are open when dry and closed when wet. This assures that the small, windborne seeds will be dispersed during relatively dry weather, and thus the distance traveled from the parent tree will be enhanced. A pine cone will go through many cycles of opening and closing during its life span, even after seed dispersal is complete. This process occurs with older cones while attached to branches and even after the older cones have fallen to the forest floor.

The condition of fallen pine cones is a crude indication of the forest floor&#x27;s moisture content, which is an important indication of wildfire risk. Closed cones indicate damp conditions while open cones indicate the forest floor is dry. As a result of this, pine cones have often been used by people in temperate climates to predict dry and wet weather, usually hanging a harvested pine cone from some string outside to measure the humidity of the air.

===Araucariaceae===

Members of the Araucariaceae (&quot;Araucaria&quot;, &quot;Agathis&quot;, &quot;Wollemia&quot;) have the bract and seed scales fully fused and have only one ovule on each scale. The cones are spherical or nearly so, 5–30 cm diameter, and mature in 18 months. For most species they disintegrate at maturity to release the seeds, although in some such as &quot;Araucaria bidwillii&quot;, the cone weighing up to is shed intact. In &quot;Agathis&quot;, the seeds are winged and separate readily from the seed scale, but in the other two genera, the seed is wingless and fused to the scale.

===Podocarpaceae===

The cones of the Podocarpaceae are similar in function, though not in development, to those of the Taxaceae (q.v. below), being berry-like with the scales highly modified, evolved to attract birds into dispersing the seeds. In most of the genera, two to ten or more scales are fused together into a usually swollen, brightly coloured, soft, edible fleshy aril. Usually, only one or two scales at the apex of the cone are fertile, each bearing a single wingless seed, but in &quot;Saxegothaea&quot; several scales may be fertile. The fleshy scale complex is 0.5–3 cm long, and the seeds 4–10 mm long. In some genera (e.g. &quot;Prumnopitys&quot;), the scales are minute and not fleshy, but the seed coat develops a fleshy layer instead, the cone having the appearance of one to three small plums on a central stem. The seeds have a hard coat evolved to resist digestion in the bird&#x27;s stomach.

===Cupressaceae===
Members of the cypress family (cypresses, arborvitae, junipers, redwoods, etc.) differ in that the bract and seed scales are fully fused, with the bract visible as no more than a small lump or spine on the scale. The botanical term galbulus (plural galbuli; from the Latin for a cypress cone) is sometimes used instead of strobilus for members of this family. The female cones have one to 20 ovules on each scale. They often have peltate scales, as opposed to the imbricate cones described above, though some have imbricate scales. The cones are usually small, long, and often spherical or nearly so, like those of Nootka cypress, while others, such as western redcedar and California incense-cedar, are narrow. The scales are arranged either spirally, or in decussate whorls of two (opposite pairs) or three, rarely four. The genera with spiral scale arrangement were often treated in a separate family (Taxodiaceae) in the past. In most of the genera, the cones are woody and the seeds have two narrow wings (one along each side of the seed), but in three genera (&quot;Platycladus, Microbiota&quot; and &quot;Juniperus&quot;), the seeds are wingless, and in &quot;Juniperus&quot;, the cones are fleshy and berry-like (known as ).
===Sciadopityaceae===
The cones and seeds of &quot;Sciadopitys&quot; (the only member of the family) are similar to those of some Cupressaceae, but larger, 6–11 cm long; the scales are imbricate and spirally arranged, and have 5-9 ovules on each scale.

===Taxaceae and Cephalotaxaceae===

Members of the yew family and the closely related Cephalotaxaceae have the most highly modified cones of any conifer. There is only one scale in the female cone, with a single poisonous ovule. The scale develops into a soft, brightly coloured sweet, juicy, berry-like aril which partly encloses the deadly seed. The seed alone is poisonous. The whole &#x27;berry&#x27; with the seed is eaten by birds, which digest the sugar-rich scale and pass the hard seed undamaged in their droppings, so dispersing the seed far from the parent plant.

=== Welwitschiaceae ===

&quot;Welwitschia&quot; is unique cone-bearing plant is not considered a conifer but belongs in the order Welwitschiales. &quot;Welwitschia mirabilis&quot; is often called a living fossil and is the only species in its genus, which is the only genus in its family, which is the only family in its order. The male cones are on male plants, and female cones on female plants. After emergence of the two cotyledons, it sets only two more leaves. Those two leaves then continue to grow longer from their base, much like fingernails. This allows it great drought tolerance, which is likely why it has survived in the desert of Namibia, while all other representatives from its order are extinct.

==Location and distribution==
Most conifer species are monoecious, with male and female cones occur on the same plant (tree or shrub), with female usually on the higher branches towards the top of the plant. This distribution is thought to improve chances of cross-fertilization, as pollen is unlikely to be blown vertically upward within the crown of one plant, but can drift slowly upward in the wind, blowing from low on one plant to higher on another plant. In some conifers, male cones additionally often grow clustered in large numbers together, while female cones are more often produced singly or in only small clusters. Some, such as &quot;Araucaria araucana&quot; and &quot;Taxus baccata&quot;, are dioecious, with the male and female cones usually on separate trees, but even in normally dioecious species, scattered individuals may produce cones of both sexes, or change which sex cones they produce over time. Some pines, notably &quot;Pinus discolor&quot;, are subdioecious, with individuals producing cones of both sexes, but with each tree producing either predominantly male, or predominantly female, cones, and only a few of the other sex.

A characteristic arrangement of pines is that the male cones are located at the base of the branch, while the female at the tip (of the same or a different branchlet). However, in larches and cedars, both types of cones are always at the tips of short shoots, while both sexes of fir cones are always from side buds, never terminal. There is also some diversity in bearing in Cupressaceae. Some &quot;Cupressus&quot; for instance, have little or no differentiation in the positions of male and female cones.
===Crop potential===
Cone crop potential can be predicted in various ways. An early indication of a potential crop can be a period of abnormally hot, dry weather at the time of bud differentiation, particularly if the current and preceding cone crops have been poor (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Estimates of cone crop potential can be made by counting female reproductive buds in fall or winter, and an experienced observer can detect the subtle morphological differences and distinguish between reproductive buds and vegetative buds (Eis 1967b).

White spruce seed collection is expensive, and collection from cone caches of red squirrels is probably the cheapest method. The viability of seed from cached cones does not vary during current caching, but viability drops essentially to zero after being in caches for 1 or 2 years. Collection of cones in seed orchards has been facilitated by the counter-intuitive technique of &quot;topping&quot; and collection of cones from the severed crown tops at one-third the cost of collection from untopped trees and without decreasing cone production.

==Pseudocones==

Most species of spruce are prone to the formation of pineapple gall pseudocones caused by the woolly aphids in the genus &quot;Adelges&quot;. These are not cones, although they closely resemble them. Alder (&quot;Alnus&quot;) trees are not conifers, but their mature seed bearing catkins closely resemble cones.

==Cultural uses==

Because of their widespread occurrence, conifer cones have been a traditional part of the arts and crafts of cultures where conifers are common. Examples of their use includes seasonal wreaths and decorations, fire starters, bird feeders, toys, etc. An intriguing derivation of the impossible bottle mechanical puzzle takes advantage of the fact that pine cones open and close based on their level of dryness. In constructing a display, a closed, damp cone of suitable size is inserted into a narrow-mouthed bottle and allowed to open upon drying.

Cone cows are traditional homemade toys, made by children using material found in nature. The most common design is a spruce or pine cone with sticks or matches for legs, which can easily be attached by forcing them between the cone scales. Playing with cone cows often includes building an animal enclosure from sticks. For the most part, cone cows have been displaced by manufactured toys, at least in affluent countries, but the creation of cone cows still enjoys some popularity as an outdoor activity for children. Cone cows are a part of children&#x27;s culture in Finland where they are known as &quot;käpylehmä&quot; and Sweden where they are known as &quot;kottkor&quot; (cone animals).

In Sweden, a video game was released in which the player may build virtual cone cows. Swedish artist Lasse Åberg has created artwork with cone cows, which has been included in an alphabet book and featured on a Swedish postage stamp among other classic toys.

Cones are used as decorative elements in architecture such as on top of the posts surrounding Koper&#x27;s Da Ponte Fountain, the central element of the in Rome, or a bronze cone in the narthex of the Aachen Cathedral. Cones are occasionally used as a charge in heraldic coats of arms. In some parts of Russia and Georgia, immature pine cones are harvested in late spring and boiled to make sweet preserves.
The pineal gland is named after the pine cone. Pine cones were also used as symbols of fertility in ancient Assyrian art. In Christian symbolism, they are closely related to the tree of life.

<text>The Concertino da camera for alto saxophone and eleven instruments was written by Jacques Ibert in 1935. Ibert dedicated the work to saxophone pioneer Sigurd Raschèr, who premiered the first movement in 1935. Later that year, Ibert completed the second movement, which was performed for the first time in its entirety by Raschèr in December 1935.

The work is in two movements; the first, &quot;Allegro con moto&quot;, is lively and technically challenging and the second begins with a lyrical &quot;Larghetto,&quot; featuring soaring lines in the saxophone&#x27;s upper register. A short cadenza links to the movement&#x27;s concluding &quot;Animato molto&quot;. The concerto is distinctive for its large range requiring the use of the saxophone&#x27;s top-tones.

The accompanying ensemble consists of flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, and double bass.

The piece shares similarities with his concerto for flute.

<text>Sara Paretsky (born June 8, 1947) is an American author of detective fiction, best known for her novels focused on the protagonist V. I. Warshawski.

==Life and career==
Paretsky was born in Ames, Iowa. Her father was a microbiologist and moved the family to Kansas in 1951 after taking a job at the University of Kansas, where Paretsky eventually graduated. The family rented an old farm house. Her relationship with her parents was strained; her mother was an alcoholic and her father was a harsh disciplinarian.

After obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from the University of Kansas, she did community service work on the south side of Chicago in 1966 and returned in 1968 to work there. She completed her AM (masters) degree at the University of Chicago in 1969 and completed a Ph.D. in history there in 1977; her dissertation was titled &quot;The Breakdown of Moral Philosophy in New England Before the Civil War&quot;. She also earned an MBA in 1977 from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

Her husband, Courtenay Wright, was a professor of physics at the University of Chicago; the two were together from 1970 until his death in 2018.

Paretsky is an alumna of the Ragdale Foundation. She was to appear in an amateur light opera production in 2011.

The protagonist of all but two of Paretsky&#x27;s novels is the female private investigator V.I. Warshawski, and the author is credited with transforming the role and image of women in the crime novel. The Winter 2007 issue of &quot;Clues: A Journal of Detection&quot; is devoted to her work. She is also considered the founding mother of Sisters in Crime, an organization that supports and promotes women in the mystery field.

<doc id="653608" wikidata="Q3257239" url="?curid=653608" title="Book of the Bee">
<text>The Book of the Bee () is a historiographic and theological compilation, containing numerous Biblical stories. It was written around 1222, by Solomon of Akhlat, who was Bishop of Basra, within the Church of the East. It is written in the Syriac language.

The book is a collection of theological and historical texts and consists of 55 chapters discussing various topics including the creation, heaven and earth, the angels, darkness, paradise, Old Testament patriarchs, New Testament events, lists of kings and patriarchs, and the final day of resurrection. The book was very popular among local Christian communities, and it was transmitted up to the 19th century.

The author, Solomon of Akhlat, was a bishop of the Church of the East during the first half of the 13th century. He was a diocesan bishop of Basra, now in Iraq, and was present at the consecration of the Patriarch of the Church of the East, Sabrisho IV, in 1222. He dedicated the book to his friend, bishop Narsai of Beth Waziq.

The book was written in Syriac, a literary form of Eastern Middle Aramaic, and it was also translated into Arabic. The author held his native Syriac language in high regard and adopted the notion of some older authors that it was the oldest language. 

The book was translated into Latin and published in 1866, by Joseph Schönfelder (d. 1913). In 1886, Syriac text was published with English translation, by British orientalist Ernest A. Wallis Budge (d. 1934).

<doc id="653621" wikidata="Q190924" url="?curid=653621" title="Michael Johnson (sprinter)">
<text>Michael Duane Johnson (born September 13, 1967) is an American retired sprinter who became Olympic 
Champion four times, and World Champion eight times in the span of his career. He held the world and Olympic records in the 200 m and 400 m, as well as the world record in the indoor 400 m. He also once held the world&#x27;s best time in the 300 m. Johnson is generally considered one of the greatest and most consistent sprinters in the history of track and field.

Johnson is the only male athlete to win both the 200 meters and 400 meters events at the same Olympics, a feat he accomplished at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Johnson is also the only man to successfully defend his Olympic title in the 400 m, having done so at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Aside from his Olympic success, Johnson accumulated eight gold medals at the World Championships and is tied with Carl Lewis for the fourth most gold medals won by a runner.

Johnson&#x27;s distinctive stiff upright running position and very short steps defied the conventional wisdom that a high knee lift was necessary for maximum speed. As of July 2024, Johnson holds three of the top 100 times for the 200 meters (having broken 20 seconds 23 times) and 22 of the top 100 times for the 400 meters. Of those, he holds nine of the top 25 times for the 400 meters. He broke 44 seconds for the 400 meters 22 times, more than twice as many times as any other athlete.

Johnson held the US national records for the 200, 300, and 400 meters. The 4 × 400 meters relay world record was anchored by Johnson.

Since 2001, Johnson has worked for the BBC, appearing as a pundit at multiple events. He has been a part of the BBC&#x27;s Olympics athletics coverage since Athens 2004.

==Career==
===1991–1995===
In 1991 at the World Championships in Tokyo, Johnson earned his first world title by winning the 200 m race by the unusual margin of victory of 0.33 seconds over Frankie Fredericks.

Two weeks before the 1992 Summer Olympics began, Johnson and his agent both contracted food poisoning at a restaurant in Spain. Johnson lost both weight and strength. He was the favorite to win the 200 m going into the Olympics, but he could do no better than sixth in his semifinal heat, and failed to reach the 200 m final by 0.16 seconds. Nevertheless, he was able to race as a member of the 4 × 400 m relay team, which won a gold medal and set a new world-record time of 2:55.74. Johnson ran his leg in a time of 44.73.

He won the 1993 U.S. title in the 400 m, and followed it with world titles in both the 400 m and 4 × 400 m relay. His 42.91 second split time in the 4 × 400 m relay remains the fastest 400 meters in history. At the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg, Johnson won his first 200 m and 400 m &quot;double&quot;. No elite-level male track athlete had accomplished this in a major meet in the 20th century. At the end he made it a &quot;triple&quot; by adding another title in the 4 × 400 m relay.

===1996 Atlanta Olympics===
In June 1996, Johnson was 28 when he ran the 200-m in 19.66 seconds at the U.S. Olympic Trials, breaking Pietro Mennea&#x27;s record of 19.72 seconds that had stood for nearly 17 years. With that performance he qualified to run at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and prepared to attempt to win both the 200 meters and 400 meters events, a feat never before achieved by a male athlete. (Two women have won Olympic gold medals in both races in the same year: Valerie Brisco-Hooks in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and Marie-José Pérec, in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.)

Johnson entered the Olympic finals donning a custom-designed pair of golden-colored Nike racing spikes made with Zytel, causing him to be nicknamed &quot;The Man With the Golden Shoes&quot;. Sources differ on the exact weight of these shoes; the manufacturer of the spikes claims they weighed each, while other sources state each shoe weighed about . The left shoe was a US size 10.5 while the right shoe was a US size 11, to account for Johnson&#x27;s longer right foot.

On July 29, Johnson easily captured the 400 m Olympic title with an Olympic record time of 43.49 seconds, 0.92 seconds ahead of silver medalist Roger Black of Great Britain. At the 200 m final on August 1, Johnson ran the opening 100 meters in 10.12 seconds and finished the race in a world-record time of 19.32 seconds, breaking by more than three tenths of a second the previous record he had set in the U.S. Olympic Trials, on the same track one month earlier—the largest improvement ever on a 200 m world record. Some commentators compared the performance to Bob Beamon&#x27;s record-shattering long jump at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. During the race, Johnson strained a muscle in his leg, which prevented him from winning his third gold medal of the Olympics in the 4 × 400 m relay as Team USA went on to win the gold even without him.

After the 1996 season ended, Johnson received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in any sport in the United States, and was named ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; Athlete of the Year. In August, HarperCollins published his biographical/motivational book, &quot;Slaying the Dragon: How to Turn Your Small Steps to Great Feats&quot;.

===Rivalry with Donovan Bailey===

After the end of the 1996 Summer Olympics, American Sportscaster Bob Costas claimed that Johnson was faster than 100m Gold medalist Donovan Bailey because Johnson&#x27;s 200m time (19.32 Seconds) divided by 2 (9.66 Seconds) was shorter than Bailey&#x27;s 100m time (9.84). This started a debate on whether Johnson or Bailey was the real &quot;World&#x27;s Fastest Man&quot;, which in turn resulted in a 150m race between the two, in which Bailey won after Johnson, already behind in the race, alleged to have injured his hamstring.

===1997–1999===
After recovering from the injury, Johnson was able to compete for his third 400 m world title. The IAAF invented a new policy of giving a &quot;bye&quot; to the defending champions essentially to allow Johnson to compete in the IAAF World Championships that year, because Johnson was unable to qualify the conventional method (by competing in the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships) due to his injury from the race with Bailey. Wales, Jimmy (2024)  date=May 2016 ]]More than a month after the U.S. Championships, Johnson had recovered from his injury and won the 400 meters at the 1997 World Championships in Athens.

At the 1998 Goodwill Games in New York City, Johnson anchored the U.S. 4 × 400 m relay team with Jerome Young, Antonio Pettigrew, and Tyree Washington to a win and set a world record of 2:54.20. Pettigrew has since admitted doping from 1997, while Young was caught doping in 1999. The world record was annulled by the IAAF in August 2008, and reverted to the time of 2:54:29 Johnson helped set in the 1993 World Championships.

Johnson was plagued by injury in 1999, and his following season was troubled with two injury scares that limited him to just four 400 m races before the 1999 World Championships in Seville. Were it not for the IAAF policy established two years earlier for Johnson, that allowed automatic entry to defending champions, he could not have raced in Seville since he failed to compete in the U.S. trials due to his injury. He recovered and won his fourth 400 meter world title with a new world-record time of 43.18 seconds at the relatively late age of 31 years and 11 months, which stood for 12 days short of 17 years before being beaten at the 2016 Olympics by the South African Wayde van Niekerk. Johnson&#x27;s splits for this world record were 21.22 seconds for the opening 200 meters and 21.96 seconds for the closing 200 meters, giving a differential of 0.74 seconds.

===2000 Sydney Olympics===
After qualifying for the 2000 Summer Olympics in the 400 m, Johnson sustained an injury in the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials for the 200 meters while racing in a highly anticipated matchup against the 100 m and 200 m world champion, Maurice Greene. The injury prevented a defense of his 200 m Olympic title. Johnson ended his career at the Sydney Olympics by winning the gold medal in the 400 m, which brought his total number of Olympic gold medals to four. By winning the 400 m at the age of 33 years 12 days, he earned the distinction of being the oldest Olympic gold medalist at any track event shorter than 5000 m. Johnson was also the anchor of the United States 4 × 400 relay team along with Alvin Harrison, Antonio Pettigrew, and Calvin Harrison, which originally won the gold medal, but was later stripped of the title after Pettigrew and Jerome Young (who ran in the heats) were found guilty of having used performance-enhancing drugs.

On July 18, 2004, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) ruled that Jerome Young was ineligible to compete in Sydney and annulled all his past results, including those achieved as part of relay teams. Young had competed for the USA team in the heats and semi-final of this event. Therefore, the United States team was stripped of the gold medal and Nigeria, Jamaica, and the Bahamas were moved up one position each. On July 22, 2005, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturned this decision and restored the original finish order of the race based on a ruling that a team should not be disqualified because of a doping offense by an athlete who did not compete in the finals. Then in June 2008, Antonio Pettigrew &quot;admitted in court he cheated to win&quot; by using banned performance-enhancing substances, and agreed to return his gold medal. Johnson announced that he would return his own gold medal, won as part of the relay team with Pettigrew. Johnson stated that he felt &quot;cheated, betrayed and let down&quot; by what Pettigrew had done at the Games. Pettigrew died by suicide in 2010.

==Achievements==

Johnson has run 200 m in under 19.80 seconds six times, and he has run the distance in less than 20 seconds twenty-three times. He holds nine of the top 50 200 m performances of all time. Johnson has run twenty-two 400 m races in under 44 seconds; he holds twenty-two of the top 50 and four of the top ten 400 m performances of all time. Over the course of his career, he twice set the world record in the 200 m, three times set the world record as part of the 4 × 400 m relay team, twice set the indoor 400 m world record, set the outdoor 400 m world record once, and set the 300 m mark once.

===Season&#x27;s bests===
==Beyond athletics==
Johnson was elected to the United States Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2004, where his 200 m performance at the 1996 Olympics was named the greatest track and field moment of the last 25 years.

Since retiring from competitive track in 2001, Johnson has worked as a television commentator, often for the BBC in the United Kingdom, where he has also written columns for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; newspapers. Johnson first appeared for the BBC in 2001 at the World Championships and at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. He subsequently was part of the BBC&#x27;s presenting team at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, 2012 Olympic Games in London, 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, and 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. He was in the BBC commentary booth for the men&#x27;s 400 meters final in Rio de Janeiro to see his world record broken by Wayde van Niekerk, saying about van Niekerk&#x27;s performance, &quot;Oh my God! From lane eight, a world record. He took it out so quick. I have never seen anything from 200 to 400 like that. That was a massacre from Wayde van Niekerk. He just put those guys away.&quot;

Johnson guest-starred in the 2002 film, &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot;, as one of the disguises Fabbrizio (James Brolin) takes on to borrow the U.S. Constitution, as part of a scheme by Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) to steal the world&#x27;s greatest treasures. Incidentally, one of the guards in that scene happens to be played by another actor named Michael Johnson.

In 2007 Johnson opened Michael Johnson Performance, at McKinney, Texas, a training facility for youth athletes aged 9 to 18 and professional athletes in all sports. The company works with Olympic teams and football clubs and has operations around the world. Michael Johnson Performance currently works with Arsenal, assisting in the development of young players in their academy.

In June 2008, Johnson voluntarily returned the 4 × 400 m relay gold medal he earned in the 2000 Olympics after Antonio Pettigrew, who ran the second leg, admitted he took performance-enhancing drugs between 1997 and 2001. Pettigrew made his admission while giving testimony in the trial of coach Trevor Graham for his role in the BALCO scandal. On August 2, 2008, the International Olympic Committee stripped the gold medal from the U.S. men&#x27;s 4 x 400-meter relay team. Three of the four runners in the event final, including Pettigrew and twins Alvin and Calvin Harrison, and preliminary round runner Jerome Young, all have admitted or tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Only Johnson and Angelo Taylor, who also ran in preliminary rounds, were not implicated. Johnson had already returned his medal because, as he said, he felt the medal was not won fairly.

Johnson appeared as a contestant on NBC&#x27;s 9th season of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot; (2010), placing 10th after exiting the show due to a personal issue on the fifth episode of the season first airing April 11, 2010.

As part of the build-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics, Johnson made a documentary, &quot;Survival of the Fastest&quot;, for Channel 4 which investigated the dominance of African-American and African-Caribbean sprinters. The program made the suggestion that a side effect of the slave trade may have been to accelerate natural selection as only the very fittest could survive the brutal process, resulting in a population predisposed to superior athletic performance.

Johnson was one of the Olympic torch bearers in the relay in the run up to the London 2012 Olympics, carrying it to Stonehenge and Salisbury Cathedral in Wiltshire.

In the summer of 2018, Johnson was co-captain and a coach for Godspeed, a flag football team made of former professional American football players that participated in the American Flag Football League (AFFL). The team were crowned the champions of participating pro teams but lost in the final match to the amateur champion team.

In September 2018, Johnson suffered a stroke that affected his left side. By November, he stated he was almost &quot;back to normal&quot;, and attributed his successful recovery to the &quot;Olympic mindset&quot;. In connection with his 54th birthday in 2021, he states that he has fully recovered.

In 2024, he launched a new Track and Field League, Grand Slam Track, ahead of a proposed 2025 season start.

==Personal life==
As of 2008 Johnson lived in Marin County, California, with his second wife Armine Shamiryan, a chef, and his daughter Selendis Sebastian, born in 2000 during his first marriage to entertainment reporter Kerry D&#x27;Oyen.

<text>[[Citizens Equity First Credit Union|CEFCU]] (&#x27;sef-kyü) Stadium, formerly known as Spartan Stadium, is an outdoor athletic stadium on the west coast of the United States, located in the Spartan Keyes neighborhood of central San Jose, California. Owned by San José State University, the venue is the longtime home of Spartan football; it also hosts the university&#x27;s commencement ceremony on Memorial Day weekend, and occasional high school football games. Known as Spartan Stadium for over eight decades, it was renamed in 2016.

CEFCU Stadium was the home of the San Jose Earthquakes (originally San Jose Clash) of Major League Soccer from the league&#x27;s inception in 1996 through the 2005 season. Other tenants have included the original San Jose Earthquakes of the North American Soccer League from 1974 to 1984, the San Jose CyberRays of the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association from 2001 to 2003, and the San Francisco Dragons of Major League Lacrosse in 2008. Soccer Bowl &#x27;75 was also held at CEFCU.

During the winter and spring of 2009, the stadium&#x27;s natural grass playing field was removed and replaced with FieldTurf, a new generation of artificial turf with a crumb rubber and sand infill. This improvement resulted in significant savings to the university in water use, fertilizer, seed and labor. The FieldTurf playing surface was later replaced with AstroTurf Rhino Blend in 2017. The playing field is aligned north-northwest to south-southeast, at an approximate elevation of above sea level.

The stadium also received significant upgrades to the scoreboard and sound system in 2011 and 2020. This included installation of an HD video screen by Daktronics at the south end of the stadium in 2011, and a new, much larger video board at the north end in 2020.

==Stadium history==

CEFCU stadium officially opened in 1933 as a 4,000-seat facility. The stadium featured large berms on the east, west, north and south sides of the field, which gave the stadium a &quot;sunken bowl&quot; appearance. The stadium&#x27;s seating capacity was increased to 8,500 in 1936, and later expanded incrementally to a total seating capacity of just over 18,000 by 1948. The most recent additions came in the 1980s when the capacity of the stadium was expanded from approximately 18,000 to just over 31,000 by adding end zone bleachers, an upper deck and boxes on the west side.

In 1998, the field was widened and other renovations were carried out for the San Jose Earthquakes soccer team in accordance with official FIFA regulations. As a result of these renovations, parts of the stands closest to the playing field were removed, thus lowering available seating for all sports to 30,456. 

On January 13, 2007, the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; reported that the city of San Jose, San Jose State University and the San Jose Earthquakes owners were in negotiations to demolish Spartan Stadium and build a new stadium just to the east. The new facility, to have 22,000 permanent seats but be expandable to a capacity of 30,000 for single games, would have been privately built by Lewis Wolff and John Fisher, the primary owners of the Earthquakes, with San Jose State providing the needed land. Additionally, the team and the university would build community soccer fields across Senter Road in Kelley Park using San Jose municipal bond money that had been approved years earlier for the purpose but never spent. The plan was for the new version of the San Jose Earthquakes to play in Spartan Stadium during the 2008 MLS season, then move into the new stadium in 2009. Plans for the stadium collapsed on April 19, 2007 after the Earthquakes and SJSU could not come to an agreement on revenue sharing. 

Seating capacity remained at 30,456 until 2019, when it was temporarily reduced to 21,520 as part of a massive east-side stadium renovation project that included construction of the $70 million Spartan Athletic Center. 

In August 2016, Citizens Equity First Credit Union purchased sole naming rights to Spartan Stadium for $8.7 million. The deal between CEFCU and San José State University will last for 15 years. SJSU was the first university in the California State University system and second university in the state of California to strike such a deal. The CEFCU sponsorship deal marked the third such arrangement among the 12 Mountain West Conference football members. The $8.7 million payout will primarily be used for athletic scholarships, athletics operations, and athletics facilities.

===Spartan Athletics Center and East-side Renovations===
A CEFCU Stadium east-side building addition was completed in August 2023 at an approximate cost of $70 million. Known as the Spartan Athletics Center, the 55,000 square-foot, multi-story facility houses a new football operations center, locker rooms, offices, meeting and training rooms and a sports medicine center. The facility also includes soccer team offices and locker rooms, as well as dining and hospitality facilities, event spaces and premium viewing areas. 

The east-side stadium renovation has temporarily reduced seating capacity at CEFCU Stadium from just over 30,000 to 21,520. Approximately 9,000 seats were removed from the stadium in 2019 to make way for the new building. This includes virtually all of the east-side stadium seating and some of the north end zone bleachers. The north end zone bleachers were removed to make way for construction of a new state-of-the-art video scoreboard and outdoor bar and lounge area. The new scoreboard was completed in 2020. 

As of 2023, a second phase of the east-side building and renovation project remains in the planning stages. The second phase is aimed at replacing spectator seating that was removed to make way for the SAC.

==Other uses==
The now defunct NCAA Silicon Valley Football Classic bowl game was held at CEFCU Stadium from 2000 to 2004.

CEFCU Stadium has hosted numerous FIFA events. Most notably the stadium was used as one of the venues for the 1999 Women&#x27;s World Cup. Additionally in 1999, the stadium was the host site of the 1999 NCAA Women&#x27;s College Cup.

The stadium previously hosted commencement ceremonies of San José State University every spring, as well as musical concerts throughout the year.

<doc id="653630" wikidata="Q3515540" url="?curid=653630" title="Tab stop">
<text>A tab stop on a typewriter is a location where the carriage movement is halted by an adjustable end stop. Tab stops are set manually, and pressing the tab key causes the carriage to go to the next tab stop. In text editors on a computer, the same concept is implemented simplistically with automatic, fixed tab stops.

Modern word processors generalize this concept by offering tab stops that have an alignment attribute and cause the text to be automatically aligned at left, at right or center of the tab stop itself. Such tab stops are paragraph-specific properties and can be moved to a different location in any moment, or even removed.

Sometimes, placeholders in code snippets are also called &quot;tab stops&quot; because the user can cycle through them by pressing the tab key.

== Types of tab stops ==
A tab stop is a horizontal position which is set for placing and aligning text on a page. There are at least five kinds of tab stops in general usage in word processing or in Microsoft Word.

;Left: text extends to the right from the tab stop.
;Center: text is centered at the tab stop.
;Right: text extends to the left from the tab stop until the tab&#x27;s space is filled, and then the text extends to the right.
;Decimal: text before the decimal point extends to the left, and text after the decimal point extends to the right.
;Bar: a vertical line at the specified position on each line in a document.

== Dynamic tab stops ==
In contrast to fixed positioning, tab stops can be adjusted dynamically, based on the length of adjacent tab-delimited line segments, by alignment to a specific character or string in each line, etc. Adobe InDesign supports a non-printing &quot;indent to here&quot; character.

In 2006, Nick Gravgaard published an algorithm for automatic dynamic tab stops called &quot;Elastic tabstops&quot;. This can be useful for viewing/editing source code and essential for tabular data. Various text editors and IDEs have implemented the elastic tabstops algorithm either directly or by extension.

=== Software which supports elastic tabstops ===
* Visual Studio
* Atom
* Textadept
* Code Browser
* JEdit
* Notepad++
* Go tabwriter package
* Rust tabwriter crate

<doc id="653636" wikidata="Q27249" url="?curid=653636" title="Civil solidarity pact">
<text>In France, a civil solidarity pact (), commonly known as a PACS (), is a contractual form of civil union between two adults for organising their joint life. It brings rights and responsibilities, but less so than marriage. The PACS was voted for by the French Parliament in October 1999, largely to offer some legal status to same-sex couples.

From a legal standpoint, a PACS is a contract drawn up between the two individuals, which is stamped and registered by the clerk of the court. In some areas, couples signing a PACS have the option of undergoing a formal ceremony at the city hall identical to that of civil marriage. Since 2006, individuals who have registered a PACS are no longer considered &quot;single&quot; in terms of their marital status; their birth records will be amended to show their status as &quot;&quot;.

PACS remain available to both same and opposite-sex couples despite the introduction of marriage and adoption rights for same-sex couples in May 2013.

==History==
The French National Assembly failed to pass PACS in October 1998. The law was proposed by the left-of-center government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and was very vocally opposed by people, mostly on the right-wing, who opposed LGBT rights. Those, such as Christine Boutin and Philippe de Villiers, argued that PACS and the recognition of homosexual unions would be disastrous for French society. Only one right-wing deputy, Roselyne Bachelot, declared herself in favour of PACS.

The law (&quot;Loi n°99-944 du 15 novembre 1999 relative au pacte civil de solidarité&quot;) was voted by the French Parliament in November 1999 following some controversy. The debate is remembered for a few incidents, such as when Christine Boutin attempted to filibuster the bill by speaking for five hours in the French National Assembly, and at some point waved a Christian Bible in the direction of the speaker of the Assembly—a surprising gesture in a country where &quot;laïcité&quot; (implying no intervention of religion into political matters) is specified in the Constitution. Christine Boutin also said, &quot;All civilizations that recognized and justified homosexuality as a normal lifestyle met decadence.&quot; Anti-PACS proponents also staged a series of street protests, but the turnout, by their own admission, was disappointingly low. At its creation, Jacques Chirac described PACS as &quot;not adapted to the needs of families&quot;. However, most initial opponents now widely accept the PACS (including Jacques Chirac and Christine Boutin, who publicly changed their minds).

It was to be a marked improvement and alternative over the previous &quot;certificat de concubinage notoire&quot;, which had minimal rights (and responsibilities) and had been seen as having pejorative overtones. The situation of &quot;concubinage&quot; only made certain benefits extend to the other partner in a union, and did not settle any issue regarding property, taxes, etc.

Initially, PACS offered the right to file joint income taxes only after three years. As of 2005, all PACS couples are required to file joint taxes, in the same manner as married couples. Due to the way that the progressive tax is applied in France, a couple filing joint income taxes, in almost all cases, pays less tax than they would filing separately if one of the partners earns substantially more than the other.

Wealth tax (the Impôt de solidarité sur la fortune) has been applied to the combined assets of both partners since the introduction of the PACS in 1999.

In 2004, PACS was described in a report to the Garde des Sceaux (minister for justice) as &quot;a new way of conjugality, answering many needs and inscribed in continuity&quot;.

In December 2004, the French Government began preparations for expanding the rights granted in PACS. French LGBT groups considered it a tactic for avoiding debate on same-sex marriage.

A parliamentary &quot;Report on the Family and the Rights of Children&quot; was released on 25 January 2006. Although the committee recommended increasing some rights given in PACS in areas such as property rights, laws of succession and taxation, it recommended maintaining prohibitions against marriage, adoption, and access to medically assisted reproduction for same-sex couples. Because of this, left-wing members of the committee rejected the report.
The report also argued that the differences in rights between concubinage, PACS and marriage reflect different levels of commitment and obligations on the part of the couples who enter into them. The committee renewed its support for this tiered system and recommended that the various rights and obligations of each type of union be clearly explained to couples when they register for a PACS, marry, or have a child.

==Figures==

According to the 2004 Demographic Report by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee), the number of marriages in France had fallen each year since 2000.

266,000 civil marriages took place in 2004, a decline of 5.9% from 2003. However, the report found that the number of couples getting PACS had increased every year except 2001. There was a 29% increase in PACS between 2001 and 2002 and a 25% increase between 2002 and 2003. For the first 9 months of 2004, 27,000 PACS were signed compared to 22,000 in 2003. The report found that one PACS in 10 had been dissolved (less than divorces for couples married for the same period, for which one marriage in three will be dissolved by divorce or separation after the first 3 years during which most signed PACS are dissolved before becoming more stable than marriages). 

A parliamentary report released in January 2006 said a total of around 170,000 PACS had been signed.
==New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna==
In April 2009, the French National Assembly voted to approve the extension of PACS to two French overseas collectivities: New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna. Thus, couples in New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna are able to enter a PACS in the same way as couples in Metropolitan France. Given their autonomous status, these collectivities did not automatically begin performing PACS when they were introduced in Metropolitan France in 1999. French Polynesia is the only collectivity where PACS cannot be performed.

==Current trends==
Although the law was passed with same-sex couples in mind, the great majority of couples taking advantage have been heterosexual couples who, for one reason or another, choose civil union rather than marriage; moreover, more heterosexual couples are opting for civil union rather than marriage. In fact, this trend was already in place in 2000, with 75% of unions between heterosexual couples (42% the previous years) and 95% in 2009. The process is commonly referred to as &quot;&quot; (, &quot;getting PACSed&quot;).

<text>Howard Michael Mandel (born November 29, 1955) is a Canadian comedian, television personality, actor, and producer. Mandel is known for voicing Gizmo in the 1984 film &quot;Gremlins&quot; and the 1990 sequel &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot;, playing rowdy ER resident Dr. Wayne Fiscus on the NBC medical drama &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, and creating and starring in the Fox children&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot;. He has also been a judge on NBC&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; since 2010, and Citytv&#x27;s &quot;Canada&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; since 2022. He hosted the American NBC and later CNBC game show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, as well as the show&#x27;s daytime and Canadian-English counterparts.

==Early life and education==
Mandel was born in Toronto and grew up in the Bathurst Manor neighbourhood of the city. He is Jewish, and his ancestors emigrated from Romania and Poland. Mandel is a distant cousin of Israeli violinist Itzhak Perlman. His father was a lighting manufacturer and a real estate magnate. Mandel attended William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute, where he was expelled for impersonating a school official and hiring a construction company to build an addition to the school. Afterwards, Mandel worked as a carpet salesman. He was a stand-up comedian at Yuk Yuk&#x27;s in Toronto, and by September 1978 he had a week-long booking as a featured act, which was billed as &quot;a wild and crazy borderline psychotic.&quot;

On a trip to Los Angeles, Mandel performed a set at The Comedy Store, which resulted in his being hired as a regular performer. A producer for the syndicated comedy game show &quot;Make Me Laugh&quot; saw him there, and booked Mandel for several appearances during the show&#x27;s run in 1979 and 1980. He was booked to open for David Letterman at shows in the summer of 1979. CBC-TV&#x27;s head of variety programming saw his performance in October 1979 and immediately signed him for a TV special. In 1980, he won the lead role in the Canadian movie &quot;Gas&quot;, co-starring Susan Anspach and Donald Sutherland. Mandel was one of the first &quot;VeeJays&quot; to appear on Nickelodeon&#x27;s music video series &quot;PopClips&quot;.

==Television and film career==
Mandel came to national attention in the United States during a six-year run on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, starting in 1982 and playing the role of Dr. Wayne Fiscus, opposite Ed Flanders and Norman Lloyd. He also appeared on a week&#x27;s worth of episodes of the short-lived NBC game show &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; in March 1984. While working as Dr. Fiscus and continuing to work as a comedian, Mandel also worked in films, including providing the voice of Gizmo in the 1984 hit &quot;Gremlins&quot; and its 1990 sequel, &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot;. In 1985, Mandel made a cameo in the Michael J. Fox directed short &quot;The Iceman Hummeth,&quot; which was subsequently broadcast on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in November 1985. In 1986, he starred in &quot;A Fine Mess&quot; alongside Ted Danson. He performed his stand-up comedy act in several cities (the &quot;Watusi Tour&quot;), which was followed by his &quot;Watusi&quot; music video in 1987. For the first two seasons of &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, he voiced Bunsen Honeydew, Animal, and Skeeter. He starred alongside Amy Steel in the 1987 comedy film &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot;. He was also &quot;Maurice&quot; in the 1989 movie &quot;Little Monsters&quot;. In 1990, he starred in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Good Grief&quot; on Fox. He was also the creator and executive producer of the Emmy-nominated children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot; (1990–1998) to which he supplied the voices of the title character and his father. &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot; ran for seven seasons on Fox and was later syndicated.

In 1992, his self-titled comedy show &quot;Howie&quot; was aired weekly with multiple guest stars including Gilbert Gottfried and Little Richard and Lita Ford as the in-house band guitarist. His character Bobby made a regular appearance on the show. In 1994, Mandel voiced the lead character, Little Howie, of the video game &quot;Tuneland&quot;. He starred in the sketch comedy series &quot;Howie Mandel&#x27;s Sunny Skies&quot; in 1995 on Showtime. Mandel appeared in the 1995 Clint Black music video &quot;Summer&#x27;s Comin&#x27;.&quot; He played the lead role of the professor in the short-lived TV series &quot;The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys&quot;, and he guest-starred on a 1996 episode of the ABC TV series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; as DC Comics supervillain Mister Mxyzptlk. In 1998, he hosted his syndicated talk show, &quot;The Howie Mandel Show&quot;, which was cancelled after one season. From 1999 to 2000, he played Jason in the film &quot;Apocalypse III: Tribulation&quot;, was the voice of Jack in the movie &quot;The Tangerine Bear&quot; in 2000, and 2002 he played the Sand Man in the movie &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;. In 2006, he appeared as himself as a guest host in a parody of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; in the show-within-a-show of the TV series &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;. In 2007, he guest-starred as himself in an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Medium&quot; and made a dream cameo of himself on &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. In that episode, he booted the nighttime drama&#x27;s protagonist off for &quot;cheating&quot; since in the show, he is a psychic medium and appeared to &quot;know&quot; the contents of the cases. Mandel plays his alter ego, Phil Skorjanc, in most of his comedy shows, which are a fan favourite. Bobby also made a cameo appearance in a February 2007 episode of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. On a special two-hour Christmas episode, first aired on December 25, 2007, Mandel delivered one line with Bobby&#x27;s voice, as requested by the contestant.

Mandel&#x27;s signature stunt as a stand-up comedian (besides his Bobby alter ego) was stretching a latex glove over his head, inflating it with his nostrils, and filling it until it suddenly propelled itself off his head. That trick also lent itself to the title and cover photo of his comedy album &quot;Fits Like a Glove&quot; (1986). He eventually gave up the routine under doctor&#x27;s orders after being diagnosed with a perforated sinus. However, in a cameo role as himself on &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, he did the routine. He guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;Monk&quot; (&quot;Mr. Monk Joins a Cult&quot; and &quot;Mr. Monk&#x27;s 100th Case&quot;).

==Additional appearances==
Mandel is known for his frequent appearances as a comedian and for his hidden camera segments on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. He has appeared in many television commercials for Boston Pizza as their hired spokesperson. In April 2004, he appeared as number 82 on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time. In October 2005, he was named to be the host of the American version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, which debuted on December 19, 2005, on NBC, and became a popular program in early 2006. Mandel also hosts &quot;Deal or No Deal Canada&quot;; originating from Toronto, &quot;Deal or No Deal Canada&quot; debuted in January 2007 on Global, which made him one of the few game show hosts (&quot;Weakest Link&#x27;&quot;s Anne Robinson, &quot;The Chair&quot;″s John McEnroe, &quot;Pyramid&quot;″s Donny Osmond, &quot;The Singing Bee&quot;″s Joey Fatone, and &quot;Minute to Win It&quot;″s Darren McMullen being others) to host both a domestic and an international version of the same game show. Mandel joins Alex Trebek, Jim Perry, and Geoff Edwards on the list of game show hosts who emceed one game show simultaneously in Canada and the United States.

In 2007, Mandel made an appearance in an episode of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; 38th season. Also in 2007, he was parodied on the show as Howie Eats well, the Muppet host of &quot;Sesame&quot;″s game show segment &quot;Meal or No Meal.&quot; Mandel has hosted the DVD game version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, &quot;Fact or Crap Beat Da Bomb&quot;, and &quot;Would You Rather&quot; for Imagination Games. Mandel had a cameo appearance as himself on the NBC show &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; in the episode where Earl&#x27;s roommates robbed an Indian casino at which Mandel was performing. While stealing money, they also kidnapped Mandel. In the episode, Mandel performed his old routine of inflating a rubber glove over his head with his nostrils.

Mandel is a notable alumnus of Beth David B&#x27;nai Israel Beth Am&#x27;s Hebrew School in Toronto, as well as three other Toronto high schools. He performs a variety/comedy act at the MGM Grand Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas. Beginning in 2007, Mandel became a spokesperson for Internet retailer buy.com. He is sometimes featured in a section called &quot;What&#x27;s Shakin&#x27;?&quot; with Mandel. On September 8, 2008, Mandel began hosting a five-day-a-week syndicated daytime version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, with a top prize of $500,000. On January 9, 2009, Mandel&#x27;s reality show &quot;Howie Do It&quot; premiered on NBC.

On March 31, 2011, Mandel premiered a flash-mob show on Fox called &quot;Mobbed&quot;. Originally a presentation pilot, the ratings after &quot;American Idol&quot; prompted Fox to pick up the show for eight to ten episodes. On October 18, 2012, Mandel appeared on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; as himself in the season 6 episode &quot;The Re-Entry Minimization&quot;. On November 30, 2012, he hosted the NASCAR Sprint Cup Awards Ceremony. On December 10, 2012, his six-night special game show &quot;Take It All&quot; premiered.

He appeared in one episode of the animated series &quot;Fugget About It&quot; as the voice of FBI Agent Rick Chickmagnet in 2013. From 2013 to 2014, Mandel executive-produced the TBS hidden-camera show &quot;Deal with It&quot;. He also regularly made appearances and co-hosted the show along with main host Theo Von. In 2023, Mandel competed in season nine of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;. He was eliminated on &quot;ABBA Night&quot; alongside Debbie Gibson as &quot;Night Owl&quot;.

===&quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;===
In 2003, while Mandel was deciding whether or not to quit show business, the executive producers at NBC asked him to host the show, but he declined many times. They then mailed him a tape of the overseas version and he finally accepted. In 2007, he hosted a five-episode run of the Canadian-English version &quot;Deal or No Deal Canada&quot;. The show then went to daytime with Mandel remaining as host, although Arsenio Hall was originally intended to host the show. In a January 2009 interview on &quot;Anytime with Bob Kushell&quot;, Mandel expressed mild, jovial frustration over how some of his contestants hold out during the game show, even though the grand prize is many times what they would make in a year.

On March 12, 2018, it was announced that Mandel would host the 2018 CNBC revival of the game show and also become an executive producer. The show premiered on December 3, 2018. Mandel is one of three game show hosts to host the same game show in two different countries, the others being Donny Osmond for &quot;Pyramid&quot; in the US and the UK and Anne Robinson for &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; in the US and the UK.

In 2024, Mandel was credited as an executive producer on the reality game show spin-off of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; titled &quot;Deal or No Deal Island&quot;. In the finale of the first season, it was revealed that he is the secretive banker who made offers to the contestants over the course of the game.

===&quot;Got Talent&quot;===
In January 2010, it was announced that Mandel would replace David Hasselhoff as one of the judges on NBC&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; after Hasselhoff announced that he was leaving to work on a new television series. Out of all judges on the show, Mandel currently has the longest tenure than any other judge or host, spanning sixteen consecutive seasons (season 5–present).

In October 2021, it was announced that Mandel will be a judge on the second season of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, which aired in 2022.

===&quot;Howie Mandel Does Stuff&quot;===
Since February 2021, Mandel has hosted the &quot;Howie Mandel Does Stuff Podcast&quot; with his daughter, Jackelyn Shultz, as co-host. According to the Apple Podcasts preview: &quot;Together, these two make prank calls, discuss pop culture, interview interesting people, say weird things, chat with listeners, get deep...&quot;

=== &quot;Bullsh*t: The Game Show&quot; ===
On April 27, 2022, Netflix released the 10-episode debut season of &quot;Bullsh*t: The Game Show&quot; with Mandel as the host of the program. It was Mandel&#x27;s first game show since the cancellation of the &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; revival on CNBC in 2019. In this game show contestants have a chance to win up to $1,000,000 by answering a series of trivia questions but have to also be able to convince (&quot;bullsh_&quot;) a group of prospective challengers that the answer they give is right, even if it&#x27;s not. (The contestant is shown whether or not their answer is correct as soon as they choose it.) After explaining their reasoning, the judges will vote on whether they think the contestant is &quot;bullshitting&quot; (lying), or telling the truth. At a certain time after they are done convincing the judges, Mandel will ask the contestant if their answer is correct, or if they were &quot;bullshitting.&quot; If the contestant&#x27;s answer is correct (or if it&#x27;s incorrect, but they successfully convinced at least one judge that they were telling the truth), they win and move on to the question. If they lie and none of the three judges buy it, they are removed from the game. The next contestant is the judge who most accurately guessed whether or not the contestant was truthful during each question.

==Other businesses==
Mandel is an avid tech futurist and has invested in many innovative startups. In 2021 he invested in MetaMedia&#x27;s MagicScreen which plans interactive experiences for movie theatres. In 2022, he became an investor and frequent user of Proto Hologram technology. He uses it both for his own appearances and to promote the startup such as when he beamed into JFK Airport Terminal 4 to surprise travellers. 

==Personal life==
Mandel has been married to Terry Mandel (née Soil) since 1980. They have three children.

On September 4, 2008, Mandel received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and Comedy Central listed him as No. 82 on their list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time. Mandel received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto. The induction ceremony was held on September 12, 2009.

In October 2008, Mandel revealed that he has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on the morning talk show &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, adding that he is currently working to raise adult ADHD awareness among the general public. On January 12, 2009, Mandel was reportedly sent to St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital in Toronto suffering from chest pains and what was reported as a minor heart attack. According to various news reports, he was experiencing an irregular heartbeat, but the reports were later revealed as inaccurate. He was later discharged. Mandel has written and published an in-depth autobiography which details his life with OCD, ADHD, and comedy called &quot;Here&#x27;s the Deal: Don&#x27;t Touch Me&quot;.

Mandel is a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. He is colorblind and a germaphobe. He contracted COVID-19 at the 2022 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, which caused him to miss parts of the third, eighth, and tenth episodes, and the entire seventh episode of the seventeenth season of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. The lockdown during the epidemic also led to physical and mental health struggles, including drug and substance abuse. Mandel lives in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles.

===Obsessive compulsive disorder===

Mandel has spoken publicly about having obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), which can take many forms, including mysophobia. Mandel&#x27;s anxiety affects him to the point that he does not shake hands with anyone, including enthusiastic contestants on &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; unless he is wearing latex gloves. Instead of shaking contestants&#x27; hands when they offer them, Mandel often opts to exchange fist bumps, put his hands on contestants&#x27; shoulders, or give an occasional hug. He once kissed a female contestant on the show for good luck despite his disorder. He now takes medicine to control his condition and even pokes fun at himself for it. On March 24, 2006, he revealed on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; that his shaved head is not related to natural hair loss but OCD. He stated that the lack of hair makes him feel cleaner. In the back yard of Mandel&#x27;s house is a second, smaller house which he had built especially to live in solitude when a family member is sick. During his appearance on &quot;Mad TV&quot;, Mandel and cast member Bobby Lee made fun of Mandel&#x27;s condition. Mandel also confronted his germophobia in Season 4, Episode 1 of the Comedy Central series &quot;This Is Not Happening&quot;. The show aired on February 3, 2018.

Mandel has reported a pivotal childhood experience during a family vacation in Florida that may have caused the manifestation of his mysophobia. During this trip, a sandfly laid its eggs in him, leading to the development of larvae that could be seen moving around just beneath the surface of his skin. The removal process was accompanied by considerable discomfort, with a dermatologist using liquid nitrogen to eliminate some of the larvae, and the rest being scrubbed out by his mother at home. The ordeal of discovering organisms growing beneath his skin left a profound impact on Mandel, who was only seven or eight years old at the time. Mandel says that recalling the event often evokes the sensation of organisms attempting to crawl underneath his skin.

While guest-hosting on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; in 2005, Mandel had an altercation in which his hand was seized by guest Rob Schneider, who condescendingly teased Mandel, stating he needed to &#x27;get over&#x27; his phobia. Host Kelly Ripa admonished Schneider on-air, while also obtaining hand sanitizer for Mandel from an audience member. In September 2007, Mandel interviewed former NFL running back Marshall Faulk on NFL Network. Faulk asked him to shake hands, but Mandel refused, noting he would rather have the fist tap, as he does with &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; contestants. Seconds later, Faulk subjected him to a &quot;sneak attack&quot; and shook his right hand. Mandel screamed and walked away from Faulk. He then washed his hands several times. On a guest appearance on &quot;Free Radio&quot;, Mandel explained that not only is he afraid of public bathrooms, but he is unable to use any bathroom other than his own.

During the ninth episode of season 5 of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in Chicago, contestant Zach Carty attempted an act involving sneezing. Mandel pressed his X button at the beginning of the act and ran into an aisle until the act was over. Carty was unable to perform the act. Mandel kept yelling at the other judges, Piers Morgan and Sharon Osbourne, to press their X buttons and for the audience to turn in his direction. Morgan eventually pressed the X button, but Osbourne refused, so Mandel promptly ran over and pressed her button, ending the act. In a backstage interview, he expressed to the television audience that he receives therapy to help him cope.

In another &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; season 5 incident, Dan Sperry, a contestant on the YouTube quarterfinal depicted in episodes 21 and 22, dropped some dental floss which he had run through his neck as part of a magic act. He dropped the floss in Mandel&#x27;s vicinity, prompting him to get up and run to the other side of the judges&#x27; table. Just before Sperry&#x27;s next performance in the semifinals, Mandel admitted that it was &quot;the most horrified&quot; he&#x27;d been on the show and that his therapist &quot;loves [Dan Sperry]&quot; because there had been two extra sessions that week. During the premiere of season 6, juggler Frank Olivier grabbed Mandel&#x27;s head to balance himself during a unicycle act. Despite receiving a buzzer from Mandel, Olivier moved on to the next round. Mandel refused to give Olivier any feedback during the judge&#x27;s voting process.

During &quot;AGT&quot; 10th-season premiere, contestant Chris Jones directly utilized Mandel&#x27;s fear of germs as the subject of his hypnotism act. Under the post-hypnotic suggestion that Jones and the other judges were wearing latex gloves, Mandel shook the bare hands of all involved, which elicited shouts of amazement. After viewing the video of the act, Mandel said that he was &quot;upset&quot; and &quot;somewhat betrayed&quot; by the act, but his therapist subsequently said it was a good thing. Jones progressed to the Judge&#x27;s Cuts where he was eliminated from the competition.

Mandel commented in 2011 that he has struggled with the condition since childhood but did not seek help until he was an adult: Since May 2022, Mandel has partnered with NOCD, a mental healthcare company focused on increasing access to evidence-based treatment for OCD and related conditions. 

===Philanthropy===
Mandel started his charitable foundation called Breakout the Masks, which helps provide personal protective equipment to healthcare workers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. He is also involved in Bell&#x27;s Let&#x27;s Talk Day initiatives to help people struggling with mental health issues.

<text>Johan Jørgen Holst (29 November 1937 – 13 January 1994) was a Norwegian politician representing Labour, best known for his involvement with the Oslo Accords.

Holst was Minister of Defence from 1987 to 1989 and from 1990 to April 1993. He then became Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position he held to his death. During his time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs he was heavily involved in the process that led to the Oslo Accords. He suffered a minor stroke in December 1993 and was admitted to a hospital. He never fully recovered and died a month later. His wife Marianne Heiberg later said that he had worked himself to death with the peace process.

In his memory, the city of Gaza created the Holst Park, an activity center for children of Gaza from 6 to 16. Holst was educated at Oslo Cathedral School, where he completed his examen artium in 1956. He then completed his mandatory military service at the prestigious Russian language program of the Norwegian Armed Forces. He then studied at Columbia College of Columbia University, where he obtained his A.B. in 1960 and where he was honored with its John Jay Award for Distinguished Professional Achievement shortly after his death—the first time the prize had been given posthumously. Through his marriage Mr. Holst was the uncle of Jens Stoltenberg, the prime minister of Norway throughout central parts of the 2000s.
Friends of Israel in the Norwegian Labour Movement (Norwegian: Venner av Israel i Norsk Arbeiderbevegelse), planted a forest to his memory in Israel.

<text>[[Muhammad Ali]] vs. [[Joe Frazier]] II, billed as Super Fight II, was a professional boxing match contested on January 28, 1974, for the NABF heavyweight title. The second of the three Ali–Frazier bouts, it took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

==Background==

On January 17, 1974, Ali and Frazier appeared together on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, where there was both humor and obvious tension – which included the removing of jackets and mock blows between the pair. Things dramatically escalated, however, on January 23, when Ali and Frazier visited the ABC studios in New York City five days before the rematch to review their first fight (the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot;) for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. During their critique, Ali began trash talking Frazier and calling him &quot;ignorant&quot; for mentioning Ali had visited the hospital after the bout, as he had put Frazier in one for a full month afterwards. This denigration enraged Frazier, who stood up from his seat and squared up to a seated Ali, repeating, &quot;Why you call me ignorant? How am I ignorant?&quot; While Frazier was not looking at Ali and studio crew and his entourage tried to calm him down, Ali grabbed Frazier by the neck to force him to sit down, which broke out into a fight on the studio floor. Both boxers were subsequently fined for their outburst, and significant drama added to the countdown to their rematch in the ring. Ali was a slight favorite going in.

==The fight==

The fighting was uneven, with flashes of excellence marred by Ali initiating 133 clinches, many by holding Frazier&#x27;s head and pushing down on his neck, which referee Tony Perez did not regard as a violation under the rules. Ali&#x27;s clinching dominated the fight. Many rounds were close and difficult to score and punch volume was unusually low for the two fighters, and for heavyweight boxers in general. Ali ended up landing 181 punches to Joe Frazier&#x27;s 172, with Ali leading on jabs 37 to 5 and Frazier on power punches 167 to 144; by contrast, in their first bout Frazier landed 378 punches (365 power) and Ali 330 (195 power). Frazier and Ali each landed more punches than the other in 5 of the 12 rounds, with 2 rounds even. Frazier was the more accurate puncher, landing 42% of his blows to Ali&#x27;s 25%. In the opinion of sportswriters Bob Cannobio and Lee Groves: &quot;Had they fought this way three years earlier, boxing would have been greatly harmed and the world probably never would have seen a second fight, much less a third.&quot;

Tactically, instead of fighting flat-footed in the middle of the ring and &quot;fighting Frazier&#x27;s fight&quot; as in their first, meeting, Ali came out dancing in his traditional &quot;Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee&quot; form. In the three years since he had been stripped of his titles and banned from the sport he had been able to recover much of the ringmanship on his toes he had lost since his 1967 professional ban. Still, he was older, heavier, and slower...as was Frazier. In hopes of making more contact with the relentlessly bobbing and weaving Frazier, he often employed a new punching style, flurries of a half-hook half-upper cuts coming from both sides. As in the first fight, Ali attempted to prevent Frazier from working inside, tying up the shorter man by holding him behind the neck with his left hand while keeping Frazier&#x27;s vaunted left tied up with the other. This pattern of Ali punching in flurries followed by clinching, and stifling Frazier&#x27;s advances and leaving him no room to throw his punches through neck-grabs and half-headlocks, dominated most of the fight, at times earning rounds of boos from fight fans. Explaining why he did not even warn Ali, referee Tony Perez explained, &quot;The only violation is if you [hold] and hit at the same time. Ali was holding but he wasn&#x27;t hitting.&quot;

Ali won a close but unanimous decision, with referee Tony Perez scoring it 6–5–1, judge Tony Castellano 7–4–1, and judge Jack Gordon 8–4–0.

==Aftermath==
Held in between their two major title bouts (the Fight of the Century in 1971 and The Thrilla in Manila in 1975, each for the then-reigning WBA and WBC professional boxing championships), this twelve round fight was promoted as &quot;Super Fight II&quot;. At stake was a chance for Ali to avenge his loss to Frazier in their first fight, and set up a shot for the world title against then Heavyweight champion George Foreman, who in between had dethroned Frazier. While some fans and experts then and now consider it to be the least interesting and hyped of their three fights, it provided flashes of excellence by both fighters, and was described by the Associated Press as &quot;...another great match between two different types of fighter, the slugger versus the master craftsman&quot;. Extremely anticipated at the time, it lacked the absolute drama of the first bout, but, evening the score at one win apiece, served to set the stage for the now iconic tie-breaker between the two historic champions a year later in Manilla, once again for World Championship recognition after Ali&#x27;s electric dismantling of Foreman in Zaire.

<doc id="653670" wikidata="Q28175" url="?curid=653670" title="Cockchafer">
<text>The common cockchafer (&quot;Melolontha melolontha&quot;), also colloquially known as the Maybug, Maybeetle, or doodlebug, is a species of scarab beetle belonging to the genus &quot;Melolontha.&quot; It is native to Europe, and it is one of several closely-related and morphologically similar species of &quot;Melolontha&quot; called cockchafers, alongside &quot;Melolontha hippocastani&quot; (the forest cockchafer)&quot;.&quot; 

The adults and larvae feed on plants, and are regarded as serious agricultural pests of crops such as grasses and fruit trees. Adults have harmful effects for the crop when they aggregate in large groups. The larvae can cause severe damage and kill the plant by gnawing the plant roots. The cockchafer develops via metamorphosis, in which the beetle undergoes stages of egg, larvae, pupae and adults.

The mating behaviour is controlled by pheromones. The males usually swarm during the mating season while the females stay put and feed on leaves. The leaves release green leaf volatiles when they are fed on by females, which the male can sense and thus locate the female for mating opportunity. The larvae use both the plant volatiles and CO2 to locate the plant root for food.

The number of cockchafers increased over the past few years due to the decrease in pesticide usage. Soil tilling can be used to remove larvae hatching. Entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes can effectively remove beetles at the larval stage.

== Distribution ==
Cockchafers are prevalent across Europe, including in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. They are particularly prevalent in temperate regions with suitable soil conditions for larval development. However, they have also been reported in parts of Asia, including Turkey and the Caucasus region. Geographical barriers, climatic conditions, and ecological factors may limit their dispersal to other continents.

== Description ==

=== Adults ===

Adults of &quot;M. melolontha&quot; reach sizes of in length. Behind their heads they have a black pronotum covered with short hairs. This black coloration distinguishes them from their close relative &quot;M. hippocastani&quot;, whose pronotum is brown. The top of their bodies have hard, brown elytra and a black thorax, while their underside is black and partly white on the sides. They have a dark head with two antennae with ten segments each. Male cockchafers have seven &quot;leaves&quot; on their antennae, whereas the females have only six.

=== Larvae ===

Larvae have 3 stages of development over the course of 3-4 years. In the first stage, they are 10-20 mm long, then grow to 30-35 mm in the second year of development, and finally reach their full size of 40-46 mm in their final year of development before emerging. In some areas of Eastern Europe the larvae develop for a fourth year. They have white bodies that curve into an arc with a black coloration at the abdomen and long, hairy, and well developed legs. They have large orange heads with strong, grabbing mandibles. On their heads they have 2 small antennae which they use to smell and taste their surroundings while underground.

== Food resources ==
Cockchafer feeds on deciduous plant and fruit tree leaves, including oaks, maple, sweet chestnut, beech, plum, and walnut trees. The feeding behaviour of larvae can cause severe damage to the plants. They feed on both the small roots of field plants such as grain, grass, tree, beet roots and the large part of crop rootlets. Larvae can gnaw the root for 30cm each day, which quickly kills the plant.

==Life cycle==

Adults appear at the end of April or in May and live for about five to seven weeks. After about two weeks, the female begins laying eggs, which she buries about 10 to 20 cm deep in the earth. She may do this several times until she has laid between 60 and 80 eggs. Most typically, the female beetle lays its eggs in fields. The preferred food for adults is oak leaves, but they will also feed on conifer needles.

The larvae, known as &quot;chafer grubs&quot; or &quot;white grubs&quot;, hatch four to six weeks after being laid as eggs. They feed on plant roots, for instance potato roots. The grubs develop in the earth for three to four years, in colder climates even five years, and grow continually to a size of about 4–5 cm, before they pupate in early autumn and develop into an adult cockchafer in six weeks.

The cockchafer overwinters in the earth at depths between 20 and 100 cm. They work their way to the surface only in spring.

Because of their long development time as larvae, cockchafers appear in a cycle of every three or four years; the years vary from region to region. There is a larger cycle of around 30 years superimposed, in which they occur (or rather, used to occur) in unusually high numbers (10,000s).

== Enemies ==

=== Predators ===
The European mole is a natural predator of cockchafers. Moles are known to feed on cockchafer larvae. They can detect them using their keen sense of smell and specialised digging behaviour. This predation can help regulate cockchafer populations in mole-inhabited areas. &quot;&quot;

&quot;M. melolontha&quot; adults are predated by ground beetles and ants. Larvae are predated by click beetles while underground. Starlings, crows, and gulls also predate &quot;M. melolontha&quot; larvae, often after a field has been plowed.

=== Parasites ===
&quot;Dexia rustica&quot; is a parasitic fly that uses &quot;M. melolontha&quot; larvae as their hosts. &quot;D. rustica&quot; eggs hatch underground and look for cockchafer larvae to hibernate within over the winter. Their presence will ultimately kill the beetle larvae in the spring. One to six fly larva can parasitise a single host.

== Behaviour ==

=== Mating behaviour ===
Males leave the soil when the temperature is favourable in April or May. Sexual dimorphism is observed as male beetles, at dusk, will begin to swarm and locate around groups of trees at forest edges. On the other hand, females will stay in place and feed on leaves until they reach sexual maturity. Males primarily fly around the branches looking for females to mate with.
 This behaviour occurs for several hours until darkness for about 10-20 days. These swarms typically have minimal damage to the trees, but they are occasionally harmful in cherry or plum orchards because of their consumption of blossoms. Once the females have matured and mated, they return to the fields to lay their eggs in the soil. Only a third of females will survive this trip, but any survivors will make a second, and occasionally third, swarming trip and return to the field to lay eggs again.

Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are a series of saturated and monounsaturated six-carbon aldehydes, alcohols, and esters released by vascular plants in response to stresses. GLVs have been found to act as a kairomone, which is a compound released by an organism that only benefits the receiver. This enhances the attractiveness of toluquinone, a sex pheromone in scarab beetles. Only male &quot;M. melolontha&quot; are attracted to GLVs, using its release to identify leaves that female beetles are feeding on. Females have the ability to detect GLV, but any change in behaviour that it may cause is unclear. &quot;M. melolontha&quot; males are more sensitive to lower GLV concentrations, possibly due to the anatomical differences between male and female antennae. Due to this phenomenon, sexual dimorphism can be observed in flight behaviour. During swarming behaviour, males will hover around the foliage while females remain on twigs and branches to feed. Males then use GLVs to identify which leaves have females that they can mate with. GLVs are being investigated as a possible pest control technique to attract males and prevent mating.

=== Pest behaviour ===
Though adults can damage some fruit trees, &quot;M. melolontha&quot; larvae are the primary agricultural pests. Larva hatch from their eggs 4-6 weeks after being laid and develop into adults over the course of 3-4 years. Immediately after hatching, larvae will gnaw on small roots. It will continue feeding on roots, particularly grasses, cereals, and other crops, during its three larval stages, only pausing to burrow deep into the soil for winter hibernation.

In their first stage, &quot;M. melolontha&quot; larvae identify roots by CO2 release. They will only do damage at extreme densities. In their second stage, larva will cause the most damage to crops. In their third stage, larva will do less but still severe damage to crops. They most prominently use structures on their antennae called pore plates to smell. This structure is a thin layer of cells that covers a number of sensory units consisting of dendrite bundles. These and other olfactory organs on the head of the larva can identify CO2 and plant volatiles. They&#x27;ve also been found to push their heads into the walls of their burrows and probe with their antennae, likely to taste the soil with bristle-like sensilla.

==Pest control and history==
=== Middle Ages ===
In the Middle Ages, pest control was rare, and people had no effective means to protect their harvest. This gave rise to events that seem bizarre from a modern perspective. In 1320, for instance, cockchafers were brought to court in Avignon and sentenced to withdraw within three days onto a specially designated area, otherwise they would be outlawed. Subsequently, since they failed to comply, they were collected and killed. (Similar animal trials also occurred for many other animals in the Middle Ages.)

=== 19th century ===
Both the grubs and adults have a voracious appetite and thus have been and sometimes continue to be a major problem in agriculture and forestry. In the pre-industrialised era, the main mechanism to control their numbers was to collect and kill the adult beetles, thereby interrupting the cycle. They were once very abundant: in 1911, more than 20 million individuals were collected in 18 km2 of forest. Collecting adults was an only moderately successful method.

In some areas and times, cockchafers were served as food. A 19th-century recipe from France for cockchafer soup reads: &quot;roast one pound of cockchafers without wings and legs in sizzling butter, then cook them in a chicken soup, add some veal liver and serve with chives on a toast&quot;. A German newspaper from Fulda from the 1920s tells of students eating sugar-coated cockchafers. Cockchafer larvae can also be fried or cooked over open flames, although they require some preparation by soaking in vinegar in order to purge them of soil in their digestive tracts. A cockchafer stew is referred to in W. G. Sebald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Emigrants&quot;.

In Sweden the peasants looked upon the grub of the cockchafer as furnishing an unfailing prognostic whether the ensuing winter will be mild or severe; if the animal has a bluish hue (a circumstance which arises from its being replete with food), they affirm it will be mild, but if it is white, the weather will be severe: and they carry this so far as to foretell, that if the anterior be white and the posterior blue, the cold will be most severe at the beginning of the winter. Hence they call this grub Bemärkelse-mask—prognostic worm.

=== Modern times ===
Only with the modernisation of agriculture in the 20th century and the invention of chemical pesticides did it become possible to effectively combat the cockchafer. Combined with the transformation of many pastures into agricultural land, this has resulted in a decrease of the cockchafer to near-extinction in some areas in Europe in the 1970s.

Since the 1970s, agriculture has generally reduced its use of pesticides. Because of environmental and public health concerns (pesticides may enter the food chain and thus also the human body) many chemical pesticides have been phased out in the European Union and worldwide. In recent years, the cockchafer&#x27;s numbers have been increasing again, causing damage to agricultural use of over of land all over Europe (0.001% of land).

Due to legal provisions from the European Union for the sustainable use of pesticides, aerial treatment, which had been used to successfully control &quot;M. melolontha&quot; populations, is now banned. Light traps have been successful in attracting &quot;M. melolontha&quot; adults, particularly males, when put at height (4 m). If a peak swarming time can be identified, shaking isolated trees and collecting feeding adults can reduce population, though it is time consuming. Azadirachtin is a chemical that inhibits maturation feeding and egg development, but low persistence and difficulty spraying it high enough in trees prevents widespread use. Soil tilling has been a historically successful method, particularly in early June when larvae are first hatching. Pre-cropping is also a promising possibility, with buckwheat being of particular interest because it can reduce grub weight and population density before the crop of interest is planted. Sex pheromones have been used for mass trapping, mating disruption, and “Attract and Kill” methods. The unlikelihood of developing resistance due to the sex pheromones being produced by the beetles makes this a promising method of pest control.

==== Entomopathogens ====
Entomopathogenic organisms—organisms that produce disease in insects—are an active area of research for the control of &quot;M. melolontha&quot; grub populations. Entomopathogenic fungi is currently being studied as a way to control &quot;M. melolontha&quot; grub populations. &quot;Beauveria brongniartii&quot; has been found to work on the &quot;Melolontha&quot; species, and &quot;B. bassiana&quot; has been successful with other agricultural pests. There have been difficulties with determining the best strategy to apply the fungi to the fields. Entomopathogenic nematodes have been found to be particularly successful ways of reducing populations, particularly when larvae are in the first and second stage. Entomopathogenic bacteria from the genera &quot;Steinernema&quot; and &quot;Heterorhabditis&quot; are also being investigated, but they have been difficult to apply to fields as opposed to laboratory settings. The focus on entomopathogenic bacteria has been on its symbiosis with entomopathogenic nematodes and their ability to act together as a larval control strategy. Poor results with the application of these methods have stemmed intensive research into the gut enzymes and microbiome of &quot;M. melolontha&quot; to determine if they are acting as defense against entomopathogenic organisms.

== Intestinal components and microbiome ==
The gut enzymes and microbiota of &quot;M. melolontha&quot; larvae allow them to exploit a variety of ecological niches unique to their phylogenetic family. These are low energy foods such as grass roots and rotting organic matter in the soil. There are two major compartments in the scarabaeid larvae intestinal tract. The first is a tubular midgut that secretes hydrolytic enzymes for macromolecule breakdown, and the second is a bulbous hindgut used for fermentation. High bacterial diversity between individuals of &quot;M. melolontha&quot; in the intestinal tract reflects the diversity of food sources.

In the midgut, glucose is broken down and absorbed by the epithelium. It has been shown that proteolytic breakdown of toxins is a common resistance mechanism for agricultural pests. Proteolytic activity of enzymes in the midgut is hypothesised to increase resistance to entomopathogenic bacteria in the beetle larvae. Trypsin-like enzymes from the midgut of &quot;M. melolontha&quot; have been found to break down certain bacterial toxins and inactivate them.

The hindgut has a high density of bacteria that ferment recalcitrant residues such as cellulose, with the byproducts being absorbed by the beetle. Acetate is a major product of this fermentation, suggesting that much of the bacteria in the hindgut is homoacetogenic. High abundance of species in the bacterial genus &quot;Desulfovibrio&quot; in the hindgut suggests that sulphate reduction is an important process, but the source of this sulphate in the diet is unknown.

Some research on the &quot;M. melolontha&quot; microbiome has been focused on increasing the entomopathogenic properties of nematodes used as pest control due to their symbiosis. Bacteria such as &quot;Xenorhabdus nematophila&quot; are transported by nematodes and released into the insect&#x27;s midgut. The bacteria will release lytic enzymes and other antimicrobial substances to decrease competition from the beetle&#x27;s native microbiome. This creates an optimal environment for nematode development. Bacterial species in the midgut of &quot;M. melolontha&quot; such as &quot;Pseudomonas chlororaphis&quot; have been found to fight back, acting as antagonists to entomopathogenic bacteria. These bacteria have been identified differentially in different larval stages, with &quot;P. chlororaphis&quot; usually being found in the third and final larval stage.

== Ecological impact ==
Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and plant type have a considerable impact on the existence and behaviour of cockchafers in wooded environments. It indicates that cockchafer populations are strongly influenced by climatic conditions, with warmer temperatures and higher humidity level favouring their occurrence. Additionally, specific vegetation types, including deciduous trees and shrubs, provide suitable habitats for cockchafers, facilitating their survival and reproduction within forest stands. 

==Etymology==
The name &quot;cockchafer&quot; derives from the late-17th-century usage of &quot;cock&quot; (in the sense of expressing size or vigour) + &quot;chafer&quot; which simply means an insect of this type, referring to its propensity for gnawing and damaging plants.
The term &quot;chafer&quot; has its root in Old English &quot;ceafor&quot; or &quot;cefer&quot;, of Germanic origin and is related to the Dutch &quot;kever&quot;, all of which mean &quot;gnawer&quot; as it relates to the jaw. As such, the name &quot;cockchafer&quot; can be understood to mean &quot;large plant-gnawing beetle&quot; and is applicable to its history as a pest animal.

==In culture==
Children since antiquity have played with cockchafers. In ancient Greece, boys caught the insect, tied a linen thread to its feet and set it free, amusing themselves to watch it fly in spirals. English boys in Victorian times played a very similar game by sticking a pin through one of its wings. Nikola Tesla recalls that as a child he made one of his first &quot;inventions&quot;, an &quot;engine&quot; made by harnessing four cockchafers in this fashion.

Cockchafers appear in the fairy tales &quot;Thumbelina&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen and &quot;Princess Rosette&quot; by Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy.

The cockchafer is featured in a German children&#x27;s song similar to the English &quot;Ladybird, Ladybird&quot;:
The verse dates back to the Thirty Years&#x27; War in the first half of the 17th century, in which Pomerania was pillaged and suffered heavily. Since World War II, it is associated in Germany with the closing months of that war as well, when Soviet troops advanced into eastern Germany.

According to one source, the dumbledore in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s 1899 poem &quot;An August Midnight&quot; is a cockchafer. However, in his novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, Hardy uses the dialect word dumbledore to mean a bumble bee.

There have been four Royal Navy ships named .

<text>The first election to the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) was held on 9 April 1964.

==Background==
The election happened at a time of very high political tension, with a general election due in a few months. The GLC did not come into its powers until 1 April 1965, but spent the first year setting up its committee structure and arranging with its predecessor authorities to take over.

==Electoral arrangements==
New constituencies to be used for elections to Parliament and also for elections to the GLC had not yet been settled, so the London boroughs were used as multi-member &#x27;first past the post&#x27; electoral areas. Westminster was joined with the City of London for this purpose. Each electoral area returned between 2 and 4 councillors.

The first election to the Greater London Council took place a month before the first election to the 32 London borough councils on 7 May 1964.

==Results==
===General election of councillors===
The Labour Party won a majority of seats at the election.

When the GLC was being planned, it was expected to produce Conservative majorities. However, many suburban Conservative-voting areas had successfully campaigned to be excluded from the Greater London boundaries. 

The large constituencies where the winner took all exaggerated Labour&#x27;s win in votes into a near two-to-one lead in terms of seats. It also made it extremely difficult for the Liberal Party to win any seats. 

With an electorate of 5,466,756, there was a turnout of 44.2%. Labour did particularly well to win Bexley and Havering, but performed poorly in Enfield which they might have expected to win. In Tower Hamlets, the Communist Party of Great Britain came in as runners-up with 8% of the vote.

===Aldermanic election===
In addition to the 100 councillors, there were sixteen aldermen elected by the council. The eight aldermen with the least votes were elected to serve until 1967 and the other eight until 1970. The aldermen were elected on 27 April 1964. 

Aldermen elected in 1964, to retire in 1967:
Aldermen elected in 1964, to retire in 1970:

The aldermen divided 11 to Labour and 5 to the Conservatives, and so the overall strength of the parties on the council was 75 Labour to 41 Conservatives after the aldermanic election.

==By-elections 1964-1967==

Less than a month after the election, Marjorie McIntosh (Labour, Hammersmith) died and precipitated a byelection; however, given that the voters had elected the GLC and the new London boroughs, the parties were short of money and the Conservatives decided not to oppose the Labour candidate who was returned unopposed on 18 June. Oliver Galley (Conservative, Harrow, died in October 1965 and the Conservatives retained his seat at a byelection on 27 January 1966. By the end of the term, there were two seats vacant due to the resignations of Sir Joseph Haygarth (Conservative, Barnet) and Mrs Mavis Webster (Labour, Waltham Forest).

There was one aldermanic by-election in 1965 caused by the resignation of Donald Soper (Labour). Frederick Lionel Tonge (Labour) was elected by the council on 6 July 1965, to serve until 1967.

<doc id="653674" wikidata="Q967333" url="?curid=653674" title="Melolontha hippocastani">
<text>Melolontha hippocastani, the northern cockchafer, is a species of scarab beetle native to Eurasia, with its range spanning from Western Europe to the Pacific coast of China. It is one of several species in the genus &quot;Melolontha&quot; known as cockchafers, alongside the common cockchafer (&quot;Melolontha melolontha&quot;) and &quot;Melolontha pectoralis&quot;, but generally at more northern latitudes, or at higher altitudes in upland woods further south. The adults are around 20–29 mm in length. It is distinguished from &quot;Melolontha melolontha&quot; by the shape of its pygidium, which is primarily black in colour. It primarily dwells in forests, and as such is also known as the forest cockchafer. The mate-finding behaviour in M. hippocastani is facilitated by plant volatiles and sex pheromones. Mating activities primarily takes place during the evening flight periods. Females lay their eggs in soil, and the larvae feed on decaying organic matter and later small plant roots, including the roots of young trees like pines and firs. The larvae usually develop between 3 and 5 years. They emerge between late April and the end of June. Like other cockchafers, they have been considered a serious pest of crops and trees.

== Geographic range ==
&quot;Melolontha hippocastani&quot; primarily resides in forest ecosystems in northern Eurasia. Its distribution range spans across most of Europe, excluding the northernmost and southernmost regions. This species extends its habitat into Mongolia, parts of Central Asia, and Siberia. Unlike its counterpart, the common cockchafer, which occupies diverse environments including forested and open areas, &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; is primarily a forest species, often in taiga forest.

== Genetics ==
Research has probed the genetic diversity in &quot;M. hippocastani&quot;. Researchers analysed microsatellite loci in over 200 individuals from three primary outbreak areas in Poland, and found significant genetic diversity within subpopulations. This research compared the genetic makeup of &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; to a different cockchafer beetle, the &quot;Melolontha melolontha.&quot; They demonstrated that both &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; and &quot;M. melolontha&quot; show considerable genetic diversity within subpopulations within sampling sites with minor effects of past bottlenecks possibly masked by current population sizes, which genetic similarities between the species. The estimates of effective population sizes indicated a large number of individuals contributing to further generations of the population, indicating a limited impact of forest management practices on &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; and &quot;M. melolontha&quot; alike. However, while genetic differentiation was observed in &quot;M. melolontha&quot; populations, &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; populations were genetically similar across populations suggesting a possible historical divergence between the two species. Further research is required to understand &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; genetic population structure.

== Mating behaviour ==

=== Mate searching ===
Mating behaviour primarily occurs during flight periods at dusk, during which beetles hover around tree tops. During this time, females and males mate several times, and mating lasts for several hours. Then the females oviposit in the soil, which causes severe tree damage from their feeding on tree roots. The swarming flights are mainly performed by males, while females stay in their host trees and continue feeding. Males are subsequently drawn towards damage-induced green leaf volatiles allowing location of mechanically damaged foliage, which allows males to locate females based on the leaves they have eaten. In order to distinguish between nonspecific leaf damage and damage caused by feeding females, male cockchafers orientate by a sex attractant. Research has investigated the role of sex pheromones of the scarab beetle on mating behaviour. 

=== Volatiles and sexual dimorphism ===
One study demonstrates that male &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; are attracted to volatiles emitted by damaged leaves and conspecific females. Although both male and female beetles showed a physiological response to these volatiles, only males exhibited behavioural responses, suggesting that the volatile response reflects a mate-finding strategy rather than a search for feeding resources.

A variety of compounds have been analysed in research to identify which compound serves as a sex pheromone in &quot;M. hippocastani&quot;, and the mechanism by which it takes action. One research study determined that mate-finding behaviour in &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; is driven by males locating females using olfactory cues such as green leaf volatiles and 1,4-benzoquinone, along with the species&#x27; sexual dimorphism. Both males and females contain 1,4-benzoquinone; however studies showed that female extracts provoked a higher number of landings than male extracts. This finding led to further analysis on the quantities of 1,4-benzoquinone in each sex, which were found to be higher in females, suggesting its role in attracting males. This compound, known for its defensive function in arthropods, is hypothesised to have evolved into a sex pheromone in &quot;M. hippocastani&quot;. Thus, research suggests a dual function of benzoquinones as both mate attractants and defense compounds. Further research is exploring other compounds&#x27; roles to develop semiochemical-based methods for controlling &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; populations.

=== The role of (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol ===
Additional research investigated whether volatiles from freshly damaged leaves are more attractive to males than those from older damaged leaves. Analysis of volatiles from freshly damaged leaves revealed typical leaf aldehydes, while older damaged leaves predominantly emitted (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. Surprisingly, males were equally attracted to volatiles from both fresh and old damaged leaves, with a preference for the latter in synthetic mixture experiments. Further experiments identified (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol as highly attractive to male beetles, while other tested compounds were behaviourally inactive. However, all tested compounds elicited comparable electrophysiological responses on male antennae. Thus, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol plays a vital role in the sexual communication of &quot;M. hippocastani&quot;, attracting both sexes of an insect.

Thus, a combination of plant volatiles and sex pheromones allow for males to find feeding females in the trees, facilitating mating behaviour. 

== Physiology ==

The mate finding technique performed by these beetles using sex pheromones are performed using specific physiologies. Melolonthinae sex pheromone glands are everted from the abdominal tip. &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; show sexual dimorphism within the antenna. Male antennae consist of seven large lamellae, while female clubs have only six smaller lamellae, which suggests different olfactory abilities between sexes and the presence of a female derived sex pheromone. Pheromone-degrading enzymes are present in the antennae of &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; and show considerable substrate specificity.
== Life cycle ==
Once adult female &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; lay their eggs in the soil, the larvae spend 36 months underground feeding on plant roots. During this time, their growth phase is divided into three distinct phases. They pupate in summer, the year before swarming, and spend their last winter as adults. The following year, in late April to early May, the adult insects emerge from the soil and feed on tree foliage. About 2 weeks after emergence, oviposition flights are observed. Females land on the ground at dusk and burrow into the soil to lay eggs in clusters. The females prefer sandy soils because they facilitate the females&#x27; digging, allow for larval movement, and allow volatile compounds from host to spread, facilitating the larval orientation and survival in the soil. Females lay an average of 24 eggs during their first egg-laying phase and 15 during their second egg-laying phase.

== Microbiome ==
Diet and digestion in &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; are facilitated by microbial symbionts residing in their guts. &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; larvae guts consist of two large compartments-- a tubular midgut and an enlarged hindgut. The midgut releases hydrolytic enzymes into an alkaline and oxidative environment, which threaten the development of bacterial species. The hindgut is an expanded organ specialised for anaerobic fermentation. Both regions have diverse bacterial communities, which are responsible for gut pH modification, the detoxification of plant allelochemicals and the maintenance of the microbial community structure.

Specifically, these microbes play a crucial role in breaking down woody food components such as lignocelluloses and xylans. When comparing the larvae and adult microbiotes of &quot;M. hippocastani&quot;, the larvae microbiotes had harsher conditions, yet harboured a richer and more diverse bacterial community compared to adult guts. A core group of bacterial phylotypes was shared between larvae and adults, indicating some degree of stability despite different feeding habits. Little overlap was observed between bacterial species from food or soil contamination and those in the gut, suggesting minimal alteration of bacterial diversity upon ingestion. Some isolates from larvae exhibited enzymatic properties related to digestion. This symbiotic relationship underscores the importance of microbes in the digestive processes across organisms.

Further research on the reactions of &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; to high manganese (Mn) content in their diet revealed significant effects on their activity and fertility. As the Mn content in their food increased, the activity of adult cockchafers decreased, and females fed on high Mn diets showed zero fertility. Despite the cockchafers&#x27; ability for self-detoxification, the presence of Mn in their diet still influenced their activity. It was found that expelling Mn through the digestive system serves as the primary mechanism for the cockchafers&#x27; self-detoxification process, showing the relationship between diet, digestion, and physiological responses in &quot;M. hippocastani.&quot;

== Interactions with humans ==
The parasitic nature of these beetles has caused damage on a wide variety of foliage, which has demanded an abundance of research for strategies to understand &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; in order to mitigate their harmful impacts and protect the forests in which these beetles are local. For example, in parts of southern Germany, specifically in the states of Hessen, Rheinland-Pfalz, and Baden-Württemberg, mass breeding of &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; has been observed every 30–40 years, which causes damage from adults feeding on the foliage between April and May. However, this damage can be compensated during a secondary sprouting period in June. Contrarily, grubs that develop within 3–4 years in the forest soil cause severe, long-term damage on young trees by feeding on roots. In northeastern France, specifically in the Vosges Mountains, &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; populations have been at epidemic levels since 2007, and high larval densities have been recorded, which induces a high mortality risk for forest plantations. Thus, these beetles can cause vast economic and ecological losses in oak-dominated forest. Extensive research continues to be performed on management of these pests. Specifically, research has shown that forests with a dense shrub layer have a negative effect on the density of egg clusters and the number of eggs in the soil, while forests with a canopy openness and the proportion of oak basal area have positive effects. Some theories for the destructive impacts of dense shrubbery on the ability of &quot;M. hippocastani&quot; to lay eggs in the soil include: the shrub acting as an impenetrable barrier, flight imprecision of the beetle, and the use of olfaction to sense the environment as methods with which the shrubbery could impact the egg laying behaviour. These techniques have potential to understand egg laying patterns to mitigate forest damage.

<text>The kris or  is a Javanese asymmetrical dagger with a distinctive blade-patterning achieved through alternating laminations of iron and nickelous iron (&quot;pamor&quot;). The kris is famous for its distinctive wavy blade, although many have straight blades as well, and is one of the weapons commonly used in the &quot;pencak silat&quot; martial art native to Indonesia. Kris have been produced in many regions of Indonesia for centuries, but nowhere—although the island of Bali comes close—is the kris so embedded in a mutually-connected whole of ritual prescriptions and acts, ceremonies, mythical backgrounds and epic poetry as in Central Java. Within Indonesia the kris is commonly associated with Javanese culture, although other ethnicities in it and surrounding regions are familiar with the weapon as part of their cultures, such as the Balinese, Sundanese, Malay, Madurese, Banjar, Buginese, and Makassar people. The kris itself is considered as a cultural symbol of Indonesia and also neighbouring countries like Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.

A kris can be divided into three parts: blade ( or ), hilt (), and sheath (). Each part of the kris is considered a piece of art, often carved in meticulous detail and made from various materials: metal, precious or rare types of wood, or gold or ivory. A kris&#x27;s aesthetic value covers the (the form and design of the blade, with around 60 variants), the (the pattern of metal alloy decoration on the blade, with around 250 variants), and referring to the age and origin of a kris. Depending on the quality and historical value of the kris, it can fetch thousands of dollars or more.

Both a weapon and spiritual object, kris are often considered to have an essence or presence, considered to possess magical powers, with some blades possessing good luck and others possessing bad. Kris are used for display, as talismans with magical powers, weapons, a sanctified heirloom (&quot;pusaka&quot;), auxiliary equipment for court soldiers, an accessory for ceremonial dress, an indicator of social status, a symbol of heroism, etc. Legendary kris that possess supernatural power and extraordinary ability were mentioned in traditional folktales, such as those of Empu Gandring, Taming Sari, and Setan Kober.

In 2005, UNESCO included the Indonesian kris in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;kris&quot; come from the Old Javanese term which means &quot;dagger&quot;. In Javanese, kris is known as () in the &quot;ngoko&quot; register, () in the register, and () in the vocabulary. In Malay (subsequently Indonesian and Malaysian), Sundanese, Balinese and Sasak it is spelled &quot;keris&quot; (Pegon and Jawi: کريس). Other names include &quot;karih&quot; in Minangkabau, and &quot;sele&quot; (ᨔᨙᨒᨙ) in Buginese and Makassarese.

Two notable exceptions are the Philippines and Thailand. In the Philippines, the kris and similar stabbing daggers are known as or , while the much larger slashing sword versions are known as or . The larger &quot;kalis&quot; sword was introduced from the Sulu Sultanate of the Philippines back to Kalimantan and Sulawesi in Indonesia, where it became known .

In Thailand it is always spelled &quot;kris&quot; and pronounced either as &quot;kris&quot; or &quot;krit&quot; (กริช) in Thai, while in the Yala dialect it is spelled &quot;kareh&quot;. In Cambodia it is spelled as &quot;kris&quot; (គ្រីស) in Khmer. Other alternative spellings used by Europeans include &quot;cryse&quot;, &quot;crise&quot;, &quot;criss&quot;, &quot;kriss&quot; and &quot;creese&quot;. In English, the plural form is often simply &quot;kris&quot; as well.

==History==
===Origin===

The term &quot;kris&quot; was mentioned in several ancient Javanese inscriptions originating from Hindu-Buddhist Mataram Kingdom of Central Java, including Humanding inscription (707 Saka or 875 CE), Jurungan inscription and Haliwangbang inscription (708 Saka or 876 CE), Taji inscription (823 Saka or 901 CE), Poh inscription (827 Saka or 905 CE), and Rukam inscription (829 Saka or 907 CE). Possible renderings of kris also appear on temple bas-reliefs such as of Borobudur (825) and Prambanan temples (850).

The description of a small dagger from Java reminiscent of kris can be found in Chinese source from the 10th century Song dynasty. In 992 the envoy from &quot;She-po&quot; (Java) arrived in Chinese court bearing a lot of gifts, consists of a dagger with exquisite hilt made of rhino horn and gold, silk woven with floral motifs made of gold threads, ivories, pearls, silk of various colours, fragrant sandalwood, cotton clothes of various colours, turtle shells, betel nut preparation kit, rattan mat with the image of white cockatoo, and a small model of house made of sandalwood adorned with valuable ornaments.

However, Raffles&#x27; (1817) study of the Candi Sukuh states that the kris recognized today came into existence around 1361 AD in the kingdom of Majapahit, East Java. The scene in bas relief of Sukuh Temple in Central Java, dated from 15th century Majapahit era, shows the workshop of a Javanese keris blacksmith. The scene depicted Bhima as the blacksmith on the left forging the metal, Ganesha in the center, and Arjuna on the right operating the piston bellows to blow air into the furnace. The wall behind the blacksmith displays various items manufactured in the forge, including kris. These representations of the kris in the Candi Sukuh established the fact that by the year 1437 the kris had already gained an important place within Javanese culture.

In &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot;—a record about Zheng He&#x27;s expedition (1405–1433)—Ma Huan describes that

This Chinese account also reported that public execution by stabbing using this type of dagger is common. Majapahit knows no caning for major or minor punishment. They tied the guilty men&#x27;s hands in the back with rattan rope and paraded them for a few paces, and then stabbed the offender one or two times in the back on the gap between the floating ribs, which resulted in severe bleeding and instant death.

Currently, the Kris of Knaud is the oldest known surviving kris in the world. Given to Charles Knaud, a Dutch physician, by Paku Alam V in the 19th century Yogyakarta in Java, the kris is on display at the Tropenmuseum, Amsterdam. The kris bears the date of 1264 Saka (which corresponds to 1342 AD) in its iron blade. Scientists suspect that due to its special features the kris might be even older, but was decorated during Majapahit period to celebrate an important event. The kris bears scenes from the Ramayana on an unusual thin copper layer which partially covers it.

===Development and distribution===
Although the people of Southeast Asia were already familiar with this type of stabbing weapon, the development of the kris most probably took place in Java, Indonesia. From its origin in Java, the use of kris spread throughout the Indonesian archipelago, Singapore, Malaysia, Southern Thailand and the Philippines through diplomacy and trade. The spread of the kris to other nations such as Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, some historians say, was credited to the growing influence of the Majapahit Empire in Java around the year 1492.

The &quot;Sanghyang Siksa Kandang Karesian&quot; canto XVII, a Sundanese manuscript dated from Saka 1440 or 1518 AD, describes the kris as the weapon of kings, while the &quot;kujang&quot; is the weapon of farmers. There exist claims of earlier forms predating the Majapahit kris but none are verifiable. In the past, the majority of kris had straight blades but this became less frequent over time. Tomé Pires, in the early 16th century, describes the importance of the kris to the Javanese.

=== Usage ===

While it is commonly believed that kris were the primary weapons wielded by fighters in the past, they were actually carried by warriors as a secondary armament if they lost their main weapon, which was usually a spear. For commoners however, kris were worn on a daily basis, especially when travelling because it might be needed for self-defense. During times of peace, people wore kris as part of ceremonial attire. Ceremonial kris were often meticulously decorated with intricate carving in gold and precious stones. Heirloom blades were handed down through successive generations and worn during special events such as weddings and other ceremonies. Men usually wore only one kris but the admiral Hang Tuah is said in the &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot; to have armed himself with one short and one long kris. Women also wore kris, though usually of a smaller size than a man&#x27;s. In battle, a fighter might have carried more than one kris; some carried three kris: his own, one from his father-in-law, and one as a family heirloom. The extra two served as parrying daggers, but if none were available the sheath would serve the same purpose.

Kris were often broken in battle and required repairs. Yearly cleanings, known in Javanese tradition as , is required as part of the spirituality and mythology surrounding the weapon, often left ancient blades worn and thin. The repair materials depended on location and it is quite usual to find a weapon with fittings from several areas. For example, a kris may have a blade from Java, a hilt from Bali and a sheath from Madura.

In many parts of Indonesia and the Malacca Sultanate, the kris used to be the choice weapon for an execution known as the &quot;hukuman salang&quot;. The executioner&#x27;s kris had a long, straight, slender blade. The condemned knelt before the executioner, who placed a wad of cotton or similar material on the subject&#x27;s shoulder or clavicle area. The blade was thrust through the padding, piercing the subclavian artery and the heart. Upon withdrawal, the cotton wiped the blade clean. In the Malay world and Java, an honourable form of execution was death by kris to the heart.

Kris were used commonly in battle, during the early modern period, instead of having professional armies, most kings within the region relied on their courtiers to mobilize for war whenever required and since most Javanese, Malay and Makassarese would own a kris, the weapon would have seen regular combat. During &quot;amok&quot;, the kris was used in a furious charge to scatter or kill a number of enemies even at the cost of one&#x27;s own life.

In the 16th century, European colonial powers introduced firearms into the archipelago that contributed to the decline of using the kris as the weapon of choice in battle. The forging of edged weapons went into decline from the moment that the sultans or rajas were subjugated and their realms annexed by the British or Dutch East Indies colonial state. In number of regions, a ban was placed on carrying of cutting and stabbing weapons.

In Java, the turning point was the end of the five-year-long Java War when the rebellious Prince Diponegoro was defeated and detained, and had to hand his kris over to the Dutch in 1830. This event marked the disarmament of the kris as a combat weapon among the Javanese populace. Its ceremonial function, however, as part of traditional costumes, as sacred heirloom and as a protective personal amulet, remains.

However, the kris saw continuous use and forging in the Philippines, which comprised most of the Spanish East Indies. Kris-forgers and swordsmen were referred to as &quot;juramentados&quot; by the Spanish. Juramentados practice a ritual of sacrifice, a form of Jihad against not only Spanish soldiers, but also against Christian Filipinos alike.

The early 20th century saw the decline of kris forging as carrying edged weapons was banned in the Dutch East Indies. However its spiritual and ceremonial function still continues and is celebrated mainly in &quot;kraton&quot; and &quot;istana&quot; (courts) throughout Indonesia, Malaysia and the Muslim-inhabited parts of the southern Philippines.

===Today===

In Java, the traditional art of kris-making is preserved in the Javanese culture heartland, the &quot;keraton&quot; (royal court) of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, and also the princedom of Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman. The Javanese kings and nobles of these courts are known to employ some kris blacksmiths (&quot;empu&quot;) and become the patrons of their works, although the activity of kris-making is declining. Until the 1990s, kris-making activities in Java had almost come to a standstill due to economic difficulties and changing socio-cultural values. However, thanks to several concerned kris experts, the tradition is being revived and kris craftsmanship has increased again.

Over the past three decades, kris have lost their prominent social and spiritual meaning in society. Although active and honoured smiths who produce high quality kris in the traditional way can still be found in some places such as Madura, Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Makassar and Palembang, their number is dramatically decreasing, and it is more difficult for them to find successors to whom they may transmit their skills. The traditional kris-making industry still survives in some villages, such as Banyu Sumurup village in Imogiri subdistrict, Bantul, Yogyakarta, either specially made as a sacred amulet ordered by a kris enthusiast who seeks its spiritual power, or merely as souvenirs for tourists.

==Description==
Physically, the kris is a form of dagger with a blade measuring between long, typically not sharpened as it is meant for stabbing and tearing, broader and asymmetric shape near the hilt, made of a combination of several kinds of metals. A kris&#x27;s aesthetic value covers the (the form and design of the blade, with around 150 variants), the (the pattern of metal alloy decoration on the blade, with around 60 variants), and referring to the age and origin of a kris.

===Blade===

The kris blade is called a or . Kris blades are usually narrow with a wide, asymmetrical base, one rare kind of kris with a broad blade is the &quot;keris buah beko&quot; in Kelantan and Java copying the shape of the &quot;oroxylum&quot; seed pod. The kris is famous for its wavy blade; however, older types of kris dated from the Majapahit era have straight blades, as do more than half of all kris prior to the modern era. The number of curves on the blade (known as &quot;luk&quot; or &quot;lok&quot;) is always odd. Common numbers of luk range from three to thirteen waves, but some blades have up to 29. In contrast to the older straight type, most kris today have a wavy blade which is supposed to increase the severity of wounds inflicted upon a victim.

According to traditional Javanese kejawen, kris contain all the intrinsic elements of nature: (water), (wind), (fire), (earth, but also interpreted as metal or wood which both come from the earth), and &quot;aku&quot; (lit: &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot;, meaning that the kris has a spirit or soul). All these elements are present during the forging of kris. Earth is metal forged by fire being blown by pumped wind, and water to cool down the metal. In Bali, the kris is associated with the nāga or dragon, which also symbolizes irrigation canals, rivers, springs, wells, spouts, waterfalls and rainbows; thus, the wavy blade symbolizes the movement of the serpent. Some kris have the head of a &quot;naga&quot; (dragon) carved near the base with the body and tail following the curves of the blade to the tip. A wavy kris is thus a &quot;naga&quot; in motion, aggressive and alive; a straight blade is one at rest, its power dormant but ready to come into action.

In former times, kris blades were said to be infused with poison during their forging, ensuring that any injury was fatal. The poison used to polish kris blade is called . The process of chemical coating was done by or (washing) the blade with acid and minerals that contains arsenic compounds. The process of doing so was kept secret among smiths. Different types of whetstones, acidic juice of citrus fruits and poisonous arsenic bring out the contrast between the dark black iron and the light colored silvery nickel layers which together form , damascene patterns on the blade.

===Pamor===

The distinctive patterns have specific meanings and names which indicate the mythical properties they are believed to impart. There are around 60 variants of recognized today in traditional kris blades. Some examples of include , , , and . The kris blade forging uses iron with a small content of nickel to create this pattern. The faint pattern has been found in the kris from Majapahit period, which was acquired from iron ores with small nickel content. Most probably this iron ore was imported from the island of Sulawesi, as the from Luwu region is quite well known in Sulawesi and Java.

The best material for creating however, is acquired in a quite unusual way, as it is made from rare meteorite iron. Traditionally the material for the kris smiths connected with the courts of Yogyakarta and Surakarta originates from an iron meteorite that fell to earth at the end of 18th century in the neighborhood of the Prambanan temple complex. The meteorite was excavated and transported to the keraton of Surakarta; from that time on the smiths of (the Royal territories) used small pieces of meteoric iron to produce patterns in their kris, pikes, and other status weapons. After etching the blade with acidic substances, it is the small percentage of nickel present in meteoric iron that creates the distinctive silvery patterns that faintly light up against the dark background of iron or steel that become darkened by the effect of the acids.

===Hilt===

The handle or hilt () is an object of art, often carved in meticulous details and made from various materials: precious rare types of wood to gold or ivory. They were often carved to resemble various animals and Hindu deities, although this became less common with the introduction of Islam. In Bali, kris handles are made to resemble demons coated in gold and adorned with semi precious and precious stones, such as rubies. In Java, kris handles are made in various types, the most common design being the abstract stylized representation of the human form. Examples of hilt designs include Tunggak Semi Putri Kinurung hilt from Surakarta, Batara Guru and Pulasir hilt from Madura, Punukan hilt from Palembang, Ratmaja from Bali, Pulungan hilt from Cirebon, Pekaka hilt from Pattani, and a seabird-like hilt from Lampung and Sulawesi. The kris usually has a curved pistol-grip hilt that aids in stabbing strikes. It allows the palm of the holding hand to add pressure to the blade while stabbing. A kris only offers minimal protection for the hand by the broad blade at the hilt.

===Sheath===

As with the hilt, a kris&#x27; sheath (&quot;warangka&quot;) is also an object of art. It can be made from various materials, usually a wooden frame to hold the blade which can be coated with metals such as brass, iron, silver, or even gold, usually carved in &quot;sulur&quot; floral motifs. The upper part of the sheath formed a broad curved handle made from wood or sometimes ivory. It could be adorned with precious or semi-precious stones.

==Forging==
The making of a kris was the specialised duty of metalworkers called &quot;empu&quot; (lit. &quot;possessor&quot;) or &quot;pandai besi&quot; (lit. &quot;iron-skilled&quot;). In Java the honorary title &quot;empu&quot; refer to those ironsmiths who possess the special skill of forging the kris. According to Javanese beliefs, a kris &quot;empu&quot; should possess knowledge, technical skills and also spiritual prowess, since kris are believed to have physical and spiritual presence. This was meant to differentiate the masters from common &quot;pandai besi&quot; that mostly create common metal tools or peasant&#x27;s weapons like &quot;parang&quot; or &quot;golok&quot;. In old Majapahit, a kris bladesmith was referred to as &quot;pande&quot; and all were reputed to be able to work hot iron with their bare hands. The people of Majapahit would eventually flee to Bali where the occupation has been preserved by the Pande clan to this day, members of whom also make jewellery. A bladesmith makes the blade in layers of different iron ores and meteorite nickel. Some blades can be made in a relatively short time, while more intricate weapons take years to complete. In high quality kris blades, the metal is folded dozens or hundreds of times and handled with the utmost precision. Empu are highly respected craftsmen with additional knowledge in literature, history, and the occult.

==Cultural beliefs==

Kris were worn at special ceremonies, with heirloom blades being handed down through successive generations. Both men and women might wear them, though those for women are smaller. A rich spirituality and mythology developed around the weapon. Kris are used for display, as talismans with magical powers, weapons, sanctified heirloom, auxiliary equipment for court soldiers, as an accessory for ceremonial dress, an indicator of social status, a symbol of heroism, etc.

In the Barong dance of Bali there is a segment called keris dance, in which the villain Rangda magically enchants Airlangga&#x27;s soldiers to commit suicide, while another magician makes them invulnerable to sharp objects. In a trance state, the male dancers stab themselves in the chest with their own kris but remain unhurt.

The kris dance is a potentially dangerous dance and can lead to fatal accidents. In February 2021, a 16 year old kris dancer was stabbed to death in his heart by his own kris, during a Rangda dance performance in Denpasar, Bali.

In Javanese culture the kris is revered as &quot;tosan aji&quot; (Javanese for &quot;sacred heirloom weapon&quot;) and considered a pusaka. The kris is believed to have the ability to infuse bravery upon its holder: this property is known as &quot;piyandel&quot; in Javanese which means &quot;to add self-confidence&quot;. The &quot;pusaka&quot; kris or kris-tipped spear given by a Javanese king to nobles or his subjects, was meant to symbolize the king&#x27;s confidence bestowed upon the receiver and is considered a great honor. During the Javanese wedding ceremony, a kris is required to be adorned with chains of jasmine flower arrangement as an important part of Javanese groom&#x27;s wedding costume. The addition of jasmine arrangement around the kris was meant as a symbol that a man should not easily be angry, cruel, fierce, too aggressive, tyrannical and abusive.

Kris-makers did more than forge the weapon, they carried out the old rituals which could infuse the blade with mystical powers. For this reason, kris are considered almost alive because they may be vessels of spirits, either good or evil. Legends tell of kris that could move of their own volition and killed individuals at will. Some kris are rumored to stand upright when their real names are called by their masters. It was said that some kris helped prevent fires, death, agricultural failure, and many other problems. Likewise, they could also bring fortune, such as bountiful harvests. Many of these beliefs were derived from the possession of different kris by different people. For example, there is a type of kris in Java that was called &quot;Beras Wutah&quot;, which was believed to grant its possessor an easy life without famine. This kris was mainly assigned to government officers who were paid, in whole or in part, with foodstuffs such as rice.

There are several ways of testing whether a kris is lucky or not. A series of cuts on a leaf, based on blade width and other factors, could determine if a blade was good or bad. Also, if the owner slept with the blade under their pillow, the spirit of the kris would communicate with the owner via dream. If the owner had a bad dream, the blade was unlucky and had to be discarded, whereas if the owner had a good dream the dagger would bring good fortune. However, just because a blade was bad for one person didn&#x27;t mean it would be bad for another. Harmony between the weapon and its owner was critical.

Because some kris are considered sacred and believed to possess magical powers, specific rites needed to be completed to avoid calling down evil fates which is the reason warriors often made offerings to their kris at a shrine. There is also the belief that pointing a kris at someone means they will die soon, so silat practitioners precede their demonstrations by touching the points of the blades to the ground so as to neutralise this effect.
==Legendary and historic krises==
Several folktales—linked to historical figures—mention legendary kris that possess supernatural power and extraordinary ability. Most of the magical kris are of Javanese origin, while the tales are mainly derived from Javanese ancient manuscript and Babad (Javanese chronicle).

===Kris Mpu Gandring===

One of the most famous legends from Java comes from the Pararaton (Book of Kings). It describes a legendary bladesmith called Mpu Gandring or Empu Gandring and his impatient customer, Ken Arok, in the last days of the Kediri kingdom in the 13th century. The customer ordered a powerful kris to kill the mighty chieftain of Tumapel, Tunggul Ametung. Ken Arok eventually stabbed the old bladesmith to death because he kept delaying the scheduled completion of the kris. Dying, the bladesmith cursed the kris through prophecy that the unfinished or incomplete kris would kill seven men, including Ken Arok. Ken Arok used Mpu Gandring&#x27;s cursed kris to assassinate Tunggul Ametung, cunningly put the blame to Kebo Ijo, and built a new kingdom of Singhasari. The prophecy finally came true, with four men enlisted as the kris&#x27; first death roll, including Mpu Gandring himself, Tunggul Ametung, Kebo Ijo to whom Ken Arok lent the weapon, and finally Ken Arok himself. The unfinished kris then disappeared.

Another version of the tale describes that the kris passed to Ken Arok&#x27;s stepson Anusapati which in turn killed his stepfather after recognized that his biological father was killed by Ken Arok with the same kris. The bloody feud continued on and on until the reign of Kertanegara, the last king of Singosari Empire

===Kris Taming Sari===
Taming Sari (&quot;flower shield&quot;) is one of the most well-known kris in Malay literature, said to be so skilfully crafted that anyone wielding it was unbeatable. In some versions of the legend, the weapon would grant its user physical invulnerability. The legend took place sometime during the fall of Majapahit Empire and the rise of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century. Tun Sri Lanang&#x27;s book, the Sejarah Melayu, tells that it was made by a Javanese empu and first used by the champion of Majapahit, a pendekar named Taming Sari. He was defeated in a duel to the death by the Melakan admiral Hang Tuah, after which the king of Majapahit presented the weapon to the victor.

After being framed by a jealous official, Hang Tuah was ordered to be executed, but he managed to escape and go into hiding with the help of a minister who knew the truth. Hang Tuah&#x27;s kris and title of Laksamana (admiral) were passed on to his comrade Hang Jebat. Furious that his best friend was unfairly put to death, Hang Jebat rebelled against the royalty and took over the palace. The desperate ruler of Melaka pardoned the minister so long as Hang Tuah could win him back the throne. Having trained under the same master since childhood the two friends were nearly equals but of the two, Tuah was the superior fighter. However, even after a long battle in the palace, neither could best the other because the Kris Taming Sari evened the odds. Only after taking his weapon back did Hang Tuah manage to stab Jebat, who died soon after.

===Kris Setan Kober===
Javanese folk story tells of Arya Penangsang, the mighty viceroy (&quot;adipati&quot;) of Jipang who was killed by his own kris called Setan Kober (&quot;devil of the grave&quot;). It was forged by Empu Bayu Aji in the kingdom of Pajajaran, and had 13 luk on its blade. Near its completion when the empu tried to infuse the weapon with spiritual power, he was disturbed by a crying demon (djinn) from the graveyard. As a result, although powerful, the kris had a temperamental evil nature that caused the wielder to be overly ambitious and impatient.

The story took place in the 16th century, during the fall of Demak Sultanate that had replaced Majapahit as the ruler of Java. Setan Kober was safely kept by Sunan Kudus, one of the nine Islamic saints of Java. However Sunan Prawoto, son of Prince Trenggana and grandson of Raden Patah, stole it and used it to assassinate his uncle Raden Kikin by the river. Since then, Raden Kikin is also referred to as Sekar Seda Lepen (flower that fell by the river). Raden Trenggana rose as a sultan and later after his death, was replaced by Sunan Prawoto. Kikin&#x27;s son, Penangsang of Jipang with the help of his teacher, Sunan Kudus, took revenge by sending an assassin to kill Prawoto using the Setan Kober kris. Prawoto younger sister Ratu Kalinyamat seeks revenge on Penangsang, since Penangsang also murdered her husband. She urged her brother in-law, Hadiwijaya (Joko Tingkir) the ruler of Pajang, to kill Arya Penangsang. Hadiwijaya sent his adopted son and also his son in-law Sutawijaya, who would later become the first ruler of the Mataram dynasty.
During a battle, Sutawijaya stabbed Penangsang with the Kyai Plered spear in the gut. However, Penangsang was believed to possess &quot;aji&quot; or &quot;kesaktian&quot; (spiritual power), he kept fighting with an open wound in the stomach. He encircled his hanging intestines on his kris hilt, and continued to fight. When trying to attack his opponent, the reckless, fierce and impatient Panangsang pulled his Setan Kober off its sheath, but accidentally cut his own intestines and died.

The Javanese tradition of putting jasmine garlands around the kris hilt, especially on groom&#x27;s kris during the wedding ceremony, is said to originate from this tale. It is to symbolize that the groom should not be reckless, easily get angry, impatient and abusive like Arya Panangsang. To replace the intestine, the kris is coiled with a floral garland of jasmine chain that resemble intestine. The jasmine is to symbolize sacredness, patience, grace, humility, kindness and benevolence, the qualities lack in Panangsang. However another source mentioned that actually Sutawijaya admired Penangsang&#x27;s fighting spirits, still fighting although his intestine encircled around his kris. Impressed by Penangsang&#x27;s deed, later he command his male descendants to follow his step, adorned the kris with &quot;intestine&quot; made from the chain of jasmine, as a symbol of bravery. The story of Arya Penangsang has inspired and performed as Javanese ketoprak drama.

===Kris Diponegoro===

During the Royal Netherlands state visit to Indonesia in March 2020, King Willem-Alexander returned the kris of Prince Diponegoro to 
Indonesia, received by President Joko Widodo. Today considered as Indonesian national hero, Prince Diponegoro of Yogyakarta was the charismatic leader of the mass rebellion against Dutch colonial rule in Central Java, that was defeated and taken prisoner after the conclusion of Java War in 1830. His kris was long considered lost, but has now been found, after being identified by the Dutch National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. The kris of Prince Diponegoro represents a historic importance, as a symbol of Indonesian heroic resilience and the nation&#x27;s struggle for independence. The extraordinary gold-inlaid Javanese dagger previously was held as the Dutch state collection, and is now part of the collection of the Indonesian National Museum. There is great doubt whether the Kris is the original Kris of Dipenegoro. Experts think not.

==Symbolism==

Throughout the archipelago, the &quot;kris&quot; is a symbol of heroism, martial prowess, power and authority. As a cultural symbol, the meticulously decorated kris represent refinement, art and beauty, as the pride and prized possession for its owner; however, as a weapon it is associated with violence, death and bloodshed. Probably for this reason, although the kris is widespread in Javanese culture, it is not used to symbolise Javanese culture or royalty, as Javanese tradition promotes harmony and discourages direct confrontation (hence the absence of knives on Indonesian dinner tables). This is also why the Javanese traditionally wear the kris on their back, to symbolize violence as the last resort. Balinese and Sundanese also wearing kris on their back. However, in other parts of archipelago, from Sumatra to the Malay Peninsula and to Sulawesi, the kris is worn on the front or left side on the hip.

The kris is depicted on different flags, emblems, coats and logos such as those of the Aceh Sultanate Mataram Sultanate, Riau Islands Province, Terengganu and Selangor. The former emblem of Siam uses the kris to represent the southern territories. It can also be seen on an obverse copper-zinc-tin RM1 coin with a songket pattern in the background. The Malaya and British Borneo dollar 1 cent coin of 1962 also depicted a pair of crossed kris.

In the British colonies of future Federation of Malaya, the kris has become a symbol of early Malay nationalism (see Malaya&#x27;s proposed flag designs); especially of the ethno-majoritarian right-wing &quot;ketuanan Melayu&quot; strain decades on post-independence; it is incorporated into the&quot;Sang Saka Bangsa&quot;, party flag of United Malays National Organisation once dominant in Malaysian politics.

In the Philippines, the kalis, a larger sword variant of the &quot;kris&quot;, is a symbol of Moro and southern Filipino culture, and a resistance to Spanish rule and influence. It is incorporated into the flags of the Moro National Liberation Front and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. It has also been incorporated into the flag of Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, historical flags of the Sultanate of Sulu, as well as the emblem of the Cotabato Province.

<text>Yoder is a surname of Swiss German origin of which the original spelling is Joder. It originated from the Canton of Bern in Switzerland. The name dates back to at least 1260, and is a shortened version of the name Theodore.
Saint Yoder (died ) is a patron saint of Valais, probably the first bishop of Octodurum.

==Origin of the surname==
&quot;Jodershubel&quot; — German for &quot;Yoder Hill&quot; — is a natural hill on the Emme River in the Swiss Canton of Bern. German researcher Karl Joder of Ludwigshafen am Rhein believes that the Yoder family was established in the region surrounding the hill before recorded history. The oldest known documentation of the Yoder family is a 1260 record of the birth of a Peter Joder in &quot;Joderhuebel&quot;.

==Diaspora==
Yoders were a part of a larger German migration to America between 1650 and 1730. When the Quaker William Penn established the colony of Pennsylvania, he opened it to all religious faiths, allowing complete religious freedom and worship. He sent agents into the Rhine Valley and the Rhineland-Palatinate announcing the opportunities for settlement in his colony and assuring emigrants they would be allowed freedom of worship. Germans of all faiths came to the new colony by the thousands. They found their way down the Rhine River to Rotterdam, the great Dutch port, and embarked on slow sailing boats for Philadelphia. Between 1700 and 1775 more than sixty thousand Germans came to America. Some ethnic Germans from the Duchy of Baden, Alsace (Elsass) and Switzerland also left Europe at French ports like Le Havre.

After taking the oath of allegiance to the English Crown, the Germans spread out into the area of southeastern Pennsylvania, looking for good land and places to make their new homes. They settled first in what are now Bucks, Montgomery, Chester, Lancaster, and Berks Counties. Today, Yoder is a common surname among the Amish and Mennonites.

<text>Lasse Braun (born Alberto Ferro; 11 January 1936 – 16 February 2015) was an Italian pornographer, film director, producer, screenwriter, novelist and researcher.

He initially produced so-called loops, ten-minute hardcore movies that he sold to Reuben Sturman, who distributed them to 60,000 American peep show booths. 

Braun is the father of Axel Braun.

==Life==
Braun was born into a wealthy, aristocratic Italian family as Alberto Ferro, and was destined to become a diplomat, following in his father&#x27;s footsteps. He passed all of his law exams at the State University of Milan (1956–63), and while preparing the defense of his doctoral dissertation entitled &quot;Judiciary Censorship in the Western World&quot;, its contents and underlying radical ideas provoked so much controversy that it was promptly dismissed.

A Member of Parliament from Denmark translated the thesis into Danish; and the translation laid the foundation for the legalisation of pornography in Denmark on 4 June 1969.

Braun placed himself firmly in the tradition of 18th century pornographers such as Rétif de la Bretonne, who was the first author to coin the word &quot;pornography&quot; in his plea for the institutionalisation of brothels in &quot;Le Pornographe&quot; (1769) and to describe a comprehensive range of sexual variations in &quot;L&#x27;Anti-Justine ou les Délices de l&#x27;Amour&quot; (1798).

Another source of inspiration for Braun consisted of the Priapistic rituals and orgiastic festivals of the Dionysus cult, as well as ceremonies in veneration of Aphrodite (Porne), the goddess of lust and patroness of courtesans. According to Braun, censorship itself is obscene, and the suppression of sexual desire by the political and religious establishment over the centuries has only led to psychological damage and frustration. 

In the early 1960s, Braun started to use his father&#x27;s &quot;Corps Diplomatique&quot; number-plates to smuggle pornographic magazine into Italy, first from Monaco and then from Brussels. In 1966 he began to shoot his own short pornographic films on 8mm and distributed them all over Europe. When the Italian authorities came after him, he moved to Sweden; he was eventually sentenced in absentia to 2.5 years in prison. Beginning in 1972, he sold his loops to Reuben Sturman in the USA.

In the early 1970s, Braun moved to the Netherlands and began to make several full-length pornographic films. Later, having withdrawn from the world of pornography, purportedly out of disappointment with the purely commercial approach of American distributors and the resulting inferiority of video productions, Braun dedicated himself to writing scientific works on sexology (&quot;L&#x27;impeto di Venere&quot;, dealing with the G-spot) and on anthropology, erotic historical novels, erotic thrillers, a study of prostitution, and his autobiography. 

In his 740-page novel &quot;Lady Caligula&quot;, Braun goes against the grain by portraying Caligula as a brilliant character, instead of the deranged emperor described in Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; and in I, Claudius.

Braun died from complications of diabetes on February 16, 2015 in Rome, Italy at the age of 78.

In 1972, Braun moved to the Dutch town of Breda, where he bought an old meat factory, which was renovated to serve as his headquarters. Using women he had become acquainted with in European bars and discothèques, Braun produced his longer movies starring the Brigitte Maier, Nathalie Morin and Catherine Ringer.

In the U.S., Sturman was prosecuted for obscenity over Braun&#x27;s 1972 movie &quot;Cake Orgy,&quot; but was acquitted. Three of Braun&#x27;s films, &quot;Penetration&quot; (1972), &quot;Sensations&quot; (1975) and &quot;Body Love&quot; (1977), (the latter featuring a soundtrack composed by Klaus Schulze) were shown during the Cannes film festival.

Braun&#x27;s movies differ markedly from the traditional so-called stag films made from 1916 onward, with storylines featuring Viking invasions, James Bond spoofs, and exotic locales such as Caribbean islands, the Dutch Groeneveld Castle, and an Amsterdam art gallery. 

After his &quot;French Blue&quot; had been shown at the Amsterdam cinema of &quot;City 2&quot; from June until December 1977, Braun was offered a five-year contract to extend its run along with &quot;Sensations&quot;, but the Catholic Minister of Justice Dries van Agt terminated the public showing of pornographic movies by reintroducing an 1880 Law concerning fire hazard at public theatres that happened to contain more than fifty seats. Disillusioned, Braun decamped to Italy, where he made a number of softporn movies. Facing several lawsuits on charges of obscenity, Braun countered by arguing that recording the licit act of consensual sex on film could not be condemned as illicit. His only known son, Axel Braun, continued the family trade in the United States of America, after obtaining a doctorate in Psychology.

In 1980, Braun&#x27;s former wife burnt his entire photo and movie archive out of fear for an impending police raid, but Braun managed to retrieve three major movies and thirty short films with the help of collectors, and re-mastered the collection on DVD. He appeared in the television series &quot;Pornography: A Secret History of Civilisation&quot; (1999) and in a documentary about himself, &quot;I, the King of Porn ... the Adventurous Life of Lasse Braun&quot; (2001).

In 1999, Braun became the first European movie director to have been inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame by Adult Video News. His son, Axel Braun, followed in his footsteps becoming the only other European movie director to have been inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame by Adult Video News in 2011. His grandson, Rikki Braun, made his directing debut in 2017 with the feature &quot;Exposed&quot;, which earned him seven AVN Award nominations including Best Director.

In 2019, Braun was awarded a posthumous AVN Best Screenplay Award for the movie &quot;The Possession of Mrs. Hyde&quot;, which he co-wrote with his son Axel Braun and his grandson, Rikki Braun. The movie took home a total of five AVN awards, including Movie of the Year.

<text>Aristide Massaccesi (15 December 1936 – 23 January 1999), known professionally as Joe D&#x27;Amato, was an Italian film director, producer, cinematographer, and screenwriter who worked in many genres (westerns, &quot;decamerotici&quot;, peplum, war films, swashbuckler, comedy, fantasy, postapocalyptic film, and erotic thriller) but is best known for his horror, erotic and adult films.

D&#x27;Amato worked in the 1950s as electric and set photographer, in the 1960s as camera operator, and from 1969 onwards as cinematographer. Starting in 1972, he directed and co-directed around 200 films under numerous pseudonyms, regularly acting as cinematographer as well. Starting in the early 1980s, D&#x27;Amato produced many of his own and other directors&#x27; genre films through the companies he founded or co-founded, the best known being Filmirage. From 1979 to 1982 and from 1993 to 1999, D&#x27;Amato also produced and directed about 120 adult films.

Among his best known erotic films are his five entries into the Black Emanuelle series of films starring Laura Gemser (1976–1978) and his horror/pornography crossover films &quot;Erotic Nights of the Living Dead&quot; and &quot;Porno Holocaust&quot; (both shot in Santo Domingo in 1979). In the horror genre, he is above all remembered for his films &quot;Beyond the Darkness&quot; (1979) and &quot;Antropophagus&quot; (1980), which have gained cult status, as well as &quot;Absurd&quot; (1981).

==Biography==
===Early life and work (1936–1969)===
Joe D&#x27;Amato was born on 15 December 1936 in Rome, Italy. His father was Renato Massaccesi, who after an incident on a ship had been declared a war invalid and had started to work at the Istituto Luce in Rome first as electrician, fixing power generators left by the United States army at Cinecittà, and then as chief photographic technician. In 1950, at the age of 14, D&#x27;Amato joined his father at work together with his brothers Carlo and Fernando (called Nando). Being the most enterprising of the three sons, D&#x27;Amato took on the task of delivering the movie cameras his father sold. D&#x27;Amato also assisted in the dubbing of Italian film productions and designed title and end credits with Eugenio Bava, cutting the letters out by hand. In 1952, D&#x27;Amato worked as a still photographer on the set of &quot;The Golden Coach&quot;, later as electric. In the 1960s, D&#x27;Amato eventually moved on to work as a camera operator on numerous films including Mario Bava&#x27;s &quot;Hercules in the Haunted World&quot;.

===First work as cinematographer and director (1969–1975)===
In 1969, Piero Livi&#x27;s &quot;Pelle di bandito&quot; and Silvio Amadio&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Island&quot; (Italian: &quot;L&#x27;Isola delle Svedesi&quot;) were D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s first films as cinematographer. In the next few years, D&#x27;Amato continued to work as cinematographer on Italian productions such as Umberto Lenzi&#x27;s &quot;A Quiet Place to Kill&quot;, Massimo Dallamano&#x27;s &quot;What Have You Done to Solange?&quot; and some of Demofilo Fidani&#x27;s low-budget Spaghetti Westerns.

D&#x27;Amato took on the role of director for the first time in 1972. He started out with a number of small western films (&quot;Go Away! Trinity Has Arrived in Eldorado&quot; and &quot;A Bounty Killer in Trinity&quot;) and decamerotici (&quot;More Sexy Canterbury Tales&quot; and &quot;Novelle licenziose di vergini vogliose&quot;) which he partly directed, partly co-directed before going on to direct the gothic horror film &quot;Death Smiles on a Murderer&quot; (1973) and the war film &quot;Heroes in Hell&quot; (1974), both starring Klaus Kinski. D&#x27;Amato briefly relinquished directing and reverted to cinematography in films such as Luigi Batzella&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Wedding Night&quot;, Steve Carver&#x27;s &quot;The Arena&quot; and five films directed by Alberto De Martino: &quot;Crime Boss&quot;, &quot;The Killer Is on the Phone&quot;, &quot;Counselor at Crime&quot;, &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, and – two years later – &quot;Strange Shadows in an Empty Room&quot;. When D&#x27;Amato was in Canada shooting a sleigh ride sequence for Lucio Fulci&#x27;s &quot;Challenge to White Fang&quot;, the film&#x27;s producer Ermanno Donati asked him to stay and direct the adventure film &quot;Red Coats&quot; for him, in which D&#x27;Amato used the pseudonym &quot;Joe D&#x27;Amato&quot; for the first time. It turned a good profit, and D&#x27;Amato later considered it his best film in this period.

===First films with Laura Gemser and the Black Emanuelle series (1975–1977)===
D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s next film &quot;Emanuelle&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1975), which he co-directed with Bruno Mattei (who remains uncredited because D&#x27;Amato was a &quot;rising name&quot;), was one of several films at the time whose titles alluded to the successful French erotic film &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; (1974). In retrospect, it was a kind of turning point in D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s career, being his first pornographic film – though still softcore.

In his next film, the commedia sexy &quot;Voto di castità&quot; (1976, scripted by George Eastman), D&#x27;Amato met Laura Gemser, who would star in many of his films and in the 1980s and early 1990s would also regularly work as costume designer for his productions. In this first film, she only played the small part of a French maid, but it was during the shoot that D&#x27;Amato got the idea to use her as star in his next film.

&quot;Eva nera&quot; was the exotic erotic drama which D&#x27;Amato directed starring Gemser as topless snake dancer alongside Jack Palance and Gabriele Tinti – her future husband. The film was produced by Harry Alan Towers and Lucio Fulcisano and shot both on location in Hong Kong and at the Elios Studios near Rome.

Gemser, who had previously starred in Bitto Albertini&#x27;s &quot;Black Emanuelle&quot; (1975), went on to shoot the following five films of the Black Emanuelle series under D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s direction. (Albertini, on the other hand, had to find a new actress for his own &quot;Black Emanuelle 2&quot; (1976) – a sequel only in name.) Although the main character&#x27;s name in the Black Emanuelle series alluded to the original French Emmanuelle, it was spelled slightly differently in order to avoid a plagiarism lawsuit. Also, the character itself is different: Black Emanuelle is an international reporter and photographer who travels to exotic locations. D&#x27;Amato added some violence and horror to the series such as the fake snuff film footage in &quot;Emanuelle in America&quot;, a gang rape scene in &quot;Emanuelle Around the World&quot; (1977), and gore scenes in the cannibal film &quot;Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals&quot;. As D&#x27;Amato later remembered, this &quot;was a very good period in my life. Movie business was very good. We travelled round the world, finding new and fascinating locations for our movies.&quot;

===The Caribbean phase (1978–1979)===
Of the 12 films D&#x27;Amato directed in 1978 and 1979, 9 were shot in the Dominican Republic. In a 1982 interview, he said that once the trip was paid for, the costs were low and the setting suggestive (&quot;the Caribbean... all for free&quot;; Italian: &quot;i Caraibi... tutto gratis&quot;).

The first time D&#x27;Amato went to Santo Domingo was in May 1978 for the erotic horror film &quot;Papaya, Love Goddess of the Cannibals&quot;. He returned there in September to shoot the mercenaries-at-war film &quot;Tough to Kill&quot;.

In mid-October 1978, back in Italy, D&#x27;Amato started shooting the nunsploitation film &quot;Images in a Convent&quot;, and in early 1979, which was to become a particularly productive year, he directed the violent erotic thriller &quot;Il porno shop della settima strada&quot; (&quot;The Pleasure Shop on Seventh Avenue&quot;) on location in New York, both films produced by Franco Gaudenzi&#x27;s company Kristal Film. From late June to early July 1979, D&#x27;Amato went to South Tyrol to shoot and direct the horror film &quot;Buio Omega&quot; starring Kieran Canter and Cinzia Monreale, a remake of Mino Guerrini&#x27;s &quot;The Third Eye&quot; produced by Dario Rossetti and Ermanno Donati with music by Goblin.

Immediately afterwards, D&#x27;Amato went back to Santo Domingo to film &quot;Paradiso blu&quot;, an Italian counterpart to &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; starring Anna Bergman and Lucia Ramirez, and the voodoo-themed &quot;Orgasmo nero&quot; (&quot;Sex and Black Magic&quot;) starring Ramirez, Susan Scott and Richard Harrison, before directing two films combining hardcore pornography and horror – &quot;Porno Holocaust&quot; and &quot;Le notti erotiche dei morti viventi&quot; (&quot;Erotic Nights of the Living Dead&quot;) – as well as three adult thrillers: &quot;Hard Sensation&quot;, &quot;Porno Esotic Love&quot; and &quot;Sesso Nero&quot;. For &quot;Porno Esotic Love&quot;, D&#x27;Amato reused material from &quot;Eva nera&quot; (1976), especially those scenes D&#x27;Amato had shot with Laura Gemser in Hong Kong. (&quot;Eva nera&quot; had done very poorly at the Italian box office and therefore was still relatively unknown.)

===First work as producer (1979–1982)===
The voodoo-themed &quot;Sesso nero&quot;, written by George Eastman, was the last film D&#x27;Amato shot in the Caribbean, at the end of 1979, and the first film D&#x27;Amato produced on his own, through his newly founded company, P.C.M. (Produzioni Cinematografiche Massaccesi). Of the Caribbean group of films it received the earliest theatrical release – the films only being released gradually throughout 1980 and 1981.

After his return from the Caribbean, D&#x27;Amato also co-founded Filmirage and used the companies to produce and direct the gore film &quot;Antropophagus&quot; (1980, produced through P.C.M. and Filmirage) and its follow-up, the slasher film &quot;Absurd&quot; (1981, co-produced by Filmirage and Metaxa), both of which starred George Eastman and later became cult films for fans of extreme cinema.

D&#x27;Amato also founded and co-founded two further production companies &quot;Cinema 80&quot; and &quot;M.A.D.&quot; (an acronym for [Aristide] Massaccesi, Alessandroni, and [Donatella] Donati) on 15 January 1980 and 9 January 1981, respectively. For M.A.D., Alessandroni, an engineer, provided the funding, while his son acted as producer on set. Donatella Donati, the daughter of Ermanno Donati, became D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s assistant and constant collaborator, usually acting as production secretary and assistant director.

The two companies were the main vehicles for D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s film production of this period. From 1980 until 1982, D&#x27;Amato produced 14 hardcore pornographic films through both companies (Cinema 80: 9 films, M.A.D.: 5), 10 of which he directed and lensed himself, while 3 of the films (&quot;Blue erotic climax&quot;, &quot;Labbra vogliose&quot; and &quot;Le porno investigatrici&quot;) were directed by Claudio Bernabei. Officially, Bernabei was both executive manager and director, his pseudonym Alexander (or Alexandre) Borsky being used for almost all directorial credits although the films were for the most part directed by D&#x27;Amato personally, who was only given credit in the non-committal phrase &quot;a Joe D&#x27;Amato film&quot; () used for marketing purposes. The reason for this lay in avoiding one of two criminal charges per film since the state only charged the executive manager of the company and the director; them being the same person, only one charge was brought forth. One notable exception was &quot;Porno video&quot; (1981; sometimes: &quot;Pornovideo&quot;), which was directed entirely by Giuliana Gamba (under the pseudonym Therese Dunn); it was the first film D&#x27;Amato produced for another director – a practice he would start expanding six years later in his Filmirage period. &quot;Il succo del sesso&quot; (1982; a punning title which can mean both &quot;The Essence of Sex&quot; and &quot;The Juice of Sex&quot;) was the only film of this period that was directed but not produced by D&#x27;Amato, being a &quot;Promo Film&quot; production of Giovanni Perrucci&#x27;s.

The average Cinema 80 or M.A.D. film cost 55 million lire, was shot in 10 days, edited over a period of two months, and had a generic title such as &quot;Super climax&quot;, &quot;Super hard love&quot; or &quot;Voglia di sesso&quot; (literally: &quot;Lust for Sex&quot;). A group of three films produced through Cinema 80 stands out. In 1981, building on Tinto Brass&#x27;s &quot;Caligula&quot; (1979), D&#x27;Amato produced, shot and directed &quot;Caligula... The Untold Story&quot; in both a hardcore and a softcore version, starring David Brandon, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. It recounted the final days of the Roman Emperor Caligula and was followed by two purely hardcore pornographic films – &quot;Una vergine per l&#x27;impero romano&quot; and &quot;Messalina orgasmo imperiale&quot; – in which D&#x27;Amato reused sets and costumes from the first film, albeit on a significantly lower budget. The three films were signed by D&#x27;Amato as director under different pseudonyms and released separately in December 1982, May 1983 and July 1983. They have been called his &quot;porno-peplum trilogy&quot;.

&quot;Messalina orgasmo imperiale&quot; (shot in 1982) also happened to be the last film of this period. Another hardcore film that D&#x27;Amato originally intended to shoot himself for producer Riccardo Billy in co-production with a Chinese company, &quot;Love in Hong Kong&quot; (1983, starring Mark Shannon and Marianne Aubert), ended up being entirely delegated to his assistant Bernabei for lack of time, who directed the film on location in Hong Kong. It survives only in a truncated softcore version.

===The Filmirage years (1982–1993)===
In 1980, D&#x27;Amato had taken over a company from producer Ermanno Donati. D&#x27;Amato had renamed the company to &quot;Filmirage&quot; and used it to produce his own and, from 1987 onwards, also other directors&#x27; films for the international market.

In 1982, D&#x27;Amato used Filmirage to produce, shoot and direct the first film of the Ator series: &quot;Ator l&#x27;invincibile&quot; (&quot;Ator, the Fighting Eagle&quot;) starring Miles O&#x27;Keeffe and Sabrina Siani, which was directly inspired by &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Ator 2 - L&#x27;invincibile Orion&quot; (English titles: &quot;The Blade Master&quot; and &quot;Cave Dwellers&quot;) the following year, in which O&#x27;Keefe was flanked by Lisa Foster.

In 1983 and 1984, D&#x27;Amato produced and shot the post-apocalyptic action films &quot;Endgame&quot; (1983) starring Al Cliver, George Eastman, Laura Gemser and Gordon Mitchell, which D&#x27;Amato directed alone, and &quot;2020 Texas Gladiators&quot; (1984) starring Al Cliver and Sabrina Siani, which D&#x27;Amato co-directed with George Eastman. The films follow the success of &quot;Mad Max&quot; (1979) and &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (1981).

In 1984 and early 1985, D&#x27;Amato briefly reactivated his company M.A.D. to produce 10 hardcore pornographic films, all of which were directed by Luca Damiano and starred Marina Hedman. D&#x27;Amato is reported to have collaborated on some of these himself as well, although it remains speculative in which function and on which ones. Later in 1985 D&#x27;Amato left hardcore pornography behind and for a period of eight years exclusively shot softcore and horror films. According to an interview D&#x27;Amato gave in 1990, hardcore, as opposed to softcore, had only been profitable the first four years in the late 1970s and early 1980s while the novelty and controversy lasted.

D&#x27;Amato began this hardcore-free period by directing four softcore dramas set during fascism in Italy and starring Lilli Carati and Laura Gemser: &quot;L&#x27;alcova&quot; (&quot;The Alcove&quot;), &quot;Il piacere&quot; (&quot;The Pleasure&quot;), &quot;Lussuria&quot; (&quot;A Lustful Mind&quot;), and &quot;Voglia di guardare&quot; (&quot;Midnight Gigolo&quot;). The four films recall the style and themes of Tinto Brass&#x27;s &quot;La chiave&quot; (&quot;The Key&quot;) while their plots and characters are not interconnected in any way.

Together with Harry Alan Towers, D&#x27;Amato co-produced &quot;Warrior Queen&quot; (working title: &quot;Pompeii&quot;), shot in 1985 at the Elios Studios near Rome to cash in on the success of the miniseries &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1984). It was a sword-and-sandal film starring Sybil Danning, Donald Pleasence and David Brandon and was directed by Chuck Vincent. In an interview, Larry Revene, Vincent&#x27;s usual cinematographer, remembered that he worked on the sync sound for this film instead, because &quot;Aristide shot it. He wasn&#x27;t only a director/producer, he was also a cameraman.&quot; In the United States, the film had a brief theatrical run in a cut R rated version before being released in a longer version on video.

There followed a phase in which D&#x27;Amato directed softcore films predominantly in the United States, often takes on popular American films. First, he went to New Orleans to produce and shoot two films starring Jessica Moore as the novelist Sarah Asproon: &quot;11 Days, 11 Nights&quot; (1987) and &quot;Top Model&quot; (1988). &quot;11 Days, 11 Nights&quot; was inspired by Adrian Lyne&#x27;s film &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; but reversed the roles with the woman being the dissolute character; it was a commercial success. In 1989, D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s main actress was Valentine Demy with whom he produced and directed &quot;Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Dirty Love&quot;, the latter reminiscent of another of Adrian Lyne&#x27;s films, &quot;Flashdance&quot;. After these, D&#x27;Amato produced and directed two erotic dramas with Tara Buckman: &quot;Blue Angel Cafe&quot; and &quot;High Finance Woman&quot;.

Beyond producing his own softcore films, D&#x27;Amato also used Filmirage to produce other directors&#x27; films: Michele Soavi&#x27;s debut &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (which was also the debut of D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s son Daniele Massaccesi as assistant cameraman), Deran Serafian&#x27;s &quot;Interzone&quot;, Umberto Lenzi&#x27;s &quot;Ghosthouse&quot; (&quot;La casa 3&quot;) and &quot;Hitcher In The Dark&quot;, Fabrizio Laurenti&#x27;s &quot;Witchery&quot; (&quot;La casa 4&quot;) and &quot;The Crawlers&quot; (&quot;Troll 3&quot;), George Eastman&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, Claudio Fragasso&#x27;s &quot;Troll 2&quot; and &quot;Beyond Darkness&quot; (&quot;La casa 5&quot;), Franco Molé&#x27;s &quot;The Room of Words&quot;, and Lucio Fulci&#x27;s &quot;Door to Silence&quot;. D&#x27;Amato not only produced, but also partially directed the horror film &quot;Killing Birds&quot; and but for the first scene directed the sharksploitation drama &quot;Deep Blood&quot;.

At the beginning of the 1990s, D&#x27;Amato revisited his &quot;Ator&quot; series with a concluding entry entitled &quot;Quest for the Mighty Sword&quot;, featuring the Son of Ator. Then, he revived the character of Sarah Asproon in &quot;11 Days, 11 Nights 2&quot;, this time played by Kristine Rose and again set in New Orleans. With Rose as protagonist, D&#x27;Amato also directed &quot;Passion&#x27;s Flower&quot;, a remake of &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, before shooting two softcore films starring Carmen di Pietro in 1991, both with a more violent angle than the preceding ones: &quot;Devil in the Flesh&quot; follows a group of mercenaries who encounter some nurses at an isolated hospital, and &quot;Dangerous Obsession&quot; tells of a woman who turns the tables on her assailant. After these, D&#x27;Amato directed &quot;Return from Death (Frankenstein 2000)&quot; (1992), his last horror film, which combined a modern take on the traditional &quot;Frankenstein&quot; story with elements of the rape and revenge film.

In 1993, inspired by the success of the Chinese erotic comedy &quot;Sex and Zen&quot; (1991), D&#x27;Amato then went to the Philippines to shoot a number of Asian themed softcore films, for which he often used Chinese pseudonyms. Among them are such diverse films as &quot;Chinese Kamasutra&quot;, &quot;China and Sex&quot; and &quot;I racconti della camera rossa&quot; (translation: &quot;The Tales of the Red Chamber&quot;; named after China&#x27;s classical novel &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;), the latter two structurally and thematically reminiscent of Italian decamerotici.

===Later work and death (1993–1999)===

Later in 1993, D&#x27;Amato went back to predominantly producing and directing hardcore pornography.
 In order to return to adult filmmaking more easily, D&#x27;Amato initially teamed up with Luca Damiano, with whom he shot roughly 20 films before continuing on his own. Although video had become the standard for adult films, D&#x27;Amato continued to shoot on 35mm film for a few years before finally transitioning to video for his last productions in 1997 and 1998 – a development which he saw critically: When shooting on video, there was little difference between the individual films in terms of profit, which helped minimise production risk, but the overall profit and hence the quality of the individual productions that were shot on video were lower compared to productions shot on film. The crew on an early 35mm shoot such as &quot;Juliet &amp; Romeo&quot; had been much larger, including lighting staff, camera assistants, make-up artists, and set decorators; dubbing was done in post-production.

Among D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s best known films from this late hardcore period are his collaborations with Rocco Siffredi (&quot;Tarzan X – Shame of Jane&quot;, &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, &quot;Marquis de Sade&quot;, &quot;Torero&quot;) and Kelly Trump (&quot;Messalina&quot;, &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, &quot;Lolita&quot;), his pornographic versions of Shakespearean drama (&quot;Juliet &amp; Romeo&quot;, &quot;Anthony and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Othello 2000&quot;), westerns (&quot;Outlaws&quot;, &quot;Calamity Jane&quot;), swashbucklers (&quot;Raiders&quot;), the Bible (&quot;Sodom &amp; Gamorra&quot;), Greco-Roman mythology (&quot;Olympus&quot;, &quot;Amor &amp; Psyche&quot;, &quot;Ulysses&quot;, &quot;Hercules – A Sex Adventure&quot;), Roman emperors (&quot;Nero – Orgy of Fire&quot;, &quot;Caligula – The Deviant Emperor&quot;) and other famous people (&quot;Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Goya&quot;, &quot;Amadeus Mozart&quot;, &quot;Thief of Love – Giacomo Casanova&quot;, &quot;Rudy – Valentino&#x27;s story&quot;, &quot;Scarface&quot;). Two recurring actresses in his films from 1996 to 1999 were Selen (&quot;Raw &amp; Naked&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Elephants&quot;, &quot;Sahara&quot;, and &quot;Selen the Girl from Treasure Island&quot;) and Éva Henger, with whom he shot the time travel films &quot;Experiences&quot; and &quot;Experiences 2&quot;, a trilogy on the capital sins, &quot;Phantom&quot; (using footage from the silent film &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;), and &quot;Showgirl&quot;. Whereas D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s adult films were very rarely without a plot entirely, D&#x27;Amato stated in a 1997 interview that one had used to include more plot whereas now the only thing they wanted was porn – and very hard one at that: &quot;double, triple, quadruple penetrations, anal ...&quot;.

In between shooting adult films from 1994 to 1999, D&#x27;Amato also made efforts at returning to genre films, four of which came to fruition. In 1995, he directed the erotic drama &quot;Provocation&quot; set in the Italian countryside of the 1930s starring Erika Savastani, and in 1997 the erotic comedy &quot;Top Girl&quot; set in and around an American TV station and the erotic thriller &quot;The Hyena&quot; starring Cinzia Roccaforte, which received a limited theatrical release in Italy. In 1998, D&#x27;Amato directed the swashbuckler &quot;I predatori delle Antille&quot; (aka &quot;Sexy Pirates&quot;), starring Anita Rinaldi.

On 23 January 1999, Joe D&#x27;Amato died of a heart attack in Monterotondo, a &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital. According to Luigi Cozzi, his death happened unexpectedly while he was busy preparing a new film. His last film was the adult film &quot;Showgirl&quot; (1999), a take on Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Showgirls&quot; (1995).

==Names under which D&#x27;Amato is credited==
===Birthname===
Throughout his career, D&#x27;Amato used his birthname Aristide Massaccesi only once for a directorial credit, namely for &quot;Death Smiles on a Murderer&quot; (1973). However, it was regularly used for other credits. For his first work as camera operator, it was the only name he was credited with, and as cinematographer, writer of stories and scriptwriter, he credited himself or was credited with it regularly until the early 1980s.

===Pseudonyms===
The first pseudonyms used by Aristide Massaccesi were his actor&#x27;s credits in the Spaghetti Westerns &quot;Straniero... fatti il segno della croce!&quot; (1968) and &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Make Shadows&quot; (1970), for which he used puns on his birthname: Ariston Massachusetts and Arizona , respectively.

His best known pseudonym is the anglicized Joe D&#x27;Amato, which he first adopted as director of &quot;Giubbe Rosse&quot; (1975). In 1991, D&#x27;Amato stated he had discovered the name in some calendar and chosen to use it because it sounded promising: in its mixture of American and Italian, it was similar to those of Brian de Palma and Martin Scorsese. Joe D&#x27;Amato became the name Massaccesi was most associated with, even more than his birth name. D&#x27;Amato used this main pseudonym of his exclusively for credits as producer and director and not for credits as cinematographer or writer.

The pseudonym Federiko Slonisko, sometimes also spelled Federico Slonisco or any mixture of these two spellings (including the short form Fred and several other mis- or variant spellings), was regularly used for D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s work as cinematographer starting in 1982.

The pseudonyms Federico Slonisco Jr. and Dan Slonisko (including variant spellings) are also sometimes considered to belong to D&#x27;Amato. However, D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s son Daniele, a camera operator and cinematographer, started his career working for his father.

The pseudonym Michael Wotruba was used as D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s directorial credit on:
* &quot;Novelle licenziose di vergini vogliose&quot; (1973) – also screenplay
* &quot;Pugni, pirati e karatè&quot; (1973)
* &quot;Diario di una vergine romana&quot; (1973)
* &quot;Heroes in Hell&quot; (1974) – also screenplay
* &quot;The Arena&quot; (1974) – Italian version: director; international version: second unit director
This pseudonym is also to be found as directorial credit for &quot;Death Smiles on a Murderer&quot; (1973) in the entry at Public Cinematographic Register, but was later changed to D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s birthname for the release.

David Hills was used by D&#x27;Amato as directorial pseudonym on the following films:
* &quot;Caligula... The Untold Story&quot; (1981) – also screenplay
* &quot;Ator, the Fighting Eagle&quot; (1982)
* &quot;Ator 2 - L&#x27;invincibile Orion&quot; (1983)
* &quot;Quest for the Mighty Sword&quot; (1990)
* &quot;Frankenstein 2000&quot; (1991)
* &quot;I predatori delle Antille&quot; (1998)
David Hills was also used as directorial credit on an early announcement of &quot;Deep Blood&quot; (1989), but was exchanged by the allonym Raf Donato for the official release. 
As producer, D&#x27;Amato used this pseudonym on &quot;Troll 2&quot; and &quot;Interzone&quot;.

For the last two films of D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s &quot;porno-peplum trilogy&quot;, &quot;Una vergine per l&#x27;impero&quot; and &quot;Messalina orgasmo imperiale&quot; (both released 1983), D&#x27;Amato used Dirk Frey as cinematographer and Robert Hall and O.J. Clarke as director, respectively.

The directorial credit of &quot;Il succo del sesso&quot; (1983), which D&#x27;Amato directed, reads Gilbert Damiano - an allusion to Gerard Damiano.

The pseudonym Peter Newton was used for D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s credit as cinematographer on &quot;Paradiso blu&quot; (1980) and his directorial credit on &quot;Absurd&quot; (1981). For the latter, he also used Richard Haller for his credits as cinematographer and co-producer. Kevin Mancuso was used for the directorial credit on &quot;2020 Texas Gladiators&quot; (1982); D&#x27;Amato co-directed the film with George Eastman so it can be considered a pseudonym for both Eastman and D&#x27;Amato. D&#x27;Amato used the name Dario Donati as director and editor on &quot;Convent of Sinners&quot; (1986) and as director on &quot;Delizia&quot; (1986).

The female pseudonym Joan Russell was used for D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s directorial credit on &quot;Una tenera storia&quot; (1992). It was also used not for D&#x27;Amato, but for Donatella Donati and Antonio Tentori as story and screenwriting credit in &quot;Frankenstein 2000&quot; (1992), which D&#x27;Amato produced and directed.

For his oriental films of 1993, D&#x27;Amato used a number of new pseudo-oriental pseudonyms. For &quot;I racconti della camera rossa&quot; he used Robert Yip as director, Lim Seng Yee as scenarist and Boy Tan Bien as cinematographer. For &quot;Chinese kamasutra&quot; he signed with the pseudonyms Chang Lee Sun (director), Fu Shen (scenarist) and Hsu Hsien (cinematographer). And for &quot;Il labirinto dei sensi&quot;, he signed his scenario with Leslie Wong while using Joe D&#x27;Amato and Federico Slonsiko for the directorial and cinematographic credits respectively.

===Allonyms===
An allonym is distinguished from a pseudonym in that it is the given name or pseudonym of a &quot;different person&quot; from the one who should be credited.

Romano Gastaldi, the pseudonym of Romano Scandariato, was used for the directorial credit on &quot;More Sexy Canterbury Tales&quot; (1972), which D&#x27;Amato directed while Scandariato was his assistant director, and for &quot;Fra&#x27; Tazio da Velletri&quot; (1973), which D&#x27;Amato left after a disagreement soon after the beginning of the shoot; Scandariato, his assistant, finished the film and was credited.

Oskar Faradine, the pseudonym of Oscar Santaniello, was used for the directorial credit on &quot;A Bounty Killer in Trinity&quot;. The film was reportedly directed by D&#x27;Amato and Santaniello was the film&#x27;s producer. Lupi, however, in his monograph on D&#x27;Amato argues on qualitative grounds for Santaniello as actual director.

Anna Bergman″s name was also used for the directorial credit on &quot;Paradiso blu&quot; (1980). Bergman was the main actress, but D&#x27;Amato directed the film. Her name was used for the directorial credit because, according to Luigi Cozzi, the producer did not want it to be seen as an erotic film (for which D&#x27;Amato was already known at the time).

Alexandre Borsky, sometimes spelled Alexander or Borski, was the pseudonym of Claudio Bernabei. Bernabei stated in an interview that he created it with Walerian Borowczyk&#x27;s name in mind. The Borsky pseudonym was used as directorial credit for 14 of the 15 films produced by D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s companies M.A.D. and Cinema 80 from 1980 to 1982. Of these 14 films, Bernabei directed 3, D&#x27;Amato 11. In 1993 and 1994, D&#x27;Amato briefly reactivated this name as directorial credit for a small number of adult films starring Luana Borgia which he directed while transitioning from softcore to hardcore again. According to an interview he gave in 1995, it was to camouflage his return.

Lucky Faar (or Farr) Delly, sometimes wrongly listed as a pseudonym of Joe D&#x27;Amato, was in reality the pseudonym of Luciano Fardelli, who acted as administrator of D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s production company M.A.D. in 1984 and 1985. It was used as directorial credit for 10 films directed by Franco Lo Cascio; it is unclear in which of these films D&#x27;Amato acted as co-director.

Raf Donato, a variant of Raffaele Donato&#x27;s name, was used for the directorial credit on &quot;Deep Blood&quot; (1989). According to D&#x27;Amato, Donato had planned to direct the film, but only directed the first scene. D&#x27;Amato directed the rest of the film.

==Personality==
According to the actresses who worked with him, D&#x27;Amato was sociable, humorous with a sense of irony, amiable, and supportive; to some he appeared like a father. Both Laura Gemser, with whom he worked together for a long time, and Monica Zanchi pointed out his adventurous and playful approach to filmmaking.

Gemser also remembered that D&#x27;Amato rarely got angry, and that when it happened he usually took it with irony; when deeply angered, however, he would shout and curse and become insufferable. She also recalled that, much like herself, D&#x27;Amato fell asleep easily and anywhere, even in the breaks between rehearsals. Donatella Donati, his regular assistant since the mid-1970s, recalled this penchant as his biggest flaw; in Cannes, she once found him asleep on the office floor.

==Legacy==
===Screenings===
In 1995, Joe D&#x27;Amato was a special guest at the London film festival &quot;Eurofest&quot; which took place at the Everyman Cinema, Hampstead, where he gave an onstage interview to Mark Ashworth inbetween screenings of &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, &quot;Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein 2000&quot;, followed by a signing session. Parts of the interview can be found on the Severin DVD release of &quot;Emanuelle in Bangkok&quot;.

Posthumously, on 14 April 2006, the Cinémathèque Française in Paris screened a D&#x27;Amato double feature from newly acquired theatrical prints under the title &quot;Le sang et la chair&quot; (translation: The Blood and the Flesh), consisting of &quot;Antropophagus&quot; and &quot;Le sexe noir&quot; (both 1980).

The &quot;Joe D&#x27;Amato Horror Festival&quot;, under the art direction of Paolo Ruffini, was held for the first time in Pietrasanta in April 2007. It took place a second time in October and November 2014 in Livorno, moderated by Antonio Tentori. Among the guests was D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s son Daniele Massaccesi, who said that it had been above all the passion for cinema – to never stop making films at any costs – that D&#x27;Amato had wanted to pass on to the younger generation of filmmakers.

The &quot;Hofbauer Kongress&quot;, which takes place at least once every year since 2010 at the Komm Kino in Nuremberg, Germany, has repeatedly screened D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s films mostly from 35 mm prints, with the 15th and 16th edition of the festival being especially devoted to the filmmaker.

On 1–3 February 2019, honoring the 20th anniversary of D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s death, the Filmarchiv Austria held a &quot;Tribute to Joe D&#x27;Amato&quot; at the Metro Kinokulturhaus in Vienna in which 10 films he directed were shown from original 35 mm prints.

===Film tributes and dedications===

In 1999, Andreas Schnaas shot a remake of, and homage to, D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s &quot;Antropophagus&quot; entitled &quot;Anthropophagous 2000&quot;.

The Italian film &quot;Hyde&#x27;s Secret Nightmare&quot; (2011, directed by Domiziano Cristopharo) is dedicated to D&#x27;Amato.

== Filmography==
==Notes==

* a Both D&#x27;Amato and Diego Spataro, who used the alias &quot;Dick Spitfire&quot;, stated that D&#x27;Amato directed this film.
* b The credited director of &quot;Troll 2&quot; was Claudio Fragasso under the pseudonym &quot;Drake Floyd&quot;.
* c In his book on Italian horror directors, Louis Paul makes the unsourced statement that D&#x27;Amato &quot;ended up finishing [&quot;Troll 2&quot; and &quot;Troll 3&quot;] as director in an attempt to save the productions that even he deemed poorly filmed and unreleasable&quot;. Regarding &quot;Troll 3&quot;, Lupi also states that D&#x27;Amato directed a part of it. For &quot;Troll 2&quot;, Paul seems to be the only source for D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s directorial involvement.
* d The film&#x27;s main director was Fabrizio Laurenti under the pseudonym &quot;Martin Newlin&quot;.
* e The directorial credit of &quot;Top Girl&quot; varies. In Italian prints, it is credited to &quot;Andrea Massai&quot;; abroad, the credits read &quot;Joe D&#x27;Amato&quot;.
* f The credits of &quot;Bounty Killer in Trinity&quot; list Oscar Santaniello as director under his pseudonym &quot;Oskar Faradine&quot;. According to D&#x27;Amato himself, he directed the film, but let production manager Santaniello take the credit. Bruckner lists Santaniello as producer and D&#x27;Amato as director, and Curti, too, states that the film was &quot;directed by Massaccesi but signed by Santaniello – one of several unsigned directing jobs Massaccesi took on before his official first feature&quot;. Lupi, however, considers the movie to be of inferior quality and hence believes that Santaniello was truly the director whereas D&#x27;Amato, in his eyes, was only involved as cinematographer and writer.
* g &quot;More Sexy Canterbury Tales&quot; was directed by D&#x27;Amato, but the directorial credit went to assistant director Romano Scandariato under his pseudonym &quot;Romano Gastaldi&quot;; the English film credits &quot;Ralph Zucker&quot; as the director.
* h According to an interview given to the Italian magazine &quot;Nocturno&quot; by Romano Scandariato, who took the directorial credit under his pseudonym &quot;Romano Gastaldi&quot;, D&#x27;Amato directed about one third of &quot;Fra&#x27; Tazio da Velletri&quot; before leaving production due to differences with the producers; Scandariato then finished directing the remaining two thirds.
* i As director of &quot;Mondo Erotico&quot;, only Bruno Mattei was credited; the pseudonym &quot;Jimmy Matheus&quot; was used. D&#x27;Amato directed the scenes with Laura Gemser that tie the vignettes together; he remained uncredited.
* j Both Enrico Biribicchi, who got the credit, and D&#x27;Amato claimed that they had acted as cinematographers on set.
* k These 10 films, the so-called &quot;Lucky Faar Delly&quot; series (shot from April 1984 to February 1985), were all produced by D&#x27;Amato through his M.A.D. production company, were all directed by Luca Damiano, and all starred Marina Hedman. D&#x27;Amato occasionally contributed to the series as co-director, although the extent to which he did remains unclear. In &quot;Sesso allo specchio&quot;, film critic R. D&#x27;Amato observes the use of hand-held camera, which is otherwise not present in the Faar Delly series, as sign of D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s possible involvement.
* l Smith lists &quot;La chiave del piacere&quot; as an alternate title to &quot;Wendee, la chiave del piacere&quot; and states that &quot;according to some sources Massaccesi is the screenwriter&quot;.

<doc id="653699" wikidata="Q5600608" url="?curid=653699" title="1967 Greater London Council election">
<text>The second election to the [[Greater London Council]] was held on 13 April 1967, and saw the first Conservative victory for a London-wide authority since 1931.

==Electoral arrangements==
New constituencies to be used for elections to Parliament and also for elections to the GLC had not yet been settled, so the London boroughs were used as multi-member &#x27;first past the post&#x27; electoral areas. Westminster was joined with the City of London for this purpose. Each electoral area returned between 2 and 4 councillors.

==Results==
===General election of councillors===
The Conservative Party won a majority of seats at the election.

With an electorate of 5,319,023 and 2,187,789 persons voting, there was a turnout of 41.1%.

Among those defeated in the election were the Labour leader, Bill Fiske in Havering by a Conservative team that included Jeffrey Archer, who was making his entrance into politics, and Peggy Jay in Wandsworth. Other notable politicians who had their first success at this election include Harvey Hinds (Labour, Southwark, later Chief Whip for Ken Livingstone) and Christopher Bland (Conservative, Lewisham, later Chairman of the BBC).

===Aldermanic election===
In addition to the 100 elected councillors, there were sixteen aldermen on the council. Eight aldermen elected in 1964 continued to serve until 1970 and the other eight retired before the 1967 election. Eight aldermen were elected by the council on 2 May 1967 to serve until 1973.

Aldermen elected in 1967, to retire in 1973:

The aldermen divided 10 Conservative and 6 Labour, so that the Conservatives had a total 92 members to 24 for Labour following the aldermanic election.

==By-elections 1967–1970==

One of the successful Conservative candidates, Sheila Bradley (Greenwich), was a school nurse for the Inner London Education Authority. It was discovered that this was a disqualifying office, as she was in effect an employee of the GLC (as ILEA was technically a committee of the GLC); she resigned on 24 May prior to the hearing of an election petition. At a by-election on 29 June, Labour gained the seat. There were two further by-elections during the term: on 7 November 1968 the Conservatives held a seat in Bromley after the death of a councillor, and on 12 December of the same year the Conservatives held a seat in Havering after one of their councillors resigned. There were two seats vacant by the end of the term. A Conservative councillor for Harrow died on 8 June 1969, and on 8 January 1970 a Conservative councillor for Hammersmith was disqualified after failing to attend a meeting of the GLC or its committees for six months.

There were two aldermanic by-elections caused by the resignation of Nelly Margaret Walton (Conservative) in 1968 and the death of Timothy James Bligh (Conservative) in 1969. Richard Maddock Brew (Conservative) was elected by the council on 8 October 1968, to serve until 1973. Maurice Stephenson (Conservative) was elected by the council on 29 April 1969, to serve until 1973.

<doc id="653706" wikidata="Q579712" url="?curid=653706" title="Jean Rollin">
<text>Jean Michel Rollin Roth Le Gentil (3 November 1938 – 15 December 2010) was a French film director, actor, and novelist best known for his work in the fantastique genre.

Rollin&#x27;s career, spanning over fifty years, featured early short films and his achievements with his first four vampire classics &quot;Le viol du vampire&quot; (1968), &quot;La vampire nue&quot; (1970), &quot;Le frisson des vampires&quot; (1970), and &quot;Requiem pour un vampire&quot; (1971). Rollin&#x27;s subsequent notable works include &quot;La rose de fer&quot; (1973), &quot;Lèvres de sang&quot; (1975), &quot;Les raisins de la mort&quot; (1978), &quot;Fascination&quot; (1979), and &quot;La morte vivante&quot; (1982).

His films are noted for their exquisite, if mostly static, cinematography, off-kilter plot progression, poetic dialogue, playful surrealism and recurrent use of well-constructed female lead characters. Outlandish dénouements and abstruse visual symbols were trademarks. Belied by high production values and precise craftsmanship, his films were made with little money, often against deadlines. In the mid-1970s, lack of regular work led the director to direct mostly pornographic films under various pseudonyms, an activity he continued until the early 1980s.

==Early life==
Jean Rollin was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine (now Hauts-de-Seine), France, to Claude Louis René Rollin-Roth-Le Gentil, an actor and theatre director who went by the stage name Claude Martin, and his wife Denise (née Leffroi), an artists&#x27; model. His half-brother was actor Olivier Rollin.

==Career==

Rollin had a passion for cinema from an early age. He saw his first film during the second World War. It was &quot;Capitaine Fracasse&quot;, a 1942 film directed by Abel Gance. Rollin decided he wanted to make films when he grew up; his father, a theatre actor, was a heavy influence on him. During his teens, he developed an obsession for American serials and read comic books.

When he was 16, he found a job at &quot;Les Films de Saturne&quot;, helping write invoices while earning some money though he wanted to be involved in cinema. They specialized in creating opening and closing credits and short cartoons, but real films were also shot such as industrial shorts and documentaries. Rollin was part of the crew in a short documentary about &quot;Snecma&quot;, a big factory in France which built motors and planes. He arranged the tracking shots, laid the tracks, checked the electricity, and helped the cameraman.

When Rollin did his military service for the French army, he worked as an editor in the cinema department alongside Claude Lelouch. They worked on army commercials with Lelouch directing and Rollin editing. They also made two films, &quot;Mechanographie&quot;, a documentary, and &quot;La Guerre de Silence&quot; (&quot;The War of Silence&quot;), a real film with actors and a story.

In 1958 after leaving the army, he directed his first short film &quot;Les Amours Jaunes&quot; (&quot;The Yellow Lovers&quot;). He shot it on a 35mm Maurigraphe camera, and used a beach in Dieppe as his location, the same beach used in his later films.

===1960s===
In 1960, Rollin decided to direct his first feature film, but later abandoned the project as he had no money to finish it. His next short, &quot;Ciel de Cuivre&quot; (&quot;Sky of Copper&quot;), was directed in 1961, and was quite surreal though it told a sentimental story. He did not finish the film because he ran out of money and it was not very good. The footage is now lost.

In 1962, he was as an assistant director on the film &quot;Un Cheval pour Deux&quot; (&quot;A Horse for Two&quot;), which was not a great experience for him, and he decided to approach cinema in a different way. In the early sixties, Rollin became interested in politics and made a short documentary in 1964 called &quot;Vivre en Espagne&quot; (&quot;Life in Spain&quot;). It was about Generalissimo Francisco Franco, thirty minutes were filmed but he risked a lot to get it made. Rollin and the crew found themselves pursued by the police and just managed to make it back into France. Jean also directed a short film in 1965 called &quot;Les Pays Loins&quot;.
In 1968, Jean directed his first feature &quot;Le viol du vampire&quot; (&quot;The Rape of the Vampire&quot;). At the time he was still not known in the world of cinema, having only done a few short films and documentaries. The film was shot on a low budget, and consisted of two parts because it was originally intended to be another short film; the second part was later added so that it was released as a feature film. The release of &quot;Le Viol&quot; caused public scandal and outrage, his strong inspiration of American serials did not attract viewers. It was released during the events of May 1968, and due to the riots, it was a rare theatrical production at the time. Rollin himself was also threatened due to this scandal, because of this, he briefly decided to give up making films.

His second feature &quot;La vampire nue&quot; (&quot;The Nude Vampire&quot;) was his first film in colour. It was mostly inspired by the 1916 film &quot;Judex&quot;, and also surrealism in general. Rollin wanted to do something a little more temperate than &quot;Le Viol&quot;, a traditional mystery film. Anyway, as he himself stated, it came to be the same kind of film as his first feature, it also has the same spirit. &quot;La vampire nue&quot; also became notable in that it introduced Catherine and Marie-Pierre Castel, twin sisters who frequently collaborated with Rollin during the early years of his career.

Following &quot;La vampire nue&quot;, Rollin found himself in a financial crisis and having suffered an accident during production which left him traumatized, the circumstances took a positive turn when he met with producer Monique Nathan, owner of the Films Moderns company. Nathan having put her faith and support in Rollin, turned down several a number of the most prominent French New Wave filmmakers for financing and instead entirely supported Rollin as both a producer and a co-screenwriter for his next project, &quot;Le Frisson des Vampires&quot; (&quot;Shiver of the Vampires&quot;) which was heavily influenced by the trappings of the hippie movement. It did however retain many of the themes one could expect from a Rollin film and one of the most iconic scenes ever to appear in a Rollin film: actress Dominique emerging from an old grandfather clock. Production for the film took place in an abandoned castle in Soissons, a commune in the Aisne department of Picardy.

===1970s===
1971, Rollin directed &quot;Requiem pour un vampire&quot; (&quot;Requiem for a Vampire&quot;), which became one of his most successful films, and it was another low budget production, which almost took no money to produce. There was no dialogue in the first forty minutes of the film, this was in Rollin&#x27;s words to make the &quot;ultimate naive film&quot;, simplifying the story, direction and cinematography. Initially, Rollin had Catherine Castel in mind to play one of the leading ladies in &quot;Requiem&quot;; however, Castel was unable to accept the role due to being pregnant, which forced Rolling to offer the role to Maire-Pierre. The second female lead was portrayed by Mireille D&#x27;argent whom Rollin chose after she was introduced to him by an agent. Rollin discovered that D&#x27;argent&#x27;s agent was collecting her wages, which prompted him to contact a lawyer and have her wages returned to her. &quot;Requiem&quot; was filmed in the small village of Crêvecoeur. The graveyard was located outside the village on a knoll. The castle, a historical place entirely furnished with genuine antiques, all of which were worth a fortune, had been rented from the duchess of Roche-Guyon. It wasn&#x27;t her castle that Rollin and the crew were interested in, but the ruins of the dungeon above, that overlooked the entire area. Following this, Rollin made a temporary departure to creating films associated with the erotic vampire genre.

Having risen to success during his early vampire era, Rollin embarked on a different approach to filmmaking. Rollin financed his 1973 film &quot;La rose de fer&quot; (&quot;The Iron Rose&quot;) himself and was convinced that it would become a failure, leading to financial ruin. Prior to production, he engaged in a deal with Impex films to direct a number of hardcore porn films in the near future in order to produce &quot;La rose de fer&quot; and ensure that it would not fail. The story follows two young lovers (Françoise Pascal and Hugues Quester) who meet at a wedding reception and agree to go on a date, for which they decide to take a walk in an enormous cemetery. As they make love in an underground tomb, strange and bizarre occurrences take place above ground. As night falls, they frantically try to escape from the cemetery, and with no luck, end up where they started. They are slowly overcome with hysteria and paranoia which brings about their mortality. The film was shot in the city of Amiens over a four-week period and premiered at the 2nd Annual Convention of the Fantastique in Paris in April 1973 and was initially met with a negative reception and as a result, Rollin was unable to find anyone to back his future personal projects.

Rollin directed the adult sex films &quot;Jeunes filles impudiques&quot; (&quot;Schoolgirl Hitchhikers&quot;), &quot;Le sourire vertical&quot; (&quot;The Vertical Smile&quot;), and &quot;Tout le monde il en a deux&quot; (&quot;Bacchanales sexuelles&quot; or &quot;Fly Me the French Way&quot;) under the pseudonym Michel Gentil as he was financially unable to come up with a budget for another mainstream feature film. However, in 1974 Rollin directed the horror adventure and self-proclaimed &quot;Expressionist&quot; film &quot;Les démoniaques&quot; which was inspired by the adventure classics he had enormous admiration for in his youth. The film includes Joëlle Cœur and Willy Braque whom Rollin worked with on &quot;Jeunes filles impudiques&quot;. The story follows two young women who have been involved in a shipwreck and are brutally raped and murdered by a group of rogue pirates, only to be resurrected after making love to the devil so that they can seek their revenge. Rollin had many disputes with the producers of the film during production of the project as they insisted on a low budget. He was hospitalized for two weeks following the work due to mental and physical exhaustion. Further problems would arise including the working title, &quot;Les diablesses&quot;, having to be changed as the copyright was not free of charge and with the Castel Twins being unavailable for the roles of the avenging ghosts, the parts where offered to inexperienced actresses Lieva Lone and Patricia Hermenier.

Rollin made a brief return to the erotic vampire genre in 1975 when he wrote and directed &quot;Lèvres de sang&quot; (&quot;Lips of Blood&quot;). The film includes all the surreal dreamlike aspects for which Rollin&#x27;s films are known. The story follows a young man named Frederic who is on a quest to find a woman dressed in white following the discovery of a photo of a ruined château. The photo triggers a suppressed childhood memory, which may be a dream. Despite his mother trying to convince him that it was dream, Frederic becomes fixated and obsessed with location the castle and the woman that may be inside. &quot;Lèvres de sang&quot; features Jean-Loup Philippe, whom Rollin co-wrote the film with, Annie Belle, and Nathalie Perrey, whom Rollin had worked with frequently throughout his career as a credited actress, script writer and editor. The film also sees the return of the Castel Twins as part of a group of vampires.

Due to the commercial failures of both &quot;La rose de fer&quot; and &quot;Lèvres de sang&quot;, Rollin again had no choice but to direct another adult sex film for financial reasons as there was no possible way to produce a feature film for the foreseeable future. &quot;Phantasmes&quot; (&quot;Once Upon a Virgin&quot;) was written and directed by Rollin for release in 1975 and was the first and only pornographic film in which he was credited under his own name because he liked what he did in the film. Rollin mentioned that the film is his &quot;first and final attempt at a serious&quot; adult film, wanting to create a film that didn&#x27;t just &quot;poke fun at sex&quot;. The score for &quot;Phantasmes&quot; is considered one of the films best attributes, courtesy of composer Didier William Lepauw of &quot;Lèvres de sang&quot;.

Between 1976 and 1977, his work consisted strictly of hardcore pornographic films as there was a lack of money and producers reluctant to fund any new mainstream projects due to his previous commercial failures. Seven porn films were produced within this period under his pseudonym Michel Gentil, and one of which, &quot;Suce moi vampire&quot; (&quot;Suck Me Vampire&quot;: the hardcore version of &quot;Lèvres de sang&quot;), he credited himself as Michel Gand. His 1976 hardcore film &quot;Douces pénétraitions&quot; marked the final time the Castel Twins would appear together working for Rollin, and the final time Marie-Pierre would work with him altogether. Catherine would continue to appear in his films for several years.

Jean Rollin returned in 1978, when he wrote and directed &quot;Les raisins de la mort&quot; (&quot;The Grapes of Death&quot;) which has been considered the first French gore film. It has been described as one of the most pivotal films in his entire canon and is seen as a rare departure from his usual dreamlike and poetic works. Following the negative reception and commercial failures of his previous films and having to direct pornographic pictures, Rollin eventually gained financial backing to produce his next mainstream feature. The story here features a young woman, Elisabeth (Marie-Georges Pascal) who is travelling to a secluded vineyard in the mountains owned by her fiancé. There she discovers that the local residents who occupy the village have been transformed into mindless zombies by a dangerous pesticide which contaminated the grapes growing at the vineyard following a wine festival which occurred some days before.

The film includes pornographic actress Brigitte Lahaie, in her first mainstream role, as Rollin was the first French director to recognise her acting capabilities and offer her much more prominent roles in his subsequent films. Rollin stated that &quot;Les raisins de la mort&quot; was his &quot;first traditional, almost conventional, production&quot; which was because the film acquired solid finances with made a change and with special effects supplied by Italian experts. Claude Becognee served as director of photography which added to the film&#x27;s success. Rollin would credit much of the film&#x27;s success to Marie-Georges Pascal&#x27;s portrayal of Elisabeth, whom he would recall delivered a very &quot;moving&quot; performance in the film. &quot;Les raisins de la mort&quot; was shot in the deserted mountain region of Les Cévennes.

The film is often referred to as being influenced by George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. However, it has more in common with Jorge Grau&#x27;s 1974 Spanish-Italian horror film &quot;Let Sleeping Corpses Lie&quot; (also known as &quot;The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue&quot;). The film does not follow the tradition zombie method, instead, Rollin&#x27;s zombies centre on madness with a strong environmentally conscious message. As he has mentioned, the zombies &quot;have retained their consciousness&quot; and they finally &quot;suffer for what they are&quot;. With the film as a notable success, Rollin would continue with pornographic films under a new pseudonym, Robert Xavier, while retaining the Michel Gentil credit.

In 1979, and now established as a somewhat successful director, Rollin created &quot;Fascination&quot; in which he returned to the roots of the fantastique genre his early works are known for. The film is inspired by the short story &quot;Un verre de sang&quot; (&quot;A Glass of Blood&quot;) from French poet Jean Lorrain with tells the tale of wealthy French people, who, at the turn of the century, begin to drink the blood of bulls in order to cure anemia. The title of the film refers to and pays homage to a French magazine of the same name which is dedicated to different forms of eroticism in art. Rollin&#x27;s story of &quot;Fascination&quot; differs slightly from that of Lorrain&#x27;s novel, in that, in the year 1905 a group of wealthy Parisian women arrive at an abattoir to drink the blood of an ox as it is believed to be a curative for anemia. The central story follows two lovers Elizabeth and Eva (Franca Maï and Brigitte Lahaie respectively), chambermaids-in-waiting who reside at a deserted castle and are suddenly interrupted by a thief named Mark (Jean-Pierre Lemaire), who takes refuge at the castle in order to hide from a group of thieves he has stolen coins from. When Mark makes love to Eva, she is forced to go outside and confront the thieves in the nearby stables to make a deal; she is forced to have sex with one of the male thieves and subsequently they are murdered by Eva in an iconic scene with Eva wielding a scythe. It is soon revealed that Elizabeth and Eva are expecting a group of women to arrive where sensual love making takes place and the women are revealed to devour the blood of humans.

The film is often said to be of the vampire genre. However, it does not feature the elements which his early vampire films are known for, aside from the drinking of blood. The production of &quot;Fascination&quot; was not without complications; as it may have been one of the easiest films to shoot in Rollin&#x27;s experience, despite the low budget, the story was met with disapproval from the film&#x27;s producer, Christine Renaud. As Rollin himself had said, the &quot;co-producer wanted (him) to make a very explicit sex film-straight exploitation fare without too much emphasis on the fantastical elements&quot;. Rollin overcame these obstacles and made the film he wanted. Additional members of the crew included Nathalie Perrey, who designed the costumes, and Philippe D&#x27;Aram, who provided the score. It was predicted that &quot;Fascination&quot; would lead to success, as did &quot;Les raisins de la mort&quot;. However, in a setback, one of the directors of UGC, a huge French distributor, cancelled the screenings Rollin had been promised. As the film was yet another financial failure for Rollin, he had little choice but to resume his pornographic works with continued until the end of the 1970s.

===1980s===
As Jean Rollin&#x27;s career continued into the 1980s, he started off the decade with the release of &quot;La nuit des traquées&quot; (&quot;The Night of the Hunted&quot;) in the summer of 1980. This mainstream feature saw the return of pornographic actress Brigitte Lahaie, in her first leading role in a Rollin film. Upon the film&#x27;s debut, it was considered a failure. However, it eventually garnered somewhat of a following in later years, as several of Rollin&#x27;s works have done in the past. &quot;La nuit des traquées&quot; was shot in less than ten days on an extremely low budget, similar to his pornographic films. Rollin admitted that &quot;I was tired of X-films&quot;, as the film was intended to be another hardcore sex film and told the producer &quot;if you want a horror film for the same cost&quot;, then, &quot;I can make it in 9 days&quot;. Rollin came to the decision to cast actors of the pornographic industry in the picture in order to keep production cost down and to give the actors the opportunity to show their legitimate talent. The film stands as a noteworthy piece of work in Rollin&#x27;s canon, as it differs from any of his previous work and is a departure from the fantastique genre that his films are greatly known for; the film is often poetic, yet it serves a realistic tone and chilling atmosphere. Lahaie portrays the character of Elizabeth, a young woman discovered wandering around in the rain on a dark night, by a man named Robert (Vincent Gardère). As Elizabeth has no recollection of why she is there and frequently continues to lose her memory every few minutes, Robert drives her to his apartment in the city where they make love. The following morning while Robert goes to work, a doctor named Francis and a woman named Solange (Bernard Papineau and Rachel Mhas) locate Elizabeth and accompany her back to the clinic where she has escaped from. It is revealed that Elizabeth and fellow patients are currently confined to the hospital for a deteriorating disease in which they have been contaminated by an environmental accident.

In addition to Lahaie, Rollin had actress Martine Delva in mind for the role of Lahaie&#x27;s character&#x27;s friend Véronique. Delva was introduced to Rollin and Lionel Wallman by actor Alain Plumey and when offered the role, she accepted the role. Prior to production, which was intended to take place in La Défense district, she was involved in a serious car accident which left her unconscious with a broken leg and she died within one week from her injuries. The role of Véronique then offered to Dominique Journet. Pornographic actress Catherine Greiner and frequent collaborator, Natalie Perrey appeared as patients at the hospital.

In the early year of the film, it was met with a negative reception and did not please audiences during its release; not receiving a successful response at the Stigès Festival. It did however receive positive reaction when it was screened at a festival in Trieste, where it was applauded and viewed as a highly subversive work. Rollin himself had stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t think it is a very good film and it is probably one of my worst&quot; and that if he could remake just one of his films it would be &quot;La nuit des traquées&quot;.

In 1980, Rollin directed the Spanish zombie horror feature, &quot;Le lac des morts vivants&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Zombie Lake&quot;) under the pseudonym J.A. Lazer. Jésus Franco was intended to direct the film, and with an unfortunate turn of events he became unavailable. At this point, Rollin was planning to take a vacation, and on the morning he was expecting to leave, he received a phone call from the production company Eurociné asking if he would be interested directing the horror film which was due to start filming the next morning, as Franco could not be located. Rollin agreed, and arrived on set the following morning. The company could not attach Rollin&#x27;s name to the project due to issues with the contact, as a Spanish name had to be credited for the film and J.A. Lazer was chosen. &quot;Le lac des morts vivants&quot; was released in 1981 and Rollin admitted that he never really cared for the film. It contains most of the elements which one would expect from a Franco film, and includes Franco&#x27;s frequent collaborators such as actors Howard Vernon, Nadine Pascal, Antonio Mayans and Alain Petit, and composer Daniel White. Photography for the film was courtesy of Max Monteillet, who Rollin would later work with in several projects. Rollin himself made a cameo appearance in the film.

In 1981, Rollin returned with the drama film, &quot;Les paumées du petit matin&quot; (&quot;The Escapees&quot; or &quot;The Runaways&quot;). It marks a departure to the usual horror tones which his films are notable for, and here mixes drama with elements of adventure, thriller and crime, while maintaining erotic and poetic themes and remains a distinctive and unique piece of work from Rollin. The story follows two young women who are confined to mental asylum in the countryside; Michelle (Laurence Dubas), a troubled teenager, has been returned to the asylum after escaping and is forced into a straitjacket. She manages to get the attention of Marie (Christiane Coppé), a teenage girl who is who sits in the garden on a rocking chair, while staring into space and never speaks, by dropping a tin food dish from her bedroom window and the sound somehow brings Marie back to reality. They escape from the asylum and encounter a group of burlesque dancers, a bar singer and a group of women who proceed to rape Marie. Their journey ends when they become involved in crime and death. The cast includes Rollin&#x27;s usual collaborators Louise Dhour, Nathalie Perrey, Brigitte Lahie and a cameo appearance from Rollin himself. &quot;Les paumées du petit matin&quot; unfortunately failed to receive a proper theatrical in 1981 which resulted in it being one of the most difficult Rollin films to find in future. It did however receive its first DVD release in 2009 in the United States courtesy of Redemption Films, with a subsequent release in the United Kingdom. Again with a limited budget an issues with the script, Rollin stated that there were many problems with the production right from the beginning; that it was &quot;an incredible mess&quot;, filled with &quot;clichés and platitudes of melodrama.&quot; Later reviews of the film have been quite positive; Cathal Tohill and Pete Tombs would go so far as to call it a schizophrenic work in their wonderful Immoral Tales, but they would also note that &quot;the beginning and end are pure Rollin&quot; and &quot;what is good in (The Escapees) is very good.&quot;

His 1982 film, &quot;La morte vivante&quot; (&quot;The Living Dead Girl&quot;) was his most commercial and successful work since &quot;Les raisins de la mort&quot;. In addition to its small budget, Rollin again had to contend with producers to construct a film that he wanted, as they required another zombie piece. He was reluctant to do so and was influenced to create a film with combinations from his previous works. Rollin described that the living dead girl is sort of a vampire woman who devours the blood of humans, taking the idea from his vampire works, but not exactly making her a vampire. The gore is a notable aspect taken from &quot;Les raisins de la mort&quot;. His usual poetic, supernatural and horror themes are still present within the film. Rollin created the story of a young woman named Catherine Valmont (Françoise Blanchard) who has been dead and buried in her family vault beneath the Valmont mansion for the past two years. As three thieves enter the vaults and plan to rob Catherine and her deceased relative of their jewellery as they lay in their coffins, an earth tremor occurs, which suddenly resurrects Catherine. Unaware of her surroundings, she must acquire human victims and drink their blood to prevent her descending into madness and possibly death, with drifting in and out of childhood memories of her childhood friend, Hélène (Marina Pierro). During which, a photographer, Barbara (Carina Barone), becomes fascinated by Catherine when she discovers her and thinks she is quite peculiar, and sets out to uncover a mystery. Catherine&#x27;s childhood friend, Hélène is intending to buy the Valmont mansion, which is currently on the market and a strange phone call leads her to the home where she discovers that Catherine is alive and the bodies of the thieves and the real estate agent and her boyfriend. Trying to convince herself that Catherine did not actually die, she realises that she has returned from the dead and must help her by bringing her unsuspecting victims. Some of the financing for the film was courtesy of Jacques Raif, who co-wrote the feature. The film&#x27;s photographer Pierre LeBlond, found a castle which would become the Valmont mansion, which they rented. The castle provided accommodation for the cast and crew, in which the owner offered to cook. According to Rollin, the owner insisted on being referred to as &quot;His Lordship&quot; and that he was very difficult to get along with Actress, Françoise Blanchard was introduced to Rollin by Fanny Magier, a co-star actress who appeared in the film. When Blanchard arrived, Rollin was unsure whether to offer her the role of Catherine due to the fact that in the first scene in which her character is resurrected, Blanchard appeared wearing trousers which wasn&#x27;t required for the scene and Rollin did not ask her to remove them. She did however receive the role due to good contact. Blanchard showed great professionalism in her role and in one particular scene, the final scene of the film, in which Blanchard&#x27;s character cries and screams after devouring her childhood friend, the crew became concerned over her mental state as they thought she has descended into madness. She gave an amazing performance for the role. During the preparation of the film, Rollin had been to Rome with Lionel Wallman to find an actress to portray the role of Hélène. Rollin had Teresa Ann Savoy in mind for the role, whom he was greatly impressed with. After speaking with Savoy and showing her a script for a pornographic picture which was in English and devoid of interest and not for &quot;La morte vivante&quot;, as she didn&#x27;t speak French, she refused the role and told her agent that she would never in her life shoot with a guy like him. His second choice was actress Marina Pierro, a recurring collaborator with director Walerian Borowczyk, whom Rollin instantly liked. Pierro accepted the role. In the role of the photographers, American actor Mike Marshall, whom Rollin enjoyed working with during the production received the role of Greg and Canadian actress Carina Barone, was offered the role of Barbara due to a previous actress who featured in &quot;Les paumées du petit matin&quot; turning it down as she unmistakable believed that it was supposedly an erotic film. The film was a commercial success within theatres and received quite a positive reception, especially in Italy. Upon its release, Rollin was betrayed by a dishonest distributor who premiered in a select number of small theatres behind his back, as the film deserved a much larger audience in highly established theatres. However, &quot;La morte vivante&quot; was selected in many festivals which gave the film little success, particularly in Rome where Rollin&#x27;s friend, Andriano Pintaldi presented the film in his festival where it was given the public&#x27;s award.

After directing three additional pornographic features following &quot;La morte Vivante&quot;, Rollin&#x27;s next feature film, &quot;Les trottoirs de Bangkok&quot; (&quot;The Sidewalks of Bangkok&quot;) was released in 1984. It is a rare production for Rollin, in that it does not contain his traditional fare of the supernatural, horror, or the fantastique genre. It is highly influenced by Rollin&#x27;s childhood passion for old serials as it contains themes of adventure, crime and mystery, comic-book fantasy and is inspired by the 1932 Boris Karloff classic &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot;. The leading protagonist of the film is pornographic actress, Yoko, whom Rollin mentioned that he had &quot;never worked with an actor who was so open-minded and easy to direct.&quot; She portrays the role of Eva, who is on the run from the French Secret Service and a rival syndicate who desperate require a deadly chemical which she possesses. This is her only mainstream role outside of the pornographic industry. Françoise Blanchard returns in her second film with Rollin, as she appears in the role of Claudine, a woman who works for the syndicate and is forced to locate Eva and hand her over to her villainous boss, instead she chooses to protect Eva. Supporting cast includes Argentina actor Gérard Landry, Israeli actress Brigitte Borghese, Jean-Pierre Bouyxou, whom Rollin has worked with on numerous occasions throughout his career, and a cameo appearance from Rollin. On a limited budget, and again working with producer Lionel Wallman and cinematographer Claude Becognee, the production of &quot;Les trottoris de Bangkok&quot; was filmed in several locations, many of which were not given permission to; the Chinese Quarter of Porte d&#x27;Italie and on the docks where goods from Asia were unloaded, an abandoned den near the Champs-Élysées, and on part of the French railroad. The film became a success and Rollin admitted that despite the fact that the film was a mess, he said &quot;the entire shoot was great fun.&quot; Working with Yoko prompted Rollin to write a new film which included her alongside Brigitte Lahaie which unfortunately never became a film as Yoko retired from acting in the early nineties.

Rollin received minor work following &quot;Les trottoirs de Bangkok&quot;; in 1985, he resumed his pseudonymous work as &quot;Michel Gentil&quot; with a non-pornographic feature, the slapstick comedy, &quot;Ne prends pas les poulets pour des pigeons&quot; which reunited Brigitte Borghese and Gérard Landry from his previous film, and included French actor and comedian Popeck. Rollin was hired, and therefore his real name was not attached to the project. In 1988, he received the uncredited directorial role in the erotic sequel &quot;Emmanuelle 6&quot;, for which he wrote the screenplay. The film suffered many flaws during production under direction from Bruno Zincone and Rollin became involved in an attempt to salvage what he could and see that production was completed for the financiers.

At the end of the decade, Rollin created &quot;Perdues dans New York&quot; (&quot;Lost in New York&quot;) which was produced in 1989. Rollin mentioned that the film was &quot;an anthology of all the themes and obsessive images I have used in my films&quot;, and that it, &quot;brought to an end what had been started within the previous 13 films.&quot; A friend of Rollin&#x27;s who was a producer insisted his help as he need location shots of New York an upcoming TV series he was working on. Rollin agreed and travelled to New York with a small film crew and a 16mm camera. While filming the shots, Rollin was struck with an idea to improvise a theme in which two young women are separated and desperately search for one another. He produced the film with a runtime of just under one hour and immediately struggled to find distribution, whether it be released to theatres or television. It was difficult to find distribution for independent and exploitation pictures in the late eighties as in a time of revolution and change, distributors would only pick up more commercial and high-budget film. It was not until the following years that the film found its audience on the home video market. Initially, &quot;Perdues dans New York&quot; was to be the final production of Rollin&#x27;s canon as he has become ill during this period, and he expressed gratitude to his many fan by paying homage to his early works.

Despite his intentions to retire from directing following &quot;Perdues dans New York&quot;, his final film of the 1980s, &quot;Killing Car&quot; (working title &quot;Femme dangereuse&quot;) was produced in 1989. It is a revenge thriller and one of his most underrated and overlooked works. Initially intended to be a softcore production under the Michel Gentil pseudonym, Rollin attached his own name to the project and made it one of his most personal and self-referential of all his works. The film was shot on 16mm and in less than a week on a minimal budget of under $100,000. Australian model Tiki Tsang, originally of Brisbane, Queensland, had been residing in Paris, France for sometime when she was discovered by Rollin and offered her the role of &quot;The Car Woman&quot;, a strange woman who steals an old Buick and proceeds to kill a number of people to seek revenge for a past tragedy. The part of &quot;The Car Woman&quot; was written especially for Tsang in what is the only film credit to her name. &quot;Killing Car&quot; gives nod to previous Rollin works including Tsang emerging from a grandfather clock (as did Dominique in an iconic scene from &quot;Les frisson des vampires&quot;). Max Monteillet returned as cinematographer and Philippe Brejean provided the score. Cast includes recurring collaborators Jean-Pierre Bouyxou and Jean-Loup Philippe. Following the production, Rollin was hospitalized due to exhaustion and started editing the film after his recovery. The editing process lasted two years. Several problems would arise during post-production, as the film found it difficult to receive distribution, like &quot;Perdues dans New York&quot;, if it could not receive a theatrical distribution, Rollin would settle for a video or television release. The film was eventually released in 1993. It was announced that no usable print or negative of the film exists today, and all known film negatives are considered lost.

===1990s===
Rollin&#x27;s final adult production came in 1994 when he made a brief return to direct (uncredited) and wrote the scenario for &quot;Le Parfume de Mathilde&quot; (&quot;The Scent of Mathilde&quot;). Rollin was initially required as a screenwriter for the production due to the fact that he was to replace producer Marc Dorcel&#x27;s in-house auteur Michele Ricaud, who has just recently passed away. However, Rollin became co-director of the made-for-video film. Following his final time working on a sex film, Rollin later returned to his traditional works when he would go on to resume what he was best known for.

Rollin continued his career into the 1990s, following what was intended to be a brief return in 1994 when he directed and wrote a final pornographic film. He remained true to form for what were to be his final years of film making, and his next feature went into production in 1995; &quot;Les deux orphelines vampires&quot; (&quot;The Two Orphan Vampires&quot;) saw the return of his most recognizable work, and his first vampire film since 1975&#x27;s &quot;Levres de sang&quot;. With the then recent increase in popularity of Rollin&#x27;s works, and with the resurgence with the vampire genre in general, most notable with &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, this prompted Rollin to create a new vampire feature, quite different from Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1992 blockbuster, as he stated that it was &quot;not a good film at all&quot;, and that &quot;it just doesn&#x27;t work for one second&quot;. The idea of the film was based upon Rollin&#x27;s novel of the same name and went into production in June 1995 for a mere ₣3,000,000, which is actually more than his prior works received. Locations for the shoot included four days in New York at the beginning, with the remaining three weeks in Paris. Cinematography was provided by Norbert Marfaing-Sintes, who previously worked with Italian director Duccio Tessari, as Max Monteillet was not available. Nathalie Perrey introduced Rollin to Marfaing-Sintes, as she had experience working with Marfaing-Sintes in many films; to show his gratitude, Rollin offered Perrey a role in &quot;Les deux orphelines vampires&quot;. The leading roles were offered to two inexperienced actresses, Alexandra Pic and Isabelle Teboul, whom Rollin choose while answering a newspaper ad they had printed. Brigitte Lahaie received a minor role in the film. Following an extensive period in post-production, the film was eventually released on 9 July 1997.

His next directorial feature, &quot;La fiancée de Dracula&quot; (&quot;The Fiancée of Dracula&quot;) went into production in 1999. Rollin had written the screenplay for the film, as he did with many of his previous works. During which time, Rollin was receiving dialysis for kidney disease and for periods of time, did not remain with the film crew and production was shared with Jean-Noël Delamarre in his absence, while Rolling was staying at a hotel in Caen. Filming locations included the islands of Chausey where the majority of the filming took place, a cemetery in Épinay-Champlâtreux, a castle in Blandy, Seine-et-Marne, and port of Pourville-lès-Dieppes. Long-time collaborators Brigitte Lahaie, Catherine Castel and Nathalie Perrey returned for prominent roles in the film. Rollin&#x27;s niece, Sandrine Thoquet appeared in the film as a young vampire burned by the rays of the sun. Following production, Rollin received a kidney transplant in October 2000 during the post-production which lasted for almost two years. The film was successfully shown in theatres on 14 August 2002, for which Rollin was not completely satisfied of the release date. However, he was pleased that it was released to theaters and was somewhat well received.

==Personal life and death==
Rollin was married to Simone Rollin Roth Le Gentil (née Morel), with whom he had two sons, Serge and Carel. He was married to Simone until his death.

Rollin died on 15 December 2010 after a long battle with cancer and was survived by his wife Simone, son Serge and granddaughter Gabrielle. He is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Rollin&#x27;s son, Carel (1973–2001), and his wife, Simone (1934–2016), rest alongside him.

<doc id="653715" wikidata="Q7598213" url="?curid=653715" title="Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode">
<text>The Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode (SCSU) is a Unicode Technical Standard for reducing the number of bytes needed to represent Unicode text, especially if that text uses mostly characters from one or a small number of per-language character blocks. It does so by dynamically mapping values in the range 128–255 to offsets within particular blocks of 128 characters. The initial conditions of the encoder mean that existing strings in ASCII and ISO-8859-1 that do not contain C0 control codes other than NULL TAB CR and LF can be treated as SCSU strings. Since most alphabets do reside in blocks of contiguous Unicode codepoints, texts that use small alphabets and either ASCII punctuation or punctuation that fits within the window for the main alphabet can be encoded at one byte per character (plus setup overhead, which for common languages is often only 1 byte), most other punctuation can be encoded at 2 bytes per symbol through non-locking shifts. SCSU can also switch to UTF-16 internally to handle non-alphabetic languages.

==History &amp; use ==
Reuters originally developed SCSU, then under the name RCSU for Reuters Compression Scheme for Unicode.

At first the Unicode Consortium considered it to be a character encoding, but in 1999 changed its mind: although it was still considered a transfer encoding syntax, for a while it was no longer considered a character encoding because different compressors might yield different outputs for the same text. However, in 2004 this decision was reverted and now SCSU is considered a &quot;compressing&quot; character encoding scheme, as opposed to a simple or compound character encoding scheme.

Roman Czyborra (of GNU Unifont) wrote a decompressor. The IBM-contributed decompressor is found in International Components for Unicode, along with a compressor written in Java. Simpler reference codecs are available as attachments to TR6.

Symbian OS, an operating system for mobile phones and other mobile devices, uses SCSU to serialize strings.

SQL Server 2008 R2 uses SCSU to compress Unicode values (there meaning from strings in UCS-2 encoding) stored in &quot;nchar(n)&quot; and &quot;nvarchar(n)&quot; columns, achieving space savings between 15% and 50% (while UTF-8 only has this 50% reduction for ASCII subset of Unicode), depending on the language of the data.

== The scheme ==
The following sections briefly describe the anatomy of a compressed SCSU stream. For a full description (matching that of a decompressor), see the UTS #6 document.

=== Encoding modes ===
SCSU starts in the single-byte mode, which uses the compressed Window encoding. There exist commands to switch to a UTF-16BE &quot;Unicode&quot; mode, and to switch to the single-byte mode from that mode.

=== Window encoding ===
The core of SCSU lies in the windows for which the meanings of bytes 0x80-0xff are defined. There are eight static windows for simpler scripts and punctuation, and 6 types of dynamic windows (plus &quot;half Unicode block&quot; windows and custom Windows for the supplementary planes) for scripts making use of more characters.

Both simple and dynamic windows are selected by special command characters. For individual characters that do not fit into the current block, command characters for quoting are provided.

== Comparison with general-purpose plain text compression schemes ==
Because UTF-16 or UTF-8 text might occupy more space than its equivalent in pre-Unicode encodings did, one might want to use compression such as SCSU to mitigate this problem. In comparison with general-purpose compressors, it is not necessarily advantageous to use SCSU. Also, while it can be used as a text encoding, because of the stateful nature of the algorithm difficulties may arise when using it as an internal text representation since basic text operations become non-trivial.

Treated purely as a compression algorithm, SCSU is inferior to most commonly used general-purpose algorithms for texts of over a few kilobytes.

SCSU does have the advantage that it can usefully compress texts that are only a few characters long, whereas most full-scale compressors need hundreds of bytes of data to break even against their own overhead. In Symbian OS, SCSU is used even for Clipboard operations, e.g. Cut, Copy &amp; Paste of small strings of text.

== In HTML ==

Supporting SCSU in HTML documents is prohibited by the W3C and WHATWG HTML standards because HTML wasn&#x27;t designed with non-ASCII-compatible encodings in mind. In the past, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities due to browsers&#x27; poor handling of such encodings have been demonstrated.

<text>Pierre Woodman (born Pierre André Nicolas Gerbier; 29 April 1963) is a French pornographic film director. He is best known for his casting series where he specializes in having first-time female adult models perform rough anal sex and double penetration. Woodman has been accused of violating consent and coercing models to perform acts against their will, including using physical violence to force models to swallow semen and urine. Early in his career, Woodman would arrange meetings with women in hotel rooms under the guise of fashion modelling before revealing his intent of having them engage in sexual acts. 

==Career==
Woodman joined the army at age 17, and later became a policeman. In 1986, he started a career as a fashion and TV photographer. In 1989, he took part in launching the magazine &quot;Hot Video&quot;, as a reporter. In 1992, he started working for Private Media Group, Inc., for which he made several movies, such as &quot;The Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Tatiana&quot;, and &quot;Riviera&quot;. In 1997, Woodman launched his series &quot;Casting X&quot;. 

In 1999, Woodman began to produce and release his &quot;Superfuckers&quot; series for Private. At the end of the year, he received an invitation from Larry Flynt, owner of LFP, Inc. and a publisher of the magazine &quot;Hustler&quot;. Woodman produced several movies for the company before departing in 2005.

In 2004, after playing himself in the Spanish film &quot;Yo Puta&quot;, alongside Denise Richards and Daryl Hannah, he did several photo-shoots for fashion magazines, such as &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Blast&quot;.

Woodman then launched a program affiliation on the Internet called &quot;Spider-Cash&quot;, to distribute its films in the form of video sequences, after Berth Milton, head of Private, asked Woodman to return to work for him in 2005. Woodman left Private in June 2006 for a second time and announced that he was creating his own production and distribution company, Woodman Entertainment.

===&quot;Castings X&quot; productions ===
With the breakup of the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Central and Eastern Europe became a new center of pornographic production, with actresses available for a fraction of the cost of American performers. In 1992, Woodman started his casting film series for Private. Woodman&#x27;s &quot;Castings X&quot; movies were first released in October 1997. The movies were released by Private between 1997 and 2003, after which Hustler started distributing them under the label &quot;Hustler Casting Couch&quot;. In April 2008, Woodman announced that Woodman Entertainment would issue new movies and scenes of the Casting X series.

The casting scenes are typically filmed in hotel rooms, usually in Central Europe. During the 1990s, the actresses would be invited to a meeting with Woodman under the guise of working as a fashion model, which would be filmed with a hidden camera. Woodman would then show the actresses a Private magazine featuring pornographic images and then inviting them to do similar sexual acts with him. While some actresses would initially refuse to perform the acts and voice their disappointment at being tricked, Woodman would spend an extensive amount of time convincing them to change their mind, often cutting this portion from the final movie or scene. The sexual acts often involve rough anal sex with slapping and verbal abuse, and urination. During the 2000s, Woodman would begin interviewing models before engaging in sexual acts, after which he would often bring in several male co-performers to engage in group sex acts, at times to the surprise of the female model. 

Woodman has released 225 DVDs from his &quot;Casting X&quot; series, featuring mostly European actresses. In an interview, he claimed to have more than 7,000 scenes in stock. In 2009, the Netherlands branch of HBO TV made a 52-minute report about his life called &quot;Pierre Woodman Story&quot;.

==Controversies==
In 2013, following the airing of a documentary on Woodman, the French online magazine &quot;Le Tag Parfait&quot; published an article that accused the director of pushing unsuspecting performers into engaging in unplanned sexual acts with him. In 2017, Lana Rhoades accused Woodman of coercing her into performing acts she did not want to do during a shoot and that he allegedly admitted to violating another woman&#x27;s rights to her. In 2022, Woodman was interviewed by Louis Theroux for a BBC broadcast and was questioned about disregarding his models&#x27; consent.

==Personal life==

Woodman has been married three times and is the father of four children. He was divorced from the Russian porn star Tania Russof in 2000. Since 2002, he has lived with adult model Sophie Paris, who he met during a shoot for his casting series. He is the father of French writer Alexandra Geyser.

<doc id="653732" wikidata="Q5600610" url="?curid=653732" title="1970 Greater London Council election">
<text>The third election to the [[Greater London Council]] was held on 9 April 1970 and saw a Conservative victory with a reduced majority.

==Electoral arrangements==
New constituencies to be used for elections to Parliament and also for elections to the GLC had not yet been settled, so the London boroughs were used as multi-member &#x27;first past the post&#x27; electoral areas. Westminster was joined with the City of London for this purpose. Each electoral area returned between 2 and 4 councillors. Polling day was 9 April 1970, except in Hammersmith where it was delayed until 27 April 1970 because of the death of a candidate.

==Results==
===General election of councillors===
The Conservative Party won a majority of seats at the election.

With an electorate of 5,524,384, there was a turnout of 35.2%. Labour recovered from its mauling three years previously, but did so primarily in working-class areas. Consequently, relatively few seats changed hands: Labour won back Camden, Greenwich, Hammersmith, Lewisham, Wandsworth, and one seat in Lambeth. The results did enable Labour to take back control of the Inner London Education Authority and were one of the factors used by Prime Minister Harold Wilson in deciding to call a general election soon after.

Among those who were first elected to the GLC in 1970 were Tony Banks (Labour, Hammersmith, later Minister for Sport) and Sir George Young (Conservative, Ealing, later a cabinet minister under John Major). The election is also significant as it was at a meeting in support of the Conservative candidates in Lambeth that John Major met Norma Johnson, who became his wife.

1 These parties were created by a group of students standing in Haringey, who declared that they intended to make a mockery of the election.

===Aldermanic election===
In addition to the 100 councillors, there were sixteen aldermen elected by the council. Eight aldermen elected in 1967 continued to serve until 1973 and eight elected in 1964 retired before the 1970 election. Eight aldermen were elected by the council on 28 April 1970 to serve until 1976. 

Aldermen elected in 1970, to retire in 1976:
The aldermen divided 11 Conservative and 5 Labour, so that the Conservatives had 76 members to 40 for Labour following the aldermanic election.

==By-elections 1970–1973==

No seats changed hands in by-elections during this term. The Conservatives retained Kensington and Chelsea on 2 December 1971 after the death of Seton Forbes-Cockell, and Barnet on 19 October 1972 after the death of Arthur Peacock. Labour retained Wandsworth on 15 June 1972 after the death of Sir Norman Prichard. No seats were vacant at the end of the term.

There were three aldermanic by-elections caused by the resignations of David Gilbert Baker (Conservative), Brian Caldwell Cook Batsford (Conservative) and Christopher John Chataway (Conservative) in 1970. Three replacement aldermen were elected on 28 April 1970 (coinciding with the normal election of alderman). Ewan Geddes Carr (Labour), Illtyd Harrington (Labour) and William Watts (Labour) were elected, to serve until 1973. 

Three further aldermanic by-elections were caused by the resignations of Reginald Ernest Prentice (Labour) in 1971, Timothy Charles Farmer (Labour) in 1971 and Gerard Folliott Vaughan (Conservative) in 1972. Alfred Frederick Joseph Chorley (Labour) was elected by the council on 4 May 1971, to serve until 1976. Bernard James Perkins (Labour) was elected by the council on 19 October 1971, to serve until 1973. Gordon William Herbert Taylor (Conservative) was elected by the council on 3 October 1972, to serve until 1976.

<doc id="653735" wikidata="Q24311" url="?curid=653735" title="Richard Meinertzhagen">
<text>Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, CBE, DSO (3 March 1878 – 17 June 1967) was a British soldier, intelligence officer, and ornithologist. He had a decorated military career spanning Africa and the Middle East. He was credited with creating and executing the Haversack Ruse in October 1917, during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War, but his participation in this matter has since been refuted.

While early biographies lionized Meinertzhagen as a master of military strategy and espionage, later works such as &quot;The Meinertzhagen Mystery&quot; present him as a fraud for fabricating stories of his feats and speculated he murdered his wife, in addition to mass extrajudicial killings while in the colonial service. The discovery of stolen museum bird specimens resubmitted as original discoveries has raised serious doubts on the veracity of many of his ornithological records.

==Background and youth==
Meinertzhagen was born into a wealthy, socially connected British family. His father, Daniel Meinertzhagen, was head of the Frederick Huth &amp; Co. merchant-banking dynasty, which had an international reputation, that one biographer claimed in the introduction to his book was second in importance only to the Rothschilds. His mother was Georgina Potter, sister of Beatrice Webb, a co-founder of the London School of Economics. Meinertzhagen&#x27;s surname derives from Meinerzhagen in Germany, the home of an ancestor. On his mother&#x27;s side (the wealthy Potter family), he was of English descent. Among his relations were &quot;many of Britain&#x27;s titled, rich, and influential personages.&quot; Although he had his doubts, he also claimed to be a distant descendant of Philip III of Spain. His nephew, Daniel Meinertzhagen (1915–1991), was a chairman of Lazard. His niece, Teresa Georgina Mayor (1915–1996), married the 3rd Baron Rothschild.

Young Richard was sent as a boarding student to Aysgarth School in the north of England, then was enrolled at Fonthill in Sussex, and finally at Harrow School, where his stay overlapped with that of Winston Churchill. In 1895, at the age of 18, he reluctantly obeyed his father&#x27;s wishes to join the family bank as a clerk. He was assigned to offices in Cologne and Bremen. There, he picked up the German language, but remained uninterested in banking. After he returned to the bank&#x27;s home office in England in 1897, he received his father&#x27;s approval to join the Hampshire Yeomanry. In 1911, he married Armorel, the daughter of Colonel Herman Le Roy-Lewis, who commanded the Hampshire Yeomanry.

Meinertzhagen&#x27;s passion for bird-watching began as a child. His brother Daniel and he were encouraged by a family friend, the philosopher Herbert Spencer, who, like another family friend, Charles Darwin, was an ardent empiricist. Spencer would take young Richard and Daniel on walks around the family home of Mottisfont Abbey, urging them to observe and enquire on the habits of birds. Around 1887, they kept a pet sparrowhawk, which was taken to Hyde Park to let it prey on sparrows. The first serious ornithologist whom Richard met was Brian Hodgson. Daniel took an interest in bird illustration, which brought them in contact with Archibald Thorburn and led to an introduction to Joseph Wolf and G.E. Lodge. They had first met Richard Bowdler Sharpe at the Natural History Museum in 1886 and noted that he was very fond of encouraging children, showing them around the bird collections.

==Military career==
Lacking the desire to make a career in merchant banking, Meinertzhagen took examinations for a commission in the British Army, and after training at Aldershot, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers on 18 January 1899. He was sent to India to join a battalion of his regiment. Other than routine regimental soldiering, he participated in big-game hunting, was promoted, sent on sick leave to England, and after recovery posted to the relocated battalion at Mandalay in Burma. He was promoted lieutenant on 8 February 1900. He then started his &quot;zealous campaign&quot; for a transfer to Africa, and in April 1902, was seconded for service with the Foreign Office, which attached him to the 3rd (East African) Battalion of the King&#x27;s African Rifles. The following month, he finally arrived at Mombasa in British East Africa.

===Kenya and South Africa===
Meinertzhagen was assigned as a staff officer with the King&#x27;s African Rifles (KAR). Again, he participated in big-game hunting, but &quot;regarded himself as scientist-explorer first, and only incidentally as a soldier.&quot; His maps, landscapes, and wildlife drawings proved him an artist of exceptional talent. In 1903, he was delegated to conduct a wild animal census in the Serengeti and Athi plains.

In 1902 and 1903 when Meinertzhagen travelled through Northern Gikuyuland, it is believed on British imperial missions, he is credited to have given the name Nyeri to the place where modern day Nyeri Town stands today. The name is from the local name of nearby Nyeri Hill. He later on, after establishing relations with local chiefs, got into an altercation because of the government taxes he imposed, and harassment. Meinertzhagen ordered his soldiers to burn Gikuyu villages in the night, without warning. This resulted in the death of more than a hundred people.

During Meinertzhagen&#x27;s assignment to Africa, frequent native &quot;risings and rebellions&quot; occurred. By 1903 KAR&#x27;s retaliatory ventures focused on confiscation of livestock, a highly effective form of punishment, and &quot;the KAR had become accomplished cattle-rustlers.&quot; In 1904, one such punitive expedition was commanded by a Captain Francis Arthur Dickinson of the 3rd KAR with participation by Meinertzhagen, where more than 11,000 cattle were captured at the cost of 3 men killed and 33 wounded. The body count on the African side was estimated at 1,500 from the Kikuyu and Embu tribes.

In the Kenya Highlands in 1905, Meinertzhagen ended the anti-colonial Nandi Resistance, by killing its leader, the Nandi Orkoiyot (spiritual leader) Koitalel Arap Samoei. He arranged a meeting to negotiate by Koitalel&#x27;s home on 19 October 1905, at which he planned to kill him. Meinertzhagen shot Koitalel at point-blank range while shaking his hand and his men killed Koitatlel&#x27;s accompanying entourage, including most of his advisors. It is claimed that he also decapitated Koitalel and sent some of Koitalel&#x27;s body parts to England. Initially, he had been able to orchestrate a cover-up and was commended for the incident. However, after news of what had actually happened became known, Meinertzhagen claimed self-defense and eventually, after a third court of inquiry, he was cleared by the presiding officer, Brig. William Manning. Meinertzhagen collected tribal artefacts after this revolt. Some of these items, including a walking stick and baton belonging to Koitalel, were returned to Kenya in 2006. Pressure from the Colonial Department on the War Office eventually brought about Meinertzhagen&#x27;s removal from Africa, as &quot;he had become a negative symbol&quot; and on 28 May 1906 &quot;he found himself on a ship being trundled back to England in disgrace and in disgust.&quot; Meinertzhagen spent 1902 to 1906 in East Africa with a pay of £400 but returned from Africa with £4000, the rest being earnings from hunting, largely from the sale of ivory.

Captain Meinertzhagen then spent the latter part of 1906 at &quot;dreary administrative War Office desk jobs pushing papers.&quot; However, &quot;... by making full use of his wide network of contacts in high places&quot; he was able to rehabilitate himself and was assigned to the Fusiliers&#x27; Third Battalion in South Africa, arriving at Cape Town on 3 February 1907. He served there in 1908 and 1909, then on Mauritius. By 1913, he was again in India.

At the beginning of the First World War, he was posted to the intelligence staff of the British Indian Expeditionary Force. His map-making skills were much valued and recognized, though his assessments of the strength of the German Schutztruppe and other contributions to the conduct of the Battle of Tanga and the Battle of Kilimanjaro were a complete miss. From January 1915 through August 1916, Meinertzhagen served as chief of British military intelligence for the East Africa theatre at Nairobi. His diary record of this campaign contain harsh assessments of senior officers, of the role played by the Royal Navy, and of the quality of the Indian units sent to East Africa. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in February 1916. In November of that year General J.C. Smuts ordered him invalided to England.

===Palestine campaign===

During 1917, Meinertzhagen was transferred from East Africa to be put in place at Deir el-Belah. He made contact with Nili, a Jewish spy network headed by the agronomist Aaron Aaronsohn. Meinertzhagen later asserted that he respected Aaronsohn more than anyone else he ever met. They were instrumental in contacting Jewish officers in the Ottoman army, amongst many other sources, for information, and attempted their defection to the allies. A German Jewish doctor stationed at el-Afulah railway junction gave valuable reconnaissance reports on troop movements south. Meinertzhagen&#x27;s department produced regular maps from the data showing the dispositions of enemy forces in the desert. In October 1917, the Turks broke up the network by intercepting a carrier pigeon and subjecting the Jews to hideous torture. Sarah Aaronsohn, (Aaron&#x27;s sister), age 27, a key figure, committed suicide in her home after torture. Meinertzhagen&#x27;s sources of information dwindled to the occasional prisoner caught out by patrols and deserters.

====The &#x27;Haversack Ruse&#x27; ====
He is frequently credited with a surprise attack known as the Haversack Ruse in October 1917; during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War, according to his diary, he let a haversack containing false British battle plans fall into Ottoman military hands, thereby bringing about the British victory in the Battle of Beersheba and Gaza.

The documents were taken to Kress von Kressenstein, who examined them and doubted their authenticity. According to an account by Turkish Colonel Hussein Husni, Chief of Staff of 7th Army, Meinertzhagen&#x27;s German-sounding name caused confusion in the German and Turkish staff as to why a British officer would have a German name and added to the suspicion of the inauthenticity of the documents. Von Kressenstein later wrote that he did not believe the documents were real: No changes in German-Turkish positions took place in the weeks leading up to the British operations at Beersheba or Gaza, indicating that the ruse had no effect on the decision-making of the Turkish-German leadership. To the fault of von Kressenstein, no significant reinforcements were sent to Beersheba even though the deception was uncovered.

Although Meinertzhagen&#x27;s participation in this ruse has been refuted (he neither planned nor executed it), his stories of the ruse themselves would have a major impact on events in the Second World War. Research conducted by Brian Garfield, author of &quot;The Meinertzhagen Mystery&quot;, has proven that the idea was actually that of Lieutenant Colonel J.D. Belgrave, a member of Allenby&#x27;s general staff, and the rider who dropped the satchel was Arthur Neate. Arthur Neate was an active military intelligence officer at the time when a &quot;Times&quot; article was printed in 1927 describing the Haversack Ruse and Meinertzhagen&#x27;s (fraudulent) role in it. Neate, therefore, could not publicly refute the false claims without violating security norms, though he did finally correct the record in 1956. The true author of the ruse, Lt Col Belgrave, had never contradicted Meinertzhagen&#x27;s account because he was killed in action on 13 June 1918.

In the Second World War, the ruse inspired Winston Churchill to create the London Controlling Section, which planned countless Allied deception campaigns during the war, and such operations as Mincemeat and diversions covering D-Day were influenced by the Haversack Ruse.

====Military intelligence reservations====
Another story from 1917 refers to a number of Arab spies suspected of wandering through British lines in disguise. Meinertzhagen caught a couple of Arabs and extracted the identity of their Ottoman paymaster, a merchant who lived in Beersheba. He sent him money with an Arab he knew would talk. The merchant was executed by the Turks. &quot;Near the end of 1917, having participated in no battles, he was ordered back to England for reassignment [and] found office duty as dreary as ever.&quot;

Meinertzhagen was outraged by the continual sorties to bomb the enemy camp, given the bombs always missed their target and invaluable reconnaissance planes were shot down with lives lost. On one such raid, as many as eight planes went down. From an intelligence viewpoint, it was pointless, as the Germans gave as good as they got in return to no overall gain. He hated the notion that the Holy City of Jerusalem would be bombed from the air, and expressed outrage when this occurred, for example, the bombing of the enemy&#x27;s HQ at Mount of Olives. Allenby told him that the Turks had to be induced to escape Jerusalem, northwards if possible, so a boundary was set at , a no-fighting zone to facilitate their flight.

===Mandate Palestine and Israel===
From the spring of 1918 until August, he commuted between England and France, delivering lectures on intelligence to groups of officers – then was assigned full-time to France at GHQ. After the armistice, he attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and was Edmund Allenby&#x27;s chief political officer, involved in the creation of the Palestine Mandate, which eventually led to the creation of the state of Israel. In the film &quot;A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia&quot; (1990), which depicted the Paris Peace Conference, Meinertzhagen was a major character and was played by Jim Carter. His unpublished diaries hint, among other exploits, at a successful rescue attempt of one of the Czarist-Russian Grand Duchesses, possibly Tatiana (see &quot;The Romanov Conspiracies&quot; by Michael Occleshaw).

In the August 1920 Report of the Palin Commission, Meinertzhagen was attacked for an alleged bias:
Israeli historian Tom Segev considers Meinertzhagen both a &quot;great antisemite and a great Zionist,&quot; quoting from his &quot;Middle East Diary&quot;: &quot;I am imbued with antisemitic feelings. It was indeed an accursed day that allowed Jews and not Christians to introduce to the world the principles of Zionism and that allowed Jewish brains and Jewish money to carry them out, almost unhelped by Christians save a handful of enthusiasts in England.&quot;

In Weizmann&#x27;s biography, he wrote of Meinertzhagen,At our first meeting, he told me the following story of himself: he had been an anti-Semite, though all he had known about Jews had been what he picked up in a few casual, anti-Semitic books. But he had also met some of the rich Jews, who had not been particularly attractive. But then, in the Near East, he had come across Aaron Aaronsohn, a Palestinian Jew, also a man of great courage and superior intelligence, devoted to Palestine. Aaronson was a botanist, and the discoverer of wild wheat. With Aaronson, Meinertzhagen had many talks about Palestine, and was so impressed by him that he completely changed his mind and became an ardent Zionist – which he has remained till this day. And that not merely in words. Whenever he can perform a service for the Jews or Palestine he will go out of his way to do so.

In 1973 &quot;Middle East Diary&quot; was published in Hebrew, translated by Aharon Amir.

===Diaries===
Meinertzhagen was a prolific diarist and published four books based on these diaries. However, his &quot;Middle East Diary&quot; contains entries that are in all probability fictional, including those on T. E. Lawrence and a bit of absurd slapstick concerning Adolf Hitler. In October 1934, Meinertzhagen claimed to have mocked Hitler in response to being &quot;baffled when Hitler raised his arm in the Nazi salute and said, &#x27;Heil Hitler.&#x27; After a moment&#x27;s thought, Meinertzhagen says he raised his own arm in an identical salute and proclaimed, &#x27;Heil Meinertzhagen&#x27;.&quot; He claimed to have carried a loaded pistol in his coat pocket at a meeting with Hitler and Ribbentrop in July 1939 and was &quot;seriously troubled&quot; about not shooting when he had the chance, adding &quot;... [I]f this war breaks out, as I feel sure it will, then I shall feel very much to blame for not killing these two.&quot;

Authors Lockman and Garfield show that Meinertzhagen later falsified his entries. The original diaries are kept at Rhodes House (the Bodleian Library), Oxford, and contain differences in the paper used for certain entries as well as in the typewriter ribbon used, and oddities exist in the page numbering.

===Dates of promotions===
* Second lieutenant on 18 January 1899
* Lieutenant on 8 February 1900
* Captain in February 1905
* Major in September 1915
* Brevet lieutenant colonel in March 1918
* Brevet colonel in August 1918.

Meinertzhagen retired with a major&#x27;s pension in 1925. Upon retirement, British officers are allowed to use the title of the highest rank held on active duty, thus he continued to be addressed as &quot;Colonel&quot;. In 1939, Meinertzhagen was reinstated as a lieutenant colonel for service during World War II. Appointed as a Military Intelligence officer, G.S.O.-3 (General Staff Officer, 3rd grade), his duties were confined mainly to public relations work.

==Character==

Meinertzhagen has inspired three biographies since his death in 1967. Early biographers largely lionized him as a grand elder statesman of espionage and ornithology.

T. E. Lawrence, a sometime colleague in 1919 and again 1921, described him more ambiguously and with due attention to his violence:

Meinertzhagen himself traced the &quot;evil&quot; side of his personality to a period during his childhood when he was subjected to severe physical abuse at the hands of a sadistic schoolmaster when he was at Fonthill boarding school in Sussex:

Gavin Maxwell wrote about how his parents would scare him and other children to behave themselves when Meinertzhagen visited with &quot;... remember ... he has killed people with his bare hands...&quot;

Salim Ali noted Meinertzhagen&#x27;s special hatred for Mahatma Gandhi and his refusal to believe that Indians could govern themselves.

In &quot;The Meinertzhagen Mystery&quot;, Garfield presents a fuller perspective of Meinertzhagen as not only a fraud, but also a murderer. The book argues many of Meinertzhagen&#x27;s accomplishments were myths, including the famous haversack incident, which Garfield claims Meinertzhagen neither came up with nor carried out. In another example, Garfield researched Meinertzhagen diary records, noting three meetings on separate dates with Adolf Hitler. Although Meinertzhagen was in Berlin on these dates in 1934, 1935, and 1939, Garfield found no record of any of these alleged meetings in surviving German chancellory records, British embassy files, British intelligence reports, or newspapers of the day.

Garfield&#x27;s research leads him to speculate that Richard also killed his second wife, Annie (born Anne Constance Jackson daughter of Major Randle Jackson of Swordale, married Meinertzhagen in 1921), an ornithologist, and that her death was not an accident as claimed and ruled in court. She died in 1928 at age 40 in a remote Scottish village in an incident that was officially ruled a shooting accident. The finding was that she accidentally shot herself in the head with a revolver during target practice alone with Richard, but Garfield argues Meinertzhagen shot her out of fear that she would expose him and his fraudulent activities. Storrs L. Olson has pointed out some errors in Garfield&#x27;s research, while confirming the validity of its overall negative tone.

Meinertzhagen has been referred to as a &quot;serial psychopath&quot; in relation to his acts in Kenya.

==Zoology==

As Garfield writes, &quot;From boyhood on, [Meinertzhagen] had been in tune with nature; he took photographs, made drawings, and provided armchair tourists with keen descriptions of rain forests and snowy mountains ... and discovered new (previously unrecorded) species of bats, birds, and &quot;mallophaga&quot; (bird lice)&quot;. In 1940, a genus of bird lice, &quot;Meinertzhageniella&quot;, was named after him by the German zoologist Wolfdietrich Eichler. He became a chairman of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club and a recipient in 1951 of the Godman-Salvin Medal; the British Museum (Natural History) named a room after him.

===Discoveries===
Meinertzhagen &quot;first achieved a sliver of international fame when he discovered, killed, stuffed, and shipped back to London the first known to Europeans giant African forest hog, soon dubbed &quot;Hylochoerus meinertzhageni&quot;, and attributed to Richard Meinertzhagen&quot;. At that time, while on active duty in 1903, he was &quot;fearlessly exploring and mapping areas no European had seen before.&quot;

He later also discovered the Afghan snowfinch or &quot;Montifringilla theresae&quot;, and the Moroccan &quot;Riparia rupestris theresae&quot; and named them, and ten others, after Theresa Clay.

===&quot;Nicoll&#x27;s Birds of Egypt&quot; (1930)===
He edited &quot;Nicoll&#x27;s Birds of Egypt&quot; in 1930. Michael J. Nicoll was a friend and assistant director of the Zoological Gardens at Giza; Nicoll attempted to write a comprehensive guide to the ornithology of Egypt, but died in 1925 before it could be published. The work was finished by Meinertzhagen with contributions of his own independent research and illustrations. It was printed with the title &quot;that seems appropriate,&quot; &quot;&quot;Nicoll&#x27;s Birds of Egypt&quot; by Col. R. Meinertzhagen.&quot;

===&quot;Birds of Arabia&quot; (1954); controversy===
In 1948–49, he was accompanied by Dr. Phillip Clancey on an ornithological expedition to Arabia, Yemen, Aden, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa. As the author of numerous taxonomic and other works on birds, and possessing a vast collection of bird and bird lice specimens, he was long considered one of Britain&#x27;s greatest ornithologists. Meinhertzhagen&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Birds of Arabia&quot; (1954), however made extensive use of the unpublished manuscript of another naturalist, George Bates, who has been insufficiently credited in the work.

===Fraud and theft===
In the 1990s, an analysis of Meinertzhagen&#x27;s bird collection at the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum in Tring, Hertfordshire, revealed large-scale fraud involving theft and falsification. The birds claimed as specimens collected by Meinertzhagen matched with the ones that had been reported missing and the examination of the style of specimen preparation and the DNA sequences of the cotton used inside them matched the cotton used in other specimens prepared by the collectors of the stolen specimens. This also corroborated hear-say and other evidence on the specimen fraud.

Many of the specimens that he submitted as his own were found to be missing samples belonging to the Natural History Museum and collected by others, such as Hugh Whistler. A species of owl, the forest owlet, thought to have gone extinct, was rediscovered in 1997 based on searches made in the locality where the original specimens were collected. Searches for the bird had failed before as these were made in a locality falsely claimed by Meinertzhagen. More research by Pamela C. Rasmussen and Robert Prŷs-Jones indicates the fraud was even more extensive than first thought.

==Personal life==
===First marriage===
In 1911, Meinertzhagen married Armorel, the daughter of Colonel Herman Le Roy-Lewis, who commanded the Hampshire Yeomanry. This marriage was dissolved in 1919.

===Second marriage===
In 1921, Meinertzhagen married Anne Constance Jackson, a fellow ornithologist and the daughter of Major Randle Jackson of Swordale, Ross-shire in Scotland. They had three children: Anne (born 1921), Daniel (born 1925), and Randle (born 1928). From about 1926, Meinertzhagen started to have a cold relationship with his wife and became increasingly close with his cousin Tess Clay, then aged 15, spending much time with her sisters and her.

In 1928, three months after the birth of Randle, Anne was killed, aged 40, at her birth village of Swordale. The finding, ruled in court, was that she accidentally shot herself in the head with a revolver during target practice alone with Richard. As noted above, Brian Garfield&#x27;s research led him to speculate that in fact she was murdered by Meinertzhagen, out of fear that she would expose him and his fraudulent activities. This idea was never conclusively proved or disproved.

Annie Constance Meinertzhagen left £113,466 (net personalty £18,733) in her will to her husband if he remained her widower, while if he remarried, he was to get an annuity of £1200 and interest in their London home for life.

===Later relationship===
Meinertzhagen never remarried; however he had a lasting relationship with Tess Clay, more than three decades his junior. The unmarried couple lived in Kensington in adjacent buildings originally constructed with an internal passage connecting the foyers of the two houses. Clay was his housekeeper, secretary, &quot;confidante&quot;, and later scientific partner who studied and eventually documented the vast collections of bird lice that Meinertzhagen had gathered.

When they travelled, they sometimes took separate rooms. He introduced her as his housekeeper or cousin or sometimes, inaccurately, as his niece. If Meinertzhagen and Clay&#x27;s relationship was physical is unknown; Meinertzhagen&#x27;s friend Victor Rothschild asked Meinertzhagen this outright, but was told &quot;in no uncertain terms to shut up&quot;; and a 1951 article in &quot;Time&quot; referred to their relationship with &quot;wink-wink, nudge-nudge innuendo&quot;.

==Legacy==
He was played by Anthony Andrews in the film &quot;The Lighthorsemen&quot; (1987).

<text>Watsonia is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 16 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Banyule local government area. Watsonia recorded a population of 5,352 at the .

==History==

Watsonia originally belonged to the Wurundjeri people. It is named after early property developer and landowner Frank Watson.

Watsonia was surveyed by Robert Hoddle in 1838 as part of the parish of Keelbundora, for subdivisional sale as farms. Until the 1870s, much of Watsonia remained part of the vast property holdings of John Brown. The Grace Park area was purchased in 1877 by Frederick Augustus Nell, and then by Frank Watson in the early twentieth century. Watson subdivided the property for housing in 1924. The area remained primarily rural until the 1940s, when property prices became affordable.

Watson and other local landowners paid for the establishment of a railway station in order to attract property buyers. Subdivision commenced with the sale of 44 allotments from the Grace Park Estate, next to the new railway station, in June 1924. Watsonia railway station was named after Mr. F. Watson and was opened on Monday 23 June 1924, between the existing Macleod and Greensborough Stations. It was initially intended to be called Collins. Watsonia Post Office opened around 1934.

In 1931, 40 acres of land at Watsonia was purchased to build a novitiate for the Jesuit Order of the Roman Catholic Church. November 1932, a foundation stone was laid for the construction of a Jesuit seminary. The studies and retreat house was opened in 1934. In 1974, the Watsonia Institure of social welfare opened on the site. Months later plans to use the site as a periodic detention centre were rejected by the local community. In 1979, the land was donated to the Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) for the purpose of building a Catholic secondary school. Loyola College was established in 1980 and is set on 27 acres. It is a member of the Ignatian Network, a group of Jesuit and non-Jesuit schools worldwide.
In 1973 Concord School opened in Grimshaw Street, a specialist school.

Watsonia Station is in Zone 2 on the Hurstbridge railway line and is currently served by Metro Trains Melbourne. The North East Link Project will impact Watsonia, with a tunnel being constructed from Watsonia to Bulleen. There will also be a new tree-lined Greensborough Road boulevard from Watsonia to Rosanna.

Loyola College Alumni Association organise an annual classic car show.

78.0% of Watsonia residents were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth other than Australia are England 2.3%, China (excluding SARs and Taiwan) 2.0%, India 1.3%, Italy 1.0% and Sri Lanka 0.8%.

==Landmarks==

The Simpson Army Barracks, Yallambie was originally known as the Watsonia Military Camp during World War II. This complex was built on the property formerly owned by Ainslie Meares. In 1951, surrounding land was purchased for the extension of the barracks.

Local schools include Watsonia Primary School, Greensborough College and Loyola College.

<doc id="653741" wikidata="Q1326617" url="?curid=653741" title="FreeType">
<text>FreeType is a software development library used to render text onto bitmaps, and which provides support for other font-related operations. The FreeType font rasterization engine is free and open-source software with the source code dual-licensed under a BSD-like license and the GPL. FreeType supports a number of font formats, including TrueType, Type 1, and OpenType.

==History==
The FreeType rendering engine was started in 1995 by David Turner with the intent to provide TrueType font support for the OS/2 operating system, including an interpreter for handling TrueType bytecode. Originally written in the Pascal programming language, it was ported in 1997 by Robert Wilhelm to C.

FreeType 1 had support only for the TrueType font format, but it included an extension to support OpenType text layout features.

===Major rewrite 2.0===
Version 2.0 of FreeType was a complete rewrite to make it more modular. FreeType 2 brought support for more font formats and an evolved source code which the developers stated was &quot;simpler and more powerful&quot;. FreeType 2 is not backward-compatible with FreeType 1 but the developers stated that moving from FreeType 1 to FreeType 2 poses little difficulty. As &quot;text layout processing&quot; was not an objective of FreeType 2, however, the OpenType text layout functionality of FreeType 1 was removed in FreeType 2. A very evolved form of the OpenType text layout functionality of FreeType 1 is used in the Pango text layout library. The HarfBuzz project is further evolving that functionality with a complete rewrite offered as a standalone library with a less restrictive license than Pango&#x27;s license.

===Patent conflicts===
In 1999, the Freetype project was informed by Apple Incorporated that FreeType was infringing patents related to TrueType font hinting. Following that, Freetype deactivated by default or worked around patent relating technologies. Therefore, several open source projects, such as FreeBSD or Linux, had FreeType included with font hinting functionality disabled or degraded to avoid the issue of software patents held by Apple Inc.

Since May 2010, all conflicting software patents related to font hinting have expired, allowing FreeType&#x27;s TrueType font hinter to be used in open source. Many of the operating systems which disabled the renderer now give the user the option to enable it. In Fedora, freetype-freeworld was switched from the proprietary yum repository to the free repository.

Since August 2019, all conflicting software patents related to ClearType color filtering have expired, allowing FreeType to use ClearType color filtering method in 2.10.3.

===Compact Font Format engine donation===
In 2013 Adobe donated a Compact Font Format rendering engine to the FreeType project which integrated it and made it the default with version 2.5.

==Users==
FreeType is used as a font renderer in Android, ChromeOS. Apple uses FreeType in iOS and macOS next to Apple Advanced Typography. In 2007, Sun Microsystems switched from using a proprietary font rasterizer to using FreeType in the OpenJDK Java development kit. On Windows, projects like gdipp and MacType aim to override the system renderer with FreeType. FreeType is also used as a font renderer in ReactOS.

As well as being used by the major free software desktop systems, FreeType has been used as a rasterization engine for some modern video games, and Opera for the Wii. Sony ships FreeType with its PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita consoles.

<doc id="653744" wikidata="Q5600611" url="?curid=653744" title="1973 Greater London Council election">
<text>The fourth election to the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) was held on 12 April 1973. Labour won a large majority of 58 seats to 32 for the Conservatives; the Liberals also won their first two seats on the council.

==Electoral arrangements==
As there had been a boundary commission report with new Parliamentary constituencies which coincided with the border of Greater London, the electoral system was changed (as had always been intended) so that the GLC was elected from single member electoral divisions which were identical with the Parliamentary constituencies. 

Councillors were elected for a three-year term. This was extended for an extra year in 1976 when the electoral cycle was switched to four-yearly.

==By-elections 1973–1977==

The first by-election of the term was caused by the court voiding the election in Croydon North East (see &quot;Morgan v Simpson&quot;). The former Conservative member Billie Morgan regained the seat she had narrowly lost in Croydon North East on 5 September 1974. Labour retained seats in Greenwich on 24 October 1974 and Dagenham on 30 January 1975 caused by the deaths of sitting councillors. The Conservatives kept their seat in Finchley on 15 May 1975 caused by the resignation of Roland Freeman and St Marylebone on 8 April 1976 caused by the resignation of former GLC leader Desmond Plummer.

There was one aldermanic by-election caused by the resignation of Oliver Piers Stutchbury (Labour) in 1976. Alfred Frederick Joseph Chorley (Labour) was elected by the council on 21 September 1976, to serve until 1977.

<text>Byculla (ISO: Bhāykhaḷā; pronunciation: ) is an area of South Mumbai.

==Location==
Byculla is neighboured by Nagpada and Mumbai Central and Mahalaxmi on the west; Agripada, Jacob Circle on the north-west: Chinchpokli to the north; Madanpura in the centre; Reay Road and Ghodapdeo on the north-east; Mazagaon and Dockyard Road to the east; and Sandhurst Road and Bhendi Bazaar to the south.

Byculla falls under &quot;E&quot; Ward within the municipal limits of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation or BMC.

==History==
During the late 18th century, Byculla was an extension of Mazagaon, one of the seven islands that originally formed the city of Mumbai. The area was low-lying Flats inundated during the high tide through the Great Breach at Mahalaxmi. However, the breach was closed by the Hornby Vellard project in 1784, which joined all seven islands of Bombay into a single island. This was followed by the construction of the Bellasis Road causeway in 1793. Thereafter the area saw habitation as Europeans living in the Mazagaon area started shifting here. The Byculla Club was opened in 1833. Birthplace of Lady Patricia Helen Marie Rodrigues

The Byculla railway station was completed by 1857. This was also the time the first mills came into this area, until then, used only for residential purposes. Byculla used to house many of the city&#x27;s textile mills until the mills shut shop and moved out of the island city. As of today, few mills are operational and even they are on the brink of closure. Many of these old mills are now desolate and some are being razed down to make way for newer constructions. The Khatau Mills were situated in Byculla, in the news for the alleged murder of the owner Sunit Khatau in May 1994.

Byculla saw some horrible riots during 1936-37 rose during temple-mosque dispute.

==Transportation==
Byculla is well connected by Central Railway line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway via Byculla railway station, as well as bus routes serviced by BEST.

Most of the bus routes servicing South Mumbai, South-Central Mumbai, Central Mumbai and North-East Mumbai pass through Byculla. The resulting heavy traffic prompted city planners to develop major fly-overs in Byculla, as early as the 1980s.

Almost all local trains halt at Byculla railway station - meaning it is a halt station for the &#x27;Fast&#x27; local trains on Mumbai&#x27;s Central Railway line. Mumbai Central and Mahalakshmi on the Western Railway line and Dockyard Road and Reay Road stations on the Harbour Line of Mumbai Suburban Railway also lie close to Byculla.

Ferry Wharf, a major ferry servicing port is located at a small distance from Byculla, in the Dockyard Road locality.
Another fly-over built near the Gloria Church was in the news when there was a collapse of one of its portions during its construction in the 1980s.

<text>A wrinkle, also known as a rhytid, is a fold, ridge or crease in an otherwise smooth surface, such as on skin or fabric. Skin wrinkles typically appear as a result of ageing processes such as glycation, habitual sleeping positions, loss of body mass, sun damage, or temporarily, as the result of prolonged immersion in water. Age wrinkling in the skin is promoted by habitual facial expressions, aging, sun damage, smoking, poor hydration, and various other factors. In humans, it can also be prevented to some degree by avoiding excessive solar exposure and through diet (in particular through consumption of carotenoids, tocopherols and flavonoids, vitamins (A, C, D and E), essential omega-3-fatty acids, certain proteins and lactobacilli).

== Skin ==
=== Causes for aging wrinkles ===

Development of facial wrinkles is a kind of fibrosis of the skin. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that wrinkles develop from incorrect repairs of injured elastic fibers and collagen fibers. Repeated extensions and compressions of the skin cause repeated injuries of extracellular fibers in derma. During the repairing process, some of the broken elastic fibers and collagen fibers are not regenerated and restored but replaced by altered fibers. When an elastic fiber is broken in an extended state, it may be replaced by a &quot;long&quot; collagen fiber. Accumulation of &quot;long&quot; collagen fibers makes part of the skin looser and stiffer, and as a consequence, a big fold of skin appears. When a &quot;long&quot; collagen is broken in a compressed state, it may be replaced by a &quot;short&quot; collagen fiber. The &quot;shorter&quot; collagen fibers will restrict the extension of &quot;longer&quot; fibers, and make the “long&quot; fibers in a folding state permanently. A small fold, namely a permanent wrinkle, then appears.

=== Sleep wrinkles ===

Sleep wrinkles are created and reinforced when the face is compressed against a pillow or bed surface in side or stomach sleeping positions during sleep. They appear in predictable locations due to the underlying superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS), and are usually distinct from wrinkles of facial expression. As with wrinkles of facial expression, sleep wrinkles can deepen and become permanent over time, unless the habitual sleeping positions which cause the wrinkles are altered.

===Water-immersion wrinkling===

The wrinkles that occur in skin over prolonged exposure to water are sometimes referred to as &quot;pruney fingers&quot; or water aging. This is a temporary skin condition where the skin on the palms of the hand or feet becomes wrinkly. This wrinkling response may have imparted an evolutionary benefit by providing improved traction in wet conditions, and a better grasp of wet objects. These results were called into question by a 2014 study that failed to reproduce any improvement of handling wet objects with wrinkled fingertips. However, a 2020 study of gripping efficiency found that wrinkles decreased the force required to grip wet objects by 20%, supporting the traction hypothesis.

Prior to a 1935 study, the common explanation was based on water absorption in the keratin-laden epithelial skin when immersed in water, causing the skin to expand and resulting in a larger surface area, forcing it to wrinkle. Usually the tips of the fingers and toes are the first to wrinkle because of a thicker layer of keratin and an absence of hairs which secrete the protective oil called sebum.

In the 1935 study, however, Lewis and Pickering were studying patients with palsy of the median nerve when they discovered that skin wrinkling did not occur in the areas of the patients&#x27; skin normally innervated by the damaged nerve. This suggested that the nervous system plays an essential role in wrinkling, so the phenomenon could not be entirely explained simply by water absorption. Recent research shows that wrinkling is related to vasoconstriction. Water probably initiates the wrinkling process by altering the balance of electrolytes in the skin as it diffuses into the hands and soles via their many sweat ducts. This could alter the stability of the membranes of the many neurons that synapse on the many blood vessels underneath skin, causing them to fire more rapidly. Increased neuronal firing causes blood vessels to constrict, decreasing the amount of fluid underneath the skin. This decrease in fluid would cause a decrease in tension, causing the skin to become wrinkly.

This insight resulted in bedside tests for nerve damage and vasoconstriction. Wrinkling is often scored with immersion of the hands for 30 minutes in water or EMLA cream with measurements steps of 5 minutes, and counting the number of visible wrinkles in time. Not all healthy persons have finger wrinkling after immersion, so it would be safe to say that sympathetic function is preserved if finger wrinkling after immersion in water is observed, but if the
fingers emerge smooth it cannot be assumed that there is a lesion to the autonomic supply or to the peripheral nerves of the hand.

=== Other animals with wrinkles ===
Examples of wrinkles can be found in various animal species that grow loose, excess skin, particularly when they are young. Several breeds of dog, such as the Pug and the Shar Pei, have been bred to exaggerate this trait. In dogs bred for fighting, this is the result of selection for loose skin, which confers a protective advantage.

=== Techniques for reducing the appearance of aging wrinkles ===

Current evidence suggests that tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells, although the exact mode of action is unknown. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells. Tretinoin is better known by the brand name Retin-A.

Topical glycosaminoglycans supplements can help to provide temporary restoration of enzyme balance to slow or prevent matrix breakdown and consequent onset of wrinkle formation. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are produced by the body to maintain structural integrity in tissues and to maintain fluid balance. Hyaluronic acid is a type of GAG that promotes collagen synthesis, repair, and hydration. GAGs serve as a natural moisturizer and lubricant between epidermal cells to inhibit the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

Dermal fillers are injectable products frequently used to correct wrinkles, and other depressions in the skin. They are often a kind of soft tissue designed to enable injection into the skin for purposes of improving the appearance. The most common products are based on hyaluronic acid and calcium hydroxylapatite.

Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin protein produced by the bacterium &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;. Botox is a specific form of botulinum toxin manufactured by Allergan for both therapeutic and cosmetic use. Besides its cosmetic application, Botox is used in the treatment of other conditions including migraine headache and cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis) (a neuromuscular disorder involving the head and neck).

Dysport, manufactured by Ipsen, received FDA approval and is now used to treat cervical dystonia as well as glabellar lines in adults. In 2010, another form of botulinum toxin, one free of complexing proteins, became available to Americans. Xeomin received FDA approval for medical indications in 2010 and cosmetic indications in 2011.

Botulinum toxin treats wrinkles by immobilizing the muscles which cause wrinkles. It is not appropriate for the treatment of all wrinkles; it is indicated for the treatment of glabellar lines (between the eyebrows) in adults. Any other usage is not approved by the FDA and is considered off-label use.

Laser resurfacing is FDA-cleared skin resurfacing procedure in which lasers are used to improve the condition of the skin. Two types of lasers are used to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on the face; laser ablation, which removes thin layers of skin, and nonablative lasers that stimulate collagen production. Nonablative lasers are less effective than ablative ones but they are less invasive and recovery time is short. After the procedure people experience temporary redness, itching and swelling.

<text>Wotho Atoll (Marshallese: , ) is a coral atoll of 13 islands in the Pacific Ocean, and forms a legislative district of the Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands. Its total land area is only , but it encloses a lagoon of . The name &quot;Wotho&quot; means either &quot;entrance through the reef&quot;, or &quot;island far away&quot; according to different sources.

The population of Wotho Atoll was 88 at the 2021 census.

==History==
First recorded sighting of Wotho Atoll by Europeans was by the Spanish expedition of Miguel López de Legazpi on 12 January 1565. They were charted as &quot;Las Hermanas&quot; (The Sisters in Spanish). It is likely that it had been visited earlier, in between December 1542 and January 1543, by the Spanish expedition of Ruy López de Villalobos. The atoll was later also known as Schantz Islands after Johan Eberhard von Schantz, who rediscovered the islands on his circumnavigation of the globe on the Imperial Russian Navy ship &quot;America&quot; in 1835. Wotho Atoll was claimed by the German Empire along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1885. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. At the end of World War II, it came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986.


==Education==
Marshall Islands Public School System operates Wotho Elementary School. Kwajalein Atoll High School on Kwajalein serves the community.

<text>The fifth election to the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) was held on 5 May 1977. The Conservatives, led by Horace Cutler, gained control of the council from Labour.

==Electoral arrangements==
The GLC was elected from 92 single-member electoral divisions which were identical with the Parliamentary constituencies in Greater London. The election date was fixed by section 43 of the Local Government Act 1972 as the first Thursday in May. Councillors had been elected for a three-year term at previous elections, with those elected in 1973 having their terms extended to four years in 1976. From the 1977 election councillors were elected for a four-year term. All aldermen went out of office in 1977 and no further aldermen were elected by the council.

==Results==
The Conservative Party won a majority of seats at the election. The Liberal Party lost both of its councillors.

<doc id="653764" wikidata="Q1801121" url="?curid=653764" title="Lake of Menteith">
<text>Lake of Menteith, also known as Loch Inchmahome (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Loch Innis Mo Cholmaig&quot;), is a loch in Scotland located on the Carse of Stirling (the flood plain of the upper reaches of the rivers Forth and Teith, upstream from Stirling).

==Name==
Until the early 19th century, the loch was more commonly known by the Scottish name, “Loch of Menteith”, although, on the 1654 map, &quot;Blaeu Atlas of Scotland&quot;, it is identified as “Loch Inche Mahumo”. The only settlement of any size on the Loch of Menteith is the Port of Menteith.

==Geography==
There are a number of small islands in the loch. On the largest, Inchmahome, is Inchmahome Priory, an ancient monastery. The priory served as refuge to Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1547. She was only four years old at the time and stayed for three weeks after the disastrous Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in September of that year. The loch is not particularly deep and can freeze over completely in exceptionally cold winters. If the ice becomes thick enough, at least , an outdoor curling tournament called the Bonspiel (or the Grand Match) is held on the loch. The event can attract thousands of curlers even though it is held very infrequently. The last Grand Match was held in 1979. The Bonspiel that had been planned for 2010 was abandoned on health and safety grounds.
The Lake of Menteith is often thought of as the only body of water in Scotland that is referred to as a lake. Actually, there are several others, some of which have been artificially created: Pressmennan Lake, East Lothian; the Lake of the Hirsel, Berwickshire; Lake Louise (within the grounds of Skibo Castle, Sutherland); Raith Lake, Fife; Upper Lake and Kelly Lake (both near Haddo House, Aberdeenshire); Pitfour Lake and Cally Lake (near Gatehouse of Fleet, Kirkcudbrightshire). There is also a sea bay near Kirkcudbright known as Manxman&#x27;s Lake. Nearly all other major bodies of water in Scotland are known as lochs.

The unusual name “Lake of Menteith” is believed to be due to the UK Government&#x27;s Ordnance Survey in 1838 who mapped the area for the first time, and identified it as a “lake” because it was referred to as a lake in literature that was prominent at the time.

==Malling Roman Fort==

There was a Roman fort at a site associated with the Gask Ridge, to the west of the lake. The Romans may have referred to the site as &quot;Lindon&quot;. It was discovered by David Wilson and Kenneth St Joseph in 1968 when they were conducting an aerial survey of Flanders Moss. After taking aerial photographs, they assessed the site by measuring resistance and magnetic susceptibility at ground level.
==In popular culture==
In 2020, the lake was featured in the BBC programme &quot;Springwatch&quot;, presented by wildlife photographer Gordon Buchanan.

<text>The sixth election to the Greater London Council (GLC) was held on 7 May 1981. Following the election Andrew McIntosh the leader of the Labour Group was replaced by Ken Livingstone, a member of the party&#x27;s left-wing. This was the last election to the GLC. The Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher soon decided to abolish the council in the mid-1980s. Following the abolition of the GLC, there was a direct election to the Inner London Education Authority in 1986.

==Electoral arrangements==
The GLC was elected from 92 single-member electoral divisions which were identical with the Parliamentary constituencies in Greater London. The election date was fixed by section 43 of the Local Government Act 1972 as the first Thursday in May.

Councillors were elected for a four-year term. This was extended for an extra year in 1984 when the elections that had been scheduled for 1985 were cancelled.

==Results==
The leader of the Labour GLC group Andrew McIntosh led the party into the election. Within 24 hours of the result, however, McIntosh&#x27;s leadership was toppled by Ken Livingstone; a member of the party&#x27;s left-wing. Livingstone was then elected GLC leader. The results were as follows (all parties shown):

<text>Writer&#x27;s cramp or focal hand dystonia (FHD) is an idiopathic movement disorder of adult onset, characterized by abnormal posturing and movement of the hand and/or forearm during tasks requiring skilled hand use, such as writing. Overcontraction of affected muscles, cocontraction of agonist and antagonist pairs, and activation of muscles inappropriate to a task all impair use of the affected hand.

Writer&#x27;s cramp is a task-specific focal dystonia of the hand. &#x27;Focal&#x27; refers to the symptoms being limited to one location (the hand in this case), and &#x27;task-specific&#x27; means that symptoms first occur only when the individual engages in a particular activity. Writer&#x27;s cramp first affects an individual by interfering with their ability to write, especially for prolonged periods of time.

Epidemiologic studies report a prevalence of 7–69 per million population for writer&#x27;s cramp, which explains its recognition as a rare disease, like all other forms of dystonia.

==Symptoms and signs==
Onset usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years and often starts with a feeling of tension in fingers and forearms that interferes with writing fluency.

More specifically, early symptoms may include loss of precision muscle coordination (sometimes first manifested in declining penmanship, frequent small injuries to the hands, dropped items and a noticeable increase in dropped or chipped dishes), cramping pain with sustained use and trembling. Significant muscle pain and cramping may result from very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages. It may become difficult to find a comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome. Affected persons may notice trembling in the diaphragm while breathing, or the need to place hands in pockets, under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain. Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down, and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth, or symptoms similar to TMD. The voice may crack frequently or become harsh, triggering frequent throat clearing. Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping. Patients may also present with varying degree of disability and symptoms, such as experiencing more difficulty writing down-stroke as compared to writing upstroke.

Electrical sensors (EMG) inserted into affected muscle groups, while painful, can provide a definitive diagnosis by showing pulsating nerve signals being transmitted to the muscles even when they are at rest. The brain appears to signal portions of fibers within the affected muscle groups at a firing speed of about 10 Hz causing them to pulsate, tremble and contort. When called upon to perform an intentional activity, the muscles fatigue very quickly and some portions of the muscle groups do not respond (causing weakness) while other portions over-respond or become rigid (causing micro-tears under load). The symptoms worsen significantly with use, especially in the case of focal dystonia, and a &quot;mirror effect&quot; is often observed in other body parts: use of the right hand may cause pain and cramping in that hand as well as in the other hand and legs that were not being used. Stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, sustained use and cold temperatures can worsen symptoms.

Direct symptoms may be accompanied by secondary effects of the continuous muscle and brain activity, including disturbed sleep patterns, exhaustion, mood swings, mental stress, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision, digestive problems and short temper. People with dystonia may also become depressed and find great difficulty adapting their activities and livelihood to a progressing disability. Side effects from treatment and medications can also present challenges in normal activities.

In some cases, symptoms may progress and then plateau for years, or stop progressing entirely. The progression may be delayed by treatment or adaptive lifestyle changes, while forced continued use may make symptoms progress more rapidly. In others, the symptoms may progress to total disability, making some of the more risky forms of treatment worth considering in the future.

==Causes==
Although the cause of writer&#x27;s cramp is not well known, it was historically believed to be the result of excessive fine motor activity, possibly complicated by a tense or otherwise inappropriate writing technique. More recently, Karin Rosenkranz et al. have suggested that this is not necessarily the case.

Recent studies point out that there appears to be a genetic component to focal hand dystonia (FHD). In fact, up to 20% of those with writer&#x27;s cramp have a family member with some form of dystonia.

Musician&#x27;s cramp (a similar focal dystonia which affects less than 1% of instrumentalists) has historically been grouped together with writer&#x27;s cramp because of this and their common task-specificity. Rosenkranz et al. have more recently identified significant differences between the two populations, however. No matter exactly how it arises, researchers generally agree that these types of focal dystonia are the result of a basal ganglia and/or sensorimotor cortex malfunction in the brain.

==Treatment==
Although dystonias may be induced by chemical exposure/ingestion, brain injury, or hereditary/genetic predisposition, the task-specific focal dystonias such as writer&#x27;s cramp are a unique challenge to diagnose and treat. Some cases may respond to chemical injections - botulinum toxin (botox) is often cited, though it is not helpful in all cases. Behavioral retraining attempts may include writing devices, switching hands, occupational therapy, biofeedback, constraint-induced motion therapy, and others. Some writing instruments allow variations of pressure application for use. None of these are effective in all cases, however. The work of Dr. Joaquin Farias has shown that proprioceptive stimulation can induce neuroplasticity, making it possible for patients to recover substantial function that was lost from focal dystonia.

Anticholinergics such as Artane can be prescribed for off-label use, as some patients have had success.
