<text>Reduction mammoplasty (also breast reduction and reduction mammaplasty) is the plastic surgery procedure for reducing the size of large breasts. In a breast reduction surgery for re-establishing a functional bust that is proportionate to the patient&#x27;s body, the critical corrective consideration is the tissue viability of the nipple–areola complex (NAC), to ensure the functional sensitivity and lactational capability of the breasts. The indications for breast reduction surgery are three-fold – physical, aesthetic, and psychological – the restoration of the bust, of the patient&#x27;s self-image, and of the patient&#x27;s mental health.

In corrective practice, the surgical techniques and praxis for reduction mammoplasty also are applied to mastopexy (breast lift).

==Presentation==
The patient with macromastia presents heavy, enlarged breasts that sag and cause chronic pains to the head, neck, shoulders, and back; an oversized bust also causes secondary health problems, such as poor blood circulation, impaired breathing (inability to fill the lungs with air); chafing of the skin of the chest and the lower breast (inframammary intertrigo); brassière-strap indentations to the shoulders; and the improper fit of clothes.

In the patient affected by gigantomastia (&gt;1,000 gm overweight per breast), the average breast-volume reduction diminished the oversized bust by three brassière cup-sizes. The surgical reduction of abnormally enlarged breasts resolves the physical symptoms and the functional limitations imposed by a bodily disproportionate bust; thereby, it improves a patient&#x27;s physical and mental health. Afterwards, the patient&#x27;s ability to comfortably perform physical activities previously impeded by oversized breasts improves emotional health (self-esteem) by reducing anxiety and lessening psychological depression.

===Medical history===
The medical history records the patient&#x27;s age, the number of children the patient has borne, the patient&#x27;s breast-feeding practices, plans for pregnancy and nursing of the infant, medication allergies, and tendency to bleeding. Additional to the personal medical information are the patient&#x27;s history of tobacco smoking and concomitant diseases, breast-surgery and breast-disease histories, family history of breast cancer, and complaints of neck, back, shoulder pain, breast sensitivity, rashes, infection, and upper extremity numbness.

The physical examination records and establishes the accurate measures of the patient&#x27;s body mass index, vital signs, the mass of each breast, the degree of inframammary intertrigo present, the degree of breast ptosis, the degree of enlargement of each breast, lesions to the skin envelope, the degree of sensation in the nipple–areola complex (NAC), and discharges from the nipple. Also noted are the secondary effects of the enlarged breasts, such as shoulder-notching by the brassière strap from the breast weight, kyphosis (excessive, backwards curvature of the thoracic region of the spinal column), skin irritation, and skin rash affecting the breast crease (IMF).

===Cause===
Large breasts are usually developed during thelarche (the pubertal breast-development stage), but they can also develop postpartum, after gaining weight, at menopause, and at any age. Macromastia usually develops in consequence to the hypertrophy (overdevelopment) of adipose fat, rather than to milk-gland hypertrophy. Moreover, many are genetically predisposed to developing large breasts, the size and weight of which are often increased, either by pregnancy, by weight gain, or by both conditions; there also exist iatrogenic (physician-caused) conditions such as post–mastectomy and post–lumpectomy asymmetry. Nonetheless, it is statistically rare for a young person to experience virginal mammary hypertrophy that results in massive, oversized breasts, and recurrent breast hypertrophy.

The abnormal enlargement of the breast tissues to a volume in excess of the normal bust-to-body proportions can be caused either by the overdevelopment of the milk glands or of the adipose tissue, or by a combination of both occurrences of hypertrophy. The resultant breast-volume increases can range from the mild (&lt;300 gm) to the moderate (ca. 300–800 gm) to the severe (&gt;800 gm). Macromastia can be manifested either as a unilateral condition or as a bilateral condition (single-breasted enlargement or double-breasted enlargement) that can occur in combination with sagging, breast ptosis that is determined by the degree to which the nipple has descended below the inframammary fold (IMF).

===Therapeutic approaches===

====Medical====
Breast hypertrophy (macromastia and gigantomastia) does not respond to medical therapy, but a weight-reduction regimen for the certain patients can alleviate some of the excessive size and volume of abnormally enlarged breasts. Physical therapy provides some relief for neck, back, or shoulder pain. Skin care will diminish breast crease inflammation and lessen the symptoms caused by moisture, such as irritation, chafing, infection, and bleeding.

====Surgical====
The traditional surgical techniques for breast reduction remodel the breast mound using a skin and glandular (breast tissue) pedicle (inferior, superior, central), and then trim and re-drape the skin envelope into a new breast of natural size, shape, and contour; it produces long surgical scars upon the breast hemisphere. In response, L. Benelli, in 1990, presented the round block mammoplasty, a minimal-scar periareolar incision technique that produces only a periareolar scar – around the NAC, where the dark-to-light skin-color transition hides the surgical scar.

==Anatomy of the breast==

===The procedure===
A reduction mammoplasty to re-size enlarged breasts and to correct breast ptosis resects (cuts and removes) excess tissues (glandular, adipose, skin), overstretched suspensory ligaments, and transposes the NAC higher upon the breast hemisphere. During puberty, the breast grows in consequence to the influences of the hormones estrogen and progesterone; as a mammary gland, the breast is composed of lobules of glandular tissue, each of which is drained by a lactiferous duct that empties to the nipple. Most of the volume (ca. 90%) and rounded contour of the breasts are conferred by the adipose fat interspersed amongst the lobules, except during pregnancy and lactation, when breast milk constitutes most of the breast volume.

===Composition===
Surgically, the breast is an apocrine gland overlaying the chest – attached at the nipple and suspended with ligaments from the chest – which is integral to the skin, the body integument of the individual. The dimensions and weight of the breasts vary with age and habitus (body build and physical constitution); hence, small-to-medium-sized breasts weigh approximately 500 gm, or less, and large breasts weigh approximately 750–1,000 gm. Anatomically, the breast topography and the hemispheric locale of the NAC are particular to each individual; thus, the desirable, average measurements are a 21–23 cm sternal distance (nipple to sternum-bone notch), and a 5–7 cm inferior-limb distance (NAC to IMF).

===Blood supply and innervation===
The arterial blood supply of the breast has medial and lateral vascular components; it is supplied with blood by the internal mammary artery (from the medial aspect), the lateral thoracic artery (from the lateral aspect), and the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th intercostal perforating arteries. Drainage of venous blood from the breast is by the superficial vein system under the dermis, and by the deep vein system parallel to the artery system. The primary lymph drainage system is the retromammary lymph plexus in the pectoral fascia. Sensation in the breast is established by the peripheral nervous system innervation of the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the 4th, 5th, and 6th intercostal nerves, and thoracic spinal nerve 4 (T4 nerve) innervates and supplies sensation to the NAC.

===Mechanical structures of the breast===
In realizing the breast-reduction corrections, the plastic surgeon takes anatomic and histologic account of the biomechanical, load-bearing properties of the glandular, adipose, and skin tissues that compose and support the breast; among the properties of the soft tissues of the breast is near-incompressibility (Poisson&#x27;s ratio of ~0.5).

# Rib cage. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs of the thoracic cage are the structural supports for the mammary glands.
# Chest muscles. The breasts overlay the pectoralis major muscle, the pectoralis minor muscle, and the intercostal muscles (between the ribs), and can extend to and cover a portion of the (front) anterior serratus muscle (attached to the ribs, the rib muscles, and the shoulder blade), and to the rectus abdominis muscle (a long, flat muscle extending up the torso, from pubic bone to rib cage). The body posture of the patient exerts physical stresses upon the pectoralis major muscles and the pectoralis minor muscles, which cause the weight of the breasts to induce static and dynamic shear forces (when standing and when walking), compression forces (when lying supine), and tension forces (when kneeling on four limbs).
# Pectoralis fascia. The pectoralis major muscle is covered with a thin superficial membrane, the pectoral fascia, which has many prolongations intercalated among its fasciculi (fascicles); at the midline, it is attached to the front of the sternum, above it is attached to the clavicle (collar bone), while laterally and below, it is continuous with the fascia.
# Suspensory ligaments. The subcutaneous layer of adipose tissue in the breast is traversed with thin suspensory ligaments (Cooper&#x27;s ligaments) that extend obliquely to the skin surface, and from the skin to the deep pectoral fascia. The structural stability provided by the Cooper&#x27;s ligaments derives from its closely packed bundles of collagen fibers oriented in parallel; the principal, ligament-component cell is the fibroblast, interspersed throughout the parallel collagen-fiber bundles of the shoulder, axilla, and thorax ligaments.
# Glandular tissue. As a mammary gland, the breast comprises lobules (milk glands at each lobe-tip) and the lactiferous ducts (milk passages), which widen to form an ampulla (sac) at the nipple.
# Adipose tissue. The fat tissue of the breast is composed of lipidic fluid (60–85% weight) that is 90–99 per cent triglycerides, free fatty acids, diglycerides, cholesterol phospholipids, and minute quantities of cholesterol esters, and monoglycerides; the other components are water (5–30% weight) and protein (2–3% weight).
# Fatty tissue. In biology, adipose tissue (/ˈædəˌpoʊs/), or body fat, fat depot, or just fat, is loose connective tissue composed of adipocytes. It is technically composed of roughly only 80% fat; fat in its solitary state exists in the liver and muscles. Adipose tissue is derived from lipoblasts. Its main role is to store energy in the form of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, adipose tissue has in recent years been recognized as a major endocrine organ[1], as it produces hormones such as leptin, resistin, and the cytokine TNFα. Moreover, adipose tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of body fat – to be specific, adipose tissue. Two types of adipose tissue exist: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene. Adipose tissue was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.
# The skin envelope. The breast skin is in three layers: (i) the epidermis, (ii) the dermis, and (iii) the hypodermis. The epidermis is 50–100 μm thick, and is composed of a stratum corneum of flat keratin cells, that is 10–20 μm thick; it protects the underlying viable epidermis, which is composed of keratinizing epithelial cells. The dermis is mostly collagen and elastin fibers embedded to a viscous water and glycoprotein medium. The fibers of the upper dermis (&quot;papillary dermis&quot;) are thinner than the fibers of the deep dermis, thus the skin envelope is 1–3 mm thick. The thickness of the hypodermis (adipocyte cells) varies between individuals, and between body parts. The skin of the nipple and areola is further composed of a modified and specialized myoepithelium that is responsible for contraction in response to stimuli.

==Surgical procedures==

===General===
Reduction mammoplasty, either surgery or lipectomy, proportionately re-sizes the enlarged, sagging breasts of a patient affected with macromastia (&gt;500 gm increase per breast) or with gigantomastia (&gt;1,000 gm increase per breast). Breast reduction surgery has two technical aspects: (i) the skin-incision pattern and the skin- and glandular-tissue excision technique applied for access to and removal of breast parenchyma tissue. The incision pattern and the area of skin-envelope tissue to be removed determine the locales and the lengths of the surgical scars; (ii) the final shape and contour of the reduced breast are determined by the area of the tissues remaining in the breast, and that the skin- and glandular-tissue pedicle has a proper supply of nerves and blood vessels (arterial and venous) that ensure its tissue viability.

The specific reduction mammoplasty procedure is determined by the volume of breast tissues (glandular, adipose, skin) to be resected (cut and removed) from each breast, and the degree of breast ptosis present: Pseudoptosis (sagging of the inferior pole of the breast; the nipple is at or above the inframammary fold); Grade I: Mild ptosis (the nipple is below the IMF, but above the lower pole of the breast); Grade II: Moderate ptosis (the nipple is below the IMF; yet some lower-pole breast tissue hangs lower than the nipple); Grade III: Severe ptosis (the nipple is far below the IMF; no breast tissue is below the nipple). The full, corrective outcome of the surgical re-establishment of a bodily proportionate bust becomes evident at 6-months to 1-year post-operative, during which period the reduced and lifted breast tissues settle upon and into the chest. The post-operative convalescence is weeks long, depending upon the corrections performed; and some patients may experience painful breast-enlargement during the first post-operative menstruation.

====Contraindications====
Breast reduction surgery cannot be performed if the patient is lactating, or has recently ceased lactating; if the patient&#x27;s breasts contain unevaluated tissue masses, or unidentified microcalcifications; if the patient has a systemic illness; if the patient is unable to understand the technical limitations of the plastic surgery; or, if the patient cannot accept the possible medical complications of the procedure. Additionally, recent research has indicated that mammograms should not be done with any increased frequency in patients undergoing breast surgery, including breast augmentation, mastopexy, and breast reduction.

====I. Inferior pedicle technique (anchor pattern, inverted-T incision, Wise pattern)====
The inferior pedicle (central mound) features a blood vessel supply (arterial and venous) for the NAC from an inferior, centrally-based attachment to the chest wall. The skin pedicle maintains the innervation and vascular viability of the NAC, which produces a reduced, sensitive breast with full lactational capability and function. The volume and size reduction of hypertrophied breasts is performed with a periareolar incision to the NAC, which then extends downwards, following the natural curve of the breast hemisphere. After cutting and removing the requisite quantities of tissue (glandular, adipose, skin), the NAC is transposed higher upon the breast hemisphere; thereby, the inferior pedicle technique produces an elevated bust with breasts that are proportionate to the patients&#x27;s person. Breast-reduction with an inferior pedicle occasionally produces breasts that appear squared; despite this, the technique effectively reduces the very enlarged breasts of macromastia and gigantomastia.

====II. Vertical scar technique (lollipop incision)====
The breast reduction performed with the vertical-scar technique usually produces a well-projected bust featuring breasts with short incision scars and a NAC elevated by means of a pedicle (superior, medial, lateral) that maintains the biologic and functional viability of the NAC. The increased projection of the reduced bust is achieved by medially gathering the folds of the skin-envelope and suturing the inner and outer portions of the remaining breast gland to provide a support pillar, and upward projection of the NAC . The vertical-scar reduction mammoplasty is best suited for removing small areas of the skin envelope and small volumes of internal tissues (glandular, adipose) from the lateral and the inferior portions of the breast hemisphere; thus the short incision scars.

====III. Horizontal scar technique====
The breast reduction performed with the horizontal-scar technique features a horizontal incision along the inframammary fold (IMF) and a NAC pedicle. To elevate the NAC, the technique usually employs either an inferior pedicle or an inferior-lateral pedicle, and features no vertical incision (like the anchor pattern). The horizontal-scar technique best applies to the patient whose oversized breasts are too large for a vertical-incision technique (e.g. the lollipop pattern); and it has two therapeutic advantages: no vertical incision-scar to the breast hemisphere, and better healing of the periareolar scar of the transposed NAC. The potential disadvantages are box-shaped breasts with thick (hypertrophied) incision scars, especially at the inframammary fold.

====IV. Free nipple-graft technique====
The breast reduction performed with the free nipple-graft technique transposes the NAC as a tissue graft without a blood supply, without a skin and glandular pedicle. The therapeutic advantage is the greater volume of breast tissues (glandular, adipose, skin) that can be resected to produce a proportionate breast. The therapeutic disadvantage is a breast without a sensitive NAC, and without lactational capability. The medically indicated candidates are: the patient whose health presents a high risk of ischemia (localized tissue anemia) of the NAC, which can cause tissue necrosis; the diabetic patient; the patient who is a tobacco smoker; the patient whose oversized breasts have an approximate NAC-to-IMF measure of 20 cm; and the patient who has macromastia, requiring much resecting of the breast tissues.

====V. Liposuction-only technique (lipectomy)====
The breast reduction performed with the liposuction-only technique usually applies to the patient whose oversized breasts require the removal of a medium volume of internal tissue, and to the patient whose health precludes the extended anaesthesia typical of surgical breast-reduction operations. The ideal lipectomy candidate is the patient whose low-density breasts are principally composed of adipose tissue, have a relatively elastic skin envelope, and manifest mild ptosis. The therapeutic advantages of the liposuction-only technique are the small incision-scars required for access to the breast interior; hence, a shorter post-operative healing period for the incision scars. The therapeutic disadvantage is limited breast-reduction volumes.

==Surgical techniques==

===Pre-operative matters===

The medical treatment records for the reduction mammoplasty are established with pre-operative, multi-perspective photographs of the oversized breasts, the sternal-notch–to-nipple distances, and the nipple-to–inframammary-fold distances. The patient is instructed about the purposes of the breast reduction surgery; the achievable corrections; the expected final size, shape, and contour of the reduced breasts; the expected final appearance of the breast reduction scars; possible changes in the sensation of the NAC; possible changes in breast-feeding capability; and possible medical complications. The patient also is instructed about post-operative matters, such as convalescence, and the proper care of the surgical wounds to the breasts.

Incision-plan delineation: to the breasts of the standing patient, the plastic surgeon delineates the mosque dome skin-incision plan, and the area representing the superior pedicle (composed of skin and glandular tissues), the breast midline, the inframammary fold (IMF), and the vertical axis of the breast, beneath the IMF. The upper edge of the (future) NAC is marked slightly below the IMF-level, and a semicircle of 16-cm maximum diameter. In relation to the vertical axis, the mosque dome incision plan displaces the breast to the middle and to the side; the peripheral limbs of the incision plan are marked so that they approximate (join) at no less than 5-cm above the inframammary fold. The circumference of the (future) NAC is delineated around the nipple, and a superior pedicle (10-cm wide minimum) is delineated at the upper-border of the future NAC circumference; the incision-plan delineation continues down as a cone, and around the marked circumference.

===Operative technique===

The patient is laid supine upon the operating table so that the surgeon can later raise them to a sitting position that will allow visual comparison of the drape of the breasts, and an accurate assessment of the post-operative symmetry of the reduced and lifted bust. Afterwards, the pedicle epidermis surrounding the NAC is cut, and adipose tissue is liposuctioned from the breast. The medial, lower, and lateral segments of the breast are resected (cut and removed), by undermining the skin below the lower curved line. Then, the NAC is transposed higher upon the breast hemisphere. The pillars of parenchymal tissue are approximated (joined), and the skin envelope is sutured. 
There is no evidence to support using drains during breast reduction surgery.

===Notes===

* Biological: The resected tissue is submitted to histopathologic examination, because sub-clinical breast cancer foci occur in 0.1–0.9 per cent of the tissue specimens.
* Technical: The original Lejour technique incision plan had no horizontal limbs, and so did not produce horizontal scars; however, contemporary variants, such as the Modified Lejour Technique, employ small, horizontal incisions along the inframammary fold, in order to avoid redundant skin folds, especially in the reduction of very oversized breasts.

===Post-operative matters===

The patient is instructed to resume normal life activities, and to eat a light diet, post-operative, on the day of the breast reduction surgery; to resume washing in a shower at 1-day post-operative; to avoid strenuous physical activity, and to wear a sports brassière; the convalescence regimen is for three-months post-operative. The patient is also informed that the wrinkles at the bottom of the vertical limb of the scar usually resolve and fade within one–six months post-operative, but some cases may require surgical revision of the vertical scar. Scheduled follow-up consultations ensure a satisfactory outcome to the breast reduction surgery, and facilitate the early identification and management of medical complications.

Limited evidence shows no significant benefit in the use of wound drains after reduction mammoplasty.

===Complications===

The post-operative complications occurred include seroma, wound dehiscence, hematoma; partial NAC necrosis occurred in 10 per cent of the reduced breasts, but, after refinement of the Lejour technique, the study &quot;Vertical Mammaplasty: Early Complications After 250 Personal Consecutive Cases&quot; (1999) reported a reduced incidence rate of 7.0 percent in the 324 breast reductions performed in 167 patients. Moreover, the incidence of such post-operative complications is greater among the patients whose breasts required large-volume resection of the parenchyma; in patients who were obese; in patients who were tobacco smokers; and in young patients. Furthermore, wound dehiscence, epidermolysis, adipose tissue necrosis, and infection occur less among patients who undergo Lejour-technique breast reduction than among patients who undergo a periareolar, anchor pattern breast-reduction, or an inferior-pedicle breast reduction, however complication rates are significantly higher rate when the body mass index is greater than 30 kg/m. Nonetheless, bottom-edge asymmetry occurs more among Lejour-technique patients; the revision surgery rates can be up to 10 percent. Moreover, the liposuctioning of the breast does not increase the rate of local medical complications; decreased NAC sensitivity occurs in 10 percent of patients, and total NAC insensitivity occurs in 1.0 per cent of women.

===Liposuction-only technique===

The reliability of the lipectomy procedure was confirmed in two studies. The first, &quot;Tumescent Technique, Tumescent Anesthesia &amp; Microcannular Liposuction&quot; (2000), reported that tumescent liposuction is a reliable reduction mammoplasty procedure, which yields consistent results of size, appearance, and texture of the reduced-volume breasts. The second study by Daniel Lanzer, &quot;Breast Reduction with Liposuction&quot; (2002), about a 250-patient cohort, reported that the application of tumescent liposuction, as the sole reduction-mammoplasty procedure, yielded consistent results wherein none of the patients had loose breast-skin envelopes, irregular breast-shape, permanent loss of sensation (either glandular, dermal, or of the NAC), scars, tissue necrosis, or infection.

After fat cells are suctioned away via liposuction, it was quoted in the Obesity journal that overall body fat generally returned to the same level as before treatment, despite maintaining the previous diet and exercise regimen. While the fat returned somewhat to the treated area, most of the increased fat occurred in the abdominal area. Visceral fat - the fat surrounding the internal organs - increased, and this condition has been linked to life-shortening diseases such as diabetes, stroke, and heart attack.

====Indications====
The reduction of oversized breasts by liposuction only (lipectomy) is indicated when a minor-to-moderate volume-reduction is required, and there is no breast ptosis to correct. However, in a 2001 study of 250 patients, nipple and breast elevation of between 3 cm and 15 cm was reported. Further indications for lipectomy are presented by: (i) the patient who requires a large-volume reduction, and wants un-scarred, sensate breasts, but will accept a degree of ptosis; (ii) the patient who requires a secondary mammoplasty to correct an asymmetric breast, by up to one brassière cup-size; and (iii) the patient affected by virginal breast hypertrophy, as a temporary procedure performed before the conclusion of thelarche (the pubertal breast-growth phase), given the hypertrophy&#x27;s high rate of recurrence.

====Contraindications====
Breast reduction by liposuction only cannot be performed upon a patient whose mammogram indicates that the oversized breast is principally composed of hypertrophied milk glands. Furthermore, liposuction mammoplasty also is contraindicated for any patient whose mammograms indicate the presence of unevaluated neoplasms; likewise, the presence of a great degree of breast ptosis, and an inelastic skin envelope.

====Pre-operative matters====
Consultation: the plastic surgeon evaluates the elasticity of the skin envelope of each breast, and determines the degree of breast ptosis present. The patient is informed of the alternative, surgical reduction techniques available for diminishing oversized breasts; of the consequent surgical scars; of the possible loss of breast sensation; of the possible impairment of lactation capability; and of the possible impairment of breast-feeding functions. The patient is further informed of the possible medical complications, and is shown surgical photographic records of the average outcomes of breast-reduction surgery. The surgeon answers the patient&#x27;s questions to assist in establishing realistic expectations (self-image) about the breast-reduction outcome possible with a lipectomy procedure; and that, should lipectomy not satisfactorily reduce the breast volume, a secondary, surgical breast-reduction procedure can be performed later.

The measures of the bust: a liposuction mammoplasty procedure does not feature a surgical-incision plan delineated upon the patient&#x27;s breasts, chest, and torso, but the measures of the bust are established in order to determine the required degree(s) of correction; thus, with the patient sitting erect, for each breast, the surgeon records the jugular-notch-to-nipple distances, the nipple-to-inframammary-fold distances, and any asymmetries. Afterwards, the anaesthetized patient is laid supine upon the operating table, arms laterally extended (abducted), in order to fully expose the breasts.

Anaesthestic preparation: to limit bleeding during the liposuction, the proper degree of vasoconstriction of the breast&#x27;s circulatory system is established with an anaesthetic solution (lidocaine + epinephrine in saline solution) that is infiltrated to the deep and the superficial plains of each breast. Using a blunt-tip, multi-perforation cannula, the anaesthetic infiltration begins at the deep plane of the breast, and continues as the cannula is withdrawn towards the superficial plane of the breast. The entire area of the breast is infiltrated with the anaesthetic solution until the tissues become tumescent (firm). Moreover, as required by the patient&#x27;s physique, an intravenous (IV) pressure bag can be applied to hasten the infiltration; after the anaesthetic has numbed the breast, the plastic surgeon begins the lipectomy breast-reduction.

====Operative technique====
The surgeon effects a stab incision just above the lateral aspect of the inframammary fold (IMF), piercing the skin 2-cm above the inframammary fold, in the midline. The pre-tunnelling is performed with the blunt-tip, multi-perforation cannula used to infiltrate the anaesthetic solution to the breast tissues. A blunt-tip, 4-mm cannula, connected either to a medical-grade vacuum pump or to a syringe, is used to aspirate the adipose fat. The cannula is maneuvered laterally (in fanning movements), beginning in the deep plane of the breast and concluding in the superficial plane of the breast; the adipose fat sucked from the breast is a yellow, fatty, bloodless fluid; the liposuction concludes upon drawing the required volume of fat, or when the fat becomes bloody.

After the liposuction, the superficial layer of adipose fat is undermined with a blunt-tip, 3-mm cannula (which is not connected to a vacuum pump). The breast ptosis is corrected by stimulating the controlled retraction of the incision scar, by undermining the superficial fat of the medial and the lateral upper areas of the breast; the maneuver tightens (retracts) the skin envelope of the breast. Procedurally, the liposuction-only breast reduction procedure concludes with the application of an elastic, foam-tape dressing that molds the reduced breast into its new shape, and lifts it higher upon the chest.

Technical note: for the reduction of very enlarged breasts, the plastic surgeon makes a supplementary incision just above the medial aspect of the inframammary fold. Procedurally, the placement of this incision later allows converting the lipectomy breast-reduction procedure into an inferior-pedicle breast reduction surgery, if liposuction proved inadequate to satisfactorily reducing the volume of the very enlarged breasts.

====Post-operative matters====

====Convalescence====
The patient is discharged from hospital either the same day or the day after the breast reduction operation. Because the liposuction-only procedure featured only a few, small, surgical incisions, the patient quickly recovers their health, usually resuming daily life activities at 14 to 28 days post-operative – when the breast-molding dressings are changed; the patient also resumes their personal hygiene regimen, to include washing under a water shower. In the initial convalescence period, the surgical-incision wounds are inspected at 1-week post-operative, during which time the patient has continuously worn a strapless brassière to contain and immobilize the corrected breasts; afterwards, the patient continuously wears a strapped brassière for 30 days after the breast-reduction operation.

====Complications====
Early complications include infection and hematoma (blood outside the vascular system); late complications include an unsatisfactory breast-volume reduction that might require either surgical or liposuction revision. As with other liposuction procedures, the final result of a liposuction-only breast reduction becomes evident at 6-months post-operative; although the edema usually subsides at 2–3 weeks post-operative. To date, no incidence of tissue necrosis has been reported; likewise, there have been few reports of lessened nipple sensation. Generally, the long-term rate of patient-satisfaction is high, provided that the indications for the liposuction-only technique are abided with proper patient selection.

<text>Barry Island () is a district, peninsula and seaside resort, forming part of the town of Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales. It is named after the 6th century Saint Baruc. Barry&#x27;s stretch of coast, on the Bristol Channel, has the world&#x27;s second highest tidal range of , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, Atlantic Canada.

The peninsula was an island until the 1880s when it was linked to the mainland as the town of Barry expanded. This was partly due to the opening of Barry Docks by the Barry Railway Company. Established by David Davies, the docks now link up the gap which used to isolate Barry Island.

Although Barry Island used to be home to a Butlins Holiday Camp, it is now known more for its beach and Barry Island Pleasure Park. It was used as a setting of the BBC TV shows &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; and &quot;Being Human&quot;.

== History ==

=== Prehistoric origins ===
The area around Barry Island shows extensive evidence of human occupation. Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age microlith flint tools have been found at Friars Point on Barry Island and near Wenvoe, and Neolithic or New Stone Age polished stone axe-heads were discovered in St. Andrews Major. As the area was heavily wooded and movement would have been restricted, it is likely that people also came to what was to become Wales by boat, apparently from the Iberian Peninsula. They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land.

These neolithic colonists, who integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changed from being hunter-gatherers to settled farmers. They built the long barrows at St Lythans and Tinkinswood, which date to around 6,000 BP, only and to the north of Barry Island, respectively.

In common with the people living all over Great Britain, over the following centuries the local population assimilated immigrants and exchanged ideas of the Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Together with much of South Wales, Barry Island was settled by a Celtic British tribe called the Silures. There have been five Bronze Age burial mounds, or cairns, recorded on Friars Point.

=== Roman and medieval eras ===
Although the Roman occupation saw significant Romano-British settlements at both Barry and Llandough, there is little physical evidence of Roman activity on Barry Island itself. However, the island would flourish as a religious community, following the end of Roman rule.

In the Post-Roman era, the Glamorgan coast became an important centre of early Celtic Christianity. Indeed, the Book of Llandaff defined the ancient diocese of Llandaff as stretching &quot;as far as the island Terthi&quot; (with &quot;Terthi&quot; being an earlier name for Barry island).

The island is said to have got its current name in the 6th century when Cattwg Ddoeth (Saint Cadoc, an important tutor of many Welsh saints including Illtud) spent seven years living as a hermit on the nearby Ynys Echni (Flat Holm). Upon arrival at Ynys Echni, it was discovered that one of Cattwg&#x27;s disciples had not brought all the texts that Cattwg required for his stay. Cattwg requested that this disciple travel back to the mainland to fetch them. The disciple, Barrwg drowned on this return journey, and was buried on the island that would become known as &quot;Ynys y Barri&quot;.

The Vikings launched raids in the area and Barry Island was known to be a raider base in 1087.

===Gerallt Gymro===
The Norman/Welsh chronicler Father Gerallt Gymro (c.1146 – c.1223) described the origin of his family name in his &quot;The Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales&quot; (also known as &quot;The Journey through Wales&quot;). Gerallt Gymro, also known in , and &quot;Gerald of Wales&quot;, wrote &quot;Not far from Caerdyf (sic) is a small island situated near the shore of the Severn, called Barri, from St. Baroc, who formerly lived there, and whose remains are deposited in a chapel overgrown with ivy, having been transferred to a coffin. From hence a noble family, of the maritime parts of South Wales, who owned this island and the adjoining estates, received the name of de Barri.&quot; Going on to describe the island&#x27;s well, he wrote: &quot;It is remarkable that, in a rock near the entrance of the island, there is a small cavity, to which, if the ear is applied, a noise is heard like that of smiths at work, the blowing of bellows, strokes of hammers, grinding of tools, and roaring of furnaces ; and it might easily be imagined that such noises, which are continued at the ebb and flow of the tides, were occasioned by the influx of the sea under the cavities of the rocks.

Local legend explains the phenomenon as the ghost of a local hero they call Benedict y Diffoddwr or in English &#x27;Benedict the Fighter&#x27;. It is said that when his ship, the &quot;Tam Lyn&quot;, was overrun by pirating Spaniards he almost single-handedly fought and killed the entire body of pirates even after they had slaughtered his entire crew. He then managed to sail his ship back to port on his own where he was heralded as a hero. They say after many other voyages during which it is rumoured, he fought off many other pirates (source unverifiable), he eventually died when he was caught in a great storm on the coast, during which his ship was irreparably damaged and sank to the bottom of the ocean.

The locals who believe the legend of Benedict claim that their defender still lingers in the rocky areas on the South coast, protecting the inhabitants from foreign invaders. &quot; 
The 1908 Everyman edition contains a brief description of Barry Island by the Benedictine monk Hugh Paulinus de Cressy (c.1605–1674): &quot;Barri Island is situated on the coast of Glamorganshire; and, according to Cressy, took its name from St. Baruc, the hermit, who resided, and was buried there. The Barrys in Ireland, as well as the family of Giraldus, who were lords of it, are said to have derived their names from this island. John Leland, in speaking of this island, says, &#x27;The passage into Barrey isle at ful se is a flite shot over, as much as the Tamise is above the bridge. At low water, there is a broken causey to go over, or els over the shalow streamelet of Barrey-brook on the sands. The isle is about a mile in cumpace, and hath very good corne, grasse, and sum wood; the ferme of it worth aio a yere. There ys no dwelling in the isle, but there is in the middle of it a fair little chapel of St Barrok, where much pilgrimage was usid.&#x27;&quot; Ernest Rhys, the Editor, adds in 1908: &quot;The &#x27;fair little chapel&#x27; has disappeared, and &#x27;Barry Island&#x27; is now, since the construction of the great dock, connected with the mainland, it is covered with houses, and its estimated capital value is now £250,000.&quot;

=== Modern times ===

Until 1896, when a rail link with the mainland via a 250-yard long causeway was completed, the only access to Barry Island had been either on foot across the sand and mud at low tide, or when the tide was in, by ferry from the shore at the Old Harbour. Barry Island railway station is the terminus of Network Rail&#x27;s Barry Branch and connects with the main line and various Valley lines at Cardiff, about north, north-east of Barry. Further tourist attractions were developed on the island, and by 1934 the number of visitors to the fairground during the August Bank Holiday week was over 400,000.

The ashes of Fred West, British serial killer, were scattered on Barry Island after his body had been cremated on 29 March 1995. 
British champion rollerblader and Barry native Rich Taylor died after a skating accident in a Barry street on 2 August 2004.

On 25 July 2008, Radio 1 featured Barry Island in one of their summer events, broadcasting a special edition of The Scott Mills Show live from the island as part of the show&#x27;s regular &quot;Barryoke&quot; theme, with songs such as &quot;Smooth Barry&quot;, a twist on the song &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; by Michael Jackson with a tour of Barry Island.

In 2012 the Wales Coast Path opened, containing a minor detour in which the path loops around Barry Island before continuing on westwards towards Llantwit Major.

==Governance==
Barry Island is part of the Baruc electoral ward, which includes Cold Knap and the southwestern part of Barry. It elects councillors to the Vale of Glamorgan Council and Barry Town Council.

== Holiday camp ==

Butlins Barry Island was a holiday camp that opened 1966 and closed in 1996, by which time it had been known as The Barry Island Resort for about nine years.

== On film ==

The holiday camp was used to film scenes in the &quot;Shangri-La&quot; holiday camp in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot;. The island was also a location for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the 2005 series episodes &quot;The Empty Child&quot; and &quot;The Doctor Dances&quot;, standing in for a bomb site in 1941 London and the 2014 series episode &quot;Flatline&quot;.

The 1987 horror film &quot;Bloody New Year&quot; filmed its fun fair scenes in the area.

The BBC television series &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; is partly set and filmed on Barry Island, this includes Marco&#x27;s Café, which is where the character Stacey works.
The Island also served as the setting for &quot;Pleasure Park&quot; on ITV Wales as part of the &quot;It&#x27;s My Shout&quot; short film series. Part of the Island including the Pleasure Park was used in the serial &quot;The Mad Woman in the Attic&quot;, part of the third series of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;.

The third, fourth and fifth series of the BBC supernatural drama &quot;Being Human&quot; were set and filmed in Barry (the series being originally set in Bristol until the central characters had to relocate after the second series), and were aired in early 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively.

The film &quot;Submarine&quot; was partly filmed in Barry.

&quot;Warship Class&quot; from the 2008 debut album by Silvery is set in Woodham Brothers scrapyard and mentions Barry Island.

Filming for the BBC television comedy Gavin and Stacey: The Finale began in Barry Island in summer 2024. The episode was aired on Christmas Day 2024.

<text>Burry Port () is a port town and community in Carmarthenshire, Wales, on the Loughor estuary (Moryd Llwchwr), to the west of Llanelli and south-east of Kidwelly. Its population was recorded at 5,680 in the 2001 census and 6,156 in the 2011 census, and estimated at 5,998 in 2019. The town has a harbour. It is also where Amelia Earhart landed as the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. Nearby are the Pembrey Burrows sand dune and wetland system, forming a country park, and the Cefn Sidan sands. Its musical heritage includes Burry Port Opera, Male Choir and Burry Port Town Band.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the River Burry, from which Burry Port takes its English name, is uncertain. It may derive from Old English &#x27; &quot;fort&quot; (cf. the ending &#x27; found in many English place names), referring to the small fort at North Hill Tor, or as it does elsewhere on the south Wales coast, to sand dunes, especially those associated with rabbit warrens (cf. the English word &#x27;). The Welsh name for the town, &#x27;, means &quot;port/bay of the sand dune&quot;.

==Geography==
Burry Port lies 5 miles west of the town of Llanelli. It sits at the mouth of the Loughor estuary, looking south towards the picturesque Gower peninsula. West of the town&#x27;s shoreline is Pembrey Burrows, a large area of burrow and marshland which historically occupied many square miles of land, much of which has later been reclaimed. To the north of the town is the hill Mynydd Donny, or Pembrey Mountain. Further north lie the Gwendraeth Valleys. The Gwendraeth Fawr runs north easterly from Kidwelly for about twelve miles (19 km). The land around the valley itself contains large amounts of coal as well as limestone. The Gwendraeth Fawr flows the length of the valley, and joins its sister river the Gwendraeth Fach west of Kidwelly before flowing into Carmarthen Bay. 
===Climate===
==Early history==
Burry Port is a modern settlement, but the nearby village of Pembrey dates from the Middle Ages, as shown by the medieval tower of the Church of St Illtud. People made a living in Burry Port from farming and fishing before the Industrial Revolution brought the railways and collieries to the area. As Pembrey Burrows was a hazard to shipping, local people would also salvage what they could from boats wrecked in storms while navigating the Bristol Channel.

Pembrey sands have proved the final resting place of many ships, some by mishap, others it is said lured to their doom deliberately to provide plunder for the wreckers known as &quot;Gwyr-y-Bwelli Bach&quot; or &quot;The Men of Little Hatchets&quot;. They were named after the locally made tool, a hatchet incorporating a claw for ripping open cargo and equally useful for dispatching unwanted witnesses to the wreckers&#x27; activities.

From the late 18th century a network of canals and then tramways grew up to carry coal from inland mines to the sea. Pembrey Harbour dates from 1819, but it proved too small and was followed by Pembrey New Harbour in 1836. This became known as Burry Port Harbour before it was completed.

==Industrial history==
===Coal mining and the Burry Port Harbour===
Records indicate that coalmining was established in the valley as early as 1540, although there was little effective transport. The Gwendraeth Fawr at the time was navigable but treacherous.

Growing interest in coal, limestone and iron ore drove the growth of the coal trade. Thomas Kymer, owner of many mining and other operations in the area established several loading places and primitive trackways to load barges on the Gwendraeth Fawr. Cargo was carried down the Gwendraeth river and then up the Towy to Carmarthen. In 1768 Kymer opened a canal and quay, part of which is today restored and preserved. The canal cut through the marshes allowing boats to travel upstream far enough to reach solid ground where quays could be built. This allowed barges to operate at all times and without having to wait for tides to get inland. A canal alone was not sufficient to solve the transport problems and wagonways were built to carry traffic from the mines to the canal itself. Several of these wagonways became plateways and then railways as technology improved.

A second canal was cut by the Earl of Ashburnham in 1798 to serve his mines nearby and this also was fed by wagonways. The canals continued to expand and wharves and dock facilities were built. More mines continued to open further up the valley sending their coal down through the canals to the sea. The trade in coal was hindered heavily however as the shifting sands made the river treacherous and the safe paths changed year by year.

In 1832, a harbour was built at Burry Port, a few years after the nearby harbour at Pembrey opened. Fed by a series of chaotic canals and wagonways it finally offered a way to ship Gwendraeth coal out by sea. Supporters of the harbour believed that its location offered considerable potential for expansion, especially as it had the advantage over neighbouring Llanelli Harbour that ships did not need to navigate the narrow channel along the Loughor estuary. In June 1838, John H. Browne, clerk to the Burry Port Harbour Company, wrote to the Cambrian newspaper drawing attention to these advantages after an article on port facilities in the South Wales Colafield failed to refer to Burry Port. In 1841, an account of the potential development of the anthracite coalfield highlighted the potential of Burry Port Harbour to accommodate larger ships than could progress through the narrow channel to the larger port at Llanelli.

No village or town of Burry Port yet existed. By 1840, the canals feeding Burry Port and their tramways fed coal from the entire Gwendraeth valley down to the sea. Early records of Burry Port as a town appear around 1850, springing up around the new docks adjacent to Pembrey. The importance of the newly emerging town was plain when the railways reached Burry Port, and the station serving both Pembrey and the new town of Burry Port was built a few hundred yards down from Pembrey at Burry Port.

The canal network was now unable to handle the loads from the Gwendraeth valley mines and part of the canal network was converted into the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway by the late 1860s with the port continuing to grow in importance and shipping volumes. It did not, however, achieve the levels of trade that many had anticipated and went into gradual decline in the 20th century.

===Copper works===
In 1848 a copper works was opened on a site adjacent to the harbour, and became a major employer and a key feature in the growth of the town. The main activity centred around a smelting furnace where copper ore was roasted and melted, and having removed the impurities, the refined copper was made into ingots and sheets. The works were established by Messrs. Mason and Elkington of Birmingham and the principal chimney, at 250 feet, was described in 1853 as a principal landmark for miles around.

===Carmarthen Bay Power Station===
Carmarthen Bay Power Station was built on the north shore of the Burry Estuary, occupying some 220 acres. Work started on its construction in April 1947, and power was first generated on 28 June 1953. At this time the plant employed around 500 people and during its 31 years of operation the three stacks became a local landmark. The power station ceased generating in 1984, and was demolished in the early 1990s.

==Present day==
With the closure of all the mines at Cwm Mawr, the railways up the valley were lifted. The harbour is now a marina for small leisure craft. Pembrey and Burry Port railway station remains, with regular services east via Swansea and Cardiff to London and west into Pembrokeshire.

For shopping, the town is served by a small supermarket, specialist shops, several hairdressers, a beauty and skincare salon, and an array of pubs and fast food outlets.

The public services include a lending library and four schools. Glan-y-Mor Comprehensive School (Glan-y-Mor translates as &quot;Seashore&quot;) has about 600 pupils. There is also a Welsh primary school – Ysgol Parc y Tywyn – and English-medium infants and junior schools in the town. It is also home to a lifeboat station, situated in Burry Port Harbour.

Burry Port lies on the Millennium Coastal Path from Bynea near Llanelli to Pembrey Burrows.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Burry Port, at community (town) and county level: Pembrey and Burry Port Town Council and Carmarthenshire County Council. The town council is based at the Memorial Hall and Institute on Parc-Y-Minos Street, which had been built in 1934.

Burry Port lies in the Llanelli parliamentary constituency, which has been held by the Labour Party since 1922.

Burry Port is an electoral ward for elections to Carmarthenshire County Council.

===Administrative history===
The Burry Port area historically formed part of the parish of Pembrey in Carmarthenshire. When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894, Pembrey was given a parish council and included in the Llanelly Rural District. As a result of the rapid growth of the town, in 1903 Burry Port was made its own urban district and civil parish.

Burry Port Urban District existed from 1903 until 1974. It was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Burry Port was created instead. District-level functions passed to Llanelli Borough Council. Carmarthenshire County Council was abolished as part of the same reforms, with county-level functions passing to the new Dyfed County Council. The borough of Llanelli and county of Dyfed were both abolished in 1996 and their councils&#x27; functions passed to a re-established Carmarthenshire County Council. In 1986 the community of Burry Port was merged with most of the neighbouring community of Pembrey to become a community named Cefn Sidan after the beach which forms much of the area&#x27;s coast. In 1999 the Cefn Sidan community was renamed Pembrey and Burry Port.

==Religion==
St Mary&#x27;s represents the Anglican Church in Wales. Jerusalem (Congregationalist) Chapel is the survivor of several chapels built in the locality in the 19th century; the minister there for several years was the former Archdruid of Wales, Meirion Evans. At the evening service to mark Christmas 2022 in Jerusalem Chapel Emyr Phillips was recognised for his 50 years of service as a Deacon to the chapel by Christopher Owen, the chapel Minister. Not in the 200 plus year history of the chapel has a Deacon served for 50 years.

Other former nonconformist chapels that have closed in the 21st century include Tabernacle (Welsh Baptist), now a chapel of rest; Seion (Welsh Congregationalist); and Bethany (Calvinistic Methodist). A war memorial from Bethany was transferred to Bethel, Pembrey, when the chapel closed.

==Amelia Earhart landing==

On 17 June 1928, Amelia Earhart flew to Newfoundland as a passenger, with pilots Wilmer &quot;Bill&quot; Stultz and Louis &quot;Slim&quot; Gordon in a Fokker F.VIIa/3m named &quot;Friendship&quot;, a type of seaplane known as a floatplane. She then flew the aircraft, arriving safely after 20 hours 40 minutes in Burry Port, making her the first female pilot to fly across the Atlantic. An Amelia Earhart festival was held in June 2003 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the landing, and the event is commemorated by engraved flagstones and a plaque in the harbour.

==Transport==
*Burry Port is connected to Llanelli and Carmarthen by the A484 road.
*There are regular local buses running through Burry Port, linking it with Carmarthen, Llanelli and Swansea, with a main stop across the railway bridge from the Co-operative store. However, evening and Sunday services were withdrawn in July 2014.
*Pembrey &amp; Burry Port railway station is on the West Wales Line. Westbound services from Burry Port terminate at Carmarthen or Pembroke Dock, with less frequent direct services to Fishguard and Milford Haven. Eastbound services terminate at Swansea, or run through to Manchester via Cardiff with less frequent direct services to London Paddington. Train services operate seven days a week, including evenings. Between 1909 and 1953 Burry Port station served the town on the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway. Following the removal of GWR station staff in the 1950s a ticket agency was set up on the Up platform. This was for some 50 years known as Pembrey Travel. For some 22 years the Proprietor was Emyr Phillips, a life long rail enthusiast. Many of the popular railway destinations tickets were sold by way of Edmondson tickets. These were the original rectangular card tickets devised by Thomas Edmondson in Carlisle. With the introduction of the new computerised ticketing system the national demise of the Edmondson Tickets came about on 4 February 1990. The location for the last ever Edmondson Ticket to be sold in Britain was here at Pembrey Travel in Burry Port, while Emyr Phillips was still the Proprietor of Pembrey Travel.
*Burry Port is connected to the Millennium Coastal Park, which includes a 22-km pedestrian walkway and cycle-way along the south coast of Carmarthenshire, providing a link between Bynea, Llanelli and Pembrey Country Park. The cycle-way forms a section of both the Celtic Trail cycle route (part of NCR 47) and the National Cycle Network NCR 4.
*Pembrey Airport is a commercial airfield for private and charter flights, a few miles west of Burry Port. The nearest regional airport with domestic and scheduled flights is Cardiff Airport.

<doc id="634892" wikidata="Q3237850" url="?curid=634892" title="Freedom of speech in the United States">
<text>In the United States, freedom of speech and expression is strongly protected from government restrictions by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, many state constitutions, and state and federal laws. Freedom of speech, also called &quot;free speech&quot;, means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference and restraint by the government The term &quot;freedom of speech&quot; embedded in the First Amendment encompasses the decision what to say as well as what not to say. The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized several categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment and has recognized that governments may enact reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions on speech. The First Amendment&#x27;s constitutional right of free speech, which is applicable to state and local governments under the incorporation doctrine, prevents only government restrictions on speech, not restrictions imposed by private individuals or businesses unless they are acting on behalf of the government. The right of free speech can, however, be lawfully restricted by time, place and manner in limited circumstances. Some laws may restrict the ability of private businesses and individuals from restricting the speech of others, such as employment laws that restrict employers&#x27; ability to prevent employees from disclosing their salary to coworkers or attempting to organize a labor union.

The First Amendment&#x27;s freedom of speech right not only proscribes most government restrictions on the content of speech and ability to speak, but also protects the right to receive information, prohibits most government restrictions or burdens that discriminate between speakers, restricts the tort liability of individuals for certain speech, and prevents the government from requiring individuals and corporations to speak or finance certain types of speech with which they do not agree.

Categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment include obscenity (as determined by the Miller test), fraud, child pornography, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, and regulation of commercial speech such as advertising. Within these limited areas, other limitations on free speech balance rights to free speech and other rights, such as rights for authors over their works (copyright), protection from imminent or potential violence against particular persons, restrictions on the use of untruths to harm others (slander and libel), and communications while a person is in prison. When a speech restriction is challenged in court, it is presumed invalid and the government bears the burden of convincing the court that the restriction is constitutional.

==History==
===England===
During colonial times, English speech regulations were rather restrictive. The English criminal common law of seditious libel made criticizing the government a crime. Lord Chief Justice John Holt, writing in 1704–1705, explained the rationale for the prohibition: &quot;For it is very necessary for all governments that the people should have a good opinion of it.&quot; The objective truth of a statement in violation of the libel law was not a defense.

Until 1694 England had an elaborate system of licensing; no publication was allowed without the accompaniment of the government-granted license.

===Colonies===
The colonies originally had very different views on the protection of free speech. During English colonialism in America, there were fewer prosecutions for seditious libel than England, but other controls over dissident speech existed.

The most stringent controls on speech in the colonial period were controls that outlawed or otherwise censored speech that was considered blasphemous in a religious sense. A 1646 Massachusetts law, for example, punished persons who denied the immortality of the soul. In 1612, a Virginia governor declared the death penalty for a person that denied the Trinity under Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Laws Divine, Moral and Martial&quot;, which also outlawed blasphemy, speaking badly of ministers and royalty, and &quot;disgraceful words&quot;.

More recent scholarship, focusing on seditious speech in the 17th-century colonies (when there was no press), has shown that from 1607 to 1700 the colonists&#x27; freedom of speech expanded dramatically, laying a foundation for the political dissent that flowered among the Revolutionary generation.

The trial of John Peter Zenger in 1735 was a seditious libel prosecution for Zenger&#x27;s publication of criticisms of the Governor of New York, William Cosby. Andrew Hamilton represented Zenger and argued that truth should be a defense to the crime of seditious libel, but the court rejected this argument. Hamilton persuaded the jury, however, to disregard the law and to acquit Zenger. The case is considered a victory for freedom of speech as well as a prime example of jury nullification. The case marked the beginning of a trend of greater acceptance and tolerance of free speech.

===First Amendment ratification===
In the 1780s after the American Revolutionary War, debate over the adoption of a new Constitution resulted in a division between Federalists, such as Alexander Hamilton who favored a strong federal government, and Anti-Federalists, such as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry who favored a weaker federal government.

During and after the Constitution ratification process, Anti-Federalists and state legislatures expressed concern that the new Constitution placed too much emphasis on the power of the federal government. The drafting and eventual adoption of the Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment, was, in large part, a result of these concerns, as the Bill of Rights limited the power of the federal government.

===Alien and Sedition Acts===

In 1798, Congress, which contained several of the ratifiers of the First Amendment at the time, adopted the Alien and Sedition Acts. The laws prohibited the publication of &quot;false, scandalous, and malicious writings against the government of the United States, or either house of the Congress of the United States, or the President of the United States, with intent to defame ... or to bring them ... into contempt or disrepute; or to excite against them ... hatred of the good people of the United States, or to stir up sedition within the United States, or to excite any unlawful combinations therein, for opposing or resisting any law of the United States, or any act of the President of the United States&quot;.

The law did allow truth as a defense and required proof of malicious intent. The 1798 Act nevertheless made ascertainment of the intent of the framers regarding the First Amendment somewhat difficult, as some of the members of Congress that supported the adoption of the First Amendment also voted to adopt the 1798 Act. The Federalists under President John Adams aggressively used the law against their rivals, the Democratic-Republicans. The Alien and Sedition Acts were a major political issue in the 1800 election, and after he was elected President, Thomas Jefferson pardoned those who had been convicted under the Act. The Act expired and the Supreme Court never ruled on its constitutionality.

In &quot;New York Times v. Sullivan&quot;, the Court declared &quot;Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history.&quot; 376 U.S. 254, 276 (1964).

===Censorship era===
From the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, various laws restricted speech in ways that are today not allowed, mainly due to societal norms. Possibly inspired by foul language and the widely available pornography he encountered during the American Civil War, Anthony Comstock advocated for government suppression of speech that offended Victorian morality. He convinced the government of New York State to create the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, in 1873, and inspired the creation of the Watch and Ward Society in Boston in 1878. City and state governments monitored newspapers, books, theater, comedy acts, and films for offensive content, and enforced laws with arrests, impoundment of materials, and fines. The Comstock laws passed by Congress (and related state laws) prohibited sending materials through the U.S. mail that included pornography; information about contraception, abortion, and sex toys; and personal letters mentioning sexual activities. Regulation of American film by state and local governments was supplemented by the Motion Picture Production Code from to 1930 to 1968, in an industry effort to preempt federal regulation. The similar industry-backed Comics Code Authority lasted from 1954 to 2011.

Some laws were motivated not by morality, but concerns over national security. The Office of Censorship suppressed communication of information of military importance during World War II, including by journalists and all correspondence going into or out of the United States. McCarthyism from the 1940s to the 1950s resulted in the suppression of advocacy of Communism, and the Hollywood blacklist. This included some prosecutions under the Smith Act of 1940.

===Modern view===
As a result of the jurisprudence of the Warren Court in the mid-to-late 20th century, the Court has moved towards a baseline default rule under which freedom of speech is generally presumed to be protected, unless a specific exception applies. Therefore, apart from certain narrow exceptions, the government normally cannot regulate the &quot;content&quot; of speech. In 1971, in &quot;Cohen v. California&quot;, Justice John Marshall Harlan II, citing &quot;Whitney v. California&quot;, emphasized that the First Amendment operates to protect the inviolability of &quot;a marketplace of ideas&quot;, while Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall cogently explained in 1972 that:

==Types of speech==

===Core political speech===
Core political speech is the discussion of political matters, including commentary on governmental laws and policies, discussion of public issues which may be subject to governmental action, commentary on political parties, individual politicians, political candidates and so on. This includes the right to publicly criticize the government and its leaders, potentially in very harsh or offensive terms. Core political speech is the most highly guarded form of speech because of its importance to a functional republic. In Buckley v. Valeo, for instance, the Supreme Court wrote:

Restrictions placed upon core political speech must weather strict scrutiny analysis or they will be struck down. The Supreme Court has ruled that suffrage itself is not political &quot;speech&quot; and thus can be subjected to significant regulations, and the right to run for office may likewise be restricted. Calling for such restrictions to be altered or abolished, however, is protected under the First Amendment, and certain kinds of suffrage restrictions are already prohibited by other parts of the constitution.

===Commercial speech===

Not wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment is commercial speech, which is speech that &quot;propose[s] a commercial transaction&quot;, as defined by &quot;Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.&quot; in 1978. Such speech still has expressive value although it is being uttered in a marketplace ordinarily regulated by the state. In 1980, &quot;Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission&quot; held that restrictions of commercial speech are subject to a four-element intermediate scrutiny. &quot;Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.&quot; (2011) casts doubt upon whether commercial speech still exists as a distinct type of speech.

===Expressive conduct===
Expressive conduct, also called &quot;symbolic speech&quot; or &quot;speech acts,&quot; is nonverbal conduct that intends to communicate a message. Examples include creating or destroying an object when performed as a statement (such as flag burning in a political protest), silent marches and parades intended to convey a message, clothing bearing meaningful symbols (such as anti-war armbands), body language, messages written in code, ideas and structures embodied as computer code (&quot;software&quot;), mathematical and scientific formulae, and illocutionary acts that convey by implication an attitude, request, or opinion.

Expressive conduct is recognized by federal court decisions as being protected under the First Amendment as a form of speech, although this is not expressly written as such in the document.

For example, seen in light of the First Amendment, computer code is a &quot;way to speak&quot; about how a problem is solved, using the precise terms a computer might be given as directions, and flag burning is a &quot;way to speak&quot; or express forcefully of one&#x27;s views opposing the acts or political position of the relevant country. Significantly, the possibility exists for a single speech act to be protected or not &quot;depending upon context and intention&quot;. For example, there may be a First Amendment distinction between burning a flag in protest and the same act performed as mere wanton vandalism.

===Vague and meaningless speech===
Some expressions have an ambiguous, difficult to articulate, unintended, or indiscernible meaning. These include instrumental music, abstract art, and nonsense. These are generally included in protected &quot;speech&quot;, but some of the justifications for doing so do not apply. In the 1995 decision &quot;Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that the art of Jackson Pollock, the expressionist music of Arnold Schoenberg, and the semi-nonsense poem Jabberwocky are protected. This stands in contrast to, for example, Nazi Germany, which banned what it called &quot;degenerate art&quot; and &quot;degenerate music&quot;.

In the 2010 decision &quot;Kleinman v. City of San Marcos&quot;, the U.S. Fifth Circuit noted a number of cases where artistic expressive elements were mixed with non-speech elements (such as an artistically painted junked car or clothing decorated with graffiti art). In each case, the courts chose to apply full First Amendment protection, but used intermediate scrutiny and upheld the content-neutral government regulations at issue (e.g. no junked cars displayed on public roads, time and place restrictions on sidewalk vendors).

In the case &quot;Morse v. Frederick&quot;, the defendant claimed the slogan &quot;BONG HiTS 4 JESUS&quot; &quot;intended&quot; to provoke amusement or disgust but not advocate anything, but the Supreme Court ruled it could be punished under the school speech doctrine because a reasonable person could &quot;interpret&quot; it as advocating illegal drug use (which was against school policy).

==Types of speech restrictions==
The Supreme Court has recognized several different types of laws that restrict speech, and subjects each type of law to a different level of scrutiny.

=== Content-based restrictions ===
Content-based restrictions &quot;are presumptively unconstitutional regardless of the government&#x27;s benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of animus toward the ideas contained in the regulated speech.&quot; Restrictions that require examining the content of speech to be applied must pass strict scrutiny.

Content-based restrictions can either discriminate based on viewpoint or subject matter. An example of a law regulating the subject matter of speech would be a city ordinance that forbids all picketing in front of a school except for labor picketing. This law would amount to subject matter discrimination because it favors one subject over another in deciding who it will allow to speak. An example of a law that regulates a speaker&#x27;s viewpoint would be a policy of a government official who permitted opponents of abortion to speak on government property but banned proponents of legal abortion care because of their views would be engaged in &quot;viewpoint discrimination&quot;. Restrictions that apply to certain viewpoints but not others face the highest level of scrutiny, and are usually overturned, unless they fall into one of the court&#x27;s special exceptions. An example of this is found in the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez&quot; in 2001. In this case, the Court held that government subsidies cannot be used to discriminate against a specific instance of viewpoint advocacy.

The Court pointed out in &quot;Snyder v. Phelps&quot; (2011) that one way to ascertain whether a restriction is content-based versus content-neutral is to consider if the speaker had delivered a &quot;different&quot; message under exactly the same circumstances: &quot;A group of parishioners standing at the very spot where Westboro stood, holding signs that said &#x27;God Bless America&#x27; and &#x27;God Loves You,&#x27; would not have been subjected to liability. It was what Westboro said that exposed it to tort damages.&quot;

=== Time, place, and manner restrictions ===
&quot;Grayned v. City of Rockford&quot; (1972) summarized the time, place, manner concept: &quot;The crucial question is whether the manner of expression is basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time.&quot;
Time, place, and manner restrictions must withstand intermediate scrutiny. Note that any regulations that would force speakers to change how or what they say do not fall into this category (so the government cannot restrict one medium even if it leaves open another). &quot;Ward v. Rock Against Racism&quot; (1989) held that time, place, or manner restrictions must:
* Be content neutral
* Be narrowly tailored
* Serve a significant governmental interest
* Leave open ample alternative channels for communication

Freedom of speech is also sometimes limited to so-called free speech zones, which can take the form of a wire fence enclosure, barricades, or an alternative venue designed to segregate speakers according to the content of their message. There is much controversy surrounding the creation of these areas – the mere existence of such zones is offensive to some people, who maintain that the First Amendment makes the entire country an unrestricted free speech zone. Civil libertarians often claim that Free Speech Zones are used as a form of censorship and public relations management to conceal the existence of popular opposition from the mass public and elected officials.

==== Definition and early history ====
Time, place, and manner restrictions refer to a legal doctrine enforced under the United States Constitution and Supreme Court. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines time, place, and manner restrictions as &quot;[A] restriction on the time, place, or manner of expression that is justified when it is neutral as to content and serves a significant government interest and leaves open ample alternative channels of communication. The goal of time, place and manner restrictions is to regulate speech in a way that still protects freedom of speech.

While freedom of speech is considered by the United States to be a fundamental right, it is not absolute, and therefore subject to restrictions. Time, place, and manner restrictions are relatively self-explanatory. Time restrictions regulate when expression can take place; place restrictions regulate where expression can take place; and manner restrictions regulate how expression can take place. A restriction may occur if someone is protesting loudly in front of someone&#x27;s house in a neighborhood in the middle of the night, or if someone was sitting in the middle of a busy intersection during rush hour, for example. These actions would cause problems for other people, so restricting speech in terms of time, place, and manner addresses a legitimate societal concern. Restricting this speech would be constitutional because the restrictions are content neutral, meaning they would restrict anyone from saying anything in these situations, no matter what their message is; they are narrowly drawn, meaning the restriction was examined specifically for the case in question to determine how to serve the governmental interest at stake; the restrictions serve a significant governmental interest, meaning other fundamental rights are important to citizens, such as sleeping peacefully at night or people getting to work or home from work; and there are plenty of alternative methods of communicating their message, such as writing an editorial in the paper or moving to the sidewalk at a different time in the day.

One of the earliest mentions of the principle of time, place, and manner restrictions comes in the &quot;Cox v. Louisiana&quot; (1965) case. Justice Goldberg delivered the opinion and stated, &quot;From these decisions, certain clear principles emerge. The rights of free speech and assembly, while fundamental in our democratic society, still do not mean that everyone with opinions or beliefs to express may address a group at any public place and at any time.&quot; From this, the United States Supreme Court doctrine of time, place, and manner restrictions emerged.

==== Time, place, and manner restrictions and the First Amendment ====
The First Amendment of the United States Constitution declares that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot; It is easy to mistakenly interpret the First Amendment as granting people the right to say whatever they want, whenever, and wherever they want. However, the United States Supreme Court has interpreted that the First Amendment was never intended to provide such power, because it does not protect speech at all times and in all places. The Court has consistently ruled that the government has the power to impose limits on free speech in regard to its time, place, and manner of delivery. As noted in &quot;Clark&quot; v. &quot;Community for Creative Non-Violence&quot; (1984)&quot;,&quot; &quot;... [time, place, and manner] restrictions ... are valid provided that they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.&quot; These restrictions are proved constitutional time and time again, in many Supreme Court cases. It is important to understand the limits to the protection of freedom of speech by learning about time, place, and manner restrictions.

==== Public forum doctrine ====
Time, place, and manner restrictions are often linked with the public forum doctrine. The Supreme Court has established three types of forums: traditional public forums, designated forums, and nonpublic forums.

Traditional public forums include public areas, such as parks and sidewalks. These areas have the strongest protections under the First Amendment. Although, traditional public forums are still subject to traditional time, place, and manner restrictions, meaning restrictions must be content-neutral, serve a significant governmental interest, and allow for ample alternatives. As noted in &quot;United States Postal Service&quot; v. &quot;Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations&quot; (1981)&quot;,&quot; &quot;The First Amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.&quot; Justice Marshall in &quot;Grayned&quot; v. &quot;City of Rockford&quot; (1972), also noted something similar, saying &quot;The crucial question is whether the manner of expression is basically compatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time.&quot; The power of restriction has been seen in many cases, such as in &quot;The&quot; &quot;City of Chicago&quot; v. &quot;Alexander&quot; (2014) case when the Occupy movement was restricted because the park was closed and they were not allowed to protest there during that time. Nevertheless, speech cannot be discriminated against because of the views of the speaker, or the content of their speech. These are generally called View-Point and Content-Based Limitations. Some people argue that time, place, and manner restrictions are relied on too heavily by free speech doctrine, resulting in less free speech allowed in public forums. This view is highly contested. Other people, such as Justice Pierce, who delivered the opinion in &quot;The City of Chicago&quot; v. &quot;Alexander&quot; (2014)&quot;,&quot; argue restrictions are only meant to defer speech, in order to limit problems that are put on society.

A designated forum is usually public property the government opens for public expression, such as theatres and state schools. The difference between traditional public forums and designated public forums is in a designated public forum the government may limit access to the area to only certain groups, speakers, or subjects, so long as their rules are consistent. Designated public forums are subject to the same restrictions as traditional public forums, meaning the time, place, and manner restrictions must be content-neutral, serve a governmental interest, and allow ample alternatives. Restrictions in a designated forum can be seen in cases such as &quot;Widmar v. Vincent&quot; (1981) and &quot;City of Madison Joint School District v. Wisconsin PERC&quot; (1976)&quot;.&quot;

Nonpublic forums include airport terminals and internal mail systems. In these areas the government has significant control over the speech they allow in these forums because the government acts like a private owner here. This means the government may restrict any speech, as long as the restrictions are reasonable, and do not come in to play because a public official wants the speech restricted. Therefore, content may be restricted because of the subject or the speaker. However, the restrictions must align with the purpose of the area and be viewpoint neutral. This doctrine has been applied to cases such as &quot;Perry Education Association&quot; v. &quot;Perry Local Educators&#x27; Association&quot; (1983) and &quot;Hazelwood School District&quot; v. &quot;Kuhlmeier&quot; (1988).

==== Time, place, and manner restrictions in Supreme Court decisions ====
Time, place, and manner restrictions are intended to allow convenience and order to prevail. Some examples of time, place, and manner cases include: &quot;Grayned&quot; v. &quot;Rockford&quot; (1972), &quot;Heffron&quot; v. &quot;International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc.&quot; (1981), , and . Most time, place, and manner cases involve the government as one of the parties in the case.

Because time, place, and manner restrictions put value on convenience and order, there is certain behavior that is not permitted. For example, you cannot yell &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded place when there is no fire. This action would cause an uproar of chaos, and has the potential to cause immediate harm to others. For those reasons, this action would not qualify as a protected right under the First Amendment. As Justice Holmes put it in &quot;Schenck&quot; v. &quot;United States&quot; (1918)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Even the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing panic.&quot; While free speech is important in our society, there are other values in our society that are equally important, such as public order and public peace. The role of time, place, and manner restrictions are balanced with conflicting values in our society.

It is important to understand how judges and other governmental entities decide what speech to limit in regard to time, place, and manner. As previously stated, in order for the Supreme Court and other governmental entities to impose time, place, and manner restrictions, they must decide that the restrictions are content neutral, narrowly tailored, serve a significant governmental interest, and allow other alternative methods of communication. If the restrictions can pass these four requirements, they will align with the First Amendment restriction provisions. Of course, these restrictions will vary from case to case. Ideally, suppressing speech is considered wrong, but in some cases, it is necessary to restrict speech for the greater good of society. It must be decided that the speech is a nuisance in regard to its time, place, or manner of delivery, such as creating a clear and present danger. If there is a problem with the time, place, or manner of delivery of the speech, Congress has the right to limit such speech.

==== Recent time, place, and manner case: &quot;Chicago&quot; v&quot;. Alexander&quot; ====
As noted in &quot;The City of Chicago v. Alexander&quot; (2014)&quot;,&quot; &quot;The [F]irst [A]mendment does not guarantee the right to communicate one&#x27;s views at all times and places or in any manner that may be desired. A state may therefore impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place or manner of constitutionally protected speech occurring in a public forum.&quot; It is permitted to restrict speech in terms of time, place, and manner, so long as there are ample alternatives available. The ample alternative provision can cause confusion for those trying to understand time, place, and manner restrictions. What qualifies as an acceptable alternative? An alternative does not need to be the first choice of a way to communicate, nor does it need to be the same method of communication&quot;.&quot; That is, if the original method of communication was vocal, an acceptable alternative could be written. In fact, an ample alternative does not even have to reach the same audience as the original speech&quot;.&quot; In the case of &quot;The City of Chicago&quot; v. &quot;Alexander&quot; (2014)&quot;,&quot; an ample alternative to protesting in Grant Park after hours could have been to protest on the sidewalk across the street, or to protest in the morning in the park when it reopened. It is important to remember that time, place, and manner restrictions are not intended to restrict the content of what is being said, instead they restrict when, where, or how the message is being communicated.

As &quot;The City of Chicago&quot; v. &quot;Alexander&quot; (2014) case pointed out, in &quot;United States&quot; v. &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; (1968) the court created a test for the content neutral provision&quot;.&quot; The &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; (1968) court declared, &quot;... a government regulation is sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the Government; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is not greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.[33]&quot; Content neutrality is an essential provision to meet because if a law lacks content neutrality due to targeting a particular viewpoint or means of expression, it will often violate other constitutional principles, such as the equal protection clause.[34] Expressing content neutrality is essential in successfully limiting speech through time, place, and manner restrictions in a public forum.

===Incidental burdens on speech===
See &quot;United States v. O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

=== Prior restraint ===
If the government tries to restrain speech before it is spoken, as opposed to punishing it afterwards, it must be able to show that punishment after the fact is not a sufficient remedy, and show that allowing the speech would &quot;surely result in direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to our Nation and its people&quot; (&quot;New York Times Co. v. United States&quot;). U.S. courts have not permitted most prior restraints since the case of &quot;Near v. Minnesota&quot; in 1931. However, the 1988 case of &quot;Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier&quot; was argued to be a means of prior restraint due to a school principal eliminating content and topics from the school newspaper that was written by students at Hazelwood East High School in St. Louis, Missouri. The U.S. Supreme Court deemed the school was not in violation of students&#x27; first amendment rights because the paper was sponsored by the school that upheld rules and regulations about inappropriate articles.

== Exclusions ==
=== Falsehoods ===

Laws against commercial fraud, counterfeit currency, and perjury have been upheld within certain limits, but false statements of fact are generally protected. In &quot;United States v. Alvarez&quot;, the majority opinion stated &quot;[t]he Government has not demonstrated that false statements generally should constitute a new category of unprotected speech... Permitting the government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense, whether shouted from the rooftops or made in a barely audible whisper, would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable. That governmental power has no clear limiting principle.&quot;

===Inciting imminent lawless action===
Speech that incites imminent lawless action was originally banned under the weaker clear and present danger test established by &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;, but this test has since been overturned by the imminent lawless action test established in &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;.

=== Fighting words ===
Inflammatory words that are either injurious by themselves or might cause the hearer to immediately retaliate or breach the peace. Use of such words is not necessarily protected &quot;free speech&quot; under the First Amendment.

=== True threats ===

See &quot;Watts v. United States&quot;, &quot;Virginia v. Black&quot;.

=== Obscenity ===
Obscenity, defined by the Miller test by applying contemporary community standards, is a type of speech which is not legally protected. It is speech to which all the following apply: appeals to the prurient interest, depicts or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. (This is usually applied to more hard-core forms of pornography.)

The 1998 Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act in Alabama applies to sex toys. The similar 1973 Texas obscenity statute (updated in 2003) was declared unconstitutional in 2008.

====Child pornography====
See &quot;New York v. Ferber&quot;.

===Torts===

====Defamation====

Limits placed on libel and slander attach civil liability and have been upheld by the Supreme Court. The Court narrowed the definition of libel with the case of &quot;Hustler Magazine v. Falwell&quot; made famous in the movie &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;. &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; established the actual malice standard, a high bar for public figure plaintiffs. Making false statements in &quot;matters within the jurisdiction&quot; of the federal government is also a crime.

====Invasion of privacy====
See &quot;Time, Inc. v. Hill&quot;.

==== Intentional infliction of emotional distress ====
See &quot;Hustler Magazine v. Falwell&quot;, &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;.

===Political spending===

====Campaign contributions====
See &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot; and &quot;McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission&quot;.

====Independent political expenditures====
See &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;

===Government speech===
The government speech doctrine establishes that the government may censor speech when the speech is its own, leading to a number of contentious decisions on its breadth.

===Public employee speech===
Statements made by public employees pursuant to their official duties are not protected by the First Amendment from employer discipline as per the case of &quot;Garcetti v. Ceballos&quot;. This applies also to private contractors that have the government as a client. The First Amendment only protects employees from government employers when speaking publicly outside their official duties in the public interest &quot;Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist.&quot;, updated and clarified by &quot;Lane v. Franks&quot;. Speech is not protected from private sector disciplinary action.

A number of cases consider speech related to or required by an employer, or speech retaliated against by a third party such as an employer. The case &quot;Lane vs. Burrows&quot; (previously Lane vs. Franks) considers a number of these matters and summarizes the outcome. A person who testifies in a court, and where that testimony is not part of their employment duties, testifies as a citizen and has First Amendment protection, whereas a person whose speech is an actual part of their duties and is not merely &quot;related&quot; to their duties may have no such protection.

The issues raised in such cases include the overriding need for persons in court to feel safe to speak the truth, and to in fact speak the truth; the requirement of employers to be able to act if an employee speaks in a manner damaging to the employer; the rights of whistleblowers; the benefit to society if people who know the reality of a matter and are well informed of it, are able to speak of it.

=== Student speech ===

In &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot; (1969), the Supreme Court extended broad First Amendment protection to children attending public schools, prohibiting censorship unless there is &quot;substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others&quot;. Several subsequent rulings have affirmed or narrowed this protection. &quot;Bethel School District v. Fraser&quot; (1986) supported disciplinary action against a student whose campaign speech was filled with sexual innuendo, and determined to be &quot;indecent&quot; but not &quot;obscene&quot;. &quot;Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier&quot; (1988) allowed censorship in school newspapers which had not been established as forums for free student expression. &quot;Guiles v. Marineau&quot; (2006) affirmed the right of a student to wear a T-shirt mocking President George W. Bush, including allegations of alcohol and drug use. &quot;Morse v. Frederick&quot; (2007) supported the suspension of a student holding a banner reading &quot;BONG HiTS 4 JESUS&quot; at a school-supervised event which was not on school grounds. In &quot;Lowry v. Watson Chapel School District&quot;, an appeals court struck down a school dress code and literature distribution policy for being vague and unnecessarily prohibitive of criticism against the school district.

Such protections also apply to public colleges and universities; for example, student newspapers which have been established as forums for free expression have been granted broad protection by appeals courts.

===National security===

====Military secrets====
Publishing, gathering, or collecting national security information is not protected speech in the United States. Information related to &quot;the national defense&quot; is protected even though no harm to the national security is intended or is likely to be caused through its disclosure. Non-military information with the potential to cause serious damage to the national security is only protected from willful disclosure with the requisite intent or knowledge regarding the potential harm. The unauthorized creation, publication, sale, or transfer of photographs or sketches of vital defense installations or equipment as designated by the President is prohibited. The knowing and willful disclosure of certain classified information is prohibited. The unauthorized communication by anyone of &quot;Restricted Data&quot;, or an attempt or conspiracy to communicate such data, is prohibited. It is prohibited for a person who learns of the identity of a covert agent through a &quot;pattern of activities intended to identify and expose covert agents&quot; to disclose the identity to any individual not authorized access to classified information, with reason to believe that such activities would impair U.S. foreign intelligence efforts.

In addition to the criminal penalties, the use of employment contracts, loss of government employment, monetary penalties, non-disclosure agreements, forfeiture of property, injunctions, revocation of passports, and prior restraint are used to deter such speech.

====Inventions====
The Voluntary Tender Act of 1917 gave the Commissioner of Patents the authority to withhold certification from inventions that might harm U.S. national security, and to turn the invention over to the United States government for its own use. It was replaced in 1951 with the Invention Secrecy Act which prevented inventors from publishing inventions or sharing the information. Both attached criminal penalties to subjected inventors. The United States was under a declared state of emergency from 1950–1974, after which peacetime secrecy orders were available.

The government issued between approximately 4,100 to 5,000 orders per year from 1959 to 1974, a peak of 6,193 orders in 1991, and approximately 5,200 per year between from 1991 to 2003. Certain areas of research such as atomic energy and cryptography consistently fall within their gamut. The government has placed secrecy orders on cold fusion, space technology, radar missile systems, and Citizens Band radio voice scramblers, and attempts have been made to extend them to optical-engineering research and vacuum technology.

====Nuclear information====
The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 automatically classifies &quot;all data concerning (1) design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; (2) the production of special nuclear material; or (3) the use of special nuclear material in the production of energy&quot;. The government has attempted and failed to prohibit publication of nuclear information, including bomb design, in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1950 and &quot;The Progressive&quot; in 1979.

====Weapons====
 of 1999, a bill focused on phosphate prospecting and compensation owed to the Menominee tribe, added making it an offence &quot;to or the making or use of an explosive, a destructive device, or a weapon of mass destruction, or to distribute by any means information pertaining to, in whole or in part, the manufacture or use of an explosive, destructive device, or weapon of mass destruction&quot; either intending or knowing &quot;that the teaching, demonstration, or information be used for, or in furtherance of, an activity that constitutes a Federal crime of violence&quot;. This is in addition to other federal laws preventing the use and dissemination of bombmaking information for criminal purposes. The law was first successfully used against 18-year-old Sherman Martin Austin in 2003, for distribution of information which has since been republished freely. Austin plead guilty to the offense and his conviction was not appealed, so the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 842(p) is still uncertain.

== Censorship ==
While personal freedom of speech is usually respected, freedom of press, and mass publishing meet with some restrictions. Some of the recent issues include:
* United States military censoring blogs written by military personnel
* The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) censoring television and radio, citing obscenity, e.g., Howard Stern and Opie and Anthony (though the FCC only has the power to regulate over the air broadcasts and not cable or satellite television or satellite radio) See also &quot;Roth v. United States&quot;
* Scientology suppressing criticism, citing freedom of religion, e.g., Keith Henson

Opponents of anti-BDS laws claim that Israel and its supporters are engaging in lawfare by lobbying for anti-BDS laws that infringe upon the right to free speech.

In 2002, the United States was ranked 17th of 167 countries in the annual worldwide Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders. &quot;The poor ranking of the United States (17th) is mainly because of the number of journalists arrested or imprisoned there. Arrests are often because they refuse to reveal their sources in court. Also, since the September 11 attacks, several journalists have been arrested for crossing security lines at some official buildings.&quot; In the 2006 index the United States fell further to 53rd of 168 countries; indeed, &quot;relations between the media and the Bush administration sharply deteriorated&quot; as it became suspicious of journalists who questioned the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;. The zeal of federal courts which, unlike those in 33 U.S. states, refuse to recognize the media&#x27;s right not to reveal its sources, even threatened journalists whose investigations did not pertain to terrorism. The United States improved, moving up to 48th place in 2007, however, and to 20th in 2010. In the following years, the rank again declined, placing the United States 45th in 2020.

== Internet speech, online forums ==
In a 9–0 decision, the Supreme Court extended the full protection of the First Amendment to the Internet in &quot;Reno v. ACLU&quot;, a decision that struck down portions of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, a law that prohibited &quot;indecent&quot; online communication. The court&#x27;s decision extended the constitutional protections given to books, magazines, films, and spoken expression to materials published on the Internet. Congress tried a second time to regulate the content of the Internet with the Child Online Protection Act (COPA). In 2002, the Supreme Court again ruled in &quot;American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft&quot; that any limitations on the Internet are unconstitutional.

In &quot;United States v. American Library Association&quot; (2003), the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the authority to require public schools and libraries receiving e-rate discounts to install content-control software as a condition of receiving federal funding. The justices said that any First Amendment concerns were addressed by the provisions in the Children&#x27;s Internet Protection Act that permit adults to ask librarians to disable the filters or unblock individual sites.

==Private actors, private property, firing employees of private employers==
Despite the common misconception that the First Amendment prohibits anyone from limiting free speech, the text of the amendment only prohibits the US Congress (and, by extension, those that derive their powers from Congress) from doing so. Starting with the 1925 U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Gitlow v. New York&quot;, this prohibition has been incorporated to apply to state and local governments as well, based on the text of the Fourteenth Amendment.

A major issue in freedom of speech jurisprudence has been whether the First Amendment should be interpreted to merely run against these state actors, or whether it can run against private actors as well. Specifically, the issue is whether private landowners should be permitted to use the machinery of government to exclude others from engaging in free speech on their property (which means balancing the speakers&#x27; First Amendment rights against the Takings Clause). The right of freedom of speech within private shopping centers owned by others has been vigorously litigated under both the federal and state Constitutions, most notably in the cases &quot;Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner&quot; (1972) and &quot;Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins&quot; (1980).

=== Social media platforms ===

Given the dispute between the Fifth and Eleventh circuits, it is likely that the Supreme Court will determine the proper First Amendment classification for social media. Privately owned social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are not bound by the First Amendment. Nevertheless, social media platforms have banned or censored users at the request of government staff and elected officials. Platforms have developed regulations and procedures of their own, attempting to balance free expression by their users against the moderation or removal of objectionable or harmful speech. In the course of developing private policies and procedures, they have in several cases employed concepts or standards developed by U.S. courts in free speech cases, such as the public figure doctrine developed since &quot;New York Times v. Sullivan&quot;.

Some observers have decried an erosion of free speech due to widespread use of the Internet and social media, which has allowed large groups of people who disapprove of particular speech have been able to swarm upon certain speakers and harass them with death and rape threats, send SWAT teams by making false reports to police, trigger boycotts of businesses, and in at least one case motivate a shooting. Targets have included a Massachusetts businessman who was seen in a photo apparently supporting Donald Trump, female video game designers and commentators, a diner where an anti-Trump employee made a negative comment to a pro-Trump customer, a public relations executive who tweeted an offensive joke before boarding a plane, and even victims of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting accused by anti-gun-control activists of faking the event.

=== College campuses ===
First Amendment protections apply to public colleges and universities in the United States, significantly limiting the ability of school administrations or government bodies to impose restrictive speech codes at public institutions of higher education. However, much of the controversy over free expression in American colleges and universities has dealt with other questions of institutional policies, questions of academic freedom, and the climate of opinion on campus at both public and private institutions.

In July 2014, the University of Chicago released the &quot;Chicago Statement,&quot; a free speech policy statement designed to combat censorship on campus. This statement was later adopted by a number of top-ranked universities including Princeton University, Washington University in St. Louis, Johns Hopkins University, and Columbia University. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a nonprofit legal advocacy group that focuses on campus speech issues, publishes annual &quot;College Free Speech Rankings&quot; based on their comparative assessment of campus speech policies, tolerance for controversial speakers, administrative support for free speech, and surveys of student attitudes towards speech on campus. Since 2011, the group has also published a list of the “worst colleges for free speech.”

In the 1980s-1990s and the 2010s-2020s, public debate over campus speech policies and the status of free speech on campus often turned on the question of whether American campuses provided an open or a hostile environment for the discussion of conservative or right-wing views, or for critical debate or &quot;heterodox&quot; approaches to liberal politics or social justice activism. Journalists such as David Brooks (commentator) and Robby Soave have criticized student activists&#x27; efforts to heckle or shut down controversial invited speakers, which they argue amounts to a heckler&#x27;s veto on campus speech. The sociologist Musa al-Gharbi (writing for Heterodox Academy) and the legal advocate Greg Lukianoff (president of FIRE) have argued that college administrations have chilled or limited speech on campus through the partisan use of censorship and disciplinary proceedings that infringe on academic freedom. Other commentators such as &quot;Vox&quot;&#x27;s Zack Beauchamp have disputed the claim that American college campuses are facing a &quot;free-speech crisis,&quot; arguing that &quot;incidents of speech by students or professors being suppressed are relatively rare,&quot; and are not directed along consistent partisan lines. Chris Quintana, writing in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, argued that administration threats to academic freedom were in fact more likely to target controversial liberal professors than to be directed against conservative faculty.

=== Protections for Employees of Private Companies ===
Connecticut makes it illegal (under Connecticut General Statutes Section 31-51q) for an employer to fire an employee because of any exercise of that employee’s First Amendment rights, including the right to free speech, as long as the activity does not substantially or materially interfere with their job duties or their working relationship.

In the early 90s, the State of New York added Section 201-d to New York Labor Law. This statute prohibits discrimination on the basis of an employee’s political and recreational activities outside of working hours, off of the employer’s premises and without the use of the employer’s equipment. However, the statute permits an employer to take adverse action if the employee’s speech creates a material conflict of interest related to the employer’s trade secrets, proprietary information or other proprietary or business interest.

Colorado’s lawful off-duty conduct statute C.R.S. § 24-34-402.5 prohibits an employer from wrongfully terminating an employee because the employee engaged in any lawful activity off the premises of the employer during nonworking hours. There is an exception however: the statute authorizes employers to terminate employees for off-duty activities that are reasonably and rationally related to their employment. These are activities that are inherently connected to the individual’s employment and emanate from the employee’s job duties and the company’s business interests.

California goes further than Colorado, Connecticut and New York by generally restricting an employer’s ability to fire or demote employees for voicing views seen as controversial or even hateful, between or after work hours and away from work premises. Unlike the just mentioned three states, there is no statutory exception to this rule. California Labor Code section 96(k), allows California officials (specifically, the state labor commissioner) to represent people who were fired due to lawful conduct occurring during nonworking hours away from the employer’s premises, which includes the exercise of free speech. This is combined with Labor Code section 98.6(a), whereby an employer cannot fire an employee or in any manner discriminate, retaliate, or take any adverse action against any employee because they engaged in any conduct delineated under 96(k).

California law does not completely prohibit the termination of California employees for voicing their opinions after-hours, if this expression of speech is coupled with expressly illegal activity. One such test of 96(k) occurred with the 2021 Capitol Riots, where some California-based participants were laid off due to joining the storming of the capital. 96(k) did not apply to them due the illegality of conduct related to storming the capital.

California state courts have thus far not had to interpret 96(k)/98.6(a)-related cases when it comes to free speech. So far, there have been judge rulings on cases relating to managers dating their subordinates, destruction of company property, and employees not devoting enough time to their jobs.

<text>Clarence Alfred Gilyard Jr. (December 24, 1955 – November 23, 2022) was an American actor. He was best known to television audiences for his roles as private investigator Conrad McMasters on the legal drama series &quot;Matlock &quot;(1986–95) and Texas Ranger Jimmy Trivette on &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; (1993–2001).

Gilyard was also known for his supporting roles in the 1980s action films &quot;Top Gun,&quot; as Radar Intercept Officer &quot;Sundown&quot;, and &quot;Die Hard&quot;, as terrorist computer expert Theo. 

Gilyard was an associate professor of acting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas from 2006 until his death in 2022.

==Early life and education==
Gilyard was born into a military family in Moses Lake, Washington, on Christmas Eve, in 1955, the son of Barbara and Clarence Alfred Gilyard Sr., a U.S. Air Force officer. Gilyard was the second of six children. His family was originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, but Gilyard grew up on Air Force bases in Hawaii, Texas, and Florida. Raised primarily as a Lutheran, he became Catholic in the 1990s.

During his young adulthood, Gilyard lived in the San Bernardino suburb of Rialto, California, and attended Eisenhower High School. He was an excellent student, graduating in 1974, and afterward spent a year as an Air Force Academy cadet before leaving the service to attend Sterling College. In college, he played football, and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He also received a tennis scholarship, but dropped out of school before completing his studies.

While living with his parents during his college years, Gilyard was preoccupied with women, alcohol, and occasionally, drugs. His parents urged him to move out, so he relocated to Long Beach, California, with a friend. He attended California State University, Long Beach, majoring in acting, and worked as a waiter while seeking acting opportunities. He completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree at California State University, Dominguez Hills.

Gilyard worked with a housemate at a clothing store, where he was promoted to manager. He left this to work briefly selling industrial chemicals. In 2003, Gilyard returned to school, receiving a Master of Fine Arts in theatre performance at Southern Methodist University.

==Career==
===Actor===
In 1979, Gilyard moved to Los Angeles to become an actor. Among other work, a role in the play &quot;Bleacher Bums&quot; made him what one magazine called &quot;the first black actor to play a cheerleader&quot;, before he segued into television roles. As a character actor, Gilyard made guest appearances on TV shows such as &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, &quot;227&quot;, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;, and &quot;Riptide&quot;. In 1982–1983, Gilyard was cast in the final season of the NBC TV series &quot;CHiPs&quot; as Officer Benjamin Webster, opposite Erik Estrada. He co-starred with Jim Carrey in the 1984 NBC sitcom &quot;The Duck Factory&quot;. He appeared in a commercial for McDonald&#x27;s in 1987.

Gilyard&#x27;s movie debut in 1986 was as an F-14 Tomcat radar intercept officer, LT. (JG) Marcus &quot;Sundown&quot; Williams, in &quot;Top Gun&quot;. He was also a military man in the 1986 film &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;. He appeared in the 1988 action film &quot;Die Hard&quot; as Theo, a criminal computer expert. He also appeared as Reverend Bruce Barnes in &quot;Left Behind: The Movie&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Left Behind II: Tribulation Force&quot;.

Gilyard played the role of Ben Matlock&#x27;s private investigator, Conrad McMasters, on &quot;Matlock&quot; opposite Andy Griffith from 1989 to 1993. He replaced Kene Holliday, who was fired for his dependency on drugs and alcohol. Gilyard appeared in almost every &quot;Matlock&quot; episode starting in season 3 of the show. When the show moved from NBC to ABC for the series&#x27; seventh season, production moved from Los Angeles to Wilmington, North Carolina. Andy Griffith suggested to Gilyard that he move there, too, which he did, before departing to work on a pilot for another series at CBS the following year.

In 1993, he began another long-time co-starring role opposite Chuck Norris on &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;. Gilyard portrayed fellow Texas Ranger and best friend of Walker, James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Trivette. Gilyard had a cameo appearance in the 2005 television movie, &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire&quot;.

In 2012, after taking time off to teach, Gilyard began appearing onscreen again, mostly in independent projects. In 2014, he appeared in the religious film &quot;A Matter of Faith&quot;.

On January 17, 2016, Gilyard performed the role of Hoak Colburn onstage at the University of New Mexico&#x27;s Popejoy Hall in the Neil Simon Festival&#x27;s &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, opposite his former &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; co-star, Sheree J. Wilson.

In the 2018 edition of the football video game &quot;Madden NFL&quot;, Gilyard plays high school coach Devin Wade in the &quot;Longshot&quot; section of the game. Two years later, Gilyard reprised his role as criminal gang member Theo from &quot;Die Hard&quot;, alongside star Bruce Willis, in a commercial for Advance Auto Parts&#x27; DieHard brand of car batteries.

===Associate professor===
In 2006, Gilyard took a break from acting and became an associate professor in the College of Fine Arts – Department of Theatre at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he taught stage and screen acting. He continued to teach for many years. Following his death, the school&#x27;s film chair said &quot;Professor Gilyard was a beacon of light and strength for everyone around at UNLV&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Gilyard was married twice and had six children. His first marriage, to Catherine Dutko in 1989, ended in divorce, and he married his second wife, Elena Castillo, in 2001. He served as the consultant of the communications committee of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

After a long illness, Gilyard died at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada, on November 23, 2022, at the age of 66.

<text>Scott Arbuthnot (born August 4, 1961) is an American magician who specializes in escape-artist feats and grand illusions.

He is a third-generation magician. At 17, Scott answered an audition posting for the movie &quot;Ragtime&quot; and got the job to re-create Houdini&#x27;s stunt of escaping from a straitjacket while dangling upside-down over the streets of New York City. He was a protégé of one of world&#x27;s foremost escapists, James Randi, and joined him for his first world tour, celebrating his 18th birthday in Sydney, Australia. While in Australia, Interrante appeared with James Randi in the film &quot;Explorer&quot; and assisted in public paranormal challenges in an effort to give away US$100,000 to anyone who could produce such pre-determined paranormal events under fair and supervised conditions. Interrante has won awards from the Society of American Magicians, the International Brotherhood of Magicians and the International Magicians Society.

<text>Kidwelly () is a town and community in Carmarthenshire, southwest Wales, approximately northwest of the most populous town in the county, Llanelli. At the 2021 census the community had a population of 3,689.

It lies on the River Gwendraeth above Carmarthen Bay. The community includes Mynyddgarreg and Llangadog.

==History==
The earliest written form of the name, &#x27;Cetgueli&#x27;, is recorded by the monk, Nennius, writing in the 9th century. One theory is that the name means the land, territory, or kingdom of Cadwal. Another theory is that the name is the combination of the two words &quot;Cyd&quot; (joint) and &quot;Gweli&quot; (bed), referring to the town&#x27;s position adjoining the confluence of the rivers Gwendraeth Fawr and Gwendraeth Fach. One local legend is that Cunedda invaded the area in the 5th century but was killed and buried at a hill now called Allt Cunedda, north of Kidwelly.

The substantial and well preserved Kidwelly Castle on the north bank of the Gwendraeth Fach river and St Mary&#x27;s Church on the south side of the river were both established by the invading Normans in the early 12th century. The earliest castle on the site was a motte and bailey structure of earth and timber. During the 13th century the castle was rebuilt in stone, as part of the &#x27;ring of steel&#x27; strategy of Edward I for strengthening his control of Wales. The stone castle was built according to the latest strategic military thinking. It had a concentric design with one circuit of defensive walls set within another to allow the castle to be held even if the outer wall should fall. The great gatehouse was begun late in the 14th century but it was not completed until 1422. The castle was besieged in 1403 by forces loyal to Owain Glyndŵr as part of his rebellion aiming to reclaim Welsh independence.

A field in the neighbouring forest of Kingswood, &quot;Maes Gwenllian&quot;, is known as the location of a battle in 1136, in which Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd, sister of Owain Gwynedd and wife of Gruffydd ap Rhys, led her husband&#x27;s troops into battle against a Norman army during his absence. She is believed to have been killed either during the battle or shortly afterwards.

During the Industrial Revolution, the town became an important centre of the tinplate industry. A tinplate works was established to the north of the town in 1737, which is believed to have been only the second such works in Britain. The works closed in 1941 but some of the buildings and machinery survive; they were formerly preserved as part of the Kidwelly Industrial Museum, which closed in 2017.

In 1919 Mabel Greenwood, who lived at Kidwelly with her husband, the solicitor Harold Greenwood, was murdered by arsenic poisoning. Harold Greenwood was charged with the murder and tried at Carmarthen assizes in 1920. He was acquitted by the jury, which nevertheless upheld its view that she had been deliberately poisoned. Following the murder and trial, Harold Greenwood remarried and moved away from the area.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Kidwelly, at community (town) and county level: Kidwelly Town Council (Cyngor Tref Cydweli) and Carmarthenshire County Council (Cyngor Sir Gâr). The town council&#x27;s offices adjoin the Princess Gwenllian Community Centre on Hillfield Villas.

It is within the UK Parliament constituency of Llanelli, represented by the Welsh Labour MP Nia Griffith, and within the Welsh Assembly Constituency of Llanelli, represented by the Welsh Labour AM Lee Waters. The community is bordered by the communities of: Llandyfaelog; Llangyndeyrn; Trimsaran; Pembrey and Burry Port Town; and St Ishmael, all in Carmarthenshire.

===Administrative history===
Kidwelly was an ancient parish. The town was an ancient borough, being granted its first charter in the early 12th century. A government survey of boroughs in 1835 found that the borough corporation had very few powers. The borough was therefore left unreformed when the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed most ancient boroughs across the country into municipal boroughs.
The old borough corporation therefore continued to run the town, but was ineligible to take on additional local government functions. The corporation built itself Kidwelly Town Hall in 1877 at the junction of Causeway Street and Lady Street, to serve both as its headquarters and a covered market. The town was eventually made a municipal borough in 1885. The borough covered most, but not all, of the parish. In 1895, the parish was reduced to match the borough, with the parts of the old parish outside the borough boundary being transferred to the neighbouring parishes of Llandyfaelog, Llangyndeyrn, Pembrey and St Ishmael.

The borough of Kidwelly was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Kidwelly was created covering the area of the former borough, with its community council taking the name Kidwelly Town Council. District-level functions passed to the new Llanelli Borough Council. Carmarthenshire County Council was abolished as part of the same reforms, with county-level functions passing to the new Dyfed County Council. The borough of Llanelli and county of Dyfed were both abolished in 1996 and their councils&#x27; functions passed to a re-established Carmarthenshire County Council. After the 1974 reforms, the Town Hall served as the town&#x27;s library until 2002, but has been disused since then.

==Tourism==
Local landmarks include Kidwelly Castle, founded in 1106; a fourteenth-century bridge and gate; the former quay (now a nature reserve); and St Mary&#x27;s Church.

Kidwelly Carnival is an annual event held on the second Saturday of July. Previous carnivals have featured aerial displays.

The town is twinned with French village Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer on the north coast of Brittany.

==Transport==
Road – Kidwelly is connected to Llanelli and Carmarthen by the A484 road.

Bus/Coach – there are local buses running through Kidwelly operated by First Cymru, linking the town with Llanelli and Carmarthen, with a main stop in the town centre. Some services were withdrawn in 2014. There is a Coach Park located in the town centre.

Rail – Kidwelly railway station is on the West Wales Line. Westbound services from Kidwelly terminate at Carmarthen or Pembroke Dock, with less frequent direct services to Fishguard Harbour and Milford Haven. Eastbound services terminate at Swansea or Cardiff Central, with less frequent direct services to Manchester Piccadilly and London Paddington.

Cycling – Kidwelly is connected to the National Cycle Network along the coast from the east and west by NCR 4. The cycle path runs directly through the town centre.

Walking – There are numerous public footpaths and bridleways in Kidwelly and Mynydd-y-Garreg, including Glan yr Afon, just behind the Wesleyan Chapel on the Bridge and Summer Way (Maes yr Haf) off Water Street.

== Current Developments ==
The Kidwelly town council has recently been successful in developing the town’s numerous parks and playgrounds to encourage community participation and provide residents with safe and enjoyable public spaces, the project has seen over £250,000 invested so far.

Additionally, the town council has begun a redevelopment project to transform the town square into a greener and more convenient space. The project includes open green spaces, new toilet blocks and a more convenient street layout. The work was started in January, 2024 with the aim of completing the project by the end of May, 2024.

<text>The Basilica of Saint Sabina (, ) is a historic church on the Aventine Hill in Rome, Italy. It is a titular minor basilica and mother church of the Roman Catholic Order of Preachers, better known as the Dominicans.

Santa Sabina is the oldest extant ecclesiastical basilica in Rome that preserves its original colonnaded rectangular plan with apse and architectural style. Its decorations have been restored to their original restrained design. Other basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore, have been ornately decorated in later centuries. Because of its simplicity, the Santa Sabina represents the adaptation of the architecture of the roofed Roman forum or basilica to the basilica churches of Christendom. It is especially well-known for its cypress wood doors carved in AD 430-432 with biblical scenes, the most famous being the first known publicly displayed depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the two thieves.

Santa Sabina is perched high above the Tiber to the north and the Circus Maximus to the east. It is next to a small public park, the &quot;Giardino degli Aranci&quot; (&quot;Garden of Oranges&quot;), which has a scenic terrace overlooking Rome. It is a short distance from Santi Bonifacio ed Alessio and from the headquarters of the Knights of Malta.

Its last cardinal priest was Jozef Tomko until his death on 8 August 2022. It is the stational church for Ash Wednesday.

== History ==
The church was built on the site of early Imperial houses, one of which is said to be of Sabina, a Roman matron originally from Avezzano in the Abruzzo region of Italy. Sabina was beheaded in AD 126 under Emperor Hadrian, because she had been converted to Christianity by her servant Serapia, who also had been beheaded in AD 119. Sabina and Serapia were later declared Catholic saints.

Santa Sabina was built by Peter of Illyria, a Dalmatian priest, between 422 and 432 near a temple of Juno on the Aventine Hill in Rome.

Pope Celestine I established the cardinal title of Santa Sabina with its seat here in 423 AD.

In the 9th century, it was enclosed in a fortification area as a result of war.

in 1216 Pope Honorius III approved the Order of Preachers, now commonly known as the Dominicans, which was &quot;the first order instituted by the Church with an academic mission&quot;. Honorius III invited Saint Dominic, the founder of the Order of Preachers, to take up residence at the church of Santa Sabina in 1220. The official foundation of the Dominican convent at Santa Sabina with its &quot;studium conventuale&quot;, the first Dominican &quot;studium&quot; in Rome, occurred with the legal transfer of property from Honorius III to the Order of Preachers on 5 June 1222 though the brethren had taken up residence there already in 1220.

The church was the seat of a papal conclave in 1287, although the prelates left the church after an epidemic killed six of them. They later returned to the church, and elected Nicholas IV as pope on 22 February 1288.

Its interior was renovated by Domenico Fontana in 1587 (after being commissioned by Pope Sixtus V in 1586) and Francesco Borromini in 1643.

The Kingdom of Italy conquered Rome in 1870; expelled the Dominicans; and converted the church into a lazaretto (quarantine station for maritime travelers).

Italian architect and art historian Antonio Muñoz (1884-1960) restored the original simplistic medieval appearance of the church in 1914-1919. French architect P. Berthier completed its restoration in 1936-1938.

Among those who have lived in its adjacent convent were Saint Dominic (1220-1221), St Thomas Aquinas (1265-1268), Blessed Ceslaus, Saint Hyacinth, and Pope Pius V.

== Architecture ==

=== Exterior ===
The Minor Basilica of Santa Sabina is built in the manner of an Ancient Roman secular basilica, or covered forum. The characteristics are a long central nave with a lower aisle on each side. Above the aisles, the walls of the nave are pierced by a row of large clerestory windows. The brick walls are mostly unrendered, and the windows are made of selenite, not glass, making the building look much as it did when it was built in the 5th century.

The building has a colonnaded porch opening propped onto a cloister, and at the other end, a semi-circular apse.

The campanile (bell tower) was originally built in the 10th century; but was rebuilt in the 17th century in the Baroque style.

The wooden door of the basilica is generally agreed to be the original door from 430 – 432, although it was apparently not constructed for this doorway. Eighteen of its wooden panels survive — all but one depicting scenes from the Bible. Most famous among these is one of the earliest certain depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the two thieves. Other panels have also been the subjects of extensive analysis because of their importance to the study of Christian iconography.

Above the doorway, the interior preserves an original dedication in Latin hexameters.

=== Interior ===

The interior has basilical form, with a central nave divided from the side aisle by two rows of columns,on which rests an arcade. Above the arcade is a row of large clerestory windows. The twenty four columns of Proconnesian marble with perfectly matched Corinthian capitals and bases, were reused from the Temple of Juno. A framed hole in the floor exposes a Roman era temple column that pre-dates Santa Sabina. This appears to be the remnant of the Temple of Juno erected on the hilltop site during Roman times, which was likely razed to allow construction of the basilica.

There is an apse at the eastern end. The original fifth-century apse mosaic was replaced in 1559 by a fresco by Taddeo Zuccari. The composition probably remained unchanged: Christ is flanked by a good thief and a bad thief, seated on a hill while lambs drink from a stream at its base. The iconography of the mosaic was very similar to another 5th-century mosaic, destroyed in the 17th century, in Sant&#x27;Andrea in Catabarbara.

===Convent===
The interior cells of the Dominican convent are little changed since the earliest days of the Order of Preachers. The cell of St. Dominic is still identified, though it has since been enlarged and converted to a chapel. Also, the original dining room still remains, in which St. Thomas Aquinas would dine when he lived in Rome.
== Doors ==

The doors on the exterior of Santa Sabina are made of cypress wood, and originally had a layout of twenty-eight panels. Out of these panels, ten of the original have been lost, and are left without ornamentation.

Seventeen out of the original remaining eighteen panels depict a scene from the Old Testament or the New Testament, leaving one panel that does not directly correlate to a Biblical story. This panel, found near the bottom of the door, depicts an homage to a man wearing a chlamys, and is thought to depict a historical event relating to a powerful ruler, though the exact story depicted is unknown.

One of the smaller top panels depicts the crucifixion of Jesus and two other figures in front of a building that alludes to the architecture of a Roman mausoleum. This panel is the first known publicly displayed image of the crucifixion of Christ. The panels are carved in two distinct styles, one including more detail and adherence to the style of classical art, and one adopting a simpler style, indicating that several artists may have worked on the doors. The abstract vegetal designs on the panels&#x27; frames are consistent with a Mesopotamian style, suggesting the origin of at least one of the artists was from this region.

Due to the cramped composition of the panels and the thin outer frame, it is likely that the door was originally bigger, then cut down to fit into the frame of Santa Sabina. This makes it unclear as to whether the door was initially intended to be used for this specific structure. It may have been designed for a different Roman building with larger doorway dimensions, but then been transferred to Santa Sabina for unknown reasons.

However, the door was most likely constructed near the same time as the erection of the Church of Santa Sabina in 432, as the powerful figure in the chlamys scene carving shares stylistic similarities with depictions of Theodosius II, the emperor at the time of the consecration of Santa Sabina. Dendrochronologic and radiocarbon dating confirmed that the wood used for the door panels is from the beginning of the 5th century, therefore the carvings could date from the reigns of Celestine I (421–431) or Sixtus III (431–440).

== Convent and &quot;Studium&quot; of the Dominican Order ==

In 1216 the Order of Preachers, now commonly known as the Dominicans, was approved by Pope Honorius as &quot;the first order instituted by the Church with an academic mission&quot;. Honorius III invited Saint Dominic, the founder of the Order of Preachers, to take up residence at the church of Santa Sabina in 1220. The official foundation of the Dominican convent at Santa Sabina with its &quot;studium conventuale&quot;, the first Dominican &quot;studium&quot; in Rome, occurred with the legal transfer of property from Honorius III to the Order of Preachers on 5 June 1222, though the brethren had taken up residence there already in 1220.

Some scholars have written that Honorius III was a member of the Savelli family and that the church and associated buildings formed part of the holdings of the Savelli, thereby explaining why Honorius III donated Santa Sabina to the Dominicans. In fact, Honorius III was not a Savelli. These scholars may have confused later Pope Honorius IV, who was a Savelli, and Honorius III. In any case, the church was given over to the Dominicans and it has since then served as their headquarters in Rome.

In 1265 in accordance with the injunction of the Chapter of the Roman province of the Order of Preachers at Anagni, Thomas Aquinas was assigned as regent master at the &quot;studium conventuale&quot; at Santa Sabina: “Fr. Thome de Aquino iniungimus in remissionem peccatorum quod teneat studium Rome, et volumus quod fratribus qui stant secum ad studendum provideatur in necessariis vestimentis a conventibus de quorum predicatione traxerunt originem. Si autem illi studentes inventi fuerint negligentes in studio, damus potestatem fr. Thome quod ad conventus suos possit eos remittere”.

At this time the existing &quot;studium conventuale&quot; at Santa Sabina was transformed into the Order&#x27;s first &quot;studium provinciale&quot;, an intermediate school between the &quot;studium conventuale&quot; and the &quot;studium generale&quot;. &quot;Prior to this time the Roman Province had offered no specialized education of any sort, no arts, no philosophy; only simple convent schools, with their basic courses in theology for resident friars, were functioning in Tuscany and the meridionale during the first several decades of the order&#x27;s life. But the new &quot;studium&quot; at Santa Sabina was to be a school for the province,&quot; a &quot;studium provinciale&quot;. Tolomeo da Lucca, an associate and early biographer of Aquinas, tells us that at the Santa Sabina &quot;studium&quot; Aquinas taught the full range of philosophical subjects, both moral and natural.

With the departure of Aquinas for Paris in 1268 and the passage of time the pedagogical activities of the &quot;studium provinciale&quot; at Santa Sabina were divided between two campuses. A new convent of the Order at the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva had a modest beginning in 1255 as a community for women converts, but grew rapidly in size and importance after being given to the Dominicans in 1275.

In 1288 the theology component of the provincial curriculum was relocated from the Santa Sabina &quot;studium provinciale&quot; to the &quot;studium conventuale&quot; at Santa Maria sopra Minerva which was redesignated as a &quot;studium particularis theologiae&quot;. Thus, the &quot;studium&quot; at Santa Sabina was the forerunner of the &quot;studium generale&quot; at Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

Following the curriculum of studies laid out in the capitular acts of 1291 the Santa Sabina &quot;studium&quot; was redesignated as one of three &quot;studia nove logice&quot; intended to offer courses of advanced logic covering the &quot;logica nova&quot;, the Aristotelian texts recovered in the West only in the second half of the 12th century, the &quot;Topics&quot;, &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot;, and the &quot;Prior and Second Analytics&quot; of Aristotle. This was an advance over the &quot;logica antiqua&quot;, which treated the &quot;Isagoge&quot; of Porphyry, &quot;Divisions&quot; and &quot;Topics&quot; of Boethius, the &quot;Categories&quot; and &quot;On Interpretation&quot; of Aristotle, and the &quot;Summule logicales&quot; of Peter of Spain.

Milone da Velletri was the lector at the Santa Sabina &quot;studium&quot; in 1293. In 1310 the Florentine Giovanni dei Tornaquinci was the lector at Santa Sabina. In 1331 at the Santa Sabina &quot;studium&quot; Nerius de Tertia was the lector, and Giovanni Zocco da Spoleto was a student of logic.

<text>The Basilica of Saint Clement () is a Latin Catholic minor basilica dedicated to Pope Clement I located in Rome, Italy. Archaeologically speaking, the structure is a three-tiered complex of buildings: (1) the present basilica built just before the year 1100 during the height of the Middle Ages; (2) beneath the present basilica is a 4th-century basilica that had been converted out of the home of a Roman nobleman, part of which had in the 1st century briefly served as an early church, and the basement of which had in the 2nd century briefly served as a mithraeum; (3) the home of the Roman nobleman had been built on the foundations of republican era villa and warehouse that had been destroyed in the Great Fire of AD 64.

== History ==

This ancient church was transformed over the centuries from a private home that was the site of clandestine Christian worship in the 1st century to a grand public basilica by the 6th century, reflecting the emerging Catholic Church&#x27;s growing legitimacy and power. The archaeological traces of the basilica&#x27;s history were discovered in the 1860s by Joseph Mullooly, Prior of the house of Irish Dominicans at San Clemente (1847–1880).

=== Before the 4th century ===
The lowest levels of the present basilica contain remnants of the foundation of a possibly republican era building that might have been destroyed in the Great Fire of 64. An industrial building – probably the imperial mint of Rome from the late 1st century A.D. onwards (because a similar building is represented on a 16th-century drawing of a fragment of the Severan marble plan of the city), was built or remodelled on the same site during the Flavian period. Shortly after an &quot;insula&quot;, or apartment block, was also built. It was separated from the industrial building by a narrow alleyway. About a hundred years later (c. 200) a &quot;mithraeum,&quot; a sanctuary of the cult of Mithras, was built in the courtyard of the &quot;insula.&quot; The main cult room (the &quot;speleum&quot;, &quot;cave&quot;), which is about 9.6m long and 6m wide, was discovered in 1867 but could not be investigated until 1914 due to lack of drainage. The &quot;exedra&quot;, the shallow apse at the far end of the low vaulted space, was trimmed with pumice to render it more cave-like.

Central to the main room of the sanctuary was found an altar, in the shape of a sarcophagus, and with the main cult relief of the tauroctony (the image of Mithras slaying a bull) on its front face. The torchbearers Cautes and Cautopates appear on respectively the left and right faces of the same monument. A dedicatory inscription identifies the donor as one &quot;pater&quot; Cnaeus Arrius Claudianus, perhaps of the same clan as Titus Arrius Antoninus&#x27; mother. Other monuments discovered in the sanctuary include a bust of Sol kept in the sanctuary in a niche near the entrance, and a figure of , i.e. Mithras born of the rock. Fragments of statuary of the two torch bearers were also found . One of the rooms adjoining the main chamber has two oblong brickwork enclosures, one of which was used as a ritual refuse pit for remnants of the cult meal. All three monuments mentioned above are still on display in the mithraeum. A fourth monument – a statue of St. Peter found in the &quot;speleum&quot;&#x27;s vestibule and still on display there – is not of the mysteries.

===4th–11th century===
At some time in the 4th century, the lower level of the industrial building was filled in with dirt and rubble and its second floor remodeled. An apse was built out over part of the domus, whose lowest floor, with the Mithraeum, was also filled in. This &quot;first basilica&quot; is known to have existed in 392, when St. Jerome wrote of the church dedicated to St. Clement, i.e. Pope Clement I, a 1st-century AD Christian convert and previously considered by patrologists and ecclesiastical historians to be identical with Titus Flavius Clemens. Restorations were undertaken in the 9th century and ca 1080–99.

The early basilica was the site of councils presided over by Pope Zosimus (417) and Symmachus (499). The last major event that took place in the lower basilica was the election in 1099 of Cardinal Rainerius of St Clemente as Pope Paschal II.
Apart from those in Santa Maria Antiqua, the largest collection of Early Medieval wall paintings in Rome is to be found in the lower basilica of San Clemente.

Four of the largest frescoes in the basilica were sponsored by a lay couple, Beno de Rapiza and Maria Macellaria, at some time in the last third of the 11th century and focus on the life, miracles, and translation of St. Clement, and on the life of St. Alexius. Beno and Maria are shown in two of the compositions, once on the façade of the basilica together with their children, Altilia and Clemens (, i.e. &quot;little boy Clement&quot;), offering gifts to St. Clement, and on a pillar on the left side of the nave, where they are portrayed on a small scale witnessing a miracle performed by St. Clement. Below this last scene is one of the earliest examples of the passage from Latin to vernacular Italian: a fresco of the pagan Sisinnius and his servants, who think they have captured St. Clement but are dragging a column instead. Sisinnius encourages the servants in Italian , which, translated into English means: &quot;Come on, you sons of bitches, pull! Come on, Gosmari, Albertello, pull! Carvoncello, give it to him from the back with the pole!&quot; The saint speaks in Latin, in a cross-shaped inscription: , which means &quot;You deserved to drag stones due to the hardness of your hearts.&quot;

Art historians have long regarded Beno de Rapiza and Maria Macellaria as partisans of the now-canonical &#x27;reform&#x27; popes Gregory VII, Urban II, and Paschal II and the frescoes as reform-party propaganda. However, if the paintings date to the 1080s or 1090s, as many art historians believe, then Beno and Maria may instead have favoured the Antipope Clement III (Wibert of Ravenna), whom they sought to honour through paintings about the early Christian pope of the same name.

=== The second basilica ===

The current basilica was rebuilt in one campaign by Cardinal Anastasius, ca 1099-ca. 1120. A now-outdated hypothesis held that the original church had burned out during the Norman sack of the city under Robert Guiscard in 1084, but no evidence of fire damage in the lower basilica has been found to date. One possible explanation is that the lower basilica was filled in and the new church built on top due to the close association of the lower structure with the imperial opposition pope (&quot;antipope&quot;) Clement III / Wibert of Ravenna. Today, it is one of the most richly adorned churches in Rome. The ceremonial entrance (a side entrance is ordinarily used today) is through an atrium (&quot;B&quot; on plan) surrounded by arcades, which now serves as a cloister, with conventual buildings surrounding it. Fronting the atrium is the chaste facade of Carlo Stefano Fontana (nephew of Carlo Fontana), supported on antique columns, and his little campanile (&quot;illustration&quot;). The basilica church behind it is in three naves divided by arcades on ancient marble or granite columns, with Cosmatesque inlaid paving. The 12th-century schola cantorum (&quot;E&quot; on plan) incorporates marble elements from the original basilica. Behind it, in the presbytery is a ciborium (&quot;H&quot; on plan) raised on four gray-violet columns over the shrine of Clement in the crypt below. The episcopal seat stands in the apse, which is covered with mosaics on the theme of the &quot;Triumph of the Cross&quot; that are a high point of Roman 12th century mosaics.


Irish Dominicans have owned the Basilica of San Clemente and the surrounding building complex since 1667. Pope Urban VIII gave them refuge at San Clemente, where they have remained, running a residence for priests () studying and teaching in Rome. The Dominicans themselves conducted the excavations in the 1950s in collaboration with Italian archaeology students.

On one wall in the atrium is a plaque affixed by Pope Clement XI in 1715, praising the Basilica of St. Clement, &quot;This ancient church has withstood the ravages of the centuries.&quot; Clement undertook restorations to the venerable structure, which he found dilapidated. He selected Carlo Stefano Fontana as architect, who erected a new facade, completed in 1719. The carved and gilded coffered ceilings of nave and aisles, fitted with paintings, date from this time, as do the stucco decor, Ionic capitals and frescos.

The inscriptions found in S. Clemente, a valuable source illustrating the history of the Basilica, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.

In one lateral chapel, there is a shrine with the tomb of Saint Cyril of the Saints Cyril and Methodius, who translated the Bible into Slavic language, created the Glagolitic alphabet, and Christianized the Slavs. Pope John Paul II used to pray there sometimes for Poland and the Slavic countries. The chapel also holds a Madonna by Giovanni Battista Salvi da Sassoferrato.

The current position of Cardinal Priest of the &quot;Titulus S. Clementi&quot; is Arrigo Miglio. Pope Paschal II (1076–1099) was one of the previous holders of the &quot;titulus&quot;.

During the Second World War, Jewish religious services were conducted in the Basilica di San Clemente, since it was under Irish diplomatic protection, under a painting of Tobias.

* The crypto-thriller &quot;The Sword of Moses&quot; by Dominic Selwood (Corax, London, 2013, ) has several scenes set on all three levels of the Basilica di San Clemente: the upper basilica, the lower basilica, and the Roman mithraeum.
* The fictional poem &quot;San Clemente Syndrome&quot; – also the title of the third part – in &quot;Call Me By Your Name&quot; is named after the church by the poet Elio meets in at a book store in B. and once again at a book party in Rome.

<text>Drukqs (stylised as drukQs) is the fifth studio album by the British electronic music artist and producer Richard D. James under the alias of Aphex Twin. It was released in October 2001 through Warp Records. It is a double album that includes a variety of contrasting styles, from meticulously programmed beats inspired by jungle and drum and bass, to classical-type piano and prepared piano, ambient, and electroacoustic pieces. It features the piano composition &quot;Avril 14th&quot;, one of James&#x27;s best known recordings.

James released &quot;Drukqs&quot; to pre-empt a potential leak after he accidentally left an MP3 player containing his music on a plane. It was intended to be his final release with Warp, in accordance with his label contract. The record entered the Dance Albums Chart at No.1, remaining in the top 10 for five weeks, and entered at No.22 on the Albums Chart. It received polarised reviews from critics: many dismissed it, focusing on its perceived lack of innovation and similarity to James&#x27;s previous works, while some praised it as an accomplished work.

==Background and release==
James released &quot;Drukqs&quot; to circumvent a potential leak after he accidentally left an MP3 player containing 180 unreleased tracks on a plane while travelling to Scotland. According to James: &quot;I thought, &#x27;They&#x27;re gonna fucking come on the internet sooner or later so I may as well get an album out of it first.&#x27;&quot; James had no intent to release any of the record&#x27;s tracks to the public prior to the incident. He intended it to be his final release as part of his contractual obligation to Warp. The album was mastered in early July 2001. It was released as a double CD album on 22 October 2001.

The record entered the Dance Albums Chart at No.1, remaining in the top 10 for five weeks, and entered at No.22 on the Albums Chart.

Many track names are written in Cornish—for example, &quot;Jynweythek&quot; (&quot;Machine&quot;) — or are coded titles. James has stated that the title is not related to drugs, and is &quot;just a word [he] made up.&quot; About the album&#x27;s two-disc length, James said &quot;the way I listen to music now is that I buy a CD, put it on the computer and just take the tracks I want anyway. I&#x27;d hope that people would do the same with this CD.&quot;

==Music==
The LP is a double album featuring a variety of styles: rapid, meticulously-programmed tracks utilising exaggerated drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass breakbeats, ambient, electroacoustic, and piano and prepared piano pieces inspired by classical music made using computer-controlled instruments such as a modified Yamaha Disklavier and several MIDI-controlled, solenoid-based drum mechanisms made by James. &quot;Drukqs&quot; includes music in the genres of drill &#x27;n&#x27; bass, jungle, classical, electroacoustic, acid, drum and bass, techno, IDM and ambient. It contains tracks dating back &quot;seven or eight years&quot;, according to James, though most of the album was relatively new. &quot;Keymag&quot; described it as &quot;switching restlessly from his most acidic drill &#x27;n&#x27; bass yet to incredibly lavish prepared piano pieces inspired by John Cage.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; noted that the album moves through techno, drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass, and early-90s rave, while the piano interludes were compared to the work of Erik Satie. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; also noted &quot;several purely electro-acoustic excursions&quot;.

James said that &quot;A lot of [the tracks] are quite old-style sounding, I reckon. I’ve done loads of tracks which are really new in style and which don’t sound like anything else but I didn’t want to release those tracks.&quot; While acknowledging similarities with his past records, James said that &quot;I haven’t done something in so much detail before.&quot; Of the album&#x27;s complex drum programming, he said &quot;it&#x27;s quite similar to guitar solos, only with programming you have to use your brain. The most important thing is that it should have some emotional effect on me, rather than just, &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s really clever.&#x27;&quot;

In 2015 James released the EP &quot;Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2&quot;, featuring further computer-controlled instrumental tracks, as a sequel to &quot;Drukqs&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Drukqs&quot; is among James&#x27;s most divisive releases, with Oli Warwick of &quot;Crack&quot; noting that it provoked &quot;widespread indignation amongst music critics, whose primary criticism seemed to be that James had delivered something reminiscent of previous releases, rather than some bold new mode of electronic expression.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 66 based on 21 reviews.

On its 2001 release, Alex Needham of &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;bulging with goodies&quot;. The review for &quot;Playlouder&quot; called it &quot;probably his best album to date&quot;. For &quot;Spin&quot;, Simon Reynolds criticised the album as &quot;unimpressive&quot; and &quot;trapped by the potential for infinitesimal tweakage,&quot; stating that it &quot;sounds merely like a slight extension of the Aphex sound circa 1996&#x27;s &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; and 1997&#x27;s &quot;Come to Daddy&quot;.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described the album&#x27;s &quot;drill&#x27;n&#x27;bass&quot; tracks as &quot;throwbacks to the past rather than prospects on the future; and for all of their compositional strength, there&#x27;s an element of the Aphex Twin mystique missing.&quot; Dave Simpson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;much of &quot;Drukqs&quot; sounds like weaker echoes of things Aphex Twin has done before, which no manner of hyperactive drum machines or daft titles can disguise.&quot; Pat Blashill of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Drukqs&quot; Aphex&#x27;s &quot;most irrelevant album to date&quot;, and added &quot;rumor has it that James merely loaded this record with outtakes that have been eating up space on his hard drive for years, then released the album as a deal-breaker with his label, Warp.&quot; In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), critic Sasha Frere-Jones wrote &quot;weirdly dismissed by many, &quot;Drukqs&quot; is often spectacular&quot;.

The piano composition &quot;Avril 14th&quot; became one of James&#x27;s most popular tracks, later being used in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit and the Kanye West song &quot;Blame Game&quot;. As of April 2017 the track was James&#x27;s most streamed track on Spotify, with approximately 124 million streams. By this metric, it is his best-known composition. &quot;Avril 14th&quot; has also been used in films such as &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006). &quot;QKThr&quot; has also seen widespread use as a TikTok sound, primarily in relation to the &#x27;subtle foreshadowing&#x27; trend, where a video&#x27;s unfortunate ending is slowed down and spliced throughout the video itself.

<text>was a World War II German assault gun built on the Tiger I chassis and armed with a 380mm rocket-propelled mortar. The official German designation was . Its primary task was to provide heavy fire support for infantry units fighting in urban areas. The few vehicles produced fought in the Warsaw Uprising, the Battle of the Bulge and the Battle of the Reichswald. The fighting vehicle was known by various informal names, among which the became the most popular.

==Development==
The idea for a heavy infantry support vehicle capable of demolishing heavily defended buildings or fortified areas with a single shot came out of the experiences of the heavy urban fighting in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. At the time, the Wehrmacht had only the available for destroying buildings, a variant armed with a 15 cm sIG 33 heavy infantry gun. Twelve of them were lost in the fighting at Stalingrad. Its successor, the , also known by Allies as , was in production from early 1943. This was essentially an improved version of the earlier design, mounting the same gun on the Panzer IV chassis with greatly improved armour protection.

While greatly improved compared to the earlier models, by this time infantry anti-tank weapons were improving dramatically, and the Wehrmacht still saw a need for a similar, but more heavily armoured and armed vehicle. Therefore, a decision was made to create a new vehicle based on the Tiger tank and arm it with a 210 mm howitzer. However, this weapon turned out not to be available at the time and was therefore replaced by a 380 mm rocket launcher, which was adapted from a depth charge launcher.

In September 1943 plans were made for Krupp to fabricate new Tiger I armoured hulls for the . The Tiger I hulls were to be sent to Henschel for chassis assembly and then to Alkett where the superstructures would be mounted. The first prototype was ready and presented to Adolf Hitler in October 1943. Delivery of the first hulls would occur in December 1943, with the first three completed by Alkett by 20 February 1944.

Due to delays, Hitler did not request production of the weapon until 19 April 1944; twelve superstructures and weapons would be prepared and mounted on rebuilt Tiger I chassis. The first three production series were completed by Alkett in August 1944. Plans to complete an additional seven from 15 to 21 September 1944 were presented to Hitler in a conference on 18–20 August 1944. Ten were produced in September, along with an additional five in December 1944.

Hitler had laid great importance on the special employment of the and believed it would be necessary to produce at least 300 rounds of ammunition per month.

==Design==
The was based on the late model Tiger I, keeping its hull and suspension. The front of the Tiger&#x27;s superstructure was removed to make room for the new fixed casemate-style fighting compartment housing the rocket launcher. This was located directly at the front of the vehicle, giving it a boxy appearance.

Compared to the Tiger tank, the was much shorter overall, only compared to the Tiger&#x27;s , due largely to the fact that it did not have the long main gun of the latter which protruded far in front of the hull. It also was slightly lower than the Tiger at compared to .

===Armour===
Since the was intended for use in urban areas in close range street fighting, it needed to be heavily armoured to survive. Its sloped (at 47° from vertical) frontal armor therefore was thick, while its superstructure side and rear plates were thick. The hull front was or if it had an additional armor plate fitted. This pushed the weight of the vehicle up from the of the Tiger I to .

===Armament===
The main armament was the 380 mm 61 L/5.4, a breech-loading barrel, which fired a short-range, rocket-propelled projectile roughly long. There were a variety of round types with a weight of up to , and a maximum range of up to , which either contained a high explosive charge of or a shaped charge for use against fortifications, which could penetrate up to of reinforced concrete. The stated range of the former was . A normal charge first accelerated the projectile to , the rocket charge then boosted this to about .

The design of the rocket system caused some problems. The hot rocket exhaust could not be vented into the fighting compartment nor could the barrel withstand the pressure if the gasses were not vented. Therefore, a ring of ventilation shafts was put around the barrel which channeled the exhaust and gave the weapon something of a pepperbox appearance.

Due to the bulkiness of the ammunition, only fourteen rounds could be carried internally, of which one was already loaded, with another in the loading tray. The rest were carried in two storage racks. To help with the loading of ammunition into the vehicle, a loading crane was fitted at the rear of the superstructure next to the loading hatch. Even then, the entire five-man crew had to help with the loading.

It was intended that each would be accompanied by an ammunition carrier built on the same Tiger I chassis, but only one carrier was completed.

Located at the rear of the loading hatch was a launcher which was used for close defence against infantry in addition to a frontal mounted 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun.

==Combat service==
The was intended to serve as a heavy infantry support vehicle, rendering assistance with attacks on heavily fortified or built-up areas. By the time the first were available, however, Germany had lost the initiative, with the Wehrmacht being almost exclusively on the defensive rather than the offensive.

Three new Panzer companies were raised to operate the : (&quot;Armored Assault Mortar Company&quot;) 1000, 1001 and 1002. These originally were supposed to be equipped with fourteen vehicles, but this figure was later reduced to four each, divided into two platoons.

&quot;PzStuMrKp&quot; 1000 was raised on 13 August 1944 and fought during the Warsaw Uprising with two vehicles, as did the prototype in a separate action, which may have been the only time the was used in its intended role. &quot;PzStuMrKp&quot; 1001 (commanded by Captain von Gottberg) and 1002 (commanded by Lieutenant Zippel) followed in September and October. Both &quot;PzStuMrKp&quot; 1000 and 1001 served during the Ardennes Offensive, with a total of seven .

After this offensive, the were used in the defence of Germany, mainly on the Western Front.

During the battle for the bridge at Remagen, German forces mobilized 1000 and 1001 (a total of 7 units) to take part in the battle. The were originally tasked with using their mortars against the bridge itself, though it was discovered that they lacked the accuracy needed to hit the bridge. During this action, one of the Sturmtigers in 1001 near Düren and Euskirchen allegedly hit a group of stationary Sherman tanks in a village with a 380mm round, resulting in nearly all the Shermans being put out of action, and their crews killed or wounded. This is the only tank-on-tank combat a is ever recorded engaging in.

==Survivors==
*A (chassis number 250174) is on display at the at Munster. This vehicle is currently on loan from the in Koblenz which acquired it from the Aberdeen Proving Ground Collection.
*A (chassis number 205543) is on display at the Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia. This vehicle is believed to have been captured by advancing Red Army units in the Elbe area in April 1945.
*A 380 mm (rocket launcher) is in the collection of the Bovington Tank Museum.

<doc id="634909" wikidata="Q2347528" url="?curid=634909" title="Llantwit Major">
<text>Llantwit Major () is a town and community in Wales on the Bristol Channel coast. It is one of four towns in the Vale of Glamorgan, with the third largest population (13,366 in 2001) after Barry and Penarth, and ahead of Cowbridge. It is from Cowbridge, from Bridgend, from Barry, and from Cardiff. It had a population of 9,530 in 2021.

&quot;Llanilltud Fawr&quot;, named for the Llan (land) of Saint Illtud, was home to the Monastery of Illtud and the college known as Bangor Illtyd. It became one of the most esteemed centres of Christian culture in the Celtic world. At its peak it had over 2,000 students, including princes, eminent clergymen, and revered saints. The institutions were destroyed by the raiding Vikings in 987, but Normans rebuilt the monastery in 1111 and it continued to be a centre of learning until it was disbanded in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The 13th-century St Illtyd&#x27;s Church, near the ancient monastery, is a Grade I listed building and one of Wales&#x27;s oldest parish churches.

In the 20th century, the modern town developed rapidly to accommodate Royal Air Force personnel from the St Athan base. Remnants of the medieval cobbled streets can be seen adjacent to the 12th-century Old Swan Inn, and numerous buildings of the 15th and 16th centuries remain.

Colhugh Beach is a popular surfing venue and has the remnants of an Iron Age fort and some of Wales&#x27; finest examples of Jurassic Period fossils. The pebble beach and its clifftops are protected as part of the Glamorgan Heritage Coast, which stretches for from Gileston to the east to Southerndown and Newton Point to the west.

==Etymology==
The parish church accurately glosses the Welsh name of the town rather literally as &quot;Illtud&#x27;s Great Church&quot;. However, the name used in English means &quot;Greater&quot;. The epithet &quot;fawr&quot; distinguishes this Llantwit from Llantwit Fardre (&#x27;) near Pontypridd and Llantwit Minor (&#x27;; also known as Llantwit-juxta-Neath and Lower Llantwit) near Neath. The Welsh place-name element &quot;llan&quot; referred to the sanctified community around early Christian settlements in Wales and its parish rather than merely the church itself (&quot;&quot;).

==History==
===Prehistory===
Llantwit Major has been inhabited for over 3,000 years: archaeological evidence has shown that it was occupied in Neolithic times. The remains of an Iron Age fort are in its beach area.

===Roman villa===

The Roman villa at Caermead () remains as faint earthworks in a field, near the 13th-century parish church of St Illtud. The L-shaped courtyard villa was discovered in 1888. Records from 1893 suggest that one room was used as a praetorium, another as a workshop; and there was a 5th-century adjoining sacristy, simple in style, which featured a chancel, nave, and stone altar. Found remains included Brachycephalic and dolichocephalic skulls, as well as horse bones. Fine mosaic floors are a notable feature of the villa. The tesserae included blue and crystalline limestone, green volcanic stones, brown sandstone, and red-brick cuttings, encircled with a red, white, blue and brown border. A record from 1907 described the relics as Samian ware pieces; bronze coins of Maximinus Thrax, Victorinus, and Constantius Chlorus; as well as roofing materials.

The site was again excavated between 1938 and 1948. It may have been first settled in the 1st century, but the first stone structure was not erected until a hundred years later. The site developed slowly and, it has been suggested, was even abandoned for a while during the 3rd century. By the 4th century, there was an L-shaped villa with a large, aisled building possibly for farm workers, and a number of smaller agricultural structures almost enclosing a central courtyard. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales has associated collection records of the site, including drawings of other remains such as statues and a tessellated pavement, as well as documentation of a 1971 excavation. An early-medieval-period cemetery is in evidence, as are earthworks, traces of walling, a bank and a ditch. Pieces of pottery have been found.

===Côr Tewdws===
According to the 18th-century historian of ill-repute, Iolo Morganwg, the Côr Tewdws or &#x27;College of Theodosius&#x27; was established in the late 4th century at a place at or near Llantwit Major called Caer Worgorn by co-founders, Emperor Theodosius and Custennin Fendigaid but was later burnt to the ground by Irish pirates and abandoned. Morganwg&#x27;s works have since been discredited.

===Saint Illtud&#x27;s College===
Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus of Troyes made at least one visit to Britain in AD 429 and founded or refounded a number of ecclesiastic establishments across South Wales. It was at this time that Saint Illtud came to the Hodnant valley. Although he is said to have been born in Brittany, Illtud had fought as a soldier in Wales before renouncing his former life at the behest of Saint Cadoc. What is certain is that Illtud oversaw the growth of a pioneering monastery and associated college called Bangor Illtyd, on the Ogney Brook, close to the current St Illtyd&#x27;s Church. Together these institutions became the first great hub of Celtic Christianity and teaching.

Under Illtud and his successors, Bangor Illtyd and the monastery grew in reputation both as the origin of many prominent Celtic evangelists and as a major centre of scholarly education. As such, it began to attract scholars from across the Celtic and wider world. The college itself was said to be the oldest in the world, consisting of seven halls, 400 houses and more than 2,000 students at its peak, including seven sons of British princes, and scholars such as St. Patrick, St. Paul Aurelian, the bard Taliesin, Gildas the historian, Samson of Dol, and St. David are believed to have spent some time there. Samson was known to have been summoned by Dyfrig to join the monastery in 521 and he was briefly elected abbot before leaving for Cornwall. King Hywel ap Rhys (d. 886) was buried at the monastery.

===Norman and early modern eras===
The college suffered during the invasions of the Saxons and the Danes and was destroyed by the Vikings in 987 and again by the Normans in the late 11th century. However, in 1111, it is documented as being restored, but likely in a lesser state than the original. It is known to have continued to function as a monastic school until the 16th-century Reformation. The ruins of the original school house are located in a garden on the northern end of the churchyard and the monastic halls were located in a place called Hill-head on the north side of the tithe-barn. Although nothing of the original monastery remains, the present church was originally built between 950 and 1400 and its earliest existing secular buildings date from the 15th century. The church and school became the property of Tewkesbury Abbey around 1130 after becoming part of the Norman kingdom of Glamorgan.

After the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII during the Reformation, it became independent from Tewkesbury in 1539. St Donat&#x27;s Castle, to the west, was built in the 13th century.

===Modern era===
In the 20th century, Llantwit developed into a dormitory town and grew about 15 times in size to accommodate the Royal Air Force at St Athan. Despite its modernization and rapid growth, it retains its pre-modern feel with its narrow winding streets, high walls, old town hall and gatehouse, and several inns and houses dated to the 16th century. Llantwit Major railway station on the Vale of Glamorgan Line was reopened in June 2005. In 2014, it was rated one of the most attractive postcode areas to live in Wales.

Llantwit Major is located in southeast Wales and mid-west along the coast of the Vale of Glamorgan. The town can be accessed from the north directly by the B4268 road and indirectly by the B4270 road (St. Athan road) which branches from the A48 road, and directly by the B4265 road which leads to Bridgend in the northwest and Cardiff Airport and Barry in the east. It is one of four towns in the Vale of Glamorgan with the third largest population after Barry and Penarth, and ahead of Cowbridge, which is about to the northeast. Llantwit Major is about from Bridgend, 10 miles from Barry and about from Cardiff. Boverton is an eastern suburb of Llantwit.

The River Ogney, runs through the town and joins the streams [Hoddnant and Boverton Brook] which flow in from Eglwys Brewis in the northeast; these then merge and become the Afon Colhuw, which meanders down the Colhuw meadows before discharging through an outfall into the sea. The Llantwit Major area is built on a range of different levels and the town itself is sloping. At the lower coastal level is the flat, glacial Colhugh Valley, marked by steep cliffs on both sides, leading to a pebble beach. The beach, located to the south of the town (), has the remains of an ancient old stone wall from the large Iron Age hill fort, Castle Ditches. The steep cliffs at Llantwit which allow walks along the coast to St Donat&#x27;s Castle and Atlantic College have undergone dramatic erosion in recent years: in many places, the rock structure has collapsed in piles, particularly on the eastern face.

The cliff path, once set about from the edge is now within metres of the nature pathway, and the Vale of Glamorgan Council has installed extensive new barriers to prevent fatalities. The of coastline from Gileston in the east to Newton Point in the west, passing through St Donat&#x27;s and Southerndown, is protected as part of the Glamorgan Heritage Coast. Tresilian Bay is between Llantwit Major and St Donat&#x27;s. Along this stretch of coast the cliff path winds through numerous valleys. Llantwit Major beach has one of the finest sites in Wales for Jurassic fossils, including corals, giant brachiopods, gastropods and the bones of Ichthyosaurus.

The beach is popular with summer tourists, and has a campsite on the nearby fields. The beach has a snack bar and restaurant and associated amenities to cater for the increased public demand in recent years. There is an expansive rocky beach at low tide, with a stretch of sand towards the far west, and views of the Bristol Channel and the coastline of Somerset, with the landmark white roof of Butlins, Minehead.

==Economy==
Llantwit Major is a small town which is largely dependent on local retail and earnings from further afield. The majority of the inhabitants commute to work elsewhere, especially Cardiff or Bridgend. During the summer months tourism is important to the town which has &quot;The Precinct&quot;, Rainbow Plaza and several pubs and restaurants. Of note are the Old Swan Inn, Old White Hart Inn, The Tudor Tavern, and the 17th century West House Country Hotel Heritage Restaurant.

Llantwit Major railway station on the Vale of Glamorgan Line reopened in June 2005. Passenger services are operated by Transport for Wales as part of the Valleys &amp; Cardiff Local Routes network.

Although it is much less known than Porthcawl further down the coast, Llantwit Major has considerable renown in South Wales as a surfing location. The beach has a lifeguard station funded by the Vale of Glamorgan Council, built in the late 1990s, functioning during the summer months. There is a beach cafe and often organised walks.

The Victorian Fair Day, established in 1983, is usually held in June on the Saturday nearest to the 22nd of the month, with a Victorian theme which attracts people from across southern Wales. The town has several supermarkets including Co-op Food and Filco, and a town library. The local artistic community supports a number of arts and crafts shops, some selling locally made pottery and other ceramics.

==Governance==
A Llantwit Major electoral ward exists, covering Llantwit Major community but also stretching west to St. Donats. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 10,621. Since 2008 the ward has been represented my councillors from the local interest party, Llantwit First Independents.

The town is governed by the Llantwit Major town council consisting of fifteen councillors. There are fifteen independent councillors. At the May 2017 elections Llantwit First Independents won 12 of the seats. Councillor Mrs Jayne Norman was elected Mayor of Llantwit Major Town Council on 11 May 2017. Llantwit Major also comes under the administration of the Vale of Glamorgan unitary authority. Llantwit Major is twinned with Le Pouliguen, France.

====St Illtyd&#x27;s Church and monastery====

The foundation of St. Illtyd&#x27;s Church dates back to the Age of the Saints in early Welsh Christianity and thus by its very existence provides evidence of continuity with sub-Roman Christianity. The town grew up around the &quot;Bangor Illtyd&quot; (&quot;Illtyd&#x27;s college&quot;). Saint David, Saint Samson, Saint Paul Aurelian, Saint Gildas, Saint Tudwal, Saint Baglan and king Maelgwn Gwynedd are said to have studied at the divinity school. It was founded around AD 508 by St Illtyd as a centre of learning. The school is said to have stood on the north side of the churchyard; and the monastery was situated north of the tithe barn on Hill Head.

The elongated church (), a conglomeration of distinct buildings, is divided into two areas by a wall, a 13th-century monastery church, and the Norman parish church. The eastern section contains interesting medieval wall paintings with religious themes, and a fine reredos. The western section, a Lady chapel, in length, contains a small museum housing the Llanilltud Collection of Celtic Stones, including a pillar and two inscribed stones of major importance. One commemorates King Rhys ab Arthfael of Morgannwg who died in the mid-9th century. The church contains a curfew bell and medieval priest effigies. The older church is long; the newer church was built by Richard Neville. The grounds also include a 13th-century gatehouse, a monks&#x27; pigeon-house, ruined walls in a garden area, and mounds near the vicarage.

==== Town Hall====
Manorial records indicate that the Town Hall () dates to the 15th century but it is often attributed to Gilbert de Clare, Lord of Glamorgan, who died much earlier in 1295. It then functioned as a manor and a meeting venue for the court to organise duties and collect rents and at weekends held fairs. It was renovated in the late 16th century and over the years the lower floor functioned as a school, a slaughterhouse and a jail and the top floor a venue for church meetings, leased to Oddfellows in the 1830s. Aside from fairs it also held plays, concerts and dances. It became a Grade: II* listed building on 22 February 1963. It features a bell with the inscription, &quot;Sancte Iltute, ora pro nobis&quot; (&quot;Saint Illtyd, pray for us&quot;). It is reached by a flight of steps.

==== Great House====

The Great House (), located along the road to Cowbridge, on the northern outskirts originally dated from the 14th century when it consisted of just a square central section, but significant additions have made it an excellent example of a Tudor &quot;Ty mawr&quot; (Great House). A northern wing with a stable and dovecot were amongst the added parts. The house was occupied by the Nicholl family for centuries but by the 1920s it had been abandoned and fell into a heavily dilapidated state. The building was bought and restored to its former glory in the 1950s.

==== Dove cote and gatehouse====
Covered by a domical vault, the Dove Cote () is a Grade II* listed tall 13th-century cylindrical column in a middle of the Hill Head field, which lies in close proximity to St Illtuds Church, next to the site of the old tithe barn, built for the monks at the St. Illtud&#x27;s monastery. Another site on Hill Head is the (13th–14th century) gatehouse, now belonging to St Illtyd&#x27;s Church, Llantwit Major. Today these are the only remaining buildings which at one time belonged to Tewkesbury Abbey. There is a plaque on the gatehouse, telling of its history.

====The Old Place====

The Old Place () is a ruin of an Elizabethan manor house, built by Griffith Williams for his daughter and son-in-law Edmund Vann in 1596. It is often mistakenly called Llantwit Castle. The Williams family were successful lawyers and part of the rising minor gentry who were loathed by the Seys of Boverton and the Stradlings of St Donats. Vann was fined over £1,000 for being involved in a scuffle in central Llantwit on a Sunday which led him to take on the Sey family and seek his revenge.

==== Old Swan Inn====

Records state that a building was located here from the 11th century and during medieval times it is believed to have been a monastic or manorial mint. but the current Grade II* listed inn () is dated to the 16th century, aside from restoration work; it was once thatched roofed. It was run for many years in Tudor times by the Raglan family. In the mid 17th century there is evidence that its owner Edward Craddock was again using it as a mint to &quot;mint his own tokens as there was a shortage of coin at this time.&quot; There are five other pubs and four restaurants in the town.

====The Old White Hart Inn====
The Old White Hart Inn is Grade II listed, and described as a late 16th-century building. It has been suspected that the building was previously used as a courthouse, but this has never been proved. Moreover, tokens were given out under the Old White Hart&#x27;s name in the 18th century.

====Plymouth House====
According to the blue plaque on the wall outside Plymouth House (), the house is believed to have been formerly part of the monastery, perhaps functioning as a halled house for some time in the fifteenth century. After its closure in 1539, it became the manor house of West Llantwit owned by Edward Stradling. Later owners include Lewis of the Van, the Earl of Plymouth and then Dr. J. W. Nicholl Carne, who renamed it after its previous owner some time in the 19th century.

====Court House====
From the blue plaque on the Court House (), it was formerly known as Ivy house when it was a town house from the 16th century. In the 18th century it was extended by Christopher Bassett. For some time it was owned by the Throckmorton family of Coughton Court, Warwickshire, descendants of one of the perpetrators of the Gunpowder Plot. Later owners included Daniel Durrell, headmaster of Cowbridge Grammar School, and the benefactor of Tabernacle Chapel, Elias Bassett. It then fell to his niece and her husband William Thomas and became part of the Thomas family and at one time was owned by Illtyd Thomas, father of Mare Treveleyan, an antiquarian. The Thomases built the Town Hall clock to commemorate Queen Victoria.

====Knolles Place====

According to the blue plaque on the building (also known as &quot;The Old School&quot;) (), it was built around 1450 by John Raglan (Herbert) and was then owned by Robert Raglan, from a family who had significant power in the area at the time and held many local administrative posts as stewards and priests. In the 17th century it became a vicarage for Stephen Slugg and functioned as a boarding school for primary school children between 1874 and 1975.

====Old police station====
The old police station () was built in the mid-1840s after the place is Glamorgan Constabulary was established in 1841, and was originally comprised a single-storey building, but was expanded in 1876 to include four bedrooms on the top floor.
 It continued to function as a police station until 1928 when a new building opened nearer the town centre on Wesley Street.

====War memorial====
This is located in the centre of Llantwit War Memorial (), between the Old Swan and the White Hart and has a Celtic cross. The memorial commemorates residents who lost their lives or went missing in World War I and World War II. There are 32 names listed for World War I and 26 names for World War II.

====Bethel Baptist Church====

Bethel Baptist Church () was erected in 1830 to provide for local Baptists and its first minister was a local shopkeeper named Jabez Lawrence. Christmas Evans, a one-eyed Welsh preacher of considerable renown was reported to have held services here.

==== Boverton Place====
Located in Boverton, Boverton Place () is a former fortified manor house, now in ruins. It was built at the end of the 16th century and served as the seat of Roger Seys, Queen&#x27;s Attorney to the Council of Wales and the Marches in the 1590s. It remained in Seys family until the last heiress Jane Seys married Robert Jones of Fonmon who sold it to owners who let it fall into ruin. Its last occupants were mentioned in the census of 1861.

==== Dimlands ====

Dimlands (or Dimland Castle or Dimland Lodge) () is situated about a kilometre back from the clifftops of the Bristol Channel along the road to St. Donats. It was owned at one time by John Whitlock Nicholl Carne of the University of Oxford who moved there after his father&#x27;s death. Dimlands was built by John Carne&#x27;s father, Rev. Robert Carne, at the end of the 18th century, upon land left him by his father, Whitlock Nicholl of The Ham, sheriff for the county of Glamorgan in 1746. The property was held by the Nicholl family since the time of King Henry VII. The dwelling is of castellated Tudor architecture with blue limestone exterior, and Coombedown stone windows and cornices. The south-facing front is more than in length. The western coast of Cornwall and Lundy Island are visible from the turrets. The carved chimney in the dining room is made of Caen stone, and the chimney-piece in the drawing room is also. Other features are the Minton tile flooring, the large Tudor-style staircase, two sitting rooms, and the library, a newer addition. The Dimlands stables feature sharp-pointed gables, as well as a carved stone with the date of the original grant (1336).

===Hillhead===
On the hillside of the Colhugh Valley there are a row of houses situated at Hillhead in Llantwit Major. The houses were built in the early years of the 19th century for the poor of the parish. With the introduction of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, a workhouse was opened in Bridgend. The houses became surplus to requirements and were then sold as private residences. Llantwit Major came under the Bridgend and Cowbridge Poor Law Union. Each unit was originally divided into two separate upper and lower accommodation, the upstairs entrance was from the west and the entrance to the lower accommodation came from the east.

==Education and sport==
The town is home to Llantwit Major F.C., a football club playing in the Cymru South. The club has enjoyed excellent success in recent years, winning Division Three in 2016/17, and Division Two in 2017/18. Manager Karl Lewis has built a successful squad of players, including Sam Snaith and Adam Roscrow who have gone on to play in the Welsh Premier League and English Football League respectively.

Llanilltud Fawr Comprehensive School is the secondary school in the town. A fire gutted the building in October 1991 and a new building was constructed. The school has roughly 1300 pupils and around 85 full-time staff. Immediately adjacent is Llanilltud Fawr primary school, one of four primary schools in Llantwit, the others being Eagleswell primary school, Ysgol Dewi Sant and St. Illtyd&#x27;s primary school.
Facilities at the Llantwit Major leisure centre include a small swimming pool, large and small sports halls, the LifeStyle Fitness Studio, sunbed facilities, conference room and bar. The Llantwit Major Rugby Football Club, which played its first match against Cowbridge Rugby Football Club in 1889, fields two senior, one youth (U/19) and eight mini/junior teams, and plays in Division Four of the Welsh Rugby Union leagues. Other sports clubs represent association football, cricket and running.

==Cultural references==
The town is fictionally portrayed in the late Glyn Daniel&#x27;s novel &quot;Welcome Death&quot; (1954). Some areas of the town have been used in the recording of the recent series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; episode &quot;The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith&quot; (created by BBC Wales). The local tearooms were used in the 2007 making of &quot;Y Pris&quot; filmed by and shown on S4C.

<doc id="634919" wikidata="Q454553" url="?curid=634919" title="Odo of Cluny">
<text>Odo of Cluny (French: &quot;Odon&quot;) ( 878 – 18 November 942) was the second abbot of Cluny. 

Born to a noble family, he served as a page at the court of Aquitaine. He became a canon of the Church of St. Martin in Tours, and continued his education in Paris under Remigius of Auxerre. Upon returning to Tours, Odo became disillusioned with the life of a canon and subsequently entered the Benedictine abbey at Baume, where he became superior of the abbey school.

Odo joined Abbot Berno at Cluny and when Berno died in 927, was elected his successor. While abbot, he also managed the priory at Romainmôtier. Next, he undertook the reform of Fleury Abbey. He encouraged the monks to adhere more closely to the original &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot;. In 931 the Pope authorized Odo to continue his work in the monasteries of Aquitaine. He enacted the various Cluniac Reforms of France and Italy. In 937, he went to Rome and was given Saint Paul Outside the Walls. He also sent his aides to Monte Cassino and Subiaco.

Odo initiated the practice among the monasteries following Cluny to hold an annual commemoration of all the faithful departed on the day after All Saints&#x27; Day.

He is venerated as a saint by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. His feast day is 18 November.

There is only one contemporary biography of him, the &quot;Vita Odonis&quot; written by John of Salerno.

==Early life==
Odo was born in about 878, the son of Abbo, feudal lord of Deols, near Le Mans and his wife Arenberga. According to the &quot;Vita&quot; later written by Odo&#x27;s disciple John, the couple had long been childless, and one Christmas Eve, Abbo prayed to Our Lady to obtain for him the gift of a son. When the child was born, his grateful father entrusted the boy to the Church of St. Martin in Tours. Both his parents later joined monasteries. His brother Bernard also became a monk.

While yet a child, Odo was sent first to the court of Fulk the Good, Count of Anjou; later he became a page at the court of William the Pious, duke of Aquitaine, where he spent several years. Odo developed a particular devotion to Mary, under the title “Mother of Mercy&quot;, an invocation by which he would address her throughout his life.

==Church of St Martin, Tours==
In the 9th and 10th centuries, the tomb of St Martin of Tours was considered one of the holiest sites in western Christendom. At age 19 Odo was tonsured as a canon of the Church of St. Martin in Tours, where he spent six years studying classic authors, the Fathers of the Church, poetry, and music. Odo would later say that the monks of the monastery of St. Martin of Tours had been spoiled by all the wealth and gifts brought by the pilgrims, and had abandoned the Rule they were required to follow. He would later tell his monks that the religious at Tours no longer attended nightly Lauds for fear of getting their fine shoes dirty. Odo&#x27;s experience at Tours later led him to embrace the monastic reform movement.

In 901 he traveled to Paris where he spent four years completing a course of theological studies, including the study of philosophy under Remigius of Auxerre. Upon his return to Tours, Odo adopted a disciplined and ascetic lifestyle. One day, in reading the rule of Saint Benedict, he was confounded to see how much his life fell short of the maxims there laid down, and he determined to embrace a monastic state. The count of Anjou, his patron, refused to consent, and Odo spent almost three years in a cell, with one companion, in the practice of penance and contemplation. At length, he resolved that no impediments should any longer hinder him from consecrating himself to God in the monastic state. He resigned his canonry, and secretly repaired to the monastery of Beaume, in the diocess of Besançon, where the Abbot Berno admitted him to the habit. He brought with him only his books, which consisted of about a hundred volumes.

==The Monastery at Baume==
Around 909 Odo entered Baume, which was under the direction of Abbot Berno. Berno had joined the Benedictine Order at the Abbey of St. Martin in Autun, where Hugh of Anzy le Duc had introduced stricter adherence to the Rule of Saint Benedict. Later, Berno was sent to the diocese of Besançon to restore the monastery at Baume-les-Messieurs, which had fallen into neglect.

Bishop Turpio of Limoges ordained Odo to the priesthood, which Odo was obliged to accept under obedience. However, Odo was so depressed by this, that Berno sent Odo back to the bishop to visit him. Odo and the bishop talked about the evil condition of the church and all the abuses that were occurring, Odo spoke about the book of Jeremiah, and the bishop was so impressed with his words, that he asked Odo to write it down. Odo said he could not do so without first getting permission from Berno, and the bishop then got Berno&#x27;s permission, and Odo then wrote down his second book the &quot;Collationes&quot;.

Odo became superior of the abbey school at Baume.

==Cluny==
In 910 Abbot Berno left Baume to found Cluny Abbey, taking some of the monks with him. It is not clear at what point exactly Odo left Baume for Cluny. Berno had control of six monasteries when he died in 927, three of which he gave to Wido and the other three he gave to Odo. The monks of Cluny elected Odo as abbot, but he refused on grounds of unworthiness. The bishop threatened Odo with excommunication if he continued to refuse, and thus Odo accepted the office.

At Berno&#x27;s death in 927 (Odo would have been almost 50), Odo became abbot of three monasteries: Deols, Massay and Cluny. Baume became the possession of Wido, who had been the leader of the monks that persecuted Odo when he was with them at Baume. Immediately following Berno&#x27;s death, Wido attempted to gain control of Cluny by force, but Pope John X sent a letter to Rudolf, King of the Franks to intervene. Cluny was still not finished construction when Odo became abbot, and he continued construction efforts but he ran into financial difficulties. Odo had a strong devotion to St Martin of Tours for most of his life. He continued to pray to St Martin for all of his and the monastery&#x27;s problems. One story recounts the one year, on the feast day of Martin of Tours, Odo saw an old man looking over the unfinished building. The old man then went to Odo and said that he was St Martin and that if the monks continued to persevere that he would arrange it for the money they needed to come to them. A few days later, 3000 solidi of gold was brought as a gift to Cluny.

Odo continued to uphold the Benedictine Rule at Cluny just as Berno had done. Throughout Odo&#x27;s rule of Cluny, the monastery continually enjoy protection from both Popes and temporal rulers, who guaranteed the monastery&#x27;s independence. Many times during Odo&#x27;s reign, Cluny&#x27;s property was extended as gifts of land were added to it. During his tenure as abbot, the monastic church of SS. Peter and Paul was completed.

Odo taught the monks that the blind and the lame were the porters of the gates of paradise. If a monk was ever rude or harsh to a beggar who came to the monastery gates, Odo would call the beggar back and tell him, &#x27;When he who has served thee thus, comes himself seeking entrance from thee at the gates of paradise, repay him in like manner.&#x27; The charity of Cluny was well-known. In one year food was distributed to more than seven thousand persons in need.

== Reforms of other monasteries ==
After Berno&#x27;s death, the first monasteries that Odo reformed were at Romainmoutier, St. Michael&#x27;s Abbey at Tulle, and the Abbey of Saint-Géraud at Aurillac. He encouraged them to return to the original pattern of the Benedictine rule of prayer, manual labor, and community life under the direction of a spiritual father. It was his usual saying, that no one can be called a monk who is not a true lover, and strict observer of silence, a condition absolutely necessary for interior solitude and the commerce of a soul with God.

Odo would later relate a tale to his monks regarding two monks from Tours who chose not to wear their habits. On one occasion they were once sent out on business. One wore his habit, the other dressed like a layperson. The monk dressed as a layperson became mortally ill, and the other monk had a vision in which he saw St Benedict sitting on a throne in heaven surrounded by an army of monks. The dying monk was lying prostrate and asking for help. Benedict said that he did not recognize this monk&#x27;s habit and that he must belong to a different order. Benedict then said he could do nothing as he had no jurisdiction over those of another order. The dying monk despaired, but his companion torn off his habit and wrapped it around the dying monk, and Benedict then healed the dying monk of his sickness.

In 930, he reformed Fleury Abbey. At that time Fleury held the bones of St Benedict, brought there from Monte Cassino. However, by the time of Odo, it had lost its reputation for holiness and was filled with many of the same abuses that were occurring in other places. The Viking raids had caused monks at Fleury, as in many places, to return to their villages for safety, but when they returned to the monastery again, they did not return to their old discipline and abused the Rule. Odo went to Fleury on the request of King Rudolf of the Franks. Upon arriving he found the monks armed with spears and swords and threatening to murder him. After a standoff for three days, Odo rode towards the monastery on his donkey and the monks put down their weapons.

Odo then took over leadership of it on a temporary basis and reformed it. He encountered resistance in trying to get the monks to abide by the rule against eating flesh meat. The monks would patiently wait for the supply of fish to run out in the hope that he would be forced to give them meat to eat. However, Odo consistently was always able to find a source for fish. A story from this time held that one day when Odo was present at Fleury for Benedict&#x27;s feast day, Benedict appeared to a brother who had fallen asleep. Benedict told the monk that since Fleury was founded, no monk of Fleury had inherited eternal life. Benedict then asked the monk if they had enough fish, and the monk said they did not, and Benedict told him that they should fish in the marsh and not in the river. The monks then went to the marsh to fish and caught a huge catch of fish.

Authorized by a privilege of Pope John XI in 931, Odo reformed the monasteries in Aquitaine, northern France, and Italy. The privilege empowered him to unite several abbeys under his supervision and to receive at Cluny monks from abbeys not yet reformed; the greater number of the reformed monasteries, however, remained independent, and several became centres of reform. 
Cluny became the model of monasticism for over a century and transformed the role of piety in European daily life. The monastery claimed its heritage traced, through Berno and Hugh of Anzy le Duc, all the way back to St Benedict of Nursia.

In later years he also reformed many other monasteries including St Martial&#x27;s and St Augustine&#x27;s monasteries in Limoges, St Jean-d&#x27;Angely in Aquitaine, Jumièges Abbey in Normandy, St Peter Le Vif in Sens, and St Julian&#x27;s in Tours. These monasteries, however, would go on to also reform and found other monasteries. The Cluniac observance, as established by Odo, became the model of monasticism for over a century.

==In Italy==
Many monasteries in Italy were deserted, because of continual attacks by Huns and Muslims who would often deliberately seek out monasteries to plunder. The lands of monasteries were often seized by local nobles. Between 936 and 942 he visited Italy several times.

Odo first came to Rome in the year 936 and took the opportunity to use Alberic II of Spoleto&#x27;s support to reform and revive monastic life in central Italy. Several Roman monasteries were rebuilt. Odo restored St Paul&#x27;s Outside the Walls, which became Odo&#x27;s headquarters in Rome. The palace on the Aventine where Alberic was born was transformed into Our Lady on the Aventine. The monasteries of St Lawrence and St Agnes, were restored and reformed. The monks of St Andre&#x27;s on the Clivus Scaurus resisted a return to the Benedictine Rule, and so they were expelled and new monks were put in their place. The monastery at Farla, where the monks had completely abandoned the Rule and murdered their own abbot, was also brought under control.

Odo sent his disciple Baldwin to Monte Cassino to restore it, because it had also been left to lie waste; the nearby Subiaco Abbey also received his influence. Odo became involved in reforms as far as Naples, Salerno and Benevento. In the North, St Peter&#x27;s, Ciel d&#x27;Oro in Pavia was also brought under the control of one of Odo&#x27;s disciples. St Elias&#x27; monastery in Nepi was put under the control of one of Odo&#x27;s disciples. These monks resisted the rule against flesh meat and Odo&#x27;s disciple struggled to keep up a constant supply of fish for them to eat. When Odo visited the monastery, a stream miraculously flowed from a nearby mountain and fish were in the stream.

Alberic fought a war with his stepfather Hugh of Lombardy and Odo was twice called in to act as a mediator between them.

A story holds that one time Odo was crossing the Alps in deep snow and his horse lost footing, causing both him and his horse to fall over a cliff, but he caught a tree and held to its branches until help could come.

Another story held that one time forty robbers attempted to attack him on the road, but he continued forward singing psalms as usual. One of the robbers then said, &#x27;Let us leave them alone for I never remember having seen such men before. We might overcome the company, but never their armour-bearer, that strenuous man. If we attack them it will be the worse for us.&#x27; The other robbers insisted that they would succeed, and then the first robber said, &#x27;Then turn your arms against me, for as long as I am alive, no harm shall come to them.&#x27; The robbers then debated among themselves about what to do, and Odo continued on unmolested. The first robber who spoke later became a disciple of Odo.

==Death of Odo==
In 942, peace was in Rome once again between Alberic and his stepfather. He fell ill, and sensing his approaching death, decided to return to Gaul. He stopped at the monastery of St. Julian in Tours for the celebration of the feast day of St. Martin. He developed a fever and after a lingering sickness died on 18 November. During his last illness, he composed a hymn in honor of Martin. He was buried in the church of Saint Julian; but the Huguenots burnt the majority of his remains. His feast day is 18 November; the Benedictines observe 11 May.

Pope Benedict XVI notes that Odo&#x27;s austerity as a rigorous reformer tends to obscure a less-obvious trait: a deep, heartfelt kindness. &quot;He was austere, but above all he was good...&quot; His biographer, John of Salerno, records that Odo was in the habit of asking the children he met along the way to sing, and that he would then give them some small token. &quot;[T]he energetic yet at the same time lovable medieval abbot, enthusiastic about reform, with incisive action nourished in his monks, as well as in the lay faithful of his time...&quot;

==Writings==
Among his writings are: a commentary on the &quot;Moralia&quot; of Pope Gregory I, a biography of Saint Gerald of Aurillac, three books of &quot;Collationes&quot; (moral essays, severe and forceful), a few sermons, an epic poem on the Redemption (&quot;Occupatio&quot;) in several books, three hymns (&quot;Rex Christe Martini decus&quot;, &quot;Martine par apostolis&quot; and &quot;Martine iam consul poliand&quot;), and twelve choral antiphons in honour of Saint Martin of Tours. Some scholars have attributed the &quot;Musica enchiriadis&quot; to him.

A story holds that one time Odo was writing a glossary to the life of St Martin written by Postumianus and Gallus. The book, however, was left in a cellar which was flooded with water during a rainstorm at night. The place where the book lay was covered by a torrent, but the next day when the monks came down to the cellar they found that only the margin of the book was soaked through but all of the writing was untouched. Odo then told the monks, &#x27;Why do ye marvel oh brothers? Know ye not that the water feared to touch the life of the saint?&#x27; Then a monk replied, &#x27;But see, the book is old and moth-eaten, and has so often been soaked that it is dirty and faint! Can our father then persuade us that the rain feared to touch a book which in the past has been soaked through? Nay, there is another reason.&#x27; Odo then realized that they were suggesting it was preserved because he had written a glossary in it, but he then quickly gave the glory to God and St Martin.

==Veneration==
Odo is commemorated in Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church:
* 18 November - main commemoration,
* 29 April or 11 May - commemoration of four abbots of Cluny (Odo, Maiolus, Odilo(n), Hugh).

<text>The Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola at Campus Martius (, ) is a Latin Catholic titular church, of deaconry rank, dedicated to Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus, located in Rome, Italy. Built in Baroque style between 1626 and 1650, the church functioned originally as the chapel of the adjacent Roman College, which moved in 1584 to a new larger building and was renamed the Pontifical Gregorian University. It is one of the great 17th century preaching churches built by Counter-Reformation orders in the Centro Storico (the others being The Gesù, also of the Jesuits, San Carlo ai Catinari of the Barnabites, Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle of the Theatines, and the Chiesa Nuova of the Oratorians).

==History==
The opened very humbly in 1551, with an inscription over the door summing up its simple purpose: &quot;School of Grammar, Humanity, and Christian Doctrine. Free&quot;. Plagued by financial problems in the early years, the had various provisional centres. In 1560, Vittoria della Tolfa, della Valle, donated her family &quot;isola&quot;, an entire city block and its existing buildings, to the Society of Jesus in memory of her late husband the Marchese della Guardia Camillo Orsini, founding the . She had previously intended to donate it to the Poor Clares for the founding of a monastery. The nuns had already started to build what had been intended to become the Church of Santa Maria della Nunziata, erected on the spot where the Temple of Isis had stood.

Although the Jesuits got the marchesa&#x27;s land, they did not get any money from her for completing the church. Budgetary constraints compelled them to hire their own architect. Construction of the church was taken over by the Jesuit architect Giovanni Tristano. Built entirely by Jesuit labour, the Church of the Annunciation was first used for worship in 1567. A three-aisled church dedicated to the Most Holy Annunciation () was built by the Collegio Romano between 1562 and 1567 on the foundations of the pre-existing construction. Since the earlier church had already been built to the height of the ground floor in 1555, there was no way for the Jesuits to expand the structure to hold the increasing number of students attending the Collegio Romano. The facade was very similar to that of the contemporary Church of Sant&#x27;Andrea al Quirinale, which was also designed by Giovanni Tristano. In accordance with the wishes of the marchesa, the façade proudly displayed the Orsini arms. The Church of the Annunciation was enlarged in 1580 when Pope Gregory XIII expanded the Collegio Romano itself, especially the side chapels.

The old church became insufficient for over 2,000 students of many nations who were attending the College at the beginning of the 17th century. Pope Gregory XV, who was an old pupil of the , was strongly attached to the church. Following the canonization of Ignatius of Loyola in 1622, he suggested to his nephew, Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi, that a new church dedicated to the founder of the Jesuits should be erected at the college itself. The young cardinal accepted the idea, asked several architects to draw plans, among them Carlo Maderno. Ludovisi finally chose the plans drawn up by the Jesuit mathematician, Orazio Grassi, professor at the Collegio Romano itself.

The foundation stone was laid only on 2 August 1626, four years later, a delay which was caused by the fact that a section of the buildings belonging to the Roman College had to be dismantled. The old church was eventually demolished in 1650 to make way for the massive Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola, which was begun in 1626 and finished only at the end of the century. In striking contrast to the Church of the Annunciation, which occupied only a small section of the Collegio Romano, the Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola took up a quarter of the entire block when it was completed.

The church was opened for public worship only in 1650, at the occasion of the Jubilee of 1650. The final solemn consecration of the church was celebrated only in 1722 by Cardinal Antonfelice Zondadari. The church&#x27;s entrance now faces on to the Rococo Place of San Ignazio was planned by the architect Filippo Raguzzini.

==Interior==
The church has a Latin cross plan with numerous side chapels. The building was inspired by the Jesuit mother church, the Church of the Gesù in Rome (finished in the late 16th century). The imposing order of Corinthian pilasters that rings the entire interior, the theatrical focus on the high altar at the rear of the broad eastern apse, the church&#x27;s colored marbles, animated stucco figural relief, richly ornamented altars, extensive gilding, and bold &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; paintings in the &quot;dome&quot; at its crossing and in the nave ceiling all produce a festive, sumptuous effect. Funds to build a dome were lacking, hence a painter to paint the illusion of a dome was hired.

The nave&#x27;s west wall has a sculptural group depicting &quot;Magnificence and Religion&quot; (1650) by Alessandro Algardi. Algardi also helped design the high reliefs in stucco that run on both lateral nave walls just above the entries to the chapels and beneath the nave&#x27;s grandiose entablature.

Other artworks in the church include a huge stucco statue of St. Ignatius by Camillo Rusconi (1728). Saints Aloysius Gonzaga, Robert Bellarmine, and John Berchmans are buried in the church. The church is also the resting place of Bartol Kašić.

===Frescoes of Andrea Pozzo===

Andrea Pozzo, a Jesuit lay brother, painted the grandiose fresco that stretches across the ceiling of the nave around 1685. It celebrates the work of Saint Ignatius and the Society of Jesus in the world presenting the saint welcomed into paradise by Christ and the Virgin Mary and surrounded by allegorical representations of all four continents.
By the skilful use of linear perspective, light, and shade, he made the great barrel-vault of the nave of the church into an idealized aula from which is seen the reception of St. Ignatius into the opened heavens. Pozzo worked to open up, even dissolve the actual surface of the nave&#x27;s barrel vault to make the observer see a huge and lofty cupola (of a sort), open to the bright sky, and filled with upward floating figures. A marble disk set into the middle of the nave floor marks the ideal spot from which observers might fully experience the illusion. 

A second marker in the nave floor further east provides the ideal vantage point for the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painting on canvas that covers the crossing and depicts a tall, ribbed and coffered dome. The cupola one expects to see here was never built and in its place, in 1685, Andrea Pozzo supplied a painting on canvas with a projection of a cupola. The original painting, completed in 1685, was destroyed by fire; in 1823 it was faithfully reproduced by Francesco Manno on the basis of drawings and studies left by the Pozzo.
Pozzo also frescoed the pendentives in the crossing with Old Testament figures: Judith, David, Samson, and Jaele.

Pozzo also painted the frescoes in the eastern apse depicting the life and apotheosis of St Ignatius. The &quot;Siege of Pamplona&quot; in the tall panel on the left commemorates the wounding of Ignatius, which led to the convalescence that transformed his life. The panel over the high altar, &quot;Vision of St Ignatius at the Chapel of La Storta&quot;, commemorates the vision that gave the saint his divine calling. &quot;St Ignatius sends St Francis Xavier to India&quot; recalls the aggressive Jesuit missionary work in foreign countries, and finally, &quot;St Ignatius Receiving Francesco Borgia&quot; recalls the recruitment of the Spanish noble who would become General of the Company of Jesuits. Pozzo is also responsible for the fresco in the conch depicting &quot;St. Ignatius Healing the Pestilent.&quot;

===Chapels===

The first chapel on the right has an 18th-century altarpiece showing &quot;Saints Stanislaus Kostka and John Francis Regis Worshiping the Virgin and Child&quot;. The second chapel has an altarpiece depicting &quot;St Joseph and Virgin&quot; and a lunette (right wall) depicting the &quot;Last Communion of St Luigi Gonzaga&quot;, both by Francesco Trevisani (1656–1746); the cupola was painted by Luigi Garzi. The third chapel has an 18th-century altarpiece of &quot;Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple&quot; by Stefano Pozzi.

The chapel in the right transept, dedicated to St. Aloysius Gonzaga, has a large marble high-relief depicting &quot;St. Aloysius Gonzaga in Glory&quot; (1697–99) by the French sculptor Pierre Le Gros. Andrea Pozzo painted the ceiling which also shows the &quot;Glory of the Saint&quot;. Buried in the side altar next to Gonzaga is Cardinal St. Robert Bellarmine.

The chapel in the left transept houses the relics of St. John Berchmans.

The chapel just to the right of the church&#x27;s presbytery (at the south-east corner) houses the funerary monuments of Pope Gregory XV and his nephew, Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi, the church&#x27;s founder. Pierre Le Gros designed the monument and executed most of it himself c. 1709–14 with the exception of the two flying personifications of Fame which are by Pierre-Étienne Monnot.

The chapel in the left transept has a marble altarpiece of the &quot;Annunciation&quot; by Filippo Della Valle, with allegorical figures and angels (1649) by Pietro Bracci, and a frescoed ceiling with &quot;The Assumption&quot; by Pozzo. The second and first chapels to the left have paintings by Jesuit Pierre de Lattre, who also did the sacristy paintings.

<text>The Spruce Hole Bog, locally known as Spruce Hole, is a complete ecological community occupying a true kettle hole in the town of Durham, New Hampshire. According to the National Register of Natural Landmarks: &quot;It illustrates characteristics of a typical sphagnum-heath bog, localized in a specialized geologic setting.&quot; It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1972. Spruce Hole is located west of the town center of Durham and is owned by the town, which has conserved around it. It is reached by a woods road off Packer&#x27;s Falls Road, and despite the name, the surrounding forest is mostly white pine, hemlock, and birch.

The bog is also adjacent to the Oyster River Forest, a permanently conserved + parcel owned by the town of Durham.

<doc id="634922" wikidata="Q531718" url="?curid=634922" title="Efrem Zimbalist Jr.">
<text>Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (November 30, 1918 – May 2, 2014) was an American actor best known for his starring roles in the television series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; and &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; He is also known as recurring character &quot;Dandy Jim Buckley&quot; in the series &quot;Maverick&quot; and as the voice of Alfred Pennyworth in the DC Animated Universe.

==Early life==
Zimbalist was born in 1918 in Brooklyn to Jewish immigrants Efrem Zimbalist (1889–1985), a famous Russian-born violinist and symphony conductor, and Alma Gluck (1884–1938), an equally famous Romanian-born operatic soprano. He had an older sister, Mary (1915–2008), along with a half-sister from his mother&#x27;s first marriage, author Marcia Davenport (1903–1996). His stepmother was Mary Louise Curtis Bok Zimbalist, the founder of the Curtis Institute of Music. Both parents converted to Anglican Christianity and regularly attended the Episcopal Church. Efrem Jr. attended Fay School in Southborough, Massachusetts.

Zimbalist boarded at St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire, taking part in school plays. He briefly attended Yale University but was expelled, reinstated and expelled a second time on account of low grades. He moved back to New York City in 1936 to work as a page for NBC radio where he had small on-air roles as well as presenting shows. He furthered his acting training at Neighborhood Playhouse before serving in the United States Army during World War II, where he became friends with writer and director Garson Kanin.

==Military service==
Zimbalist was drafted in 1941. Inducted into the United States Army, he completed his initial training at Fort Dix, New Jersey. Selected for officer candidate school, after graduation in 1943 he received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry. Zimbalist was assigned as a platoon leader in Company L, 3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division and participated in combat in Europe following the Normandy landings. He was discharged at the end of the war, and his awards and decorations included the Bronze Star Medal and Combat Infantryman Badge, in addition to the Purple Heart he received for a shrapnel wound to his leg during the battle of Hürtgen Forest.

==Career==

===Early career===
Following the war, Zimbalist returned to New York and made his Broadway acting debut in &quot;The Rugged Path&quot;, starring Spencer Tracy. This led to a stage career as both actor and producer. His producing successes included bringing three Gian Carlo Menotti operas to Broadway, one of which, &quot;The Consul&quot;, won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1950.

In 1954–1955, he co-starred in his first television series, &quot;Concerning Miss Marlowe&quot;.

===Warner Bros. star===
In 1956, Zimbalist was put under contract by Warner Bros. and moved to Hollywood.
Zimbalist&#x27;s first recurring role in a Warner Bros. Television series was as roguish gambler &quot;Dandy Jim Buckley&quot; on &quot;Maverick&quot;, opposite James Garner in 1957, and making five appearances as the character. In 1958, Zimbalist played the co-lead Stuart &quot;Stu&quot; Bailey in &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, a popular detective series running until 1964.

During this period, he made several concurrent appearances in other Warner Bros. television shows, such as &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, &quot;The Alaskans&quot;, and &quot;Bronco&quot;. He also starred as the lead in several feature films for Warners, such as &quot;Bombers B-52&quot;, &quot;The Deep Six&quot;, &quot;A Fever in the Blood&quot; and &quot;The Chapman Report&quot;. Zimbalist was in such demand during this time that he was given a vacation by Jack L. Warner, owing to exhaustion from his busy schedule.

Jack Warner lent him to Columbia Pictures for &quot;By Love Possessed&quot; in exchange for adding several years to his Warners&#x27; contract, but he refused to let Zimbalist appear in &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

In 1959, he was awarded the Golden Globe for &quot;Most Promising Newcomer – Male&quot;.

=== &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; television series ===

Apart from &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, Zimbalist was most widely known for his starring role as Inspector Lewis Erskine in the Quinn Martin television production &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, which premiered on September 19, 1965, and aired its final episode on April 28, 1974. Zimbalist was generous in his praise of producer Martin and of his own experience starring in the show. Those who worked with him were equally admiring of the star&#x27;s professionalism and likable personality.

Zimbalist maintained a strong personal relationship with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who requested that the show be technically accurate and portray his agents in the best possible light, and he insisted actors playing FBI employees undergo a background check. Zimbalist subsequently spent a week in contact with Hoover in Washington, D.C., and at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. The men remained mutual admirers for the rest of Hoover&#x27;s life. Hoover held up Zimbalist as a model for FBI employees&#x27; personal appearance.

The Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation honored the character of Lewis Erskine in 1985 with a set of retired credentials, and on June 8, 2009, FBI Director Robert Mueller presented Zimbalist with a plaque honoring him for his work on the series.

The show was revived in the 1980s as &quot;Today&#x27;s FBI&quot; starring Mike Connors.

===Other television work===

After &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, he appeared in other series, including CBS&#x27;s short-lived &quot;The Reporter&quot; starring Harry Guardino as journalist Danny Taylor of the fictitious &quot;New York Globe&quot;. He also appeared in leading and supporting roles in several feature films, including &quot;Harlow&quot;, &quot;A Fever in the Blood&quot; (a film about a ruthless politician), &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; and &quot;Airport 1975&quot;.

Zimbalist had a recurring role as Daniel Chalmers, a white-collar con man, on his daughter Stephanie Zimbalist&#x27;s 1980s television detective series &quot;Remington Steele&quot;. He also recurred in the television dramatic series &quot;Hotel&quot;.

In 1990, he played the father of Zorro in the Christian Broadcasting Network&#x27;s &quot;The New Zorro&quot;. Zimbalist relinquished the role after the program&#x27;s first season because of the filming at studios outside Madrid, Spain, and the role subsequently went to Henry Darrow. He had a small recurring role in the 1990s hit science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; as William Edgars.

Also in the 1990s, Zimbalist played Alfred Pennyworth in &quot;&quot; as well as in &quot;&quot;, &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot;, and the animated films &quot;&quot;, &quot;Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero&quot;, &quot;&quot;. He said being Alfred had &quot;made me an idol in my little grandchildren’s eyes.” Zimbalist also played villain Doctor Octopus in &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot;. He appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network and as himself in the 1998 Smithsonian Institution production of &quot;Gemstones of America&quot;. He performed as the narrator in &quot;Good Morning, America&quot; by Elinor Remick Warren. 

Zimbalist wrote an autobiography, &quot;My Dinner of Herbs&quot;, published by Limelight Editions, New York.

In 2008, he appeared in the short film &quot;The Delivery&quot;, in which he played a professor who helps a young girl in her struggles for literacy. The film won first place in fantasy at the Dragon*Con Film Festival and was an official selection at the Los Angeles International Children&#x27;s Festival and the Reel Women International Film Festival in 2009.

==Personal life==

In December 1941, Zimbalist married Emily Munroe McNair. They had two children, Efrem &quot;Skip&quot; Zimbalist III (b. 1947) and Nancy (1944–2012). In January 1950, Emily died from cancer.

In 1956, Zimbalist married Loranda Stephanie Spalding. They had a daughter, future actress Stephanie Zimbalist. 

On February 5, 2007, Loranda died from lung cancer, aged 73.

===Religious beliefs===
Zimbalist&#x27;s parents, Alma Gluck and Efrem Zimbalist, were of Jewish descent but, on emigrating to America, had left the religion. Moreover, Efrem Zimbalist stated, &quot;As far as I am concerned, there has been no Jew in the family for sixty-five years.&quot;

Zimbalist was baptized in the Episcopal Church. He said that when growing up he was taken to church every Sunday. He attended St. Paul&#x27;s School, an Episcopal boarding school in New Hampshire. Zimbalist said his faith gave him comfort when Emily died.

He had a nine-year association with the practice of Transcendental Meditation as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Zimbalist described the Maharishi Yogi as a &quot;fascinating character&quot;, but found the meditation method &quot;... was a total waste of energy for me.&quot;

In the late 1970s, he was drawn to the Charismatic Christianity movement. His first association was with Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye Bakker&#x27;s PTL ministry. For several years, he was a member of the PTL board. PTL&#x27;s principal televangelistic successor, the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), engaged Zimbalist to make its many announcements, including the station&#x27;s idents every half hour, which aired between 1992 and 2012. In a five-minute segment called &quot;The Word&quot; aired on TBN at 25 minutes after the hour, Zimbalist would read a verse from the Bible, eventually completing the entire text, verse by verse. In 1989, he said, &quot;for a while I did go overboard in my association with a fundamentalist group&quot;.

In later life, Zimbalist joined the congregation of an Episcopal parish near to his home. Afterward he joined the Anglican Church of Our Savior in Santa Barbara; he was an occasional reader there and requested donations be made to them (among others) in his obituary.

===Political views===
In 1963 and 1964, Zimbalist joined fellow actors William Lundigan, Chill Wills and Walter Brennan in making appearances on behalf of U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate, in his election campaign against U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.

==Death==
Zimbalist died at the age of 95, as his father had, on May 2, 2014, from natural causes.

<text>Baseball America (BA) is a sports publication company that covers baseball at every level, including Major League Baseball (MLB), with a particular focus on up-and-coming players in Minor League Baseball (MiLB) college, high school, and international leagues. It is currently published in the form of an editorial and stats website, a monthly magazine, a podcast network, and three annual reference book titles. It also regularly produces lists of the top prospects in the sport, and covers aspects of the game from a scouting and player development point of view. Industry insiders look to BA for its expertise and insights related to annual and future MLB draft classes. The publication&#x27;s motto is &quot;The most trusted source in baseball.&quot;

==History==
&quot;Baseball America&quot; was founded in 1981 and has since grown into a full-service media company. Founder Allan Simpson began writing the magazine from Canada, originally calling it the &quot;All-America Baseball News&quot;. By 1983, Simpson moved the magazine to Durham, North Carolina, after it was purchased by then-Durham Bulls owner Miles Wolff. Simpson left his position at the magazine in 2006.

Source Interlink (later and the Motor Trend Group) purchased Baseball America in December 2011 and sold the publication in February 2017. The new Baseball America Enterprises includes Gary Green and Larry Botel of Alliance Baseball, owners of minor league franchises in Omaha, Neb., and Richmond, Va., in partnership with David Geaslen, founder and CEO of 3STEP Sports. Today, &quot;Baseball America&quot; is led by president Tom Dondero and Editor in Chief J.J. Cooper. It also uses outsourced correspondents.

==Content==
&quot;Baseball America&quot; is published on the web and monthly in print. Every issue features coverage of the majors, minors, baseball&#x27;s draft, college and high school baseball. Other features include reviews and analysis of prospects as well as tracking the progress of the best players in amateur baseball and the minors.

Other annual publications produced by the company include &quot;Baseball America Almanac&quot;, &quot;Baseball America Prospect Handbook&quot; (a &quot;New York Times&quot; sports best-seller in March 2016), and the &quot;Baseball America Directory&quot;. &quot;Baseball America &quot;also has an active social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, bringing its scouting and player-development point of view to 21st century media platforms.

<text>Catherine Elizabeth Deeley (born 23 October 1976) is an English television presenter. She is currently the main co-presenter for ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot;, alongside Ben Shephard. 

Deeley began her career as a co-presenter of the ITV children&#x27;s show &quot;SMTV Live&quot; (1998–2002), for which she won a BAFTA Children&#x27;s Award, and its spin-off chart show &quot;&quot; (1998–2005). In 2003, she co-presented the talent show &quot;Fame Academy&quot; on BBC One and became the presenter of the ITV talent show &quot;Stars in Their Eyes.&quot; Following the final series of &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot; in 2006, Deeley began hosting the reality competition show &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; in the United States, for which she has been nominated five times for a Primetime Emmy.

Since 2003, Deeley has been a patron of London&#x27;s Great Ormond Street Hospital for sick children. In December 2009, she was made a UNICEF UK ambassador.

==Early life==
Deeley was born on 23 October 1976 at Sandwell General Hospital in West Bromwich, West Midlands. She grew up in Birmingham, in nearby Sutton Coldfield and Great Barr. She attended Grove Vale Junior School and Dartmouth High School in Great Barr, where she played the clarinet in the Sandwell Youth Concert Band. Deeley then attended Bishop Veseys Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield.

==Career==
At the age of 14, Deeley entered a regional edition of a BBC competition for &quot;The Clothes Show&quot;, in which she reached the national finals. She was signed as a model under her nickname of &quot;Cat&quot; to make it easier for clients to re-book her. She left full-time fashion modelling in 1997, following changes in her contract with Storm. Deeley moved on to co-present the MTV chart show, &quot;Hitlist UK&quot;, with close friend Edith Bowman. From 1998 until 2002, Deeley was co-host of the Saturday morning children&#x27;s programme &quot;SM:TV Live&quot;, and hosted its spin-off programmes &quot;&quot; (1998–2005) and &quot;CD:UK Hotshots&quot;. On &quot;SM:TV Live&quot;, she often acted as an apparently slightly unwilling assistant whenever the show featured a guest appearance by a magician, participating in a number of different illusions, including being sawn in half in a version of the illusion called Clearly Impossible.

In 2001, Deeley won a Children&#x27;s BAFTA award and appeared in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Happiness&quot;. In 2002, she appeared in a television advert for Marks and Spencer. Other programmes she hosted include &quot;The Record of the Year&quot;, &quot;Fame Academy&quot;, &quot;The 2004 Brit Awards&quot; and &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;, as well as a weekly broadcast on London&#x27;s Capital FM and a BBC Choice series, &quot;Roadtripping&quot;, both with former MTV colleague Edith Bowman. In March 2003, it was announced that Deeley would take over from Matthew Kelly as host of the kids series of &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;. Following Kelly&#x27;s departure from the main series in March 2004, Deeley became host of the main show until its demise in December 2006.

In 2003, Deeley interviewed Kylie Minogue for a television special about her one-off concert, &quot;Money Can&#x27;t Buy&quot;, which was broadcast in the United Kingdom on ITV on 22 November and in Australia on Network Ten on 24 November. In 2005, Deeley played herself in an episode of &quot;Little Britain&quot;, provided the voice of Loretta Geargrinder in the UK version of the film &quot;Robots&quot;, replacing Natasha Lyonne, and presented a countdown of ITV&#x27;s 50 Greatest Shows alongside Phillip Schofield as part of ITV 50.

In 2006, Deeley began hosting the second season of American reality show &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, replacing newsreader Lauren Sánchez, who was pregnant. Deeley again interviewed Kylie Minogue for another television special, which was broadcast in the United Kingdom on Sky One on 16 July, in Australia on Channel Nine on 17 July and BBC America on 9 September. Deeley was a guest reporter on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. She presented Fox&#x27;s &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve Special&quot; from Times Square in 2006 and 2007.
On 1 July 2007, Deeley was one of many presenters at the Concert for Diana, a tribute concert to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, with proceeds from the concert going to Diana&#x27;s charities, as well as to charities of which her sons Princes William and Harry are patrons. The event, watched by an estimated 500 million people, was held at Wembley Stadium. In September 2007, Deeley presented &quot;Soundtrack to My Life&quot;, a music series produced by Hamma &amp; Glamma Productions for ITV London that looked at the work and influences of an eclectic band of musicians. In January 2006, a new season of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; started its auditions, with Deeley in the role of host. She has been the host of the show ever since. In 2011, Deeley was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Programme.

Other projects of Deeley&#x27;s include presenting the third season of &quot;Soundtrack to My Life&quot; and playing herself as host of comedian Peter Kay&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got the Pop Factor&quot;. In February 2009, Deeley guest hosted the United States syndicated version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; (as an alternate host for Meredith Vieira) and appeared on BBC America&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s F Word&quot;. In the same year, Deeley hosted the television version of the electronic game &quot;20Q&quot; for GSN. In January and February 2010, Deeley hosted &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; in the UK. February 2010 also saw her filling in for a holidaying Vieira as host on the morning TV show &quot;Today&quot;. On 31 March 2010, Deeley stood in for Kelly Ripa on the morning talk show &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;.

On 9 January 2011, Deeley made a small guest appearance in the Disney Channel sitcom &quot;Shake It Up&quot;, in which she portrayed a vice principal who is, in secret, a dancer and a host.

In April 2011, Deeley presented an episode of CNN&#x27;s &quot;Icon&quot; and spoke to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; voice actress Nancy Cartwright. In the same month, Deeley also contributed to the network&#x27;s coverage of that year&#x27;s Royal Wedding, which was hosted by tabloid journalist Piers Morgan.

In June 2011, Deeley launched her own &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; web series called &quot;In the Dressing Room with Cat Deeley&quot;, produced by Deeley, Yahoo! and Collective Digital Studio.

On 18 August 2011, she appeared on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, as a fill-in for Kelly.

On 26 January 2012, Deeley again co-hosted &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; with Kelly Ripa. On 14 March 2012, Deeley appeared as a guest judge on &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; Cycle 18.

She hosted Fox&#x27;s celebrity dating game show &quot;The Choice&quot;, which premiered on 7 June 2012 and ended on 12 July 2012 in the United States.

In 2011, Deeley presented the series &quot;Royally Mad&quot; for BBC America, and in 2012, she presented the launch show for ITV&#x27;s Soccer Aid appeal on the Friday before the Soccer Aid match. In June 2014, she once again presented the launch show for Soccer Aid that year.

From 2014 until 2016, Deeley appeared as a panelist on the syndicated game show &quot;Celebrity Name Game&quot;, hosted by Craig Ferguson.

In 2017, Deeley played Maskface in &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; miniseries &quot;The Missing Crown Jewels&quot;.

On 31 May 2017, Deeley presented the game show &quot;Big Star Little Star&quot;, based on the British game show &quot;Big Star&#x27;s Little Star&quot;, for the USA Network in the United States.

In October 2017, Deeley began presenting the talent contest &quot;&quot; for Sky One in the United Kingdom.

In 2018, Deeley appeared on &quot;The Final Table&quot; Season 1 Episode 3, as a guest judge.

Deeley took part in a reunion show for &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, in which Deeley and Ant and Dec went back to where the original show was filmed, and producers rebuilt the old set. It aired on 26 December 2020 as &quot;The Story of SM:TV Live&quot;.

In January 2021, Deeley made her BBC Radio 2 debut sitting in on &quot;The Saturday Show.&quot; She has regularly provided cover, sitting in for presenters including Steve Wright and Rylan Clark.

She reunited with her &quot;Chums&quot; cast mates Ant and Dec for a television special on the fifth episode of series seventeen of &quot;Ant and Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; on 20 March 2021, which reenacts and picks up the cliffhanger from the wedding episode 20 years ago.

In April 2021, Deeley presented &quot;Lorraine&quot; as a guest host over the Easter holidays, joining again for the May spring bank holiday broadcast.

Deeley&#x27;s first book, a picture book for children titled &quot;The Joy in You&quot;, was published by Random House on 15 September 2020. It was co-written with Laura Baker and illustrated by Rosie Butcher. A Kirkus review of the book concluded &quot;The message is wholehearted and positive, but the cloying execution doesn&#x27;t stand out.&quot;

As an actress, Deeley appeared as herself in the sixth episode of &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot;. She also appeared in the second episode of &quot;House of Lies&quot; as herself in January 2012. Her breakthrough as a lead actress came in the 2015 Hulu TV series &quot;Deadbeat&quot;, playing a celebrity medium named Camomile White. Deeley voiced a version of herself in a 2015 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; entitled &quot;Waiting for Duffman&quot;.

In 2023, she was a guest presenter for ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot;, following Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby&#x27;s departures from the show. Deeley was tipped to host the programme full-time, but initial reports suggested that she had declined the offer. On 16 February 2024, it was announced that Deeley would present the show on a permanent basis, alongside Ben Shephard.

In June 2024, Deeley came under fire from the Epilepsy Society and viewers of &quot;This Morning&quot; for making a joke about having a seizure on the show. After Shepherd asked her if she was alright while she was dancing, she stated she was &quot;having a seizure&quot;. Deeley apologised the next day, and said &quot;It really wasn&#x27;t supposed to cause any upset to anybody&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
Since 2003, Deeley has been a patron of London&#x27;s Great Ormond Street Hospital. She is also an active supporter of UNICEF. In 2007, she took part in a UNICEF benefit show in Los Angeles during which magician David Copperfield sawed her in half using his antique Buzz Saw illusion.

<doc id="634932" wikidata="Q1320124" url="?curid=634932" title="Infatuation">
<text>Infatuation, also known as being smitten, is the personal state of being overly driven by an uninformed or otherwise unreasonable passion, usually towards another person for whom one has developed strong romantic or sexual feelings.

Psychologist Frank D. Cox said that infatuation could be distinguished from romantic love only when looking back on a particular case of being attracted to a person but which may also evolve into a mature love. Goldstein and Brandon describe infatuation as the first stage of a relationship before developing into a mature intimacy. Whereas love is &quot;a warm attachment, enthusiasm, or devotion to another person&quot;, infatuation is &quot;a feeling of foolish or obsessively strong love for, admiration for, or interest in someone or something&quot;, a shallower &quot;honeymoon phase&quot; in a relationship. Ian Kerner, a sex therapist, stated that infatuation usually occurred at the beginning of relationships, which is &quot;[...] marked by a sense of excitement and euphoria, and it&#x27;s often accompanied by lust and a feeling of newness and rapid expansion with a person&quot;. 

The psychologist Adam Phillips has described how illusions of infatuations inevitably resulted in disappointment when learning the truth about a lover. Adolescents often make people an object of extravagant, short-lived passion or temporary love.

==Youth==
&quot;It is customary to view young people&#x27;s dating relationships and first relationships as puppy love or infatuation&quot;; and if infatuation is both an early stage in a deepening sequence of love/attachment, &quot;and&quot; at the same time a potential stopping point, it is perhaps no surprise that it is a condition especially prevalent in the first, youthful explorations of the world of relationships. Thus &quot;the first passionate adoration of a youth for a celebrated actress whom he regards as far above him, to whom he scarcely dares lift his bashful eyes&quot; may be seen as part of an &quot;infatuation with celebrity especially perilous with the young&quot;.

Admiration plays a significant part in this, as &quot;in the case of a schoolgirl crush on a boy or on a male teacher. The girl starts off admiring the teacher ... [then] may get hung up on the teacher and follow him around&quot;. Then there may be shame at being confronted with the fact that &quot;you&#x27;ve got what&#x27;s called a crush on him ... Think if someone was hanging around &quot;you&quot;, pestering and sighing&quot;. Of course, &quot;sex may come into this ... with an infatuated schoolgirl or schoolboy&quot; as well, producing the &quot;stricken gaze, a compulsive movement of the throat ... an &#x27;I&#x27;m lying down and I don&#x27;t care if you walk on me, babe&#x27;, expression&quot; of infatuation. Such a cocktail of emotions &quot;may even falsify the &#x27;erotic sense of reality&#x27;: when a person in love estimates his partner&#x27;s virtues he is usually not very realistic ... projection of all his ideals onto the partner&#x27;s personality&quot;.

It is this projection that differentiates infatuation from love, according to the spiritual teacher Meher Baba: &quot;In infatuation, the person is a &quot;passive victim&quot; of the spell of conceived attraction for the object. In love there is an &quot;active appreciation&quot; of the intrinsic worth of the object of love.&quot;

Distance from the object of infatuation—as with celebrities—can help maintain the infatuated state. A time-honoured cure for the one who &quot;has a &quot;tendre&quot; ... infatuated&quot; is to have &quot;thrown them continually together ... by doing so you will cure ... [or] you will know that it is not an infatuation&quot;.

The possible effects of infatuation and love relationships on the academic behaviour of adolescent students were examined in research. The outcome shows that most of the participants had distraction, stress, and poor academic performance as a result of love relationships and infatuation. Furthermore, the findings highlighted that this has a detrimental effect on learning behaviour among teenagers who are in romantic or infatuated relationships.

==Types==
Three types of infatuation have been identified by Brown: the first type is characterized by being &quot;carried away, without insight or proper evaluative judgement, by blind desire&quot;; the second, closely related, by being &quot;compelled by a desire or craving over which the agent has no control&quot; while &quot;the agent&#x27;s evaluation ... may well be sound although the craving or love remains unaffected by it&quot;; and the third is that of &quot;the agent who exhibits bad judgement and misvaluation for reasons such as ignorance or recklessness&quot;.

==In transference==

In psychoanalysis, a sign that the method is taking hold is &quot;the initial infatuation to be observed at the beginning of treatment&quot;, the beginning of transference. The patient, in Freud&#x27;s words, &quot;develops a special interest in the person of the doctor ... never tires in his home of praising the doctor and of extolling ever new qualities in him&quot;. What occurs, &quot;it is usually maintained ... is a sort of false love, a shadow of love&quot;, replicating in its course the infatuations of &quot;what is called true love&quot;.

However, psychoanalyst Janet Malcolm claims that it is wrong to convince the patient &quot;that their love is an illusion ... that it&#x27;s not you she loves. Freud was off base when he wrote that. It &quot;is&quot; you. Who else could it be?&quot;—thereby taking &quot;the question of what is called true love ... further than it had ever been taken&quot;.

Conversely, in countertransference, the therapist may become infatuated with his/her client: &quot;very good-looking ... she was the most gratifying of patients. She made literary allusions and understood the ones he made ... He was dazzled by her, a little in love with her. After two years, the analysis ground down to a horrible halt&quot;.

==Intellectual infatuations==

Infatuations need not only involve people, but can extend to objects, activities, and ideas. &quot;Men are always falling in love with other men ... with their war heroes and sport heroes&quot;: with institutions, discourses and role models. Thus for example Jung&#x27;s initial unconditional devotion&#x27; to Freud&#x27;s theories and his &#x27;no less unconditional veneration&#x27; of Freud&#x27;s person&#x27; was seen at the time by both men as a &#x27;quasi-religious infatuation&#x27; to ... a cult object&quot;; while Freud in turn was &quot;very attracted by Jung&#x27;s personality&quot;, perhaps &quot;saw in Jung an idealized version of himself&quot;: a —&quot;intellectually infatuated with one another&quot;.

But there are also collective infatuations: &quot;we are all prone to being drawn into &quot;social phantasy systems&quot;&quot;. Thus, for instance, &quot;the recent intellectual infatuation with structuralism and post-structuralism&quot; arguably lasted at least until &quot;September 11 ended intellectual infatuation with postmodernism&quot; as a whole.

Economic bubbles thrive on collective infatuations of a different kind: &quot;all boom-bust processes contain an element of misunderstanding or misconception&quot;, whether it is the &quot;infatuation with ... becoming the latest dot.com billionaire&quot;, or the one that followed with subprime mortgages, once &quot;Greenspan had replaced the tech bubble with a housing bubble&quot;. As markets &quot;swung virtually overnight from euphoria to fear&quot; in the credit crunch, even the most hardened market fundamentalist had to concede that such &quot;periodic surges of euphoria and fear are manifestations of deep-seated aspects of human nature&quot;—whether these are enacted in home-room infatuations or upon the global stage.

==Literary depictions==

Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets have been described as a &quot;Poetics for Infatuation&quot;; as being dominated by one theme, and &quot;that theme is infatuation, its initiation, cultivation, and history, together with its peaks of triumph and devastation&quot;—a lengthy exploration of the condition of being &quot;subject to the appropriate disorders that belong to our infatuation ... the condition of infatuation&quot;. In Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;First Love&quot;, a novella from 1860, 16-year-old Woldemar becomes rapturously infatuated with Zinaida, the beautiful daughter of a princess who lives next to his house. Even though she does spend time with him, his intense infatuation is unrequited and he sinks into depression.

<text>Lisa Diane Whelchel (born May 29, 1963) is an American actress, singer, songwriter, author, and life coach. She is known for her appearances as a Mouseketeer on &quot;The New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; and her nine-year role as the preppy and wealthy Blair Warner on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. In 1984, she was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance for her contemporary Christian album &quot;All Because of You&quot;. In 2012, Whelchel participated as a contestant on the CBS competitive reality series &quot;&quot; and tied for second place. She was also voted fan favorite and was awarded $100,000.

== Early life ==

Lisa Whelchel was born on May 29, 1963, in Littlefield, Texas. She is the daughter of Virginia &quot;Genny&quot; (née French), a real estate agent, and James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Whelchel Sr., an electrician. Her parents divorced in 1981, and her mother married Roy Coleman in 1983. Lisa is the elder sister of James &quot;Cody&quot; Whelchel Jr., and the elder half-sister of Casey Justice Coleman. She also has a nephew, Chasin (Cody&#x27;s son). Lisa and Cody were raised for most of their childhood in Fort Worth, Texas, and she was in the class of 1980.

== Acting career ==
===&quot;The New Mickey Mouse Club&quot;===
At age 13, Whelchel was recruited in Texas by talent scouts who were looking for children interested in working with Disney Studios as a Mouseketeer on &quot;The New Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. She moved to California the next year and appeared on the show in syndication from 1977 to 1978.

===&quot;The Facts of Life&quot;===
Whelchel is probably best known for being a main cast member of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; where she portrayed Blair Warner, an uptight prep student. She also played the character on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, the show from which &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; spun off. Whelchel once refused a storyline that would have made her character the first among the four main young women on the show to lose her virginity. Having become a Christian when she was ten years old, Whelchel declined due to her religious beliefs, and the storyline was rewritten for the character of Natalie, portrayed by Mindy Cohn. This was the only episode of the series in which Whelchel did not appear.

In 2001, Whelchel reprised her role as Blair Warner for the made-for-television movie, &quot;The Facts of Life Reunion&quot;.

On March 7, 2004, Whelchel was reunited with Charlotte Rae to perform &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; theme song at the 2nd Annual TV Land Awards at the Hollywood Palladium in Hollywood. In spring 2006, she appeared with two of her &quot;Facts of Life&quot; co-stars on &quot;The Today Show&quot; to promote the show&#x27;s DVD releases of the first and second seasons, admitting to being &quot;really bummed out&quot; that Kim Fields was unable to attend. On February 1, 2007, Whelchel was reunited with Fields on WFAA-TV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Texas&quot;. Fields was in Dallas to promote her appearance in the production &quot;Issues: We&#x27;ve All Got &#x27;Em″&quot;, when Whelchel was introduced as a surprise guest. On April 10, 2011, Whelchel and the cast of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, including Charlotte Rae, Nancy McKeon, Mindy Cohn, Kim Fields, Geri Jewell, and Cloris Leachman were honored with the Pop Culture Award at the 9th Annual TV Land Awards at the Javits Center in New York City.

In 2021, Whelchel, Fields, and Cohn reunited again on the set of &quot;Live in Front of a Studio Audience&quot;&#x27;s reenactment of the show&#x27;s third season episode &quot;Kids Can Be Cruel&quot;. Whelchel also sang the show&#x27;s theme song that evening.

Cohn has said that before his death, Norman Lear thought about a reboot of the series, however &quot;one of the girls&quot; went behind the others&#x27; backs and tried to work out a separate deal for a spinoff of her character. Rumors indicate it was Whelchel.

== Music career ==
In 1984, Whelchel released a Christian pop album entitled &quot;All Because of You&quot;. The album reached No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Contemporary Christian music charts. She was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance and was recognized as the writer of the title song, &quot;All Because of You&quot;. Among the songs featured on the album were &quot;All Because of You&quot;, &quot;Just Obey&quot;, &quot;Cover Me Lord&quot;, and &quot;Good Girl&quot;. She did not record a second album. While she was appearing on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, she made a cameo appearance in the music video for contemporary Christian music singer-songwriter Steve Taylor&#x27;s song &quot;Meltdown (at Madame Tussaud&#x27;s)&quot;. The song was the title track from the album &quot;Meltdown&quot;.

== Speaking ==
For years, Whelchel was a regular inspirational speaker at churches and conferences nationwide. In 2000, she founded Momtime Ministries, a religious network of mothers&#x27; groups who met weekly to &quot;equip and refresh and encourage&quot; each other.

In 2021, Whelchel appeared on friend and &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; co-star Mindy Cohn’s podcast, &quot;Mondays with Mindy&quot;, on which she talked about how her faith has changed and evolved over time. She explained that her speaking commitments have shifted over the years, as she no longer operates from a &quot;fear-based, punishment-based&quot; mentality. She explained, &quot;Jesus came, ultimately, to bring grace. I can speak that message in any situation, but a lot of churches — when they find out that I believe that there are many ways to experience God, not just Jesus, then the invitations kind of dry up.&quot;

== Writing ==
Whelchel has written ten books on motherhood, child discipline, adult friendships, homeschooling, and finding Jesus through the development of holiday traditions. Additional topics from a spiritual point of view include prayer and wisdom. She is the bestselling author of &quot;So You&#x27;re Thinking About Homeschooling&quot; and &quot;The Facts of Life (and Other Lessons My Father Taught Me)&quot;.

==&quot;Survivor&quot;==
On August 20, 2012, Whelchel was announced as a contestant in &quot;&quot; as a member of the Tandang tribe. She joined retired Major League Baseball star Jeff Kent as one of the season&#x27;s two &quot;celebrity&quot; contestants. A former television star, she elected to keep her true identity a secret from the other contestants, many of whom were too young to have watched &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; during its original run and thus did not recognize her. Michael Skupin and Jonathan Penner, who were around Whelchel&#x27;s age, as well as eventual winner Denise Stapley, were the only ones to recognize her as &quot;Blair Warner&quot;.

On November 14, 2012, Whelchel announced via her Twitter account that she was suffering from West Nile fever and had been advised by her doctor that recovery would take approximately one year. She did not specify whether she had contracted the arbovirus while in the Philippines shooting &quot;Survivor&quot;.

On December 16, 2012, Whelchel made it to the Final Tribal Council, where fellow contestant and jury member Jonathan Penner revealed to the rest of the jury that she was a former child star. In the end, she received one jury vote from RC Saint-Amour and tied with returning contestant Michael Skupin for runner-up, both losing to eventual winner Denise Stapley. She was also voted the Sprint Player of the Season, winning $100,000 by a margin of about .7 percent against Malcolm Freberg.

==Hosting duties==
On January 14, 2013, Whelchel co-hosted several episodes of &quot;The Jeff Probst Show&quot; with &quot;Survivor&quot; host, Jeff Probst.

In April 2019, Whelchel hosted a &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; marathon on the MeTV television network, as a lead-in for a preview of her series &quot;Collector&#x27;s Call&quot; that debuted later that year and will be in Season 6 slated to begin in 2025.

==Personal life==
On July 9, 1988, Whelchel married Steven Cauble, who was an associate pastor at The Church on the Way in Van Nuys, California, which Whelchel attended at the time. The couple, who have three adult children, divorced in March 2012. In 2019, Whelchel married Pete Harris, who is a psychologist based in Nashville, Tennessee.

<doc id="634940" wikidata="Q2009326" url="?curid=634940" title="Butterscotch">
<text>Butterscotch is a type of confection whose primary ingredients are brown sugar and butter. Some recipes include corn syrup, cream, vanilla, and salt. The earliest known recipes, in mid-19th century Yorkshire, used treacle (molasses) in place of, or in addition to, sugar.

Butterscotch is similar to toffee, but the sugar is boiled to the soft crack stage, not hard crack. Often credited with their invention, S. Parkinson &amp; Sons of Doncaster made butterscotch boiled sweets and sold them in tins, which became one of the town&#x27;s best-known exports. They became famous in 1851 after Queen Victoria was presented with a tin when she visited the town. Butterscotch sauce, made of butterscotch and cream, is used as a topping for ice cream (particularly sundaes).

The term &quot;butterscotch&quot; is also often used more specifically for the flavour of brown sugar and butter together, even if the actual confection butterscotch is not involved, such as in butterscotch pudding (a type of custard).

==Etymology==
Food historians have several theories regarding the name and origin of this confectionery, but none is conclusive. One explanation is the meaning &quot;to cut or score&quot; for the word &quot;scotch&quot;, as the confection must be cut into pieces, or &quot;scotched&quot;, before hardening. Alternatively, the &quot;scotch&quot; may derive from the word &quot;&quot;. In 1855, F. K. Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Glossary of Yorkshire Words&quot; explained Butterscotch as &quot;a treacle ball with an amalgamation of butter in it&quot;.

==History==

Early mentions of butterscotch associate the confection with Doncaster in Yorkshire. An 1848 issue of the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; gave a recipe for &quot;Doncaster butterscotch&quot; as &quot;one pound of butter, one pound of sugar and a quarter of a pound of treacle, boiled together&quot; ( each of butter and sugar and treacle).

By 1851, Doncaster butterscotch was sold commercially by rival confectioners S. Parkinson &amp; Sons (the original Parkinson recipe is still made today), Henry Hall, and Booth&#x27;s via agents elsewhere in Yorkshire. Parkinson&#x27;s started to use and advertise the Doncaster Church as their trademark. It was advertised as &quot;Royal Doncaster Butterscotch&quot;, or &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Sweetmeat&quot;, and said to be &quot;the best emollient for the chest in the winter season&quot;. Parkinson&#x27;s Butterscotch was by appointment to the royal household and was presented to the Princess Elizabeth, then the Duchess of Edinburgh, in 1948 and to Anne, Princess Royal in 2007. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the British sweet became popular in the U.S.

==Packaging and products==
Butterscotch is often used as a flavour for items such as dessert sauce, pudding, and biscuits (cookies). To that end, it can be bought in &quot;butterscotch chips&quot; made with hydrogenated (solid) fats to be similar for baking use to chocolate chips.

Also, individually wrapped, translucent yellow hard candies (butterscotch disks) are made with an artificial butterscotch flavour. In addition, butterscotch-flavoured liqueur is in production.

Champion and Reeves make luxury traditional butterscotch in Shropshire, with British butter and British double cream, wrapped in individual foil wrappers.

==Sauce==
Butterscotch sauce is made of brown sugar cooked to mixed with butter and cream.

<doc id="634943" wikidata="Q651733" url="?curid=634943" title="Llandovery">
<text>Llandovery (; ; ) is a market town and community in Carmarthenshire, Wales. It lies on the River Tywi and at the junction of the A40 and A483 roads, about north-east of Carmarthen, north of Swansea and west of Brecon.

==History==
===Etymology===
The name of the town derives from &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;church enclosure amid the waters&quot;, i.e. between the Tywi and the Afon Brân just upstream of their confluence. A smaller watercourse, the Bawddwr, runs through and under the town.

===Roman legacy===
The Roman fort at Llanfair Hill to the north-east of the modern town was known to the Romans as Alabum. It was built around AD 50–60 as part of a strategy for the conquest of Wales. A Roman road heads across Mynydd Bach Trecastell to the south-east of Llandovery bound for the fort of Brecon Gaer. Another heads down the Towy valley for Carmarthen, whilst a third makes for the goldmines at Dolaucothi.

===Norman and medieval castle===

Attractions in the town include the remains of the Norman Llandovery Castle, built in 1110. It was almost immediately captured by the Welsh and changed hands between them and the Normans until the reign of King Edward I of England in the late 13th century. The castle was used by King Henry IV while on a sortie into Wales, when he executed Llywelyn ap Gruffydd Fychan in the market place. It was later attacked by the forces of Owain Glyndŵr in 1403.

===Welsh hero===
A stainless-steel statue to Llywelyn ap Gruffydd Fychan was unveiled in 2001 on the north side of Llandovery Castle, overlooking the place of his execution 600 years earlier. He had led the army of King Henry IV on a &quot;wild goose chase&quot;, under the pretence of leading them to a secret rebel camp and an ambush of Glyndŵr&#x27;s forces. King Henry lost patience with him, exposed the charade and had him half hanged, disembowelled in front of his own eyes, beheaded and quartered – the quarters salted and dispatched to other Welsh towns for public display.

The design of the statue, by Toby and Gideon Petersen, was chosen after a national competition. It was funded by the National Lottery and the Arts Council of Wales.

===Other history===
According to folklore, the Physicians of Myddfai practised in the area in the 13th century.

The Bank of the Black Ox, one of the first Welsh banks, was established by a wealthy cattle drover. The original bank building was part of the King&#x27;s Head Inn. It later became part of Lloyds Bank.

The population in 1841 was 1,709.

==Buildings==
The town has a theatre (Llandovery Theatre), a heritage centre, a private school (Llandovery College) and a tourist information and heritage centre, which houses exhibitions on the Tonn Press, the area&#x27;s droving history, and the 19th-century geologist Sir Roderick Impey Murchison, whose work here resulted in the name &quot;Llandovery&quot; being given to rocks of a certain age across the world. The Llandovery epoch is the earliest in the Silurian period of geological time.

In the small central market place stands Llandovery Town Hall (1857–1858) by the architect Richard Kyke Penson. This was designed in the Italianate style with a courtroom over an open market. Behind are police cells with iron grilles; entry to the old courtroom (now a library) is via a door on the ground floor of the tower.
There are two medieval churches in Llandovery: the 14th-century St Dingat&#x27;s to the west of the town centre, and the 12th-century St Mary&#x27;s on the northern outskirts of the town. St Dingat&#x27;s is a Grade II* listed building, and one of the largest medieval churches in Carmarthenshire. It stands on a site which appears to have been in religious use since pre-Norman times. St Mary&#x27;s is a Grade I listed building and was formerly the parish church for the neighbouring parish of Llanfair-ar-y-bryn, despite not being within that parish&#x27;s boundaries. It subsequently became a chapel of ease to St Dingat&#x27;s in 1883 after a new church for Llanfair-ar-y-bryn was built within the parish boundaries.

The Memorial Chapel in Stryd y Bont was built as a memorial to the hymnist William Williams Pantycelyn.

==Education==
The town&#x27;s comprehensive school, Ysgol Pantycelyn, with about 300 pupils, was closed on 31 August 2013 and merged with Ysgol Tre-Gib in Ffairfach to form Ysgol Bro Dinefwr.

The town has an independent day and boarding school, Llandovery College.

==Sport==
Llandovery has a leading Welsh Premiership rugby union team, Llandovery RFC, nicknamed The Drovers, active as such since at least 1877 and a founder member of the Welsh Rugby Union. It has successful junior and youth sections. A number of former players have gone on to represent Wales (and some other nations) in international rugby. Home games are played at its ground in Church Bank.

Llandovery Junior Football Club has a membership of over 70 from Llandovery and its surrounding area. It provides coaching and competitive scope for all aged 6 to 16 years. The club currently has an Under 14 team in the Carmarthenshire Junior League, and Under 11 and Under 8 teams playing in the Carmarthen Mini Football League.

A Llandovery Golf Club, founded in 1910, survived until the onset of the Second World War. Golfing now takes place on the Llandovery College 9-hole course.

There are two tiers of local government covering Llandovery, at community (town) and county level: Llandovery Town Council (Cyngor Tref Llanymddyfri) and Carmarthenshire County Council (Cyngor Sir Gâr). The town council meets at the Town Hall in the Market Square.

The community is bordered by those of Llanfair-ar-y-bryn, Myddfai, Llanwrda, and Cilycwm, all being in Carmarthenshire.

Llandovery is twinned with Pluguffan in Brittany, France.

===Administrative history===
Llandovery historically formed part of the parish of Llandingat. Llandovery was the main settlement in the parish, which was named after its parish church of St Dingat&#x27;s. The parish included surrounding rural areas as well as Llandovery. Llandovery appears to have been an ancient borough, although its earliest known charter was not issued until 1485 by Richard III. The borough covered the central part of Llandingat parish, including St Dingat&#x27;s church.

The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. The Local Government Act 1894 directed that civil parishes could no longer straddle borough boundaries, and so Llandingat parish was split into a Llandingat Within parish covering the same area as the borough of Llandovery, and a Llandingat Without parish covering the areas outside the borough.

The borough of Llandovery was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Llandovery was created instead, covering the area of the abolished borough, with its community council taking the name Llandovery Town Council. District-level functions passed to Dinefwr Borough Council. Carmarthenshire County Council was abolished as part of the same reforms, with county-level functions passing to the new Dyfed County Council. Dinefwr and Dyfed were both abolished in 1996 and their councils&#x27; functions passed to a re-established Carmarthenshire County Council. Llandingat Without also became a community under the 1974 reforms; it was abolished in 1987 and split between the community of Llandovery and other neighbouring communities.

==Transport==
Llandovery stands at the junction of the main A40 and A483 roads.

Llandovery railway station is on the Heart of Wales line, with services in the direction of and of .

<text>Kezar Stadium () is an outdoor athletics stadium in San Francisco, California, located adjacent to Kezar Pavilion in the southeastern corner of Golden Gate Park. It serves as the home of San Francisco City FC of USL League Two.

It is the original home of the San Francisco 49ers and the Oakland Raiders (first AFL season only) of the National Football League (NFL).

Kezar also hosts amateur and recreation sports leagues, as well as numerous San Francisco high school football games (including the city championship, known popularly as the &quot;Turkey Bowl&quot;).

==History==
In 1920, Jack Spaulding proposed an athletics stadium for San Francisco, seating 50,000. Many business leaders in the city backed him, as it would keep San Francisco level with other cities with large stadiums. Areas under consideration for the stadium were 7th &amp; Harrison Streets, Ocean Shore, and the Central Park grounds.

In 1922, the San Francisco Park Commission accepted a $100,000 gift from the estate of Mary Kezar to build a memorial in honor of her mother and uncles, who were pioneers in the area. After the City and County of San Francisco appropriated an additional $200,000, the stadium was built in a year. Dedication ceremonies were on May 2, 1925, and featured a two-mile (3.2 km) footrace between Ville Ritola and Paavo Nurmi of Finland, two of the great runners of the era. A little over a month later, the new stadium hosted the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.

The stadium had many uses in the 1930s. In addition to track and field competitions, Kezar Stadium hosted motorcycle racing, auto racing, rugby, lacrosse, soccer, baseball, boxing, cricket, and football. In September 1932, the Australian Cricket Team played a North California all-star team in the Australians&#x27; 56-game tour of the U.S. and Canada. The stadium was also home to several colleges (Santa Clara, USF, St. Mary&#x27;s), Lowell High School, and the now-defunct San Francisco Polytechnic High School. In 1926, the stadium also became the home of the 

===American football===
====High school====
In 1928, the city high school championship game between cross-town rivals San Francisco Polytechnic and Lowell drew more than 50,000—still the record for a high school football game in northern California. Local Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory plays most of their home games at Kezar. The annual Bruce-Mahoney rivalry football game between St. Ignatius College Preparatory and Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory is held at the new (smaller) stadium.

====College====
The annual East-West Shrine Game of 1931 was replaced by a raucous Knights of Columbus game featuring the Savoldi All-Stars. Prescott Sullivan, a &quot;San Francisco News Call Bulletin&quot; sportswriter, recounted the day&#x27;s events in his January 26 column. &quot;Jumping Joe&quot; Savoldi gave some very sound reasons why Knute Rockne calls him &quot;modern football&#x27;s greatest fullback&quot; yesterday when he led a team composed largely of California and U.S.C. stars to a 13–0 victory over Ernie Nevers and a supporting cast of St. Mary&#x27;s players at Kezar Stadium. More than 30,000 customers put the Knights of Columbus&#x27; grid finales over in a big way and saw &quot;Jumping Joe&quot; and his playmates cinch their victory with two spectacular fourth period touchdowns. These runs, end to end, constituted a very sizable day&#x27;s work for &quot;Jumping Joe&quot;, and the crowd showed deep appreciation by mobbing him at the finish of the ball game. Savoldi managed to escape by throwing his headgear to the milling throng, and long after the players had left the field of action, Joe&#x27;s helmet was still at the center of a battle royal. More than 200 enthusiastic souvenir hunters joined in the fight, which continued to rage unabated outside the stadium after police had managed to chase the combatants from the big bowl. Numerous black eyes were exchanged before mounted police finally quelled the uprising. Such is Savoldi&#x27;s fame!&quot;

Stanford University played four of its home football games at Kezar: one in 1928 and three in 1942. Stanford was also part of the first-ever major college football double header in 1940, which featured Stanford–San Francisco and Santa Clara–Utah.

====Professional====
Kezar Stadium was the first home of the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders, as well as many NFL Hall of Famers, historical NFL games, and the first &quot;alley-oop&quot;. The Raiders played at Kezar for their first four home games in 1960, and at Candlestick Park during the remainder of their first two seasons, before Frank Youell Field was built as a temporary facility in Oakland. Defensive end Jim Marshall of the visiting Minnesota Vikings had his famous &quot;wrong way run&quot; at Kezar in 1964, against the 49ers on October 25.

Kezar had a poor reputation among NFL players. In his 1987 memoir, Hall of Fame defensive tackle Art Donovan recalls the &quot;look of dread&quot; worn by visiting teams arriving at the stadium, owing to its inadequate dressing rooms, long, dusty tunnel to the field, shredded turf that was a byproduct of rain and overuse, and &quot;god damned seagulls&quot; that would arrive in the fourth quarter and &quot;start shitting on you like they were aiming.&quot;

The 49ers played the final NFL game at Kezar in early 1971, losing the 1970 NFC Championship Game to the Dallas Cowboys 17–10 on January 3. The 49ers moved to the more modern and accessible Candlestick Park for the 1971 season, and played there through 2013.

Kezar Stadium was also the home field of the San Francisco Stingrayz women&#x27;s professional football team from until the team was forced to end their season due to a bus accident that injured many players. The Stingrayz were one of the Bay Area&#x27;s women&#x27;s tackle football teams in the Women&#x27;s Professional Football League, and then the Independent Women&#x27;s Football League.

===1970s and 1980s===

====&quot;Dirty Harry&quot;====
Months after the 49ers&#x27; departure, several scenes from the 1971 film &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; were filmed at and above the stadium. The film&#x27;s fictional antagonist, Scorpio (played by Andrew Robinson), worked as the caretaker at the stadium and lived under the grandstand.

====Concerts====
With the loss of professional football in 1971, the stadium became a popular outdoor concert venue, and its proximity to the Haight-Ashbury District helped with the transition. Notable music events included the SNACK Benefit Concert in 1975. Among performers from that event and others were The Doobie Brothers, Jefferson Starship, Tower of Power, Joan Baez, Grateful Dead, Santana, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Graham Central Station and Led Zeppelin.

===Demolition and reconstruction===

With pending demolition, the bleacher planks of Kezar Stadium were sold off to fans at a party in April 1989. In June, the stadium was demolished and rebuilt with a much smaller seating capacity of 10,000. The upgrades included an eight-lane, all-weather track and a grass athletic infield suitable for soccer, football, and lacrosse.

During the reconstruction, the field and track configurations were shifted several degrees counterclockwise, to move the stadium away from Frederick Street. The evidence for this can be seen by examining photos of the tunnel entrance at the east end of the field, which used to be exactly on the long axis of the track. A replica of the original concrete arch bearing the name &quot;Kezar Stadium&quot; was built on the west side of the stadium as a tribute to the original structure. A plaque of NFL Hall of Famer Bob St. Clair, a San Francisco native who played 11 pro seasons (1953–63) with the 49ers, plus his high school (S.F. Poly) and most of his college career (USF) at Kezar Stadium, is built into the replica arch.

===2014–2015 renovation===
Kezar Stadium was closed for renovations from September 2014 until March 2015. The $3.2-million renovation included new entry walk paving, upgraded sound system, new perimeter walkways and curbs, installation of new Mondo running track surface, and striping for nine 42” lanes. In addition, 1,000 historic Candlestick Park seats were installed for the public to enjoy. The renovation was funded by the city&#x27;s Capital Planning General Fund. Mayor Edwin M. Lee helped re-open the stadium with a warm-up run.

In December 2016, 4,000 additional historic Candlestick seats were acquired and installed at Kezar. The seats were paid for by the San Francisco Deltas as a part of a $1-million improvement the team agreed upon to make use of the stadium.

==Soccer and other sports==
In 1967 it served as the home stadium for the San Francisco Golden Gate Gales of the United Soccer Association.

With the 2006 West Coast expansion of Major League Lacrosse, Kezar Stadium once again became a home to a professional team, the San Francisco Dragons. In October 2006, United Soccer Leagues (USL) and Spanish football club Deportivo Alavés announced that the new pro soccer team, named California Victory, would play their 2007 home games at Kezar. The Victory played in the USL&#x27;s First Division, one level below Major League Soccer. However, Alaves later withdrew their support and the team folded.

Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory, a nearby Catholic high school uses the field for their home football games. Mission High School also uses the field for home games. Kezar has also been the host of several Northern California Semi-pro football championship games.

In 2010, 2011, and 2012, Stanford University held its spring football game at Kezar. For the 2012 and 2016 San Francisco Olympic bids, Kezar was designated to host field hockey had San Francisco been chosen in either year.

From 2001 to present, Kezar has been the home field for San Francisco City FC, a supporter-owned club playing in USL Two.

In 2017, Kezar became the home field for the San Francisco Deltas, a professional soccer team playing in the North American Soccer League (NASL). The Deltas have contributed over $1-million in renovations to the stadium. However, Deltas announced that they would be concluding operations and the team folded.

In February 2018, San Francisco City FC announced they would return to Kezar Stadium for the 2018 PDL season.

===Women&#x27;s soccer===
The San Francisco Nighthawks, founded in 1995 and a member of the Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League, play their home games at Kezar. The Bay Area Breeze of the W-League started play there in 2013.

===College lacrosse===
Kezar is also the home to the annual San Francisco Fall Lacrosse Classic, an NCAA Division I fall ball game started in 2009 to benefit the Bay Area Youth Sports Foundation. The first event was between Brown and North Carolina. It was the first Division I men&#x27;s lacrosse played in Northern California. North Carolina beat Brown 13–5 in front of a crowd of more than 4,500. The 2010 event featured lacrosse powerhouse Johns Hopkins and Notre Dame on Saturday, October 16, 2010. Notre Dame beat Hopkins 10–7. The third installment took place on Saturday, October 8, 2011, and featured the University of Denver and Harvard University. The fourth installment took place Sunday October 21, 2012 in a match between Lehigh and Ohio State. As a direct result of the San Francisco Fall Lacrosse Classic, the BAYS Foundation has made over $225,000 in grants to local youth sports and educations programs for under-resourced children throughout the Bay Area.

===Other sports===
In 2013, Kezar was home to the Major League Ultimate (MLU) team, the San Francisco Dogfish.

Kezar was home to the San Francisco GAA football league (Gaelic football).
In 2004 it served as the home of the San Francisco Freedom, the city&#x27;s Pro Cricket team.

<text>Dr Tonea Stewart (born February 3, 1947), also Tommie Stewart, is an American actress and university professor. She is the former dean of the College of Visual and Performing Arts of Alabama State University in Montgomery, Alabama.

She had a recurring role as Aunt Etta Kibby in the American television series &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, and is an NAACP Image Award nominee for acting in film &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;.

From the beginning of her acting career until 2019, Stewart concurrently worked as an actress and educator; she did not act full time until her retirement from teaching.

== Early life and education ==

Stewart was born in Greenwood, Mississippi, the daughter of Hattie (née Leonard) and Thomas Harris. Her father worked as an electrician and plumber, while Stewart&#x27;s mother was an educator. They would divorce when Stewart was 4 years old. Her sister, Beverly Branson, is a singer, and the two have performed together on stage.

Her original intention was to become a doctor, and she studied biology at Jackson State University. However, after acting in a school production, Stewart changed her major to theater. She earned a BS degree in speech and theater at Jackson, and then studied theater at the University of California at Santa Barbara. In 1989, Stewart received a PhD in theater arts from Florida State University.

==Acting career==
Stewart&#x27;s first performance on screen was in TV movie &quot;Nightmare in Badham County&quot; (1976). She appeared as Mrs. Walker in film &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988). From 1991 to 1993, Stewart played Aunt Etta Kibby on &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. On the series, she had previously portrayed a different character, and returned under this new role as producers were impressed with her performance. Stewart acted in the feature films &quot;Body Snatchers&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; Large&quot;, &quot;Mississippi Damned&quot; and &quot;Girls Trip&quot;.

She has made guest appearances on television series &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. She played Gwen Hailey, the wife of Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s character, in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996). Stewart received an NAACP Image Award nomination for her work in this film. In &quot;Come Sunday&quot; (2018), she portrayed the mother of Pentecostal bishop Carlton Pearson.

<doc id="634957" wikidata="Q787395" url="?curid=634957" title="Llanfairfechan">
<text>; ) is a town and community in the Conwy County Borough, Wales. It is known as a seaside resort and had a population at the 2001 Census of 3,755, reducing to 3,637 at the 2011 Census. The history of the area dates back to at least Roman times, as demonstrated by the discovery of a large second century milestone, which is now preserved in the British Museum.

==History==
There are a number of prehistoric sites on the hills above the village. The most important of these today is the old hillfort of Dinas; but the large defensive fortress of Braich-y-Dinas, at the summit of Penmaenmawr, was among the largest in Britain and Ireland until it was finally destroyed by quarrying at the start of the 20th century.

As in the case of Penmaenmawr, the present town grew up as a granite quarrying town and a seaside town from the mid-19th century onwards. At one time there were hundreds of men working in the Penmaenmawr quarry, but today quarrying has stopped completely on this side of the mountain.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Llanfairfechan, at community (town) level and principal area (county borough) level: Llanfairfechan Town Council (Cyngor Tref Llanfairfechan) and Conwy County Borough Council. The town council is based at the Town Hall on Village Road.

===Administrative history===
Llanfairfechan was an ancient parish within the historic county of Caernarfonshire. In 1872 the parish was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board.

Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Llanfairfechan Urban District was abolished in 1974, with its area becoming a community in the Aberconwy borough of the new county of Gwynedd. Further reforms in 1996 abolished the boroughs and counties created in 1974, and Llanfairfechan was placed in the new Conwy County Borough. For the ceremonial purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty, Llanfairfechan remained in the preserved county of Gwynedd until 2003, when the whole of Conwy County Borough was placed in the preserved county of Clwyd.

==Transport connections==
The town lies on the north coast on the route of the A55 road, between Penmaenmawr and Bangor. It has a railway station on the North Wales Coast Line. It, however, is in the unusual situation where there is only one public road that connects it with the remainder of the British road network, which is the A55 road North Wales Expressway.

==Notable sites==
Morfa Madryn, the salt marsh area immediately west of the town on the shore of Traeth Lafan, is a local authority-managed nature reserve of outstanding beauty and a favourite haunt of bird watchers. The site is home to cormorants and shags. The rare little egret can also be spotted. It is also not far from Aber Falls.

Llanfairfechan is also home to Bryn y Neuadd Hospital, a learning disability facility, a mental health unit (Carreg Fawr) and a medium-secure unit (Tŷ Llywelyn). The site, Bryn Y Neuadd, is also home to the control centres for both the Emergency and Non-Emergency Ambulance services for the north.

Llanfairfechan was judged North Wales Calor Village of the Year for 2009 in the competition run by Calor Gas UK

The earlier Llanfairfechan Golf Club was founded in 1909. This club continued until the early 1950s. There is still a golf club operating in the town under the same name.

Wern Isaf (Rosebriars) is a house and garden designed by the architect Herbert Luck North. Born in Llanfairfechan, Luck North studied in London under Henry Wilson and Edwin Lutyens, before returning to build a substantial practice in Wales. His home is a Grade II listed building and its garden is listed, also at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

== Welsh language ==
According to the 2011 Census, 45.3% of the population of the town can speak Welsh. 66.2% of the town&#x27;s population who were born in Wales noted that they could speak the language.

The two schools situated in Llanfairfechan, Ysgol Pant-y-Rhedyn and Ysgol Babanod Llanfairfechan, are categorized as being predominantly English-medium schools but with significant use of Welsh.

== Town twinning ==
In 2011, the process of town-twinning between Llanfairfechan and Pleumeleuc was completed over the first weekend of June. A number of events were held over the weekend, including trips to local attractions and guided tours around Llanfairfechan itself.

<doc id="634959" wikidata="Q502264" url="?curid=634959" title="Humenné">
<text>Humenné (; ; ) is a town in the Prešov Region (&quot;kraj&quot;) in eastern Slovakia and the second largest town of the historic Zemplín region. It lies at the volcanic Vihorlat mountains and at the confluence of the Laborec and Cirocha Rivers.

==Names and etymology==
The name comes from a common Slavic word &quot;humno&quot; (gumьno). In Slovak &quot;backyard&quot;, the exact meaning may differ in dialects. Initially, a female adjective (1322 &quot;Homonna&quot;, 1332 &quot;Humenna&quot;, 1381 &quot;Humenna&quot;, 1391 &quot;Humonna&quot;) then neutrum &quot;Humenné&quot;.

==Landmarks==
Humenné is a center of one of the easternmost districts (&quot;okres&quot;) in Slovakia. The most attractive places are the Vihorlat Mountains boasting of their Morské oko lake, and the Bukovské vrchy (section of the Bieszczady Mountains) at the border of Slovakia, Poland, and Ukraine, which are part of the Poloniny National Park. Humenné is surrounded by ruins of medieval castles and an open-air museum of architecture situated in the town park.

Castles and mansions near Humenné:

* Brekov Castle (in ruins, to the southwest)
* Jasenov Castle (in ruins, to the south)
* Čičava Castle (in ruins, to the southwest )
* Kamenica nad Cirochou: Classicistic mansion from 1773 (at the moment closed for public, to the east)

==History==
The Laborec River and the Carpathian Mountains predetermined the development of the town and its surroundings, a silent witness of which has been the volcano Vihorlat – with a summit elevation of , the highest point of the Vihorlat mountains. Thanks to its advantageous location and pleasant climate, preconditioned by the neighboring mountains, the town has been an attractive place for people since the Stone Age, which is evidenced by a number of archeological findings. The Slavic forefathers of the Slovaks gradually moved to the basin of Humenné during the great migration of peoples, starting in the 5th century.

An intensive and organized settlement of this area started as late as in the middle of the 13th century, after the Mongol raids. The first written document mentioning Humenné dates back to 1317. The history of Humenné is closely connected with the Drugeth (Drugets, Drugetovci), a distinguished aristocratic family originally from Naples, who, accompanying the king Charles Robert of Anjou, came to the Kingdom of Hungary (the territory of present-day Slovakia was part of the Kingdom of Hungary) at the beginning of the 14th century. The Drugeths made Humenné their seat and changed it into the centre of one of the largest feudal dominions in Upper-Hungary. King Matthias Corvinus conferred civic privileges (town status) on the town, which were validated by a seal with coat of arms. At that time, the town was crossed by an important trade route connecting the Kingdom of Hungary with the Kingdom of Poland. Humenné is mentioned among royal customs offices, and later on it received the right of storehousing and supposedly market rights, too. This was also the time of an ever-increasing influence of shepherd colonization from Transcarpathia by the so-called Walachians (Ruthenes, Poles, and Romanians).

The most significant town monument, a Renaissance castle, was built on the place of an original stone castle in about 1610. The castle came to be an indispensable characteristic feature of the town and serves for museum and cultural purposes at present.

In 1613, during the Counter Reformation, a Jesuit college was established as the first secondary school in the history of Humenné.

In 1619, about 10,000 Polish riders—a lisowczycy—led by Walenty Rogawski, defeated army of George I Rákóczi in Battle of Humenné. Rákóczi was insurgent against Habsburgs and ally of Gábor Bethlen, Duke of Transylvania.

The Drugeth line died out in 1684 and new feudal lords moved in, notably the Csákys and the Wandernats.

The abolition of some feudal duties and the reforms of Maria Theresa promoted the development of crafts, and Humenné became the seat of the so-called &quot;salt office&quot;. The town&#x27;s population consisted of Slovaks, Ruthenes, Hungarians and Jews. Latin was used as the administrative language, which appeared to be a stabilizing factor in such a mixture of nationalities.

The Andrássy family from Transylvania started to influence the history of Humenné in the 19th century, a period characterized by economic growth. Moreover, many new buildings were erected at that time. The main fields of activities of town inhabitants were agriculture, crafts and trade. The first train appeared in Humenné in 1871, stimulating the development of trade and wood cutting. In 1899 the first business academy in Austria-Hungary was established in Humenné. Toward the end of the 19th century, Humenné counted 4,000 inhabitants.

The 20th century brought along a cultural revival. Humenné was famous for its markets and fairs. This promising, though timid, development was interrupted by World War I. A short period of the existence of Czechoslovakia between the two world wars proved to have positive effects upon the life of Humenné. As a corollary of World War II, however, all the effort had to start from the very beginning. On 26 November 1944, Humenné was captured by troops of the Soviet 18th Army, acting as a part of the 4th Ukrainian Front, after which the town became again part of Czechoslovakia.

Until 1956 Humenné was an administrative rather than an economic centre. Then the construction of a plant for the production of textile polyamide fibres, the present Chemlon company, triggered a real chain effect on the town&#x27;s growth. Humenné was gradually becoming a centre of chemical, building, food and mechanical engineering industries. This had a positive impact on the development of technical colleges. The industrial development entailed large-scale housing projects, and the town area was completed by new housing estates. While there were 7,000 inhabitants living in Humenné in 1948, the population now amounts over 33,000.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census, the town had 34,634 inhabitants. However, along with the surrounding villages that make up the town-ring, Humenné has some 42 thousand inhabitants. 79% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 6.5% Rusyns, 2.33% Roma, 1.16% Ukrainian and 0.49% Czechs. The religious makeup was 57.91% Roman Catholics, 23.00% Greek Catholics, 8.69% people with no religious affiliation, 5.91% Orthodox and 0.98% Lutherans.

In 1910, 48.6% were Roman Catholic, 34.8% Jewish, 12.3% Greek Catholic, while 38.2% reported Hungarian as their primary language, 30.8% Slovak and 21.1% Yiddish or German.

==Sports==

===Football===
Humenné had one club with top flight history: FC Chemlon Humenné, winning Slovak Cup in 1996. FC Chemlon also played UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in the 1996–97 season. The club had a more turbulent time during its name changes as; HFC Humenné, 1. HFC Humenné and ŠK Futura Humenné and could not replicate its success as Chemlon. In August 2015, the licence of ŠK Futura was bought by FK Drustav Svidník, but the Slovak Football Association rules do not allow to change club names only a few days before the start of the season. The Svidník club also announced a merger between FK Drustav and ŠK Futura within one year with a new name.

FK Humenné is the second club in Humenné, established in 2003, playing home matches at the Ihrisko pri Mlyne Stadium, they currently play in the 4th division.

===Volleyball===
Humenné had one of the most successful team VK Chemes Humenné in Slovak volleyball but due to dispute between owner and town about finance, club was transferred to another town Spišká Nová Ves. Nowadays no one volleyball club is in Humenné.

===Ice hockey===
The city&#x27;s ice hockey club is MHK Humenné, that competes in Slovak 1.Liga (2nd level).

<doc id="634960" wikidata="Q7642640" url="?curid=634960" title="Super Play (Sweden)">
<text>Super Play (often abbreviated SP) was a Swedish video game magazine. Started in March 1993 with the name &quot;Super Power&quot;, it was the first independent video game magazine in Sweden. Despite its independence, it initially only covered Nintendo games, but the coverage was extended to all major consoles in 1995. The name was changed in March 1996, and in June 2001 the magazine started covering PC games. Its monthly circulation was in 2003 25,000. The editor in chief until November 2004 was Tobias Bjarneby, who left along with a large segment of the staff to form the new magazine &quot;Reset&quot; (which later merged with the magazine Player 1 to form &quot;LEVEL&quot;). The last editor in chief was Joakim Bennet, who succeeded Tommy Rydling in mid-2007.

On 17 August 2009, Joakim Bennet announced that the magazine would be disestablished within the near future. The last issue was released in October 2009. The last issue was dedicated to earlier versions of the magazine, which almost the entire magazine, including a behind-the-scenes and quotes from various numbers from all years. Also was an exclusive script describing the change from Super POWER to Super PLAY, which apparently was supposed to be called simply &quot;Play&quot;, and the reviews all having the same layout from previous versions of the magazine, in addition to comments from the readers and exact same ads as previous versions, obviously outdated by then. Notoriously, the review of the PlayStation 3 game &quot;Uncharted 2: Among Thieves&quot; was the only one based on the layout used 1996-99 and had a yellow stripe, which was the color used by reviews on games from the original PlayStation.

==Trivia==
* Patrick Söderlund, now the CEO of Embark Studios wrote for the magazine in the mid-1990s.
* A copy of Super PLAY can be found in the game &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;.
* Super PLAY was originally called Super POWER.

<text>Ell Pond is a kettle hole in Hopkinton, Washington County, Rhode Island. It is surrounded by a swamp of red maple and Atlantic white cypress, and by steep granitic monadnocks. The small area contains communities of both hydrophytic and xeric plants, which makes it ideal for ecological research and education. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in May 1974. In 1972, The Nature Conservancy purchased including the pond to extend of protected land owned by the Audubon Society of Rhode Island and the of Rockville Wildlife Management Area owned by the state. The preserve is jointly managed by all three entities. There are hiking trails in the preserve, but Ell pond is specifically not reachable due to its fragile environment.

As of 2025, Ell Pond is the only listed National Natural Landmark in Rhode Island.

<text>Swansea Bay () is a bay on the southern coast of Wales. The River Neath, River Tawe, River Afan, River Kenfig and Clyne River flow into the bay. Swansea Bay and the upper reaches of the Bristol Channel experience a large tidal range. The shipping ports in Swansea Bay are Swansea Docks, Port Talbot Docks and Briton Ferry wharves.

Each stretch of beach within the bay has its own name:
* Aberavon Beach
* Baglan Bay
* Jersey Marine Beach
* Swansea Beach
* Mumbles Beach

== Oyster trade ==
Oyster fishing was once an important industry in Swansea Bay, employing 600 people at its height in the 1860s. However, overfishing, disease and pollution had all but wiped out the oyster population by 1920. In 2005, plans were announced to reintroduce the Oyster farming industry.

==Pollution==
For the last two decades of the 20th century, the bay was blighted by pollution, partly from the surrounding heavy industry and partly from sewerage outlets being sited at inappropriate locations including the main one that was located just seaward of Mumbles Lighthouse. A pumping station inside the cliff adjacent to Knab Rock brought all of Swansea city&#x27;s effluent in a raw form to this point. Adding to the problem was the natural current flow of the waters in the Bay which often did not move the polluted waters further out to sea. Ironically, the outgoing tide did not carry the raw sewage &quot;down&quot; the adjacent Bristol Channel, but instead cause it to be sucked &quot;in&quot; around the circumference of the Bay and only then out down the Channel. If not fully discharged on that tide, the incoming tide would then push the same effluent up the Channel, and once again circulate around the Bay. Efforts were made by the local authority to reduce the pollution in the Bay but care had to be taken to ensure the pollution did not move to the popular beach resorts in south Gower instead.

This original sewer outlet was finally made inactive in around 1996 following the construction of a pipeline which ran all the way back around the Bay following the line of the former Mumbles Railway as far as Beach Street, along the sea-side of the Maritime Quarter and through Swansea Docks to a new £90 million sewage treatment plant at Crymlyn Burrows near Port Tennant. From here a new outlet was made, extending further out to sea. As a consequence of the improvement these works have made, it is hoped that Swansea Bay will achieve Blue Flag Beach status. Aberavon beach was awarded Blue Flag status in December 2007.

==Power generation==

===Fossil===
There is a GE-built gas-fired power station just inland at Baglan Bay. A second gas-fired power station, the &quot;Abernedd Power Station&quot; at Port Talbot, was approved for construction in 2011.

===Biomass plans===
A new biomass power station was approved in 2014 for construction near the coast at Port Talbot.

===Tidal plans===

Swansea Bay (along with the rest of the Bristol Channel) has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world. This offers a potential for electricity generation using tidal lagoons. Around 2015, a proposal was made by Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay Ltd for a tidal lagoon. The tidal lagoon would be sited just south of the Queen&#x27;s Dock between River Tawe and River Neath estuaries. This project was controversial, partly due to the amount of subsidy required to make the project viable and also because of the potential damage to an AONB and MCZ in Cornwall where Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay sought to re-open a disused quarry at Dean Point from which to source the rock for the lagoon.

===Wind plans===
Construction of an offshore windfarm in the Bay was approved in 2004, but construction was deferred owing to the costs involved. The windfarm was to have been sited at Scarweather Sands, about off the coast and visible from Porthcawl.

<doc id="634965" wikidata="Q275934" url="?curid=634965" title="Tokusatsu">
<text>is a Japanese term for live-action films or television programs that make heavy use of practical special effects. Credited to special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya, &quot;tokusatsu&quot; mainly refers to science fiction, war, fantasy, or horror media featuring such technology but is also occasionally dubbed a genre itself. Its contemporary use originated in the Japanese mass media around 1958 to explain special effects in an easy-to-understand manner and was popularized during the &quot;first monster boom&quot; (1966–1968). Prior to the monster boom, it was known in Japan as or shortened .

Subgenres of include &quot;kaiju&quot; such as the &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Gamera&quot; series; superhero such as the &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; and &quot;Metal Hero&quot; series; &quot;Kyodai&quot; Hero like &quot;Ultraman, and Denkou Choujin Gridman;&quot; and mecha like &quot;Giant Robo&quot; and &quot;Super Robot Red Baron&quot;. Some television programs combine several of these subgenres, for example, the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series.

&quot;Tokusatsu&quot; is one of the most popular forms of Japanese entertainment, but only a small proportion of &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films and television programs are widely known outside of Japan. Nevertheless, certain properties have attained popularity outside of Japan; &quot;Godzilla&quot; featured in popular American-made movies.

==History==

=== 1908–1933: Early development ===
 has origins in early Japanese theater, specifically in kabuki (with its action and fight scenes) and in , which utilized some of the earliest forms of special effects, specifically puppetry. Japanese cinema pioneer Shōzō Makino is credited as the founding father of &quot;tokusatsu&quot; techniques, having directed several &quot;jidaigeki&quot; films starring Matsunosuke Onoe that featured special effects. Makino&#x27;s effects work inspired filmmaker Yoshirō Edamasa to employ such technology in his own movies, notably &quot;Journey to the West&quot; (1917) and &quot;The Great Buddha Arrival&quot; (1934).

=== 1933–1945: Influence from &quot;King Kong&quot; and wartime efforts ===
After researching the special effects featured in &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), Eiji Tsuburaya began to develop &quot;tokusatsu&quot; and had his breakthrough on &quot;Princess Kaguya&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Daughter of the Samurai&quot; (1937). Modern , however, did not begin to take shape until the late 1940s.

=== 1954–present: Widespread recognition ===
Tsuburaya and the director Ishirō Honda became the driving forces behind 1954&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot;. Tsuburaya, inspired by the American film &quot;King Kong&quot;, formulated many of the techniques that would become staples of the genre, such as so-called suitmation—the use of a human actor in a costume to play a giant monster—combined with the use of miniatures and scaled-down city sets. &quot;Godzilla&quot; forever changed the landscape of Japanese science fiction, fantasy, and cinema by creating a uniquely Japanese vision in a genre typically dominated by American cinema. This film also helped Tsuburaya&#x27;s employer Toho establish itself as the most successful effects company in the world.

&quot;Godzilla&quot; kickstarted the genre in Japan, creating the &quot;Monster Boom&quot;, which remained extremely popular for several decades, with characters such as the aforementioned Godzilla, Gamera and King Ghidorah leading the market. However, in 1957 Shintoho produced the first film serial featuring the superhero character Super Giant, signaling a shift in popularity that favored masked heroes over giant monsters called the &quot;Henshin Boom&quot; started by Kamen Rider in 1971, though giant monsters, aliens and humanoid creatures dubbed remained an integral part of the genre. Along with the anime &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, the &quot;Super Giant&quot; serials had a profound effect on the world of . The following year, &quot;Moonlight Mask&quot; premiered, the first of numerous televised superhero dramas that would make up one of the most popular subgenres. Created by Kōhan Kawauchi, he followed up its success with the superhero shows &quot;Seven Color Mask&quot; (1959) and &quot;Messenger of Allah&quot; (1960), both starring a young Sonny Chiba.

These original productions preceded the first color-television series, &quot;Ambassador Magma&quot; and &quot;Ultraman&quot;, which heralded the Kyodai Hero subgenre, wherein a regular-sized protagonist grows to larger proportions to fight equally large monsters. Popular superhero shows in the 1970s included &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; (1971), &quot;Warrior of Love Rainbowman&quot; (1972), &quot;Super Sentai&quot; (1975, trademarked in 1979) and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1978).

==Techniques==
===Miniatures===

&quot;Tokusatsu&quot; is recognized for its heavy use of miniature sets, especially in the Kyodai Hero subgenre. Miniatures are placed from the camera&#x27;s perspective to create the illusion that the characters are larger than they are.

===Suitmation===
 is the term used to describe the process in movies and television programs used to portray a monster using suit acting. The exact origin of the term remains unknown. At the least, it was used to promote the Godzilla suit from &quot;The Return of Godzilla&quot;.

==Franchises and productions==

The many productions of series have general themes common throughout different groups.

===&quot;Kaiju&quot;===
 productions primarily feature monsters, or . Such series include &quot;Ultraman&quot;, the &quot;Godzilla&quot; film series, the &quot;Gamera&quot; series, the &quot;Daimajin&quot; series, and films such as &quot;Mothra&quot;, &quot;The War of the Gargantuas&quot;, and .
 productions primarily feature supervillains as their central character. This includes films such as &quot;The Invisible Avenger&quot;, &quot;Half Human&quot;, &quot;The H-Man&quot;, &quot;The Secret of the Telegian&quot;, and &quot;The Human Vapor&quot;.

===Popular franchises===

Since about 1960, several long-running television series have combined various other themes. Tsuburaya Productions has had the &quot;Ultraman Series&quot; starting with &quot;Ultra Q&quot; and &quot;Ultraman&quot; in 1966. P Productions began their foray into in 1966 with the series &quot;Ambassador Magma&quot;. They also had involvement in the &quot;Lion-Maru&quot; series which concluded in November 2006.

Toei Company has several series that fall under their &quot;Toei Superheroes&quot; category of programming, starting in 1958 with the film series, &quot;Moonlight Mask&quot;. Then, they produced several other long-running series, starting with Shotaro Ishinomori&#x27;s &quot;Kamen Rider Series&quot; in 1971, the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series in 1975, the &quot;Metal Hero Series&quot; in 1982, and the &quot;Toei Fushigi Comedy Series&quot; in 1981. Toei also produced several other television series based on Ishinomori&#x27;s works, including &quot;Android Kikaider&quot; and &quot;Kikaider 01&quot;, &quot;Robot Detective&quot;, &quot;Inazuman&quot; and &quot;Inazuman Flash&quot;, and &quot;Kaiketsu Zubat&quot;. Toei was also involved in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; television series, which influenced their subsequent Super Sentai series. In 2003, TV Asahi began broadcasting the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; and &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; series in a one-hour block airing each week known as &quot;Super Hero Time&quot;. Toho, the creators of Godzilla, also had their hands in creating the &quot;Chouseishin Series&quot; of programs from 2003 to 2006 and the &quot;Zone Fighter&quot; franchise.

In 2006, Keita Amemiya&#x27;s &quot;Garo&quot;, a mature late-night tokusatsu drama, was released, starting a franchise composed of several television series and films. Other mature late-night series followed, including a revival of &quot;Lion-Maru&quot; in &quot;Lion-Maru G&quot;, the &quot;Daimajin Kanon&quot; television series (based on the &quot;Daimajin&quot; film series), and &quot;Shougeki Gouraigan!!&quot; (also created by Amemiya).

=== movies===
Various movies classified as can include disaster movies and science fiction films. These include (1956), , , , , , , , , and .

==Similar productions==
===Non-traditional productions===
Non-traditional films and television programs may not use conventional special effects or may not star human actors. Though suitmation typifies , some productions may use stop-motion to animate their monsters instead, for example &quot;Majin Hunter Mitsurugi&quot; in 1973. TV shows may use traditional techniques, but are cast with puppets or marionettes: &quot;Uchuusen Silica&quot; (1960); &quot;Ginga Shonen Tai&quot; (1963); &quot;Kuchuu Toshi 008&quot; (1969); and Go Nagai&#x27;s &quot;X Bomber&quot; (1980). Some may employ animation in addition to its live-action components: Tsuburaya Productions&#x27; &quot;Dinosaur Expedition Team Bornfree&quot; (1976), &quot;Dinosaur War Izenborg&quot; (1977) and &quot;Pro-Wrestling Star Aztekaiser&quot; (1976).

===Japanese fan films===
As the popularity of increased in Japan, several fan film projects have been produced over the years. Hideaki Anno, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Takami Akai, and Shinji Higuchi set up a fan-based group called Daicon Film, which they renamed Gainax in 1985 and turned into an animation studio. Besides anime sequences, they also produced a series of shorts parodying monster movies and superhero shows. These productions include &quot;Swift Hero Noutenki&quot; (1982), &quot;Patriotic Squadron Dai-Nippon&quot; (1983), &quot;Return of Ultraman&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Eight-Headed Giant Serpent Strikes Back&quot; (1985).

==Outside of Japan==

 techniques have spread outside Japan due to the popularity of &quot;Godzilla&quot; films.

===Adaptations===
&quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot; first appeared in English in 1956. Rather than a simple dub of the Japanese-language original, this work represented an entirely re-edited version that restructured the plot to incorporate a new character played by a native English-speaking actor, Raymond Burr. &quot;Ultraman&quot; gained popularity when United Artists dubbed it for American audiences in the 1960s.

In 2002, 4Kids Entertainment bought the rights to &quot;Ultraman Tiga&quot;, but simply produced a dub of the Japanese footage, broadcast on the FoxBox. And in 2009, Adness Entertainment took 2002&#x27;s &quot;Kamen Rider Ryuki&quot; and turned it into &quot;Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight&quot;, which began broadcast on The CW4Kids in 2009. It won the first Daytime Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Stunt Coordination&quot; for its original scenes.

In 2023, GMA Network released Voltes V: Legacy, an adaptation of the original Voltes V, which has used special effects and CGI heavily reminiscent of those found in traditional tokusatsu shows, with some western influences added. In 2006, YTV Monster Warriors used CGI for the monsters with humor in the show.

===Original productions===
In 1961, England-based filmmakers produced the Godzilla-style film, &quot;Gorgo&quot;, which used the same situation technique as the Godzilla films. That same year, Saga Studios in Denmark made another Godzilla-style giant monster film, &quot;Reptilicus&quot;, bringing its monster to life using a marionette on a miniature set. In 1967, South Korea produced its monster movie titled &quot;Yonggary&quot;. In 1975, Shaw Brothers produced a superhero film called &quot;The Super Inframan&quot;, based on the huge success of Ultraman and Kamen Rider there. The film starred Danny Lee in the title role. Although there were several similar superhero productions in Hong Kong, &quot;The Super Inframan&quot; came first. With help from Japanese special effects artists under Sadamasa Arikawa, they also produced a Japanese-styled monster movie, &quot;The Mighty Peking Man&quot;, in 1977.

Concurrent with their work on &quot;Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad&quot;, DIC attempted an original concept based on the popularity of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills&quot;. In 1998, a video from an attempted &quot;Power Rangers&quot;-styled adaptation of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; surfaced, combining original footage of American actresses with original animated sequences.

Saban also attempted to make their own unique series entitled &quot;Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog&quot;, set in medieval Ireland and featured four, later five knights who transform using the power of the elements (for the most part) at they protected their kingdom from evil. Saban had also produced the live-action &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; series &quot;Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation&quot;, which was known in the turtles&#x27; fandom for introducing a female turtle exclusive to that series called &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; and eliminating the fact that the other turtles were brothers. The show mostly featured actors in costumes, but featured similar choreographed fights like other shows.

Also, like other Tokusatsu Productions, the Syndicated Big Wolf on Campus and Nickelodeon&#x27;s Animorphs are also described as &quot;American Tokusatsu&quot; due to the techniques they employed. Fujiyama Ichiban is a 2013 web series shot in Los Angeles.

All the other Tokusatsu shows in YTV&#x27;s Monster Warriors were shot in Barrie, Ontario, Canada. They used CGI for the monsters.

In the 2000s, production companies in other East Asian countries began producing their own original -inspired television series: Thailand&#x27;s &quot;Sport Ranger&quot; and South Korea&#x27;s &quot;Erexion&quot; in 2006; the Philippines&#x27; &quot;&quot; (itself a sanctioned spinoff of Toei&#x27;s &quot;Space Sheriff Shaider&quot;) in 2007; China&#x27;s &quot;Armor Hero&quot; () in 2008, &quot;Battle Strike Team: Giant Saver&quot; () in 2012, &quot;Metal Kaiser&quot; (); and Indonesia&#x27;s &quot;Bima Satria Garuda&quot; which began in 2013.

On July the 1st, 2019, Vietnam&#x27;s Transform Studio co-operating with Dive Into Eden announced their own original series, &quot;Mighty Guardian&quot; (Vietnamese: ). The first season in the series is &quot;Mighty Guardian: Lost Avian&quot; (Vietnamese: ), using Vietnamese Mythologies as the main concept.

===Influence===
Kaiju and films, notably &quot;Warning from Space&quot; (1956), sparked Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s interest in science fiction films and influenced &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). According to his biographer John Baxter, despite their &quot;clumsy model sequences, the films were often well-photographed in colour ... and their dismal dialogue was delivered in well-designed and well-lit sets.&quot;

Steven Spielberg cited &quot;Godzilla&quot; as an inspiration for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993), specifically &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot; (1956), which he grew up watching. During its production, Spielberg described &quot;Godzilla&quot; as &quot;the most masterful of all the dinosaur movies because it made you believe it was really happening.&quot; &quot;Godzilla&quot; also influenced the Spielberg film &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975).

Japanese movies also influenced one of the first video games, &quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1961), inspiring its science fiction theme. According to the game&#x27;s programmer Martin Graetz, &quot;we would be off to one of Boston&#x27;s seedier cinemas to view the latest trash from Toho&quot; as Japanese studios &quot;churned out a steady diet of cinematic junk food of which Rodan and Godzilla are only the best-known examples.&quot;

In 1998, a Brazilian webcomic inspired by both &quot;Power Rangers&quot; and &quot;Super Sentai&quot; entitled &quot;Combo Rangers&quot; was published on the Internet, created by Japanese-Brazilian author Fábio Yabu. The webcomic&#x27;s popularity allowed the webcomic to become a print comic book until 2004 and having a reboot through Graphic Novels in the 2010s.

In 2001, Buki X-1 Productions, a French fan-based production company, produced its own series, &quot;Jushi Sentai France Five&quot; (now called &quot;Shin Kenjushi France Five&quot;), a tribute to Toei&#x27;s long running &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series. The low-budget television series &quot;Kaiju Big Battel&quot; directly parodies monster and Kyodai Hero films and series by immersing their own costumed characters in professional wrestling matches among cardboard buildings. In 2006, &quot;Mighty Moshin&#x27; Emo Rangers&quot; premiered on the Internet as a &quot;Power Rangers&quot; spoof, but was quickly picked up by MTV UK for broadcast. The popularity of tokusatsus in Brazil in the 90s provided many fans in the country who even tried to make indie series, the most notable being &quot;Insector Sun&quot; (a low-budget tribute to &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;) and &quot;TimerMan&quot;.

Peyton Reed, the director of the &quot;Ant-Man&quot; films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, said that Ant-Man&#x27;s costume design was influenced by two superheroes, Ultraman and Inframan.

In 2015, Brazilian indie game studio, Behold Studios, developed a &quot;Power Ranger&quot; and &quot;Super Sentai&quot; inspired game, &quot;Chroma Squad&quot;.

Tokusatsu has also had a large influence on western animation. Artist Thomas Perkins has delved into work that makes reference to tokusatsu. This is most notable in the design of the character Way Big from &quot;Ben 10&quot;, who bears a striking resemblance to Ultraman.

In March 2024, Oxford English Dictionary included the word Tokusatsu as a loanword along with others from Japanese culture.

<text>Carmarthen Bay () is an inlet of the South Wales coast, including notable beaches such as Pendine Sands and Cefn Sidan sands. Carmarthen Bay is partially within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee list Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries as a Special Area of Conservation.

==Geography==
The River Loughor flows into the bay at the Burry estuary, and the rivers Tywi, Taf and Gwendraeth flow into the bay at the Three Rivers Estuary. Caldey Island lies in the bay near Tenby. The northwestern corner of the bay is separately named as Saundersfoot Bay. Towns and villages in the bay include, from east to west: Llanelli, Burry Port (&quot;Porth Tywyn&quot;), Pembrey (&quot;Penbre&quot;), Kidwelly (&quot;Cydweli&quot;), Ferryside (&quot;Glanyfferi&quot;), Llansteffan, Laugharne (&quot;Talacharn&quot;), Pendine (&quot;Pentywyn&quot;), Amroth, Wisemans Bridge (&quot;Pont-yr-ŵrddoeth&quot;), Saundersfoot and Tenby (&quot;Dinbych y Pysgod&quot;). There are fine beaches at Pendine Sands, Cefn Sidan, Laugharne, Llansteffan and Ferryside.
==Biodiversity==
The Joint Nature Conservation Committee list Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries as a Special Area of Conservation. This is a public body that advises the Welsh Government on international nature conservation. The area conserved includes sea inlets, tidal rivers, estuaries, mud flats, sand flats, lagoons (including saltwork basins), salt marshes, salt pastures, salt steppes, shingle, sea cliffs and islets. The sand and mud flats have large numbers of bivalve molluscs including the edible cockle. The large shallow inlets and bays provide habitat for a great variety of marine invertebrates. The saltmarshes have biodiverse communities of glasswort (&quot;Salicornis&quot; species), dwarf eelgrass (&quot;Zostera noltei&quot;), sea rush (&quot;Juncus maritimus&quot;) and marsh-mallow (&quot;Althaea officinalis&quot;) and all the wildlife they support. A primary reason for the listing is the presence in the bay of the twait shad (&quot;Alosa fallax&quot;), a migratory fish.

==Wind turbine testing in the 1980s== 
An area of the Carmarthen Bay coastline near Burry Port was used in the 1980s to test wind turbines. The first turbine to be installed in the area was switched on in November 1982. Five turbines of different designs were tested at the site, installed between 1982 and 1989. The project was concluded in the late 1990s, the turbines were removed, and the land was eventually integrated into the Millennium Coastal Park.

<text>Otis Burt &quot;Sonny&quot; Shroyer Jr. (born August 28, 1935) is an American actor who has appeared in various television and film roles. He is best known for his role as Deputy Sheriff Enos Strate in the television series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. He also starred in the short-lived spin-off series &quot;Enos&quot; based around his &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; character.

==Biography==
Shroyer was born in the town of Valdosta, Georgia. He attended Florida State University on a football scholarship, but his career was cut short by an injury. He finished his degree at the University of Georgia.

He began a career as a professional model in 1961. His first screen role came in the 1972 film &quot;Payday&quot;. Shroyer almost became typecast as a bad guy before landing the role of the naive Deputy Enos Strate in the hit pop culture series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; in 1978 (first broadcast early 1979).

&quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; role was Shroyer&#x27;s most visible. His character was written out at the start of the third season to be given a spinoff series titled &quot;Enos&quot; in 1980. The new show was not a success and was canceled after eighteen episodes. Shroyer returned to &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; at the start of the fifth season in 1982 and remained with the series until it ended in 1985. Shroyer also released a children&#x27;s album in 1982. The album was called &quot;Back in Hazzard&quot; and featured a cover of Roger Miller&#x27;s classic, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Rollerskate In a Buffalo Herd&quot;. He also recorded a song &quot;Children in Need&quot; with fellow actor Randall Franks for Franks&#x27;s 2001 CD &quot;God&#x27;s Children&quot;. He and Franks have made personal appearances together.

Shroyer remained active until he retired in 2023 due to COVID-related issues. He portrayed University of Alabama coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, Delbert Birdsong in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, and Governor Jimmie Davis in &quot;Ray&quot;. He is also a country and gospel singer.

Shroyer is married and has two sons.

<text>Abergwili () is a village and community in Carmarthenshire, Wales, near the confluence of the rivers Towy and Gwili, close to the town of Carmarthen. It is also an electoral ward. Named after the village of Abergwili, the community includes the settlements of Peniel, Llanfihangel-uwch-Gwili and White Mill. The grounds of the former Bishop&#x27;s Palace are listed on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

== Bishop&#x27;s Palace ==
The village is known for its Bishop&#x27;s Palace, home to the Bishop of St David&#x27;s since 1542, when Bishop William Barlow transferred his palace from St David&#x27;s to Abergwili, re-using the premises of an older college of priests. The building is believed to have been built between 1283 and 1291, when Thomas Bek was made bishop of St Davids. It was known as a college until it was amalgamated with another to create Christ College in Brecon. It was almost completely rebuilt in 1903 following a disastrous fire. It contains the chapel originally added by Archbishop Laud in 1625, when he was Bishop of St David&#x27;s. In 1974 the old episcopal palace was purchased by Carmarthenshire County Council for use as a museum, whilst a new residence for the bishops, &quot;Llys Esgob&quot;, was built in part of the grounds, together with Diocesan Offices - thereby continuing a connection with Abergwili which has now lasted for well over 400 years.

Until 1802 the river Towy ran past the back of the Palace; it changed course and left an oxbow lake. Today it is a large lily pond with large amounts of wildlife. The park is registered at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

== Amenities ==
Abergwili has seen a substantial increase in population in recent years with new property developments but has kept its character and rural tranquility. The Celtic cross war memorial was built in memory of those from the village who died in the two world wars. Abergwili has a bilingual primary school in the centre.

The village is home to the Carmarthen Quins rugby union team. Merlin&#x27;s Hill Centre is a farm which has been opened up to the public. Merlin&#x27;s Hill is next to the farm. There is a footpath that goes to the top of the hill, which is the site of an Iron Age hillfort. Merlin&#x27;s Hill is down in local legend as the final resting place of Merlin from the Arthurian legend. The &quot;Wheat Sheaf&quot; pub in the village is one of the oldest pubs in Carmarthenshire. Around 1850 there was also a pub called the &quot;Albion Inn&quot;.

It has a hospital, Glangwili General Hospital, and heritage railway, Gwili Railway. It once had a railway station.

==Religious history==
There are two places of Christian worship in the village of Abergwili: Ebeneser Chapel, a Welsh Nonconformist Independent Chapel, and St David&#x27;s, a Church in Wales parish church. St David&#x27;s was rebuilt in the early 1840s when the Rev. Joshua Hughes was vicar, on the foundations of a much earlier church. The new church was consecrated in 1843. The cost was £1,400, and Hughes was later to become Bishop of St Asaph. Richard Davies was buried at this church.

The parish of Abergwili also includes a number of other places of worship, including the church at Llanfihangel uwch Gwiliand the Independent (Congregationalist) chapel at Peniel.

==Local government==
Abergwili is an electoral ward for the purposes of elections to Carmarthenshire County Council. From 1995 until 2017, the ward was represented by Independent councillor Pam Palmer. Abergwili also has a community council. It was won by Plaid Cymru candidate Dorian Williams in 2017, who was succeeded by Neil Lewis in 2022.

The community is bordered by the communities of: Llanllawddog; Llanegwad; Llanarthney; Llangunnor; Carmarthen; and Bronwydd, all being in Carmarthenshire.

<doc id="634987" wikidata="Q288255" url="?curid=634987" title="James B. Pritchard">
<text>James Bennett Pritchard (October 4, 1909 – January 1, 1997) was an American archeologist whose work explicated the interrelationships of the religions of ancient Palestine, Canaan, Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon. Pritchard was honored with the Gold Medal Award for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement in 1983 from the Archaeological Institute of America.

He had a long association with the University of Pennsylvania, where he was professor of religious thought and the first curator of Biblical archaeology at the University Museum. Pritchard&#x27;s strength lay in setting the Bible within its broader cultural contexts in the Ancient Near East. Pritchard was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1973. In 1977 Pritchard received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of 
Theology at Uppsala University, Sweden.

Pritchard authored the book &quot;Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament&quot;, which was released in three editions (1950, 1955, 1969), universally referred to as &quot;ANET&quot;, which provided reliable translations of texts that threw light on the context of Ancient Near Eastern history and the Hebrew Bible.

==Early life and education==
Pritchard was born in Louisville, Kentucky; he graduated from Asbury College in 1930, and earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania (1942).

==Career==
Pritchard&#x27;s archaeological reputation began to be established by his excavations at a site called el-Jib (1956–1962). He identified it as Gibeon by inscriptions on the Al Jib jar handles. He cataloged these in &quot;Hebrew Inscriptions and Stamps From Gibeon&quot; (1959), which included the first in-depth discussion of concentric-circle incisions on jar handles associated with LMLK seals. He explained the significance of his finds for a general audience in &quot;Gibeon: Where the Sun Stood Still&quot; (1962).

He followed (1964–1967) with excavations at Tell es-Sa&#x27;idiyeh, on the east bank in the Jordan Valley, Jordan, which revealed itself as a meeting place for disparate cultures during the transition in the late Bronze Age to the use of iron, which he connected to the influence of the Sea Peoples (&quot;New evidence on the role of the Sea Peoples in Canaan at the Beginning of the Iron Age&quot;), in &quot;The Role of the Phoenicians&quot;, 1968. His work was cut short by the 1967 Six-Day War.

His third and last major excavation at Sarafand, Lebanon (1969–1974) revealed the ancient Phoenician city of Sarepta. It was the first time a major Phoenician city situated in the Phoenician heartland had been fully excavated. His first findings were published in 1975: he described pottery workshops and kilns, artifacts of daily use and religious figurines, a shrine, numerous inscriptions that included some in Ugaritic, and a seal with the city&#x27;s name that made the identification secure. His article, &quot;Sarepta in history and tradition&quot; in &quot;Understanding the Sacred Texts&quot; (1972) displays his characteristic research. His book &quot;Recovering Sarepta, an Ancient Phoenician City&quot; (1978) was written for general readers. In 1975 he published with Baruch A. Levine &quot;The Israelites&quot;, the 18th book in the Time-Life 20 vol. series &quot;The Emergence of Man&quot;. 

Additional works included &quot;Archaeology and the Old Testament&quot; (1958), which traced the evolution of modern approaches to archaeology from the first excavations in the Holy Land; and &quot;Solomon and Sheba&quot; (1974), which separated fact from legend.

Prior to his tenured appointment to the University of Pennsylvania, Pritchard taught at Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, 1942–1954, as the chair of Old Testament History and Exegesis. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote an essay about the prophet Jeremiah for his course on the Old Testament. He also taught at the Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, California (1954–1962).

An appreciation of James B. Pritchard appeared in the &quot;American Journal of Archaeology&quot;, Volume 102, Number 1 (January 1998, pages 175–177).

<text>Mass comparison is a method developed by Joseph Greenberg to determine the level of genetic relatedness between languages. It is now usually called multilateral comparison. Mass comparison has been referred to as a &quot;methodological deception&quot; and is rejected by most linguists, and its continued use is primarily restricted to fringe linguistics.

Some of the top-level relationships Greenberg named are now generally accepted thanks to analysis with other, more widely accepted linguistic techniques, though they had already been posited by others (e.g. Afro-Asiatic and Niger–Congo). Others are accepted by many though disputed by some prominent specialists (e.g. Nilo-Saharan), while others are almost universally rejected (e.g. Eurasiatic, Khoisan and Amerind).

== Methodology ==

The idea of mass comparison method is that a group of languages is related when they show numerous resemblances in vocabulary, including pronouns, and morphemes, forming an interlocking pattern common to the group. Unlike the comparative method, mass comparison does not require any regular or systematic correspondences between the languages compared; all that is required is an impressionistic feeling of similarity. Greenberg does not establish a clear standard for determining relatedness; he does not set a standard for what he considers a &quot;resemblance&quot; or how many resemblances are needed to prove relationship.

Mass comparison is done by setting up a table of basic vocabulary items and their forms in the languages to be compared for resemblances. The table can also include common morphemes. The following table was used by to illustrate the technique. It shows the forms of six items of basic vocabulary in nine different languages, identified by letters.

According to Greenberg, basic relationships can be determined without any experience in the case of languages that are fairly closely related, though knowledge of probable paths of sound change acquired through typology allows one to go farther faster. For instance, the path &quot;p&quot; &gt; &quot;f&quot; is extremely frequent, but the path &quot;f&quot; &gt; &quot;p&quot; is much less so, enabling one to hypothesize that &quot;fi&quot; : &quot;pi&quot; and &quot;fik&quot; : &quot;pix&quot; are indeed related and go back to protoform *&quot;pi&quot; and *&quot;pik/x&quot;. Similarly, while knowledge that &quot;k&quot; &gt; &quot;x&quot; is extremely frequent, &quot;x&quot; &gt; &quot;k&quot; is much less so enables one to choose *&quot;pik&quot; over *&quot;pix&quot;. Thus, according to Greenberg (2005:318), phonological considerations come into play from the very beginning, even though mass comparison does not attempt to produce reconstructions of protolanguages as these belong to a later phase of study. The tables used in actual mass comparison involve much larger numbers of items and languages. The items included may be either lexical, such as &#x27;hand&#x27;, &#x27;sky&#x27;, and &#x27;go&#x27;, or morphological, such as PLURAL and MASCULINE. For Greenberg, the results achieved through mass comparison approached certainty: &quot;The presence of fundamental vocabulary resemblances and resemblances in items with grammatical function, particularly if recurrent through a number of languages, is a sure indication of genetic relationship.&quot;

== Relation to the comparative method ==

As a tool for identifying genetic relationships between languages, mass comparison is an alternative to the comparative method. Proponents of mass comparison, such as Greenberg, claim that the comparative method is unnecessary to identify genetic relationships; furthermore, they claim that it can only be used once relationships are identified using mass comparison, making mass comparison the &quot;first step&quot; in determining relationships (1957:44). This contrasts with mainstream comparative linguistics, which relies on the comparative method to aid in identifying genetic relationships; specifically, it involves comparing data from two or more languages. If sets of recurrent sound correspondences are found, the languages are most likely related; if further investigation confirms the potential relationship, reconstructed ancestral forms can be set up using the collated sound correspondences.

However, Greenberg did not entirely disavow the comparative method; he stated that &quot;once we have a well-established stock I go about comparing and reconstructing just like anyone else, as can be seen in my various contributions to historical linguistics&quot; (1990, quoted in Ruhlen 1994:285) and accused mainstream linguists of spreading &quot;the strange and widely disseminated notion that I seek to replace the comparative method with a new and strange invention of my own&quot; (2002:2). Earlier in his career, before he fully developed mass comparison, he even stated that his methodology did not &quot;conflict in any fashion with the traditional comparative method&quot; (1957:44). However, Greenberg sees the comparative method as playing no role in determining relationships, significantly reducing its importance compared to traditional methods of linguistic comparison. In effect, his approach of mass comparison sidelined the comparative method with a &quot;new and strange invention of his own&quot;.

Reflecting the methodological empiricism also present in his typological work, he viewed facts as of greater weight than their interpretations, stating (1957:45):

:[R]econstruction of an original sound system has the status of an explanatory theory to account for etymologies already strong on other grounds. Between the *&quot;vaida&quot; of Bopp and the *&quot;γwoidxe&quot; of Sturtevant lie more than a hundred years of the intensive development of Indo-European phonological reconstruction. What has remained constant has been the validity of the etymologic relationship among Sanskrit &quot;veda&quot;, Greek &quot;woida&quot;, Gothic &quot;wita&quot;, all meaning &quot;I know&quot;, and many other unshakable etymologies both of root and of non-root morphemes recognized at the outset. And who will be bold enough to conjecture from what original the Indo-Europeanist one hundred years from now will derive these same forms?

== Criticism ==

=== Errors in application ===
The presence of frequent errors in Greenberg&#x27;s data has been pointed out by linguists such as Lyle Campbell and Alexander Vovin, who see it as fatally undermining Greenberg&#x27;s attempt to demonstrate the reliability of mass comparison. Campbell notes in his discussion of Greenberg&#x27;s Amerind proposal that &quot;nearly every specialist finds extensive distortions and inaccuracies in Greenberg&#x27;s data&quot;; for example, Willem Adelaar, a specialist in Andean languages, has stated that &quot;the number of erroneous forms [in Greenberg&#x27;s data] probably exceeds that of the correct forms&quot;. Some forms in Greenberg&#x27;s data even appear to be attributed to the wrong language. Greenberg also neglects known sound changes that languages have undergone; once these are taken into account, many of the resemblances he points out vanish. Greenberg&#x27;s data also contains errors of a more systematic sort: for instance, he groups unrelated languages together based on outdated classifications or because they have similar names.

Greenberg also arbitrarily deems certain portions of a word to be affixes when affixes of the requisite phonological shape are unknown to make words cohere better with his data. Conversely, Greenberg frequently employs affixed forms in his data, failing to recognise actual morphemic boundaries; when affixes are removed, the words often no longer bear any resemblance to his &quot;Amerind&quot; reconstructions. Greenberg has responded to this criticism by claiming that &quot;the method of multilateral comparison is so powerful that it will give reliable results even with the poorest data. Incorrect material should merely have a randomizing effect”. This has hardly reassured critics of the method, who are far from convincing of the method&#x27;s &quot;power&quot;.

=== Borrowing ===

A prominent criticism of mass comparison is that it cannot distinguish borrowed forms from inherited ones, unlike comparative reconstruction, which is able to do so through regular sound correspondences. Undetected borrowings within Greenberg&#x27;s data support this claim; for instance, he lists &quot;cognates&quot; of Uwa &quot;baxita&quot; &quot;machete&quot;, even though it is a borrowing from Spanish . admits that &quot;in particular and infrequent instances the question of borrowing may be doubtful&quot; when using mass comparison, but claims that basic vocabulary is unlikely to be borrowed compared to cultural vocabulary, stating that &quot;where a mass of resemblances is due to borrowing, they will tend to appear in cultural vocabulary and to cluster in certain semantic areas which reflect the cultural nature of the contact.&quot; Mainstream linguists accept this premise, but claim that it does not suffice for distinguishing borrowings from inherited vocabulary.

According to him, any type of linguistic item may be borrowed &quot;on occasion&quot;, but &quot;fundamental vocabulary is proof against mass borrowing&quot;. However, languages can and do borrow basic vocabulary. For instance, in the words of Campbell, Finnish has borrowed &quot;from its Baltic and Germanic neighbors various terms for basic kinship and body parts, including &#x27;mother&#x27;, &#x27;daughter&#x27;, &#x27;sister&#x27;, &#x27;tooth&#x27;, &#x27;navel&#x27;, &#x27;neck&#x27;, &#x27;thigh&#x27;, and &#x27;fur&#x27;&quot;. Greenberg continues by stating that &quot;[D]erivational, inflectional, and pronominal morphemes and morph alternations are the least subject of all to borrowing&quot;; he does incorporate morphological and pronominal correlations when performing mass comparison, but they are peripheral and few in number compared to his lexical comparisons. Greenberg himself acknowledges the peripheral role they play in his data by saying that they are &quot;not really necessary&quot;. Furthermore, the correlations he lists are neither exclusive to or universally found within the languages which he compares. Greenberg is correct in pointing out that borrowing of pronouns or morphology is rare, but it cannot be ruled out without recourse to a method more sophisticated than mass comparison.

Greenberg continues by claiming that &quot;[R]ecurrent sound correspondences&quot; do not suffice to detect borrowing, since &quot;where loans are numerous, they often show such correspondences&quot;. However, Greenberg misrepresents the practices of mainstream comparative linguistics here; few linguists advocate using sound correspondences to the exclusion of all other kinds of evidence. This additional evidence often helps separate borrowings from inherited vocabulary; for instance, Campbell mentions how &quot;[c]ertain sorts of patterned grammatical evidence (that which resists explanation from borrowing, accident, or typology and universals) can be important testimony, independent of the issue of sound correspondences&quot;. It may not always be possible to separate borrowed and inherited material, but any method has its limits; in the vast majority of cases, the difference can discerned.

=== Chance resemblances ===

Cross-linguistically, chance resemblances between unrelated lexical items are common, due to the large amount of lexemes present across the world&#x27;s languages; for instance, English and Spanish are demonstrably unrelated, despite their similar phonological shape. This means that many of the resemblances found through mass comparison are likely to be coincidental. Greenberg worsens this issue by reconstructing a common ancestor when only a small proportion of the languages he compares actually display a match for any given lexical item, effectively allowing him to cherry-pick similar-looking lexical items from a wide array of languages. Though they are less susceptible to borrowing, pronouns and morphology also typically display a restricted subset of a language&#x27;s phonemic inventory, making cross-linguistic chance resemblances more likely.

Greenberg also allows for a wide semantic latitude when comparing items; while widely accepted linguistic comparisons do allow for a degree of semantic latitude, what he allows for is incommensurably greater; for instance, one of his comparisons involves words for &quot;night&quot;, &quot;excrement&quot;, and &quot;grass&quot;.

==== Sound symbolism and onomatopoeia ====

Proponents of mass comparison often neglect to exclude classes of words that are usually considered to be unreliable for proving linguistic relationships. For instance, Greenberg made no attempt to exclude onomatopoeic words from his data. Onomatopoeic words are often excluded from linguistic comparison, as similar-sounding onomatopoeic words can easily evolve in parallel. Though it is impossible to make a definite judgement as to whether a word is onomatopoeic, certain semantic fields, such as &quot;blow&quot; and &quot;suck&quot;, show a cross-linguistic tendency to be onomatopoeic; making such a judgement may require deep analysis of a type that mass comparison makes difficult. Similarly, Greenberg neglected to exclude items affected by sound symbolism, which often distorts the original shape of lexical items, from his data. Finally, &quot;nursery words&quot;, such as &quot;mama&quot; and &quot;papa&quot; lack evidential value in linguistic comparison, as they are usually thought to derive from the sounds infants make when beginning to acquire languages. Advocates of mass comparison often avoid taking sufficient care to exclude nursery words; one, Merritt Ruhlen has even attempted to downplay the problems inherent in using them in linguistic comparison. The fact that many of indigenous languages of the Americas have pronouns that begin with nasal stops, which Greenberg sees as evidence of common ancestry, may ultimately also be linked to early speech development; Algonquian specialist Ives Goddard notes that &quot;A gesture equivalent to that used to articulate the sound &quot;n&quot; is the single most important voluntary muscular activity of a nursing infant&quot;.

=== Position of Greenberg&#x27;s detractors ===

Since the development of comparative linguistics in the 19th century, a linguist who claims that two languages are related, whether or not there exists historical evidence, is expected to back up that claim by presenting general rules that describe the differences between their lexicons, morphologies, and grammars. The procedure is described in detail in the comparative method article.

For instance, one could demonstrate that Spanish is related to Italian by showing that many words of the former can be mapped to corresponding words of the latter by a relatively small set of replacement rules—such as the correspondence of initial &quot;es-&quot; and &quot;s-&quot;, final &quot;-os&quot; and &quot;-i&quot;, etc. Many similar correspondences exist between the grammars of the two languages. Since those systematic correspondences are extremely unlikely to be random coincidences, the most likely explanation by far is that the two languages have evolved from a single ancestral tongue (Latin, in this case).

All pre-historical language groupings that are widely accepted today—such as the Indo-European, Uralic, Algonquian, and Bantu families—have been established this way.

=== Response of Greenberg&#x27;s defenders ===

The actual development of the comparative method was a more gradual process than Greenberg&#x27;s detractors suppose. It has three decisive moments. The first was Rasmus Rask&#x27;s observation in 1818 of a possible regular sound change in Germanic consonants. The second was Jacob Grimm&#x27;s extension of this observation into a general principle (Grimm&#x27;s law) in 1822. The third was Karl Verner&#x27;s resolution of an irregularity in this sound change (Verner&#x27;s law) in 1875. Only in 1861 did August Schleicher, for the first time, present systematic reconstructions of Indo-European proto-forms (Lehmann 1993:26). Schleicher, however, viewed these reconstructions as extremely tentative (1874:8). He never claimed that they proved the existence of the Indo-European family, which he accepted as a given from previous research—primarily that of Franz Bopp, his great predecessor in Indo-European studies.

Karl Brugmann, who succeeded Schleicher as the leading authority on Indo-European, and the other Neogrammarians of the late 19th century, distilled the work of these scholars into the famous (if often disputed) principle that &quot;every sound change, insofar as it occurs automatically, takes place according to laws that admit of no exception&quot; (Brugmann 1878).

The Neogrammarians did not, however, regard regular sound correspondences or comparative reconstructions as relevant to the proof of genetic relationship between languages. In fact, they made almost no statements on how languages are to be classified (Greenberg 2005:158). The only Neogrammarian to deal with this question was Berthold Delbrück, Brugmann&#x27;s collaborator on the &quot;Grundriß der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen&quot; (Greenberg 2005:158-159, 288). According to Delbrück (1904:121-122, quoted in Greenberg 2005:159), Bopp had claimed to prove the existence of Indo-European in the following way:

:The proof was produced by juxtaposing words and forms of similar meanings. When one considers that in these languages the formation of the inflectional forms of the verb, noun and pronoun agrees in essentials and likewise that an extraordinary number of inflected words agree in their lexical parts, the assumption of chance agreement must appear absurd.

Furthermore, Delbrück took the position later enunciated by Greenberg on the priority of etymologies to sound laws (1884:47, quoted in Greenberg 2005:288): &quot;obvious etymologies are the material from which sound laws are drawn.&quot;

The opinion that sound correspondences or, in another version of the opinion, reconstruction of a proto-language are necessary to show relationship between languages thus dates from the 20th, not the 19th century, and was never a position of the Neogrammarians. Indo-European was recognized by scholars such as William Jones (1786) and Franz Bopp (1816) long before the development of the comparative method.

Furthermore, Indo-European was not the first language family to be recognized by students of language. Semitic had been recognized by European scholars in the 17th century, Finno-Ugric in the 18th. Dravidian was recognized in the mid-19th century by Robert Caldwell (1856), well before the publication of Schleicher&#x27;s comparative reconstructions.

Finally, the supposition that all of the language families generally accepted by linguists today have been established by the comparative method is untrue. Some families were accepted for decades before comparative reconstructions of them were put forward, for example Afro-Asiatic and Sino-Tibetan. Many languages are generally accepted as belonging to a language family even though no comparative reconstruction exists, often because the languages are only attested in fragmentary form, such as the Anatolian language Lydian (Greenberg 2005:161). Conversely, detailed comparative reconstructions exist for some language families which nonetheless remain controversial, such as Altaic. Detractors of Altaic point out that the data collected to show by comparativism the existence of the family is scarce, wrong and non sufficient. Keep in mind that regular phonological correspondences need thousands of lexicon lists to be prepared and compared before being established, and these lists are lacking for many of the proposed families identified through mass comparison. Furthermore, other specific problems affect &quot;comparative&quot; lists of both proposals, like the late attestation for Altaic languages, or the comparison of not certain proto-forms.

=== A continuation of earlier methods? ===

Greenberg claimed that he was at bottom merely continuing the simple but effective method of language classification that had resulted in the discovery of numerous language families prior to the elaboration of the comparative method (1955:1-2, 2005:75) and that had continued to do so thereafter, as in the classification of Hittite as Indo-European in 1917 (Greenberg 2005:160-161). This method consists in essentially two things: resemblances in basic vocabulary and resemblances in inflectional morphemes. If mass comparison differs from it in any obvious way, it would seem to be in the theoretization of an approach that had previously been applied in a relatively ad hoc manner and in the following additions:

*The explicit preference for basic vocabulary over cultural vocabulary.
*The explicit emphasis on comparison of multiple languages rather than bilateral comparisons.
*The very large number of languages simultaneously compared (up to several hundred).
*The introduction of typologically based paths of sound change.

The positions of Greenberg and his critics therefore appear to provide a starkly contrasted alternative:

*According to Greenberg, the identification of sound correspondences and the reconstruction of protolanguages arise from genetic classification.
*According to Greenberg&#x27;s critics, genetic classification arises from the identification of sound correspondences or (others state) the reconstruction of protolanguages.

=== Time limits of the comparative method ===

Besides systematic changes, languages are also subject to random mutations (such as borrowings from other languages, irregular inflections, compounding, and abbreviation) that affect one word at a time, or small subsets of words. For example, Spanish &quot;perro&quot; (dog), which does not come from Latin, cannot be rule-mapped to its Italian equivalent &quot;cane&quot; (the Spanish word &quot;can&quot; is the Latin-derived equivalent but is much less used in everyday conversations, being reserved for more formal purposes). As those sporadic changes accumulate, they will increasingly obscure the systematic ones—just as enough dirt and scratches on a photograph will eventually make the face unrecognisable.

== Toward a resolution of the conflict? ==

In spite of the apparently intractable nature of the conflict between Greenberg and his critics, a few linguists have begun to argue for its resolution. Edward Vajda, noted for his recent proposal of Dené–Yeniseian, attempts to stake out a position that is sympathetic to both Greenberg&#x27;s approach and that of its critics, such as Lyle Campbell and Johanna Nichols.

<text>Portimão () is a city and a municipality in the district of Faro, in the Algarve region of southern Portugal. The population in 2022 was 60,879, in an area of 182.06 km2. It was formerly known as Vila Nova de Portimão. In 1924, it was incorporated as a &quot;cidade&quot; and became known merely as Portimão. Historically a fishing and shipbuilding centre, it has nonetheless developed into a strong tourist centre oriented along its beaches and southern coast. The two largest population centers in the Algarve are Portimão and Faro.

==History==


===Prehistory===
The area was settled during the prehistoric epoch: the Cynetes, influenced by the Celts and Tartessos lived in the Algarve for many centuries. In the area of Alcalar there are several remnants of Neolithic funerary sites of which only one, Alcalar monument number seven, comprising a circular chamber composed of schist stone and long corridor, remains. Comparable to western European and Irish monuments, the funeral crypt, with two lateral ritual niches, was protected by a tumulus: a similar site exists in Monte Canelas.

===Antiquity===
The mouth of the Arade River proved an important natural shelter that soon became a small commercial port for the Phoenicians, Greeks and Carthaginians. The Carthaginians founded two settlements nearby in the mid-6th centuryBC, known by their Roman names and (&quot;Hannibal&#x27;s Port&quot;). The former was the nucleus of present-day Portimão.

Obvious vestiges of the Roman occupation are situated near Figueira, at Quinta da Abicada, in the confluence of two rivers, where the remains of various rooms were unearthed. Also, in the area of Coca Maravilhas was discovered a well-preserved period cistern, while along the Arade River there have been identified gold coins.

===Middle Ages===
In the 5th century, the Algarve was ruled by the Visigoths until the arrival of the Moors. It was during the Moorish occupation that the settlement changed to . The river and its ocean access to the ancient city of Shilb (Silves), then capital of the Arabian Algarve.

===Kingdom===
Along with Silves and Alvor, the small fishing centre in Portimão was reconquered in 1249 from the Arabs by Knights of the Order of Santiago and forcibly integrated into the fledgling Kingdom of Portugal, during the reign of Afonso III of Portugal. Due to the constant raids of pirates, the coastal area of Portimão was considered unsafe to live.

Its geographic location created strong economic conditions to allow the region to prosper, eventually allowing Portimão to obtain the status of town in 1435. The inhabitants understood the necessity of constructing walls, in order to protect themselves from constant invasions. The construction of two forts, the Castle of São João (in Ferragudo) and the Fort of Santa Catarina (Portimão), protected the centre from attacks from pirates and privateers during this period.

In Portimão, a major part of the commerce was accomplished across the sea. The transport across the Arade River was done across a boat that docked at the &quot;Largo de Barca&quot;. Until bridge and road was constructed, 400 years later, it was the only form of crossing the river.

In 1453, King Afonso V of Portugal, under petition from several inhabitants in Portimão, authorized the founding of new settlement, which became the urbanized centre of Portimão (then named &quot;São Lourenço Barrosa&quot;). In 1476, Vila Nova de Portimão is donated by Afonso V of Portugal to his financial inspector, D. Gonçalo Vaz de Castelo Branco, remaining in the family until the 17th century.

The shipbuilding industry took on an important place in the city&#x27;s development. These activities were registered in the royal documents that included authorization of Sebastian of Portugal (in 1536). The king visited in 1573, passing the night and assisting a solemn mass in the Convent of São Francisco.

In the port of Portimão local products, such as figs, olives, oil, wine and fish were regularly exported, while other products from the African and Brazilian colonies, such as slaves and sugar, were introduced into the Portuguese territory. But, by the 17th and 18th century, the rhythm of growth slowed considerably. As commerce decreased the inhabitants emigrated, a fact that accelerated after the 1755 earthquake, causing the destruction within the city. The main church was destroyed, while many of the small chapels were damaged. The city walls were severely damaged, not just by the earthquake but also the resulting tsunami. The Fort of Santa Catarina also suffered damage, but was reconstructed in 1792 and 1794, by the Count of Val de Reys. 

Close to Portimão, Silves Castle was also destroyed in the 1775 earthquake, its Gothic portico with vegetative motifs was later rebuilt. This impressive structure offers a glimpse into the past and a vivid reminder of the region’s historical importance.

Twenty years after the earthquake, the Marquess of Pombal, wanted to make Portimão a bishopric, and in this evolution, he elevated the town to the status of city. Queen Maria I of Portugal vetoed these intentions. The civil statute was only issued in 1924, by the Marquess&#x27; illustrious son Manuel Teixeira Gomes, as Republican president.

===Republic===
In the 19th century, a fishing conserving industry reinvigorated the old city. Now renamed Portimão, the city turned into one of the more important fishing and packing centres in the Algarve, until the 20th century, when the 1980s recession finally caused these businesses to fold. At the end of the 20th century, visitors to the region began travelling to the beaches of Praia da Rocha or Praia da Santa Catarina. On 1 August 1910, the Praia da Rocha Casino was opened, symptom of the growing influx of tourists to the region, many aristocrats from the southern part of the country and Andalusia.

The place became populated by houses and chalets built for, or rented to, the numerous tourists. The first hotel constructed, the Hotel Viola, dated to the first part of the 20th century, and was expanded after 1932, when the space became too small to support the influx of travellers. In 1936, the Hotel Bela Vista was constructed as total tourists began to exceed a thousand people annually. It turned into a popular destination for sport fishing, and among popular nautical sports, jet skiing, sailing, windsurfing, diving and dolphin watching.

==Geography==

The municipality is located on the western southern coast of the Algarve, bordering the municipalities of Lagos, Lagoa, Monchique and Silves.

The geographical distribution of the altitude and relief of the municipality of Portimão generically follow the three types of territory present in the Barlavento: the coastal region, the Barrocal (a region between the coastal region and the mountains) and the mountains up north. Each one with their own geological, morphological and pedagogical characteristics.

The badlands of Ponta João D’Arens host several species of birds and the Ria de Alvor dunes allow the existence of a marshland and estuary, on which a great diversity of species depend, both fauna and flora, as well as the communities of fishermen and local shellfishers.
Portimão is crossed by the Arade River.

=== Climate ===
Portimão has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot dry summers and mild wet winters moderated by the Atlantic Ocean. The lowest temperature the city has ever experienced was in January 1976. Along with other municipalities in the Algarve, Portimão is very sunny, averaging over 3,000 hours of sunshine a year. The average sea temperature is around in winter and in the summer.

Portimão receives approximately 300 to 350 mm of precipitation yearly. The wettest months are November, December, and January, while the driest months are June, July, and August. The city has an average of 8 to 11 rainy days per month during the wet season.

===Human geography===

Portimão is the most important urbanized city in the &quot;Barlavento Algarvio&quot; (the western Algarve), supporting a sizeable population with harbour and a small airfield (Portimão Airport) of its own with schedules flights to some domestic destinations by Aero VIP (the larger Faro International Airport is in the nearby district capital of Faro).
Administratively, the municipality is divided into three civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):

* Alvor (6,154 inhabitants, 2011)
* Mexilhoeira Grande (4,029 inhabitants, 2011)
* Portimão (45,431 inhabitants, 2011)

The municipality is primarily serviced by the A22 motorway (the &quot;Via do Infante&quot;), and the E.N.125 roadway that links it directly to the communities of Alvor (), Mexilhoeira Grande () and Praia da Rocha ().

==Economy==


The community, which was founded on the right margin of the Arade River, and oriented towards the sea, is inserted in a region whose geography and physical characteristics justify a seafaring economy. Its maritime economy allowed the development of industries oriented towards salination of fish, the open-water fishing industry, conservation and canning, the construction of ships and transport. Further, the Arade basin permitted rural commerce associated with cultivation of carob, fig, almonds and the saw-milling/forestry industry (including cork), among others.

In the last quarter of the 20th century, tourism became an accentuated economic factor in the regions growth, with the development of activities oriented towards the sea and development of seasonal infrastructures that permitted an influx of new money. By the beginning of the 21st century, 74% of the roughly 2,000 annual overnight stays originated from the United Kingdom, Portugal and Ireland. Seasonal concentration (44%) usually occurred around the high-summer months (July, August and September).

The Algarve in general is a major draw for tourists. In 2018, the region&#x27;s income from tourism was over a billion euros; the number of visitors totaled 4.2 million. The region&#x27;s tourism contributed €1.08 billion to the economy in that year.

==Architecture==

===Prehistoric===
* Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar ()

===Civic===
* Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada ()

== Main attractions ==

=== Igreja Matriz de Portimão ===
The Igreja Matriz de Portimão (Portimão’s Main Church) from the 17th century is located on the highest point in the city, inside the former walls. The late-Gothic portal is inspired by the most important monument of the time, The Monastery of Batalha. It has undergone several renovations over the years.

=== Forte de Santa Catarina ===
The Fort of Santa Catarina is a historic fort located on the cliffs overlooking Praia da Rocha. The fort was built in the 17th century to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fortress was built on the site where a small chapel dedicated to St. Catherine of Alexandria already existed. Inside the fortifications, the original Gothic portal of this chapel has been preserved. Today, the fort is a popular tourist attraction that offers views of the beach and the sea. The fort also houses a small museum with exhibits on the history of the fort and the city.

=== Portimão Museum ===
Portimão Museum is housed in a former sardine canning factory and features exhibits on the local fishing industry, archaeology, and ethnography. The museum also has a rooftop terrace with views of the city and the river and often hosts external exhibitions such as the Portuguese prison photo project.

=== Marina de Portimão ===
Located in the safest harbour and anchorage of the country, at the Arade river estuary, with over 25-hectares, Marina de Portimão is framed by the historical forts of Santa Catarina and São João. The water in the marina is up to 7m deep, so the vessels can come and go at any time of the tide but the entrance has a sand bar that skippers should be aware of. Marina de Portimão is located within a condominium that includes its beach, restaurants, shops, bars and swimming-pool (not accessible to marina users) with views of the sea.

== Education ==
Besides kindergartens, and primary and secondary education schools with classes from grade 1 to grade 12, Portimão has a branch of the state-run University of Algarve awarding degrees in business management and tourism as well as technical specialization courses in accountancy and post-graduation in real estate appraisal &amp; management, and also a private institution of higher education awarding degrees in fields ranging from law to data science (Instituto Superior Manuel Teixeira Gomes).

== Sports ==
Portimão is known for its sporting events, mostly water sports, including surfing and kitesurfing; motorsport; beach soccer; and the professional football team Portimonense S.C.

===Team sports===
Portimonense S.C. is the main local sports club, with competitive teams in such sports such as basketball, handball, futsal, esports and association football. It is best known for its professional association football team which plays at the Estádio Municipal de Portimão and has competed in the main professional leagues of the Portuguese football league system. In the summer, a beach soccer tournament called the Mundialito de Futebol de Praia (&#x27;Little World Cup&#x27;) is held.

=== Sailing ===
Being located on the South coast of Portugal, Portimão is well known in the sailing world for being an ideal location for sailing on the Atlantic Ocean, boasting much calmer seas and weather conditions than the Western coastline.

Portimão is the host venue for many prestigious sailing events including the annual Portimão, Portugal Match Cup event which is a part of the World Match Racing Tour. The event draws the world&#x27;s best sailing teams to Portimão. The identical supplied (SM-40) boats are raced two at a time. Points accrued count towards the World Match Race Tour and a place in the final event of the season, with the overall winner taking the title ISAF World Match Racing Tour Champion. Match racing is an ideal sport for spectators in Portimão.

=== Powerboating ===
The Portimão coastline has also been host to the sport of powerboating. The Portuguese Grand Prix of the Sea run by Powerboat P1 as part of its international championship is also held in Portimão. 

=== Motorsport ===
In the hills near Portimão stands the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve. Finished in October 2008, it is a race and test circuit officially recognised for the highest categories both for cars and motorcycles. MotoGP races, Superbike races, Le Mans Series races and F1 tests are scheduled. The Lisbon to Dakar Rally passed through here.

The 2020 Portuguese Formula One Grand Prix took place over 66 laps of the 4.684-kilometer Autodromo Internacional do Algarve on Sunday, October 25, and was won by Lewis Hamilton. A month later the 2020 MotoGP season finale also took place at the Autodromo Internacional do Algarve on Sunday, 22 November.

=== Rhythmic gymnastics ===
There is also an annual grand prix of rhythmic gymnastics, with an individual all-round competition, a team all-round competition, and finals by apparatus and by group at senior and junior levels.

=== Scuba diving ===
The Ocean Revival Project saw 4 Portuguese Navy Warships deliberately sunk to form the largest single artificial reef structure in the world.

<text>Giuseppe Vitali (26 August 1875 – 29 February 1932) was an Italian mathematician who worked in several branches of mathematical analysis. He gives his name to several entities in mathematics, most notably the Vitali set with which he was the first to give an example of a non-measurable subset of real numbers.

==Biography==

Giuseppe Vitali was the eldest of five children. His father, Domenico Vitali, worked for a railway company in Ravenna while his mother, Zenobia Casadio, was able to stay at home and look after her children.

He completed his elementary education in Ravenna in 1886, and then spent three years at the Ginnasio Comunale in Ravenna where his performance in the final examinations of 1889 was average.

He continued his secondary education in Ravenna at the Dante Alighieri High School. There his mathematics teacher was Giuseppe Nonni who quickly realised the young Giuseppe had great potential. He wrote to Giuseppe&#x27;s father, in a letter dated 28 June 1895, asking that he allow his son to pursue further studies in mathematics.

He became a student of the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa and graduated to the University of Pisa in 1899. He spent two years as assistant before leaving the academic world. From 1901 to 1922 he taught in secondary schools, first in Sassari, then Voghera and then from 1904 at the Classical High School Christopher Columbus in Genoa. In those years he was involved in politics as a member of the Italian Socialist Party until it was forcibly disbanded by the fascists in 1922. His pursuit of mathematical analysis then led him to almost total social isolation. In 1923 he won a position as professor of calculus at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia . He also taught at the Universities of Padua (1924 to 1925) and Bologna (from 1930). He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Bologna in September 1928, giving the lecture &quot;Rapporti inattesi su alcuni rami della matematica (Unexpected relationships of some branches of mathematics)&quot;.

From 1926 Vitali developed a serious illness and suffered a paralysed arm, meaning he could no longer write. Despite this about half his research papers were written in the last four years of his life.

On 29 February 1932 he delivered a lecture at the University of Bologna and was walking in conversation with fellow mathematician Ettore Bortolotti when he collapsed and died in the street. He was aged 56.

Vitali published a remarkable volume of mathematics over his career with his most significant output taking place in the first eight years of the twentieth century.

He was honoured with election to the Academy of Sciences of Turin in 1928, to the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in 1930, and to the Academy of Bologna in 1931.

== Mathematical contributions ==
In 1905 Vitali was the first to give an example of a non-measurable subset of real numbers, see Vitali set. His covering theorem is a fundamental result in measure theory. He also proved several theorems concerning convergence of sequences of measurable and holomorphic functions. The Vitali convergence theorem generalizes Lebesgue&#x27;s dominated convergence theorem. Another theorem bearing his name gives a sufficient condition for the uniform convergence of a sequence of holomorphic functions on an open domain. This result has been generalized to normal families of meromorphic functions, holomorphic functions of several complex variables, and so on.

In the last part of his life, he also worked on absolute differential calculus and on the geometry of Hilbert spaces.

==Selected works==
A selection of the mathematical papers of Giuseppe Vitali, precisely 35 out of 83 total, some lecture notes from his university courses, a book on the geometry of Hilbert spaces and 100 letters out of 300 total of his correspondence with many other mathematicians of his time are collected in the book .

<text>A yamen (&quot;ya-men&quot;; ; Manchu: &quot;yamun&quot;) was the administrative office or residence of a local bureaucrat or mandarin in imperial China, Korea, and Vietnam. In some places, such as Kowloon Walled City, Hong Kong, it was named as &quot;almshouse&quot;. A &quot;yamen&quot; can also be any governmental office or body headed by a mandarin, at any level of government: the offices of one of the Six Ministries is a &quot;yamen&quot;, but so is a prefectural magistracy. The term has been widely used in China for centuries, but appeared in English during the Qing dynasty.

== Overview ==

Within a local &quot;yamen&quot;, the bureaucrat administered the government business of the town or region. Typical responsibilities of the bureaucrat includes local finance, capital works, judging of civil and criminal cases, and issuing decrees and policies.

Typically, the bureaucrat and his immediate family would live in a residence attached to the &quot;yamen&quot;. This was especially so during the Qing dynasty, when imperial law forbade a person from taking government office in his native province.

&quot;Yamen&quot;s varied greatly in size depending on the level of government they administered, and the seniority of the bureaucrat&#x27;s office. However, a &quot;yamen&quot; at a local level typically had similar features: a front gate, a courtyard and a hall (typically serving as a court of law); offices, prison cells and store rooms; and residences for the bureaucrat, his family and his staff.

At the provincial level and above, specialisation among officials occurred to a greater extent. For example, the three chief officials of a province () controlled the legislative and executive, the judicial, and the military affairs of the province or region. Their &quot;yamen&quot; would accordingly be specialised according to the functions of the office. The great &quot;yamen&quot;s of the central government, located in the capital, are more exclusively office complexes.

== The Yamen Runner in the Ming Dynasty ==

=== General ===
&quot;Yamen&quot; runner () is an occupation which served for &quot;yamen&quot; (), the law enforcement department in ancient China. They worked as the lowest class in the government department which made them a bridge between the common people and the government.

=== Classification ===
There were three kinds of &quot;yamen&quot; runner, zao (), zhuang (), kuai (). But in fact, there were more different kinds in specific . Zao usually served around the court, Zhuang provided physical labor and Kuai were in charge of inspection, investigation, and arrest.

==== Zao ====
Zao acted as the officials&#x27; bodyguards. They usually followed behind the officials. During the trial, they would stand on both sides of the court to maintain order. They also performed the duties of escorting the prisoner, questioning the suspect and applying minor punishment. They had their own black uniform.

==== Zhuang ====
Zhuang were comparable to modern security guards. Their main job was to guard the critical areas such as castle gates, the court, prison, and warehouse. They also patrolled on the streets. Most of them were picked from among strong civilians.

==== Kuai ====
Kuais&#x27; duties included summoning defendants and witnesses to the court. They were usually asked to do the trips for the court, traveling long distances if necessary. During the tax season, they would be sent to remote areas to collect for the government. Therefore, Kuai had more contact with civilians than Zao and Zhuang. They didn&#x27;t have their own uniform, but were required to hang a card on the waist belt to identify themselves.

=== Social status ===
In the Ming Dynasty, due to their duties, &quot;yamen&quot; runners were considered as a debased class (&quot;jianmin&quot;, ), which is even lower than good commoners (&quot;liangmin&quot;, ) such as farmers. It is the lowest stratum in society.

=== Income ===
The salary provided by the court for the &quot;yamen&quot; runner was low compared to other jobs. The average daily salary was enough for only one meal.

While the salary was not enough to live or raise a family on, working for the law enforcement department gave &quot;yamen&quot; runners some power that could be taken advantage of. The runners would charge a small fee from the litigants to cover the spendings. The prefects and magistrates acquiesced such a charging system as long as the amount is in a reasonable range. The Kuai, however, couldn&#x27;t contact the litigants in the lawsuit cases. They would ask for money from the other debased classes like butchers and prostitutes. Such unwritten rule is called dirty regulation (). Therefore, the actual income of the Kuai depended on their place of work; Kuai in large cities could easily collect a lot of money and Kuai in rural areas could be as poor as the homeless.

Such corruption and extortion were rampant during the reign of Xuande Emperor. The prefects and magistrates just turn a deaf ear on their clerks blackmailing the lower classes. Xuande Emperor described them &quot;licentious, greedy, and insatiably exploitative, [or] degenerate and worthless.&quot;

=== Path into the occupation ===
Since the social status of &quot;yamen&quot; runners was low and the income was unstable (usually low), &quot;yamen&quot; runners were mostly formed by vagrants, especially among Kuai. They were often strong but uneducated.

== Paper Yamen Runner ==

A paper yamen runner () is a piece of paper on which a yamen runner was drawn, and upon which is recorded an accusation or tax liability, as well as a demand for the recipient to appear in court or pay the tax. The prefects and magistrates issued this to the litigants or tax defaulters in the hope that they would voluntarily appear in court or pay tax in arrears. It&#x27;s unclear when the paper yamen runner was created, but literature about it can be found during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

Because it was tempting for yamen runners to take unlawful advantage of their position, magistrates would occasionally allow plaintiffs to take litigants to the court first. If a plaintiff failed to do so, the magistrate would issue a paper yamen runner. Only if both methods failed would an actual yamen runner be sent to arrest the litigant. In this way, fewer yamen runners were required. Such practices were typically employed only for mild crimes, however. For serious crimes such as murder, theft, gambling, and fights, the magistrate would still send yamen runners directly for the arrest.

==After 1911==

The institution of the &quot;yamen&quot; fell victim to the Wuchang Uprising and the Xinhai Revolution, after which warlords often became the ultimate authorities, in spite of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s best efforts to establish a Republic of China covering all of China. Sun Yat-sen tried to establish a form of self-government, or home rule, on a regional (or local) basis, but he found that he needed bureaucracy to run a country as big as China. Hence, new bureaucratic offices arose, thus replicating the functions of the Imperial &quot;yamen&quot;s in many ways.

The term &quot;yamen&quot; is still used in colloquial Chinese today, however, to denote government offices. It sometimes carries negative connotations of an arrogant or inefficient bureaucracy.

==Notable &quot;yamen&quot;s==
* The Zongli Yamen acted as an office of foreign affairs in the late Qing dynasty .
* The &quot;yamen&quot; at Kowloon Walled City, Hong Kong is an important historical site.
* The Presidential Palace (Nanjing) was modified from the &quot;yamen&quot; of the Viceroy of Liangjiang.
* The &quot;yamen&quot; of Neixiang County, in Henan, is the best preserved county-level &quot;yamen&quot; in mainland China today.
* The &quot;yamen&quot;s of the six imperial Ministries of the Qing dynasty, in Beijing, were located within what is now Tiananmen Square, and were demolished in stages in the early to mid 20th century.
* The Qing Dynasty Taiwan Provincial Administration Hall in Taipei is the sole surviving Qing Dynasty government building in Taiwan.

<doc id="634992" wikidata="Q6441326" url="?curid=634992" title="Kubrick (toy)">
<text>is a line of collectible block-style figures and associated products created by Japanese toy company MediCom Toy Inc. Kubrick figures are produced in three scales, designated as 100% (six centimeters high), 400% (24 centimeters high), and 1000% (60 centimeters high). The basic Kubrick figure design has a body that resembles an extremely simplified human form, somewhat similar in appearance to Playmobil or Lego figures. Produced in limited numbers and not re-released, Kubricks are highly sought-after by collectors. Kubricks are predominantly collected by adults; the packaging recommends the figures to collectors 13 years or older.

==Overview==

&quot;Kubrick&quot; was chosen in honor of director Stanley Kubrick. In further homage to the film-maker, the Kubrick logo is designed in the style of the logo created for his movie &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. By linguistic coincidence, the name &quot;Kubrick&quot; may also be seen as a hybrid word of the Japanese word &quot;kyu&quot;, meaning the number nine, and the English word &quot;brick&quot;. Nine is the number of bodyparts used in a standard Kubrick figure: head, torso, hips, two arms, two hands, and two legs; the English word &quot;brick&quot; is collector&#x27;s jargon for LEGO elements, and refers to the similarity of Kubricks to Lego Minifigures. 

Kubricks have been produced in many themes. Many figures are licensed representations of film, comic book, or video game characters. Among this diverse range of sources is an even more diverse range of subjects: MediCom has produced Kubricks based on the films &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, and &quot;Amélie&quot; among many others. Comic book characters may be of Japanese origin, such as the &quot;Berserk&quot; series, or American, such as figures based on Marvel Comics and DC Comics characters. In the instance of the Blythe series, MediCom has created a figural toy with another figural toy as its subject. However, not every Kubrick draws on popular culture for inspiration; in addition to creating likenesses of breakfast cereal mascots, MediCom has released a likeness of Andy Warhol, as well as Kubricks in Eames patterns and Pantone colors. They also offer &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;,&quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; sets.

Tatsuhiko Akashi, founder and president of MediCom, developed the basic Kubrick with a former employee of LEGO. The first Kubrick figures were representations of characters from the manga and anime series &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, released in 2000. Since then, hundreds of Kubricks have been produced.

==Packaging==
The packaging design for Kubricks is as varied as the figures themselves. The most common packaging is the &quot;blind box,&quot; in which individual 100% scale figures are packed in small boxes; the only way to know which particular figure is inside a particular box is to purchase and open the box.

In blind box assortments, figures are sold in cases of 12, and each case of 12 figures is further packed into a &quot;master&quot; case of four cases. If a particular collection features six characters, the figures may be packed one each of three of the characters, two of the fourth character, three of the fifth character, and four of the sixth character. This case of 12 figures is then packed four times into a master case, and the ratio may change again, as a result of &quot;chase&quot; figures. Chase figures are produced in addition to the common figures in an assortment; they are neither listed on the box nor announced alongside other new products. In a master case, a chase figure may appear with a ratio of 1:48, or even 1:96. The term for these figures is apt, as collectors must &quot;chase&quot; after these elusive items. For this reason, chase figures are extremely difficult to find, and are among the most sought-after pieces for Kubrick collectors.

Blind box packaging with the addition of chase figures creates an element of chance in purchasing Kubricks, and prompts some collectors to trade figures among themselves to complete their collections.

Some assortment figures are packaged in identifiable small boxes, in contrast to blind box figures. Whether in blind box assortments or not, figures released in assortments are designated as regular or &quot;hikimono&quot;. In addition to regular figures, there are limited edition Kubricks released separately from the regular figures, often packaged on cards with plastic blisters, as well as sets, in which multiple figures or accessories are sold as a single unit, usually packaged in window boxes. Promotional pieces are typically packed in translucent plastic bags.

==Distribution==
Although Kubricks have captured the interest of collectors all over the world, MediCom focuses primarily on the Japanese market, to the extent that MediCom&#x27;s online store ships only to Japanese addresses. Furthermore, Kubricks created as promotional items are not officially sold at retail in Japan. Many pieces are distributed as a part of a larger promotion, such as the wolverine figure released to commemorate the film &quot;X-Men 2: X-Men United&quot; (only available as a limited edition promotional only giveaway with advance ticket purchase for the cinema), or the Master Chief figure, offered as a not-for-sale promo exclusive in Japan for the &quot;Halo 2&quot; video game.

==Related toys==
The collectible value of Kubricks, and the mathematical probability involved in purchasing blind box figures, has unintentionally encouraged the creation of bootleg figures. These unlicensed reproductions are usually produced with low-quality plastic and are easily distinguished by their sloppy paint applications. Kubricks have also inspired other companies to create block figures, including Minimates, produced by the American company Art Asylum.

In response to the success of Kubricks, MediCom have also created an extensive collection of Be@rbricks, figures of a similar size, but that resemble an anthropomorphized bear with a pot belly, as well as B@wbricks, Kubrick-style dogs that stand on four legs.

<text>Piazza Navona () is a public open space in Rome, Italy. It is built on the site of the 1st century AD Stadium of Domitian and follows the form of the open space of the stadium in an elongated oval. The ancient Romans went there to watch the &quot;agones&quot; (&quot;games&quot;), and hence it was known as &quot;Circus Agonalis&quot; (&quot;competition arena&quot;).

In the 17th century it became a showcase for Baroque design, with work by Bernini and Borromini among others. The Fountain Of Four Rivers stands in front of the Church of Sant&#x27;Agnese in Agone.

==History==

The space currently occupied by the Piazza Navona was originally the Stadium of Domitian, built by Emperor Titus Flavius Domitianus in 80 AD. Following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the stadium fell into ruin, being quarried for building materials. There are just a few remains of that today.

Defined as a public space in the last years of 15th century, when the city market was transferred there from the Campidoglio, Piazza Navona was transformed into a highly significant example of Baroque Roman architecture and art during the pontificate of Innocent X, who reigned from 1644 until 1655, and whose family palace, the Palazzo Pamphili, faced the piazza. It features important sculptural creations: in the centre stands the famous Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi or Fountain of the Four Rivers (1651) by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, topped by the Obelisk of Domitian, brought in pieces from the Circus of Maxentius; the church of Sant&#x27;Agnese in Agone by Francesco Borromini, Girolamo Rainaldi, Carlo Rainaldi and others; and the aforementioned Pamphili palace, also by Girolamo Rainaldi, that accommodates the long gallery designed by Borromini and frescoed by Pietro da Cortona.
Piazza Navona has two other fountains. At the southern end is the &quot;Fontana del Moro&quot; with a basin and four Tritons sculpted by Giacomo della Porta (1575) to which, in 1673, Bernini added a statue of a Moor, wrestling with a dolphin. At the northern end is the Fountain of Neptune (1574) also created by Giacomo della Porta; the statue of Neptune, by Antonio Della Bitta, was added in 1878 to create a balance with &quot;La Fontana del Moro&quot;.
During its history, the piazza has hosted theatrical events and other ephemeral activities. From 1652 until 1866, when the festival was suppressed, it was flooded on every Saturday and Sunday in August in elaborate celebrations of the Pamphili family. The pavement level was raised in the 19th century, and in 1869 the market was moved to the nearby Campo de&#x27; Fiori. A Christmas market is held in the piazza square each year from the first week of December until the first week of January.

==Vandalism==
In the early hours of 3 September 2011, the &quot;Fontana del Moro&quot; was damaged by a vandal. Police later found the man, who had been captured on security cameras climbing in the fountain, wielding a large rock and decapitating some of the larger and smaller figures, after they recognised him by his shoes.

<doc id="634995" wikidata="Q1426232" url="?curid=634995" title="St Brides Bay">
<text>St Brides Bay () is a bay in western Pembrokeshire, West Wales.

Either Skomer Island or the mainland extremity of Wooltack Point at the western end of the Marloes Peninsula marks the southern limit of the bay whilst its northern limit is marked by Ramsey Island off St David&#x27;s Head. The mouth of the bay is about wide and extends some eastwards from this line.

==Geology==
The northern and southern shores of the bay are mainly rocky in nature, backed by cliffs up to high. Its eastern shore comprises a series of large and small sandy beaches between rocky sections.

The geological exposures around the bay reveal great complexity with considerable folding and faulting of the strata. The cliffs of its southern shore are formed from sandstones of Ordovician and Devonian age together with a suite of both intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks, some of which are Precambrian in age. Those in the north comprise a series of Precambrian and Cambrian age rocks of both sedimentary and igneous origin. In contrast, the eastern shore is formed from the more readily eroded rocks of Carboniferous age. These are largely the sandstones and mudstones of the Coal Measures but include a small section of shales and sandstones assigned to the Millstone Grit Series. Contorted coal seams within the Coal Measures were once worked though the Pembrokeshire Coalfield was never of major economic importance.

==Designations==
The coast surrounding it forms a part of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park which was designated in 1951 in recognition of the outstanding quality of its landscape. Much of the coastline is also defined as heritage coast. The whole of St Bride&#x27;s Bay along with adjoining areas of sea around the Pembrokeshire Coast is protected under European environmental law as a special area of conservation (or &#x27;SAC&#x27;). Parts of the coast are additionally defined as special protection areas (or &#x27;SPAs&#x27;). There are also three or four sites of special scientific interest (or &#x27;SSSIs&#x27;) around its perimeter.

==Villages and amenities==
The bay&#x27;s coast is dotted with small villages including St Brides, Martin&#x27;s Haven, Little Haven, Broad Haven, Nolton Haven, Newgale and Solva, whilst Britain&#x27;s smallest city, St David&#x27;s lies nearby. The Pembrokeshire Coast Path follows its entire coastline.

It is well known among residents and tourists for fishing.

<text>Parkend is a village, located at the foot of the Cannop Valley, in the Royal Forest of Dean, West Gloucestershire, England, and has a history dating back to the early 17th century. During the 19th century it was a busy industrial village with several coal mines, an ironworks, stoneworks, timber-yard and a tinplate works, but by the early 20th century most had succumbed to a loss of markets and the general industrial decline. In more recent times, the village has become a tourist destination.

== Amenities ==
The village has two public houses, both with guest accommodation, The Fountain Inn and The Woodman Inn. There are also two guesthouses, several holiday let properties, a CIU affiliated club with caravan &amp; camping facilities, and a large camping and caravan site named Whitemead Forest Park; owned and operated by the Civil Service Motoring Association (C.S.M.A.). The Dean Field Studies Centre, once part of Parkend Ironworks, is owned by Bristol City Council and is used to accommodate schoolchildren from that city.

The village and parish church are dedicated to St Paul and situated on the eastern edge of the village in a forest clearing. The shape provides the point of interest, being both octagonal and cruciform, with the arms formed by the sanctuary, north and west transepts and the west tower. It was designed and built in 1822, together with the village school, by Henry Poole; a local priest who raised most of the money through public subscription and his own generosity.

==Sport and Recreation==

Parkend Cricket Club is an English amateur cricket club that is based on the northern edge of the village on Crown Lane.
Parkend have 2 Saturday senior XI teams. The 1st XI compete in the Gloucestershire County Cricket League, and the 2nd XI are in the Cheltenham, Gloucester and Forest of Dean League. They also have a Midweek senior XI team that traditionally took part in the annual West Gloucestershire Cricket Federation &quot;Verderers Cup&quot; competition, and a Sunday XI team that currently play the occasional friendly against neighbouring clubs. 
The Parkend juniors all play competitive cricket in the Leadon Vale Youth Cricket League.

The Parkend Players is an Amateur theatre group that performs most of its shows at the village Memorial Hall.

Parkend Carnival, held on August Bank Holiday Monday, is renowned throughout the forest as being the biggest and best for miles around. 

During the summer, regular Sunday car boot sales are held on the recreation field, the profits from which go to support the Memorial Hall.

The village also has a very active Women&#x27;s Institute.

=== RSPB Nagshead ===
Located on the western edge of the village, RSPB Nagshead is a quiet reserve, open all year. Facilities include a visitor centre, large car park, two viewing hides, two way-marked walks, and a picnic area. Birdlife regularly seen in the reserve includes great spotted woodpecker, Eurasian nuthatch, northern goshawk and common buzzard. Breeding birds include common redstart, pied flycatcher, and common crossbill and wood warbler, whilst Redwing, hawfinch and Eurasian woodcock can be found in winter.

In 1942, nest boxes were erected, in the hope that pied flycatchers would control oak leafroller moths, which were defoliating trees. These boxes have been continually monitored since 1948, making it the world&#x27;s longest running bird breeding programme.

=== Parkend railway station ===
The railway in Parkend began life in 1810, as a horse-drawn tramroad, owned and operated by the Severn and Wye Railway Co. By 1874, the line had been converted to run standard gauge steam locomotives and the station was built in 1875 to enable the company to also run passenger services alongside its freight operations. The level crossing gates by the station are reputedly the longest in Britain.

A decline in coal production and a reduction in passengers saw the station close to regular passenger services in 1929. The last goods train left Parkend on 26 March 1976 and much of the track was dismantled. The line was bought by the Dean Forest Railway, based at Norchard, and Parkend was officially re-opened on Friday 19 May 2006 by the Princess Royal. The station is currently the northern terminus of the Dean Forest Railway.

== History ==

===Early history===
The earliest evidence of human activity in Parkend comes from a hoard of over 1,000 Roman coins, found in the village in 1852, and dating from around AD 300. A lack of other artefacts from the period suggests that the Romans probably did not settle there. History is then silent until 1278, and the first record of a hunting enclosure called ‘Wistemede’ - later known as Whitemead Park. The village&#x27;s location, at one end of this park, is how Parkend derived its name.

In 1612 James I built a charcoal-fired blast furnace and forge at ‘Parke End’, bringing with it the first real settlement, however, ‘The King’s Ironworks’ proved horrendously inefficient and it closed in 1674. It would seem that occupation of the village then ceased until new dwellings appeared from 1747 onwards. Part of the Fountain Inn dates back to 1767 and is the oldest surviving building in Parkend. The first record of a coal mine in Parkend dates back to 1718, although the remains of several bell pits, possibly dating back to the 1600s, are visible in the woods south-west of St Paul&#x27;s church.

===Industrialisation and growth of the village===
With the advent of coke-fired furnaces, Parkend, and its many coal mines, was once again considered an ideal location for the production of iron. In 1799 a new ironworks was constructed near the site of the current post office. Initially it suffered from technical problems, but by the early/mid-1800s it had triggered a major industrialisation of the village.

The need for improved transport links was instrumental in the construction of a horse-drawn tramroad by the Severn &amp; Wye Railway Co in 1810, connecting the village with the docks at Lydney. Demand for coal at the ironworks also lead to the appearance of several large coal mines in the village during the early 1800s, the most notable being &#x27;Castlemain&#x27;.

In 1818/9 another ironworks was also built at Darkhill, just to the west of Parkend, and in 1845 Robert Forester Mushet took over management of the site. One of his greatest achievements was to perfect the Bessemer Process by discovering the solution to early quality problems which beset the process. In a second key advance in metallurgy Mushet invented &#x27;R Mushet&#x27;s Special Steel&#x27; (R.M.S.) in 1868. It was both the first true tool steel and the first air-hardening steel. It revolutionised the design of machine tools and the progress of industrial metalworking, and was the forerunner of High speed steel. The remains of Darkhill are now preserved as an Industrial Archaeological Site of International Importance and are open to the public.

In 1825, the lower pond at Cannop and a 1½ mile leat were constructed to provide a constant supply of water to a waterwheel at Parkend Ironworks. Despite the enormous effort expended in creating this supply, it proved inadequate and an engine house and steam engine were added in 1828. A second pond at Cannop was also constructed a year later.

The school and St Paul’s church were built in 1822 and Henry Poole, who had designed both, became Parkend’s first vicar. He moved into the new vicarage in 1829, but the school developed structural problems and was rebuilt, on the same site, in 1845.

A stone works opened in 1850 and a tinplate works was constructed in 1853. It stood to the left of the ironworks, and further along was built a row of terraced houses, known as ‘The Square’, which were used to accommodate the workers there.

In 1864 the Severn and Wye Railway Company began operating steam locomotives on the existing tramway. This proved to be unsatisfactory and 1868 the company also added a broad-gauge steam railway line, but both were removed and replaced with standard gauge tracks by 1874. At around the same time, a loading wharf, known as Marsh Sidings, was constructed and Parkend railway station opened in 1875, allowing the company to also operate passenger trains alongside its freight operations.

In 1871 a third furnace was added at Parkend Ironworks, but the optimism behind this investment was to be short-lived.

===Periods of industrial decline===
During the mid-1870s, industry in the Forest, and across the country as a whole, quickly began to slide into a deep recession. Parkend Tinplate Works, and the ironworks that had dominated the village for 90 years, succumbed to a loss of markets and both closed in 1877. Just a few years before, these two businesses alone had been employing 500 people between them, but even this was overshadowed by the closure of the Parkend coal pits in 1880, which went into voluntary liquidation with the loss of 700 jobs.

By the mid-1880s, the industrial decline that had gripped the Forest was beginning to ease. The mines, which had closed in 1880, reopened in 1885 and by the 1890s they were prospering once again. The ironworks did not re-open and were demolished by 1909, although the imposing engine-house survived to become the country’s first Forester Training School in 1910.

The 1920s proved to be another difficult period for the residents of Parkend. The high demand for coal, that had been created by the First World War, was followed by a slump and industrial unrest. Matters were made worse as the local mines were now finding it difficult to access coal easily, and some had been worked out completely. There were major strikes in 1921 and 1926, and all the village mines, except New Fancy, finally closed for the last time in 1929. There was a considerable knock-on effect for other industries too and the railway closed to passengers in the same year. Parkend stone works closed in 1932, marking the end of heavy industry in the village.

===Modern history===
The Forester Training School was commandeered by the War Office during WWII and used as a barracks by the American army. After the war it reverted to being a forestry school until it was bought by Avon County Council in 1972, for use as a field-studies centre, and regularly hosts groups of school children.

The houses known as ‘The Square’ were demolished in the mid-1950s and their occupants re-housed in a new council estate. Another housing development, of 26 dwellings, was built near the railway station, in 2004.

Whitemead Park, which had been the Forestry Commission’s headquarters since 1814, was bought by the Civil Service Motoring Association in 1970. It opened as a caravan site in 1971 and is now the largest tourist accommodation facility in the forest.

Freight operations by the railway continued at Marsh Sidings up until 1976, after which much of the track was dismantled. The line was bought by the Dean Forest Railway Preservation Society and Parkend station was officially re-opened by princess Anne on 19 May 2006.

<text>Self-parenting is a paradigm that explains the characteristic interaction between the two voices having conversation inside a person&#x27;s mind.

The idea of self-parenting is that a person&#x27;s &quot;mind&quot; is created in the form of a conversation between two voices generated by the two parts of the cerebral hemisphere. One is the &quot;inner parent&quot; represented by the left brain with the other voice being the &quot;inner child&quot; represented by the right brain. The manner and quality by which these &quot;inner conversations&quot; take place between the two voices is most accurately described as self-parenting. The inner parent is parenting the inner child within the inner conversations.|

Another way of seeing self-parenting through a different perspective is first off knowing that usually some individuals are not strong when it comes to dealing with problems with their inner self; they usually need a mentor with positive feedback, there to guide them with certain strategies and most of all to overcome obstacles. Most of the time when they are in need to dealing with the forces of reality, they may place too much pressure on certain people.

The individual quality of a person&#x27;s self-parenting style is said to closely resemble the specific style of parenting they received growing up as child.

<text>Stormwatch is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by WildStorm, which later became an imprint of DC Comics. Created by Jim Lee, the team first appeared in &quot;Stormwatch&quot; #1 (March 1993). After the WildStorm imprint was retired and its universe was merged with the main DC Universe, the group was depicted as a secretive team of superheroes who tackle dangerous missions while remaining unknown to the larger superhero community.

==Publication history==
===&quot;Stormwatch&quot;===

Stormwatch (run by a fictional United Nations) is overseen from a satellite by its director, the Weatherman. The Weatherman was Henry Bendix, who had cybernetic implants connected to his brain to better monitor the world situation and his Stormwatch teams in action. His field commander was Jackson King (also known as Battalion, an American telekinetic). Other founding members include Hellstrike (an Irish police officer who is an energy being), Winter (an ex-Russian Spetznaz officer and an energy absorber), Fuji (a young Japanese man, an energy being trapped in a containment suit) and Diva (a young Italian woman with sonic powers).

The team first appeared in the eponymous comic book &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, published by Image Comics and owned by Jim Lee. Early writers of &quot;Stormwatch&quot; included Jim Lee, Brandon Choi, H. K. Proger and Ron Marz; early artists included Scott Clark, Brett Booth, Matt Broome and Renato Arlem.

Marz, who had worked on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; and developed Hal Jordan&#x27;s Green Lantern replacement Kyle Rayner at DC Comics, took over the writing while James Robinson was writing &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot;. Robinson and Marz, directed by Jim Lee, intertwined the books&#x27; storylines over several months.

Around this time, two two-issue miniseries were published: &quot;Stormwatch Team One&quot; (written by James Robinson) and &quot;WildC.A.T.s Team One&quot; (written by Steven Seagle). In the intertwined miniseries, the groundwork for both teams was laid in the mid-1960s by a core group consisting of Saul Baxter (Lord Emp), Zealot, Majestic, John Colt (the template for Spartan), Backlash, a young Bendix and Jackson King&#x27;s father Isaiah, all of whom would be members of (or figure prominently in) the later Stormwatch and &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; teams. In this series &quot;WildStorm&quot;, the publishing imprint name, was a code word used by the United States Government: &quot;Wild&quot; was extraterrestrial life-forms, and &quot;Storm&quot; was invading forces.

Robinson&#x27;s &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; and Marz&#x27;s &quot;Stormwatch&quot; culminated in the &quot;Wildstorm Rising&quot; storyline, during which both teams were disrupted; Stormwatch incurred casualties, and the WildC.A.T.s were believed dead. After WildStorm Rising, Alan Moore took over the writing of &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot;. After a second imprint-wide crossover, Warren Ellis took over writing &quot;Stormwatch&quot; with #37 (July 1996).

===Warren Ellis and &quot;Stormwatch&quot; Vol. 2===
Warren Ellis&#x27;s run would refocus the stories and redefine the cast of characters while tying-up the first volume (with issue #50) and spanning the entire 12-issue run of the second volume. His version of &quot;Stormwatch&quot; injected sexual and horror elements, thinly-disguised political commentary and criticism of the United States government into the stories. The accompanying art was toned down from the more-exaggerated 1990s superhero-style, which dominated the early Image Comics, helping to emphasize the science fiction aspect of the storylines. During this period Ellis used &quot;Stormwatch&quot; to introduce the concept of the Bleed, a space between parallel universes which later featured in &quot;Planetary&quot; and other comics set in the Wildstorm Universe. By the end of volume one Ellis made Henry Bendix a manipulative villain.

Ellis continued to write the book into &quot;Stormwatch&quot; volume 2, until the August 1998 &quot;WildC.A.T.s/Aliens&quot; crossover (also written by Ellis) which saw the Stormwatch team decimated by xenomorphs (the creatures from the &quot;Alien&quot; film series). Most of the Stormwatch characters Ellis had not created were killed off in this story while the surviving characters he had created became the main cast of Ellis&#x27; new series, &quot;The Authority&quot;, including Jenny Sparks, Jack Hawksmoor, Apollo, the Midnighter, and Swift (who debuted in Stormwatch vol. 1 #28, written by Jeff Mariotte) as well as two new characters who were successors of the Engineer and the Doctor from Ellis&#x27; &quot;Change or Die&quot; storyline. &quot;Stormwatch&quot; volume 2 ended with a story, set after &quot;WildC.A.T.s/Aliens&quot;, in which the United Nations disbanded Stormwatch. The last scene, a conversation between former members of Stormwatch Black, introduced The Authority and promoted its first issue. Other survivors from the original team (including Battalion, Christine Trelane, and Flint) appeared briefly in &quot;The Authority&quot;, and King and Trelane became central characters of &quot;The Monarchy&quot;.

Ellis&#x27;s use of concepts and characters he developed in Stormwatch extended into other WildStorm projects as well. Notably, &quot;Planetary&quot;. In the 11th issue of &quot;Planetary&quot;, John Stone, a secret agent modeled after a combination of James Bond and Nick Fury (of Jim Steranko&#x27;s &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;) works for a 1960s precursor of Stormwatch named &quot;S.T.O.R.M.&quot;, working out of a command center known as &quot;S.T.O.R.M. Watch.&quot; References were also made to Jenny Sparks, the Bleed, and the ability to teleport via &quot;doors.&quot;

===&quot;Stormwatch: Team Achilles&quot;===

In September 2002, &quot;Stormwatch&quot; was revived as &quot;Stormwatch: Team Achilles&quot;, written by Micah Ian Wright. The series followed a human UN troubleshooting team dealing with superhuman-related problems. The planned final issue (#24) was never published, although its script is available for download online.

===&quot;Stormwatch: Post Human Division&quot;===

&quot;Stormwatch&quot; was one of several comic books restarted after Wildstorm Comics&#x27; WorldStorm event. This version was launched in November 2006 with writer Christos Gage and penciller Doug Mahnke. The series ended after issue #12, but resumed in August 2008 as part of the World’s End event with issue #13. In the new series several dead characters (Hellstrike, Fuji, Winter and Fahrenheit) were resurrected and reformed as the new version of Stormwatch Prime (now sponsored by the United States), and a separate branch office — &quot;Stormwatch: P.H.D.&quot; (Post-Human Division) — was opened in New York.

===The New 52===
DC Comics announced in June 2011 that the team would be incorporated into the DC Universe in a new series, written by Paul Cornell and drawn by Miguel Sepulveda, as part of the September 2011 relaunch of its comics. Peter Milligan took over the book in issue nine after leaving &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; with issue eight.

This Stormwatch, an organization which has protected Earth from alien threats since the Dark Ages, is commanded by a group known as the Shadow Cabinet: a four-member group of Shadow Lords referred to as &quot;the dead&quot;, and represented by an entity which can negate the group&#x27;s powers and is aware of their secrets (except Harry&#x27;s). Rejecting the title &quot;superheroes&quot;, Stormwatch — Jack Hawksmoor, Apollo, Midnighter, Jenny Quantum, the Engineer, the Martian Manhunter (who left the team after wiping everyone&#x27;s memory of him), and three new characters: Adam One (an immortal born during the Big Bang, who was later revealed to be Merlin), Emma Rice, the Projectionist (who controls the mass media) and Harry Tanner, the Eminence of Blades (the world&#x27;s greatest swordsman) — exist in secret and consider themselves professional soldiers. Their base is a hijacked Daemonite spaceship in Hyperspace, later upgraded into the Carrier.
Jim Starlin wrote &quot;Stormwatch&quot; with #19, erasing the team&#x27;s history as a 1,000-year-old organization and restarting its history again. Apollo and Midnighter were returned to their original costumes as the core of a new Stormwatch team with the Engineer, Hellstrike, the Weird and new characters Jenny Soul, the Forecaster, and Force. After Starlin&#x27;s run ended with #29, Sterling Gates wrote the series&#x27; 30th and final issue which restored the previous version of the team. The team then appeared in &quot;The New 52: Futures End&quot; weekly limited series.

<text>Goldwyn Pictures Corporation was an American motion picture production company that operated from 1916 to 1924 when it was merged with two other production companies to form the major studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was founded on November 19, 1916, by Samuel Goldfish (who later changed his name to Goldwyn), an executive at Lasky&#x27;s Feature Play Company, and Broadway producer brothers Edgar and Archibald Selwyn, using an amalgamation of both last names to name the company.

The studio proved moderately successful, but became most famous due to its iconic Leo the Lion trademark. Although Metro was the nominal survivor, the merged studio inherited Goldwyn&#x27;s old facility in Culver City, California, where it would remain until 1986. The merged studio also retained Goldwyn&#x27;s Leo the Lion logo.

Lee Shubert of The Shubert Organization was an investor in the company.

==History==
Samuel Goldfish had left Lasky&#x27;s Feature Play Company, of which he was a co-founder, in 1916 when Feature Play merged with Famous Players. Margaret Mayo, Edgar Selwyn&#x27;s wife and play writer, and Arthur Hopkins, a Broadway producer, joined the trio as writer and director general.

At the beginning, Goldwyn Pictures rented production facilities from Solax Studios when it and many other early film studios in America&#x27;s first motion picture industry were based in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The company&#x27;s first release was &quot;Polly of the Circus&quot;, an adaptation of Mayo&#x27;s 1907 play of the same name, released in September 1917 and starting Mae Marsh. By April 1917, Goldwyn Pictures agreed to rent the Universal Pictures studios in Fort Lee, then having the second largest stage, and had two film companies operating at the time with plans for more production companies. The company management planned on having 12 films done by September 1, 1917, without distributing the films so as to be able to show advanced footage to the theaters. Goldfish also associated the company with Columbia University via Professor Victor Freeburg&#x27;s Photoplay Writing class in 1917 to increase the company&#x27;s artistic standings. The company also released other production companies films with Marie Dressler&#x27;s Dressler Producing Corporation film, The Scrub Lady, in 1917. The company was forced in October 1917 to switch out &quot;The Eternal Magalene&quot; for &quot;Fighting Odds&quot;, both starring Maxine Elliott, after the National Board of Review cleared the Magalene movie while censors in Pennsylvania state and Chicago city did not approve the film. &quot;Thais&quot; starring Mary Garden was released in late 1917 which was a costly loss.

In January 1918, Goldfish signed director Raoul Walsh and prematurely announced it as there were two years left on Walsh&#x27;s contract with Fox. With &quot;Thais&quot; being the company&#x27;s second costly loss, Goldfish decreased film budgets partly by not using theater divas to cross over to film and reducing design driven films. Instead, he relied on comedies starring Madge Kennedy and Mabel Normand. In August 1918, Goldwyn Pictures signed Will Rogers, at that time a Broadway Follies favorite, to star in a Rex Beach production, &quot;Laughing Bill Hyde&quot;, filmed at the Fort Lee studio for release in September. The company purchased the Triangle Studios in Culver City in 1918. Goldfish then headed west to Culver City, California in 1918; opening operations there also caused an increase in film expenses. Seeing an opportunity in December, Samuel Goldfish then had his name legally changed to Samuel Goldwyn.

In 1919, Frank Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Godsol became an investor in Goldwyn Pictures. Since 1912, Godsol had been making deals for the Shubert Organization in the U.S. and abroad.

Goldwyn began looking to follow other film companies, like Loews Theaters/Metro Pictures and First National, into vertical integration. Goldwyn and the company backers were looking at renting the Astor Theatre for movie premiers. Instead, with the Capitol Theatre soon to be opened and the owners, headed by Messmore Kendall, looking for an operator to partner with, agreed to a stock swap and board seats, the Goldwyn Picture company and Moredall Realty Corporation. The Moredall Board, however, did not want the theater to rely only on Goldwyn films and operated The Capitol Theatre separately from the rest of the company. 

By 1920, in addition owning its Culver City studio, Goldwyn Pictures was renting two New York studios and operations in Fort Lee.

After many personality clashes on the board, Samuel Goldwyn left the company in 1922. Godsol remained chairman of the board of Goldwyn Pictures in 1922. As things went from bad to worse at Goldwyn, In 1923 Messmore Kendall, along with Lee Shubert had discussions with Marcus Loew about merging the company with Loew&#x27;s Metro Pictures and after many long negotiations, all parties agreed to the merger. Louis B. Mayer heard about the pending merger and contacted Loew and Godsol, about adding his Louis B. Mayer Productions into the post-merger company, which became the blockbuster Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

A 1965 fire in an MGM storage facility destroyed many negatives and prints, including the best-quality copies of every Goldwyn picture produced prior to 1924; over half of MGM&#x27;s feature films from before 1930 are completely lost. On March 25, 1986, Ted Turner and his Turner Broadcasting System company purchased the pre-May 1986 MGM films (including Goldwyn Pictures films) from Kirk Kerkorian for $600 million.

<text>Count Juan Raphael Dante (born John Timothy Keehan; February 2, 1939 – May 25, 1975) was an American martial artist figure during the 1960s and 1970s who claimed he could do extraordinary feats such as Dim Mak.

==Early career==
Keehan was born in Beverly, Chicago, on February 2, 1939, to a well-to-do Irish American family. His father, Jack, was a physician and director of the Ashland State Bank, and his mother, Dorothy, occasionally appeared on the society pages of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Keehan attended Mount Carmel High School and boxed at Johnny Coulon&#x27;s 63rd Street gym, and after graduating from high school he joined the Marine Reserves and later the Army, where he learned hand-to-hand combat and jujitsu techniques. He trained under various martial arts masters during the infancy of Western interest in Asian martial arts during the 1950s. Most notable of the early masters he trained under was sensei Robert Trias. Keehan, after gaining his black belt in karate, went on to become a sensei himself.

Keehan was the Midwest director of the United States Karate Association (USKA) until 1962. He left that organization in 1964 to form a so-called World Karate Federation. In 1990, a new World Karate Federation unassociated with Keehan&#x27;s was formed.

In Chicago, Keehan co-promoted America&#x27;s first full-contact style martial arts tournament at the University of Chicago on July 28, 1963, and hosted many other such tournaments during the 1960s, pairing practitioners of different styles against each other.

Keehan also worked as a hairdresser.

==Dan-te==
Keehan grew disillusioned with conventional karate instruction&#x27;s focus on ceremony, tradition and protocol over what he felt to be &quot;effectiveness&quot; and began developing his own style that he would promote as &quot;street-effective&quot;. Through these efforts, he developed a system that became known as the Dan-te system, &quot;Dance of Death&quot; or sometimes the Kata-Dante. Theoretically, by learning all of the steps of Keehan&#x27;s &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, you would thereby become an effective fighting master.

==&quot;The Deadliest Man Alive&quot;==
In 1967, Keehan legally changed his name to &quot;Count Juan Raphael Danté&quot;, explaining the name change by stating that his parents fled Spain during the Spanish Civil War, changed their names, and obscured their noble heritage in order to effectively hide in America from Spaniard anti-royalist communists. (Count Dantès is the protagonist of Dumas&#x27; 1844 &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.) Keehan was prone to boasts that furthered his reputation, his most notorious one being that he&#x27;d participated in secret &quot;death matches&quot; in Thailand and China, winning by killing opponents in front of crowds numbering in the thousands.

He began heavily promoting himself via comic book ads as the &quot;Deadliest Man Alive&quot;. One had only to mail order his instructional booklet &quot;World&#x27;s Deadliest Fighting Secrets&quot; (in which he outlined the &quot;Dance of Death&quot;) to also receive a free Black Dragon Fighting Society membership card. These comic book ads account for much of Count Dante&#x27;s lasting notoriety in pop culture. They read
Yes, this is the DEADLIEST and most TERRIFYING fighting art known to man—and WITHOUT EQUAL. Its MAIMING, MUTILATING, DISFIGURING, PARALYZING and CRIPPLING techniques are known by only a few people in the world. An expert at DIM MAK could easily kill many Judo, Karate, Kung Fu, Aikido, and Gung Fu experts at one time with only finger-tip pressure using his murderous POISON HAND WEAPONS. Instructing you step by step thru each move in this manual is none other than COUNT DANTE — THE DEADLIEST MAN WHO EVER LIVED.
The Black Dragon Fighting Society founded by Count Dante is an American martial arts organization and has no connection with and should not be confused with the Japanese Black Dragon Society, an ultranationalist secret society during the 1930s and 1940s.

==The Dojo Wars==
The various enmities culminated in the Dojo War incident of April 24, 1970, where Dante and some of his students performed a dojo storm on Green Dragon Society&#x27;s Black Cobra Hall. According to press coverage, upon entering the school, they claimed to be police officers and attacked the rival dojo&#x27;s students. The brief battle resulted in the death of one of Dante&#x27;s friends and fellow sensei, Jim Koncevic.

Former mob lawyer Robert Cooley states in his autobiography &quot;When Corruption was King&quot; that he represented Count Dante during the trial following the 1970 Dojo War incident. Cooley recalls that Dante was ultimately acquitted but not before both sides were given a stern lecture by the judge citing everyone at fault. Cooley also suggests that Dante was a mastermind in the notorious 1974 Chicago Purolator vault robbery in which the amount of $4.3 million was stolen. While not one of the suspects in the trial, Dante was allegedly questioned by Illinois grand jury and ultimately passed a lie detector test. Dante died shortly before the trial was completed which resulted in the conviction of all but one person involved.

==Death==
Count Dante died in his sleep of internal hemorrhaging caused by a bleeding ulcer, on May 25, 1975.

<doc id="635015" wikidata="Q2840625" url="?curid=635015" title="Alvy Moore">
<text>Jack Alvin &quot;Alvy&quot; Moore (December 5, 1921 – May 4, 1997) was an American actor best known for his role as scatterbrained county agricultural agent Hank Kimball on the CBS television series &quot;Green Acres&quot;. His character would often make a statement, only to immediately negate the statement himself and then negate the corrected statement until his stream of statements was interrupted by a frustrated Oliver Wendell Douglas portrayed by Eddie Albert. One such statement was, &quot;Good morning, Mr. Douglas! Well, it&#x27;s not a good morning ... but it&#x27;s not a bad morning either!&quot; Moore appeared in 142 of the 170 total Green Acres episodes.

==Early life==
Alvy Moore was born in Vincennes, Indiana, the son of Indiana natives Roy and Elice Moore. When Alvy was young the family moved to Terre Haute, where Roy was a grocery store manager. Alvy was president of the senior class at Wiley High School in 1940–41. He then attended Indiana State Teachers College—now Indiana State University—both before and after service with the United States Marine Corps during World War II, in which he saw combat in the Battle of Iwo Jima.

==Acting career==
He became an actor and furthered his training at the Pasadena Playhouse, succeeding David Wayne in the role of Ensign Pulver opposite Henry Fonda&#x27;s &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; on Broadway, and later toured with the play for 14 months. He made his screen debut playing the quartermaster in &quot;Okinawa&quot; (1952).

Moore appeared in guest and supporting roles in a number of movies and television shows, including &quot;My Little Margie&quot; in 1952, as Dillard Crumbly, an efficiency expert fresh out of Efficiency College, and &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, where he hosted &quot;What I Want to Be&quot; segments as the Roving Reporter. He had a small role as a member of Marlon Brando&#x27;s motorcycle gang in the 1953 film &quot;The Wild One&quot;, and a similar bit part the same year as one of the Linda Rosa townspeople in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Moore co-starred with Dick Powell and Debbie Reynolds in the 1954 film &quot;Susan Slept Here&quot;, in which he displayed his natural gift for physical comedy. In 1955, he co-starred with Brian Keith and Kim Novak in &quot;5 Against the House&quot;. In the early 1960s he was cast in the recurring role of Howie in 11 episodes of the CBS sitcom &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;, with Harry Morgan and Cara Williams.

Moore made a brief appearance as a cab driver in the 1964 &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode &quot;The Case of the Wednesday Woman.&quot; He also appeared in two episodes of another CBS sitcom, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;The Impractical Joke&quot; posing, for a spoof, as an Internal Revenue Service agent and &quot;The Case Of The Pillow&quot; as a shifty home goods salesman named Mr. Wiley. In 1965 he appeared in an episode of &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; (&quot;Old Man Carter&quot;). He found his niche in television, starring as the incompetent county agent Hank Kimball in &quot;Green Acres&quot; from 1965 to 1971. He was also a guest star on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and later on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. He was an actor, producer, and uncredited scriptwriter for &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot;. He attended DisCon II, the 1974 World Science Fiction Convention, to help promote the film. In 1978, Moore appeared as stage coach station master Swenson in three episodes of &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (S2 E6 &quot;Cattle Drive,&quot; S2 E7 &quot;Robbers Roost,&quot; and S2 E10 &quot;Gold&quot;). One of Moore&#x27;s last television appearances was a brief guest shot on the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;.

In the 1980s Moore appeared in many cult horror films, including &quot;Scream&quot; (1981), &quot;Mortuary&quot; (1983), &quot;They&#x27;re Playing With Fire&quot; (1984), &quot;Intruder&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Horror Show&quot; (1989).

==Personal life==
Moore met Carolyn Mohr in 1947 while both were actors with the Pasadena Playhouse. They married in 1950 and traveled with the national touring company of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; before settling in Los Angeles to start their family. The couple had three children: Janet, Alyson, and Barry. Carolyn continued to be involved in acting, doing dinner theater and various church productions.

In his spare time during the 1960s, he umpired Little League baseball in Lake View Terrace and Toluca Lake, California, and played in charity golf tournaments across the country. He was proud of his role of Hank Kimball in &quot;Green Acres&quot;, and drove a white Chrysler with the license plate &quot;GRNACRS.&quot;

Alvy and Carolyn Moore were married 47 years. Alvy died of heart failure on May 4, 1997, at their home in Palm Desert, California. Former Green Acres actor Tom Lester was with him when he died. For over 50 years Carolyn was a member of Beta Sigma Phi, a women&#x27;s sorority group that raises money for charity. In 2008 she received the &quot;International Award of Distinction,&quot; the highest honor the organization bestows on active members. She also was a member and treasurer of the &quot;Motion Picture Mothers&quot; for over 30 years. Carolyn Moore died at age 79 in 2009.

<text>Thomas William Lester (September 23, 1938 – April 20, 2020) was an American actor and evangelist. He was best known for his role as farmhand Eb Dawson on the television show &quot;Green Acres&quot; as well as crossover appearances on Petticoat Junction, which was set near &quot;Green Acres&#x27;&quot; fictional town of Hooterville. He appeared in two feature animal films, &quot;Gordy&quot; and &quot;Benji&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Lester was born in Laurel, Mississippi, one of two children (both sons) of Pat Lester (1913–2009), an accountant with Gulf Oil, and Mary Sue (Thornton) Lester (1914–2009), a manager with Home Interiors and Gifts.

In 1948, he became a born-again Christian, and became involved in the Baptist church. At that time he said he thought the Lord&#x27;s plan for his life would deliver him to Hollywood, California, to embark on an acting career. He discussed his plans and his dream of becoming an actor with his parents.

After he graduated from Laurel High School, he attended the University of Mississippi, where he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity, and received a B.Sc. degree in chemistry and biology. He briefly attended graduate school at the University of Southern Mississippi, but acting became his main interest.
After college he taught school in Purcell, Oklahoma, but he left for Los Angeles. In his early 20s he attended the First Baptist Church of Beverly Hills, California.

==&quot;Eb Dawson&quot; role==

After moving to Hollywood, Lester met radio and character actress Lurene Tuttle, who became his friend and acting coach. She suggested he begin work in the Little Theater, which he did, acting in showcases at the North Hollywood Playhouse.
In the early 1960s, Lester appeared in a play with CBS producer Paul Henning&#x27;s daughter Linda Kaye Henning (Betty Jo Bradley of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;), and Lester soon found himself auditioning for the role of Eb Dawson, farmhand to Oliver Wendell Douglas (played by Eddie Albert) on &quot;Green Acres&quot;. Lester beat around 400 other actors to play the character after a screen test.

Lester later said he won the role because he was the only actor who auditioned who knew how to milk a cow since he grew up on a farm in Mississippi. His recurring role soon became a regular character due to the character&#x27;s and the show&#x27;s popularity.

As several &quot;Green Acres&quot; characters also appeared in episodes of two other CBS series – &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; – Lester, as Eb Dawson, also occasionally appeared on those shows. Even during the height of &quot;Green Acres&quot;&#x27; popularity, Lester lived modestly in a small apartment over a garage in the San Fernando Valley. Each year during the show&#x27;s summer hiatus he would travel the country and speak at churches, youth rallies and revival meetings and at one time worked for the Reverend Billy Graham&#x27;s organization.

Lester appeared in nearly every &quot;Green Acres&quot; episode between 1965 and 1971, with the exception of the first half of the 1967–68 season when he was ill with mononucleosis. The show&#x27;s explanation for Eb&#x27;s absence was that he had eloped and was on his honeymoon. After six seasons, &quot;Green Acres&quot; was cancelled in 1971 as part of CBS&#x27;s &quot;rural purge&quot;.

==Career after &quot;Green Acres&quot;==
After &quot;Green Acres&quot;, Lester was typecast as Eb Dawson. In 1990, he reunited with Albert and Eva Gabor to reprise his role in &quot;Return to Green Acres&quot;.

He returned to his parents&#x27; home in Laurel, Mississippi, but continued to do an occasional movie or TV role. During the mid-1970s to early 1980s, his roles included guest spots in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot; and &quot;Love, American Style&quot;. In 1991, he played the adult Pete Maravich in the film about the future basketball hall-of-famer&#x27;s youth, &quot;The Pistol: The Birth of a Legend&quot;. In 2004, he was the voice of the unseen DJ for radio station KCOW in the movie &quot;Christmas Child&quot; (starring William R. Moses and Steven Curtis Chapman). In 2014, he starred with Ray Stevens and Victoria Jackson in the comedy &quot;Campin&#x27; Buddies&quot;.

Lester was a farmer and for many years had been a Christian speaker who traveled the nation, preaching a message of faith and obedience. He still participated in autograph shows and fan forums, often dressed as Eb Dawson.

With the death of Mary Grace Canfield, who portrayed Ralph Monroe, on February 15, 2014, Lester was the last surviving regular cast member of &quot;Green Acres.&quot;

==Friendship with Eddie Albert==
Lester referred to Eddie Albert as his &quot;surrogate father&quot;. The two guest-starred on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, which featured Albert&#x27;s good friend, Buddy Ebsen, for one episode. When &quot;Green Acres&quot; was canceled in 1971, Albert and Lester remained close friends and continued to stay in touch until Albert&#x27;s death in 2005. They both attended Gabor&#x27;s funeral in 1995. On May 26, 2005, Albert died of complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Lester was the only surviving &quot;Green Acres&quot; star who did not attend the funeral.

==Personal life and death==
Lester was married for the only time in July 2007 at the age of 68. He and his wife Kaylie lived on the 250-acre family farm in Vossburg, Mississippi.

In 1997, Lester was the recipient of Mississippi&#x27;s &quot;Wildlife Farmer of the Year&quot; award.

On April 20, 2020, Lester died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was 81. He was survived by his wife, Kaylie, and one brother.

<text>San Diego Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium in San Diego, California, United States. Opened in 1967 as San Diego Stadium; it was renamed Jack Murphy Stadium for sportswriter Jack Murphy from 1981 to 1997. From 1997 to 2017, the stadium&#x27;s naming rights were owned by Qualcomm; it was named Qualcomm Stadium. The naming rights expired on June 14, 2017, and were purchased by San Diego County Credit Union, renaming the stadium to SDCCU Stadium on September 19, 2017; those naming rights expired in December 2020. Demolition of San Diego Stadium began in December 2020; its last freestanding section was felled on March 22, 2021.

The stadium was the longtime home for two teams of the major professional sports leagues: the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League (NFL) and the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball (MLB). The Chargers played at the stadium from 1967 through the 2016 season, after which they moved to the Greater Los Angeles area to become the Los Angeles Chargers. The Padres played home games at the stadium from their founding in 1969 through the 2003 season, then moved to Petco Park in downtown San Diego. Additionally, the stadium hosted the San Diego Sockers of the North American Soccer League (NASL) from 1978 through the 1984 season.

San Diego Stadium was the home of the San Diego State Aztecs football team from 1967 through 2019. A college football bowl game, the Holiday Bowl, was held in the stadium every December from 1978 through 2019. The stadium was home to a second college bowl game, the Poinsettia Bowl, from 2005 until its discontinuation following the 2016 edition. In 2020, San Diego State University (SDSU) purchased the stadium site, with plans to develop the area into a noncontiguous campus expansion following the stadium&#x27;s demolition, now known as SDSU Mission Valley. Snapdragon Stadium opened on the site in 2022 as the new home for the Aztecs football team.

The stadium hosted three Super Bowls: XXII in 1988, XXXII in 1998, and XXXVII in 2003. It also hosted the 1984 and 1998 World Series, the 1978 and 1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and games of the 1996 and 1998 National League Division Series and the 1984 and 1998 National League Championship Series. It was the only stadium ever to host both the Super Bowl and the World Series in the same year (1998), and was one of three stadiums to host the Super Bowl, World Series, and the MLB All-Star Game, along with the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles.

==History==

In the early 1960s, local sportswriter Jack Murphy, the brother of New York Mets broadcaster Bob Murphy, began to build up support for a multi-purpose stadium for San Diego. In November 1965, a $27 million bond was passed allowing construction to begin on a stadium, which was designed in the Brutalist style. Construction on the stadium began one month later. When completed, the facility was named San Diego Stadium.

The stadium was the first of the square-circle &quot;octorad&quot; style, which was thought to be an improvement over the other multi-purpose stadiums of the time for hosting both football and baseball (the second and last of this style was the since-imploded Veterans Stadium). Despite the theoretical improvements of this style, most of the seats were still very far away from the action on the field, especially during baseball games.

The Chargers (then a member of the American Football League) played the first game ever at the stadium on August 20, 1967. San Diego Stadium had a capacity of around 50,000; the three-tier grandstand was in the shape of a horseshoe, with the east end low (consisting of only one tier, partially topped by a large scoreboard). The Chargers were the main tenant of the stadium until 1968, when the AAA Pacific Coast League San Diego Padres baseball team played its last season in the stadium, following their move from the minor league-sized Westgate Park. Due to expansion of Major League Baseball, this team was replaced by the current San Diego Padres major-league team beginning in the 1969 season. (The Padres moved out of the stadium following the 2003 season.) The original scoreboard, a black-and-white scoreboard created by All American Scoreboards, was replaced in 1978 by one manufactured by American Sign and Indicator, which was the first full-color outdoor scoreboard ever built. This was replaced in 1987 by a White Way Sign scoreboard, in which the video screen is surrounded almost entirely by three message boards. The original video board was replaced in 1996 by a Sony JumboTron, with a second JumboTron installed behind the opposite end zone (third base in the stadium&#x27;s baseball configuration).
After Jack Murphy&#x27;s death in September 1980, San Diego Stadium was renamed San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium by a 6–2 vote of the San Diego City Council on January 6, 1981. In 1983, over 9,000 bleachers were added to the lower deck on the open end of the stadium raising the capacity to 59,022.

The most substantial addition was completed in 1997, when the stadium was fully enclosed, with the exception of where the scoreboard is located. Nearly 11,000 seats were added in readiness for Super Bowl XXXII in 1998, bringing the capacity to 70,561. Also in 1997, the facility was renamed Qualcomm Stadium after Qualcomm Corporation paid $18 million for the naming rights. The naming rights belonged to Qualcomm until 2017, after which the rights were purchased by San Diego County Credit Union. In order to continue to honor Murphy, the city named the stadium site Jack Murphy Field. However, as part of the naming agreement Jack Murphy Field was not allowed to be used alongside Qualcomm Stadium. Some San Diegans, however, still refer to the stadium as &quot;Jack Murphy&quot; or simply &quot;The Murph&quot;. Before his death in 2004, Bob Murphy still referred to it as Jack Murphy Stadium during New York Mets broadcasts, even after it was renamed. However, this renovation relegated the Padres within their own stadium, as the city gave the Chargers full financial control of the 113 luxury suites. The stadium was temporarily renamed &quot;Snapdragon Stadium&quot; for 10 days in December 2011 as a marketing tie in for Qualcomm&#x27;s Snapdragon brand. The legality of the temporary name change was challenged at the time, since it was agreed to unilaterally by San Diego&#x27;s mayor, without approval from the City Council and against the advice of the City Attorney. The Aztecs&#x27; new stadium, built in 2022 after the demolition of SDCCU Stadium, has the permanent name of Snapdragon Stadium.

With the departure of the Padres to Petco Park following the 2003 season and even beforehand, there was much talk of replacing the increasingly obsolete (by NFL standards) stadium with a more modern, football-only one. Also, the NFL had demanded a new stadium if San Diego was to host another Super Bowl; however, the city struggled to fund such a new stadium. On January 12, 2017, the Chargers announced they were moving to Los Angeles and now play at SoFi Stadium with the Los Angeles Rams. In 2018, San Diego State University announced the construction of a new Aztec Stadium (later renamed Snapdragon Stadium, which would be completed in 2022) on an expansion part of campus on the site of the stadium and parking lot.
On December 27, 2019, the stadium hosted the San Diego County Credit Union Holiday Bowl, a college football bowl game between Iowa and USC (Iowa won the game), this was the final sporting event ever played at the stadium. Demolition of the stadium commenced in December 2020.

===Super Bowls (NFL)===

=== All-Star Games (MLB) ===

==Configurations==

In order to accommodate the dimensions of both football and baseball fields, the stadium was constructed with half of the lower (Field Level) level seating built of permanent concrete (in the southern quadrant of the stadium), and the other half of portable modular construction using aluminum or steel framing.

When the stadium was configured for baseball, the portable sections would be placed in the western quadrant of the stadium along the third base-left field side. Open bullpens were located along both foul lines just beyond the ends of the Field-level seats. In the Padres&#x27; final five seasons at the stadium from 1999 to 2003, the home plate area took on the shape of home plate itself (as opposed to the standard circle); this feature is seen in Detroit&#x27;s Comerica Park today.

In the football configuration, the portable seating sections were placed in the northern quadrant of the stadium (covering what is used as left field in the baseball configuration) to allow for the football field to be laid out east–west (along the first base/right field foul line, with the western end zone placed in the area occupied by the portable seating sections in the baseball configuration, and the eastern end zone along the right-center field wall).

Doorways were cut in the walls of the stadium in order to allow access to these seats from the tunnel below the Plaza level in both configurations (in baseball configuration, the football doors could be seen above the left field inner wall; in football configuration, the baseball doors were visible above the west end zone, opposite the scoreboard). These doors were rolling metal overhead doors, with the field side painted to match the surrounding walls facing the field.

==Tenants==

===Padres===
From their inception in 1969 until the end of 2003, when they moved into Petco Park in the downtown area, the National League&#x27;s San Diego Padres called the stadium home.

The field dimensions varied slightly over the years. In 1969, the distance from home plate to the left and right field wall was , the distance to the left- and right-center field power alleys was , and the distance from home plate to center field was . A wall, whose top was the rim of the Plaza level, surrounded the outfield, making home runs difficult to hit. Later, an eight-foot fence was erected, cutting the distances to 327, 368, and , respectively. In 1996, a note of asymmetry was introduced when a high scoreboard displaying out-of-town scores was erected along the right-field wall near the foul pole and deemed to be in play, and so the distances to right field and right-center field were and , respectively, while the remaining dimensions remained the same.

Orel Hershiser broke Don Drysdale&#x27;s scoreless inning streak at Jack Murphy Stadium on September 28, 1988, as the Los Angeles Dodgers played the San Diego Padres. Rickey Henderson collected his 3000th major league base hit at Jack Murphy Stadium on October 7, 2001 as a Padre, in what was also the last major league game for Tony Gwynn, the eight-time National League batting champion and Hall of Famer who played his entire career with San Diego. It was also before a Padres game where comedian Roseanne Barr gave her infamous rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; in 1990.

===Chargers===
The stadium was the site of the 1980 AFC Championship Game, which the &quot;Bolts&quot; lost to their AFC West and in-state rival, the Oakland Raiders, 34–27. The Chargers also hosted Wild Card and Divisional Playoff games in 1979, 1980, 1992, 1994, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, going 5–6 in all playoff games held at the stadium. The Chargers won all their games at the stadium against the Detroit Lions (5–0—0) and Jacksonville Jaguars (4–0—0), but lost all their meetups against the Atlanta Falcons (0–6—0), Carolina Panthers (0–3—0), and Green Bay Packers (0–6—0). The Chargers moved to Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, a suburb of Los Angeles, following the 2016 NFL season.

===Aztecs===
Since its inception, the stadium, which was approximately five miles from campus, had been the home of the San Diego State Aztecs football team through the 2019 season, the final season before demolition of the stadium commenced. Before the building of the stadium, they had played their games at Balboa Stadium and their on-campus stadium, Aztec Bowl (which is now the site of Viejas Arena, the home of the university&#x27;s basketball teams). Traditionally, the team, clad in all-black uniforms and red helmets, has played its home games at night, a tradition started during the days of former head coach Don Coryell before the stadium was even opened. There have been attempts in the past to change from &quot;The Look&quot;, but all have been associated with subsequent poor play by the Aztecs and a return to the traditional look.

==Other football games==
Following the 1978 college football season, the stadium began hosting the Holiday Bowl, an annual bowl game held before New Year&#x27;s Day. It originally hosted the Western Athletic Conference champion (at the time, the hometown Aztecs had just joined this conference) against a nationally ranked opponent. The game has traditionally been a high-scoring affair, and until the 2006 edition no team had ever been held to ten points or less. From 1995 through 2004, every &quot;losing&quot; team scored at least 20 points. The 1984 game is well known for being the culmination of BYU&#x27;s championship season, the last Division I-A (now FBS) national championship not won by a member of a Power Five conference or a major independent program.

On December 22, 2005, a second bowl game came to San Diego when the inaugural Poinsettia Bowl was played at the stadium, with Navy beating Colorado State. The Poinsettia Bowl was organized by the same organizing committee as the Holiday Bowl. It was officially discontinued after the 2016 game, as the organizing committee announced (in January 2017) that it had decided to host only one game, beginning with the 2017 season.

On October 27, 2018, the Navy Midshipmen hosted the Notre Dame Fighting Irish at the stadium for a regular season game.

The stadium was the home field for the San Diego Fleet of the AAF. They played 4 home games at the then named SDCCU Stadium in February and March 2019, with a home record of 3–1, before the league folded following week 8 of the inaugural season.

CIF San Diego Section Finals for high school football were held at the stadium. These usually took place on a Friday in early December, and four games were played (with eight teams representing four separate divisions, which are determined by the enrollment sizes of the individual schools).

==Soccer==
The stadium was a venue for many international soccer matches. The stadium hosted FIFA tournaments, including the CONCACAF Gold Cup, and the U.S. Cup (an international invitational), as well as many international friendly matches involving the Mexico national team. The most recent international friendly at the stadium set an all-time attendance record for the sport in the region. The match between Mexico and Argentina which was held on June 4, 2008, drew 68,498 spectators. In addition, the stadium was part of the 18-stadium United States 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, but the United States did not win either bid for the World Cup.

The stadium also hosted several international friendlies featuring clubs such as Real Madrid, Chivas, Portsmouth F.C. and Club América.

The San Diego Sockers of the North American Soccer League played at the stadium from 1978 to 1983. The stadium was the venue of Soccer Bowl &#x27;82 of the North American Soccer League and Major League Soccer&#x27;s 1999 All-Star Game.

On January 29, 2017, the USMNT played a friendly (exhibition) match against Serbia, the first ever meeting between the two teams. The match finished as a 0–0 draw.

The stadium hosted two group stage matches of the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

On July 25, 2018, the stadium hosted a 2018 International Champions Cup match between A.S. Roma and Tottenham Hotspur. Tottenham Hotspur won 4–1.

In 2019, the stadium hosted matches of National Independent Soccer Association club San Diego 1904 FC.

==Other sports==
In October 1967, just weeks after the stadium opened, it hosted a Sports Car Club of America event organized by San Diego Region. The event was not held in the stadium itself, but on a temporary course mapped out through the stadium&#x27;s parking lot. In July 1968, the Region organized a SCCA National for the car park, now called the San Diego Stadium International Raceway, but the combination of a very small crowd and complaints about the noise ensured that the experiment was not repeated.

The stadium also hosted rugby matches. In October 1980, the United States played New Zealand in a rugby match televised on ESPN. With 14,000 fans in attendance, this game at the time was the largest crowd ever to watch an international rugby game in the US. Old Mission Beach Athletic Club RFC played rugby union at the adjacent mini-stadium, so-called Little Q.

The stadium was home to a round of the AMA Supercross Championship each year, usually in early February, from 1980 to 2014. The stadium also hosted a round of Monster Jam, also ran and operated by Feld Entertainment. In 2015, both events were moved to Petco Park.

ESPN held their inaugural Moto X World Championships at the stadium in April 2008, and has previously used the stadium parking lot and surrounding streets as a venue in the X Games Street Luge competition.

On May 4 and 18, 2013, the stadium was used as a racecourse by the Stadium Super Trucks.

==Concerts on the Green==
Concerts on the Green was a sports field converted into a music and entertainment venue, located on the southwest corner of the stadium parking lot. The field was originally used as a practice venue for the San Diego Chargers. After the team moved to Chargers Park about a mile north of the stadium, the area was used primarily for rugby. AEG leased the area and retrofit it into an open-air amphitheater for concerts and other entertainment shows. The venue had the capability to hold 12,500, making it the second biggest entertainment venue in the Greater San Diego area; only North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre seated more.

==Non-sporting events==

===Concerts===
Many concerts were also held inside the stadium over the years, by artists of many different genres.

In 1983 rock radio station KGB 101.5 FM hosted the KGB Skyshow 8 with Uriah Heep, Eddie Money, Mötley Crüe and Def Leppard finishing the show.

===In TV and movies===
&quot;American Idol&quot; (season 7) held auditions there in July 2007; a total of 30 people who auditioned there made it to the next round.

In a January 30, 2009, episode of &quot;Monk&quot;, The stadium was known as Summit Stadium in the episode &quot;Mr. Monk Makes the Playoffs&quot; with the fictitious San Francisco Condors as the home team.

Many parts of the 1979 film &quot;The Kid from Left Field&quot; were filmed in and around the stadium.

The ending to the 1978 film &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&quot; was filmed on the field, using locals as extras.

===The Little Q===
The Little Q was a sports field, used primarily for rugby located adjacent to the stadium; the Little Q was home to San Diego&#x27;s Super League rugby team OMBAC and the College Premier Division San Diego State University Aztec rugby team.

=== Big SoCal Euro ===
Big SoCal Euro was a gathering of European car enthusiasts. It attracts over 3,000 car lovers every year. Not only is Big SoCal Euro one of the largest all European car gatherings, but it is also one of the oldest events of its kind, established in 2002. It had been held at the stadium since 2007. The event was founded by Lon Mok of SoCalEuro.com

===Other events===
Billy Graham hosted a crusade at the stadium in early May 2003.

During the Cedar Fire in October 2003 and the October 2007 California wildfires, the stadium served as an evacuation site for those living in affected areas. (This was similar to the use of the Houston Astrodome and the New Orleans Superdome during Hurricane Katrina.) The Cedar Fire forced the Chargers to move a contest with the Miami Dolphins to Arizona State University&#x27;s Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, the San Diego County Council of the Boy Scouts of America used the stadium&#x27;s concourse areas (between the rear of the grandstands and the freestanding wall which contains the entrance gates) as well as portions of the parking lots as the site of its annual Scout Fair. The San Diego County Council has since merged with the council representing Imperial County to form the Desert Pacific Council.

==Sale and demolition==
On June 30, 2020, the City of San Diego approved the sale of the stadium to San Diego State University (SDSU) and on August 10, 2020, the university officially took control. A new stadium broke ground on the site one week later and ultimately opened in 2022 as Snapdragon Stadium, with a seating capacity of 35,000 to support events including SDSU football, non-football NCAA championship games, professional soccer, a possible future NFL team, and special events such as concerts. Following failed efforts in 2010 and 2016 to build a new stadium in downtown San Diego&#x27;s East Village, SDSU bought the entire , including the existing stadium, from the city for $88 million. A competing redevelopment proposal, known as SoccerCity, envisioned that stadium site could be leased from the city and redeveloped with private funding if San Diego was awarded a Major League Soccer team. The SoccerCity proposal was placed on the November 2018 ballot alongside the SDSU proposal but was defeated. The entire $3.5 billion SDSU project includes housing, office, and retail space, hotels, and 80 acres of parks and open space including a 34-acre river park on city property and will be rolled out in phases over 8–10 years.

The stadium was scheduled to be decommissioned following the end of the 2021 college football season while Snapdragon Stadium was being constructed on the existing parking lot. However, on September 15, 2020, San Diego State University announced that the stadium would be demolished in early 2021. The stadium was taken down in pieces starting in December 2020 rather than being imploded due to the California environmental law. The 2020 and 2021 seasons were played at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson until Snapdragon Stadium&#x27;s completion for the 2022 season.

On March 22, 2021, the last freestanding section of San Diego Stadium visible from Interstates 8 and 15 was felled, leaving the plaza level to be demolished.

<text>The Stanley Gibbons Group plc is a company quoted on the London Stock Exchange specialising in the retailing of collectable postage stamps and similar products. The group is incorporated in London. The company is a major stamp dealer and philatelic publisher. The company&#x27;s philatelic subsidiary, Stanley Gibbons Limited, had a royal warrant of appointment from Queen Elizabeth II.

== History ==

The company has a long corporate history, having started as a sole trader business owned by Edward Stanley Gibbons in 1856 and now being a quoted company with a number of subsidiaries.

===Before 1900===
The business started when, employed as an assistant in his father&#x27;s pharmacy shop in Plymouth, Gibbons set up a counter selling stamps. In 1863 he was fortunate enough to purchase from two sailors a sackful of rare Cape of Good Hope triangular stamps.

In 1874 Gibbons moved to a house near Clapham Common in South London and in 1876 he moved again to Gower Street in Bloomsbury near the British Museum.

By 1890 Stanley Gibbons wished to retire and the business was sold to Charles Phillips for £25,000 (equivalent to £ million in ). Phillips became managing director, with Gibbons as chairman.

In 1891 a shop was opened at 435 Strand in addition to the Gower Street premises, and in 1893 the shop and offices were amalgamated at 391 Strand where the company&#x27;s retail premises remained for many years until they moved to 399 Strand.
===1900–1959===
A new issue department was opened in 1906. In 1914 the company received a royal warrant from George V, followed in 1940 by another from George VI. In 1956 the company celebrated its centenary with an exhibition at the Waldorf Hotel opened by Sir John Wilson. In the same year, Queen Elizabeth II granted her royal warrant to Stanley Gibbons Ltd as her philatelist.

===1960s===
In 1967 the firm expanded into the United States in a joint venture with Whitman Publishing. A magazine and catalogues were produced.

In 1968 the previously privately company was floated on the stock market through a tender arranged by S.G. Warburg. The offer was a huge success and was oversubscribed five times. The shares were sold at 20 shillings rather than the minimum tender price of 12 shillings and six pence. It was estimated that there were 30 to 35 shareholders before the offer and they still owned 66% of the equity after the offer, worth at least £1.8 million before trading began. Prices subsequently slipped back, however, later in the year.

===1970s===
In 1970 The Crown Agents acquired a 20% stake in the company and appointed two Directors to the Gibbons board. The stake was sold in 1976 by which time it had grown to 25% of the company.

In 1977 Stanley Gibbons acquired the stock of the firm Chas Nissen, once run by the eminent stamp dealer and philatelist Charles Nissen.

In 1979 Gibbons was bought by Letraset for £19 million in an attempt to diversify away from their dry-lettering business, but the acquisition did not go smoothly and, like Flying Flowers later, Letraset found it difficult to integrate Gibbons into its core business. The chairman of Letraset blamed &quot;indiscriminate expansion&quot; and &quot;imprudent&quot; investment decisions for the problems at Gibbons and was quoted in &quot;The Times&quot; as saying &quot;We significantly overpaid for what we got.&quot; The US$10 million paid by Gibbons for the Marc Haas collection was also questioned.

===1980s===
In 1981 Letraset was acquired by Esselte after a takeover battle with Mills &amp; Allen International. Letraset had been fatally weakened by its lossmaking Stanley Gibbons subsidiary. Later that year Gibbons was put up for sale by Esselte as they said it did not form a logical part of their long-term development.

In 1981 Gibbons bought the stock of the late H.F. Johnson.

In 1982 Clive Feigenbaum staged a management buy-out followed by an application in 1984 for a listing on the UK&#x27;s Unlisted Securities Market in order to raise funds for new acquisitions. Following the buy-out, Feigenbaum, the chairman, had owned over 50% of the shares with the others owned by the rest of the board. The listing went ahead but the shares were suspended within moments of their debut even before trading had begun, following concerns about Feigenbaum&#x27;s background highlighted in an article in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;. The suspension was said to be the fastest on record at that time. The concerns had surrounded Feigenbaum&#x27;s expulsion from the Philatelic Traders Society for breaching their code of ethics and his sale of &quot;23 carat gold&quot; stamps of no postal validity from the island of Staffa. U.S. government tests had shown the stamps, sold at £10 each, to have a gold value of about 5c each. The debacle was said to have caused considerable embarrassment, not just to the company but also to its USM brokers Simon &amp; Coates. Shortly afterwards, Feigenbaum resigned as chairman and was bought out by a consortium of institutions and individuals for £3 million. A further attempt at a listing was planned for 1985 but did not go ahead.

In 1989 Paul Fraser began to invest in the firm, and he purchased a further 30% stake in the company from New Zealand businessman Sir Ron Brierley who is a stamp collector.

===1990s===
Paul Fraser was appointed Executive Chairman in 1990. By 1995 Fraser had acquired 76.83% of Gibbons shares and he purchased the rest of the shares in December 1995.

In June 1998 the company was sold for £13.5 million to Flying Flowers. Paul Fraser took shares in Flying Flowers instead of cash and was left with an 8% stake in the enlarged company following the deal. The merger was not a success and in 2000 the two companies were demerged again after a series of profits warnings and trading problems. Paul Fraser&#x27;s stake was reduced in value from £13.5 million to £4 million. The de-merged Stanley Gibbons became communitie.com and was listed on AIM. The chairman of Flying Flowers was quoted as saying the deal &quot;...was at the wrong price and at the wrong time.&quot;

=== Since 2000 ===
In August 2007, Paul Fraser resigned as Executive Chairman and in April 2008 he sold his remaining shares to focus on Paul Fraser Collectibles. Bob Henkhuzens became interim chairman and the current chairman is David Bralsford, who works in a non-executive capacity.

On 20 September 2010 the company announced it had acquired the trade and assets of the Benham first day cover and collectibles business from Flying Brands Limited. On 21 November 2013, Stanley Gibbons successfully completed its acquisition of Noble Investments, bringing Apex, Baldwin&#x27;s, and Dreweatts &amp; Bloomsbury Auctions into the group. In 2014, two further acquisitions followed: On 31 January the company acquired Murray Payne, the world&#x27;s leading dealer in British Commonwealth King George VI stamps and on 23 October The Fine Art Auction Group, holding company of the Group&#x27;s subsidiary, Dreweatts and Bloomsbury, announced that it had acquired Mallett Antiques - a dealer in antiques and decorative arts with retail premises on London&#x27;s Dover St and New York&#x27;s Madison Avenue.

On 28 January 2015 the company was awarded &#x27;Deal of the Year&#x27; at the 2015 Quoted Company Awards for its acquisition of Noble Investments.

In July 2015 the company announced that The Fine Art Auction Group had acquired Bid for Wine, a specialist online wine auctioneer founded in 2008 by barrister Spenser Hilliard and ex-management consultant Lionel Nierop.

Later in 2015 the group&#x27;s share value started to fall significantly, dropping from 240p in August 2015 to 15.75p in April 2016. This general decline continued, with lows of 1.5p being recorded in March 2020.

Stanley Gibbons (Guernsey) Limited, the group&#x27;s subsidiary which handled investment portfolios, was placed under administration on 21 November 2017, with Nick Vermeulen and Zelf Hussain as joint administrators.

On 8 June 2021, Stanley Gibbons purchased the British Guiana 1c magenta at auction for $8,307,000. The company has since offered shares in the stamp to collectors using the showpiece platform.

On 22 December 2023, Stanley Gibbons announced the company&#x27;s insolvency. In a &quot;pre-pack administration process&quot; the business was bought back by a new company called Strand Collectibles Group.

==Stamp catalogues==
The first Stanley Gibbons stamp catalogue was a penny price list issued in November 1865 and reissued at monthly intervals for the next 14 years. The company produces numerous catalogues covering different countries, regions and specialisms; many of them are reissued annually. The catalogues list all known adhesive postage stamp issues and include prices for used and unused stamps.

Unlike other dealers&#x27; catalogues, Stanley Gibbons state that their catalogue is a retail price list. In other words, if they had that exact stamp in stock in the exact condition specified, the current catalogue price is the price that they would charge for it. This contrasts with most other catalogues which are produced by firms that do not sell stamps and therefore base their pricing on an average of market values in the country where the catalogue is published.

In practice, the actual price charged by Stanley Gibbons for an individual stamp may be different from the catalogue price because the specimen for sale is of a different grade, the market conditions have changed since the catalogue was produced, the firm has a plentiful or restricted supply of that stamp, or for a variety of other reasons.

==Magazines==

&quot;Gibbons Stamp Monthly&quot; is a magazine that lists new issues and publishes articles of interest to philatelists. Gibbons have published a number of journals over the years but only settled on Gibbons Stamp Monthly as their core magazine in 1927. On 23 January 2009, Gibbons acquired the philatelic trade magazine &quot;The Philatelic Exporter&quot; from Heritage Studios Limited.

==Retail stamp business==
As well as publishing, Stanley Gibbons is a stamp dealer with a retail business located on the Strand in their Central London offices offering both older stamps and new issues and fulfilling customer want lists. They produce their own line of other philatelic products, such as albums, stock books, and other accessories.

==Auction house==
The company is also a philatelic auction house and has held thousands of international sales since it was established in 1901.

<doc id="635027" wikidata="Q824983" url="?curid=635027" title="Sámi flag">
<text>The Sámi flag is the flag of Sápmi and the Sámi people, one of the Indigenous people groups of the Nordic countries and the Kola Peninsula of the Russian Federation.

== First Sámi flag ==
The first, unofficial Sámi flag was designed by Sami politician and activist Marit Stueng from Kárašjohka in 1962, using a blue, red, and yellow color pattern commonly used on gákti, the traditional Sámi garb. The design was used locally in Kárašjohka as a flag, as well as in publications such as &quot;Kátalåga 1971&quot;. &quot;Kátalåga 1971&quot; was published in 1972 by the Karasjok Library for Sámi Literature, and the cover was designed by Nils Viktor Aslaksen. With the growth of Sámi activism and the ČSV movement, several proposals for a Sámi flag were developed, although none gained prominence until the Alta controversy.

In 1977, as the protests in Alta Municipality over a dam on the river Altaelva grew, Sámi artist Synnøve Persen from Porsáŋggu Municipality made the artworks &quot;Forslag til Samisk flagg&quot; (Blueprint for a Sámi Flag) and &quot;Sámiland for Sámi&quot;, both of which used a design similar to Stueng&#x27;s flag. Persen credited other Nordic flags and traditional Sámi designs for her proposal. Despite the earlier origin of Stueng&#x27;s flag, Persen&#x27;s work gained notice and became a symbol of the Alta protests. Persen&#x27;s artworks were acquired by the National Museum in 2018, after being featured locally and internationally in multiple media and exhibitions; it is usually introduced as &quot;the first Sámi flag&quot; without reference to Marit Stueng.

== Second Sámi flag ==
The first official Sámi flag was recognized and inaugurated on 15 August 1986 by the 13th Nordic Sami Conference in Åre, Sweden. The flag was the result of a competition sponsored by the newspaper &quot;Sámi Áigi&quot; for which more than seventy suggestions were entered. In the end, one new design was considered against the existing, unofficial flag - and came out winning. The design was submitted by the Coast Sámi artist Astrid Båhl from Ivgubahta/Skibotn, in Tromssa/Troms county, Norway.

The basic structure of the first Sámi flag was retained, but Båhl added the colour green, which is popular on many South Sámi gáktis. These four colours have been known since then as &quot;the Sámi (national) colours&quot;. She also added a motif derived from a sun/moon symbol appearing on many shaman&#x27;s drums. While the drawings on shaman&#x27;s drums were only made in red (using an extract of the sacred alder tree), the motif on the flag uses both blue and red—the first representing the moon, the latter representing the sun. The Pantone colour formula used is: red 485C, green 356C, yellow 116C and blue 286C.

=== Children of the Sun ===
The motif was chosen with the poem &quot;Päiven Pārne&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Sons of the Sun&quot;) in mind. The poem was written down by the South Sámi Protestant priest Anders Fjellner in the mid-1800s from a joik rich with elements of Sámi shamanism. The poem describes the Sámi as &quot;sons and daughters of the sun&quot;, through the union between a female &quot;giant&quot; (an unidentified mythological entity) who lives in a &quot;House of Death&quot; far in the North, and the Sun&#x27;s male offspring with whom she elopes. The Sámi are also referred to as &quot;offspring of the Sons of the Sun&quot; in &quot;Sami soga lavlla,&quot; the Sámi anthem.

== Official status ==
Seventeen years after its adoption by the Sámi Council, in 2003, the Sámi flag received official status in Norway, the country with the largest Sámi population. It is now compulsory for municipalities in Norway to fly the flag on 6 February, the Sámi National Day. The flag is also flown in parts of Finland and Sweden (especially Lapland) on the same day. 

The Sámi Council earlier had full ownership to the flag and other national symbols, but since the 18th Sámi Conference they now share that ownership with the Sámi Parliamentary Council. The joint committee of national symbols also has the duty right to determine new national symbols in accordance with international principles of heraldry.

== Sami flag days ==

==Related symbols==
===Sámi Parliaments===
The logo of the Sámi Parliament of Sweden features a circle in the four Sámi colours, while the Sámi Parliament of Finland features a circle and the three colours of the first Sámi flag. The Sámi Parliament of Norway&#x27;s current logo does not incorporate elements of the flag.

===Finnmark Estate===
&quot;Finnmárkuopmodat&quot;, the autonomous entity established by the Finnmark Act has a logo that according to the entity&#x27;s website &quot;gets it colours from the Sámi and the Norwegian flag, as a symbol that the Finnmark Estate feels related to and responsible for both Sámi and Kvens, as well as ethnic Norwegians. [...] The circular shape... refers both to the Sámi flag&#x27;s sun-symbol and to the solid and safe envelopment of a circle. [...] It is opened up to allow the Northern Lights a gateway into the Norwegian and the Sámi flag&#x27;s colours.&quot;

===Russian Sámi Organs===
The elected Council of Plenipotentiary Representatives of the Sámi of Murmansk Province uses a symbol heavily inspired by the flag: two reindeer horns joined like a crescent, the upper half red and the lower half blue, between the halves are two stripes in yellow and green. The official Centre for Indigenous People in Murmansk Province, under which the official Council of Indigenous Peoples under the [Provincial] Government operates, uses a logo also inspired by the flag: a circle, left half blue and right half red, at the centre of which is a brown lávvu, a blue line symbolizing water, and a multicoloured line symbolizing the Aurora Borealis, the colours of the latter being from left to right red, yellow, green and blue.
