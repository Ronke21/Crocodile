<text>Myoclonus is a brief, involuntary, irregular (lacking rhythm) of a muscle, a joint, or a group of muscles, different from clonus, which is rhythmic or regular. Myoclonus ( &quot;muscle&quot;, clonus &quot;spasm&quot;) describes a medical sign and, generally, is not a diagnosis of a disease. It belongs to the hyperkinetic movement disorders, among tremor and chorea for example. These myoclonic twitches, jerks, or seizures are usually caused by sudden muscle contractions (&quot;positive myoclonus&quot;) or brief lapses of contraction (&quot;negative myoclonus&quot;). The most common circumstance under which they occur is while falling asleep (hypnic jerk). Myoclonic jerks occur in healthy people and are experienced occasionally by everyone. However, when they appear with more persistence and become more widespread they can be a sign of various neurological disorders. Hiccups are a kind of myoclonic jerk specifically affecting the diaphragm. When a spasm is caused by another person it is known as a &quot;provoked spasm&quot;. Shuddering attacks in babies fall in this category.

Myoclonic jerks may occur alone or in sequence, in a pattern or without pattern. They may occur infrequently or many times each minute. Most often, myoclonus is one of several signs in a wide variety of nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dystonia, cerebral palsy, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Gaucher&#x27;s disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), serotonin toxicity, some cases of Huntington&#x27;s disease, some forms of epilepsy, and occasionally in intracranial hypotension.

In almost all instances in which myoclonus is caused by central nervous system disease it is preceded by other symptoms; for instance, in CJD it is generally a late-stage clinical feature that appears after the patient has already started to exhibit gross neurological deficits.

Anatomically, myoclonus may originate from lesions of the cortex, subcortex or spinal cord. The presence of myoclonus above the foramen magnum effectively excludes spinal myoclonus; further localisation relies on further investigation with electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG).

== Types ==
The most common types of myoclonus include action, cortical reflex, essential, palatal, those seen in the progressive myoclonus epilepsies, reticular reflex, sleep and stimulus-sensitive.

=== Epilepsy forms ===
* Cortical reflex myoclonus is thought to be a type of epilepsy that originates in the cerebral cortex – the outer layer, or &quot;gray matter&quot;, of the brain, responsible for much of the information processing that takes place in the brain. In this type of myoclonus, jerks usually involve only a few muscles in one part of the body, but jerks involving many muscles may occur. Cortical reflex myoclonus can be intensified when patients attempt to move in a certain way or perceive a particular sensation.
* Essential myoclonus occurs in the absence of epilepsy or other apparent abnormalities in the brain or nerves. It can occur randomly in people with no family history or among members of the same family, indicating that it sometimes may be an inherited disorder. Essential myoclonus tends to be stable without increasing in severity over time. Some scientists speculate that some forms of essential myoclonus may be a type of epilepsy with no known cause.
* Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) usually consists of jerking and muscle twitches of the upper extremities. This may include the arms, shoulders, elbows, and very rarely, the legs. JME is among the most common types of epilepsy and can affect one of every 14 people with the disease. These seizures typically occur shortly after waking up. Onset for JME can be seen around puberty for most patients. Administration of medications that also treat multiple seizure types is usually the most effective form of treatment.
* Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS), or childhood epileptic encephalopathy, is a rare epileptic disorder accounting for 1–4% of childhood epilepsies. The syndrome has much more severe symptoms ranging from multiple seizures daily, learning disabilities, and abnormal findings in electroencephalograms (EEG). Earlier age of seizure onset is correlated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment.
* Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) is a group of diseases characterized by myoclonus, epileptic seizures, tonic–clonic seizures, and other serious symptoms such as trouble walking or speaking. These rare disorders often get worse over time and can be fatal. Studies have identified at least three forms of PME. Lafora disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that the disease occurs only when a child inherits two copies of a defective gene, one from each parent. Lafora disease is characterized by myoclonus, epileptic seizures, and dementia (progressive loss of memory and other intellectual functions). A second group of PME diseases belonging to the class of cerebral storage diseases usually involves myoclonus, visual problems, dementia, and dystonia (sustained muscle contractions that cause twisting movements or abnormal postures). Another group of PME disorders in the class of system degenerations often is accompanied by action myoclonus, seizures, and problems with balance and walking. Many of these PME diseases begin in childhood or adolescence. Treatment is not normally successful for any extended period of time.
* Reticular reflex myoclonus is thought to be a type of generalized epilepsy that originates in the brainstem, the part of the brain that connects to the spinal cord and controls vital functions such as breathing and heartbeat. Myoclonic jerks usually affect the whole body, with muscles on both sides of the body affected simultaneously. In some people, myoclonic jerks occur in only a part of the body, such as the legs, with all the muscles in that part being involved in each jerk. Reticular reflex myoclonus can be triggered by either a voluntary movement or an external stimulus.

===Diaphragmatic flutter===
A very rare form includes the diaphragmatic flutter, the Belly Dancer&#x27;s Syndrome, or Van Leeuwenhoek&#x27;s disease. It was first described by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1723, who had it. The condition characterizes spoken communication that sounds like a short-breathed hiccup. These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day. Rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the average rate found to be 150. Studies show that possible causes include disruptions within the central or peripheral nervous systems, anxiety, nutritional disorder, and certain pharmaceuticals. No single treatment has proven effective, though blocking or crushing of the phrenic nerve can provide instantaneous relief when pharmacologic treatment has proven ineffective.

Only about 50 people in the world have been diagnosed with diaphragmatic flutter.

===Other forms===
* Action myoclonus is characterized by muscular jerking triggered or intensified by voluntary movement or even the intention to move. It may be made worse by attempts at precise, coordinated movements. Action myoclonus is the most disabling form of myoclonus and can affect the arms, legs, face, and even the voice. It is often associated with tonic-clonic seizures and diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although, in the case of focal cerebral damage, the disease may be restricted to one limb. This type of myoclonus often is caused by brain damage that results from a lack of oxygen and blood flow to the brain when breathing or heartbeat is temporarily stopped. Over-excitement of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus) is also a cause of action myoclonus. Serotonin and GABA neurotransmitters are thought to cause this lack of inhibition, which is a possible explanation as to why improvements are made with the administration of serotonin precursors. Systems involved include the cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar tracts, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers.
* Palatal myoclonus is a regular, rhythmic contraction of one or both sides of the rear of the roof of the mouth, called the soft palate. These contractions may be accompanied by myoclonus in other muscles, including those in the face, tongue, throat, and diaphragm. The contractions are very rapid, occurring as often as 150 times a minute, and may persist during sleep. The condition usually appears in adults and can last indefinitely. People with palatal myoclonus usually regard it as a minor problem; some complain of an occasional &quot;clicking&quot; sound, a noise made as the soft palate muscles contract.
* Middle ear myoclonus occurs in the muscles of the middle ear. These muscles may include the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles. It can involve the muscles surrounding the Eustachian tube, which include the tensor veli palatini, levator veli palatini, and salpingopharyngeus. Those affected describe it as a thumping sound or sensation in the ear.
* Spinal myoclonus is myoclonus originating in the spinal cord, including segmental and propriospinal myoclonus. The latter is usually due to a thoracic generator producing truncal flexion jerk. It is often stimulus-induced with a delay due to the slow conducting propriospinal nerve fibers.
* Stimulus-sensitive myoclonus is triggered by a variety of external events, including noise, movement, and light. Surprise may increase the sensitivity of the patient.
* Sleep myoclonus occurs during the initial phases of sleep, especially at the moment of dropping off to sleep, and include familiar examples of myoclonus such as the hypnic jerk. Some forms appear to be stimulus-sensitive. Some people with sleep myoclonus are rarely troubled by it, or need treatment. If it is a symptom of more complex and disturbing sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome, it may require medical treatment. Myoclonus can be associated with patients with Tourette syndrome.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Myoclonic seizure can be described as &quot;jumps&quot; or &quot;jolts&quot; experienced in a single or even the entire body. The feeling experienced by the individual is described as uncontrollable jolts common to receiving a mild electric shock. The sudden jerks and twitching of the body can often be so severe that it can cause a small child to fall.

A myoclonic seizure (&quot;myo&quot; &quot;muscle&quot;, &quot;clonic&quot; &quot;jerk&quot;) is a sudden involuntary contraction of muscle groups. The muscle jerks consist of symmetric, mostly generalized jerks, localized in the arms and in the shoulders and also simultaneously with a head nod; both the arms may fling out together and simultaneously a head nod may occur. Symptoms have some variability amongst subjects. Sometimes the entire body may jerk, just like a startle response. As is the case with all generalised seizures, the patient is not conscious during the event but the seizure is so brief that the person appears to remain fully conscious.

In reflex epilepsies, myoclonic seizures can be brought on by flashing lights or other environmental triggers (see photosensitive epilepsy).

Familiar examples of normal myoclonus include hiccups and hypnic jerks that some people experience while drifting off to sleep. Severe cases of pathologic myoclonus can distort movement and severely limit a person&#x27;s ability to sleep, eat, talk, and walk. Myoclonic jerks commonly occur in individuals with epilepsy.

== Cause ==
Myoclonus in healthy individuals may indicate nothing other than arbitrary muscle contraction. Myoclonus may also develop in response to infection, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, head or spinal cord injury, stroke, stress, brain tumors, kidney or liver failure, lipid storage disease, chemical or drug poisoning, as a side effect of certain drugs (such as tramadol, quinolones, benzodiazepine, gabapentin, sertraline, lamotrigine, opioids), or other disorders.

Benign myoclonic movements are commonly seen during the induction of general anesthesia with intravenous medications such as etomidate and propofol. These are postulated to result from decreased inhibitory signaling from cranial neurons. Prolonged oxygen deprivation to the brain, hypoxia, may result in posthypoxic myoclonus. People with benign fasciculation syndrome can often experience myoclonic jerking of limbs, fingers and thumbs.

Myoclonus can occur by itself, but most often as one of several symptoms associated with a variety of nervous system disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, opsoclonus myoclonus, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Lyme disease and lupus. Myoclonic jerks commonly occur in persons with epilepsy, a disorder in which the electrical activity in the brain becomes disordered leading to seizures. It is also found in MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers), a rare mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.

Jerks of muscle groups, much of the body, or a series in rapid succession, which results in the person jerking bolt upright from a more relaxed sitting position is sometimes seen in ambulatory patients being treated with high doses of morphine, hydromorphone, and similar drugs, and is possibly a sign of high and/or rapidly increasing serum levels of these drugs. Myoclonic jerks caused by other opioids, such as tramadol and pethidine, may be less benign. Medications unrelated to opioids, such as anticholinergics, are known to cause myoclonic jerks.

== Pathophysiology ==
Most myoclonus is caused by a disturbance of the central nervous system. Some are from peripheral nervous system injury. Studies suggest several locations in the brain are involved in myoclonus. One is in the brainstem, close to structures that are responsible for the startle response, an automatic reaction to an unexpected stimulus involving rapid muscle contraction.

The specific mechanisms underlying myoclonus are not yet fully understood. Scientists believe that some types of stimulus-sensitive myoclonus may involve overexcitability of the parts of the brain that control movement. These parts are interconnected in a series of feedback loops called motor pathways. These pathways facilitate and modulate communication between the brain and muscles. Key elements of this communication are chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which carry messages from one nerve cell, or neuron, to another. Neurotransmitters are released by neurons and attach themselves to receptors on parts of neighboring cells. Some neurotransmitters may make the receiving cell more sensitive, while others tend to make the receiving cell less sensitive. Laboratory studies suggest that an imbalance between these chemicals may underlie myoclonus.

Some researchers speculate that abnormalities or deficiencies in the receptors for certain neurotransmitters may contribute to some forms of myoclonus. Receptors that appear to be related to myoclonus include those for two important inhibitory neurotransmitters: serotonin, which constricts blood vessels and brings on sleep, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps the brain maintain muscle control. Other receptors with links to myoclonus include those for glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is important for the control of motor and sensory functions in the spinal cord, and those affected by benzodiazepines, a variety of medication that usually induces sleep. More research is needed to determine how these receptor abnormalities cause or contribute to myoclonus.

== Treatment ==
Concerning more serious conditions, the complex origins of myoclonus may be treated with multiple drugs, which have a limited effect individually, but greater when combined with others that act on different brain pathways or mechanisms. Treatment is most effective when the underlying cause is known, and can be treated as such. Some drugs being studied in different combinations include clonazepam, sodium valproate, piracetam, and primidone. Hormonal therapy may improve responses to antimyoclonic drugs in some people.

Some studies have shown that doses of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) leads to improvement in patients with some types of action myoclonus and PME. These differences in the effect of 5-HTP on patients with myoclonus have not yet been explained.

Many of the drugs used for myoclonus, such as barbiturates, phenytoin and primidone, are also used to treat epilepsy. Barbiturates slow down the central nervous system and cause tranquilizing or antiseizure effects. Phenytoin and primidone are effective antiepileptics drugs, although phenytoin can cause liver failure or have other harmful long-term effects in patients with PME. Sodium valproate is an alternative therapy for myoclonus and can be used either alone or in combination with clonazepam. Some people have adverse reactions to clonazepam and/or sodium valproate.

When patients are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus and treatment of metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes this leads to the mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.

In forms of myoclonus where only a single area is affected, and even in a few other various forms, Botox injections (OnabotulinumtoxinA) may be helpful. The chemical messenger responsible for triggering the involuntary muscle contractions is blocked by the Botulinum toxins of the Botox.

Surgery is also a viable option for treatment if the symptoms are caused by a tumor or lesion in the brain or spinal cord. Surgery may also correct symptoms in those where myoclonus affects parts of the face or ear. While DBS is still being studied for use with myoclonus, Deep Brain Stimulation has also been tried in those with this and other movement disorders.

== Prognosis ==
The effects of myoclonus in an individual can vary depending on the form and the overall health of the individual. In severe cases, particularly those indicating an underlying disorder in the brain or nerves, movement can be extremely distorted and limit ability to normally function, such as in eating, talking, and walking. In these cases, treatment that is usually effective, such as clonazepam and sodium valproate, may instead cause adverse reaction to the drug, including increased tolerance and a greater need for increase in dosage. However, the prognosis for more simple forms of myoclonus in otherwise healthy individuals may be neutral, as the disease may cause few to no difficulties. Other times the disease starts simply, in one region of the body, and then spreads.

== Research ==
Research on myoclonus is supported through the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The primary focus of research is on the role of neurotransmitters and receptors involved in the disease. Identifying whether or not abnormalities in these pathways cause myoclonus may help in efforts to develop drug treatments and diagnostic tests. Determining the extent that genetics play in these abnormalities may lead to potential treatments for their reversal, potentially correcting the loss of inhibition while enhancing mechanisms in the body that would compensate for their effects.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;myoclonus&quot; uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; and &quot;clonus&quot;, indicating muscle contraction dysfunction. It is pronounced or . The prevalence of the variants shows division between American English and British English. The variant stressing the &quot;-oc-&quot; syllable is the only pronunciation given in a half dozen major American dictionaries (medical and general). The variant stressing the &quot;-clo-&quot; syllable is given in the British English module of Oxford Dictionaries online but not in the American English module.

<doc id="650837" wikidata="Q1475090" url="?curid=650837" title="Horizon-class frigate">
<text>The Horizon class (French: Classe Horizon; Italian: Classe Orizzonte) is a class of air-defence destroyers in service with the French and Italian navies. They are designated as destroyers by the Italians and are referred to as &quot;frigates&quot; by the French but nonetheless also use the NATO classification &quot;D&quot; intended for destroyers. The programme started as the Common New Generation Frigate (CNGF), a three-nation collaboration between France, the United Kingdom, and Italy to develop a new generation of air-defence warships. Differing national requirements, workshare disagreements and delays led to the UK withdrawing from the project in 1999 to develop the Type 45 destroyer.

The FREMM multipurpose frigate were built using the same company structure as the Horizon project.

==Development==

France, Italy, and the UK issued a joint requirement in 1992 after the failure of the NATO Frigate Replacement for the 90s (NFR-90) project. In July 1993, the three countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a Common New Generation Frigate (CNGF). The ships were to be armed with the Principal Anti Air Missile System (PAAMS). The UK intended to purchase twelve ships to replace its Type 42 destroyers. France was to purchase four to replace its , and Italy would purchase six to replace its and ships.

Problems emerged almost immediately. The primary problem was that of differing requirements: France wanted anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) escorts for its aircraft carriers, but only a limited range was necessary due to the self-defence capability of the French . Italy too required only close-range capabilities, as in its home waters of the Mediterranean Sea the ships would operate under Italian Air Force cover or escorts for its aircraft carrier . The Royal Navy, however, required more capable ships which could throw a large defensive &quot;bubble&quot; over a fleet operating in hostile areas. The compromise that largely solved this problem was the adoption of a standard radar interface, which allowed France and Italy to install the EMPAR multi-function passive electronically scanned array radar and the UK to install the more capable SAMPSON active electronically scanned array radar—the SAMPSON radar has a higher data rate and an adaptive beam that allows a greater ability to track multiple targets, long-range detection of low-RCS targets, a lower false-alarm rate, and overall higher tracking accuracy.

In March 1996, it was agreed that the PAAMS office would be based in Paris, and the Project Horizon project office would be based in London. The latter was to be responsible for the design of the ship, its command and control, and secondary weapons systems. Britain also agreed to contribute £100m in recognition of the development work already completed by Italy and France on PAAMS. Construction would be carried out by DCN (France), GEC-Marconi (UK), and Orizzonte (Italy).

===UK withdrawal===
On 26 April 1999, the UK announced that it was withdrawing from the CNGF project to pursue its own national design. At this point, the CNGF project was five years behind schedule. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; summarised the main disagreements between the partner countries:
* Vessel size – As noted above, the UK&#x27;s requirements were out of step with those of France and Italy. An agreement was reached but the Financial Times reported that the issue &quot;never entirely [went] away.&quot;
* Capability – The UK wanted the ships with a wide-area defence capability due to its experience in the Falklands War.
* Industrial structure – The UK tried to use its larger requirement to exert influence; the UK&#x27;s desire to see Marconi appointed as prime contractor was accepted by France, but only in return for DCN being given the role as prime contractor for the combat management system. The UK, which wished to see a British Aerospace-led consortium given this role, would not accept this.

The resulting Type 45 destroyer is armed with the PAAMS missile system and has benefited from investment in the Horizon project.

===Franco-Italian project===

France and Italy continued their collaboration under the Horizon project. In September 2000, the two countries signed a contract to jointly produce four ships, ordering two ships each which would deploy the PAAMS missile system. The Italian Navy ordered two units, and , to replace the &quot;Audace&quot; class. &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was accepted on 22 December 2007 and received the flag of the Italian Navy. Full operation capability was achieved in the summer of 2008. The French Navy ordered two units, and , to replace the &quot;Suffren&quot;-class carrier escorts. The project cost France €2.16bn (~US$3bn) at 2009 prices. A further two Horizons were cancelled; instead, the two s were to be replaced by the FREDA air-defence variant of the Franco-Italian FREMM multipurpose frigate (later known as and ). France bought 40 Aster 15 and 80 Aster 30 missiles for their ships. On the Italian units, the three cannons will be upgraded to the 76 mm/62 Super Rapid Multi Feeding David/Strales version with the capacity to use the DART guided projectile in the anti-missile role.

<doc id="650838" wikidata="Q7916882" url="?curid=650838" title="Vasopressin analogue">
<text>Vasopressin analogues are synthetic peptides structurally and functionally similar to arginine vasopressin (AVP), a naturally occurring hormone in mammals. These compounds have been developed to target specific vasopressin receptors (V1, V2, and V3) with varying affinities, allowing for more tailored therapeutic applications. These analogues have been developed to address limitations of endogenous vasopressin, such as short half-life and lack of receptor selectivity, and to potentially reduce side effects associated with non-selective vasopressin receptor activation.

== Medical uses ==

The most prominent vasopressin analogues include desmopressin (dDAVP), terlipressin, and selepressin, each with distinct pharmacological profiles and clinical uses. Desmopressin, a V2 receptor agonist, is primarily used for treating diabetes insipidus and certain bleeding disorders. Terlipressin, with higher V1 receptor selectivity, has found applications in managing variceal bleeding and hepatorenal syndrome. Selepressin, a selective V1 receptor agonist, has been investigated for its potential in treating septic shock.

== Research ==

Ongoing research continues to explore the therapeutic potential of vasopressin analogues in various clinical conditions, particularly in the management of shock states and fluid balance disorders.

They are also used in cirrhosis patients.

<doc id="650839" wikidata="Q426866" url="?curid=650839" title="Charles Seymour Whitman">
<text>Charles Seymour Whitman (September 29, 1868March 29, 1947) was an American lawyer who served as the 41st governor of New York from January 1, 1915, to December 31, 1918. An attorney and politician, he also served as a delegate from New York to the 1916 Republican National Convention. He had previously served as deputy and New York County District Attorney, in addition to state judge.

==Early life, education and career==
Whitman was born in Hanover, Connecticut on September 29, 1868, the son of John Seymour Whitman (1833–1909) and Olivia (née Arne) Whitman (1831–1904).

He graduated from Amherst College in 1890. Whitman studied law at New York University School of Law where he graduated in 1894. He was admitted to the bar later that year, and set up a practice in New York City.

== Career ==
In 1901, he was appointed assistant corporation counsel of New York County, New York. He was next elected as city magistrate. In this capacity, he founded the Night Court for the immediate trial of all offenders arrested at night.

In 1907, Governor Charles Evans Hughes appointed Whitman as a judge of the Court of Sessions. The following year Hughes appointed him as deputy state attorney general in the investigation of election frauds in northern New York.

===New York County District Attorney===
In 1909, Whitman was elected as New York County District Attorney on a Fusion ticket. In this capacity, he secured representation of the District Attorney&#x27;s staff in the city magistrate&#x27;s office. He was also known for his vigorous prosecution of arson offenders, which contributed to a decline in such fires.

As District Attorney, Whitman gained national fame in prosecuting New York City Police Lt. Charles Becker for the July 16, 1912, murder of Herman Rosenthal, a Times Square gambling house operator, in front of the Hotel Metropole on West 43rd Street. The building was owned by &quot;Big Tim&quot; Sullivan, a leader of the Lower East Side Tammany Hall political machine.

During this period, Whitman used his membership in the Union League Club of New York to conduct secret interviews there of witnesses during the Becker case, as he feared he was under surveillance. Whitman&#x27;s prosecution revealed the corrupt relations between certain members of the New York City police and professional criminals, and resulted in reforms of the police. Becker was convicted in a jury trial and sentenced to death. Later, as governor, Whitman signed Becker&#x27;s death warrant and presided over his electrocution. 
Whitman&#x27;s handling of the murder case of Hans Schmidt, a priest, and his prosecution of the poultry trust and of election frauds also gained him high praise. After being renominated for District Attorney in 1913, he was elected almost unanimously.

===Governor of New York===

Whitman was elected in 1914 as the 41st Governor of New York, serving from January 1915 to December 1918. His principal plank was the reformation of the state finances. He reorganized state departments and conducted a thorough investigation of the salaries of civil service employees.

In 1915, he became a member of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. This lineage society was based on descent from men who had served with the patriots in the revolution.

In 1916, Whitman won re-election as governor against reform Democrat Judge Samuel Seabury. After his election, he sent a report of his first term as governor to every registered voter; it included reports of the heads of his state departments. He also inaugurated a state constabulary.

After the United States entered into World War I, Whitman established a new state guard to replace the National Guard, which was on service in France. In 1916, he was elected as chairman of the Republican National Convention, where he urged the nomination of former New York Governor Hughes for President of the United States. In 1917, he commissioned the creation of the New York State Police and selected George Fletcher Chandler, a physician and major in the National Guard, to organize and head the force.

In 1918, Whitman was defeated for re-election by Democrat Al Smith (then President of the New York City Board of Aldermen and associated with Tammany Hall). Smith drew from the growing strength of recent immigrants and their descendants.

==Personal life==
In 1908, Whitman was married to Olive Hitchcock (1880–1928). Together, they were the parents of:

* Olive Whitman
* Charles S. Whitman Jr, (1915–2002), who was a New York Judge.

After the death of his first wife in 1928, in 1933 he married Thelma Somerville (née Cudlipp) Grosvenor (1891–1983), the widow of Edwin Prescott Grosvenor, himself the son of Edwin A. Grosvenor (1845–1936) and brother of Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor.

He died on March 29, 1947, in Manhattan.

==Legacy==
His portrait was painted in 1921 by the Swiss-born American portrait painter Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) and is the property of the New York State Capitol at Albany; Müller-Ury had previously painted a portrait of his baby daughter, Olive (the future Mrs Parsons), which was much admired when exhibited, and was given by her to the Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island, where it now hangs at Green Animals.

===Literary treatment===

Whitman is a character in E.L. Doctorow&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Ragtime&quot; (although he does not figure significantly in the later film based on the novel).

===Descendants===
His grandson, former First Gentleman of New Jersey John Russell Whitman (1944–2015), married Christine Todd (b. 1946), who served as a Republican Governor of New Jersey and Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

<doc id="650846" wikidata="Q7884355" url="?curid=650846" title="Unfinished portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt">
<text>The unfinished portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt is a watercolor of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the United States, by Elizabeth Shoumatoff. Shoumatoff was commissioned to paint a portrait of Roosevelt and started her work around noon on April 12, 1945. At lunch, Roosevelt complained of a headache and subsequently collapsed. The president, who had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, died later that day.

Shoumatoff never finished the portrait, but she later painted a new, largely identical one, based on memory. The unfinished portrait hangs at Roosevelt&#x27;s retreat, the Little White House, in Warm Springs, Georgia, with its finished counterpart beside it.

==History==
In 1943, Shoumatoff was told by her friend and client Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd, who was also the President&#x27;s mistress:

Rutherfurd would go on to make the arrangements, with Shoumatoff agreeing to sit in for two days within two weeks&#x27; time. She said of the agreement: &quot;I was trapped into something I had neither wished for nor planned.&quot; She went on to talk about not being able to turn down the honor of being selected for a presidential commission.

==Painting==

Elizabeth Shoumatoff had begun working on the portrait of the president around noon on April 12, 1945. Roosevelt was being served lunch when he said &quot;I have a terrific headache.&quot; He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president&#x27;s attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Roosevelt never regained consciousness and died at 3:35 p.m. that day. Shoumatoff never finished the portrait.

The unfinished portrait hangs at Roosevelt&#x27;s former health and relaxation retreat in Warm Springs, Georgia, known as the Little White House.

Later, Shoumatoff decided to finish the portrait in Roosevelt&#x27;s memory. She created a new painting based on memory. One difference is that the tie that was red in the original is blue in the finished painting. All other aspects are completely identical. The finished portrait resides in the Legacy Exhibit beside the original at the Little White House Historic Site in Warm Springs.

<doc id="650847" wikidata="Q7432840" url="?curid=650847" title="Schreck Ensemble">
<text>The Schreck Ensemble is a Dutch new music ensemble specializing in electroacoustic music, established in 1989. The name is a combination of the surnames of the founders – composers Arie van Schutterhoef and Hans van Eck – a reference to the actor Max Schreck. They also program their own software with the SuperCollider programming language, and develop their own hardware for the production and performance of electroacoustic music.

The Schreck Ensemble has commissioned electroacoustic compositions by Arthur Sauer, Gene Carl, Gerda Geertens, Jeremy Arden, Michael Chocholak, and Makoto Shinohara, and has performed works by Kaija Saariaho, John Cage, Jean-Claude Risset and Chiel Meyering. The ensemble also performs multimedia works. &quot;Aquae Supracoelestes&quot; for tape and video-projection and &quot;Nuctemeron&quot; for ensemble, tape, and video-projection are two examples.

==Software==
Schreck develops software that can create sounds that do not exist in nature and modify those that do. It is also used to emulate sounds generated by obsolete electronic equipment.

Their software also attempts to expand the relationship between acoustic instruments and the computer. An example of this is a score-following program called &quot;ComParser&quot;. The program determines which part of the music is being played and initiates pre-programmed sequences of sound processors at the appropriate times. ComParser follows the tempo of the musician. ComParser is not a &quot;pitch-follower&quot;, but a &quot;spectrum-follower&quot;.

==Instruments==
Three instruments have been designed by the Schreck-Ensemble: the Stratifier, the BassBox, and the Pulsor.

===The Stratifier===
The Stratifier is a small instrument (10 x 30 x 40 cm) with twelve touch sensitive control-surfaces that send signals to sound processing equipment.

===The BassBox===
The BassBox is an acoustic instrument. The sound of this instrument is created by the overblowing of two flutes that obtain their air from a large fast-moving bass speaker. The sound does not resemble the sound of a flute but that of a wooden percussion instrument with many overtones. The instrument can be heard in the composition &quot;The Day&quot;.

===The Pulsor===
The Pulsor is under development. The Pulsor makes it possible to play the BassBox live allowing greater manipulation of the bass speaker than with the prerecorded sounds. The Pulsor also enables the BassBox to be played with the Stratifier.

==Collaborations==
The Schreck Ensemble has collaborated with many institutes and organizations inside and outside of the Netherlands including the &quot;European Network&quot; (Foundation Gaudeamus/Associazone Nuove Sincronie in Milan, Italy); studios for electronic music &quot;STEIM&quot; and &quot;CEM&quot; in Amsterdam; The Netherlands; &quot;tART&quot; (technology and art) -organization of the University Twente in Enschede, the Netherlands; &quot;Danish Institute for Electro-acoustic Music&quot; (DIEM) at Aarhus, Denmark, and the &quot;Centro Ricerche Musicali&quot; in Rome.

Their repertoire includes a song called &quot;The Day&quot;, which is a collaboration between the Schreck Ensemble and the sound artist Hans van Koolwijk featuring his instrument, the Bambuso Sonore.

==Appearances==
The Schreck Ensemble performed for the first time in 1989 at the then-renowned art center Apollohuis in Eindhoven. Since that time, the Ensemble has performed in major venues for contemporary music in the Netherlands and abroad, including the Music Centre Vredenburg. Utrecht; the Grote Kerk, Groningen; Dodorama, Rotterdam; the Ruïne Kerk, Bergen, North Holland; Theater Frascati, Amsterdam; Music Centre Frits Philips, Eindhoven; Theatre Kikker, Utrecht; Theatre Provadja, Alkmaar; the Music Centre, IJsbreker, Amsterdam; the Stedelijk Museum for Modern Art. Amsterdam; and the Music Centre, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

===Festivals===
The Schreck Ensemble has played at several festivals including:

*&quot;November Music Festival&quot; in Den Bosch and Gent
*&quot;Distronics Festival&quot; in Eindhoven
*&quot;Sounds Imagined, Images Sonified&quot; near Castle Eijsden at Limburg
*&quot;Touch Festival Amsterdam&quot; organized by &quot;STEIM&quot;.

Abroad, the ensemble was invited to be the ensemble-in-residence during the &quot;Studienwoche fr Neue Musik&quot; in Lneburg, Germany to which it later returned to appear in the &quot;Festival für Neue Musik&quot;. Schreck also played at the &quot;MIX01 Festival&quot; in Aarhus, Denmark; at the Festival &#x27;Musica Scienza, Teatro dell&#x27; Ascolto&#x27; in Rome, Italy; on invitation of the cultural board of the regional government of Andaluca. Schreck participated in the &quot;Contemporary Music Concert Series&quot; in &quot;Theatro Central&quot; in Sevilla; and in the &quot;XIV Contemporary Music Days&quot; in &quot;Teatro Alhambra&quot; in Granada, Spain.

===Abroad===
Other countries where the Schreck Ensemble has appeared include:
* Germany, particularly in Essen (Kunsthaus Essen) and Lüneburg (Glockenhaus)
* Spain at the Granada Teatro Alhambra and the Sevilla Teatro Central
* Italy at the Goethe-Institute and the Sassari Teatro Il Ferroviario
* Belgium at the Logos Tetrahedron (Ghent)
* Denmark at the Aarhus Musikhuset.

===Radio===
Radio broadcasts of the Schreck Ensemble have been broadcast by the Dutch stations KRO, the VPRO, and the ConcertZender. Outside the Netherlands there were similar programs in Australia (Difficult Listening), Russia, and Denmark.

===Videoworks===
The video-work made by Schreck was shown during the &quot;7th International Festival of New Film&quot;, Split-Croatia in the new media section; at the &quot;Sas International Award 2003&quot; festival in Catania, Italy - organized by the United Nations - in the category Digital Wave for experimental movies and video-art; and selected for the &quot;Slowtime? ... Quicktime as an artistic medium&quot; as an example for streaming media. This appearance was organized by Agricola de Cologne experimental platform for Internet art.

<doc id="650849" wikidata="Q19868" url="?curid=650849" title="Montferrat">
<text>Montferrat ( , ; ; , ; ) is a historical region of Piedmont, in northern Italy. It comprises roughly (and its extent has varied over time) the modern provinces of Alessandria and Asti. Montferrat is one of the most important wine districts of Italy. It also has a strong literary tradition, including the 18th-century Asti-born poet and dramatist Vittorio Alfieri and the Alessandrian Umberto Eco.

The territory is cut in two by the river Tanaro. The northern part (the Basso Monferrato, &quot;Low Montferrat&quot;), which lies between that river and the Po, is an area of rolling hills and plains. The southern part (the Alto Monferrato, &quot;High Montferrat&quot;) rises from the banks of the Tanaro into the mountains of the Apennines and the water divide between Piedmont and Liguria.

On 22 June 2014, Montferrat was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==
Originally a county, it was elevated to a margravate of the Holy Roman Empire under Count Aleramo in 961, following the transition of power in northern Italy from Berengar of Ivrea to Otto I of Germany. Its &quot;marchesi&quot; (marquesses) and their family members were related to the Kings of France and the Holy Roman Emperors. Members of the family participated frequently in the Crusades, and intermarried with the royal family of Jerusalem and the Byzantine Imperial families of Comnenus, Angelus and Palaeologus. The March of Montferrat was briefly controlled by Spain (1533–1536) before it passed to the Gonzaga Dukes of Mantua (1536–1708). In 1574, Montferrat was raised to a Duchy by Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. With the War of the Mantuan Succession (1628–1631) a piece of the duchy passed to the Duchy of Savoy, the remainder passing to Savoy in 1708, as Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor gained possession of the Gonzaga territory. The next heir of the House of Gonzaga was later compensated by giving Duchy of Teschen in Silesia to them.
==Etymology==
There are various interpretations and assumptions concerning the etymology of &quot;Montferrat&quot;, but to date none are certain. There are many opinions, with Aldo Ricaldone stating the name was derived from &quot;Mount&quot; and — a variety of wheat. Another claim is that it comes from the Latin meaning &quot;fertile and rich mountain&quot;. Still another refers to the irons (Latin ) left by the Romans in their conquest, . Finally, an interpretation derived from a legend according to which Aleramo of Montferrat, the legendary founder of its march, wanting to shoe a horse, and not finding a hammer, used a brick ( in the local dialect of Piedmontese), and thereby the horse was shod (, deriving from the same mentioned above), hence the name yielding &quot;Montferrat&quot;.

==Geography==

Montferrat can be divided into three main parts:
* Basso Monferrato (low Montferrat) or Casalese is characterized by its soft hills, to the exclusion of the Sacred Mount of Crea (455 m) (Unesco World Heritage), never reach heights of over 400 meters; territorially includes part of the province of Alessandria consisting of the countryside near Casale Monferrato. It is bounded on the north and east by the rivers Po and Tanaro.
* Monferrato Astigiano (Astesan Montferrat): Identifies virtually the entire Province of Asti (with the exception of Langa Astigiana) and is characterized by a hilly conformation and several historic towns such as Nizza Monferrato, Cortanze, Cocconato, Montiglio and Canelli. Asti is the geographical heart of this macro-region, bordered on the south by the valley of the river Belbo and west roughly from the path of the stream Versa and whose right side Asti is located. The highest point of the area is the hill of Albugnano 549 metres above sea level.
* Alto Monferrato (high Montferrat): extending south from the Val Bormida up to lick the foot of the Ligurian region, is bounded to the west by the valley of the Bormida Spigno and east by the western portion of the middle valley Scrivia. The main centre is Acqui Terme.

==Geology==
20 million years ago the Alps were formed, in the Mediterranean area producing a new rising heat from the Earth&#x27;s mantle which resulted in the buckle and rupture of the European crust which detached the Sardinian-Course block, the micro Sardinian plate did pin on the Ligurian Gulf executing a counterclockwise rotation of 50° and forming the Ligurian Sea. The sea covered the hill of Turin, the Langhe, Montferrat and the Po Valley. The rotation of the Corsica-Sardinia block opposed by the African block produced a pressure that gave rise to the Apennines. 8 million years ago to the east of the Corsica-Sardinia block opened a wide north–south divide that separated the Italian peninsula from Corsica and Sardinia, this gap widened to become the Tyrrhenian Sea. In the period from 7 to 5 million years ago, the Mediterranean Sea was closed and remained isolated from the Atlantic Ocean. This resulted in the increase of the temperature of the water that turned the Mediterranean into a low-salt lake with many areas dried up, this condition lasted for several hundreds of thousands of years was deposited sediment-type saline evaporites. Subsequently, the Mediterranean Sea was opened, and the ocean water began to circulate between the Alps and the Apennines had formed a triangular gulf that covered the entire Po Valley. Due to the continuous lifting of the Alps and the Apennines to the sea withdrew from this gulf and the accumulation of sediments carried by the rivers gave rise to a flood plain which corresponds to the Po Valley. The marine deposits of this period are visible in the area of Asti.

==Economy==

Monferrato is one of the most famous Italian wine regions in the world, especially regarding red wines and sparkling wines. The climate is dry continental with hot summers prone to drought and cold winters and the particular hydrogeological soil is favourable for viticulture, which, however, is dominant throughout, making the wine not only an element of economic wealth for the entire region but also a true symbol of the culture and tradition &quot;Monferrina&quot;. The widespread dissemination of indigenous grapes and consequently a wide variety of wines witnesses them. Among the wines (DOC and DOCG), the most famous are Barbera d&#x27;Asti, Asti spumante, Moscato d&#x27;Asti, Cortese, Malvasia, and Grignolino.

The Monferrato, together with Alba, is also known for the production of truffles; there are many fairs in this trade, for example, the regional fair of truffles held in Montechiaro d&#x27;Asti.

==Culture==
===Cuisine===
The traditional cuisine of Montferrat, in addition to the award-winning wines, includes a wide variety of foods ranging from meat, fish, vegetables, and cheeses. Typical Monferrato dishes, which have now achieved a reputation not only nationally but also internationally include, among the first courses, agnolotti &quot;al plin&quot; (literally &quot;pinched&quot;), &quot;Tajarin&quot; (noodles for rich eggs seasoned with various sauces), risotto of Casale, rice with mushrooms and red wine, vegetable soups, polenta with fried cod or &quot;loan&quot;. Worthy of mention and especially well-known is Bagna càuda. Among the meats are tripe, paws (batciuà), chickpeas with head, oxtail (now cooked with Barbera) and the cooked sausage.

===Literature===
In the second half of the 15th century stands in the field of dialect literature Gian Giorgio Allioni of Asti, poet, playwright and writer who knew poetry in French and Italian, wrote several farces in dialect, expressing &quot;an Astezan&quot; and provided a vivid picture of customs and life of the period and the Italian theatre of the 16th century, often steeped in satire and mockery. It was not until the 18th century to find two other versifiers Monferrato dialect that is the prior Incisa and Captain Joseph Stefano della Rocca, while in more recent times and in the 19th century that stands out the most famous Angelo Brofferio, politician, journalist and deputy linked to the Risorgimento, who wrote songs in dialect, plays and works of history.

===Art===

Artists active in the Montferrat include Gian Martino Spanzotti of Casale and Andrea Pozzo, Renaissance painter and architect active in the 17th century, the painter Pier Francesco Guala; Macrino d&#x27;Alba, a contemporary of Spanzotti, whose works are in private and public collections in the United States and Turin. His most important works can, however, identify a triptych housed in the castle of Camino, a &quot;Madonna Enthroned&quot; kept in the Sanctuary of the Sacro Monte di Crea, another &quot;Madonna&quot; in the church of St. John the Baptist to Alba and a &quot;Marriage of St. Catherine&quot; that adorns the church of Neviglie in the Langhe. Guglielmo Caccia, nicknamed &quot;The Moncalvo&quot;, executed works such as a &quot;Redeemer&quot; statue from the Museum of Asti and &quot;Resurrection&quot; in the cathedral; several of his paintings can be found in the parishes of Grazzano Badoglio, Villadeati, Casale Monferrato, San Salvatore Monferrato, Moncalvo and Castagnito.

===Architecture===
The architecture flourished in Montferrat from the year 1000 onwards and is clearly visible in the numerous buildings, churches, castles and palaces of various periods many of which are still well preserved. Architecture was influenced by current Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance trends, before becoming, from the 17th century onwards, a current of Piedmontese Baroque. Architects who worked in Montferrat include Benedetto Alfieri (1707-1767) of Asti, considered the successor to Filippo Juvarra, and Francesco Gallo (1672-1750) of Mondovì, as well as Francesco Ottavio Magnocavalli, born in Casale Monferrato.

====Sacred Mount of Crea====
The Sacred Mountain of Crea (Italian: &quot;Sacro Monte di Crea&quot;) is a Roman Catholic sanctuary in the &quot;comune&quot; of Serralunga di Crea (Montferrat), near Alessandria. It is one of the nine Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy, included in UNESCO World Heritage list.

Its construction was begun in 1589, around a former Sanctuary of St. Mary whose creation is traditionally attributed to St. Eusebius, who first Christianized the site around 350 AD.

<text>Viola hirta is a species of the plant genus &quot;Viola&quot;. It is also called the hairy violet. As with the sweet violet, no fossil seeds of this species have been found. It is confined to the cold temperate zone, in Europe, north and west Asia, extending as far as northwest India. It is absent in Wales from Brecon and Radnor, Pembroke, Cardigan, Merioneth, and from Mid Lancs, and the Isle of Man, but elsewhere it is universal. In Scotland it does not occur in Roxburgh, Berwick, Haddington, Edinburgh, Fife, Forfar, Kincardine. From Forfar it ranges to the south of England, and is found at a height of 1000 ft. in Yorks. It occurs also in Ireland.

==Location==
The hairy violet is found on dry banks, and in woods, preferring drier conditions. It may be found in damper areas in woods in low-lying situations. This species has a less wide range than sweet violet (&quot;Viola odorata&quot;). Note it is considered by some sources to be the same species as &quot;Viola odorata&quot;.

==Habit==
The habit is prostrate like that of the sweet violet, which also has no erect stem, the leaves arising from the rootstock directly. The leaves are likewise heart-shaped, but in this case the stoles or trailing stems with buds are absent or very short, and the bracts are below the middle of the flower-stalk. Moreover, the whole plant is hairy, or roughly hairy, giving it a greyer, less green, appearance when dry.

<text>Viola odorata is a species of flowering plant in the family &quot;Violaceae&quot; native to Eurasia. The small hardy herbaceous perennial is commonly known as wood violet, sweet violet, English violet, common violet, florist&#x27;s violet, or garden violet.

==Description ==
&quot;Viola odorata&quot; spreads with stolons (above-ground shoots). The plant reaches in height. The leaves and flowers are all in a basal rosette, and the leaf stalks have downward-pointing hairs. The leaves are kidney-shaped and reach long. The flowers are normally either dark violet or white and are scented. The style is hooked (and does not end with a rounded appendage). The perennial flowers mature when the plant is at a height of and a spread of .

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Viola odorata&quot; is native to Europe south of Scandinavia, northwest Africa (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), Macaronesia, the Caucasus, Western Asia, and Kazakhstan. It has been introduced to the Americas, Scandinavia, southern and eastern Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

The species can be found near the edges of forests or in clearings; it is also a common &quot;uninvited guest&quot; in shaded lawns or elsewhere in gardens.

==Subspecies==
Two subspecies are accepted.
*&quot;Viola odorata&quot; subsp. &quot;odorata&quot; – entire range
*&quot;Viola odorata&quot; subsp. &quot;stolonifera&quot; – Balearic Islands

=== Chemistry ===
The plant contains the alkaloid violin, about 30 cyclotides, and triterpenoids, mostly as constituents of the essential oil.

==Uses==
Several cultivars have been selected for garden use, of which &quot;V. odorata&quot; &#x27;Wellsiana&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The sweet scent of this flower has proved popular, particularly in the late Victorian period, and has consequently been used in the production of many cosmetic fragrances and perfumes. There is some doubt as to whether the true extract of the violet flower is still used commercially in perfumes. It was still used in the early 20th century, but by the time Steffen Arctander was writing in the late 1950s and early 1960s, production had &quot;almost disappeared&quot;. Violet leaf absolute, however, remains widely used in modern perfumery.

The scent of violet flowers is distinctive with only a few other flowers having a remotely similar odor. References to violets and the desirable nature of the fragrance go back to classical sources such as Pliny and Horace when the name &quot;Ion&quot; was in use to describe this flower from which the name of the distinctive chemical constituents of the flower, the ionones, is derived. In 1923, W.A. Poucher wrote that the flowers were widely cultivated both in Europe and the East for their fragrance, with both the flowers and leaves being separately collected and extracted for fragrance, and flowers also collected for use in confectionery syrup and in the production of medicine.

The leaves and flowers are edible. Real violet flower extract is available for culinary uses, especially in European countries. The French are known for their violet syrup, most commonly made from an extract of violets. In the United States, this French violet syrup is used to make violet scones and marshmallows.

The plant contains a cannabinoid peptide called &quot;vodo-C1&quot; that acts in vitro as a selective CB2 receptor agonist without CB1 activity.

==In culture==
The violet flower was a favorite in ancient Greece and became the symbol of Athens. The scent suggested sex, so the violet was an emblematic flower of Aphrodite and of her son, Priapus, the deity of gardens and generation.

Iamus was a son of Apollo and the nymph Evadne. He was abandoned by his mother at birth. She left him lying in the Arkadian wilds on a bed of violets where he was fed honey by serpents. Eventually, he was discovered by passing shepherds who named him Iamus after the violet (&quot;ion&quot;) bed.

The goddess Persephone and her companion Nymphs were gathering rose, crocus, violet, iris, lily, and larkspur blooms in a springtime meadow when she was abducted by the god Hades.

<text>U.S. Route 466 (US 466) was an east–west United States highway. Though it reached a length of around 500 miles (805 km), the route was co-signed with other US routes for much of its length. When California deleted most of its U.S. Highways in the mid-1960s, including US 466 in 1964, there was no longer a need for the designation.

The general route between Barstow and Kingman is now more directly served by Interstate 40.

The route is known for being the highway on which actor James Dean died in a car accident on September 30, 1955, at the intersection of CA 41 near Cholame, California.

==Route description==
===California===

US 466 began in Morro Bay, continuing to US 101 before turning north and following the path of today&#x27;s SR 41 to Shandon in San Luis Obispo County. From there, US 466 followed the path of today&#x27;s SR 46 east. At Famoso, US 466 joined US 99 and ran south to Bakersfield. From Bakersfield, U.S. Route 466 generally followed what is now the alignment of SR 58. Between Barstow, California and the Nevada line, the route followed the path of today&#x27;s Interstate 15 and was co-signed with U.S. Route 91.

===Nevada===
U.S. Route 466 entered Nevada at Primm. It headed north concurrent with U.S. Route 91 to Las Vegas, where the route followed Las Vegas Boulevard. In downtown Las Vegas, US 466 turned east on Fremont Street with U.S. Route 93 (and later, U.S. Route 95). The two routes followed Fremont Street and Boulder Highway heading southeast through Henderson and Boulder City towards the Arizona state line on Hoover Dam.

===Arizona===
From the Nevada state line on Hoover Dam, U.S. Route 466 remained co-signed with US 93 as it headed southeast. At Grasshopper Junction, US 66 / US 466 served the western terminus of Arizona State Route 62 (SR 62), which was the main route connecting Chloride to the rest of the state highway system. The highway was also the eastern terminus of SR 68 at Coyote Pass, which headed west towards Bullhead City and Laughlin, Nevada. The highway reached its eastern terminus in Kingman, entering town on Beale Street, where it connected to U.S. Route 66 at Front Street (now Andy Devine Boulevard). US 93 continued past the terminus of US 466, running concurrent with US 66 east out of Kingman.

==History==
U.S. Route 466 (US 466) was originally commissioned on April 25, 1933, extending from U.S. Route 66 in Barstow, California to the Pacific Ocean at Morro Bay, California. On October 9, 1933, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) approved an extension of US 466 from Barstow to US 66 in Kingman, Arizona. From Kingman to Las Vegas, Nevada, US 466 replaced the original Arizona State Route 69 (SR 69) and Nevada State Route 26 (SR 26). US 466 would use the Boulder Dam to cross the Colorado River over Boulder Canyon between Nevada and Arizona. Between Las Vegas and Barstow, California, the route was co-signed with U.S. Route 91. However, the state of Arizona continued to sign the route between Hoover Dam (formerly Boulder Dam) and Kingman as SR 69, until May 16, 1935. This coincided with the completion of the main dam structure on May 29.

On June 17, 1935, US 93 was extended from its southern terminus at US 91 north of Las Vegas to US 66 in Barstow, being co-signed with US 466 from its eastern terminus at Kingman, Arizona to the US 91 junction in Las Vegas, Nevada. This left the California segment of US 466 as the only section of the route not co-signed with another route.

California decommissioned its section of US 466 during the 1964 state highway renumbering. The California state legislature re-designated the stand alone section of US 466 between Morro Bay and Barstow as California State Route 46 (SR 46), SR 99 and SR 58 respectively. On December 3, 1971, AASHTO approved a request from Arizona and Nevada to remove the US 466 entirely from both states, after which, the US 466 designation ceased to exist.

<doc id="650882" wikidata="Q255101" url="?curid=650882" title="William Longsword of Montferrat">
<text>William of Montferrat (early 1140s – 1177), also called William Longsword (modern Italian &quot;Guglielmo Lungaspada&quot;; original Occitan &quot;Guilhem Longa-Espia&quot;), was the count of Jaffa and Ascalon, the eldest son of Marquess William V of Montferrat and Judith of Babenberg. He was the older brother of Conrad, Boniface, Azalaïs, and Renier, and a cousin of both Emperor Frederick I and King Louis VII of France. 

The earliest surviving mention of William&#x27;s epithet, &quot;Longsword&quot;, said to refer to his military abilities, and differentiating him from his father, known as &quot;William the Elder&quot;, is in the song &quot;En abril, quan vei verdeyar&quot;, composed in late 1176-early 1177 by the troubadour Peire Bremon lo Tort:

:&quot;Chanzos, tu.t n&#x27;iras outra mar,&lt;br&gt; e, per Deu, vai a midons dir&lt;br&gt; qu&#x27;en gran dolor et en cossir&lt;br&gt; me fai la nuoit e.l jorn estar.&lt;br&gt; di.m a&#x27;n Guilhelm Longa-Espia,&lt;br&gt; bona chanzos, qu&#x27;el li.t dia&lt;br&gt; e que i an per lieis confortar.&quot; 

It was rendered into Latin as &quot;Longaspata&quot; by William of Tyre in his &quot;Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum&quot; (written in the early 1180s), whence it has been taken up by historians. 

Despite his eligibility as the eldest son of one of the greatest magnates in northern Italy, with many royal and imperial connections and the fair good looks of his family, he did not marry until he was well into his thirties. In 1167, his father had tried to arrange marriages for him and Conrad to daughters of Henry II of England or sisters of William I of Scotland - but these failed, the English match probably because of consanguinity (the boy&#x27;s mother Judith was related to Eleanor of Aquitaine), the Scottish match because the princesses were already married.

In 1176 William was chosen by Count Raymond III of Tripoli and King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, to marry Baldwin&#x27;s sister Sibylla. William also gained the County of Jaffa and Ascalon in the marriage. William of Tyre describes him as tall, blond, and handsome; brave, frank and unpretentious, but inclined to eat and drink copiously, though not to the impairment of his judgment.

With the King&#x27;s consent, William and Reynald of Châtillon gave a grant of land to the new Castilian military order, the Order of Montjoie, commanded by Count Rodrigo Alvarez de Sarria. However, William&#x27;s activities in Outremer were cut short. He fell ill, probably from malaria, at Ascalon in April 1177, and died there in June, leaving Sibylla pregnant with the future king Baldwin V. His body was taken to Jerusalem and buried at the Hospital of St John.

<text>Leo Melamed (born March 20, 1932) is an American attorney, finance executive, and a pioneer of financial futures. He is the chairman emeritus of CME Group (formerly the Chicago Mercantile Exchange).

== Personal life ==
Melamed was born Leibel Melamdovich in 1932 in Bialystok, Poland into a Jewish family, to two school teachers, Fayga (Barakin) Melamdovich and Isaac Melamdovich (a mathematics teacher). In 1939, following Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland and with the outbreak of World War II, his family fled to Lithuania to avoid capture by the Nazis. In 1940, the Japanese consul general to Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara, issued his family a life-saving transit visa, and they made the long trek across Siberia to safe haven in Tsuruga, Japan. They crossed the Pacific to the United States in the spring of 1941, and the family settled in Chicago. 

Melamed married Betty Sattler on December 26, 1953. The couple has three children: Idelle Sharon, Jordan Norman and David Jeffrey.

Melamed is an avid contract bridge competitor and often pairs with his wife, Betty.

Melamed&#x27;s personal life and his strained relationship with his son are the subjects of the 2012 documentary &quot;Futures Past&quot;, written and directed by his son, Jordan Melamed.

Melamed received his undergraduate degree from the University of Illinois in 1952 and his law degree from John Marshall Law School in 1955. He became involved in futures trading by accident. While in law school, he was looking for a law clerk job and answered a want ad from a firm looking for a &quot;runner&quot;, thinking the firm, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Beane, with &quot;that&quot; many names could be nothing but an established law firm that would be looking for a clerk to &quot;run&quot; to court. Instead, he worked as a runner in the produce futures markets of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange while in law school and learned about the business. He practiced law until 1965 and was elected to the CME board in 1967.

Melamed became chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1969. In 1972, under his leadership, the CME created the International Monetary Market (IMM), the world&#x27;s first financial futures exchange, and launched currency futures. In the years that followed, Melamed led the CME and IMM in the creation of a number of financial instruments, including futures on US Treasury bills in 1976, Eurodollars in 1981, and stock index futures in 1982.

In 1987, Melamed spearheaded the creation and introduction of Globex, the world&#x27;s first electronic trading system, and became its founding chairman.

In 1991, he founded his own consulting firm, Melamed &amp; Associates, of which he is chairman and chief executive officer. He used to be a member of the global markets advisory committee of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and has served as a special advisor on futures markets to governments worldwide. Melamed serves on the prestigious Chinese International Advisory Council of Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).

Throughout the next three decades and into the 21st century, Melamed held many CME titles including: Special Counsel to the Board, Chairman of the Executive Committee, and Senior Policy Advisor, but remained the acknowledged leader of the CME. In 2002, he led the CME membership to become the first U.S. financial exchange to go public.

In 2014, he was a board member of CME Group and chairman of its Strategic Steering Committee.

== Recognition and awards==
Twenty years after their inception, Nobel Laureate in Economics, Merton Miller, named financial futures &quot;the most significant innovation of the past two decades&quot;. At the close of 1999, the former editor of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; named Melamed &quot;among the ten most important Chicagoans in business of the 20th Century&quot;.

He was named a Lincoln Laureate in 2016 in the area of Business, Industry &amp; Communications.

<doc id="650896" wikidata="Q235849" url="?curid=650896" title="Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist">
<text>Elizabeth was the mother of John the Baptist, the wife of Zechariah and a relative of Mary, mother of Jesus, according to the Gospel of Luke. She was past normal child-bearing age when she conceived and gave birth to John. She is revered as a saint by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Lutheran churches, in addition to being a highly respected figure in Islam.

==Biblical narrative==
According to the Gospel of Luke chapter 1, Elizabeth was &quot;of the daughters of Aaron&quot;. She and her husband Zechariah/Zachariah were &quot;righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless&quot; (), but childless. While he was in the temple of the Lord (), Zachariah was visited by the angel Gabriel:
The date on which this occurred, according to theologian Adam C. English, &quot;is September 24, based on computations from the Jewish calendar in accordance with Leviticus 23 regarding the Day of Atonement.&quot;

Zachariah doubted whereby he could know this since both he and his wife were old. The angel identified himself as Gabriel and told Zachariah that he would be &quot;dumb, and not able to speak&quot; until the words were fulfilled, because he did not believe. When the days of his ministry were complete, he returned to his house ().

According to the account, the angel Gabriel was then sent to Nazareth in Galilee to her relative Mary, a virgin, betrothed to a man called Joseph, and informed her that she would conceive by the Holy Spirit and bring forth a son to be called Jesus. Mary was also informed that her &quot;relative Elizabeth&quot; had begun her sixth month of pregnancy, and Mary traveled to &quot;a town in the hill &quot;country&quot; of Judah&quot;, to visit Elizabeth ().


Matthew Henry comments, &quot;Mary knew that Elizabeth was with child, but it does not appear that Elizabeth had been told anything of her relative Mary&#x27;s being designed for the mother of the Messiah; and therefore what knowledge she appears to have had of it must have come by a revelation, which would be a great encouragement to Mary.&quot; After Mary heard Elizabeth&#x27;s blessing, she spoke the words now known as the Magnificat (). 
That is the last mention of Elizabeth, who is not mentioned in any other chapter in the Bible. The chapter continues with the prophecy of Zachariah (known as the Benedictus) and ends with the note that John &quot;grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts&quot; until his ministry to Israel began; so it is unknown how long Elizabeth and her husband lived after that ().

Since the Medieval era, Elizabeth&#x27;s greeting, &quot;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,&quot; has formed the second part of the Hail Mary prayer. 

A traditional &quot;tomb of Elizabeth&quot; is shown in the Franciscan Monastery of Saint John in the Wilderness near Jerusalem.

==Apocrypha==
Elizabeth is mentioned in several books of the Apocrypha, most prominently in the Protevangelion of James, in which the birth of her son, the subsequent murder of her husband, as well as her and John&#x27;s miraculous escape during the Massacre of the Innocents are chronicled.

==Sainthood==
Elizabeth is revered as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church on 5 November, and in the Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican traditions on 5 September, on the same day with her husband Zacharias/Zechariah. She is commemorated as a matriarch in the Calendar of Saints (5 September) of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and Zacharias is commemorated as a prophet.

She is also commemorated on 30 March in Eastern Orthodox Church (Visitation).

==Islam==
Elizabeth (Arabic: , daughter of ), the wife of Zakaria, the mother of Yahya, is an honored woman in Islam. Although Zachariah himself is frequently mentioned by name in the Qur&#x27;an, Elizabeth, while not mentioned by name, is referenced. She is revered by Muslims as a wise, pious and believing person who, like her relative Mary, was exalted by God to a high station. She lived in the household of Imran, and is said to have been a descendant of the prophet and priest Harun.

Zachariah and his wife were both devout and steadfast in their duties. They were, however, both very old and they had no son. Therefore, Zachariah would frequently pray to God for a son. This was not only out of the desire to have a son but also because he wanted someone to carry on the services of the Temple of prayer and to continue the preaching of the Lord&#x27;s message to the children of Israel before his death.
God cured Elizabeth&#x27;s barrenness and granted Zachariah a son, Yahya (John the Baptist), who became a prophet. God thus granted the wishes of the couple because of their faith, trust and love for God. In the Qur&#x27;an, God speaks of Zachariah, his wife, and John, and describes the three as being humble servants of the Lord:

In Sunni Islamic reports of al-Tabari and al-Masudi, Elizabeth is said to have been a daughter of Imran, and thus, a sister of Mary. Therefore, their children Jesus (&quot;Isa&quot;) and John (&quot;Yahya&quot;) are believed to have been cousins. In other accounts, Elizabeth is said to be a daughter of Fakudh, and a sister of Imran&#x27;s wife Hannah.

In Shia hadith she is named Hananah, and is identified as a sister of Mary&#x27;s mother Hannah. Abu Basir recorded that Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, the great grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, had stated: &quot;Hannah, the wife of Imran, and Hananah, the wife of Zechariah, were sisters. He goes on to say that Mary was born from Hannah and John was born from Hananah. Mary gave birth to Jesus and he was the son of the daughter of John&#x27;s aunt. John was the son of the aunt of Mary, and the aunt of one&#x27;s mother is like one&#x27;s aunt.&quot;

==Mandaeism==
In Mandaeism, Enišbai () is the Mandaic name for Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. Enišbai is mentioned in chapters 18, 21, and 32 of the Mandaean Book of John.

<doc id="650897" wikidata="Q72711" url="?curid=650897" title="Cardiac conduction system">
<text>The cardiac conduction system (CCS, also called the electrical conduction system of the heart) transmits the signals generated by the sinoatrial node – the heart&#x27;s pacemaker, to cause the heart muscle to contract, and pump blood through the body&#x27;s circulatory system. The pacemaking signal travels through the right atrium to the atrioventricular node, along the bundle of His, and through the bundle branches to Purkinje fibers in the walls of the ventricles. The Purkinje fibers transmit the signals more rapidly to stimulate contraction of the ventricles.

The conduction system consists of specialized heart muscle cells, situated within the myocardium. There is a skeleton of fibrous tissue that surrounds the conduction system which can be seen on an ECG. Dysfunction of the conduction system can cause irregular heart rhythms including rhythms that are too fast or too slow.

==Structure==

Electrical signals arising in the SA node (located in the right atrium) stimulate the atria to contract. Then the signals travel to the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is located in the interatrial septum. After a short delay that gives the ventricles time to fill with blood, the electrical signal diverges and is conducted through the left and right bundle branches of His to the respective Purkinje fibers for each side of the heart, as well as to the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular epicardium; causing the ventricles to contract. These signals are generated rhythmically, which results in the coordinated rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart.

On the microscopic level, the wave of depolarization propagates to adjacent cells via gap junctions located on the intercalated disc. The heart is a functional syncytium as opposed to a skeletal muscle syncytium. In a functional syncytium, electrical impulses propagate freely between cells in every direction, so that the myocardium functions as a single contractile unit. This property allows rapid, synchronous depolarization of the myocardium. While advantageous under normal circumstances, this property can be detrimental, as it has potential to allow the propagation of incorrect electrical signals. These gap junctions can close to isolate damaged or dying tissue, as in a myocardial infarction (heart attack).

===Development===

Embryologic evidence of generation of the cardiac conduction system illuminates the respective roles of this specialized set of cells. Innervation of the heart begins with a brain only centered parasympathetic cholinergic first order. It is then followed by rapid growth of a second order sympathetic adrenergic system arising from the formation of the thoracic spinal ganglia. The third order of electrical influence of the heart is derived from the vagus nerve as the other peripheral organs form.

==Function==
===Action potential generation===

Cardiac muscle has some similarities to neurons and skeletal muscle, as well as important unique properties. Like a neuron, a given myocardial cell has a negative membrane potential when at rest. Stimulation above a threshold value induces the opening of voltage-gated ion channels and a flood of cations into the cell. The positively charged ions entering the cell cause the depolarization characteristic of an action potential. Like skeletal muscle, depolarization causes the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels and release of Ca2+ from the t-tubules. This influx of calcium causes calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and free Ca2+ causes muscle contraction. After a delay, potassium channels reopen, and the resulting flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarization to the resting state.

There are important physiological differences between nodal cells and ventricular cells; the specific differences in ion channels and mechanisms of polarization give rise to unique properties of SA node cells, most importantly the spontaneous depolarizations necessary for the SA node&#x27;s pacemaker activity.

===Requirements for effective pumping===
In order to maximize efficiency of contractions and cardiac output, the conduction system of the heart has:
* Substantial atrial to ventricular delay. &quot;This will allow the atria to completely empty their contents into the ventricles; simultaneous contraction would cause inefficient filling and backflow. The atria are electrically isolated from the ventricles, connected only via the AV node which briefly delays the signal.&quot;
* Coordinated contraction of ventricular cells. &quot;The ventricles must maximize systolic pressure to force blood through the circulation, so all the ventricular cells must work together.&quot;
** Ventricular contraction begins at the apex of the heart, progressing upwards to eject blood into the great arteries. &quot;Contraction that squeezes blood towards the exit is more efficient than a simple squeeze from all directions. Although the ventricular stimulus originates from the AV node in the wall separating the atria and ventricles, the Bundle of His conducts the signal to the apex.&quot;
** Depolarization propagates through cardiac muscle very rapidly. &quot;Cells of the ventricles contract nearly simultaneously.&quot;
** The action potentials of cardiac muscle are unusually sustained. &quot;This prevents premature relaxation, maintaining initial contraction until the entire myocardium has had time to depolarize and contract.&quot;
* Absence of tetany. &quot;After contracting, the heart must relax to fill up again. Sustained contraction of the heart without relaxation would be fatal, and this is prevented by a temporary&quot; inactivation &quot;of certain ion channels.&quot;

==Electrical activity==


An electrocardiogram is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart.

===SA node: P wave===
Under normal conditions, electrical activity is spontaneously generated by the SA node, the cardiac pacemaker. This electrical impulse is propagated throughout the right atrium, and through Bachmann&#x27;s bundle to the left atrium, stimulating the myocardium of the atria to contract. The conduction of the electrical impulses throughout the atria is seen on the ECG as the P wave.

As the electrical activity is spreading throughout the atria, it travels via specialized pathways, known as &quot;internodal tracts&quot;, from the SA node to the AV node.

===AV node and bundles: PR interval===
The AV node functions as a critical delay in the conduction system. Without this delay, the atria and ventricles would contract at the same time, and blood wouldn&#x27;t flow effectively from the atria to the ventricles. The delay in the AV node forms much of the PR segment on the ECG, and part of atrial repolarization can be represented by the PR segment.

The distal portion of the AV node is known as the bundle of His. The bundle of His splits into two branches in the interventricular septum: the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch. The left bundle branch activates the left ventricle, while the right bundle branch activates the right ventricle.

The left bundle branch is short, splitting into the left anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle. The left posterior fascicle is relatively short and broad, with dual blood supply, making it particularly resistant to ischemic damage. The left posterior fascicle transmits impulses to the papillary muscles, leading to mitral valve closure. As the left posterior fascicle is shorter and broader than the right, impulses reach the papillary muscles just prior to depolarization, and therefore contraction, of the left ventricle myocardium. This allows pre-tensioning of the chordae tendinae, increasing the resistance to flow through the mitral valve during left ventricular contraction. This mechanism works in the same manner as pre-tensioning of car seatbelts.

===Purkinje fibers/ventricular myocardium: QRS complex===
The two bundle branches taper out to produce numerous Purkinje fibers, which stimulate individual groups of myocardial cells to contract.

The spread of electrical activity through the ventricular myocardium produces the QRS complex on the ECG.

Atrial repolarization occurs and is masked during the QRS complex by ventricular depolarization on the ECG.

===Ventricular repolarization===
The last event of the cycle is the repolarization of the ventricles. It is the restoring of the resting state. In the ECG, repolarization includes the J point, ST segment, and T and U waves.
The transthoracically measured PQRS portion of an electrocardiogram is chiefly influenced by the sympathetic nervous system. The T (and occasionally U) waves are chiefly influenced by the parasympathetic nervous system guided by integrated brainstem control from the vagus nerve and the thoracic spinal accessory ganglia.

An impulse (action potential) that originates from the SA node at a relative rate of 60–100 bpm is known as a normal sinus rhythm. If SA nodal impulses occur at a rate less than 60 bpm, the heart rhythm is known as sinus bradycardia. If SA nodal impulses occur at a rate exceeding 100 bpm, the consequent rapid heart rate is sinus tachycardia. These conditions are not necessarily bad symptoms, however. Trained athletes, for example, usually show heart rates slower than 60 bpm when not exercising. If the SA node fails to initialize, the AV junction can take over as the main pacemaker of the heart. The AV junction consists of the AV node, the bundle of His, and the surrounding area; it has a regular rate of 40 to 60 bpm. These &quot;junctional&quot; rhythms are characterized by a missing or inverted P wave. If both the SA node and the AV junction fail to initialize the electrical impulse, the ventricles can fire the electrical impulses themselves at a rate of 20 to 40 bpm and will have a QRS complex of greater than 120 ms. This is necessary for the heart to be in good function.

==Clinical significance==
===Arrhythmia===

An arrhythmia is an abnormal rhythm or speed of rhythm of the heartbeat. A slow heart rate of 60 or less beats per minute is defined as bradycardia. A fast heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute is defined as tachycardia.
An arrhythmia is defined as one that is not physiological such as the lowered heart rate that a trained athlete may naturally have developed; the resting heart rates may be less than 60 bpm.

When an arrhythmia cannot be treated by medication (or other standard cardioversion measures), an artificial pacemaker may be implanted to control the conduction system.

<text>General Sir Peregrine Maitland, GCB (6 July 1777 – 30 May 1854) was a British soldier and colonial administrator. He also was a first-class cricketer from 1798 to 1808 and an early advocate for the establishment of what would become the Canadian Indian residential school system.

==Early life==
Maitland was born at Longparish House in Longparish, Hampshire, the eldest of five sons of Thomas Maitland of Lyndhurst, Hampshire, (d. 1797) by his spouse Jane, daughter of Edward Mathew, General of the Coldstream Guards by his wife Lady Jane (d. 21 August 1793), daughter of Peregrine Bertie, 2nd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. His father was a plantation owner and believed to be from the Pittrichie branch of the Aberdeenshire Maitlands.

==Military career==

After joining the 1st Foot Guards at the age of 15 as an ensign he went on to serve in Flanders in 1794, by which time he had achieved his promotion to lieutenant. In 1798, he took part in the unsuccessful landing at Ostend. In the Peninsular War, he served at both the Battle of Vigo, and at Corunna, for which he was awarded a medal. He took part in the Walcheren in 1809. During the later stages of the Peninsula War was second in command of his regiment at Cadiz, and later at the Battle of Seville.

He served with distinction at Quatre Bras and the Battle of Waterloo. Promoted in early June (3June 1815) to major general, he was assigned to the First Corps, under the overall command of the Prince of Orange. On 18June, the day of Waterloo, he commanded two battalions of the 1st Foot Guards, each 1000-men strong and led the Guards in repelling the final assault of the French Imperial Guard. For his service at Waterloo, Maitland was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, (KCB) on 22June 1815, the Dutch Order of William and the Russian Order of St. Vladimir. For their part, the 1st Foot Guards were granted the honorary title of &#x27;First or Grenadier Regiment of Foot Guards&#x27;.

He was appointed lieutenant governor of Upper Canada in 1818 and supported the Family Compact that dominated the province. He attempted to suppress and reform pro-American tendencies in the colony and resisted demands of radicals in the government. In his role Maitland was the first to propose the civilizing techniques that would eventually lead to the establishment of the Canadian Indian residential school system. He believed that while a shift from hunting to agricultural pursuits would assist with civilizing Indigenous populations, it was gaining the influence of children that would lead to success. In an 1820 report to the Colonial Office he argued for the introduction of industrial schools to minimize the children&#x27;s exposure to the savage influence of their families. His tenure in Upper Canada ended in 1828 when he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia serving there from 1828 until 1834.

Maitland went to India and became commander in chief of the Madras Army in 1836 serving for two years. In 1843 he was appointed Colonel of the 17th (Leicestershire) Regiment and in 1844 Governor of the Cape Colony, but was removed during the Xhosa War. He is still highly respected in the Kingdom of Lesotho for his judgment on the border issue between the Orange River Afrikaners and the Basotho of King Moshoeshoe I, which, had it been implemented, would have secured the economic future of the kingdom. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 6 April 1852.

== Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia ==
Maitland became the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia on 29 Nov. 1828, with the added responsibility of commander-in-chief of the forces in the Atlantic region. He was popular. Certainly, his strongly moral conduct influenced Halifax&#x27;s society. By insisting on walking to church, he effectively ended the garrison parades on Sunday, the city&#x27;s major social event, and he publicly denounced the open market that day.

Maitland was responsible for the settlement reached for Pictou Academy. In dealing with immigration and settlement, he had lands laid out in Cape Breton at crown expense so that the 4,000 immigrants expected that year could be legally placed and systematically settled.

In October 1832 Maitland went to England on leave, presumably because of his health, and the government was placed in charge of Thomas Nickleson Jeffery. Though he continued to conduct official correspondence from England, he never returned to North America and he was succeeded in Nova Scotia by Sir Colin Campbell in July 1834.

==First-class cricket career==
Maitland was an amateur first-class cricketer who made 27 known appearances in first-class cricket matches from 1798 to 1808.

He was mainly associated with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and he also played for Surrey and Hampshire.

==Family==

Peregrine Maitland was the eldest of five sons of Thomas Maitland (died 1797) and Jane Mathew (1759-1830), daughter of Major General Edward Mathew and Jane Bertie. He had three sisters, and his eldest sister Jane married in 1800 a Lieutenant Colonel Warren of the Third Foot Guards. Maitland&#x27;s maternal aunt married James Austen, brother of Jane Austen.

Maitland married twice: (1) on 8 June 1803, in St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, (Westminster), to Louisa (d. 1805), daughter of Sir Edward Crofton, 2nd Baronet, and (2) at the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s HQ during the occupation of Paris, 9 October 1815, Lady Sarah Lennox (1792–1873), one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Richmond. Despite the initial opposition of her father, the marriage took place after the intervention and support of the Duke of Wellington. When the Duke of Richmond was appointed Governor-in-Chief of Canada, he appointed Maitland as Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada.

By his first wife, he had one son, Peregrine Maitland b. 1 May 1804. By his second wife, he had at least seven children:
* Sarah (1817–1900), who married Thomas Bowes Forster (1802–1870), Lieutenant-Colonel in the Madras Army.
* Charlotte Caroline Maitland (9 Dec 1817-8 Jan 1897), married John George Turnbull (10 Aug 1790-2 Jan 1872) on 17 Jul 1837
* Charles Lennox Brownlow Maitland (27 Sep 1823-5 Jan 1891)
* Jane Bertie Maitland (abt 1826-27 Apr 1885)
* Emily Sophia Maitland (1827-16 Dec 1891), married Frederick Herbert Kerr (30 Sep 1818-Jan 1896) on 13 Jan 1846
* George Maitland (1830-1831) (buried at St. Paul&#x27;s Church (Halifax))
* Eliza Mary Maitland (1832), married John Desborough (24 Jan 1824-14 Jan 1918) on 14 Jul 1857
* Georgina Louisa Maitland (aft 1832-5 Jan 1852), married Thomas Eardley Wilmot Blomefield (died 15 Jan 1896) on 2 Jan 1844
* Horatio Lennox Arthur Maitland (13 Mar 1834-29 Mar 1904)
He was buried at St Paul&#x27;s Church in Tongham in Surrey.

He is a great-great-great uncle of composer and impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber and the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber.

==Maitland in popular fiction==
In his novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Victor Hugo credits Maitland (or Colville) with asking for the surrender of the Imperial Guard and receiving General Cambronne&#x27;s reply of &quot;Merde&quot;. (Chapter XIV. The Last Square)

== Legacy ==

Port Maitland, Nova Scotia, is named after him, as is Maitland, Nova Scotia. Maitland Street, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia is named after him, as is Maitland Street in London, Ontario. Also named in his honor are Maitland Street and Maitland Terrace (in Church and Wellesley), Maitland Place (continuation of Maitland Street east of Jarvis Street in Cabbagetown) in Toronto, Ontario. The Church of St. John the Evangelist Anglican in Niagara Falls, Ontario was constructed in 1825 largely through the efforts of Lieutenant-Governor Sir Peregrine Maitland. The church remained in regular use until 1957. Maitland, Ontario, on the St. Lawrence River is named after him.

In New South Wales, Australia, the town of Maitland bears his name. It is one of a series of settlements founded in the years following Waterloo named for Wellington and his subordinate commanders, both from Waterloo and the Peninsula. These include Wellington, Orange, Picton, Grahamstown (Sir Thomas Graham), Pakenham (Sir Edward Pakenham) and Beresfield (Sir William Carr Beresford - misspelt).

In South Africa Maitland, Cape Town, a light industrial and residential suburb, the Maitland River west of Port Elizabeth (empties in Indian Ocean at Maitland Beach, Maitland Local Authority Nature Reserve, and numerous streets in the country are named after him.

Sir Peregrine Maitland is responsible for the naming of Lobo, Ontario, Mariposa, Ontario, Orillia, Ontario, Oro, Ontario, Oso, Ontario, Sombra, Ontario and Zorra, Ontario. All names are in Spanish.

<doc id="650906" wikidata="Q1517326" url="?curid=650906" title="History of cricket">
<text>The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century England. It became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877. Cricket is the world&#x27;s second most popular spectator sport, after association football (soccer).

Internationally, cricket is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership, although only twelve currently play Test cricket.

The game&#x27;s rules are defined in the &quot;Laws of cricket&quot;. The game has various formats, ranging from T-10(Ten-10) played in around 90 minutes to Test matches, which can last up to five days.

==Early cricket==

===Origin===
Cricket was created during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England that lies across Kent and Sussex. The first definite written reference is from the end of the 16th century.

There have been several speculations about the game&#x27;s origins, including some that it was created in France or Flanders. The earliest of these speculative references is from 1300 and concerns the future King Edward II playing at &quot;creag and other games&quot; in both Westminster and Newenden. It has been suggested that &quot;creag&quot; was an Old English word for cricket, but expert opinion is that it was an early spelling of &quot;craic&quot;, meaning &quot;fun and games in general&quot;.

It is generally believed that cricket survived as a children&#x27;s game for many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the beginning of the 17th century. Possibly cricket was derived from bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep&#x27;s wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate (e.g., a wicket gate) as the wicket.

===First definite reference===
In 1597 (Old Style – 1598 New Style) a court case in England concerning an ownership dispute over a plot of common land in Guildford, Surrey, mentions the game of . A 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, testified that he and his school friends had played on the site fifty years earlier when they attended the Free School. Derrick&#x27;s account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey &quot;circa&quot; 1550, and is the earliest universally accepted reference to the game.

The first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, when two men in Sussex were prosecuted for playing cricket on Sunday instead of going to church. In the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys&#x27; game, and this suggests that adult participation was a recent development. In an account of a case brought before the King&#x27;s Bench in 1640, it is recorded that a cricket match &quot;between the Weald &amp; Upland&quot; took place &quot;about 30 yeares &quot; previously.

===Derivation of the name of &quot;cricket&quot;===
A number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term &quot;cricket&quot;. In the earliest definite reference, it was spelled . The name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch &quot;krick&quot;(&quot;-e&quot;), meaning a stick; or the Old English or meaning a crutch or staff, or the French word meaning a wooden post. The Middle Dutch word means a long low stool used for kneeling in church; this resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket. According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the University of Bonn, &quot;cricket&quot; derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, (i.e., &quot;with the stick chase&quot;).

It is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use in south-east England at the time and, given trade connections with the County of Flanders, especially in the 15th century when it belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, many Middle Dutch words found their way into southern English dialects.

===The Commonwealth===
After the Civil War ended in 1648, the new Puritan government clamped down on &quot;unlawful assemblies&quot;, in particular the more raucous sports such as football. Their laws also demanded a stricter observance of the Sabbath than there had been previously. As the Sabbath was the only free time available to the lower classes, cricket&#x27;s popularity may have waned during the Commonwealth. However, it did flourish in public fee-paying schools such as Winchester and St Paul&#x27;s. There is no actual evidence that Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s regime banned cricket specifically and there are references to it during the interregnum that suggest it was acceptable to the authorities provided that it did not cause any &quot;breach of the Sabbath&quot;. It is believed that the nobility in general adopted cricket at this time through involvement in village games.

===Gambling and press coverage===
Cricket thrived after the Restoration in 1660 and is believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time. It is possible, as believed by some historians, that top-class matches began. In 1664, the &quot;Cavalier&quot; Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited stakes to £100, although that was still a fortune at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms . Cricket had become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century, as evidenced in 1697 by a newspaper report of a &quot;great match&quot; played in Sussex which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 guineas a side.

With freedom of the press having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be reported in the newspapers. But it was a long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, coverage of the game. During the first half of the 18th century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the play.

==18th-century cricket==
===Patronage and players===
Gambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first &quot;county teams&quot; were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing &quot;local experts&quot; from village cricket as the earliest professionals. The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.

The most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons&#x27; influence. These men included the 2nd Duke of Richmond, Sir William Gage, Alan Brodrick and Edwin Stead. For the first time, the press mentions individual players like Thomas Waymark.

===Cricket expands beyond England===

Cricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies in the 17th century, probably before it had even reached the north of England. In the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It was introduced to the West Indies by colonists and to the Indian subcontinent by East India Company mariners in the first half of the century. It arrived in Australia almost as soon as colonisation began in 1788. New Zealand and South Africa followed in the early years of the 19th century.

Cricket never caught on in Canada, despite efforts by the upper class to promote the game as a way of identifying with the &quot;mother country&quot;. Canada, unlike Australia and the West Indies, witnessed a continual decline in the popularity of the game during 1860 to 1960. Linked in the public consciousness to an upper-class sport, the game never became popular with the general public. In the summer season it had to compete with baseball. During the First World War, Canadian units stationed in France played baseball instead of cricket.

===Development of the Laws===
It&#x27;s not clear when the basic rules of cricket such as bat and ball, the wicket, pitch dimensions, overs, how out, etc. were originally formulated. In 1728, the Duke of Richmond and Alan Brodick drew up Articles of Agreement to determine the code of practice in a particular game and this became a common feature, especially around payment of stake money and distributing the winnings given the importance of gambling.

In 1744, the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; were codified for the first time and then amended in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, middle stump and maximum bat width were added. These laws stated that &quot;the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes&quot;. The codes were drawn up by the so-called &quot;Star and Garter Club&quot; whose members ultimately founded the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord&#x27;s in 1787. The MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made periodic revisions and recodifications subsequently.

===Continued growth in England===
The game continued to spread throughout England, and, in 1751, Yorkshire is first mentioned as a venue. The original form of bowling (i.e., rolling the ball along the ground as in bowls) was superseded sometime after 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball and study variations in line, length and pace. Scorecards began to be kept on a regular basis from 1772; since then, an increasingly clear picture has emerged of the sport&#x27;s development.

The first famous clubs were London and Dartford in the early 18th century. London played its matches on the Artillery Ground, which still exists. Others followed, particularly Slindon in Sussex, which was backed by the Duke of Richmond and featured the star player Richard Newland. There were other prominent clubs at Maidenhead, Hornchurch, Maidstone, Sevenoaks, Bromley, Addington, Hadlow and Chertsey.

But far and away the most famous of the early clubs was Hambledon in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players including the master batsman John Small and the first great fast bowler Thomas Brett. Their most notable opponent was the Chertsey and Surrey bowler Edward &quot;Lumpy&quot; Stevens, who is believed to have been the main proponent of the flighted delivery.

It was in answer to the flighted, or pitched, delivery that the straight bat was introduced. The old &quot;hockey stick&quot;–style of bat was only really effective against the ball being trundled or skimmed along the ground.

First-class cricket began in 1772. Three surviving scorecards exist of 1772 matches organised by the Hambledon Club which commence a continuous statistical record. Those three matches were all between a Hampshire XI and an England XI, the first played at Broadhalfpenny Down on 24 and 25 June. The two leading online archives begin their first-class coverage with this match which is numbered &quot;first-class no. 1&quot; by ESPNcricinfo and &quot;f1&quot; by CricketArchive. Broadhalfpenny Down continued in regular use by Hambledon/Hampshire teams until 1781.

==19th-century cricket==
The game also underwent a fundamental change of organisation with the formation for the first time of county clubs. All the modern county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839, were founded during the 19th century. No sooner had the first county clubs established themselves than they faced what amounted to &quot;player action&quot; as William Clarke created the travelling All-England Eleven in 1846. Though a commercial venture, this team did much to popularise the game in districts which had never previously been visited by high-class cricketers. Other similar teams were created and this vogue lasted for about thirty years. But the counties and MCC prevailed.
The growth of cricket in the mid and late 19th century was assisted by the development of the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.

In 1864, another bowling revolution resulted in the legalisation of overarm and in the same year Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack was first published. W. G. Grace began his long and influential career at this time, his feats doing much to increase cricket&#x27;s popularity. He introduced technical innovations which revolutionised the game, particularly in batting.

===International cricket begins===
The first ever international cricket game was between the US and Canada in 1844. The match was played at the grounds of the St George&#x27;s Cricket Club in New York.

In 1859, a team of leading English professionals set off to North America on the first-ever overseas tour and, in 1862, the first English team toured Australia. Between May and October 1868, a team of Aboriginal Australians toured England in what was the first Australian cricket team to travel overseas.

In 1877, an England touring team in Australia played two matches against full Australian XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural Test matches. The following year, the Australians toured England for the first time and the success of this tour ensured a popular demand for similar ventures in future. No Tests were played in 1878 but more soon followed and, at The Oval in 1882, the Australian victory in a tense finish gave rise to The Ashes.

South Africa became the third Test nation in 1889.

=== Decline in baseball-playing countries ===
Cricket started off as one of the more popular sports in America, aided by the invention of informal cricket variants such as wicket which resulted in higher-scoring matches that could be completed in an afternoon, rather than over the course of a few days. However, baseball overtook cricket&#x27;s popularity in the United States during the American Civil War, as soldiers who had played baseball during the war went back to their homes across the country and took the game with them. Some factors in favour of baseball&#x27;s rise were that it had a much shorter playing duration and that it could be played on any patch of land (rather than requiring special preparations such as the cricket pitch), which was essential for troops who needed to be able to move at a moment&#x27;s notice during the war. William Humber argues that there was also less of a social taboo against playing baseball in the New World than in England, despite the game having initially been low in popularity in both places due to cricket having been perceived as more appropriate for adults. The same factors that favored baseball&#x27;s rise in the United States then saw the sport overtake cricket in Japan, with growing American influence in the Pacific Rim also playing a role.

Cricket came to Latin America in the 19th century, as part of a broader significant British presence in the region at the time. However, the sport was concentrated amongst expatriates and elites as opposed to being spread among the broader population, which limited its growth. By the 20th century, the growing influence of America eventually meant that baseball became the more popular bat-and-ball sport in the Caribbean, while World War I resulted in British expatriates returning to Britain to fight, drying up the support base for the game in Mexico.

=== Growth in the colonies ===
Cricket was promoted by the British as a game which required a certain type of manliness and morality, and which played into prevailing ideas of British racial and imperial superiority; it was seen as giving participants the strength necessary to expand the empire, while also unifying the colonies together with Britain.

Cricket grew significantly in many of the colonies during this time, aided by the fact that many colonised peoples saw it and other British sports as a source of nationalistic pride and one of the few venues in which they could defeat their colonisers. It was also a way for colonial subjects to Anglicize themselves and thus gain power.

===National championships===
A significant development in domestic cricket occurred in 1890 when the official County Championship was constituted in England. Soon afterwards, in May 1894, the sport&#x27;s first-class standard was officially defined. This organisational initiative has been repeated in other countries. Australia established the Sheffield Shield in 1892–93. Other national competitions to be established were the Currie Cup in South Africa, the Plunket Shield in New Zealand and the Ranji Trophy in India. The ICC re-defined first-class status in 1947 as a global concept.

The period from 1890 to the outbreak of the First World War has become one of nostalgia, ostensibly because the teams played cricket according to &quot;the spirit of the game&quot;, but more realistically because it was a peacetime period that was shattered by the First World War. The era has been called The Golden Age of cricket and it featured numerous great names such as Grace, Wilfred Rhodes, C. B. Fry, Ranjitsinhji and Victor Trumper.

===Balls per over===
During most of the 19th-century standard overs were made up of four deliveries. In 1889 five-ball overs were introduced in first-class cricket, with a move to generally use six-ball overs in 1900.

In the 20th century, eight-ball overs were used at times in a number of countries, primarily Australia, where eight-balls were the standard over length between 1918/19 and 1978/79, South Africa and New Zealand. Since the 1979/80 Australian and New Zealand seasons, six balls per over have been used worldwide, and the most recent version of the Laws only permits six-ball overs.

===Growth of international cricket===

Cricket was introduced to various colonies around the world. The Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) was founded in 1909 with England, Australia and South Africa as the founding members. The ICC included the Marylebone Cricket club, the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket, and the South African Cricket Association as its original associations . The conference aimed to regulate international cricket among three nations, which were considered to be of equal status at the time.

 In 1926, both New Zealand and the West Indies were admitted as members, allowing them to play Test cricket against the other sides. However, at this time in the West Indies, cricket was primarily dominated by the white population. Originally, the ICC was not interested in broadening the international popularity of cricket. The organization was reluctant to invite non-commonwealth nations to play. New Zealand was restricted to play three-day test matches. New Zealand and India both became Test playing nations before World War II and Pakistan joined soon afterwards in 1952.

At the initial suggestion of Pakistan, the ICC was expanded to include non-Test playing countries from 1965, with Associate members being admitted. At the same time the organisation changed its name to the International Cricket Conference. The first limited-overs World Cups were played during the 1970s and Sri Lanka became the first Associate member to be raised to Test playing status in 1982. Because the ICC was predominantly a Western organization, the founding countries decided who was allowed to join the conference or engage in test cricket. There was no desire or attempt to create a set of Associate nations that would play in Test status, which is why countries such as Sri Lanka were not permitted to partake until the 1980s.

The international game continued to grow with the introduction of Affiliate Member status in 1984, a level of membership designed for sides with less history of playing cricket. In 1989 the ICC renamed itself the International Cricket Council. Zimbabwe became Full Members in 1992 and Bangladesh in 2000 before Afghanistan and Ireland were both admitted as Test sides in 2018, bringing the number of full members of the ICC to 12.

===Suspension of South Africa (1970–1991)===
The greatest crisis to hit international cricket was brought about by apartheid, the South African policy of racial segregation. The situation began to crystallise after 1961 when South Africa left the Commonwealth of Nations and so, under the rules of the day, its cricket board had to leave the International Cricket Conference (ICC). Cricket&#x27;s opposition to apartheid intensified in 1968 with the cancellation of England&#x27;s tour to South Africa by the South African authorities, due to the inclusion in the England team of Basil D&#x27;Oliveira, a Cape Coloured player. In 1970, the ICC members voted to suspend South Africa indefinitely from international cricket competition.

Starved of top-level competition for its best players, the South African Cricket Board began funding so-called &quot;rebel tours&quot;, offering large sums of money for international players to form teams and tour South Africa. The ICC&#x27;s response was to blacklist any rebel players who agreed to tour South Africa, banning them from officially sanctioned international cricket. As players were poorly remunerated during the 1970s, several accepted the offer to tour South Africa, particularly players getting towards the end of their careers for which a blacklisting would have little effect.

The rebel tours continued into the 1980s but then progress was made in South African politics and it became clear that apartheid was ending. South Africa, now a &quot;Rainbow Nation&quot; under Nelson Mandela, was welcomed back into international sport in 1991.

===World Series Cricket===

The money problems of top cricketers were also the root cause of another cricketing crisis that arose in 1977 when the Australian media magnate Kerry Packer fell out with the Australian Cricket Board over TV rights. Taking advantage of the low remuneration paid to players, Packer retaliated by signing several of the best players in the world to a privately run cricket league outside the structure of international cricket. World Series Cricket hired some of the banned South African players and allowed them to show off their skills in an international arena against other world-class players. The schism lasted only until 1979 and the &quot;rebel&quot; players were allowed back into established international cricket, though many found that their national teams had moved on without them. Long-term results of World Series Cricket have included the introduction of significantly higher player salaries and innovations such as coloured kit and night games.

===Limited-overs cricket===
In the 1960s, English county teams began playing a version of cricket with games of only one innings each and a maximum number of overs per innings. Starting in 1963 as a knockout competition only, limited-overs cricket grew in popularity and, in 1969, a national league was created which consequently caused a reduction in the number of matches in the County Championship. The status of limited overs matches is governed by the official List A categorisation. Although many &quot;traditional&quot; cricket fans objected to the shorter form of the game, limited-overs cricket did have the advantage of delivering a result to spectators within a single day; it did improve cricket&#x27;s appeal to younger or busier people; and it did prove commercially successful.

The first limited-overs international match took place at Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but turned out to be immensely popular. limited-overs internationals (LOIs or ODIs—one-day internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people who want to be able to see a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first Cricket World Cup in England in 1975, with all the Test-playing nations taking part.

===Analytic and graphic technology===
Limited-overs cricket increased television ratings for cricket coverage. Innovative techniques introduced in coverage of limited-over matches were soon adopted for Test coverage. The innovations included presentation of in-depth statistics and graphical analysis, placing miniature cameras in the stumps, multiple usage of cameras to provide shots from several locations around the ground, high-speed photography and computer graphics technology enabling television viewers to study the course of a delivery and help them understand an umpire&#x27;s decision.

In 1992, the use of a third umpire to adjudicate run-out appeals with television replays was introduced in the Test series between South Africa and India. The third umpire&#x27;s duties have subsequently expanded to include decisions on other aspects of play such as stumpings, catches and boundaries. From 2011, the third umpire was being called upon to moderate review of umpires&#x27; decisions, including lbw, with the aid of virtual-reality tracking technologies (e.g., Hawk-Eye and Hot Spot), though such measures still could not free some disputed decisions from heated controversy.

=== Expansion of the game ===

In June 2001, the ICC introduced a &quot;Test Championship Table&quot; and, in October 2002, a &quot;One-day International Championship Table&quot;. As indicated by ICC rankings, the various cricket formats have continued to be a major competitive sport in most former British Empire countries, notably the Indian subcontinent, and new participants including the Netherlands. In 2017, the number of countries with full ICC membership was increased to twelve by the addition of Afghanistan and Ireland. The ICC expanded its development programme, aiming to produce more national teams capable of competing at the various formats. Development efforts are focused on African and Asian nations, and on the United States. In 2004, the ICC Intercontinental Cup brought first-class cricket to 12 nations, mostly for the first time.

=== T20 cricket and shorter formats&#x27; growth ===
Cricket&#x27;s newest innovation is Twenty20 (T20), essentially an evening entertainment started in 2003. It has so far enjoyed enormous popularity and has attracted large attendances at matches as well as good TV audience ratings. The inaugural ICC Twenty20 World Cup tournament was held in 2007. The formation of Twenty20 leagues in India – the unofficial Indian Cricket League, which started in 2007, and the official Indian Premier League, starting in 2008 – raised much speculation in the cricketing press about their effect on the future of cricket.

Formats shorter than Twenty20 have also arisen at the domestic level, such as the T10 format, which is played in leagues organised by various Associate and Full Members, as well as the 100-ball format, which is played in The Hundred, a major limited-overs competition in England. In 100-ball cricket, a bowler bowls 5 balls in an over and is able to bowl two consecutive overs.

<text>Security printing is the field of the printing industry that deals with the printing of items such as banknotes, cheques, passports, tamper-evident labels, security tapes, product authentication, stock certificates, postage stamps, and identity cards. The main goal of security printing is to prevent forgery, tampering, or counterfeiting. More recently many of the techniques used to protect these high-value documents have become more available to commercial printers, whether they are using the more traditional offset and flexographic presses or the newer digital platforms. Businesses are protecting their lesser-value documents such as transcripts, coupons and prescription pads by incorporating some of the features listed below to ensure that they cannot be forged or that alteration of the data cannot occur undetected.

A number of technical methods are used in the security printing industry. Security printing is most often done on security paper, but it can also occur on plastic materials.

== Features detectable by humans ==
Secured documents, such as banknotes, use visible and tactile features to allow humans to verify their authenticity without tools. The European Central Bank (ECB) recommends feel, look, and tilt: First check the tactility of the banknote (including the substrate), then look at the optical design and finally the characteristics of certain optical features when tilting the banknote in relation to the incident light.
In general, the introduction of a new banknote series is accompanied by information campaigns describing the design and the security features. Several central banks also provide mobile apps explaining the characteristics by interactive methods and enrich them by animated effects. In general, they use the camera of a mobile device to explain the features of a presented banknote. As they do not support the direct verification of authenticity they also work with simple printouts or screen displays. 

* &quot;SwissBanknotes&quot; from the Swiss National Bank for the Swiss franc with animated effects
* &quot;MalawiKwacha&quot; from the Reserve Bank of Malawi for the Malawian kwacha with simulations of tilting and tactility as well as interactive effects by enhanced reality
* &quot;SARBCurrency&quot; from the South African Reserve Bank for the South African rand as an offline application explaining the security features by enhanced reality
* &quot;Lilangeni&quot; from the Central Bank of Eswatini for the Swazi lilangeni with simulations of tilting and tactility as well as interactive effects by enhanced reality

=== Substrate ===
==== Paper ====
The substrate of most banknotes is made of paper, almost always from cotton fibres for strength and durability; in some cases linen or specially coloured or forensic fibres are added to give the paper added individuality and protect against counterfeiting. Paper substrate may also include windows based on laser-cut holes covered by a security foil with holographic elements. All of this makes it difficult to reproduce using common counterfeiting techniques.

==== Polymer ====
Some countries, including Canada, Nigeria, Romania, Mexico, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Israel, Singapore, Malaysia, United Kingdom, and Australia, produce polymer (plastic) banknotes, to improve longevity and to make counterfeiting more difficult. Polymer can include transparent windows, diffraction grating, and raised printing. 

==== Format ====

Most currencies use different dimensions of length, width, or both for the different denominations, with smaller formats for the lower denominations and larger formats for the higher denominations, to hinder reuse of the substrate with embedded security features for counterfeiting higher denominations. 

Blind and visually impaired people may also rely on the format for distinguishing between the denominations.

=== Visible security features ===
==== Watermark ====
True watermark

A true watermark is a recognizable image or pattern in paper that appears lighter or darker than surrounding paper when viewed with a light from behind the paper, due to paper density variations. A watermark is made by impressing a water coated metal stamp or dandy roll onto the paper during manufacturing. Watermarks were first introduced in Bologna, Italy in 1282; as well as their use in security printing, they have also been used by paper makers to identify their product. For proofing the authenticity, the thinner part of the watermark will shine brighter with a light source in the background and darker with a dark background. The watermark is a proven anti-counterfeit technology because most counterfeits only simulate its appearance by using a printing pattern.

Simulated watermark

Printed with white ink, simulated watermarks have a different reflectance than the base paper and can be seen at an angle. Because the ink is white, it cannot be photocopied or scanned. A similar effect can be achieved by iriodin varnish which creates reflections under certain viewing angles only and is transparent otherwise.
Watermarks are sometimes simulated on polymer currency by printing an according pattern, but with little anti-counterfeiting effect. For example, the Australian dollar has its coat of arms watermarked on all its plastic bills. A Diffractive Optical Element (DOE) within the transparent window can create a comparable effect but requires a laser beam for its verification.

==== See-through register ====
See-through registers are based on complementary patterns on the obverse and reverse of the banknote and constitute a complete pattern under backlight conditions. Examples are the &quot;D&quot; of the Deutsche Mark (1989 series, BBk III) and the value number of the first series of euro banknotes (ES1). Counterfeiting is difficult because the printing registration requires an extremely high printing accuracy on both sides and minor deviations are easily detectable. 

==== See-through window ====
Polymer banknotes which are printed on a basically transparent substrate easily provide clear areas by sparing the white coating. This window may be overprinted by patterns. Initially this was the main human security feature for polymer banknotes which cannot use watermark or security threads. It attracted counterfeiting of large volumes when printing technology for polymer substrate became commonly available. Therefore new designs additionally laminate this window with an ultra-thin security foil, e.g., on the Frontier series of the Canadian dollar which was issued from 2011, and the Australian dollar (2nd series) issued from 2016.

A very similar security feature is achieved with banknotes on paper substrate. For this an area of up to 300 mm² is punched out and sealed with a partially transparent security foil. The ES2 series of euro banknotes is using this feature for the higher denominations (EUR 20 and above) and calls it &quot;portrait window&quot;. The European Central Bank (ECB) recommends to &quot;look at the banknote against the light – the window in the hologram becomes transparent and reveals a portrait of Europa on both sides of the note&quot;.

==== Micro-perforation ====
Micro-perforation is used as &quot;Microperf&quot; in the Swiss franc and the Romanian leu. Very small holes are punched or laser-engraved into the substrate or a foil application without generating a &quot;crater&quot;. In backlight illumination, the holes form a pattern, e.g., the value numeral like in the SFR 20 (eighth series).

==== Geometric lathe work ====
A guilloché is an ornamental pattern formed of two or more curved bands that interlace to repeat a circular design. They are made with a geometric lathe.

==== Microprinting ====
This involves the use of extremely small text, and is most often used on currency and bank checks. The text is generally small enough to be indiscernible to the naked eye without either close inspection or the use of a magnifying glass. Cheques, for example, use microprint as the signature line.


==== Optically variable ink ====
Optically Variable Ink (OVI) displays different colours depending on the angle at which it is viewed. It uses mica-based glitter. As an example, the euro banknotes use this feature as &quot;emerald number&quot; on the ES2 series. The ECB recommends to &quot;tilt the banknote&quot;. The shiny number in the bottom left corner displays an effect of the light that moves up and down. The number also changes colour from emerald green to deep blue. The EUR 100 and EUR 200 banknotes also show € symbols inside the number.

Colouured magnetizable inks are prepared by including chromatic pigments of high colour strength. The magnetic pigments’ strong inherent colour generally reduces the spectrum of achievable shades. Generally, pigments should be used at high concentrations to ensure that sufficient magnetizable material is applied even in thin offset coats. Some magnetic pigment are best suited for coloured magnetizable inks due to their lower blackness.

Homogeneous magnetization (no preferred orientation) is easily obtained on pigment made of spherical particles. Best results are achieved when remanence and coercive field strength are very low and the saturating magnetization is high.

When pearlescent pigments are viewed at different angles the angle of the light as it&#x27;s perceived makes the colour appear to change as the magnetic fields within the particles shift direction.

==== Holograms ====

A hologram may be embedded either via hot-stamping foil, wherein an extremely thin layer of only a few micrometers of depth is bonded into the paper or a plastic substrate by means of a hot-melt adhesive (called a size coat) and heat from a metal die, or it may be directly embossed as holographic paper, or onto the laminate of a card itself.
When incorporated with a custom design pattern or logo, hologram hot stamping foils become security foils that protect credit cards, passports, bank notes and value documents from counterfeiting. Holograms help in curtailing forging, and duplication of products hence are very essential for security purposes. Once stamped on a product, they cannot be removed or forged, enhancing the product at the same time. Also from a security perspective, if stamped, a hologram is a superior security device as it is virtually impossible to remove from its substrate.
==== Security threads ====
Metal threads and foils, from simple iridescent features to foil colour copying to foils with additional optically variable effects are often used.

There are two kinds of security threads. One is a thin aluminum coated and partly de-metallized polyester film thread with microprinting which is embedded in the security paper as banknote or passport paper. The other kind of security thread is the single or multicolour sewing thread made from cotton or synthetic fibers, mostly UV fluorescent, for the bookbinding of passport booklets. In recent designs the security thread was enhanced with other security features such as holograms or three-dimensional effects when tilted.

On occasion, the banknote designers succumb to the Titanic effect (excess belief in the latest technology), and place too much faith in some particular trick. An example is the forgery of British banknotes in the 1990s. British banknotes in the 1990s featured a &quot;windowed&quot; metal strip through the paper about 1 mm wide that comes to the paper surface every 8 mm. When examined in reflected light, it appears to have a dotted metallic line running across it, but when viewed through transmitted light, the metal strip is dark and solid.

Duplicating this was thought to be difficult, but a criminal gang was able to reproduce it quickly. They used a cheap hot-stamping process to lay down a metal strip on the surface of the paper, then printed a pattern of solid bars over it using white ink to leave the expected metal pattern visible. At their trial, they were found to have forged tens of millions of pounds’ worth of notes over a period of years.

==== Prismatic colouration ====
The use of colour can greatly assist the prevention of forgeries. By including a colour on a document a colour photocopier must be used in the attempt to make a copy however the use of these machines also tends to enhance the effectiveness of other technologies such as Void Pantographs and Verification Grids (see Copy-evident below).

By using two or more colours in the background and blending them together a prismatic effect can be created. This can be done on either a traditional or a digital press. When a document using this technique is attempted to be photocopied the scanning and re-creation by a colour copier is inexact usually resulting in banding or blotching and thereby immediate recognition of the document as being a copy.

A frequent example of prismatic colouring is on checks where it is combined with other techniques such as the void pantograph to increase the difficulty of successful counterfeiting.

==== Copy-evidence ====

Sometimes only the original document has value. An original, signed cheque for example has value but a photocopy of it does not. An original prescription script can be filled but a photocopy of it should not be. Copy-evident technologies provide security to hard copy documents by helping distinguish between the original document and the copy.

The most common technology to help differentiate originals from copies is the void pantograph. Void pantographs are essentially invisible to the untrained, naked eye on an original but when scanned or copied the layout of lines, dots and dashes will reveal a word (frequently VOID and hence the name) or symbol that clearly allows the copy to be identified. This technology is available on both traditional presses (offset and flexographic) and on the newer digital platforms. The advantage of a digital press is that in a single pass through the printer a void pantograph with all the variable data can be printed on plain paper.

Copy-evident paper, sometimes marketed as ‘security paper’, is pre-printed void pantograph paper that was usually produced on an offset or flexographic press. The quality of the void pantograph is usually quite good because it was produced on a press with a very high resolution, and, when only a small number of originals are to be printed, it can be a cost-effective solution; however, the advent of the digital printer has rapidly eroded this benefit.

A second technology which complements and enhances the effectiveness of the void pantograph is the Verification Grid. This technology is visible on the original, usually as fine lines or symbols but when photocopied these lines and images disappear; the inverse reaction of the void pantograph. The most common examples of this technology are on the fine lines at the edge of a cheque which will disappear when copied or on a coupon when a symbol, such as a shopping cart, disappears when an unauthorized copy is made. Verification Grid is available for either traditional or digital presses.

Together the void pantograph and the Verification Grid complement each other because the reactions to copying are inverse, resulting in a higher degree of assurance that a hard copy document is an original.

==== Registration of features on both sides ====
Banknotes are typically printed with fine alignment (so-called &quot;see-through registration window&quot;) between the offset printing on each side of the note. This allows the note to be examined for this feature, and provides opportunities to unambiguously align other features of the note with the printing. Again, this is difficult to imitate accurately enough in most print shops.
==== Thermochromatic ink ====

Several types of ink are available which change colour with temperature. Security ink with a normal &quot;trigger&quot; temperature of , which will either disappear or change colours when the ink is rubbed, usually by the fingertips. This is based on a thermochromatic effect.

==== Serial numbers ====
Serial numbers help make legitimate documents easier to track and audit. However, they are barely useful as a security feature because duplicates of an existing serial number are not easily detectable, except for a series of identical counterfeits. 

To support correct identification serial numbers normally have a check digit to verify the correct reading of the serial number. In banknote printing the unique serial number provides effective means for the monitoring and verification of the production volume. In some cases the recording of serial numbers may help to track and identify banknotes from blackmail or robbery.

In most currencies the serial number is printed on two edges of the banknotes to aggravate the making of so-called &quot;composed banknotes&quot; by combining parts of different banknotes. Even if made from genuine banknotes, most central banks consider such items as manipulated banknotes without value if the serial numbers do not match.

=== Tactile security features ===
==== Paper feeling ====
Security paper for banknotes is different from standard paper due to special ingredients like fibers from cotton, linen or abaca. Together with intaglio printing crisp feeling provides an excellent tactile perception (crisp feeling) to reject counterfeits which are based on standard paper with cellulose fibers. Polymer substrates and limp banknotes on paper substrate do not offer this tactile characteristic.

==== Intaglio printing ====

Intaglio printing is a technique in which the image is incised into a surface. Normally, copper or zinc plates are used, and the incisions are created by etching or engraving the image, but one may also use mezzotint. In printing, the surface is covered in ink, and then rubbed vigorously with tarlatan cloth or newspaper to remove the ink from the surface, leaving it in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink to the paper.

The very sharp printing obtained from the intaglio process is hard to imitate by other means. Intaglio also allows for the creation of latent images which are only visible when the document is viewed at a very shallow angle.

The mobile app &quot;ValiCash&quot; from Koenig &amp; Bauer evaluates specific characteristics of the intaglio printing of euro banknotes printed on paper substrate. It is available for iOS devices and takes a picture of the banknote. Within a few seconds it determines abnormality by a message &quot;not successful&quot; but cannot finally identify counterfeits.

==== Embossing ====
The substrate may be embossed to create raised designs as tactile security feature. It may be combined with intaglio printing. As an example, the euro series ES2 has different pattern of lines at the short edges of the banknote to support blind people in distinguishing the denominations.

== Security features detectable with simple tools ==

=== Test pen ===
A counterfeit banknote detection pen can be used to quickly determine the starch in wood-based paper substrate. While genuine banknotes hardly change color at all, counterfeits turn black or blue immediately. This method, which is not very reliable – there is no color change on newsprint – is often used in the retail trade for reasons of cost and time.

=== Halo ===
Carefully created images can be hidden in the background or in a picture on a document. These images cannot be seen without the help of an inexpensive lens of a specific line screening. When placed over the location of the image and rotated the image becomes visible. If the document is photocopied the Halo image is lost. A known implementation is &quot;Scrambled Indicia&quot;.

Halo can be printed on traditional or digital presses. The advantage of traditional presses is that multiple images can be overlaid in the same location and become visible in turn as the lens is rotated.

Halo is used as a technique to authenticate the originality of the document and may be used to verify critical information within the document. For example, the value of a coupon might be encoded as a Halo image that could be verified at the time of redemption or similarly the seat number on a sporting event ticket.

=== Latent images ===
Pressure-sensitive or hot stamped labels characterized with a normal (gray or colored) appearance. When viewed via a special filter (such as a polarizer) an additional, normally latent, image appears. With intaglio printing, a similar effect may be achieved for viewing the banknote from a slanted angle.

=== False-positive testing ===
False-positive testing derives its name because the testing requires both a false and a positive reaction to authenticate a document. The most common instance is the widely available counterfeit detector marker seen in many banks and stores.

Counterfeit detector markers use a chemical interaction with the substrate, usually paper, of a document turning it a particular color. Usually a marker turns newsprint black and leaves currency or specially treated areas on a document clear or gold. The reaction and coloring varies depending upon the formulation. Banknotes, being a specially manufactured substrate, usually behave differently than standard newsprint or other paper and this difference is how counterfeits are detected by the markers.

False-positive testing can also be done on documents other than currencies as a means to test their authenticity. With the stroke of a marker a symbol, word or value can be revealed that will allow the user to quickly verify the document, such as a coupon. In more advanced applications the marker creates a barcode which can be scanned for verification or reference to other data within the document resulting in a higher degree of assurance of authenticity.

Photocopied documents will lack the special characteristics of the substrate so are easily detectable. False-positive testing generally is a one time test because once done the results remain visible so while useful as part of a coupon this technique is not suitable for ID badges for example.

=== Fluorescent dyes ===
Fluorescent dyes react with fluorescence under ultraviolet light or other unusual lighting. These show up as words, patterns or pictures and may be visible or invisible under normal lighting. This feature is also incorporated into many banknotes and other documents - e.g. Northern Ireland NHS prescriptions show a picture of local &#x27;8th wonder&#x27; the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in UV light. Some producers include multi-frequency fluorescence, such that different elements fluoresce under specific frequencies of light. Phosphorescence may accompany fluorescence and shows an after-glow when the UV light is switched off.

=== Infrared characteristics ===
Inks may have identical color characteristics in the visible spectrum but differ in the infrared spectrum.

== Machine-readable security features ==
Machine-readable features are used in passports for border control and in banknote processing.
* The commercial market is using &quot;Level 2 features&quot; (L2) which are partly disclosed by the central banks. This applies for cash handling machines, such as automated teller machines and ticket machines.
* The central banks are additionally using &quot;Level 3 features&quot; (L3) which are kept completely secret. They are necessary to maintain the integrity of cash in circulation and isolate professional counterfeiting.

There are the following machine-readable features (extract):

=== Magnetic ink ===
Because of the speed with which they can be read by computer systems, magnetic ink character recognition is used extensively in banking, primarily for personal checks. The ink used in magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) technology is also used to greatly reduce errors in automated (or computerized) reading. The pigment is dispersed in a binder system (resin, solvent) or a wax compound and applied either by pressing or by hot melt to a carrier film (usually polyethylene).

Some people believe that the magnetic ink was intended as a fraud prevention concept, yet the original intent was to have a non-optical technology so that writing on the cheque, like signatures, would not interfere with reading. The main magnetic fonts (E13-B and CMC7) are downloadable for a small fee and in addition magnetic toner is available for many printers. Some higher resolution toners have sufficient magnetic properties for magnetic reading to be successful without special toner.

=== Phosphorescent dyes ===
Phosphorescence may accompany fluorescence and shows an after-glow when the UV light is switched off.

=== Anti-copying marks ===
In the late twentieth century advances in computer and photocopy technology made it possible for people without sophisticated training to easily copy currency. In an attempt to prevent this, banks have sought to add filtering features to the software and hardware available to the public that senses features of currency, and then locks out the reproduction of any material with these marks. One known example of such a system is the EURion constellation.
=== Electronic devices ===
With the advent of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) which is based on smart card technology, it is possible to insert extremely small RF-active devices into the printed product to enhance document security. This is most apparent in modern biometric passports, where an RFID chip mirrors the printed information. Biometric passports additionally include data for the verification of an individual&#x27;s fingerprint or face recognition at automated border control gates.

=== Copy detection pattern and digital watermark ===
A copy detection pattern or a digital watermark can be inserted into a digital image before printing the security document. These security features are designed to be copy-sensitive and authenticated with an imaging device.

=== Level 3 features ===
Most central banks also implement so-called &quot;Level 3&quot; (L3) security features which are kept totally secret for their ingredients as well as their sophisticated measurement. Such covert features may be embedded within the substrate and/or the printing ink and are not commercially available. They are the ultimate safeguard in banknote security and restricted to the use of central banks. The machine-readable &quot;M-Feature&quot; from Giesecke+Devrient is the worldwide leading L3 feature and currently used by more than 70 central banks and more than 100 billion banknotes in circulation. Other products are &quot;ENIGMA&quot; from De La Rue and &quot;Level III Authentication&quot; from Spectra Systems.

<doc id="650911" wikidata="Q21177" url="?curid=650911" title="Cirsium vulgare">
<text>Cirsium vulgare, the spear thistle, bull thistle, or common thistle, is a species of the Asteraceae genus &quot;Cirsium&quot;, native throughout most of Europe (north to 66°N, locally 68°N), Western Asia (east to the Yenisei Valley), and northwestern Africa (Atlas Mountains). It is also naturalised in North America, Africa, and Australia and is an invasive weed in several regions. It is the national flower of Scotland.

The plant provides a great deal of nectar for pollinators. It was rated in the top 10 for most nectar production (nectar per unit cover per year) in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative. Marsh thistle, &quot;Cirsium palustre&quot;, was ranked in first place while this thistle was ranked in sixth place. It also was a top producer of nectar sugar in another study in Britain, ranked third with a production per floral unit of (2300 ± 400 μg).

==Description==
It is a tall biennial or short-lived monocarpic thistle, forming a rosette of leaves and a taproot up to 70 cm (28 in) long in the first year, and a flowering stem 1–1.5 m (3 ft 4 in - 4 ft 11 in) tall in the second (rarely third or fourth) year. It can grow up to tall. It sometimes will function as an annual, flowering in the first year. The stem is winged, with numerous longitudinal spine-tipped wings along its full length. The leaves are stoutly spined, grey-green, deeply lobed; the basal leaves grow up to long, with smaller leaves on the upper part of the flower stem; the leaf lobes are spear-shaped (from which the English name derives). The inflorescence is diameter, pink-purple, with all the florets of similar form (no division into disc and ray florets). The seeds are long, with a downy pappus, which assists in wind dispersal. As in other species of &quot;Cirsium&quot; (but unlike species in the related genus &quot;Carduus&quot;), the pappus hairs are feathery with fine side hairs.

==Ecology==
Spear thistle is often a ruderal species, colonising bare disturbed ground, but also persists well on heavily grazed land as it is unpalatable to most grazing animals. Nitrogen-rich soils help increase its proliferation. The flowers are a rich nectar source used by numerous pollinating insects, including honey bees, wool-carder bees, and many butterflies. The seeds are eaten by goldfinches, linnets and greenfinches. The seeds are dispersed by wind, mud, water, and possibly also by ants; they do not show significant long-term dormancy, most germinating soon after dispersal and only a few lasting up to four years in the soil seed bank. Seed is also often spread by human activity such as hay bales.

===Weed status===
Spear thistle is designated an &quot;injurious weed&quot; under the UK Weeds Act 1959, and a noxious weed in Australia and in nine US states. Spread is only by seed, not by root fragments as in the related creeping thistle &quot;C. arvense&quot;. It is best cleared from land by hoeing and deep cutting of the taproot before seeds mature; regular cultivation also prevents its establishment.

Despite this label, the plant has beneficial qualities beyond its very high nectar production. It produces seeds eaten by the American goldfinch, down from seed pods that is used by those birds for nesting material. However, despite this serving generalist pollinators and animals, it is highly recommended to plant native thistles and other plants as it can wreak havoc on natural ecosystems.

==Other names==
Common names include bull thistle, Scots, Scottish, or Scotch thistle, and common thistle.

==Uses==
The stems can be peeled (removing their spiny surfaces) and then steamed or boiled. The tap roots can be eaten raw or cooked, but are only palatable on young thistles that have not yet flowered. The dried florets steeped in water are used in rural Italy for curdling goats&#x27; milk in preparation for making cheese.. In Iran, cleaned stems are used in the dish Khoresh-e-Kangar (thistle stem stew).

==In culture==
The plant features in some Scottish ceremonies such as the &quot;Riding of the Marches&quot;, held annually in Langholm in July. The 1992 specimen measured six feet in length.

Spear thistle is also the emblem of Newton Regis in England.

<text>A semi-submersible platform is a specialised marine vessel used in offshore roles including as offshore drilling rigs, safety vessels, oil production platforms, and heavy lift cranes. They have good ship stability and seakeeping, better than drillships.

==Characteristics==
Offshore drilling in water depth greater than around requires that operations be carried out from a floating vessel, since fixed structures are not practical. Initially in the early 1950s monohull ships such as CUSS I were used, but these were found to have significant heave, pitch and yaw motions in large waves, and the industry needed more stable drilling platforms.

A semi-submersible obtains most of its buoyancy from ballasted, watertight pontoons located below the ocean surface and wave action. Structural columns connect the pontoons and operating deck. The operating deck can be located high above the sea level owing to the good ship stability of the design, and therefore is kept well away from the waves.

With its hull structure submerged at a deep draft, the semi-submersible is less affected by wave loadings than a normal ship. With a small water-plane area, however, the semi-submersible is sensitive to load changes, and therefore must have their onboard mass trimmed to maintain stability. Unlike a submersible, a semi-submersible vessel is not supported by resting on the seabed.

Semi-submersible vessels are able to transform from a deep to a shallow draft by deballasting (removing ballast water from the hull), thereby becoming surface vessels. Usually they are moved from location to location in this configuration. The heavy lift vessels use this capability to submerge the majority of their structure, locate beneath another floating vessel, and then deballast to pick up the other vessel as a cargo.

==Early history==

The semi-submersible design was first developed for oil platform activities in the early 1960s. Bruce Collipp of Shell is regarded as the inventor.

However, Edward Robert Armstrong may have paved the way with his idea of &quot;seadrome&quot; landing strips for airplanes in the late 1920s, since his idea involved the same use of columns on ballast tanks below the surface and anchored to the ocean floor by steel cables.

The first jackup rigs, for shallow waters, was built in 1954.

The first semisubmersible arrived by accident in 1961. Blue Water Drilling Company owned and operated the four column submersible drilling rig &quot;Blue Water Rig No.1&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico for Shell Oil Company. As the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables, it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck. It was observed that the motions at this draught were very small, and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided that the rig could be operated in the floating mode.

The first purpose built drilling semi-submersible &quot;Ocean Driller&quot; was launched in 1963.

By 1972, there were 30 semi-submersible units.

==Classification==
Drilling rig construction has historically occurred in boom periods and therefore &quot;batches&quot; of drilling rigs have been built. Offshore drilling rigs have been loosely classified in nominal &quot;generations&quot; depending upon the year built and water depth capability as follows:

==Applications==

===s ()===
Semi-submersible rigs make stable platforms for drilling for offshore oil and gas. They can be towed into position by a tugboat and anchored, or moved by and kept in position by their own azimuth thrusters with dynamic positioning.

The International Maritime Organization MODU Code is an accredited design and operational guideline for mobile offshore drilling units of the semi-submersible type.

===s ()===


The advantages of the semi-submersible vessel stability were soon recognized for offshore construction when in 1978 Heerema Marine Contractors constructed the two sister crane vessels called &quot;Balder&quot; and &quot;Hermod&quot;. These semi-submersible crane vessels (SSCV) consist of two lower hulls (pontoons), three columns on each pontoon and an upper hull. Shortly after J. Ray McDermott and Saipem also introduced SSCVs, resulting in two new enormous vessels &quot;DB-102&quot; (now &quot;Thialf&quot;) and &quot;Saipem 7000&quot;, capable of lifting respectively 14,200 and 14,000 tons.

During transit an SSCV is de-ballasted to a draught where only part of the lower hull is submerged. During lifting operations, the vessel is ballasted down. This way, the lower hull is well submerged. This reduces the effect of waves and swell. High stability is obtained by placing the columns far apart. The high stability allows them to lift extremely high loads safely.

===s ()===
Semi-submersibles are particularly suited to a number of offshore support vessel roles because of their good stability, large deck areas, and variable deck load (VDL).

Notable vessels are as follows:

*&quot;Transocean Marianas&quot; – Offshore safety support vessel, built in 1979 and since converted into a drilling vessel, and rechristened &quot;Transocean Marianas&quot;
*&quot;Iolair&quot; – Offshore safety support vessel, built for BP in 1982, Sedco/Phillips SS was the first built to Red Adair&#x27;s recommendations. &quot;Iolair&quot; followed.
*&quot;Q4000&quot; – Offshore multiservice vessel, built for Caldive in 2002

===s===
When oil fields were first developed in offshore locations, drilling semi-submersibles were converted for use as combined drilling and production platforms. These vessels offered very stable and cost effective platforms. The first semi-submersible floating production platform was the &quot;Argyll FPF&quot; converted from the &quot;Transworld 58&quot; drilling semi-submersible in 1975 for the Hamilton Brothers North Sea Argyll oil field.

As the oil industry progressed into deeper water and harsh environments, purpose-built production semi-submersible platforms were designed. The first purpose-built semi-submersible production platform was for the Balmoral field in the UK North Sea in 1986.

Notable platforms are as follows:

* Petrobras 36 – Converted from drilling rig Spirit of Columbus and sank in 2001
* Atlantis PQ – BP and BHP joint venture
* Thunder Horse PDQ – GVA40000 design, largest semi-submersible platform

=== Offshore rocket launch and landing platform ===
&quot;Ocean Odyssey&quot; was converted from a mobile drilling rig to a launch platform in 1997. In total, 36 rockets were launched from the platform. The last launch happened in 2014, shortly before its owner Sea Launch significantly reduced all operations.

The potential application of converted semi-submersible oil drilling rigs is being explored by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) for launching and landing of Starship. SpaceX has acquired two former offshore oil drilling rigs in 2021, similar to the ENSCO/Valaris 8506 offshore model, but later sold them in 2023 after they were considered unsuitable.

<text>Cirsium palustre, the marsh thistle or European swamp thistle, is a herbaceous biennial (or often perennial) flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.

== Description ==
&quot;Cirsium palustre&quot; is a tall thistle which reaches up to in height. The strong stems have few branches and are covered in small spines. In its first year the plant grows as a dense rosette, at first with narrow, entire leaves with spiny, dark purple edges; later, larger leaves are lobed. In the subsequent years the plant grows a tall, straight stem, the tip of which branches repeatedly, bearing a candelabra of dark purple flowers, with purple-tipped bracts. In the northern hemisphere these are produced from June to September. The flowers are occasionally white, in which case the purple edges to the leaves are absent.

== Ecology ==
The plant provides a great deal of nectar for pollinators. It was rated first out of the top 10 for most nectar production (nectar per unit cover per year) in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative.

It is native to Europe where it is particularly common on damp ground such as marshes, wet fields, moorland and beside streams. In Canada and the northern United States, it is an introduced species that has become invasive. It grows in dense thickets that can crowd out slower growing native plants.

&quot;Cirsium palustre&quot; is broadly distributed throughout much of Europe and eastward to central Asia. This thistle&#x27;s occurrence is linked to the spread of human agriculture from the mid-Holocene era or before. It is a constant plant of several fen-meadow plant associations, including the &quot;Juncus subnodulosus&quot;-&quot;Cirsium palustre&quot; fen-meadow.
The flowers are visited by a wide variety of insects, featuring a generalised pollination syndrome.

<text>Tina Charles (born Tina Hoskins; 10 March 1954) is an English singer who achieved success as a disco artist in the mid to late 1970s. Her most successful single was the UK no. 1 hit &quot;I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)&quot; in 1976.

==Early life==
Charles was born Tina Hoskins in Whitechapel, London, to actor Charles Hoskins and his wife Hilda. She recovered from meningitis as a newborn. She has a brother, Warren, who was her tour manager during the height of her career. 

==Career==
Charles began her career as a backing singer and session musician, and recorded her first solo single in 1969 with a then-unknown Elton John playing piano. During the early 1970s, she supplied vocals for the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; album series of cover versions of contemporary hits. In 1971, she made appearances in the first series of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, the BBC1 sketch show starring Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett, performing songs such as &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; and &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;.

In 1975, Charles and her friend Linda Lewis were backing vocalists on the Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel chart topping song, &quot;Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)&quot;. Charles provided the lead vocals for 5000 Volts&#x27; 1975 disco hit single &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;. Although not publicly acknowledged as a group member at the time due to contractual problems, Charles was considered to have a stronger voice than the group&#x27;s later official lead singers. The song reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart, and 26 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Charles&#x27; big break came soon after in 1975, when Indian-British composer/producer Biddu, who had just enjoyed success with the disco song &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; for Carl Douglas, produced the singles &quot;You Set My Heart on Fire&quot; and &quot;I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)&quot; for her. The latter single spent three weeks at number one on the UK chart in March 1976, and was a major hit around the world. It won a Juno Award in 1977.

Biddu&#x27;s collaboration continued on a future album and another song hit: &quot;Dance Little Lady Dance&quot;. In total, Charles spent 42 weeks on the UK Singles Chart in 1976 alone, mainly due to these two records. During this time, her touring band included Trevor Horn (for a while her boyfriend), Geoff Downes, and Bruce Woolley.

Further hits, including &quot;Love Me Like a Lover&quot;, &quot;Dr Love&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous&quot; and &quot;Love Bug&quot;, made her a pop star in Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, but she was never able to achieve success in the US. Her only solo recording to chart significantly in the US was &quot;You Set My Heart on Fire&quot;, which reached number 3 on &quot;Record World&quot; magazine&#x27;s &#x27;Disco File Top 20&#x27; chart in the autumn of 1975.

In 1978, Charles was a joint winner at the World Popular Song Festival held in Tokyo, performing the tune &quot;Love Rocks&quot;. Charles represented the UK, and shared the top prize with Japan&#x27;s own entry.

By 1980, her career was in decline, and disco music generally was losing some of its public appeal. She attempted to change her disco style for her 1980 album &quot;Just One Smile&quot; for a more hard edge rock electronic style but the album was virtually ignored. Charles married and had a child, and devoted herself for some years to her family life, putting her singing career on hold. In the mid-1980s, she had a resurgence with a remix of &quot;I Love to Love&quot; which was produced by longtime friend and associate Sanny X.

Since 2000, Charles has performed throughout Europe, where disco music and her hit singles have been reappraised, and she has become a popular live performer. Charles featured in the Top 5 of the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart with &quot;Higher&quot; in 2006. The song was produced by Sanny X. She made a guest appearance with The Producers at their 2007 concert, singing &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;. In October 2007, Charles recorded &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; with producer Ian Levine for the album &quot;Disco 2008&quot;. Her latest album, &quot;Listen 2 the Music&quot;, was released in March 2008.

In 2010, Charles was signed by the British writer and producer Carl M Cox to his PMG Music production and record label. Other notable acts that have been signed by Cox&#x27;s label are Sinitta and Amanda Lear. Charles&#x27; first single with PMG, &quot;Your Love Is My Light&quot;, was released physically on 7 November 2011 and digitally on 14 November. Also in 2010, she went on tour with 5000 Volts, the band with which she experienced her first hit record.

==Personal life==
Charles married Bernard Webb in 1977, and they divorced in 1979. Their son, Max, was born in London in June 1977. She married Tetoo Hassan in 1993. They lived in Caterham, Surrey, England. Hassan died of cancer in 2013. In 2015, she married David Fancourt. In 2016, they lived in Surrey.

<text>Cirsium oleraceum, the cabbage thistle or Siberian thistle, is a species of thistle in the genus &quot;Cirsium&quot; within the family Asteraceae, native to central and eastern Europe and Asia, where it grows in wet lowland soils.

&quot;Cirsium oleraceum&quot; is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 1.5 m tall, the stems unbranched or with only a very few branches. The leaves are broad and ovoid, with a weakly spiny margin, being pinnatipartite. The flowers are produced in dense flower heads which are 2.5–4 cm diameter, pale yellow, but sometimes tinged pink.

Its specific epithet &quot;oleraceum&quot; means &quot;vegetable/herbal&quot; in Latin and is a form of ().

==Distribution==

It is found native throughout Europe, with the exception of Portugal, Albania, North Macedonia, Greece, Crimea, Ciscaucasia, Povolzhye, and the Mediterranean islands. It is found naturalised in the British Isles, Finland, and Central Siberia. It is also native to West Siberia, the Altai, and Kazakhstan.

==Usage==
For cooking: 
In salads the young stems and leaves are edible, and cultivated for food in Japan and India.

<text>Electrophilic substitution reactions are chemical reactions in which an electrophile displaces a functional group in a compound, which is typically, but not always, aromatic. Aromatic substitution reactions are characteristic of aromatic compounds and are common ways of introducing functional groups into benzene rings. Some aliphatic compounds can undergo electrophilic substitution as well.

== Electrophilic aromatic substitution ==
In electrophilic substitution in aromatic compounds, an atom appended to the aromatic ring, usually hydrogen, is replaced by an electrophile.
The most important reactions of this type that take place are aromatic nitration, aromatic halogenation, aromatic sulfonation and acylation and alkylating Friedel-Crafts reactions.
It further consists of alkylation and acylation.

== Electrophilic aliphatic substitution ==

In electrophilic substitution in aliphatic compounds, an electrophile displaces a functional group. This reaction is similar to nucleophilic aliphatic substitution where the reactant is a nucleophile rather than an electrophile. The four possible electrophilic aliphatic substitution reaction mechanisms are SE1, SE2(front), SE2(back) and SEi (Substitution Electrophilic), which are also similar to the nucleophile counterparts SN1 and SN2. In the SE1 course of action the substrate first ionizes into a carbanion and a positively charged organic residue. The carbanion then quickly recombines with the electrophile. The SE2 reaction mechanism has a single transition state in which the old bond and the newly formed bond are both present.

Electrophilic aliphatic substitution reactions are: 
* Nitrosation
* Ketone halogenation
* Keto-enol tautomerism
* Aliphatic diazonium coupling
* Carbene insertion into C-H bonds
* Carbonyl alpha-substitution reactions

<text>Ghost Dad is a 1990 American fantasy comedy film directed by Sidney Poitier (in his final directorial effort) and starring Bill Cosby, in which a widower&#x27;s spirit is able to communicate with his children after his death. It was a box office disaster. The film was nominated for three Young Artist Awards.

==Plot==
Elliot Hopper (Bill Cosby) is a workaholic widower who is about to land the deal of a lifetime at work, which he hopes will win him a promotion and a company car. After he forgets his daughter Diane&#x27;s birthday, he attempts to make it up to her by promising her she can have his car when he secures the deal at work on the coming Thursday. After being persuaded to give the car to his daughter early, Elliot must hail a taxi from work, which is driven by Satanist Curtis Burch (Raynor Scheine), who drives erratically and is out of control. Attempting to get the taxi stopped, Elliot announces that he is Satan and commands him to stop the taxi, and also attempts to give him his wallet. Shocked to see his &quot;Evil Master&quot;, Burch drives off a bridge and into the river.

Elliot emerges from the accident scene, only to learn that he is a ghost when a police officer fails to notice him and a speeding bus goes straight through him. When he gets home he discovers that his three children can see him, but only in a totally dark room, and they cannot hear him at times. He struggles to tell them what happened when he is whisked away to London by paranormal researcher Sir Edith Moser (Ian Bannen), who tells him he is a ghost who has yet to enter the afterlife because &quot;they screwed up&quot;; his soul will not cross over until Thursday.

The pressures of work and family life lead to many comedic events, as Elliot attempts to renew his life insurance policy and complete his company&#x27;s merger, so his family will be provided for once he crosses over. One day, he must choose between staying in an important work meeting and helping his son Danny with a magic trick at school. He eventually decides that his family&#x27;s happiness is more important and walks out on his furious boss, Mr. Collins (Barry Corbin), who later smugly fires him. Dejected, Elliot reveals himself as a ghost to his love interest, Joan (Denise Nicholas), whose initial shock soon turns to sympathy.

Edith arrives from London to announce that Elliot is not dead; his spirit jumped out of his body in fright. They also work out that the only previous known case of this happening was Elliot&#x27;s father. In the excitement to find Elliot&#x27;s body to reunite his spirit with it, Diane trips on a pair of skates that her little sister, Amanda, left on the stairs; she falls and is seriously injured. The family rush her to the hospital where her spirit has also jumped out of her body. As she delightedly flies around, Elliot begs her to re-enter her body; his own has started to &quot;flicker&quot;. When he collapses, Diane becomes concerned and races into the intensive-care unit to find her father&#x27;s body. She helps him into the room and they discover that Burch had swapped wallets with Elliot, meaning Elliot was wrongly identified by the hospital as Burch. Elliot returns to his body and wakes up; Diane does the same and jumps off the operating table to tell the family what has happened.

As the reunited family leave the hospital, Elliot spots a yellow taxi parked outside and goes to look inside. He sees Curtis Burch behind the wheel. Delighted to see his &quot;Evil Master&quot;, Burch returns Elliot&#x27;s wallet and tells Elliot he will do whatever Elliot commands. Elliot commands Burch to go to hell and sit on red-hot coals waiting for him &quot;&quot;. Curtis agrees enthusiastically and drives off while Elliot, Joan, Edith, and the family leave the hospital.

==Cast==
==Pre-production==
Early in development, John Badham was slated to direct the film with Steve Martin as Elliot Hopper. Badham and Martin left the project for unknown reasons, and Universal hired Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby to be their respective replacements.

==Novelization==
As part of the publicity for the movie, a &quot;Ghost Dad&quot; novelization written by Mel Cebulash was released the year of the film&#x27;s debut.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 6% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 3.30/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;A startlingly misconceived effort from director Sidney Poitier and star Bill Cosby, &quot;Ghost Dad&quot; is a listless, glacially-paced comedy that&#x27;s alternately schmaltzy and incomprehensible.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Rating the movie half a star out of four, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert characterized it as &quot;a desperately unfunny film—a strained, contrived construction that left me shaking my head in amazement [ . . . ] How could Sidney Poitier, a skilled filmmaker with an actor&#x27;s sense of timing, have been the director of this mess? How did a production executive go for it? Who ever thought this was a good idea? Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;unctuous, flat and phony, a farce that has the pace of a Broadway bus at rush hour.&quot;

===Box office===
In the film&#x27;s opening weekend, it earned $4,803,480. Domestically the film earned $24,707,633 and $714,000 at the international box office for a total of $25,421,633.

==Home media==
&quot;Ghost Dad&quot; was released on VHS by MCA/Universal Home Video on December 6, 1990. The film was released on DVD by Good Times Video on May 1, 2001, and as a &quot;Studio Selections&quot; DVD by Universal Studios on March 1, 2005.

==TV version==
12 minutes&#x27; worth of deleted scenes were shown on television on NBC and on USA Network.

==Modern references==
On November 1, 2000, &quot;Ghost Dad&quot; was parodied in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ &quot;Treehouse of Horror XI&quot;, in which Homer Simpson died after consuming broccoli and was required to perform one good deed within 24 hours in order to not be sentenced to an eternity in Hell.

In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Brian Does Hollywood&quot;, Stewie appears on an episode of &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot;, Cosby&#x27;s show. When Cosby inadvertently hypnotizes Stewie with his own device, Stewie says &quot;&quot;Ghost Dad&quot; was the best movie I&#x27;ve seen since &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot;&quot;, referencing another infamous flop Cosby made.

In the video game &quot;Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden&quot;, published in January 2008, the protagonist is required to fight and slay &quot;Ghost Dad&quot;, who has been terrorizing the ruins of Proto-Neo-New York, in order to lift the fog bank that prevents passage to the Spalding Building. He is featured as a ghost with Bill Cosby&#x27;s face superimposed shoddily onto its body.

In the &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; episode &quot;Crawl Space&quot;, Bob answers questions for Louise&#x27;s friends while acting as a ghost trapped in the walls. One of her friends asks him if he&#x27;s &quot;the ghost dad from &quot;Ghost Dad&quot;.&quot;

The film was reviewed in an early 2014 episode of &quot;Nostalgia Critic&quot;.

<doc id="650926" wikidata="Q3684744" url="?curid=650926" title="National Caucus of Labor Committees">
<text>The National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC) is a political organization in the United States founded and controlled by political activist Lyndon LaRouche until his 2019 death. LaRouche sometimes described the NCLC as a &quot;philosophical association&quot;. It is the main organization within the LaRouche movement. LaRouche was the association&#x27;s leader, and the political views of the NCLC are virtually indistinguishable from those of LaRouche.

The highest group within the NCLC is the National Executive Committee (NEC), described as the &quot;inner leadership circle&quot;, or &quot;an elite circle of insiders&quot;, which &quot;oversees policy&quot;. The next most senior group is the National Committee (NC), which is reportedly &quot;one step beneath the NEC&quot;.

==History==

===Formation===
The NCLC had it origins in the 1968 convention of the Students for a Democratic Society. It comprised people who had been expelled from the Maoist Progressive Labor Party, an SDS faction, and students from Columbia University in New York City. It called itself the &quot;SDS Labor Committee&quot; or the &quot;National Caucus of SDS Labor Committees&quot;. Led by LaRouche, it included &quot;New Left lieutenants&quot; Ed Spannaus, Nancy Spannaus, and Tony Papert, as well as Paul Milkman, Paul Gallagher, Leif Johnson, Tony Chaitkin, and Steve Fraser. The Labor Committee was known for promoting a &quot;socialist re-industrialization&quot; of the economy, combined with confiscatory taxes on what it saw as wasteful and parasitic investment. It was expelled from SDS for taking the side of the teachers&#x27; union in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike. It was originally a New Left organization influenced by Trotskyist ideas as well as those of other Marxists such as Rosa Luxemburg, but opposed other New Left organizations which LaRouche said were dominated by the Ford Foundation, Institute for Policy Studies and Herbert Marcuse.

The organization became the NCLC in January 1969. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, LaRouche writes in his autobiography that in 1971 the NCLC formed &quot;intelligence units&quot;, and the following year started training members in paramilitary tactics.

===Operation Mop Up===
According to &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the NCLC became embroiled in the early 1970s in conflicts with other leftist groups, culminating in &quot;Operation Mop-Up,&quot; which consisted of a series of physical attacks on members of rival left wing groups.
During &quot;Operation Mop-Up,&quot; LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;New Solidarity&quot; reported NCLC confrontations with members of the Communist Party and Socialist Workers Party. One incident took place April 23, 1973 at a debate featuring Labor Committee mayoral candidate Tony Chaitkin. The meeting erupted in a brawl, with chairs flying. Six people were treated for injuries at a local hospital. Following this incident, &quot;New Solidarity&quot; warned:

The clown show is over. The Labor Committee warns the Socialist Workers Party and its comrades-in-hysteria: when you did all the fighting for the Communist Party at the mayoral forum, we held back – we gave you a mild warning, though several of your members were bloodied and broken. But should you repeat as goons for the CP, we will put all of you in the hospital; we will deal with you as we are dealing with the Communist Party.

In November 1973, the FBI issued an internal memorandum that was later released under the Freedom of Information Act. Jeffrey Steinberg, LaRouche spokesperson and NCLC &quot;director of counterintelligence&quot;, described it as the &quot;COINTELPRO memo&quot;, which he says showed &quot;that the FBI was considering supporting an assassination attempt against LaRouche by the Communist Party USA.&quot; LaRouche wrote in 1998:
The U.S. Communist Party was committed to putting the Labor Committees out of existence physically... Local law enforcement was curiously uncooperative, as they had been during prior physical attacks on myself and my friends. We knew that a &#x27;fix&#x27; was in somewhere, probably from the FBI... We were left to our own resources. Tired of the beatings, we decided we had better prepare to defend ourselves if necessary.

===1974–1986===
By the mid-1970s, the NCLC had abandoned Marxism altogether, in favor of what its members described as an American System approach. Press accounts describe shift to the right, with the NCLC establishing ties to the Ku Klux Klan and the Liberty Lobby. The conservative Heritage Foundation issued a report which states that &quot;neither the Left nor the Right has a thoroughly-documented explanation of the organization&#x27;s nature or purposes.&quot;

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, LaRouche said he met with representatives of the Soviet Union at the United Nations in 1974 and 1975 in order to discuss attacks by the Communist Party USA on the NCLC, and to propose that the CPUSA should be merged into the NCLC. He denied receiving any assistance from the Soviets.

The NCLC established a paramilitary &quot;officers training camp&quot; in Argyle, New York in 1974, according to an FBI report. Members learned about &quot;small unit tactics and strategy&quot;, and trained with nunchaku. The FBI documents reportedly also mention &quot;beatings&quot; and &quot;brainwashings&quot;, claim that the group moved from far-left to far-right, and complain that NCLC sent in tips about wild conspiracies.
In 1974, NCLC members admitted they had been harassing FBI agents for years.

According to LaRouche in 1995, during the period 1976-1978 the NCLC ceased being a dues-paying membership organization, and made the transition to a &quot;purely philosophical-legal organization,&quot; whose principal activities were either philosophical or in connection with legal cases against the COINTELPRO and related offenses of the FBI and associated agencies.

In 1977, Costas Axios, NCLC chief of staff for New York, said of the NCLC: &quot;We are socialist, but first we must establish an industrialist capitalist republic and rid this country of the Rockefeller anti-industrial, antitechnology monetarist dictatorship of today.&quot; According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, FBI memoranda of the time described the NCLC as a &quot;clandestinely oriented group of political schizophrenics who have a paranoid preoccupation with Nelson Rockefeller and the CIA&quot;, and as a &quot;violence-oriented Marxist revolutionary organization.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that by 1981, the NCLC was overseeing a network of companies and organizations that were budgeted to bring in $11.7 million in gross receipts annually. One company, Campaigner Publications Inc., was reported to have grossed $4.5 million in a four-month period. In a purported internal memo from 1981 LaRouche explained his position within the organization by saying, &quot;I do not wish to hear, ever again, that I must wait until our legal council (sic) has assessed the wisdom of one of my decisions or that some members personal sensitivities must be taken into account...I promise you that I shall function, unrestrained, as a commanding general of a combat organization. Anyone who opposes my orders will, in the moral sense, be shot on the spot for insubordination.&quot;

In 1984 the headquarters were moved from Manhattan to Leesburg, Virginia, a suburb of Washington D.C.

The NCLC was indicted on charges of obstruction of justice in 1986 and its offices were searched. Federal prosecutors alleged that LaRouche &quot;dominates and controls&quot; the NCLC. A U.S. government memo reportedly said that &quot;the primary purpose&quot; of the NCLC is to support LaRouche in a lavish lifestyle and to &quot;courier large sums of cash to secret depositories.&quot; Over a dozen NCLC members, including LaRouche himself, were eventually indicted. (See also LaRouche criminal trials)

==Electoral politics==

The NCLC launched the U.S. Labor Party (USLP), a registered political party, in 1972 as its electoral arm and ran LaRouche for President of the United States on the USLP ticket in 1976 along with numerous candidates for lower office.

In 1979 LaRouche changed his political strategy to one of running in Democratic primaries rather than as a third party candidate. This resulted in the USLP being replaced by the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC,) a political action committee unassociated with the Democratic National Committee.

==International work==

The International Caucus of Labor Committees (ICLC) was founded as the philosophical nucleus for LaRouche movement operations worldwide. According to LaRouche the ICLC follows the &quot;model of American
founding father Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &#x27;Junto&#x27; organization.&quot;

The ICLC has affiliates in Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Denmark, and Sweden, Australia, Philippines, along with Mexico and several South American countries.

<text>The Brigantes were Ancient Britons who in pre-Roman times controlled the largest section of what would become Northern England. Their territory, often referred to as Brigantia, was centred in what was later known as Yorkshire. The Greek geographer Ptolemy named the Brigantes as a people in Ireland also, where they could be found around what is now counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Waterford, while another people named &quot;Brigantii&quot; is mentioned by Strabo as a sub-tribe of the Vindelici in the region of the Alps.

Within Britain, the territory which the Brigantes inhabited was bordered by that of four other peoples: the Carvetii in the northwest, the Parisii to the east and, to the south, the Corieltauvi and the Cornovii. To the north was the territory of the Votadini, which straddled the present day border between England and Scotland.

==Etymology==
The name ( in Ancient Greek) shares the same Proto-Celtic root as the goddess Brigantia, meaning &#x27;high, elevated&#x27;, and it is unclear whether settlements called were so named as &#x27;high ones&#x27; in a metaphorical sense of nobility, or literally as &#x27;highlanders&#x27;, or inhabitants of physically elevated fortifications. The reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root is . The word is related to Germanic and Iranian (Old Iranian ).

In modern Welsh, the word means &#x27;privilege, prestige&#x27; and comes from the same root . Other related forms from the modern Celtic languages are: Welsh &#x27;king&#x27; (&lt; ); Welsh/Cornish/Breton &#x27;prestige, reputation, honour, dignity&#x27;, Scottish Gaelic &#x27;pith, power&#x27;, Irish &#x27;energy, significance&#x27;, Manx &#x27;power, energy&#x27; (all &lt; ); and Welsh/Cornish/Breton &#x27;hill&#x27; (&lt; ). The name Bridget from Old Irish (Modern Irish ) also comes from , as does the English river name Brent and the connected area Brentford.

There were several ancient settlements named around Europe, corresponding to modern places (many with cognate names), including Berganza in Álava (Spain), A Coruña and Bergantiños in Galicia (Spain), Bragança and Braga in Portugal, Briançon in France, Brigetio on the border of Slovakia and Hungary, Brigobanne situated on the Breg River and near the Brigach river in south Germany (pre-Roman Vindelicia) Bregenz in the Austrian Alps, and Brianza in Italy.

In chronostratigraphy, the British sub-stage of the Carboniferous period, the Brigantian, derives its name from the Brigantes.

==History==

There are no written records of the Brigantes before the Roman conquest of Britain; it is therefore hard to assess how long they had existed as a political entity prior to that. Most key archaeological sites in the region seem to show continued, undisturbed occupation from an early date, so their rise to power may have been gradual rather than a sudden, dramatic conquest, or it may be linked to the burning of the large hill fort at Castle Hill, Huddersfield, c. 430 BC. Territorially the largest tribe in Britain, the Brigantes encompassed sub-tribes or septs such as the Gabrantovices on the Yorkshire Coast, and the Textoverdi in the upper valley of the River South Tyne near Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. The names &quot;Portus Setantiorum&quot; and &quot;Coria Lopocarum&quot; suggest other groups, the Setantii and the Lopocares located on the Lancashire coast and the River Tyne respectively. A name &quot;Corionototae&quot; is also recorded but since the name seems to derive from &quot;*Corion Toutas&quot; meaning &quot;tribal army&quot; or &quot;people&#x27;s army&quot; it may have been a name for a military force or resistance against the Romans rather than any tribe or sub-tribe. The Carvetii who occupied what is now Cumbria may have been another sub-tribe, or they may have been separate from the Brigantes. This is often disputed as the Carvetii made up a separate civitas under Roman rule.

===Roman era===
During the Roman invasion, in 47 AD, the governor of Britain, Publius Ostorius Scapula, was forced to abandon his campaign against the Deceangli of North Wales because of &quot;disaffection&quot; among the Brigantes, whose leaders had been allies of Rome. A few of those who had taken up arms were killed and the rest were pardoned. In 51, the defeated resistance leader Caratacus sought sanctuary with the Brigantian queen, Cartimandua, but she showed her loyalty to the Romans by handing him over in chains. She and her husband Venutius are described as loyal and &quot;defended by Roman arms&quot;, but they later divorced, Venutius taking up arms first against his ex-wife, then her Roman protectors. During the governorship of Aulus Didius Gallus (52–57) he gathered an army and invaded her kingdom. The Romans sent troops to defend Cartimandua, and they defeated Venutius&#x27; rebellion. After the divorce, Cartimandua married Venutius&#x27; armour-bearer, Vellocatus, and raised him to the kingship. Venutius staged another rebellion in 69, taking advantage of Roman instability in the Year of the Four Emperors. This time the Romans were only able to send auxiliaries, who succeeded in evacuating Cartimandua but left Venutius and his anti-Roman supporters in control of the kingdom.

The extensive Iron Age fortifications at Stanwick in North Yorkshire were excavated in the 1950s by Mortimer Wheeler who concluded that Venutius probably had this site as his capital, but Durham University&#x27;s later excavations from 1981 to 1986 led Colin Haselgrove and Percival Turnbull to suggest a slightly earlier dating with Stanwick a centre of power for Cartimandua instead.

After the accession of Vespasian, Quintus Petillius Cerialis was appointed governor of Britain and the conquest of the Brigantes was begun. It seems to have taken many decades to complete. Gnaeus Julius Agricola (governor 78–84) appears to have engaged in warfare in Brigantian territory. Tacitus, in a speech put into the mouth of the Caledonian leader Calgacus, refers to the Brigantes, &quot;under a woman&#x27;s leadership&quot;, almost defeating the Romans. The Roman poet Juvenal, writing in the early 2nd century, depicts a Roman father urging his son to win glory by destroying the forts of the Brigantes. There appears to have been a rebellion in the north sometime in the early reign of Hadrian, but details are unclear. A rising of the Brigantes has often been posited as the explanation for the disappearance of the Ninth Legion, stationed at York. It is possible that one of the purposes of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall (begun in 122) was to keep the Brigantes from making discourse with the tribes in what is now the lowlands of Scotland on the other side. The emperor Antoninus Pius (138–161) is said by Pausanias to have defeated them after they began an unprovoked war against Roman allies, perhaps as part of the campaign that led to the building of the Antonine Wall (142–144).

==Settlements==
Ptolemy named nine principal &quot;poleis&quot; (cities) or towns belonging to the Brigantes; these were:


Other settlements known in Brigantian territory include:

*Wincobank, on the border of Sheffield
*Bremetenacum Veteranorum (Ribchester, Lancashire)
*Calcaria (Tadcaster, North Yorkshire) – mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary and the Ravenna Cosmography
*Luguvalium (Carlisle, Cumbria) – probably a settlement of the Carvetii
*Coria (Corbridge, Northumberland) – perhaps a settlement of the Lopocares

==Brigantes in Ireland==
The Brigantes are attested in Ireland as well as Britain in Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd century &quot;Geographia&quot;, but it is not clear what link, if any, existed between the Irish and the British Brigantes. T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly proposed that the Irish branch was the origin of the later Uí Bairrche clan, believing that they belonged to the Érainn (Ptolemy&#x27;s Iverni) who he hypothesized were originally descendant from the Gaulish and British Belgae according to his model of Irish prehistory. Professor John T. Koch posits links between the British and Irish groups, identifying the Romano-British goddess Brigantia with the Irish Brigid and pointing to a possibly Roman or Romano-British burial in Stonyford, County Kilkenny. He identifies the Irish Brigantes with the early mediaeval Uí Brigte clan.

==In popular culture==
* The 2010 film &quot;Centurion&quot; follows the destiny of the Ninth Legion, seen from the perspective of centurion Quintus Dias. Both the Ninth and Dias become embroiled in the machinations of Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a Brigantes warrior, acting as a scout, when she subsequently betrays them to the Picts.
* In the 1954 novel &quot;The Eagle of the Ninth&quot; by Rosemary Sutcliff, one of the main characters is Esca, the captured son of a chieftain of the Brigantes, who travels with the Roman soldier Marcus Aquila north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall to discover what happened to the Legio IX Hispana. The character was played by Christian Rodska in the 1977 BBC adaptation and Jamie Bell in the 2011 film adaptation &quot;The Eagle&quot;.
* In 2020, the English rugby league club, Wigan Warriors, referenced a Brigantian warrior in their new club logo claiming that the Brigantes &quot;had roots and lineage in the town of Wigan&quot;.
* The 1982 science fiction novel &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;, by L. Ron Hubbard, includes a group of minor characters in the distant future who call themselves the Brigantes. They are presented as savage and treacherous bandit mercenaries and cannibals from Zimbabwe in Africa, led by a man called “Snith” but with no connection to the historical Brigantes other than descending from British colonists. The meaning of their name is never explained, but is possibly related to the word “brigand.”

<doc id="650931" wikidata="Q7968657" url="?curid=650931" title="War of Jennifer's Ear">
<text>The War of Jennifer&#x27;s Ear is the name given to a 1992 controversy in United Kingdom politics, between the opposition Labour Party and the governing Conservative Party. The name is an allusion to the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, an actual armed conflict of the 18th century.

==Election broadcast==
In the midst of the 1992 general election campaign, on 24 March, Labour ran a party election broadcast about a five-year-old girl with glue ear who waited a year for the simple operation to insert vents. This case was contrasted with the case of a girl a with a similar condition who was able to afford private treatment – of the kind that had been granted tax breaks by the Conservatives – and was able to resolve her problem quickly. The party highlighted the alleged mismanagement and underfunding of the National Health Service (NHS) under the Conservative government. Labour leader Neil Kinnock employed the slogan: &quot;If you want to vote Conservative, don&#x27;t fall ill&quot;.
Under British election regulations, such broadcasts are rationed by formula among main parties, and terrestrial broadcasters are obliged to run them on set days, in peak time schedules. Each broadcast therefore has more impact on political debate than in unregulated systems.

The story of the broadcast was described by one press officer – Julie Hall, Neil Kinnock&#x27;s press secretary, as based on an actual case. In fact while a particular case had been the starting point of the creative team that had produced the broadcast – working from a letter by the girl&#x27;s parent to Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary, they denied it was meant to be a recounting of her case.

Conflicting accounts of the details of the case quickly surfaced, with the supposed inspiration for the ad being then-five-year old Jennifer Bennett. Allegedly, the grandfather of the girl in question was a Conservative MP who informed the party of Labour&#x27;s plans, allowing it to prepare an investigative response ahead of time. The mass circulation tabloid, &quot;The Sun&quot;, ran the story: &quot;If Kinnock will tell lies about a sick little girl, will he ever tell the truth about anything?&quot;. This was one of several anti-Kinnock headlines that the tabloid ran in the run-up to the 1992 general election, and it has often been said that The Sun&#x27;s unshakeable support for the Tories and opposition to Labour helped win the election for the Tories. The story though was broken by Peter Hitchens, then of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

==Aftermath==
In subsequent press discussion, Labour&#x27;s point about healthcare was overshadowed by debate about the ethics of involving a young girl in national politics, and over which side made her identity public. The view inside the Labour Party was, however, that the huge volume of coverage the story generated in the UK&#x27;s local and regional media did the party tremendous good. However, as told by Philip Gould the controversy made the party back off the issue of health at a national level.

The Conservative Party went on to win the 1992 election with a narrow majority of 21 seats. Labour leader Neil Kinnock resigned three days afterwards. Jennifer&#x27;s father, John Bennett, went on to become a critic of the health provision achieved by Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour government.

==Other &#x27;health war&#x27; controversies==
The War of Jennifer&#x27;s Ear now serves as the type specimen in British political discussions, for political rhetoric that leans on specific cases, as opposed to broad statistics, particularly in the context of debates over healthcare. Such foundations are acknowledged to be hazardous for politicians to employ in any decisive argument. The tactic has nonetheless been repeated on several occasions, at each of which headline writers attempt to formulate a new version of the &#x27;war of&#x27; label:
* Mavis Skeet (2000) – A cancer patient died in Leeds after four times having surgery postponed by a lack of available intensive care beds. The scandal was raised by a newspaper, and resulted in significant government reviews.
* Rose Addis (2002) – Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith criticised the government&#x27;s record by illustrating the case of a 94-year-old woman who he claimed had been neglected in a hospital. The hospital&#x27;s Medical Director, Dr Malone-Lee pointed out that she had been seen, but that she had &quot;a particular reservation about some of the nurses&quot; and refused to let them attend to her. This was interpreted as a suggestion that Addis&#x27; objections had been racially based, which the hospital later made clear was not the case.
* Anonymous (2004) – Conservative leader Michael Howard complained that a Folkestone constituent of his was told to wait 20 months for vital radiotherapy. The issue cooled off after he discovered that a clerical error had occurred – the wait was in fact scheduled to be 20 weeks.
* Margaret Dixon (2005) – Conservative leader Michael Howard attempted to show, in the run-up to the 2005 general election, that the incumbent Labour Party was failing the NHS. Dixon, from Warrington, was cited to illustrate the increase in cancelled operations, a statistic that was dismissed as the consequence of increases in overall operations performed.
* &quot;Jack&quot; (2019) - Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson refused to look at a photograph of a boy who allegedly had to sleep on the floor whilst waiting to be seen at a Leeds hospital. An ITV news reporter attempted to show Johnson the picture on his phone, but he refused to look, before taking the device and putting it in his pocket. The boy was being assessed for suspected pneumonia.

<doc id="650934" wikidata="Q7242730" url="?curid=650934" title="Pride-and-ego down">
<text>Pride-and-ego down is a US Army term for techniques used by captors in interrogating prisoners to encourage cooperation, usually consisting of &quot;attacking the source&#x27;s sense of personal worth&quot; and in an &quot;attempt to redeem his pride, the source will usually involuntarily provide pertinent information in attempting to vindicate himself.&quot;

Official documents state that such techniques should not go &quot;beyond the limits that would apply to an EPW [enemy prisoner of war].&quot;

==US Army definition from FM 2-22.3==

8-45. (Interrogation) The emotional-pride and ego-down approach is based on attacking the source&#x27;s ego or self-image. The source, in defending his ego, reveals information to justify or rationalize his actions. This information may be valuable in answering collection requirements or may give the [human intelligence] HUMINT collector insight into the viability of other approaches. This approach is effective with sources who have displayed weakness or feelings of inferiority. A real or imaginary deficiency voiced about the source, loyalty to his organization, or any other feature can provide a basis for this technique.

8-46. The HUMINT collector accuses the source of weakness or implies he is unable to do a certain thing. This type of source is also prone to excuses and rationalizations, often shifting the blame to others. An example of this technique is opening the collection effort with the question, &quot;Why did you surrender so easily when you could have escaped by crossing the nearby ford in the river?&quot; The source is likely to provide a basis for further questions or to reveal significant information if he attempts to explain his surrender in order to vindicate himself. He may give an answer such as, &quot;No one could cross the ford because it is mined.&quot;

8-47. The objective is for the HUMINT collector to use the source&#x27;s sense of pride by attacking his loyalty, intelligence, abilities, leadership qualities, slovenly appearance, or any other perceived weakness. This will usually goad the source into becoming defensive, and he will try to convince the HUMINT collector he is wrong. In his attempt to redeem his pride and explain his actions, the source may provide pertinent information. Possible targets for the emotional-pride and ego-down approach are the source&#x27;s—

* Loyalty.
* Technical competence.
* Leadership abilities.
* Soldierly qualities.
* Appearance.

8-48. There is a risk associated with this approach. If the emotional-pride and ego-down approach fails, it is difficult for the HUMINT collector to recover and move to another approach without losing his credibility. Also, there is potential for application of the pride and ego approach to cross the line into humiliating and degrading treatment of the detainee. Supervisors should consider the experience level of their subordinates and determine specifically how the interrogator intends to apply the approach technique before approving the interrogation plan.

<text>Garwolin is a town on the Wilga river in eastern Poland, capital of Garwolin County, situated in the southeast part of the Garwolin plateau in Masovian Voivodeship, 62 km southeast of Warsaw, 100 km northwest of Lublin. As of December 2021, the town has 17,566 inhabitants.

==History==

The name of the town occurs in the medieval notes in 1386 and 1404. Name Garwolin comes from a Garwoł, which is a name. However, there is a popular legend connecting the town&#x27;s name with rooks (Polish: &quot;gawrony&quot;).

Traces of settlement on terrains of present days boundaries of Garwolin are more than 2000 years old. It is believed that Garwolin received its city charter in 1423, but the exact date is unknown; it is almost certain that the document from 1423 was only acknowledgement of before-stated city laws. In time of the Deluge casualties exceeded 90%.

During the Polish–Soviet War, the town was captured and briefly occupied by the invading Russians, before it was recaptured by the Poles led by Gen. Konarzewski on August 16, 1920. Polish Marshal Józef Piłsudski stayed in the town the next day.

During World War II and the Nazi occupation of Poland, about 70% of the city was destroyed. The town and the powiat were administered by Kreishauptmann Karl Freudenthal, who was responsible for the murder of more than 1000 inhabitants, the deportation of several thousand local Poles to concentration camps and slave labor in Nazi Germany, and the transfer of the local Jews to various ghettos in the region. For his war crimes, Freudenthal was sentenced to death by the Polish underground, and the sentence was carried out by the Home Army on 5 July 1944, as part of Operacja Główki (&quot;Operation Heads&quot;).

Two Poles from Garwolin were also murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in 1940, and six died in Soviet Gulag camps between 1939 and 1947.

At the end of July 1944 the Red Army&#x27;s 2nd Guards Tank Army, under the command of Alexei Radzievsky, routed the German 73rd Infantry Division at Garwolin, capturing its commander, Friedrich Franek.

After the war Garwolin was restored to Poland and enlarged. From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Siedlce Voivodeship. The Neo-Baroque church, dating from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, is a notable building.

In the year 2022 the school managed to take 256th place in a national ranking of secondary schools.
* The Cyprian Norwid Catholic secondary school - founded in 1996 by Andrzej Banasiuk, it is the only Catholic school in the town of Garwolin.

<text>5000 Volts is the name of a British disco recording act that achieved success throughout Europe during the 1970s. The group consisted of vocalists Tina Charles and Martin Jay, with a changing group of session musicians.

==Career==
They released several singles in the mid-1970s, but did not achieve success until radio stations began playing the B-side to their 1975 single, &quot;Bye Love&quot;. The song, &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, was released in its own right and became a major hit throughout Europe, peaking at number 4 on the UK Singles Chart;
and at number 1 on the German Top100 Singles chart and the Swedish chart and also number 10 in South Africa. It was also a major top 10 hit in Australia and charted in the United States where it reached number 26, competing against Jim Gilstrap&#x27;s version of the song, which hit number 78.

Although Tina Charles provided the vocals, she was not publicly acknowledged as the group&#x27;s singer and for the band&#x27;s 1975 appearance on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; they were fronted by singer/actress Luan Peters.

In 1975, the group was expanded by record producer Tony Eyers into a permanent five piece, with the inclusion of Martin Cohen (bass and vocals), Kevin Wells (drums) and Mike Nelson (keyboards). Subsequent singles failed to attract widespread interest in the UK, although the group became popular in South Africa and Germany. Charles left the group after a dispute with the record label and continued with her solo career. She was replaced by Linda Kelly.

The next single &quot;Doctor Kiss Kiss&quot; reached number 8 in the United Kingdom, and number 6 in South Africa, but the band struggled to maintain public interest. The group disbanded in 1978.

Martin Jay launched a solo career without success, before returning to his earlier role as a session musician, working for bands such as Enigma, Tight Fit in 1981 and the UK Mixmasters in 1990.

In 2012, Tina Charles and Martin Jay reunited to re-record some of their hits. The album &quot;Reunited&quot; was the result of their reunion.

<text>Global Frequency is an American comic book science fiction limited series created and written by Warren Ellis and published by Wildstorm Productions, an imprint of DC Comics.

The series is set in the present day, consisting of single-issue, standalone stories. The 12 issues were published between October 2002 and June 2004. Each issue was drawn by a different artist, with uniform covers by Brian Wood, and interior artwork colored by David Baron.

==Overview==
The Global Frequency is an independent, covert intelligence organization headed by a former intelligence agent who uses the alias of Miranda Zero. Reportedly, 1,001 people are on the Global Frequency, forming an active smart mob communicating by specially modified video mobile phones through a central dispatch system coordinated by a young woman code-named Aleph.

The purpose of the organization is to protect and rescue the world from the consequences of the various secret projects that the governments or individuals of the world have established, which are unknown to the public at large. The people on the Global Frequency are chosen and called on for their specialized skills in a variety of areas, and include military personnel, intelligence agents, police detectives, scientific researchers, academics, athletes, former criminals and assassins. The threats addressed by the organization are equally varied and usually world-threatening, including rogue military operations, paranormal phenomena, terrorist attacks and religious cults. 

The existence of the organization is an open secret, but its membership list is anonymous, the identities of its field agents unknown to even each other before they meet on a mission. Often, the only way to tell a member of the Global Frequency is by the phones that they carry or the Global Frequency symbol—a circle with four points on its perimeter 90°s apart that they sport somewhere on their person. 

Who exactly funds the Global Frequency is not known. Zero has said that at least some of the money comes from the G8 governments that pay the Frequency for not revealing the various secret horrors that they combat. Although the presence of an independent, unaccountable agency with strike capability makes some authorities nervous, they also recognize the fact that the Frequency has the skills, the reach, and more importantly, the will to act where governments cannot. As a result, the organization gets tacit approval for its activities, and is sometimes called on by governments to deal with extraordinary crises. Mostly, the organization acts proactively as it discovers such threats.

Ellis designed the comic series like a television series with standalone &quot;episodes&quot;, allowing the reader to begin with any issue and be able to understand what was going on. As a result, the only regular characters in the series are Miranda Zero and Aleph, with only a few other characters making a reappearance in the 12th issue of the series. This also heightened the suspense for the reader, as the survival of these characters was not guaranteed.

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into two trade paperbacks. After the WildStorm imprint was discontinued, the entire series was collected under the Vertigo label in 2013, with a Deluxe Edition under the DC Comics label in 2018. 

* &quot;Global Frequency Volume 1: Planet Ablaze&quot; (collects &quot;Global Frequency&quot; #1–6, )
* &quot;Global Frequency Volume 2: Detonation Radio&quot; (collects &quot;Global Frequency&quot; #7–12, )
* &quot;Global Frequency&quot; (collects &quot;Global Frequency&quot; #1–12, )
* &quot;Global Frequency, The Deluxe Edition&quot; (collects &quot;Global Frequency&quot; #1–12, )

==Awards==
The series was nominated for &quot;Best Limited Series&quot; in the 2004 edition of the Eisner Award.

==In other media==

Mark Burnett prepared a &quot;Global Frequency&quot; television series for 2005 with Michelle Forbes as Miranda Zero, Josh Hopkins as Sean Flynn, Jenni Baird as Dr. Katrina Finch and Aimee Garcia as Aleph. The characters of Sean Flynn, an ex-policeman who accidentally stumbled on a Global Frequency mission, and Katrina Finch, a brilliant scientist with expertise in multiple fields, were created especially for the series. 

Unlike the comic book, which had an ever-changing cast of field agents, Flynn and Finch were to be regulars along with Zero and Aleph, with other Frequency members coming in as and when necessary in supporting roles. This would allow for the character continuity expected of a television series and yet allow other characters to be killed off as in the comic book.

A pilot episode, based heavily on the first issue of the comic book, was produced, but The WB (the original intended network) did not commission the series. John Rogers was the principal creative force behind the television incarnation, writing the pilot episode, with Ellis credited as producer and creator. Other writers waiting to come on board included David Slack, Ben Edlund and Diego Gutierrez. The pilot was directed by Nelson McCormick.

The unaired pilot was leaked onto the Internet in June 2005. Although it received positive reactions from those who watched it, Ellis said that the leak annoyed Warner Brothers to the extent that they killed the project.

In November 2009, &quot;Production Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Twitter feed revealed that a new television adaptation of &quot;Global Frequency&quot; was being worked on by The CW Television Network and writer Scott Nimerfro, while a new pilot by Jerry Bruckheimer and written by Rockne S. O&#x27;Bannon was reportedly being produced by Fox in November 2014, but by February 2015, Fox did not order the pilot due to problems with the script.

<doc id="650963" wikidata="Q6942172" url="?curid=650963" title="Music of Manitoba">
<text>[[Manitoba]] has produced much Canadian music, especially since the early 1960s.

The University of Manitoba and Brandon University both include schools of music. Brandon University&#x27;s music school and its Queen Elizabeth II Music Building are hubs for music in southwestern Manitoba.

==Traditional music==
Manitoba is a center for the old-time fiddling of the Métis people. The tune &quot;Whiskey Before Breakfast&quot; was popularized there by the Métis fiddler Andy DeJarlis (1914–1975), who was from the Red River region.

Bob Nolan was a cowboy singer famous for writing &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot;, while Winnipeg-born Oscar Brand was an important figure in folk music.

In the early 1990s Susan Aglukark, born in Churchill, achieved national country music and adult contemporary chart success with songs incorporating Inuit folk music traditions.

==Popular music==

===1960s – mid-1970s===

The Canadian 1960s supergroup &quot;Chad Allen and the Expressions&quot; (later known as The Guess Who) became the first rock musicians to be recognized outside Canada. Their 1965 hit &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot; gave them instant success in Canada and Great Britain. The band was renamed the Guess Who in 1966, and with Chad Allen gone and new keyboardist Burton Cummings on vocals, they began to realize their full potential as a rock band. Their hits &quot;American Woman&quot;, &quot;No Time&quot;, &quot;Clap for the Wolfman&quot;, &quot;These Eyes&quot;, and &quot;No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature&quot; made them one of the most successful rock bands to ever come from Canada. A version of the band featuring original dummer Garry Peterson continues to perform as the Guess Who, but the band as most fans know it broke up in 1975.

Neil Young was also a product of the 1960s Winnipeg music scene, and has deep family roots in Western Manitoba. Neil played in community clubs in Winnipeg with his band, the Squires, during the mid-1960s. Those days were recounted in the song &quot;Prairie Town&quot;, recorded in 1992 with Randy Bachman. Early in Neil&#x27;s career he played with Stephen Stills in the band Buffalo Springfield, and again with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. However, Neil Young is best known as a solo artist, producing albums like &quot;Harvest&quot; and a string of hits. As of 2022, his career has spanned more than five decades. He is referred to by some as the Godfather of Grunge, having inspired grunge pioneers like Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain and Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder. Some regard him as one of the most influential Canadian musicians of all time.

Former Guess Who guitarist, Randy Bachman, started a band called Brave Belt not long after he left the Guess Who. Brave Belt was later renamed to Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO for short). Bachman–Turner Overdrive became popular with such hits as &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;, the Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothin&#x27; Yet&quot; from 1974, and &quot;Let it Ride&quot;. Burton Cummings, who had been the lead singer of the Guess Who, also had a successful solo career with softer hits including &quot;Stand Tall&quot;, &quot;Scared&quot;, and &quot;Break it to Them Gently&quot;. In spite of the breakup of the Guess Who, several of Cummings’ solo songs featured Bachman on guitar. Bachman and Cummings continue to perform together on occasion under the banner Bachman-Cummings.

Between 1970 and 1974, four different Winnipeg artists had #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including the aforementioned The Guess Who, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Neil Young, and Terry Jacks with 1974&#x27;s &quot;Seasons in the Sun.&quot;

===Mid 1970s – mid-1990s===

Tom Cochrane, a rocker originally from the town of Lynn Lake in Northern Manitoba, rose to fame with his band Red Rider, producing such hits as &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot;, &quot;Boy Inside the Man&quot; and &quot;Big League&quot;. As a solo artist Cochrane recorded five albums, producing the hit &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot;, a song later covered by country band Rascal Flatts, among others.

The late 1970s and early-to-mid 1980s brought a new arena rock vibe to the local music scene, featuring made-in-Manitoba rockers Harlequin, and the Chris Burke-Gaffney-lead bands The Pumps, Orphan and later the Deadbeat Honeymooners. Harlequin was arguably the most popular band to come out of Manitoba in the early 1980s, producing several radio-friendly hits including &quot;Sweet Things in Life&quot;, &quot;Innocence&quot;, and &quot;Superstitious Feeling&quot;. Winnipeg was also a second home and regular stop for Regina-based Streetheart — a band with several linkages to Winnipeg including original member Ken “Spider” Sinnaeve.

In the late 1980s, an indie folk/pop band from Winnipeg called Crash Test Dummies was formed featuring singers Brad Roberts and Ellen Reid. In 1991, Crash Test Dummies had success in Canada with their first album &quot;The Ghosts that Haunt Me,&quot; which included the single “Superman&#x27;s Song”. They found mainstream success in the US, UK and Australia with their second album, featuring the folk rock Billboard Modern Rock Tracks #1 single in 1994 &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot;, as well as their third album and the single &quot;The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead&quot; which was featured in the movie &quot;Dumb &amp; Dumber&quot;.

The Watchmen formed in Winnipeg in 1988, releasing their first album, &quot;McLaren Furnace Room&quot; in 1992. It was named for the space in Winnipeg&#x27;s McLaren Hotel, where the band would rehearse. The Watchmen released seven albums and are known for Daniel Greaves’ unique vocals and songs like &quot;Boneyard Tree&quot;, &quot;Incarnate&quot; and &quot;Stereo&quot;, among others.

Originally formed in Seattle, Econoline Crush is a band based in Vancouver, led by singer Trevor Hurst, who was born and raised in Virden, Manitoba. Econoline Crush had several hit songs in Canada, including &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What It&#x27;s Like&quot;, &quot;Sparkle and Shine&quot;, and &quot;All That You Are&quot;.

The New Meanies, originally called the Blue Meanies, are a Canadian four piece rock band from Winnipeg. Formed around 1990 by high school friends Damon Mitchell (lead vocals, guitar, harmonica), Jeff Hondubura (guitar, vocals), Sky Onosson (bass, vocals, keyboards) and Jason Kane (drums, percussion) started playing blues-influenced rock. After releasing two independent albums, &quot;Experience is Lost&quot; (independently released on cassette only) and &quot;The Blue Meanies&quot;, they toured extensively throughout Western Canada in the early 1990s. The band signed with Virgin Records in 1996. The band changed its name to the New Meanies due to the existence of another Blue Meanies based in Chicago, and recorded a new album &quot;Three Seeds&quot; in the Los Angeles area with producer Howard Benson. The album was released in 1998, and the single &quot;Letting Time Pass&quot; achieved airplay on radio and television, charting at No. 14 on RPM Magazine&#x27;s Canadian rock/alternative chart. In 1999, the band performed in Toronto with Danko Jones and Tricky Woo. In 2000, the band went indie again and released a new album, &quot;Highways&quot;, in 2001.

===Recent rock and pop music===

Born in India, and currently living in Vancouver, Bif Naked spent her teen and young adult years in Winnipeg where she developed into the unique artist that she is today. The heavily tattooed Naked has earned a loyal following with her unique and personal brand of rock music and poetry. Several of her songs have received airplay over the years, including “Spaceman”, “I Love Myself Today”, and “Tango Shoes”. Bif Naked continued recording while she battled breast cancer, releasing her album &quot;The Promise&quot; in 2009.

Juno Award-winning artist Chantal Kreviazuk released her first album in 1997 and recorded several hits, but is perhaps most successful as a songwriter. Kreviazuk has co-written songs for and with many other artists including Avril Lavigne, Gwen Stefani, Kelly Clarkson, and her husband Raine Maida of Our Lady Peace fame.

Brent Fitz a multi-instrumentalist born in Winnipeg, currently resides in Las Vegas and has recorded and toured with a vast array of Canadian and International artists including Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash, Alice Cooper, Mötley Crüe vocalist Vince Neil, Theory Of A Deadman, Streetheart, Harlequin and The Guess Who.

Hard Rock band Jet Set Satellite secured a record deal and burst on to the Canadian music scene in 2000 with two hits: &quot;Best Way to Die&quot; and &quot;Baby, Cool Your Jets&quot;. They left their label after only one album but continue to record as an indie band. Also in 2000, dance-pop duo McMaster &amp; James made the leap from playing gigs at the Bank Cabaret in downtown Winnipeg to pop music fame with their one and only self-titled album.

Remy Shand also enjoyed a successful music career. His 2002 debut album, &quot;The Way I Feel&quot;, earned him a Juno Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul Recording, and four Grammy nominations. In the spring of 2013, Shand released a cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Where Are We Going?&quot; to YouTube, and added &quot;Springtime&quot; to his Bandcamp site. The song is dedicated to his late mother.

Propagandhi is a punk rock band from Winnipeg (originally from Portage la Prairie, Manitoba) that incorporates politics and ethics in its music and performances. Though not heavily played on the radio, the band parlayed a renewed interest in punk music in the late 1990s into a successful touring career, and won the 2006 ECHO songwriting award for their song &quot;A Speculative Fiction&quot;.

Juno-nominated indie-rockers The Weakerthans formed in 1997. Critical recognition soon followed, as did a local fan base, although they are best known to many for their tongue-in-cheek salute to their home town “One Great City!”, which features the line “I hate Winnipeg”.

Other Manitoba artists and bands in the rock and pop genres include The Waking Eyes, Royal Canoe, Imaginary Cities, and Chic Gamine.

==Other genres==
Manitoba also has made significant contributions in other areas of music besides pop. There is a choral tradition that goes back to the beginnings of the 20th century. Manitoba has an opera tradition, a vaudeville tradition and a classical music tradition as well. Manitoba&#x27;s multi-cultural make up is influenced by the cultures of the world.

The late jazz legend Lenny Breau, also a Winnipegger, had a profound impact on the music of Randy Bachman. He is a world-renowned jazz guitarist known for his rapid finger picking style and ability to sound like three guitars at once. Jazz guitarist Ed Bickert was also born in Manitoba.

The country band Doc Walker is also popular in Manitoba&#x27;s country music scene, as well as Canada&#x27;s country music scene. Formed in Portage la Prairie in 1996, the band has gone on to produce an expansive discography which features numerous singles and albums. Popular songs by Doc Walker include Do It Right, Rocket Girl, and Beautiful Life. As of 2022, country musician William Prince has been popular as well.

Additionally, electronic musician Aaron Funk, also known as Venetian Snares, is from and based out of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Venetian Snares has been creating computer-based electronic music since the middle of the 1990s and is a pioneer of the breakcore genre. In 2016, he released an album entirely made with modular analog synths. He released a collaborative album with celebrated Canadian producer/musician Daniel Lanois in 2018.

<doc id="650965" wikidata="Q7880904" url="?curid=650965" title="Ulysses (American band)">
<text>Ulysses is an American indie rock band formed by Robert Schneider (lead vocalist of The Apples in Stereo) along with John Ferguson and Ben Fulton in early 2003. Robert Beatty (of Hair Police) joined later that year. They released their first album, &quot;010&quot;, on October 26, 2004, through Eenie Meenie Records. The album was released in mono.

==Band history==
While touring Spain with The Apples in Stereo, Schneider was inspired to write &quot;Push You Away&quot;, the first song written for &quot;010&quot;. Schneider began writing other songs for the album as well.

Schneider&#x27;s main influences for the band&#x27;s songs were The Velvet Underground and My Bloody Valentine.

In Lexington, Kentucky, the band formed by impulse when Schneider invited Ferguson and Fulton to organize songs for Schneider&#x27;s other side project, Marbles. Schneider asked them to first play his set of 10 songs, and Ulysses was born. The band recorded the album &quot;010&quot; live in Schneider&#x27;s garage studio, in mono with the drums and amplifiers situated symmetrically around a single microphone. The album was released on Eenie Meenie Records.

In the process of writing and recording &quot;010&quot;, Schneider&#x27;s marriage with Apples in Stereo bandmate Hilarie Sidney ended.

<doc id="650967" wikidata="Q1569852" url="?curid=650967" title="Centaurea scabiosa">
<text>Centaurea scabiosa, or greater knapweed, is a perennial plant of the genus &quot;Centaurea&quot;. It is native to Europe and bears purple flower heads.

Greater knapweed is found growing in dry grasslands, hedgerows and cliffs on lime-rich soil. Upright branched stems terminate in single thistle-like flowerheads, each having an outer ring of extended, purple-pink &quot;ragged&quot; bracts which form a crown around the central flowers. The plant has deeply dissected leaves which form a clump at the base.

This species is very valuable to bees. It is also a magnet for many species of butterfly. Among them is the marbled white.

This is the only known food plant for caterpillars of the Coleophoridae case-bearer moth &quot;Coleophora didymella&quot;. &quot;Centaurea scabiosa&quot; has been used in traditional herbal healing as either a vulnerary or an emollient.

The plant is sometimes confused with devils-bit scabious, however the leaves on this plant are arranged alternately, whereas in devils-bit they are opposite.

==Description==
This perennial herb grows with an erect grooved stem up to 90 cm high. The leaves are alternate, pinnatifid and with stalks. The flower heads are 5 cm across and on long stalks. The florets are red-purple.

==Habitat==
Dry grassland, roadsides and calcareous substrate.

==Distribution==
Found in Great Britain and Ireland.

<text>ISTAR stands for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. In its macroscopic sense, ISTAR is a practice that links several battlefield functions together to assist a combat force in employing its sensors and managing the information they gather.

Information is collected on the battlefield through systematic observation by deployed soldiers and a variety of electronic sensors. &quot;Surveillance&quot;, &quot;target acquisition&quot; and &quot;reconnaissance&quot; are methods of obtaining this information. The information is then passed to intelligence personnel for analysis, and then to the commander and their staff for the formulation of battle plans. Intelligence is processed information that is relevant and contributes to an understanding of the ground, and of enemy dispositions and intents. Intelligence failures can happen.

== ISR (Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) ==
ISR is the coordinated and integrated acquisition, processing and provision of timely, accurate, relevant, coherent and assured information and intelligence to support commander&#x27;s conduct of activities. Land, sea, air and space platforms have critical ISR roles in supporting operations in general. By massing ISR assets, an improved clarity and depth of knowledge can be established. ISR encompasses multiple activities related to the planning and operation of systems that collect, process, and disseminate data in support of current and future military operations.

In July 2021 the NDAA budget markup by the House Armed Services Committee sought to retain ISR resources such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk, the E-8 Joint Surveillance Radar and Attack System (JSTARS) which the Air Force is seeking to divest. 
Examples of ISR systems include surveillance and reconnaissance systems ranging from satellites, to crewed aircraft such as the U-2, to uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) such as the US Air Force&#x27;s Global Hawk and Predator and the US Army&#x27;s Hunter and PSST Aerostats, to unmanned ocean-going vessels, to other ground-, air-, sea-, or space-based equipment, to human intelligence teams, or to AI-based ISR systems. 

The intelligence data provided by these ISR systems can take many forms, including optical, radar, or infrared images or electronic signals. Effective ISR data can provide early warning of enemy threats as well as enable military forces to increase effectiveness, coordination, and lethality, and demand for ISR capabilities to support ongoing military operations has increased. In December 2021, the US Navy began testing the usefulness and effectiveness of unmanned &quot;saildrones&quot; at recognizing targets of interest on the high seas.

For space-based targeting sensors, in a 2019 Broad Agency Announcement, the US government defined ISR in this case as &quot;a capability for gathering data and information on an object or in an area of interest (AOI) on a persistent, event-driven, or scheduled basis using imagery, signals, and other collection methods. This includes warning (to include ballistic missile activity), targeting analysis, threat capability assessment, situational awareness, battle damage assessment (BDA), and characterization of the operational environment.&quot; &quot;Persistence&quot; was described: &quot;Persistent access provides predictable coverage of an area of interest (AOI). Most space-based intelligence collection capabilities consist of multiple satellites operating in concert, or supplemented by other sensors, when continuous surveillance of an area is desired. Persistent sensors must provide sufficient surveillance revisit timelines to support a weapon strike at any time.&quot;
The United States Space Force, National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) share the satellite-based ISR task as of 2021. &quot;See Space Delta 7&quot;

From 2018, the NGA has used Data transformation services (DTS), to convert raw sensor data into a format usable by its mission partners, who are government agencies whose names are classified. In light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the NGA has taken operational control of DoD&#x27;s Project Maven, the AI ISR project for area defense, to identify point targets for ISR. 

The NGA uses OREN, the Odyssey GEOINT Edge Node for National System for Geospatial Intelligence, or NGS. The Joint Regional Edge Node (JREN) is on-deck for distributing nearly a petabyte to the Combatant Commands in the next year, for 2023, an increase by a factor of 10.

NRO &quot;has a proven track record in [ISR]&quot;, insists one of the founders of the US Space Force, who defends the capability of the NRO over the ambition of the Space Force to take over the role of ISR. GMTI (ground moving target indicator) data is an objective for Space Force, NGA, and NRO.
;ISR at platoon level
In July 2022, Junior (3rd year) and Senior (4th year) cadets at West Point had hands-on experience building and using drones with various tactical capabilities, guided by faculty from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science departments in tactical applications during Cadet Leadership Development Training .
Ukraine&#x27;s soldiers are using FPV drones on the battlefield, armed with munitions. 

ISR concepts are also associated with certain intelligence units, for instance Task Force ODIN, ISR TF (Company+) in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan.

== ISTAR==
ISTAR is the process of integrating the intelligence process with surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance tasks in order to improve a commander&#x27;s situational awareness and consequently their decision making. The inclusion of the &quot;I&quot; is important as it recognizes the importance of taking the information from all the sensors and processing it into useful knowledge.

ISTAR can also refer to:

* a unit or sub unit with ISTAR as a task (e.g.: an ISTAR squadron)
* equipment required to support the task

==Variations of ISTAR==
There are several variations on the &quot;ISTAR&quot; acronym. Some variations reflect specific emphasis on certain aspects of ISTAR.

===Surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (STAR)===
A term used when emphasis is to be placed on the sensing component of ISTAR.

===Reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA)===

RSTA is used by the US Army in place of STAR or ISTAR. Also, a term used to identify certain US Army units: for instance, 3rd Squadron, 153rd RSTA. These units serve a similar role to the below mentioned US Marine Corps STA platoons, but on a larger scale.

===Surveillance and target acquisition (STA) ===

Used to designate one of the following:
*A US Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) - specifically a STA United States Marine Corps Scout Sniper
*The role of a unit (e.g. STA patrol) or equipment 
*A doctrine similar to ISTAR; for the US, and its allies and partners, its basis is the US National Defense Space Architecture (NDSA) as realized by layered constellations of Earth satellites and Earth stations

<text>In mathematical optimization, the ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) method is an iterative method that is used in computed tomography.

In applications in medical imaging, the OSEM method is used for positron emission tomography (PET), for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and for X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) scans.

The OSEM method is related to the expectation–maximization (EM) method of statistics. The OSEM method is also related to methods of filtered back projection.

<text>Agulhas Negras Peak (, , ) is the fifth-highest mountain in Brazil, standing at above sea level, making it one of the highest in the Brazilian Highlands. It is located in Itatiaia National Park, in the Mantiqueira range, on the border of the states of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. It is the highest point in the state of Rio de Janeiro, the third-highest in Minas Gerais, and the second-highest in the Mantiqueira range.

The climb to the top of the mountain was first attempted by Franklin Massena in the year 1856. Further attempts were made by André Rebouças in 1878 and by Horácio de Carvalho in 1898, but the summit was only reached by Carlos Spierling and Osvaldo Leal in 1919.

==Etymology==
Its name means Black Needles Peak, because of the sharp dark rocks on its top, which give it a distinctive shape. The peak&#x27;s massif is known as &quot;Itatiaia&quot;, which means &quot;stone with many sharp points&quot; in the Tupi language. The highest rock, with the summit, is known as &quot;Itatiaiaçu&quot;, or simply &quot;Açu&quot; (a Tupi suffix meaning &quot;big&quot;) among Brazilian mountaineers.

==Geography==
Agulhas Negras Peak can be seen to the northwest of Resende when driving between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro on the Via Dutra highway, but this is only possible at a few points on the road, because a lower mountain range closer to the road stands in the line-of-sight at most other nearby spots.

A mountain shelter called Abrigo Rebouças is located near the base of the peak, at an elevation of about . It is accessible by a gravel road (BR-485) from the BR-354 federal highway at the Garganta do Registro mountain pass, via Itatiaia National Park&#x27;s north entrance. The access road reaches an altitude of at the entrance of the park, and a short spur from it leading to a communications tower of the Eletrobras Furnas electricity company reaches ; these are the highest points one can reach in a regular car (as opposed to off-road vehicles) in Brazil.

==Elevation measurements==

For years, Agulhas Negras was thought to be the highest mountain in Brazil. The title later went to Pico da Bandeira, in the Caparaó range between the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo (now known to be at ). In 1965, it was found that Pico da Neblina, in the state of Amazonas, was, in fact, the highest, with a currently revised height of .

Even then, Agulhas Negras was still thought to be the highest point in the Mantiqueira range, until a 2001 GPS measurement (later confirmed by an official joint expedition of the Brazilian Army and the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics - IBGE) showed that nearby Pedra da Mina was that mountain range&#x27;s highest point at , about seven metres higher than Agulhas Negras. Pedra da Mina was higher even though Agulhas Negras was also found to be slightly higher than previously thought, at , rather than its previous official altitude of . Agulhas Negras remains the highest point in the state of Rio de Janeiro.

In 2015, IBGE completed a new and more accurate mapping of the Brazilian territory regarding the geoid, the irregular imaginary surface based on the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field that is the reference for altitude measurements. This led the institution to recalculate the altitude of the mountains measured in the earlier project, according to the new reference. The new data were published in February 2016. Agulhas Negras was then found to stand at , a difference of 61 cm or about two feet.

<text>Seth Ezekiel Cohen is a fictional character on the Fox television series &quot;The O.C.&quot;, portrayed by Adam Brody. Seth is one of the &quot;core four&quot; characters on &quot;The O.C.&quot; alongside Ryan Atwood, Marissa Cooper, and Summer Roberts. Seth&#x27;s friendship with Ryan, who eventually became his adoptive brother, formed a focal point of the series along with their romances. Seth married Summer in the series finale. His other relationships were with Anna Stern and Alex Kelly. Seth&#x27;s goal was to attend Brown University, but he ends up going to Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and continuing work on his comic book &quot;Atomic County&quot;. The role saw Brody win four Teen Choice Awards from five nominations, from 2004 to 2006.

==Character development==

===Casting and creation===
Brody did not immediately get the part of Seth Cohen after his first audition because he improvised the dialogue. However, the producers called him back a month later for another test, and he was cast in March 2003. Schwartz said about Brody that he is &quot;naturally talented, a funny guy, and has a Point of View on the world (and an initial perspective on Seth) that made him feel very specific, and had a little attitude.&quot; The character is based on Schwartz, who said: &quot;The dynamic between Sandy and Seth is very much based on me and my dad. It was as much Seth&#x27;s choice not to fit in, as it was the Water Polo players rejecting him, and a lot of that came from Brody, as well as a love for Death Cab for Cutie.

===Characterization===

Carina Chocano of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described Seth as &quot;a nuanced portrait of a true-to-life dork [whose] relationship to Ryan is full of nice little ironies.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized him as &quot;eccentric and literate&quot; while the show&#x27;s website compared him to Holden Caulfield for being an existential hero. He has also been described as &quot;gawky&quot;.

Seth is very sarcastic and uses irony to find the humor in the events that occur around him. He has a positive nature, and although sometimes his humor is misconceived as ill-mannered, he tries to joke his way out of sticky situations and is more likely to laugh off the negatives and be overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the positives in his, and everyone else&#x27;s, life. He is shown throughout the series to be self-obsessed and neurotic, with a tendency to make himself the center of attention. However, in many episodes, he proves to be a sweet and genuine guy with good intentions and a good heart, and this is often overlooked by others. Seth is a very bubbly character, thanks to the likes of his &quot;only true friend&quot; Ryan, and is prone to not knowing when to keep his mouth shut, however this is more endearing and humorous, than irritating. He is a self-proclaimed geek and likes comic books, science fiction, video games, and old movies. He also has a toy horse named Captain Oats. Seth is close to both of his parents and often playfully teases them. Though he occasionally will not accept their help or advice, he does so sometimes and seems to value their opinions and knows they would do anything for him and vice versa. Seth is shown to care very much about his mother. His actions are demonstrated in episodes such as &quot;The Dearly Beloved&quot; when Seth hesitates to send his mother to rehab and in &quot;The Man of the Year&quot; when he takes care of her when she relapses in her drinking.

At school, Seth&#x27;s social awkwardness results in him being either ignored or bullied, making him a popular target for the jocks. Prior to Ryan&#x27;s arrival, he was routinely bullied by the jocks (namely, the water polo players), who would intentionally urinate on his shoes and slam him into the lockers, and had hated Newport so much that he wanted to go to a boarding school on the East Coast. If not bullied, he was largely ignored by his other peers; Summer treated him with disdain, calling him &quot;Death Breath Seth,&quot; while Marissa, who lived next door since they were in elementary school, did not speak to him until after Ryan&#x27;s arrival. He would go out on his sailboat, the Summer Breeze, to escape Newport; in Season 2 he admitted to Ryan that he sold it for cash while docked at Santa Barbara and caught a Greyhound to Portland. Besides his awkwardness, his naivety in social norms and relationships contributes to his propensity to draw trouble to himself and not realizing until it&#x27;s too late, a running gag in the show; for example, he has to be physically stopped by both Zach Stevens and Ryan when he tries to call his crush Alex Kelly even after she hinted for him to stay away because her ex is in town. He quickly forms a friendship with Ryan as the latter was the first person who befriended him without any preconceived notions and without judging him.

Seth was further designed as an artist in the second season. Plans of him drawing comics started at the end of the first season when executive producer Alan Heinberg impressed by Eric Wight&#x27;s work asked him to be the &quot;ghost artist&quot;. Wight, who said he easily related to Seth, first made sketches of the four main superheroes, and the rest came later as the episodes were being developed.

==Character arc==

===Season 1===
Seth Cohen was born in Berkeley, California, to parents Sanford &quot;Sandy&quot; Cohen and Kirsten Cohen. Raised in Newport Beach, he is Jewish on his father&#x27;s side and connects and identifies with his father&#x27;s religious and cultural background. However, he embraces the mutual holiday of Chrismukkah, a joint Christmas and Hanukkah holiday. He was befriended by Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) when the latter was brought home by Sandy. Before Ryan&#x27;s arrival, Seth was ignored by most of his peers due to his awkward nature and unusual hobbies. They quickly strike a friendship as Ryan did not judge him like other &quot;Newpsies&quot; and Seth was the first to accept Ryan as a member of the household without any reservations. Soon after Ryan&#x27;s arrival, Seth became friends with Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and got the chance to speak to Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson), a popular girl on whom he had a huge crush since childhood. The pair grew closer after they traveled to Tijuana together, despite Summer&#x27;s denial of liking him. She quickly turned him down for a date after seeing a few cheerleaders eyeing the pair. After finally admitting she liked Seth, Summer grew jealous of Seth&#x27;s friend Anna Stern (Samaire Armstrong), whom he met at a cotillion dance practice and he shared many interests with, including comics. They started dating after Seth decided in her favour during a contest for his affection between her and Summer. However, their relationship was short lived as they broke up when Seth made it obvious that he truly wanted Summer instead and had made the wrong choice. Anna soon left to go home to Pittsburgh, but she and Seth remained friends.
Though Summer and Seth started seeing each other and lost their virginity to each other, Summer still wanted their relationship to be secret. Seth refused to put up with this and declared his love for her atop a coffee cart in front of the school. Seth and Summer&#x27;s relationship became official and continued until Seth&#x27;s best and pretty much only friend Ryan Atwood announced he&#x27;d be returning to his home neighborhood, Chino, after his pregnant ex-girlfriend declared she wanted to keep the baby and raise it in her hometown. Seth tried to make Ryan stay and was distraught at his departure but tried to appear uninterested by it, although it pained him deeply. He couldn&#x27;t face the idea of becoming a loner once more, and even though he still had Summer, he decided to sail the oceans for the summer in his boat, Summer Breeze, which was named after Summer. He left a note for her, and for his parents, who were distraught over losing both Seth and Ryan in one day.

===Season 2 and 3===

Early in season 2, Seth is staying with Luke Ward in Portland, Oregon and working at a kayak rental shack. He refuses to come home despite his parents&#x27; calls as he was still resentful of his parents for letting Ryan go back to Chino, forcing Sandy to ask Ryan to accompany him to Portland in hopes of persuading Seth to return. Once Seth returned, Summer had moved on with Zach Stevens (Michael Cassidy). After accepting the fact that his relationship with Summer was over, Seth started dating Alex Kelly (Olivia Wilde), a girl with whom he temporarily worked at The Bait Shop in Newport Beach. He attempts to impress her by putting on a &quot;bad boy&quot; image, even entertaining the idea of wearing one of Ryan&#x27;s trademark wife-beaters to meet her and &quot;stealing&quot; his grandfather&#x27;s Aston Martin. Their relationship was short-lived after he accidentally discovers her making out with Marissa (Alex is revealed to be bisexual). In the meantime, Seth and Zach became friends as they both had a passion for comics. They created a comic book together titled &quot;Atomic County&quot; revolving around four Orange County teenagers who have super powers which mirror the &quot;core four&quot;. The tension came to a breaking point when Zach, Summer and Seth went on a trip to sell their comic book. Seth subtly admitted his feelings about Summer, who was about to leave on a trip to Italy with Zach a few weeks after, but Seth begged for her to be with him. She couldn&#x27;t deny her feelings and left Zach for Seth at the airport, sealing the new relationship with a rainy kiss in the style of Spider-Man. Zach ultimately gave Summer up at prom, and Seth swooped in to again tell the school how he loved Summer when she was named Prom Queen. Summer admits to Seth that she loves him for his &quot;little flaws and [his] little quirks&quot;. They stayed together and started to apply to colleges, deciding on Brown University, Seth&#x27;s dream college, because &quot;most importantly, it&#x27;s 3,000 miles away&quot;. Summer decided that if she got into Brown and Seth didn&#x27;t, she would not attend because she wanted to be with him. Summer got in and Seth did not, but he lied and told her he did because he didn&#x27;t want her to pass up Brown, which led to their breakup. When he visited Brown, Seth came across Anna and she helped him get an interview for the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). In the season finale, Seth surprised Summer with his acceptance to RISD for the spring semester, and they reunited. They happily graduated from high school, but things got difficult when Marissa died in a car accident.

===Season 4===
As the story continued six months later, Seth worked at a comic-book store and had problems with Summer, who turned from materialistic gossip into a tree-hugging Vegan (who later protested against poverty at a Thanksgiving meal at the Cohens) at college and would not answer his phone calls. He left long messages on her answering-machine. When they met in Newport, Summer acted cold towards him. After a visit from Taylor, Summer realized that she was isolating Seth because she couldn&#x27;t deal with what was in Newport - the memory of Marissa. She visited home for Thanksgiving, and Seth confronted her with this concept, which she eventually accepted, telling him via voice mail as she left to return to Brown to deal with it on her own. Though Summer came to terms with Marissa&#x27;s death through therapy and seemed to return to her old self, she and Seth quickly discovered that her tree-hugging ways had left a deep imprint. Seth supported her by stepping back and giving her space to pursue her new interests; however, this made Summer realize how important Seth was in her life and their relationship grew stronger. False pretenses led to Summer&#x27;s semester-long suspension from Brown just as Seth was to start at RISD, but Seth decided he would put off college until the following fall so they could return to Providence together. On the eve of the New Year, a pregnancy scare caused Seth to ask for Summer&#x27;s hand in marriage. Although the scare was false, plans for their marriage remained. Later, Summer backed out of the engagement, but they were still dating. Their relationship was again questioned when Summer was offered a job at GEORGE, while Seth had nothing set for him. When Newport was struck with an earthquake, they barely escape a collapsing streetlight and the Cohens, whose house was destroyed, cram together with Julie and Kaitlin Cooper at Summer&#x27;s house. For the next six months, Seth was in limbo and Summer challenges him to find something he is passionate about and pursue it. She accepted the offer from GEORGE but promises to stay in contact. The series concluded four years later in &quot;The End&#x27;s Not Near, It&#x27;s Here&quot; with the couple getting married in a Jewish ceremony, with Ryan serving as best man.

==Reception==
Upon the show&#x27;s premiere, Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC described Ryan and Seth&#x27;s friendship as &quot;the most promising plot&quot;.

At the start of the second season, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the relationship between the men is the show&#x27;s emotional centerpiece.&quot;

As of 2004, Seth was named one of the 10 best current characters by &quot;Zap2it&quot;, writing: &quot;The gangly Adam Brody effortlessly delivers his hilarious and sweetly sarcastic lines. He&#x27;s positively delightful and brings a level of humor not often seen on prime time soaps. Heck, even his wardrobe is a hoot.&quot;

In 2004, he was nominated for Choice Breakout Male TV Star and Choice TV Actor - Drama/Action Adventure, losing the former to Chad Michael Murray of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; and winning the latter.

In 2005, he won two awards for Choice TV Actor - Drama/Action Adventure and Choice TV Chemistry with Rachel Bilson who played Summer Roberts.

In 2006, he won again the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actor - Drama/Action Adventure.

In 2009, he was voted the &quot;Best Son&quot; in &quot;Zap2it&quot; first poll of the best television characters in the 2000s.

For his portrayal of Seth, Brody earned several Teen Choice Awards throughout the show&#x27;s run.

<doc id="650978" wikidata="Q2306768" url="?curid=650978" title="Pupillary light reflex">
<text>The pupillary light reflex (PLR) or photopupillary reflex is a reflex that controls the diameter of the pupil, in response to the intensity (luminance) of light that falls on the retinal ganglion cells of the retina in the back of the eye, thereby assisting in adaptation of vision to various levels of lightness/darkness. A greater intensity of light causes the pupil to constrict (miosis/myosis; thereby allowing less light in), whereas a lower intensity of light causes the pupil to dilate (mydriasis, expansion; thereby allowing more light in). Thus, the pupillary light reflex regulates the intensity of light entering the eye. Light shone into one eye will cause both pupils to constrict.

==Terminology==
The pupil is the dark circular opening in the center of the iris and is where light enters the eye. By analogy with a camera, the pupil is equivalent to aperture, whereas the iris is equivalent to the diaphragm. It may be helpful to consider the &quot;Pupillary reflex&quot; as an &quot;&#x27;Iris&#x27; reflex&quot;, as the iris sphincter and dilator muscles are what can be seen responding to ambient light. Whereas, the pupil is the passive opening formed by the active iris. Pupillary reflex is synonymous with pupillary response, which may be pupillary constriction or dilation. Pupillary reflex is conceptually linked to the side (left or right) of the reacting pupil, and not to the side from which light stimulation originates. Left pupillary reflex refers to the response of the left pupil to light, regardless of which eye is exposed to a light source. Right pupillary reflex means reaction of the right pupil, whether light is shone into the left eye, right eye, or both eyes. When light is shone into only one eye and not the other, it is normal for both pupils to constrict simultaneously. The terms &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;consensual&quot; refers to the side where the light source comes from, relative to the side of the reacting pupil. A direct pupillary reflex is pupillary response to light that enters the ipsilateral (same) eye. A consensual pupillary reflex is response of a pupil to light that enters the contralateral (opposite) eye. Thus there are four types of pupillary light reflexes, based on this terminology of absolute laterality (left versus right) and relative laterality (same side versus opposite side, ipsilateral versus contralateral, direct versus consensual):
# &quot;Left direct pupillary reflex&quot; is the left pupil&#x27;s response to light entering the left eye, the ipsilateral eye.
# &quot;Left consensual pupillary reflex&quot; is the left pupil&#x27;s indirect response to light entering the right eye, the contralateral eye.
# &quot;Right direct pupillary reflex&quot; is the right pupil&#x27;s response to light entering the right eye, the ipsilateral eye.
# &quot;Right consensual pupillary reflex&quot; is the right pupil&#x27;s indirect response to light entering the left eye, the contralateral eye.

==Neural pathway anatomy==
The pupillary light reflex neural pathway on each side has an afferent limb and two efferent limbs. The afferent limb has nerve fibers running within the optic nerve (CN II). Each efferent limb has parasympathetic nerve fibers traveling along the periphery of the oculomotor nerve (CN III). The afferent limb carries sensory input. Anatomically, the afferent limb consists of the retina, the optic nerve, and the pretectal nucleus in the midbrain, at level of superior colliculus. Ganglion cells of the retina project fibers through the optic nerve to the ipsilateral pretectal nucleus. The efferent limb is the pupillary motor output from the pretectal nucleus to the pupillary sphincter of the iris. The pretectal nucleus projects nerve fibers to the ipsilateral and contralateral Edinger-Westphal nuclei, which are also located in the midbrain. Each Edinger-Westphal nucleus gives rise to preganglionic parasympathetic fibers which exit with CN III and synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the ciliary ganglion. Postganglionic nerve fibers leave the ciliary ganglion to innervate the pupillary sphincter. Each afferent limb has two efferent limbs, one ipsilateral and one contralateral. The ipsilateral efferent limb transmits nerve signals for direct light reflex of the ipsilateral pupil. The contralateral efferent limb causes consensual light reflex of the contralateral pupil.

Sympathetic nervous system plays a role in dilating the pupils in low light conditions.

===Types of neurons===
The optic nerve, or more precisely, the photosensitive ganglion cells through the retinohypothalamic tract, is responsible for the afferent limb of the pupillary reflex; it senses the incoming light. The oculomotor nerve is responsible for the efferent limb of the pupillary reflex; it drives the iris muscles that constrict the pupil.
#Retina: The pupillary reflex pathway begins with the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, which convey information via the optic nerve, the most peripheral, distal, portion of which is the optic disc. Some axons of the optic nerve connect to the pretectal nucleus of the upper midbrain instead of the cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus (which project to the primary visual cortex). These &quot;intrinsic photosensitive ganglion cells&quot; are also referred to as &quot;melanopsin-containing&quot; cells, and they influence circadian rhythms as well as the pupillary light reflex.
#Pretectal nuclei: From the neuronal cell bodies in some of the pretectal nuclei, axons synapse on (connect to) neurons in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus. Those neurons are the preganglionic cells with axons that run in the oculomotor nerves to the ciliary ganglia.
#Edinger-Westphal nuclei: Parasympathetic neuronal axons in the oculomotor nerve synapse on ciliary ganglion neurons.
#Ciliary ganglia: Short post-ganglionic ciliary nerves leave the ciliary ganglion to innervate the Iris sphincter muscle of the iris.

===Schematic===
Referring to the neural pathway schematic diagram, the entire pupillary light reflex system can be visualized as having eight neural segments, numbered 1 through 8. Odd-numbered segments 1, 3, 5, and 7 are on the left. Even-numbered segments 2, 4, 6, and 8 are on the right. Segments 1 and 2 each includes both the retina and the optic nerve (cranial Nerve #2). Segments 3 and 4 are nerve fibers that cross from the pretectal nucleus on one side to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus on the contralateral side. Segments 5 and 6 are fibers that connect the pretectal nucleus on one side to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus on the same side. Segments 3, 4, 5, and 6 are all located within a compact region within the midbrain. Segments 7 and 8 each contains parasympathetic fibers that courses from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, through the ciliary ganglion, along the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve #3), to the ciliary sphincter, the muscular structure within the iris.

* Left direct light reflex involves neural segments 1, 5, and 7. Segment 1 is the afferent limb, which includes the retina and optic nerve. Segments 5 and 7 form the efferent limb.
* Left consensual light reflex involves neural segments 2, 4, and 7. Segment 2 is the afferent limb. Segments 4 and 7 form the efferent limb.
* Right direct light reflex involves neural segments 2, 6, and 8. Segment 2 is the afferent limb. Segments 6 and 8 form the efferent limb.
* Right consensual light reflex involves neural segments 1, 3, and 8. Segment 1 is the afferent limb. Segments 3 and 8 form the efferent limb.
The diagram may assist in localizing lesion within the pupillary reflex system by process of elimination, using light reflex testing results obtained by clinical examination.

==Clinical significance==

Pupillary light reflex provides a useful diagnostic tool for testing the integrity of the sensory and motor functions of the eye. Emergency physicians routinely test pupillary light reflex to assess brain stem function. Abnormal pupillary reflex can be found in optic nerve injury, oculomotor nerve damage, brain stem lesion (including brain stem death), and depressant drugs, such as barbiturates. Examples are provided as below:
*Optic nerve damage on the left (e.g. transection of left optic nerve, CN II, somewhere between retina and optic chiasma, therefore damaging the left afferent limb, leaving the rest of the pupillary light reflex neural pathway on both sides intact) will have the following clinical findings:
**The left direct reflex is lost. When the left eye is stimulated by light, neither pupils constrict. Afferent signals from the left eye cannot pass through the transected left optic nerve to reach the intact efferent limb on the left.
**The right consensual reflex is lost. When left eye is stimulated by light, afferent signals from the left eye cannot pass through the transected left optic nerve to reach the intact efferent limb on the right.
**The right direct reflex is intact. Direct light reflex of right pupil involves the right optic nerve and right oculomotor nerve, which are both intact.
**The left consensual reflex is intact. Consensual light reflex of left pupil involves the right optic nerve and left oculomotor nerve, which are both undamaged.
*Oculomotor nerve damage on the left (e.g. by nerve transection or inflammation/infection), or compression of parasympathetic fibers on the periphery of the left oculomotor nerve by a mass lesion (e.g. aneurysm, tumor, or brain herniation) will have the following clinical findings: 
**The left direct reflex is lost. When the left eye is stimulated by light, left pupil does not constrict, because the efferent signals cannot pass from midbrain, through left CN III, to the left pupillary sphincter.
**The right consensual reflex is intact. When the left eye is stimulated by light, the right pupil constricts, because the afferent limb on the left and the efferent limb on the right are both intact.
**The right direct reflex is intact. When light is shone into right eye, right pupil constricts. Direct reflex of the right pupil is unaffected, The right afferent limb, right CN II, and the right efferent limb, right CN III, are both intact.
**The left consensual reflex is lost. When the right eye is stimulated by light, left pupil does not constrict consensually. Right afferent limb is intact, but left efferent limb, left CN III, is damaged.

===Lesion localization example===
For example, in a person with abnormal left direct reflex and abnormal right consensual reflex (with normal left consensual and normal right direct reflexes), which would produce a left Marcus Gunn pupil, or what is called left afferent pupillary defect, by physical examination. Location of the lesion can be deduced as follows:
# Left consensual reflex is normal, therefore segments 2, 4, and 7 are normal. Lesion is not located in any of these segments.
# Right direct reflex is normal, therefore segments 2, 6, and 8 are normal. Combining with earlier normals, segments 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are all normal. 
# Remaining segments where lesion may be located are segments 1, 3, and 5. Possible combinations and permutations are: (a) segment 1 only, (b) segment 3 only, (c) segment 5 only, (d) combination of segments 1 and 3, (e) combination of segments 1 and 5, (f) combination of segments 3 and 5, and (g) combination of segments 1, 3, and 5. 
# Options (b) and (c) are eliminated because isolated lesion in segment 3 alone or in segment 5 alone cannot produce the light reflex abnormalities in question.
# A single lesion anywhere along segment 1, the left afferent limb, which includes the left retina, left optic nerve, and left pretectal nucleus, can produce the light reflex abnormalities observed. Examples of segment 1 pathologies include left optic neuritis (inflammation or infection of the left optic nerve), detachment of left retina, and an isolated small stroke involving only the left pretectal nucleus. Therefore, options (a), (d), (e), (f), and (g) are possible.
# A combined lesion in segments 3 and 5 as cause of defect is very unlikely. Microscopically precise strokes in the midbrain, involving the left pretectal nucleus, bilateral Edinger-Westphal nuclei, and their interconnecting fibers, could theoretically produce this result. Furthermore, segment 4 shares the same anatomical space in the midbrain as segment 3, therefore segment 4 will likely be affected if segment 3 is damaged. In this setting, it is very unlikely that left consensual reflex, which requires an intact segment 4, would be preserved. Therefore, options (d), (f), and (g), which all includes segment 3, are eliminated. Remaining possible options are (a) and (e).
# Based on the above reasoning, the lesion must involve segment 1. Damage to segment 5 may accompany a segment 1 lesion, but is unnecessary for producing the abnormal light reflex results in this case. Option (e) involves a combined lesion of segments 1 and 5. Multiple sclerosis, which often affects multiple neurologic sites simultaneously, could potentially cause this combination lesion. In all probability, option (a) is the answer. Neuro-imaging, such as MRI scan, would be useful for confirmation of clinical findings.

==Cognitive influences==
The pupillary response to light is not purely reflexive, but is modulated by cognitive factors, such as attention, awareness, and the way visual input is interpreted. For example, if a bright stimulus is presented to one eye, and a dark stimulus to the other eye, perception alternates between the two eyes (i.e., binocular rivalry): Sometimes the dark stimulus is perceived, sometimes the bright stimulus, but never both at the same time. Using this technique, it has been shown the pupil is smaller when a bright stimulus dominates awareness, relative to when a dark stimulus dominates awareness. This shows that the pupillary light reflex is modulated by visual awareness. Similarly, it has been shown that the pupil constricts when you covertly (i.e., without looking at) pay attention to a bright stimulus, compared to a dark stimulus, even when visual input is identical. Moreover, the magnitude of the pupillary light reflex following a distracting probe is strongly correlated with the extent to which the probe captures visual attention and interferes with task performance. This shows that the pupillary light reflex is modulated by visual attention and trial-by-trial variation in visual attention. Finally, a picture that is subjectively perceived as bright (e.g. a picture of the sun), elicits a stronger pupillary constriction than an image that is perceived as less bright (e.g. a picture of an indoor scene), even when the objective brightness of both images is equal. This shows that the pupillary light reflex is modulated by subjective (as opposed to objective) brightness.

==Mathematical model==
Pupillary light reflex is modeled as a physiologically-based non-linear delay differential equation that describes the changes in the pupil diameter as a function of the environment lighting:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the pupil diameter measured in millimeters and formula_3 is the luminous intensity reaching the retina in a time formula_4, which can be described as formula_5: luminance reaching the eye in lumens/mm2 times the pupil area in mm2. formula_6 is the pupillary latency, a time delay between the instant in which the light pulse reaches the retina and the beginning of iridal reaction due nerve transmission, neuro-muscular excitation and activation delays. formula_7, formula_8 and formula_9 are the derivatives for the formula_10 function, pupil diameter formula_2 and time formula_4.

Since the pupil constriction velocity is approximately 3 times faster than (re)dilation velocity, different step sizes in the numerical solver simulation must be used:

:formula_13

where formula_14 and formula_15 are respectively the formula_9 for constriction and dilation measured in milliseconds, formula_17 and formula_18 are respectively the current and previous simulation times (times since the simulation started) measured in milliseconds, formula_19 is a constant that affects the constriction/dilation velocity and varies among individuals. The higher the formula_19 value, the smaller the time step used in the simulation and, consequently, the smaller the pupil constriction/dilation velocity.

In order to improve the realism of the resulting simulations, the hippus effect can be approximated by adding small random variations to the environment light (in the range 0.05–0.3 Hz).

<text>Théophile-Jules Pelouze (also known as Jules Pelouze), ; 26 February 180731 May 1867) was a French chemist.

==Life==
He was born at Valognes, and died in Paris.

His father, Edmond Pelouze, was an industrial chemist and the author of several technical handbooks. The son, after spending some time in a pharmacy at La Fère acted as laboratory assistant to Gay-Lussac and Jean Louis Lassaigne at Paris from 1827 to 1829. In 1830 he was appointed associate professor of chemistry at Lille, but returning to Paris next year became &quot;repetiteur&quot;, and subsequently professor at the École polytechnique. He also held the chair of chemistry at the Collège de France, and in 1833 became assayer to the mint and in 1848 president of the &quot;Commission des Monnaies&quot;.

After the coup d&#x27;état in 1851 he resigned his appointments, but continued to conduct an experimental laboratory-school he had started in 1846. There he worked with the explosive material guncotton and other nitrosulphates. His student Ascanio Sobrero was the discoverer of nitroglycerin (1847), and another student, Alfred Nobel, was to take that discovery on to great heights in the form of commercial explosives including dynamite. He was a major inspiration for both students.

Though Pelouze made no discovery of outstanding importance, he was a busy investigator, his work including researches on salicin, on beetroot sugar, on various organic acids (gallic, malic, tartaric, butyric, lactic, etc.), on oenanthic ether (with Liebig), on the nitrosulphates, on guncotton, and on the composition and manufacture of glass.

He also carried out determinations of the atomic weights of several elements, and with Edmond Frémy, published &quot;Traité de chimie générale&quot; (1847–1850); &quot;Abrégé de chimie&quot; (1848); and &quot;Notions générales de chimie&quot; (1853).

His son Eugène-Philippe Pelouze married , a rich heiress, in 1857. The couple purchased the Château de Chenonceau in 1864. Marguerite continued to live there until 1888, when she ran out of money and was forced to sell.

His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<doc id="650981" wikidata="Q1058259" url="?curid=650981" title="Chablis wine">
<text>Chablis () is the northernmost Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée of the Burgundy region in France. Its cool climate produces wines with more acidity and less fruitiness than Chardonnay vines grown in warmer ones. These often have a &quot;flinty&quot; note, sometimes described as &quot;goût de pierre à fusil&quot; (&quot;tasting of gunflint&quot;), and sometimes as &quot;steely&quot;. The Chablis AOC is required to use Chardonnay grapes solely.

The grapevines around the town of Chablis make a dry white wine. In comparison with the white wines from the rest of Burgundy, Chablis wine has typically much less influence of oak. The amount of barrel maturation, if any, is a stylistic choice that varies widely among Chablis producers. Many Grand Cru and Premier Cru wines receive some maturation in oak barrels, but typically the time in barrel and the proportion of new barrels is much smaller than for white wines of Côte de Beaune. Wines not vinified in barrel will instead be vinified in stainless steel.

== Location ==

Chablis lies about east of Auxerre in the Yonne department, situated roughly halfway between the Côte d&#x27;Or and Paris. Of France&#x27;s wine-growing areas, only Champagne, Lorraine, Alsace and parts of Grand Auxerrois have a more northerly location. Chablis is closer to the southern Aube district of Champagne than the rest of Burgundy. 

The region encompasses across 25 communes located along the Serein river. The soil is Kimmeridge Clay with outcrops of the same chalk layer that extends from Sancerre up to the White Cliffs of Dover, giving a name to the paleontologists&#x27; Cretaceous period. The Grands Crus, the best vineyards in the area, all lie on a single, small slope, facing southwest and located just north of the town of Chablis.

== History ==
During the Middle Ages the Catholic Church, particularly Cistercian monks, became a major influence in establishing the economic and commercial interest of viticulture for the region. Pontigny Abbey was founded in 1114, and the monks planted vines along the Serein. Anséric de Montréal gave a vineyard at Chablis to the Abbey in 1186. In 1245 the chronicler Salimbene di Adam described a Chablis wine. Chardonnay is believed to have first been planted in Chablis by the Cistercians of Pontigny Abbey in the 12th century, and from there spread south to the rest of the Burgundy region.

The Chablis area became part of the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century. There are records in the mid-15th century of Chablis wine being shipped to Flanders and Picardy. But in February 1568 the town was besieged by the Huguenots, who burned part of it. 
The Seine river, easily accessible via the nearby Yonne river, gave the Chablis wine producers a near monopoly on the lucrative Parisian market. In the 17th century, the English discovered the wine and began importing large volumes. By the 19th century there were nearly of vines planted in Chablis with vineyards stretching from the town of Chablis to Joigny and Sens along the Yonne. Some Champagne producers used Chablis as a basis for a sparkling &quot;cuvée&quot;. 

With the French Revolution, the monastic vineyards became &quot;biens nationaux&quot;, and were auctioned off. The new owners were mostly local, and the political upheaval saw small farmers involved as part-time &quot;vignerons&quot;. The English market continued to prosper. The 19th-century Russian novel &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; by Leo Tolstoy mentions &quot;classic Chablis&quot; as a commonplace choice of wine.

The end of the 19th century was a difficult time for the Chablis growers. Firstly, with new railway systems linking all parts of the country with Paris, there was inexpensive wine from regions in the Midi that undercut Chablis. The vineyards were affected by oidium from 1886, and then phylloxera from 1887. Effective replacement of vinestocks to counter phylloxera took some 15 years. Many Chablis producers gave up winemaking, the acreage in the region steadily declining throughout much of the early 20th century. By the 1950s there were only of vines planted in Chablis.

The 20th century did bring about a renewed commitment to quality production and ushered in technological advances that would allow viticulture to be more profitable and reliable in this cool northern climate. In 1938, the &quot;Institut National des Appellations d&#x27;Origine&quot; created the &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) region for Chablis that mandated the grape variety (Chardonnay) and acceptable winemaking and viticultural practices within delineated boundaries. One of the objectives of the AOC establishment was to protect the name &quot;Chablis&quot;, which by this time was already being inappropriately used to refer to just about any white wine made from any number of white grape varieties all across the world. In the early 1960s, technological advances in vineyard frost protection minimized some of the risk and financial cost associated with variable vintages and climate of Chablis. The worldwide &quot;Chardonnay-boom&quot; of the mid-late 20th century opened up prosperous worldwide markets to Chablis and vineyard plantings saw a period of steady increase. By 2004, vineyard plantings in Chablis reached a little over .

==Climate and geography==

Located in northeast France, the Chablis region is considered the northernmost extension of the Burgundy wine region but it is separated from the Côte d&#x27;Or by the Morvan hills, with the main Burgundian winemaking town of Beaune located more than away. This makes the region of Chablis relatively isolated from other winemaking regions with the southern vineyards of the Champagne in the Aube department being the closest winemaking neighbor. 

The Chablis wine region has much in common with Champagne province when it comes to climate. It has a semi-continental climate without maritime influence. The peak summer growing season can be hot; and wintertime can be long, cold and harsh, with frosty conditions lasting to early May. Years that experience too much rain and low temperature tend to produce wines excessively high in acidity and fruit that is too lean to support it. Vintages that are exceedingly warm tend to produce fat, flabby wines that are too low in acidity. Frost can be countered by heaters, and aspersion by sprinklers to form an ice layer. The exceptionally poor 1972 Chablis suffered frost at vintage time.

The region of Chablis lies on the eastern edge of the Paris Basin. The region&#x27;s oldest soil dates back to the Upper Jurassic age, over 180 million years ago and includes a vineyard soil type that is calcareous, and known as Kimmeridge Clay. All of the Chablis Grand Cru and Premier Cru vineyards are planted on this primarily Kimmeridgean soil, which imparts a distinctively mineral, flinty note to the wines. Other areas, particularly most of the Petit Chablis vineyards, are planted on slightly younger Portlandian soil, still of similar structure. The chalk landscape resembles some areas of Champagne and Sancerre.

==Viticulture==

A serious viticultural concern for Chablis vineyard owners is frost protection. During the bud break period of a grapevine&#x27;s annual cycle, the Chablis region is vulnerable to springtime frost, from March to early May, which can compromise the crop yield. Formerly, the financial risk involved saw many producers turn to polyculture agriculture, pulling up vineyards to plant alternative crops. The 1957 vintage was hit particularly hard by frost damage: the regional authorities reported that only 11 cases (132 bottles) of wine were produced. 

In the 1960s, technological advances in frost protection introduced preventive measures, such as smudge pots and aspersion irrigation to the region. Smudge pots work by providing direct heat to the vines while aspersion involves spraying the vines with water as soon as temperatures hit and maintaining persistent coverage. The water freezes on the vine, shielding it with a protective layer of ice that functions igloo-style, retaining heat within the vine. While cost is a factor in using smudge pots, there is a risk with the aspersion method if the constant sprinkling of water is interrupted causing worse damage to the vine. There is no such protection against hail, which in 2016 caused serious difficulties for some Chablis vignerons.

At harvest time, AOC regulations stipulate grapes for Grand Cru vineyard must be picked with a potential alcohol level of at least 11 percent, at least 10.5 percent for Premiers Crus and 9.5 percent for AOC Chablis vineyards. Yields in Grands Crus must be limited to 45 hectoliters per hectare (3.3 tons per acre) with a 20% allowance for increased yields. There is no official regulation on the use of mechanical harvesting, but most Grand Cru producers prefer hand picking because human pickers tend to be more delicate with the grapes and can distinguish better between ripe and unripe bunches. Over the rest of the Chablis region, mechanical harvesting was used by around 80% of the vineyards at the turn of the 21st century. The traditional style of vine training in Chablis is to have the vine trained low to the ground for warmth with four cordons stretching out sideways from the trunk.

==Winemaking==
The 20th century saw many advances in winemaking technology and practices—particularly the introduction of temperature-controlled fermentation and controlled inducing of malolactic fermentation. One winemaking issue that is still contested in the region is the use of oak. Historically Chablis was aged in old wooden &quot;feuillette&quot; barrels that were essentially neutral: they did not impart the characteristic oak flavors (vanilla, cinnamon, toast, coconut, etc.) that are today associated with ageing a wine in barrels. Hygiene was difficult to control with these older barrels, and they could develop faults in the wine, including discoloration. These old barrels fell out of favor, replaced by stainless steel fermentation tanks which also controlled temperatures. 
The use of oak became controversial in the Chablis when some winemakers in the late 20th century went back to wooden barrels in winemaking, using oak barrels. So-called &quot;traditionalist&quot; winemakers dismissed the usage of oak as counter to the &quot;Chablis style&quot; or &quot;terroir&quot;, while &quot;modernist&quot; winemakers embrace its use though not to the extent of a &quot;New World&quot; Chardonnay. The amount of char in oak barrels used in Chablis is often low, which limits the &quot;toastiness&quot; that is perceived in the wine.

Rarely will a producer use oak for both fermentation and maturation. Grand Cru and Premier Cru wines are most likely to see oak: proponents believe that they have necessary structure and enough extract to avoid being overwhelmed by oak influence. While there are style differences among producers, rarely is basic AOC Chablis or Petit Chablis oaked.

While chaptalization was widely practiced for most of the 20th century, there has been a trend of riper vintages in recent years, producing grapes with higher sugar levels that have diminished the need to chaptalize.

==Appellation and classification==
The main Chablis Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée was designated on January 13, 1938, but the junior appellation of Petit Chablis was not designated until January 5, 1944. All the vineyards in Chablis are covered by four appellations with different levels of classification, reflecting all-important differences in soil and slope in this northerly region. At the top of the classification are the seven Grand Cru vineyards, which are all located on a single hillside near the town of Chablis. Second in quality are the Premier Cru vineyards, which numbered 40 at the turn of the 21st century, covering an area of . Next is the generic AOC Chablis which, at , is the largest appellation by far in the region and the one exhibits the most variability between producers and vintages. At the lowest end of the classification is &quot;Petit Chablis&quot; which includes the outlying land. As of 2004, of a permitted in the Petit Chablis appellation were planted. 

Soil and slope plays a major role in delineating the quality differences. Many of the Premier Crus, and all the Grand Crus vineyards, are planted along the valley of the Serein river as it flows into the Yonne. The Grand Crus and some of the most highly rated Premiers Crus (Mont de Milieu, Montée de Tonnerre, Fourchaume) are located on southwest facing slopes; these receive the maximum amount of sun exposure. The rest of the Premiers Crus are on southeast facing slopes. 

===Chablis Grands Crus===
There are seven officially delineated Grand Cru &quot;climats&quot;, covering an area of , all located on one southwest facing hill overlooking the town of Chablis at elevations between . One vineyard there, La Moutonne, between the Grand Cru vineyards of Les Preuses and Vaudésir, is often considered an &quot;unofficial&quot; Grand Cru. The &quot;Bureau Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bourgogne&quot; (BIVB) does recognize La Moutonne, but the seven Grand Cru vineyards officially recognized by the INAO are (from northwest to southeast): Bougros, Les Preuses, Vaudésir, Grenouilles, Valmur, Les Clos and Blanchot (also known as Les Blanchots). Together, the Grand Cru vineyards account for around 3% of Chablis annual yearly production.

While the producer can have a marked influence, each of the Grand Cru vineyards is noted for its particular &quot;terroir&quot; characteristic. Tom Stevenson notes that Blanchot produces the most delicate wine with floral aromas; Bougros is the least expressive but still has vibrant fruit flavors; Les Clos tends to produce the most complex wines with pronounced minerality; Grenouilles produces very aromatic wines with racy, elegance; the Les Preuses vineyard receives the most sun among the Grand Crus and tends to produce the most full bodied wines; Valmur is noted for its smooth texture and aromatic bouquet; Vaudésir tends to produce wines with intense flavors and spicy notes. Of all the Grand Cru vineyards, Les Clos is the largest in the area at . Hugh Johnson describes the wines from this Grand Cru as having the best ageing potential among Chablis and developing Sauternes-like aromas after some bottle age.

The Union des Grands Crus de Chablis (UGCC) was launched in March 2000 as a syndicate restricted to Grand Cru proprietors, with mission &quot;to defend and promote the quality of Chablis Grand Cru wines&quot;. Members are bound to abide by a charter that covers wine making and sales. Grand Cru makers must submit their wines to a tasting committee of other Union members to ensure they meet the required quality. These tastings are conducted blind.

===Premiers Crus===
At the turn of the 21st century, there were 40 Premier Cru vineyards. The names of many of these vineyards do not appear on wine labels. The INAO permits the use of &quot;umbrella names&quot;: smaller, lesser known vineyards are allowed to use the name of a nearby more famous Premier Cru vineyard. Some of the &quot;umbrella&quot; vineyards are Mont de Milieu, Montée de Tonnerre, Fourchaume, Vaillons, Montmains, Beauroy, Vaudevey, Vaucoupin, Vosgros, Les Fourneaux, Côte de Jouan and Les Beauregards. In general, Premier Cru wines have at least half a degree less alcohol by volume and tend to have less aromatics and intensity in flavors.

==Grapes and wine==

All Chablis is made 100% from the Chardonnay grape. Some wine experts, such as Jancis Robinson, believe that the wine from Chablis is one of the &quot;purest&quot; expressions of the varietal character of Chardonnay, because of the simple style of winemaking favored in this region. Chablis winemakers want to emphasize the &quot;terroir&quot; of the calcareous soil and cooler climate that help maintain high acidity. Chablis wines are characterized by their greenish-yellow color and clarity. The racy, green apple-like acidity is a trademark of the wines and can be noticeable in the bouquet. The acidity can mellow with age and Chablis are some of the longest living examples of Chardonnay. The wines often have a &quot;flinty&quot; note, sometimes described as &quot;goût de pierre à fusil&quot; (gunflint) and sometimes as &quot;steely&quot;. Some examples of Chablis can have an earthy &quot;wet stone&quot; flavor that intensifies as it ages, before mellowing into delicate honeyed notes. Like most white Burgundies, Chablis can benefit from some bottle age. While producers&#x27; styles and vintage can play an influential role, Grand Cru Chablis can generally age for well over 15 years while many Premiers Crus will age well for at least 10 years.

Secondary grape varieties grown locally are permitted in the generic Bourgogne AOC wine. These include Aligoté, César, Gamay, Melon de Bourgogne, Pinot noir, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris (known locally as Pinot Beurot), Sauvignon blanc, Sacy, and Tressot.

==Modern wine industry==
For most of the 20th century, Chablis wine was produced more for the export than the domestic French market, which tended to favor the Côte d&#x27;Or Chardonnays. &quot;Négociants&quot; are not as influential in the Chablis wine industry as in other areas of Burgundy. Trends towards estate bottling and co-operatives have shifted the economics towards the individual growers and producer. The La Chablisienne co-operative makes nearly a third of all wine produced in Chablis today.

In recent years, Chablis producers have fought hard to protect the Chablis designation, using legal means to make foreign countries respect it. Despite a long association with Chardonnay, the wines of Chablis can be overshadowed by the New World expression of the varietal, and by other Burgundian Chardonnays such as Montrachet, Corton-Charlemagne and Meursault. The wide semi-generic use of the word &quot;Chablis&quot; outside of France is still seen in describing almost any white wine, regardless of where it was made and from what grapes.

<text>In printing, under color removal (UCR) is a process of eliminating overlapping yellow, magenta, and cyan that would have added to a dark neutral (black) and leaving the black ink only, called a &quot;full black&quot;, during the color separation process. Under color removal is used in &quot;process color&quot; printing. Black ink used to add details and darkness in shadowed areas is called a &quot;skeletal black&quot;.

With current ink technology, the total CMYK ink in the shadows refuses to stick after it reaches the dark shadows (usually above a 250% total CMYK coverage), and begins to peel off. To prevent this, printers developed UCR, in which neutral shadowswhich would have normally been produced by overprinting the four inks &quot;cyan&quot;, &quot;magenta&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;black&quot; on top of each other (high ink coverage)are replaced with the single layer of &quot;black&quot;. UCR removes the color inks &quot;under&quot; the black, resulting in a single layer of ink which sticks to the sheet better, and saves on the consumption of ink.

There is no universal rule for UCR. The amount required will depend on the printing press, paper, and ink in use. Advantages are that it solves the ink-not-sticking problem and that using black ink is less expensive than using several colors. A disadvantage is that black ink by itself in a shadow may not be dark enough. In this case CMY colors may be added for more accurate reproduction, this process being &quot;under color addition&quot; (&quot;UCA&quot;).

UCR is generally not recommended for use in printing due to its tendency to produce dull-looking images and artwork. (This problem can often be obviated on coated paper by use of an aqueous coating or UV coating applied on the press or as post-press. A press-applied coating can also eliminate the ink-sticking problem.) The main exception to this rule is that where working in newsprint, UCR is the best way to avoid the associated ink limit and registration issues. UCR is also recommended for some specific paper stocks, depending on the coloration and texture of the paper.

<doc id="650994" wikidata="Q408688" url="?curid=650994" title="Acyl halide">
<text>An acyl halide (also known as an acid halide) is a chemical compound derived from an oxoacid by replacing a hydroxyl group () with a halide group (, where X is a halogen).

In organic chemistry, the term typically refers to acyl halides of carboxylic acids (), which contain a  functional group consisting of a carbonyl group () singly bonded to a halogen atom. The general formula for such an acyl halide can be written RCOX, where R may be, for example, an alkyl group, CO is the carbonyl group, and X represents the halide, such as chloride. Acyl chlorides are the most commonly encountered acyl halides, but acetyl iodide is the one produced (transiently) on the largest scale. Billions of kilograms are generated annually in the production of acetic acid.

== Preparation ==
===Aliphatic acyl halides===
On an industrial scale, the reaction of acetic anhydride with hydrogen chloride produces a mixture of acetyl chloride and acetic acid:

Common syntheses of acyl chlorides also entail the reaction of carboxylic acids with phosgene, thionyl chloride, and phosphorus trichloride Phosphorus pentabromide is used for acyl bromides, which are rarely of value.

===Aromatic acyl chlorides===
Benzoyl chloride is produced from benzotrichloride using either water or benzoic acid:
:
As with other acyl chlorides, it can be generated from the parent acid and other chlorinating agents phosphorus pentachloride or thionyl chloride.

Representative laboratory routes to aromatic acyl halides are comparable to those for aliphatic acyl halides. For example, chloroformylation, a specific type of Friedel-Crafts acylation which uses formaldehyde as a reagent, or by the direct chlorination of benzaldehyde derivatives.

===Acyl fluorides===
Of commercial interest, acyl chlorides react with HF to give acyl fluorides. Aromatic (as well as aliphatic) acyl fluorides are conveniently prepared directly from carboxylic acids, using stable, inexpensive commodity chemicals: , NBS and in a bench-top protocol. Cyanuric fluoride converts carboxylic acids to acyl fluorides.

Carboxylic acids react with sulfur tetrafluoride to give the acyl fluoride:

===Acyl bromides and iodides===
Acyl bromides and iodides are synthesized accordingly but are less common.

== Reactions ==
Acyl halides are rather reactive compounds often synthesized to be used as intermediates in the synthesis of other organic compounds. For example, an acyl halide can react with:
*water, to form a carboxylic acid. This hydrolysis is the most heavily exploited reaction for acyl halides as it occurs in the industrial synthesis of acetic acid.
*an alcohol to form an ester
*an amine to form an amide
*an aromatic compound, using a Lewis acid catalyst such as AlCl3, to form an aromatic ketone. &quot;See&quot; Friedel-Crafts acylation.
*carboxylic acids to form an organic acid anhydrides.

In the above reactions, HX (hydrogen halide or hydrohalic acid) is also formed. For example, if the acyl halide is an acyl chloride, HCl (hydrogen chloride or hydrochloric acid) is also formed.

== Multiple functional groups ==

A molecule can have more than one acyl halide functional group. For example, &quot;adipoyl dichloride&quot;, usually simply called adipoyl chloride, has two acyl chloride functional groups; see the structure at right. It is the dichloride (i.e., double chloride) of the 6-carbon dicarboxylic acid adipic acid. An important use of adipoyl chloride is polymerization with an organic di-amino compound to form a polyamide called nylon or polymerization with certain other organic compounds to form polyesters.

Phosgene (carbonyl dichloride, Cl–CO–Cl) is a very toxic gas that is the dichloride of carbonic acid (HO–CO–OH). Both chlorine atoms in phosgene can undergo reactions analogous to the preceding reactions of acyl halides. Phosgene is used a reactant in the production of polycarbonate polymers, among other industrial applications.

== General hazards ==
Volatile acyl halides are lachrymatory because they can react with water at the surface of the eye producing hydrohalic and organic acids irritating to the eye. Similar problems can result if one inhales acyl halide vapors. In general, acyl halides (even non-volatile compounds such as tosyl chloride) are irritants to the eyes, skin and mucous membranes.

<doc id="650995" wikidata="Q371578" url="?curid=650995" title="Reactivity series">
<text>In chemistry, a reactivity series(or reactivity series of elements) is an empirical, calculated, and structurally analytical progression of a series of metals, arranged by their &quot;reactivity&quot; from highest to lowest. It is used to summarize information about the reactions of metals with acids and water, single displacement reactions and the extraction of metals from their ores.

==Table==

Going from the bottom to the top of the table the metals:
* increase in reactivity;
* lose electrons (oxidize) more readily to form positive ions;
* corrode or tarnish more readily;
* require more energy (and different methods) to be isolated from their compounds;
* become stronger reducing agents (electron donors).

== Defining reactions ==

There is no unique and fully consistent way to define the reactivity series, but it is common to use the three types of reaction listed below, many of which can be performed in a high-school laboratory (at least as demonstrations).

=== Reaction with water and acids ===

The most reactive metals, such as sodium, will react with cold water to produce hydrogen and the metal hydroxide:

:2 Na (s) + 2 H2O (l) →2 NaOH (aq) + H2 (g)

Metals in the middle of the reactivity series, such as iron, will react with acids such as sulfuric acid (but not water at normal temperatures) to give hydrogen and a metal salt, such as iron(II) sulfate:

:Fe (s) + H2SO4 (l) → FeSO4 (aq) + H2 (g)

There is some ambiguity at the borderlines between the groups. Magnesium, aluminium and zinc &quot;can&quot; react with water, but the reaction is usually very slow unless the metal samples are specially prepared to remove the surface passivation layer of oxide which protects the rest of the metal. Copper and silver will react with nitric acid; but because nitric acid is an oxidizing acid, the oxidizing agent is not the H+ ion as in normal acids, but the NO3− ion.

== Comparison with standard electrode potentials ==
The reactivity series is sometimes quoted in the strict reverse order of standard electrode potentials, when it is also known as the &quot;electrochemical series&quot;.

The following list includes the metallic elements of the first six periods. It is mostly based on tables provided by NIST. However, not all sources give the same values: there are some differences between the precise values given by NIST and the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. In the first six periods this does not make a difference to the relative order, but in the seventh period it does, so the seventh-period elements have been excluded. (In any case, the typical oxidation states for the most accessible seventh-period elements thorium and uranium are too high to allow a direct comparison.)

Hydrogen has been included as a benchmark, although it is not a metal. Borderline germanium, antimony, and astatine have been included. Some other elements in the middle of the 4d and 5d rows have been omitted (Zr–Tc, Hf–Os) when their simple cations are too highly charged or of rather doubtful existence. Greyed-out rows indicate values based on estimation rather than experiment.
The positions of lithium and sodium are changed on such a series.

Standard electrode potentials offer a quantitative measure of the power of a reducing agent, rather than the qualitative considerations of other reactive series. However, they are only valid for &quot;standard&quot; conditions: in particular, they only apply to reactions in aqueous solution. Even with this proviso, the electrode potentials of lithium and sodium – and hence their positions in the electrochemical series – appear anomalous. The order of reactivity, as shown by the vigour of the reaction with water or the speed at which the metal surface tarnishes in air, appears to be
:Cs &gt; K &gt; Na &gt; Li &gt; alkaline earth metals,
i.e., alkali metals &gt; alkaline earth metals,

the same as the reverse order of the (gas-phase) ionization energies. This is borne out by the extraction of metallic lithium by the electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride: lithium metal is formed at the cathode, not potassium.

==Comparison with electronegativity values==
The image shows a periodic table extract with the electronegativity values of metals.

Wulfsberg distinguishes:&lt;br&gt; very electropositive metals with electronegativity values below 1.4&lt;br&gt;
 electropositive metals with values between 1.4 and 1.9; and&lt;br&gt;
 electronegative metals with values between 1.9 and 2.54.

From the image, the group 1–2 metals and the lanthanides and actinides are very electropositive to electropositive; the transition metals in groups 3 to 12 are very electropositive to electronegative; and the post-transition metals are electropositive to electronegative. The noble metals, inside the dashed border (as a subset of the transition metals) are very electronegative.

<doc id="650998" wikidata="Q5454371" url="?curid=650998" title="Fisc">
<text>Under the Merovingians and Carolingians, the fisc (from Latin &quot;fiscus,&quot; whence we derive &quot;fiscal&quot;) applied to the royal demesne which paid taxes, entirely in kind, from which the royal household was meant to be supported, though it rarely was. Though their personal territory was at first enormous, the Merovingian kings, faced with stiff resistance to taxation from their Frankish and Gallo-Roman subjects and ill-served by their illiterate peers, relied on constant conquests to renew the &quot;fisc&quot; which they were in the habit of granting away to ensure continued fidelity among their followers. Once fresh Frankish conquests were no longer forthcoming, constant redivision of the &quot;fisc&quot; among heirs reduced Merovingian kingship to a cluster of competitive kinglets subsisting on inadequate resources. Annual contributions in kind, of grain, produce, fodder, etc., were unwieldy to transport and not easily convertible, so the restless habit of Merovingian kings moving from stronghold to stronghold was constantly encouraged. As time passed, &quot;fisc&quot; began to refer to money any Frankish knight had direct control over and would carry with him. Eventually, &quot;fisc&quot; referred to any knight&#x27;s money holder.

Nowadays, &quot;fisc&quot; is still used in French and in Romanian to refer to the fiscal administration. In Spanish and in Portuguese, the slang word &quot;fisco&quot; is also used, while the German term is &quot;Fiskus&quot; and the Dutch term is &quot;fiscus&quot;.

<doc id="651004" wikidata="Q1087283" url="?curid=651004" title="Balinese caste system">
<text>The island of [[Bali]] has a system of social organization similar to the Indian caste system.

The four castes of Bali are:
* Sudras (Shudras) – peasants making up close to 93% of Bali’s population.
* Wesias (Vaishyas) – the caste of merchants and administrative officials
* Satrias (Kshatriyas) – the warriors caste, it also included some nobility and kings
* Brahmanas (Brahmins) – the priests caste

Pre-modern Bali had four castes, as Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis state, but with a &quot;very strong tradition of communal decision-making and interdependence&quot;.

==History==
The 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich suggested that the Balinese caste system had Indian origins, but Helen Creese states that scholars such as Brumund who had visited and stayed on the island of Bali suggested that his field observations conflicted with the &quot;received understandings concerning its Indian origins&quot;. In Bali, the Shudra (locally spelled &quot;Soedra&quot;) have typically been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a temple priest may also be from the other three castes. 

In most regions, it has been the Shudra who typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite &quot;meweda&quot; (Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.

The members of the four castes use different levels of the Balinese language to address members of a different caste. Middle Balinese is generally used to speak to people whose caste is unknown in an encounter. Once the caste status of the participants are established, the proper language is used to address each other.

Nowadays, the caste system is used more in religious settings where the members of the lower caste would ask the members of the Brahman caste (the Pedandas) to conduct ceremonies. Since the Dutch colonial years and more recently after the Indonesian independence, the differences in the economic roles of the members of the caste system are slowly eroding as the government prohibits treatments based on the caste system.

Most of the Kshatriya families in Java and Bali became extinct during the fall of the Majapahit and the numerous Javanese wars. Almost all of the Balinese Kshatriyas trace their origin to the royal family of King Deva Agung, who ruled 500 years before. Some of the original Kshatriyas, such as those claiming descent from Arya Damar, were relegated to Wesia status, so only those claiming descent from Deva Agung are recognized as proper Kshatriya in Bali.

During the 1950s and 1960s, there were conflicts between supporters of the traditional caste system in Bali and its opponents. Many of the latter were affiliated with the PKI, the Communist Party of Indonesia, which was violently suppressed during the Indonesian killings of 1965–1966, leading to the death of some 80,000 Balinese, around 5% of the population at the time.

<text>Christopher Charles Lloyd (born April 30, 1982), better known by his stage name Lloyd Banks, is an American rapper. He began his career as a member of East Coast hip hop group G-Unit, which he formed with childhood friends 50 Cent and Tony Yayo in 1999. After the release of their debut album &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot; (2003), Banks released his debut solo album, &quot;The Hunger for More&quot; (2004) the following year. Met with critical and commercial success, it peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top ten single, &quot;On Fire&quot;, as well as the top 20 single &quot;Karma&quot; (featuring Avant or Kevin Cossom). His second album, &quot;Rotten Apple&quot; (2006) peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and saw mixed reviews. Banks then left Interscope Records and signed with EMI in 2010—along with his G-Unit cohorts—to release his third album, &quot;H.F.M. 2 (The Hunger For More 2)&quot; in November that year, which saw a critical rebound and peaked at number 26 on the chart.

Over a decade later, he independently released his fourth album, &quot;The Course of the Inevitable&quot; (2021) to critical acclaim.

==Early life==
Christopher Lloyd was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and raised in the South Jamaica section of the Queens borough in New York City; he is of mixed Puerto Rican and African-American descent. His father spent most of Lloyd&#x27;s childhood in prison, leaving his mother to raise him and his two siblings. Lloyd attended August Martin High School but dropped out at 16. For his stage name, he took his great, great-grandfather&#x27;s name Banks, which was passed on by his uncles who also shared it.

==Career==
===Beginnings with G-Unit (1999–2004)===
G-Unit was founded when childhood friends Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent, and Tony Yayo decided to form a group. They met Young Buck when UTP group came to New York and 50 Cent heard Young Buck rapping. After 50 Cent signed his contract with Aftermath Entertainment they took Young Buck in the group and signed him.
Tony Yayo, being an older and more experienced rapper, joined 50 Cent on the Nas Promo Tour, the Cash Money Tour and the Ruff Ryders Tour. As Banks remained at home waiting for 50 and Yayo to return, he started rapping around the neighborhood to further increase his buzz on the streets. He then hooked up with neighborhood producers and recorded tracks for local mixtapes, becoming renowned on the mixtape scene. While Banks was recording Mixtapes, 50 Cent was soon granted his own record label by Dr. Dre and released the album &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;; Lloyd Banks was featured on the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Push Me&quot;, and the remixed version of &quot;P.I.M.P&quot;. Soon after the group had established their own record label, G-Unit Records, G-Unit released their first official group album &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot; in November 2003, which went on to be certified double platinum.

====Shooting====
On September 10, 2001, Banks was shot twice while leaving a nightclub in Southside Jamaica, Queens. He was hit in the back and stomach, and ran to the nearest hospital after suffering the injuries. He woke up the next morning to news of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and watched from his hospital bed as the Twin Towers fell to the ground.

====Legal issues====

During August 2005, Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, and their entourage were traveling in a van, when the vehicle was pulled over after passing through a red light in midtown Manhattan. Officers said they discovered a loaded handgun and another weapon in the van. Prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss the charges after an investigation determined that neither Lloyd Banks nor Young Buck were in possession of the weapons. Felony gun charges against Lloyd Banks and Young Buck were dropped on November 8, 2006.

In the early morning hours of January 9, 2010, in a Kitchener, Ontario hotel, an alleged altercation took place between Banks and a concert promoter over performance fees. Banks, and three of his associates, were later charged with forcible confinement, aggravated assault and robbery, and released on $50,000 bail.

====Feud with The Game====

The most well known feud involving Lloyd Banks is the feud between himself and The Game, which became public after The Game left G-Unit. Banks speculates that The Game was jealous about the attention Banks received after the success of his debut album &quot;The Hunger for More&quot; as well as Banks winning a lyricist title.

===Solo career and &quot;The Hunger for More&quot; (2004–2005)===

Lloyd Banks released his solo debut album &quot;The Hunger for More&quot; in June 2004. The first single was the summer smash hit &quot;On Fire&quot; which featured 50 Cent, however he was uncredited.
Banks explained the reasoning behind the album&#x27;s title:

The album was a commercial success, receiving positive reviews. It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard charts with over 433,000 copies sold in the first week. The album has since sold over 1.5 million copies and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

During an interview, Lloyd Banks commented on his first week sales:

Two other singles were also released from &quot;The Hunger For More&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So Fly&quot; and &quot;Karma&quot;, the latter was a hit reaching number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 9 on the R&amp;B charts and number 6 on the rap charts. 

At the time of the album&#x27;s release, Lloyd Banks was managed by Sha Money XL and Teamwork Music.

===&quot;Rotten Apple&quot; (2006–2008)===
&quot;The Big Withdrawal&quot; was originally intended to be Lloyd Banks&#x27; second album. The album was leaked to the internet after Banks had a ménage à trois encounter with two women and left the CD album behind. The leaked version of the album contained 23 tracks.
During an interview, Lloyd Banks commented on the issue, he said: 

Due to the leak, Lloyd Banks began work on &quot;Rotten Apple&quot;. &quot;Rotten Apple&quot; is a play on New York City&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Big Apple&quot;. It was released on October 10, 2006. The album debuted at #3, selling 143,000 copies in its first week. &quot;Rotten Apple&quot; was not considered as a commercial success because his debut album sold a significantly higher number of copies in its first week. He has released three singles from &quot;Rotten Apple&quot;: &quot;Hands Up&quot;, &quot;The Cake&quot;, and &quot;Help&quot;.

===Departure from Interscope (2009)===
Banks was dropped from Interscope Records in 2009.
 He is still signed to G-Unit Records, which will release his new album. Banks released a mixtape on his 27th birthday, which fell on April 30, 2009; it included the track &quot;Officer Down&quot; that dissed Rick Ross. Banks also released a mixtape in 2009 called V5.

In 2010, a year later, Interscope Records reached back out to try to re-sign Lloyd Banks. Banks did not go for it and put his third album out under G-Unit Records.

===&quot;The Hunger for More 2&quot; and signing with EMI (2010–2013)===

In late January 2010, it was announced that Banks would release a new song, &quot;Beamer, Benz, or Bentley&quot; featuring Juelz Santana, from his upcoming third studio album. &quot;Beamer, Benz, or Bentley&quot; charted at #49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In early June, Banks released the second single off the album, &quot;Any Girl&quot; featuring R&amp;B singer Lloyd. Later on November 2, 2010, he released the third single Start It Up featuring Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Ryan Leslie and Fabolous. Lloyd released the fourth single off the album, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Deserve You&quot;, featuring R&amp;B singer Jeremih.

Banks release info via his Twitter announcing that the title for his third album has tentatively been called &#x27;The Hunger for More 2&#x27; and will attempt to take him back to his best work. However, the G-Unit label later stated that the title is not set in concrete and still may be altered. The title of the album was confirmed by 50 Cent as &quot;The Hunger for More 2&quot; in an interview with MTV News. According to Banks, Interscope is trying to get him back due to the success of the single &quot;Beamer, Benz, or Bentley&quot;, but failed when Lloyd Banks revealed that he had signed a deal with EMI.

After being dropped by Interscope Records in 2009, Lloyd Banks announced on Friday, August 13, 2010, on MTV News that EMI Label Services has signed a deal with 50 Cent&#x27;s label, G-Unit Records, in which EMI will distribute and promote releases on the G-Unit roster in North America including Lloyd Banks third album &quot;H.F.M. 2 (Hunger for More 2)&quot;. On October 18, 2011, Banks was featured on the remix of Queen&#x27;s Rapper Trav&#x27;s single &quot;Ride The Wave&quot; alongside Juelz Santana.

Banks&#x27; had this to say about the deal,

===Resurgence with G-Unit (2014–2018)===
During a performance at BB King&#x27;s in New York City on August 2, 2015, Banks addressed his long-awaited &quot;Cold Corner 3&quot; mixtape and expressed disappointment at the current state of hip-hop. He explained that the project would be released commercially, and available for pre-order. However, if he&#x27;s not satisfied with the pre-order numbers, it will not be released.

=== Departure from G-Unit and 50 Cent feud (2018–present) ===

Lloyd banks left G-Unit Records in June 2018, as announced in an Instagram post by 50 Cent. Despite public perception largely being that the relationship between 50 Cent and Lloyd Banks was amicable, as 50 Cent had recently told fans to check out Banks&#x27; new mixtape, 50 Cent later spoke about the different members of G-Unit in an interview with Big Boy and said &quot;Banks, he just... I don&#x27;t even know. He couldn&#x27;t even tell you like at any point when you speak to him where the problem is. I put him like where I put Marquise, like they just have something internal going on with them that gives them some sort of resentment towards me, and I just don&#x27;t even care about what&#x27;s going on&quot;. Trav, a former associate of G-Unit, then went on Instagram live and spoke on the matter, saying: &quot;Banks [sic] father died, bro, and Banks was sad, bro. All Banks wanted to do was him to pull up like, &#x27;yo, bro. I&#x27;m sorry for your condolences.&#x27; Because the nigga 50 don&#x27;t come from no family, he tried to play like this fake role. Like man, you ain&#x27;t even know your father&quot;. 50 Cent went on to call Lloyd Banks &quot;lazy&quot; in his book Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter which Lloyd Banks would seemingly respond to in his song Stranger Things. Lloyd Banks hasn&#x27;t spoke on the matter publicly however he has sent words that seem to be aimed at 50 Cent on numerous songs including Cold Summer Freestyle and Stranger Things. In-between Lloyd Banks departure from G-Unit and June 2021, he remained relatively quiet other than introducing a clothing line and touring places such as Australia, Lloyd banks wasn&#x27;t doing interviews or releasing any new projects other than some freestyles. In fact, Lloyd Banks hadn&#x27;t released a new project since his mixtape Halloween Havoc 3 in 2016. He would also go on to twitter to tweet things such as &quot;Let&#x27;s be real..ain&#x27;t nobody checking for Banks anymore&quot; leaving fans wondering if Lloyd Banks was done with music. However fans would be surprised as in April 2021 he would release a post on Instagram that teased possible new music which continued on May 25, when a video was released with a brief spoken-word monologue from poet Rashan Brown and a tracklist and cover art were revealed the same day. The album was released on June 4, 2021, as his 4th album and first album in 11 years named &quot;The Course of the Inevitable&quot; which sold 12,000 copies in its first week. The album received very positive reviews and Lloyd Banks seemed happy with the reception as he spoke about more upcoming music at a concert he held in Sony Hall.

==Awards==
In 2004, Banks was awarded 2004&#x27;s Mixtape artist of the Year at the Mixtape Awards. Lloyd Banks commented on this award in an interview with AOL Sessions:
In 2005, &quot;On Fire&quot; was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2006, &quot;Touch It [Remix]&quot; was nominated for Hip-Hop Video of the Year, and won for Best Collaboration at the BET Awards. The award was shared by Banks and his collaborators, Busta Rhymes, Mary J. Blige, Rah Digga, Missy Elliott, Papoose, and DMX. In 2010 with the excitement surrounding the release of &quot;H.F.M. 2 (Hunger for More 2)&quot; and his return to Hip-Hop&#x27;s spotlight Hip-Hop news website HipHopDX wrote that Banks had the &quot;Comeback of the Year&quot;.

<text>Glebionis segetum (syn. &quot;Chrysanthemum segetum&quot;) is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, probably native only to the eastern Mediterranean region but now naturalized in western and northern Europe as well as China and parts of North America. Common names include corn marigold and corn daisy.

&quot;Glebionis segetum&quot; has been hybridized with related &quot;Argyranthemum&quot; species to create cultivars of garden marguerites.

&quot;Glebionis segetum&quot; is a herbaceous annual plant growing to 80 cm tall, with spirally arranged, deeply lobed leaves 5–20 cm long. The flowers are bright yellow, produced in capitula (flowerheads) 3.5-5.5 cm in diameter, with a ring of ray florets and a centre of disc florets.

&quot;Glebionis segetum&quot; is widely naturalised outside of its native range, colonising western and central Europe with early human agriculture; it can be an invasive weed in some areas. However, it also was ranked very highly, in terms of nectar production, thus showing particular value in the role of nectar-provider for insects in a UK survey of meadow species&#x27; production of nectar sugar and pollen. &quot;Glebionis segetum&quot; was practically an exact equivalent in terms of how much nectar and pollen it produced in this study with the popular garden and meadow plant, cornflower &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; — the top producer of nectar sugar among the cultivated plants in the study (as opposed to those classified as weeds). Its long blooming period helps its ranking, as it does not have few flowers with very high nectar volume per flower — coupled with a brief blooming period that completely exhausts the plant, like some top-ranked plants in nectar sugar production surveys (e.g. Bull Thistle, &quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot;). The plant strongly attracts very small butterflies (such as the &quot;Pearl Crescent&quot;) and also small hoverflies such as &quot;Toxomerus marginatus&quot;. Japanese beetles will consume the petals.

The corn marigold appears to have been a serious weed during the 13th century in Scotland, as suggested by a law of Alexander II which states that if a farmer allows so much as a single plant to produce seed in amongst his crops, then he will be fined a sheep.

In Crete and Greece, the leaves and the tender shoots of a variety called &quot;neromantilida&quot; (νερομαντηλίδα) are eaten raw in salads or browned in hot olive oil by the locals.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Glebionis segetum&quot; was formerly treated in the genus &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;, but under a 1999 decision of the International Botanical Congress, that genus has been redefined with a different circumscription to include the economically important florist&#x27;s chrysanthemum (now &quot;Chrysanthemum indicum&quot;).

The epithet &quot;segetum&quot; is a plural noun in the genitive case, meaning &quot;of the corn[fields]&quot;, so does not change its ending to agree with the feminine genus name.

<text>The dialogue editor is a type of sound editor who assembles, synchronizes, and edits all the dialogue in a film or television production. Usually, they will use the production tracks: the sound that was recorded on the set. If any of the production tracks are unusable they can be replaced by either alternate production tracks recorded on set or by ADR, automated dialogue replacement, which is recorded after the shoot with the actors watching their performances in a sound studio and rerecording the lines. Large productions may have an ADR editor working under the dialogue editor, but the positions are often combined. The ADR editor or dialogue editor also work with the walla group in films which they are required, providing the background chatter noise in scenes with large crowds, such as parties or restaurants.

Once the dialogue editor has completed the dialogue track, the re-recording mixer then mixes it with the music and sound effects tracks to produce the final soundtrack.

<doc id="651019" wikidata="Q4850935" url="?curid=651019" title="Balinese Hinduism">
<text>Balinese Hinduism (; , &quot;Hindusmé Bali&quot;), also known in Indonesia as &quot;Agama Hindu Dharma&quot;, &quot;Agama Tirtha&quot;, &quot;Agama Air Suci&quot; or &quot;Agama Hindu Bali&quot;, is the form of Hinduism practised by the majority of the population of Bali. This is particularly associated with the Balinese people residing on the island, and represents a distinct form of Hindu worship incorporating local animism, ancestor worship or &quot;Pitru Paksha&quot;, and reverence for Buddhist saints or &quot;Bodhisattava&quot;.

The population of Indonesian islands is predominantly Muslim (87%). The island of Bali is an exception where about 87% of its people identify as Hindu (about 1.7% of the total Indonesian population).

The 1945 Constitution of Indonesia guarantees freedom of religion to all citizens. In 1952, states Michel Picard, an anthropologist and scholar of Balinese history and religion, the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs came under the control of conservatives who severely constrained an acceptable definition of a &quot;religion&quot;. To be acceptable as an official Indonesian religion, the past ministry defined &quot;religion&quot; as one that is monotheistic, has codified religious law and added several requirements.

Further, Indonesia denied rights of citizenship (such as the right to vote) to anyone not belonging to an officially recognized religion. As such, Balinese Hinduism has been formally recognized by the Indonesian government as one of the official religions practised in Bali.

==History==
Hindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century CE. Historical evidence is unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to 78 CE. Stories from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century, whose versions mirror those found in Tamil Nadu.

Similarly, ancient &quot;Chandis&quot; (temples) excavated in Java and western Indonesian islands, as well as ancient inscriptions such as the 8th century Canggal inscription discovered in Indonesia, confirm the widespread adoption of Shiva lingam iconography, his companion goddess Parvati, Ganesha, Vishnu, Brahma, Arjuna, and other Hindu deities by about the middle to late 1st-millennium CE. Ancient Chinese records of Fa Hien on his return voyage from Ceylon to China in 414 CE mention two schools of Hinduism in Java, while Chinese documents from the 8th century refer to the Hindu kingdom of King Sanjaya as &quot;Holing&quot;, calling it &quot;exceedingly wealthy,&quot; and say that it coexisted peacefully with the Buddhist people and Sailendra ruler in the Kedu Plain of the Java island.

About 1400 CE, the kingdoms on the Indonesian islands were attacked by coast-based Muslim armies. During the 15th and 16th centuries, this Muslim campaign led by Sultans targeted Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms and various communities in the Indonesian archipelago, with each Sultan trying to carve out a region or island for control.

Four diverse and contentious Islamic Sultanates emerged in north Sumatra (Aceh), south Sumatra, west and central Java, and southern Borneo (Kalimantan). The violence ended the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms and communities in many of the islands of Indonesia.

In other cases, Hindus and Buddhists left and concentrated as communities on islands that they could defend, and the sultans allowed them a safe haven on Bali island. Hindus of western Java moved east and then to the island of Bali and the neighbouring small islands, thus starting Balinese Hinduism. While this era of religious conflict and inter-Sultanate warfare was unfolding, and new power centres were attempting to consolidate regions under their control, European colonialism arrived. The Indonesian archipelago was soon dominated by the Dutch colonial empire.

The Dutch colonial empire helped prevent inter-religious conflict, and it slowly began the process of excavating, understanding and preserving Indonesia&#x27;s ancient Hindu-Buddhist cultural foundations, particularly in Java and the western islands of Indonesia.

Upon independence from Dutch colonial rule, Article 29 of the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia guaranteed freedom of religion to all its citizens. In 1952, states Michel Picard, the Indonesian Ministry of Religion came under the control of Islamists who severely constrained the acceptable definition of a &quot;religion&quot;. To be acceptable as an official Indonesian religion, the ministry defined &quot;religion&quot; as one that is monotheistic, has codified religious law, possesses a prophet and a Holy Book, amongst other requirements. Balinese Hindus were declared as &quot;people without a religion&quot;, and available to be converted. Balinese Hindus disagreed, debated, adapted, and declared their form of Hinduism to be monotheistic, and presented it in a form to be eligible for the status of &quot;agama&quot; under the 1952 amended articles.

To accomplish this, the Balinese Hindus initiated a series of student and cultural exchange initiatives between Bali and India to help formulate the core principles behind Balinese Hinduism (Catur Veda, Upanishad, Puranas, Itihasa). In particular, the political self-determination movement in Bali in the mid-1950s led to the joint petition of 1958 which demanded the Indonesian government recognize Hindu Dharma. This joint petition quoted the following Sanskrit mantra from the Hindu scriptures:

The petition&#x27;s focus on the &quot;undivided one&quot; was to satisfy the constitutional requirement that Indonesian citizens have a monotheistic belief in one God. The petitioners identified Ida Sanghyang Widhi Wasa as the undivided one. In the Balinese language, this term has two meanings: &quot;the Divine ruler of the Universe&quot; and &quot;the Divine Absolute Cosmic Law&quot;. This creative phrase met the monotheistic requirement of the Indonesian Ministry of Religion in the former sense, while the latter sense of its meaning preserved the central ideas of dharma in ancient scripts of Hinduism.

Bali became the only part of Indonesia to remain predominantly Hindu.

==Key beliefs==

Balinese Hinduism is an amalgamation of Hinduism with elements from Buddhism and pre-existing indigenous animist customs that permeated in the Indonesian archipelago before the arrival of Hinduism.

It integrates many of the core beliefs of Hinduism with the arts and rituals of the Balinese people. In contemporary times, Hinduism in Bali is officially referred to by the Indonesian Ministry of Religion as &quot;Agama Hindu Dharma&quot;, but traditionally the religion was called by many names such as &quot;Tirta, Trimurti, Hindu, Agama Tirta, Siwa, Buda,&quot; and &quot;Siwa-Buda.&quot;

The terms &quot;Tirta&quot; and &quot;Trimurti&quot; emanate from Indian Hinduism, corresponding to Tirtha (pilgrimage to spirituality near holy waters) and Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva) respectively. As in India, Hinduism in Bali grew with flexibility, featuring a diverse way of life. It includes many Indian spiritual ideas, cherishes the legends and beliefs of the Indian &quot;Puranas&quot; and Hindu Epics, and expresses its traditions through a unique set of festivals and customs associated with a myriad of &quot;hyangs&quot; - the local and ancestral spirits, as well as forms of animal sacrifice that are not common in India.
The general beliefs and practices of &quot;Agama Hindu Dharma&quot; as practised in Bali are a mixture of ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of &quot;panca sila&quot;.

Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, how and where to pray. However, officially, the Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognized beliefs that comply with its national ideology.

Indonesian school textbooks describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam. Scholar&#x27;s contest whether these Indonesian government recognized and assigned beliefs to reflect the traditional Balinese Hindu beliefs and practices before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.

Some of the Hindu beliefs officially recognized by the Indonesian Ministry of Religion include:
*A belief in one supreme being called &quot;Ida Sanghyang Widi Wasa&quot;, &quot;Sang Hyang Tunggal&quot;, or &quot;Sang Hyang Acintya&quot;.
*A belief that all of the gods are manifestations of this supreme being. This belief is the same as the belief of Smartism, which also holds that the different forms of gods and goddesses, Vishnu, Siva, Shakti (Devi) are different aspects of the same Supreme Being. Shiva is also worshipped in other forms such as &quot;Batara Guru&quot; and &quot;Maharaja Dewa&quot; (Mahadeva).

The sacred texts found in &quot;Agama Hindu Dharma&quot; are the Vedas and Upanishads. They are the bases of Indian and Balinese Hinduism. Other sources of religious information include the Universal Hindu Puranas and the Itihasa (mainly Ramayana and the Mahabharata). The epics Mahabharata and Ramayana became enduring traditions among Indonesian believers, expressed in shadow puppets (&quot;wayang&quot;) and dance performances. As in India, Indonesian Hinduism recognizes four paths of spirituality, calling it &quot;Catur Marga&quot;. These are &quot;bhakti mārga&quot; (path of devotion to deities), &quot;jnana mārga&quot; (path of knowledge), &quot;karma mārga&quot; (path of works) and &quot;raja mārga&quot; (path of meditation). Bhakti Marga has the largest following in Bali.

Similarly, like Hindus in India, Balinese Hindus believe that there are four proper goals of human life, calling it &quot;Catur Purusartha&quot; - &quot;dharma&quot; (the pursuit of moral and ethical living), &quot;artha&quot; (the pursuit of wealth and creative activity), &quot;kama&quot; (the pursuit of joy and love) and &quot;moksha&quot; (the pursuit of self-knowledge and liberation).

=== God and deities ===
Balinese Hinduism includes the Indian trinity concept called Trimurti consisting of:
*Brahma
*Wisnu or Vishnu
*Çiwa or Siwa or Shiva

In Balinese Hindu texts, the alternate tripartite concept of Shiva of Indian Shaivism is also found. This is usually referred in Balinese as &quot;Siwa-Sadasiwa-Paramasiwa&quot;, where Shiva is the creator, the maintainer and the destroyer of cyclic existence.

Along with the traditional Hindu trinity, Balinese Hindus worship a range of gods and goddesses (&quot;Hyang, Dewata&quot; and &quot;Batara-Batari&quot;), as well others that are unique and not found in Indian Hinduism. Sang Hyang Widhi literally means &quot;Divine Order&quot;, also known as Acintya (&quot;Inconceivable&quot;) or Sang Hyang Tunggal (&quot;Divine Oneness&quot;), is the concept in Balinese tradition of Hinduism that parallels the metaphysical concept of Brahman among Indian Hindus. Ceremonies include an empty high-seated chair. It is also found at the top of the &quot;Padmasana&quot; shrine outside houses and temples. This is for Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa.

===Ethical values===

The axiological ideas of Balinese Hinduism parallel those in Indian Hinduism. However, states Martin Ramstedt – a scholar of Hinduism in Southeast Asia, they are termed somewhat differently and passed on from one generation to the next as a community and at spiritual ceremonies. Unlike the Islamic schools in Indonesia and Hindu Ashrams in India, and in light of the official representation of Balinese Hinduism, the traditional precepts and values are acquired at home, rituals, and religious symbols.

For example, the symbolism connected with the sprinkling of &quot;tirtha&quot;, or holy water that bridges the material and the spiritual, this water is first sprinkled overhead and is understood as &quot;purification of &quot;manah&quot; (mind)&quot;, then sipped to be understood as &quot;purification of &quot;wak&quot; (speech)&quot;, and then sprinkled over the body symbolizing &quot;purification of &quot;kaya&quot; (attitude and behaviour)&quot;. Thus, states Ngurah Nala, the younger generation becomes &quot;acquainted with the ethical values embodied in the concept of &quot;Tri Kaya Parisudha&quot;, or the attainment of a pure or good mind (&quot;manacika&quot;), pure or good speech (&quot;wacika&quot;), and pure conduct (&quot;kayika&quot;)&quot;.

===Birth and life===
There are a total of thirteen ceremonies concerned with life from conception until, but not including, death, each of which has four elements: placation of evil spirits, purification with holy water, wafting of the essence, and prayer. These ceremonies mark major events in a person&#x27;s life, including birth, puberty, grain feeding, and marriage.

A newborn baby is believed to represent the soul of an ancestor and is regarded as a god for the first 42 days of its life. However, the mother is regarded as impure and is not allowed to participate in any religious activities during this period. A baby must not touch the impure ground until it is 105 days old, halfway to the celebration of its first birthday according to the 210-day Balinese &quot;Pawukon&quot; calendar. Once it reaches its first birthday, the child&#x27;s family will celebrate the Otonan birthday ceremony. Once the child reaches puberty, the six upper canine teeth are filed until they are even.

===Death and reincarnation===
The most important ceremonies take place after death and result in the soul being freed to be eventually reincarnated. Unlike the death rites of other religions, the physical body is not the focus, as it is seen as nothing more than a temporary container of the soul and fit only for expedient disposal. In fact, the body must be burned before the soul can leave it completely. The cremation ceremony to bring this about can be extremely expensive because an elaborate ceremony is a way of showing respect for a soul destined to become a god with considerable powers over those left behind. Therefore, bodies are sometimes temporarily buried until the family can accumulate enough funds for cremation, although the bodies of priests or high-class families are preserved above ground.

==Festivals==

===Galungan and Kuningan===
The most important festival is &quot;Galungan&quot; (related to Deepavali), a celebration of the triumph of &quot;dharma&quot; over &quot;adharma&quot;. It is calculated according to the 210-day Balinese &quot;Pawukon&quot; calendar and takes place on the Wednesday (&quot;Buda&quot;) of the eleventh week (&quot;Dunggulan&quot;). According to tradition, the spirits of the dead descend from Heaven, to return ten days later on &quot;Kuningan&quot;.

===Nyepi===
&quot;Nyepi&quot;, or the Day of Silence, makes the start of the Balinese &quot;Saka&quot; year and is marked on the first day of the 10th month, &quot;Kedasa&quot;. It usually falls in March.

===Other festivals===
&quot;Watugunung&quot;, the last day of the &quot;Pawukon calendar&quot;, is devoted to Saraswati, goddess of learning. Although it is devoted to books, reading is not allowed. The fourth day of the year is called &quot;Pagerwesi&quot;, meaning &quot;iron fence&quot;. It commemorates a battle between good and evil.

==Varna system==
Balinese caste structure has been described in early 20th-century European literature to be based on three categories – &quot;triwangsa&quot; (three classes) or the nobility, &quot;dwijati&quot; (twice-born) in contrast to ekajati (once born) the common folks. Four statuses were identified in these sociological studies, spelled a bit differently from the caste categories for India:

* &quot;Brahmanas&quot; – priest
* &quot;Satrias&quot; – knighthood
* &quot;Wesias&quot; – commerce
* &quot;Sudras&quot; – servitude

The &quot;Brahmana&quot; caste was further subdivided by these Dutch ethnographers into two: &quot;Siwa&quot; and &quot;Buda&quot;. The &quot;Siwa&quot; caste was subdivided into five – &quot;Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba,&quot; and &quot;Petapan.&quot; This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher caste &quot;Brahmana&quot; men with lower caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to caste system studies in British colonies such as India.

==Processions and colors==
Bali has a caste system similar to the Indian system in its ancient form. In ancient India, caste was called &quot;varna&quot;, meaning the colouring of the neutral or transparent soul or the propensity of the soul to behave according to certain tendencies based on its innate nature. Based on this propensity people selected their profession. Later this process through erosion became a family lineage/birth-based system. This same system has been adopted in Bali and it is called &#x27;&quot;Wangsa&quot;&#x27; which is related to the professions of the ancestors. However, even in Bali today, irrespective of the profession of the individual, they claim to belong to their family wangsa. There are four basic wangsa or professions, known collectively as &quot;caturwangsa&quot;—all Balinese belong to this group. The top three wangsa are &quot;Brahmana&quot;, &quot;Satria&quot; (or &quot;Ksatriya&quot;) and &quot;Wesia&quot; (or &quot;Wesya&quot;), represent nobility, and are known as &quot;triwangsa&quot;. The fourth and most common wangsa is &quot;Sudra&quot;.

These wangsa groups are subdivided, and each has certain names associated with it. The teachers and priests, &quot;Brahmanans&quot;, have five subdivisions, and are said to be descended from one individual. Men and women have Ida as their first name. The &quot;Ksatriya&quot; are traditional rulers and warriors. Typical names of this wangsa are &quot;Dewa Agung&quot;, &quot;Anak Agung&quot; and &quot;I Dewa&quot;. The &quot;Wesia&quot; are considered to have been merchants of different kinds. The most common wangsa in Bali in terms of numbers is &quot;Sudra&quot; since 90% of Balinese Hindus belong to it; they make up the common people as farmers and others. The &quot;Pandes&quot; or Blacksmiths have a special &#x27;clan&#x27; that is not mentioned in the Catur Wangsa group but is considered especially important for its skilled works and being the smiths of fire, &quot;Dewa&quot; Agni or &quot;Dewa&quot; Brahma.

==Dietary law==
Under no circumstances may Balinese Hindus consume the flesh of human, cat, monkey, dog, crocodile, mouse, snake, frog, certain poisonous fish, leech, stinging insect, crow, eagle, owl, or any other bird of prey.

Chicken, fruit, vegetables and seafood are widely consumed. Hindus, especially those who belong to the varna (caste) of &quot;Brahmin&quot; and &quot;Kshatriya&quot;, are forbidden to consume or even touch beef and rarely touch pork; additionally, they must not eat on the street or marketplace, drink alcohol, or taste offerings of such items.

==Outside Bali and Indonesia==

Balinese Hindus built Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta, the second largest temple in Indonesia after Pura Besakih in Bali, dedicated to Hindu Sundanese King Sri Baduga Maharaja Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata Prabu Siliwangi. Pura Aditya Jaya is the largest temple in Indonesian capital Jakarta.

At least four Balinese Hindu temples exist in Europe. A padmasana exists in Hamburg, Germany in front of the Museum of Ethnology, Hamburg. Pura Girinatha in Dili, Timor Leste, was built by Indonesian immigrants. The recently constructed Pura Tri Hita Karana is located in Erholungspark Marzahn park in Berlin, Germany. Two temples exist in the Pairi Daiza botanical garden in Belgium.

<doc id="651031" wikidata="Q2063661" url="?curid=651031" title="Toilet training">
<text>Toilet training (also potty training or toilet learning) is the process of training someone, particularly a toddler or infant, to use the toilet for urination and defecation. Attitudes toward training in recent history have fluctuated substantially, and may vary across cultures and according to demographics. Many of the contemporary approaches to toilet training favor a behaviorism and cognitive psychology-based approach.

Specific recommendations on techniques vary considerably, although a range of these are generally considered effective, and specific research on their comparative effectiveness is lacking. No single approach may be universally effective, either across learners or for the same learner across time, and trainers may need to adjust their techniques according to what is most effective in their situation. Training may begin shortly after birth in some cultures. However, in much of the developed world this occurs between the age of 18 months and two years, with the majority of children fully trained by age four, although many children may still experience occasional accidents.

Certain behavioral or medical disorders may affect toilet training, and extend the time and effort necessary for successful completion. In certain circumstances, these will require professional intervention by a medical professional. However, this is rare and even for those children who face difficulties in training, the vast majority of children can be successfully trained.

Children may face certain risks associated with training, such as slips or falling toilet seats, and toilet training may act in some circumstances as a trigger for abuse. Certain technologies have been developed for use in toilet training, some specialized and others commonly used.

==History==

Little is known about toilet training in pre-modern societies. Ancient Rome has been credited with the earliest known children&#x27;s toilet. However, there is no evidence of what training techniques they may have employed. Later, during the European Middle Ages, according to one source &quot;Recommended cures for &#x27;pyssying the bedde&#x27;...included consumption of ground hedgehog or powdered goat claw and having dried rooster combs sprinkled on the bed.&quot;

Cultural beliefs and practices related to toilet training in recent times have varied. For example, beginning in the late 18th century parenting transitioned from the use of leaves or linens (or nothing) for the covering of a child&#x27;s genitals, to the use of cloth diapers (or nappies), which needed to be washed by hand. This was followed by the advent of mechanical washing machines, and then to the popularisation of disposable diapers in the mid 20th century, each of which decreased the burden on parental time and resources needed to care for children who were not toilet trained, and changed expectations about the timeliness of training. This trend did not manifest equally in all parts of the world. Those living in poorer countries usually train as early as possible, as access to amenities such as disposable diapers may still pose a significant burden. Poorer families in developed countries also tend to train earlier than their more affluent peers.

Much of the 20th-century conceptualization of toilet training was dominated by psychoanalysis, with its emphasis on the unconscious, and warnings about potential psychological impacts in later life of toilet training experiences. For example, anthropologist Geoffrey Gorer attributed much of contemporary Japanese society in the 1940s to their method of toilet training, writing that &quot;early and severe toilet training is the most important single influence in the formation of the adult Japanese character.&quot; Some German child-rearing theorists of the 1970s tied Nazism and the Holocaust to authoritarian, sadistic personalities produced by punitive toilet training.

Into the 20th century this was largely abandoned in favor of behaviouralism, with an emphasis on the ways in which rewards and reinforcements increase the frequency of certain behaviors, and cognitive psychology, with an emphasis on meaning, cognitive ability, and personal values. Writers such as psychologist and pediatrician Arnold Gesell, along with pediatrician Benjamin Spock were influential in re-framing the issue of toilet training as one of biology and child readiness.

==Approaches==
Approaches to toilet training have fluctuated between &quot;passive child readiness&quot; (&quot;nature&quot;-based approaches), which emphasize individual child readiness, and more &quot;structured behaviorally based&quot; (&quot;nurture&quot;-based approaches), which emphasize the need for parents to initiate a training regime as soon as possible. Among the more popular methods are the Brazelton child-oriented approach, the approach outlined in &quot;The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care&quot; by Benjamin Spock, the methods recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the &quot;toilet training in a day&quot; approach developed by Nathan Azrin and Richard M. Foxx. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, both the Brazelton and the Azrin/Foxx approaches are effective for developmentally normal children, although the evidence has been limited, and no study has directly compared the effectiveness of the two. Recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics follow closely with Brazelton, and at least one study has suggested that the Azrin/Foxx method was more effective than that proposed by Spock.

Opinions may vary greatly among parents regarding what the most effective approach to toilet training is, and success may require multiple or varied techniques according to what a child is most responsive to. These may include the use of educational material, like children&#x27;s books, regularly querying a child about their need to use the bathroom, demonstration by a parent, or some type of reward system. Some children may respond more positively to more brief but intense toilet training, while others may be more successful adjusting more slowly over a longer period of time. Regardless of the techniques used, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that the strategy utilize as much parental involvement and encouragement as possible, while avoiding negative judgement.

The Canadian Paediatric Society makes a number of specific recommendations for toilet training techniques. These include:
* Using a toilet seat adapter, foot stool, or potty chair to ensure easy access for the child
* Encouraging and praising the child when they inform caregivers of their need to evacuate, even when done after the fact
* Being attentive to a child&#x27;s behavioural cues that may indicate their need to evacuate 
* Prefer encouragement and praise and avoid punishment or negative reinforcement
* Ensure all caregivers are consistent with their approach
* Consider transition to cotton underwear or training pants once the child achieves repeated success

===Timeline===
As psychologist Johnny L. Matson observes, using the toilet can be a complex process to master, from the ability to recognize and control bodily functions, to the skills required to carry out proper hygiene practices, the requisite dexterity to dress and undress oneself, and the communication skills to inform others of the need to use the toilet. Usually around one year of age, a child will begin to recognize the need to evacuate, which might be observed through changes in behavior immediately prior to urination or defecation. Although they may recognize the need, children younger than 18 months may not yet be able to consciously control the muscles involved in elimination, and cannot yet begin toilet training. While they may use the toilet if placed there by a parent at an opportune time, this likely remains an involuntary, rather than a conscious process. This will gradually change over the course of many months or years, with nighttime bowel control usually the first to manifest, followed by daytime control, and nighttime bladder control normally last.

Toilet training practice may vary greatly across cultures. For example, researchers such as Mary Ainsworth have documented families in Chinese, Indian, and African cultures beginning toilet training as early as a few weeks or months of age. In Vietnam, toilet training begins shortly after birth, with toilet training complete by age 2. This may be mediated by a number of factors, including cultural values regarding excrement, the role of caregivers, and the expectation that mothers work, and how soon they are expected to return to work following childbirth.

In 1932, the U.S. Government recommended that parents begin toilet training nearly immediately after birth, with the expectation that it would be complete by the time the child was six to eight months of age. However, this shifted over time, with parents in the early 20th century beginning training at 12–18 months of age, and shifting by the latter half of the century, to an average of greater than 18 months. In the US and Europe, training normally starts between 21 and 36 months, with only 40 to 60% of children trained by 36 months.

Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Canadian Paediatric Society recommend that parents begin toilet training around 18 months of age so long as the child is interested in doing so. There is some evidence to suggest that children who are trained after their second year, may be at a higher risk for certain disorders, such as urological problem or daytime wetting. There is no evidence of any psychological problems resulting from initiating training too early. In a study of families in the United Kingdom, researchers found that 2.1% began training prior to six months, 13.8% between 6 and 15 months, 50.4% between 15 and 24 months, and 33.7% had not begun training at 24 months.

The majority of children will achieve complete bladder and bowel control between ages two and four. While four-year-olds are usually reliably dry during their waking hours, as many as one in five children aged five will occasionally wet themselves during the night. Girls tend to complete successful training at a somewhat younger age than their male peers, and the typical time period between the beginning and completion of training tends to vary between three and six months.

===Accidents===
Accidents, periodic episodes of urinary or fecal incontinence, are generally a normal part of toilet training and are usually not a sign of serious medical issues. Accidents that occur with additional problems, such as pain when urinating or defecating, chronic constipation, or blood in urine or feces, should be evaluated by a pediatrician. The prevalence of nocturnal enuresis, also known as bed wetting, may be as high as 9.7% of seven-year-olds, and 5.5% of ten-year-olds, eventually decreasing to a rate of about 0.5% in adults.

==Complications==

Toilet training can be increasingly difficult for parents of children who have certain developmental, behavioral or medical disorders. Children with autism, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may not be motivated to complete toilet training, may have difficulty appropriately responding to associated social reinforcements, or may have sensory sensitivities which make using the toilet unpleasant.

Children may have a range of physical issues related to the genitourinary system, that could require medical assessment and surgical or pharmacological intervention to ensure successful toilet training. Those with cerebral palsy may face a unique set of challenges related to bladder and bowel control, and those with visual or auditory problems may require adaptations in the parental approach to training to compensate, in addition to therapy or adaptive equipment.

Stool toileting refusal occurs when a child that has been toilet trained to urinate, refuses to use the toilet to defecate for a period lasting at least one month. This may affect as many as 22% of children and can result in constipation or pain during elimination. It usually resolves without the need for intervention. Children may exhibit stool withholding, or attempts to avoid defecation all together. This can also result in constipation. Some children will hide their stool, which may be done out of embarrassment or fear, and is more likely to be associated with both toileting refusal and withholding.

Although some complications may increase the time needed to achieve successful bladder and bowel control, most children can be toilet trained nonetheless. Physiological causes of failure in toilet training are rare, as is the need for medical intervention. In most cases, children who struggle with training are most likely not yet ready.

In a 2014 survey of UK schools, primary school teachers and educational staff reported observing an increasing number of otherwise healthy schoolchildren who were not toilet trained. 15% of respondents reported that they had observed healthy children aged 5-7 wearing diapers to school in the past year. 5% reported the same for children aged 7–11. A health worker with the Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust said that she knew of medically healthy adolescents as old as 15 with toilet training issues. Commentators attributed the issue to parents being too busy to teach their children basic skills.
===Risks===
An examination of data from hospital emergency rooms in the US from 2002 to 2010 indicated that the most common form of toilet training related injury was caused by falling toilet seats, and occurred most often in children aged two to three. The second most common injury was from slipping on floors, and 99% of injuries of all types occurred in the home.

In abusive homes, toilet training may be a trigger for child maltreatment, especially in circumstances where a parent or caregiver feels the child is old enough that they should have already successfully mastered training, and yet the child continues to have accidents. This may be misinterpreted by the caregiver as willful disobedience on the part of the child.

==Technologies and equipment==
As early as 1938, among the first technologies developed to address toilet training was known as the &quot;bell and pad&quot;, where a sensor detected when a child had wet themselves at night, and triggered an alarm to act as a form of conditioning. Similar alarm systems have been studied that sense wetness in undergarments, especially as it concerns the toilet training of those with intellectual disabilities. This has been applied more recently in the production of potties, that play an audible cheer or other form of encouragement when used by a child.

Trainers may choose to employ different choices of undergarments to facilitate training. This includes switching from traditional diapers or nappies to training pants (pull-ups), or the use of non-absorbent cotton underwear of the type adults may wear. These are typically employed later in the training process, and not as initial step. Children who experience repeated accidents after transitioning to cotton undergarments may be allowed to resume the use of diapers.

Most widely used techniques recommend the use of specialized children&#x27;s potties, and some recommend that parents consider using snacks or drinks as rewards.

<text>The Desjardins Group (, ) is a Canadian financial service cooperative and the largest federation of credit unions () in North America. It was founded in 1900 in Lévis, Quebec by Alphonse Desjardins. While its legal headquarters remains in Lévis, most of the executive management, including the CEO, is based in Montreal.

As of 2017, Desjardins Group consists of 293 local credit unions operating 1,032 points of service and serving more than seven million members and clients, mostly in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. Desjardins Group also operates the services of the former Canadian division of State Farm which was then acquired in 2015.

In addition to retail banking, the Group has over twenty subsidiaries offering products and services related to insurance (Desjardins Financial Security, Desjardins General Insurance), real estate (with its Complexe Desjardins offices in Montreal and Quebec online estate agent ), venture capital funds (Desjardins Venture Capital), and brokerage (Desjardins Securities). The Desjardins Group, through subsidiary Développement international Desjardins, is also active in over 30 developing countries through technical assistance programs and various investments. In October 2020, Desjardins launched a social impact fund, Aequitas, which could grow to 115 million dollars and help women and youth in developing countries.

==History==

After studying European credit institutions established in the 19th century, Alphonse Desjardins in 1901 came up with an original solution adapted to North America.

In the late 1990s, the number of &quot;caisses&quot; was reduced from 1275 to 800.

Between 2008 and 2010, total assets at Desjardins Group grew over 15% from Can$151.9 billion (when it ranked sixth in Canada and first in Quebec among financial institutions ahead of the National Bank of Canada) to over $175 billion in 2010. In 2006, it had 6,500 elected and volunteer officers and employed over 40,000 people and gave its members $483 million in patronage allocations and $64 million in donations, sponsorships and academic scholarships. Most of the latter sum was used on regional economic development and health programs as well. In that same year, in March 2008, the election of Monique Leroux at the head of the group marked the history of Canada by becoming &quot;Canada&#x27;s largest company headed by a woman&quot;.

In December 2010, it acquired the 121 offices and 500,000 customers of Western Financial for $443 million, giving it a presence in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.

In 2003, Desjardins bought the former Province of Ontario Savings Office, which it branded &quot;Desjardins Credit Union&quot; and operated until 2011. This institution was then merged into Meridian Credit Union. (The similarly named Desjardins Ontario Credit Union, formed 1 January 2020 with the merger of 11 Ontario Desjardins-affiliated credit unions and their federation into one, is not the same entity and continues as a going concern.)

In 2014, Desjardins Group acquired the Canadian operations of U.S.-based insurance giant State Farm. The policies were transferred to be underwritten by Desjardins Insurance on January 1, 2015. The State Farm brand continued to be used for agents and marketing until 2018.

On January 3, 2017, Desjardins Group announced the closing of the sale of its pet health insurance company, Western Financial Insurance Company to Economical Mutual Insurance Company. Western Financial Insurance Company and its flagship brand, Petsecure were purchased in 2011 as part of the Western Financial Group deal.

On July 5, 2017, Trimont Financial, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company, announced the completion of its purchase of the remainder of Western Financial Group from Desjardins Group for $775 million. Included in the sale were Western Financial Group&#x27;s Brokerage Network, Western Financial Group Insurance Solutions, and Western Life Assurance.

In 2018, State Farm Canada was officially rebranded to Desjardins Insurance through Desjardins Insurance Agents. The whole transition was to be completed by the end of 2019.

===2019 data breach===
On June 20, 2019, Desjardins Group reported a data breach involving personal data of 4.3 million individual users and 173,000 businesses, more than 40% of Quebec-based credit union&#x27;s clients and members. The security breach, detected in December 2018, was not linked to a direct cyberattack, but the result of a disgruntled corporate employee. The data leaked was assembled over a certain period of time after unauthorized access to banking systems and copied customer data. Police investigation is still ongoing.

==Credit agency ratings==
As of December 2018, Desjardins long-term debt is rated Aa2 by Moody&#x27;s, A+ by S&amp;P, AA by DBRS, and AA− by Fitch. S&amp;P and Fitch considered the company&#x27;s outlook &quot;stable,&quot; while Moody&#x27;s and DBRS rated it &quot;negative.&quot;

<text>Yibna (; &quot;Jabneh&quot; or &quot;Jabneel&quot; in Biblical times; &quot;Jamnia&quot; in Roman times; &quot;Ibelin&quot; to the Crusaders), or Tel Yavne, is an archaeological site and depopulated Palestinian town. The ruins are located southeast of the modern Israeli city of Yavne.

The town had a population of 5,420 in 1948, located 15 kilometers southwest of Ramla. Most of the population fled after the fall of al-Qubeiba and Zarnuqa in late May, but armed males were forced back. Israeli army took the town on June 5 and expelled the remaining population.

It is a significant site for post-biblical Jewish history, as it was the location of the Council of Jamnia, considered the birthplace of modern Rabbinic Judaism. It is also significant in the history of the Crusades, as the location of the House of Ibelin.

==Name==
In many English translations of the Bible, it is known as Yavne or Jabneh . In classical antiquity, it was known as Jamnia (; ); to the Crusaders as Ibelin; and before 1948, as Yibna. ()

==History==

Based on written sources and archaeology, the history of Yavneh/Jabneh/Yibna goes back to the Iron Age and possibly to the Bronze Age. The Hebrew Bible mentions Yavneh repeatedly, as does Josephus. For more see Yavne.

===Bronze and Iron Age===
Salvage excavations carried out in 2001 by the Israel Antiquities Authority uncovered several burials at the northern foot of the original tell. Most of the burials are dated to the later Iron Age. One burial points to a late Bronze Age occupation.

A large Philistine &quot;favissa&quot; (deposit of cultic artifacts) was discovered on Temple Hill. Two excavation seasons in the 2000s led by Professor Dan Bahat revealed some Iron Age remains. Pottery sherds of the Iron Age and Persian period were discovered at the surface of the tell.

====Roman period with Herodians====
In Roman times, the city was known as Iamnia, also spelled Jamnia. It was bequeathed by Herod the Great upon his death to his sister Salome I. Upon her death, it passed to the Roman emperor Augustus, who managed it as a private imperial estate, a status it was to maintain for at least a century. After Salome&#x27;s death, Iamnia came into the property of Livia, the future Roman empress, and then to her son Tiberius.

During the First Jewish–Roman War, when the Roman army had quelled the insurrection in Galilee, the army then marched upon Iamnia and Azotus, taking both towns and stationing garrisons within them. According to rabbinic tradition, the tanna Yohanan ben Zakkai and his disciples were permitted to settle in Iamnia during the outbreak of the war, after Zakkai, realizing that Jerusalem was about to fall, sneaked out of the city and asked Vespasian, the commander of the besieging Roman forces, for the right to settle in Yavne and teach his disciples. Upon the fall of Jerusalem, his school functioned as a re-establishment of the Sanhedrin.

===Byzantine period===

Byzantine period finds from excavations include an aqueduct east of the tell, and a kiln. The world&#x27;s largest wine factory from the Byzantine period has been uncovered by Israeli archaeologists, after a two-year excavation process; the importance of its wine was exemplified by its use by emperor Justin II in 566 at his table during his coronation feast.

===Early Islamic period===
The historian al-Baladhuri (d. 892 CE) mentioned Yibna as one of ten towns in Jund Filastin conquered by the Rashidun army led by Amr ibn al-As during the Muslim conquest of the Levant. The 9th-century historian Ya&#x27;qubi wrote that it was an ancient city built on a hill and inhabited by Samaritans.

The geographer al-Maqdisi, writing around 985, said that &quot;Yubna has a beautiful mosque. From this place come the excellent figs known by the name of Damascene.&quot; The geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi wrote that in Yubna there was a tomb said to be that of Abu Hurayra, a Companion of the Prophet. The author of the &quot;Marasid&quot; also adds that tomb seen here is also said to be that of Abd Allah ibn Sa&#x27;d, another Companion of the Prophet.

In 2007, remains ranging from the early Islamic period until the British Mandate period were uncovered. An additional kiln, and part of a commercial/industrial area were uncovered at the west of the tell in 2009.

===Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
The Crusaders called the city Ibelin and built a castle there in 1141. Two excavation seasons led by Professor Dan Bahat starting in 2005 revealed the main gate. Its namesake noble family, the house of Ibelin, was important in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and later in the Kingdom of Cyprus. Salvage excavations at the west of the tell unearthed a stash of 53 Crusader coins of the 12th and 13th centuries.

Ibelin was first sacked by Saladin before his army was comprehensively routed at the Battle of Montgisard in late 1177. In August 1187, it was retaken by Saladin and burned down, and ceased for some time to form part of the Crusaders&#x27; kingdom. The Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela (1130–1173) identified Jamnia (&quot;Jabneh&quot;) of classical writers with the &quot;Ibelin&quot; of the Crusades. He places the ancient city of Jamnia at three parasangs from Jaffa and two from Ashdod (&quot;Azotus&quot;).

During the Mamluk period (13th–16th centuries), Yibna was a key site along the Cairo—Damascus road, which served as a center for rural religious and economic life. Ibelin&#x27;s parish church was converted into a mosque, to which a minaret was added during the Mamluk period in 1337. The minaret survives until today, while the mosque (the former Crusader church) was blown up by the Israeli army in 1950.

The Mausoleum of Abu Huraira, a &quot;maqam&quot; (religious shrine), in Yibna was described as &quot;one of the finest domed mausoleums in Palestine&quot;. The site has been considered by Muslims as the tomb of Abu Huraira since the 12th century. After Israel&#x27;s capture of Yibna in 1948, the shrine was taken over by Sephardic Jews who consider the tomb as the burial place of Rabbi Gamaliel of Yavne.

===Ottoman period===
The village became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the 1596 Ottoman tax registers, it fell under the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Gaza, part of the &quot;liwa&#x27;&quot; (district) of Gaza, with a population of 129 households, an estimated 710 persons, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on a number of crops, including wheat, barley, summer crops, sesame seeds and fruits, as well as goats, beehives and vineyards; a total of 34,000 akçe. Three quarters of the revenues went to a waqf (religious endowment).

In the French campaign in Egypt and Syria in 1799, it was shown on the map that Pierre Jacotin compiled that year as &#x27;Ebneh&#x27;.

An American missionary, William Thomson, who visited Yibna in 1834, described it as a village on hill inhabited by 3,000 Muslims who worked in agriculture. He wrote that an inscription on the mosque indicated that it had been built in 1386, while Denys Pringle indicates 1337 as the construction year of the minaret. In 1838, Yibna was noted as a Muslim village in the Gaza district.

An Ottoman village list from 1870 found that Yibna had a population of 1,042 living in 348 houses, although this number only counted adult males. In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Yibna as a large village partly built of stone and situated on a hill. It had olive trees and corn to the north, and gardens nearby.

===British Mandate===

In 1921, an elementary school for boys was founded in Yibna. By 1941-42 it had 445 students. A school for girls was founded in 1943, and by 1948 it had 44 students.

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Yibna had a population of 1,791; all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 3,600, of whom all were Muslims except for seven Christians, two Jews and one Baháʼí, living in a total of 794 houses.

In 1941, Kibbutz Yavne was established nearby by refugees from Germany, followed by a Youth Aliyah village, Givat Washington, in 1946.

In 1944-45, Yibna had a population of 5,400 Muslims and 20 Christians, while the total land area was 59,554 dunams, according to an official land and population survey.
In addition there were 1,500 nomads living around the village. A total of 6,468 dunams of village land was used for citrus and bananas, 15,124 were used for cereals, 11,091 were irrigated or used for orchards, of which 25 were planted with olive trees, while 127 dunams were classified as built-up areas.

==1948 and aftermath==
Yibna was in the territory allotted to the Jewish state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. In mid-March 1948, a contingent of Iraqi volunteers moved into the village. In a Haganah reprisal on March 30, two dozen villagers were killed. On April 21, the Iraqi village commander was arrested by the British authorities for the drunken shooting of two Arabs.

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, residents of Zarnuqa sought refuge in Yibna, but left after Yibna&#x27;s inhabitants accused them of being traitors. On 27 May, following the fall of nearby al-Qubayba and Zarnuqa, most of the population of Yibna fled to Isdud, but Yibna&#x27;s armed males were forced back to Yibna by Isdud&#x27;s militiamen. According to the official history, the Israeli Givati Brigade was interested in evacuating the village. On June 5, after a brief firefight, they occupied the village and expelled the few old people who remained. Refugees fleeing the village were fired at &#x27;to increase [their] panic.&#x27;

After 1948, a number of Israeli villages were founded on Yibna&#x27;s land: Kfar HaNagid and Beit Gamliel in 1949, Ben Zakai in 1950, Kfar Aviv (originally: &quot;Kfar HaYeor&quot;) in 1951, and Tzofiyya in 1955.

Archaeological excavations have revealed that part of the pre-1948 Arab village at Yibna was built on top of a Byzantine-period cemetery and refuse pits.

==Cultural references==
Palestinian artist Sliman Mansour made Yibna the subject of one of his paintings. The work, named for the village, was one of a series of four on destroyed Palestinian villages that he produced in 1988 in order to resist the cancellation of Palestinian history; the others being Yalo, Imwas and Bayt Dajan.

==The harbour of Javneh==

The harbour of ancient Yavneh has been identified on the coast at Minet Rubin (Arabic) or Yavne-Yam (Hebrew), where excavations have revealed fortification going back to the Bronze Age Hyksos. It has been in use from the Middle Bronze Age until the 12th century CE, when it was abandoned.

On February 29, 2012, Heaton criticized Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke, who advocated in favor of a contraceptive mandate for health insurance plans. Heaton said on Twitter, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if anyone uses birth control – just don&#x27;t charge me for it&quot;, and wrote a series of tweets mocking Fluke&#x27;s activism, as well as retweeting similar remarks from her followers. After incurring criticism, Heaton apologized and deleted most of the posts.

===Other views===
In August 2006, Heaton&#x27;s name was in an advertisement in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that condemned Hamas and Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. In October 2023, Heaton was a vocal supporter of Israel during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, releasing a video in which she compared the conflict to the Holocaust during World War II, and encouraged her followers to donate through the Beth Jacob Congregation.

In October 2006, Heaton appeared in a commercial opposing a Missouri state constitutional amendment concerning embryonic stem cell research, which subsequently passed. The advertisement was a response to the election of Democratic Senate hopeful Claire McCaskill and aired at the same time as Michael J. Fox&#x27;s advertisement supporting the amendment. Appearing with Heaton were actor Jim Caviezel, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Jeff Suppan, Seattle Mariner Mike Sweeney, and St. Louis Rams/Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner. Following a public outcry, Heaton later said she regretted doing the ad and sent an apology to Fox, saying she was unaware of his ad. Fox accepted her apology and later stated, &quot;If we can have a healthy dialogue about issues that people see differently, that&#x27;s marvelous.&quot;

<text>Tussilago farfara, commonly known as coltsfoot, is a plant in the tribe Senecioneae in the family Asteraceae, native to Europe and parts of western and central Asia. The name &quot;tussilago&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;tussis&quot;, meaning cough, and &quot;ago&quot;, meaning to cast or to act on. It has had uses in traditional medicine, but the discovery of toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the plant has resulted in liver health concerns.

&quot;Tussilago farfara&quot; is the only accepted species in the genus Tussilago, although more than two dozen other species have at one time or another been considered part of this group. Most of them are now regarded as members of other genera (&quot;Chaptalia&quot;, &quot;Chevreulia&quot;, &quot;Farfugium&quot;, &quot;Homogyne&quot;, &quot;Leibnitzia&quot;, &quot;Petasites&quot;, &quot;Senecio&quot;).

==Description==
Coltsfoot is a perennial herbaceous plant that spreads by seeds and rhizomes. &quot;Tussilago&quot; is often found in colonies of dozens of plants. The flowers, which superficially resemble dandelions, bear scale-leaves on the long stems in early spring. The leaves of coltsfoot, which appear after the flowers have set seed, wither and die in the early summer. The flower heads are of yellow florets with an outer row of bracts. The plant is typically in height. The leaves have angular teeth on their margins.

==Distribution==
Coltsfoot is widespread across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, from Svalbard to Morocco to China and the Russian Far East. It is also a common plant in North and South America where it has been introduced, most likely by settlers as a medicinal item, or to provide early blooms for honeybees. The plant is often found in waste and disturbed places and along roadsides and paths. In some areas it is considered an invasive species.
==Name==
The common name comes from the leaf&#x27;s supposed resemblance in shape to a colt&#x27;s foot. It is a 16th-century translation of the medieval Latin name &quot;pes pulli&quot;, meaning &quot;foal&#x27;s foot&quot;. Other common names include tash plant, ass&#x27;s foot, bull&#x27;s foot, coughwort (Old English), farfara, foal&#x27;s foot, foalswort, and horse foot. Sometimes it is confused with &quot;Petasites frigidus&quot;, or western coltsfoot.

It has been called &quot;bechion&quot;, &quot;bechichie&quot;, or &quot;bechie&quot;, from the Ancient Greek word for &quot;cough&quot;. Also &quot;ungula caballina&quot; (&quot;horse hoof&quot;), and &quot;chamæleuce&quot;.

==Uses==
Coltsfoot has been used in herbal medicine and has been consumed as a food product with some confectionery products, such as Coltsfoot Rock. &quot;Tussilago farfara&quot; leaves have been used in traditional Austrian medicine internally (as tea or syrup) or externally (directly applied) for treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, skin, locomotor system, viral infections, flu, colds, fever, rheumatism and gout. An extract of the fresh leaves has also been used to make cough drops and hard candy.

Coltsfoot is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Gothic and small angle shades. It is also visited by honeybees, providing pollen and nectar.
==Toxicity==
&quot;Tussilago farfara&quot; contains tumorigenic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Senecionine and senkirkine, present in coltsfoot, have the highest mutagenetic activity of any pyrrolozidine alkaloid, tested using &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; to produce a comparative genotoxicity test.

Two cases of supposed liver damage (and death) due to coltsfoot tea have been shown to actually be the result of mistaken identity. In one, coltsfoot tea causing severe liver problems in an infant was actually the result of &quot;Adenostyles alliariae&quot; (alpendost). In another case, an infant developed liver disease and died because the mother drank tea originally believed to contain coltsfoot during her pregnancy, but which was later shown to be &quot;Petasites hybridus&quot; (butterbur) or a similar species. In one 27-year-old male, ingesting a multicomponent herbal supplement that included coltsfoot may have caused him to develop non-lethal deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

In response, the German government banned the sale of coltsfoot. Clonal plants of coltsfoot free of pyrrolizidine alkaloids were then developed in Austria and Germany. This has resulted in the development of the registered variety &quot;Tussilago farfara&quot; &#x27;Wien&#x27;, which has no detectable levels of these alkaloids.

<doc id="651093" wikidata="Q2581681" url="?curid=651093" title="This Side of Paradise">
<text>This Side of Paradise is a 1920 debut novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. It examines the lives and morality of carefree American youth at the dawn of the Jazz Age. Its protagonist, Amory Blaine, is a handsome middle-class student at Princeton University who dabbles in literature and engages in a series of unfulfilling romances with young women. The novel explores themes of love warped by greed and social ambition. Fitzgerald, who took inspiration for the title from a line in Rupert Brooke&#x27;s poem &quot;Tiare Tahiti&quot;, spent years revising the novel before Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons accepted it for publication.

Following its publication in March 1920, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; became a sensation in the United States, and reviewers hailed it as an outstanding debut novel. The book went through twelve printings and sold 49,075 copies. Although the book neither became one of the ten best-selling novels of the year nor made him wealthy, F. Scott Fitzgerald became a household name overnight. His newfound fame enabled him to earn higher rates for his short stories, and his improved financial prospects persuaded his fiancée Zelda Sayre to marry him. His novel became especially popular among young Americans, and the press depicted its 23-year-old author as the standard-bearer for &quot;youth in revolt&quot;.

Although Fitzgerald wrote the novel about the youth culture of 1910s America, the work became popularly and inaccurately associated with the carefree social milieu of post-war 1920s America, and social commentators touted Fitzgerald as the first writer to turn the national spotlight on the younger Jazz Age generation, particularly their flappers. In contrast to the older Lost Generation to which Gertrude Stein posited that Ernest Hemingway and Fitzgerald belonged, the Jazz Age generation were younger Americans who had been adolescents during World War I and mostly untouched by the conflict&#x27;s horrors. Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel riveted the nation&#x27;s attention on the leisure activities of this hedonistic younger generation and sparked debate over their perceived immorality.

The novel created the widespread perception of Fitzgerald as a libertine chronicler of rebellious youth and proselytizer of Jazz Age hedonism which led reactionary societal figures to denounce the author and his work. These detractors regarded him as the outstanding aggressor in the rebellion of &quot;flaming youth&quot; against the traditional values of the &quot;old guard&quot;. When Fitzgerald died in 1940, many social conservatives rejoiced. Due to this perception of Fitzgerald and his works, the Baltimore Diocese refused his family permission to bury him at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Rockville, Maryland.

== Plot summary ==
Amory Blaine, a young Midwesterner, believes that he has a great destiny, but the precise nature of this destiny eludes him. He attends a preparatory school where he becomes a football quarterback. He grows estranged from his eccentric mother Beatrice Blaine and becomes the protégé of Monsignor Thayer Darcy, a Catholic priest. During his sophomore year at Princeton, he returns to Minneapolis over Christmas break and falls in love with Isabelle Borgé, a wealthy debutante whom he first met as a boy. Amory and Isabelle embark upon a romance.

While at Princeton, Amory deluges Isabelle with letters, but she becomes disenchanted with him due to his criticism, and they break up on Long Island. Following their separation, Amory accompanies a Princeton classmate to an apartment occupied by two New York showgirls of easy virtue. He considers staying the night with the showgirls, but his conscience and an apparition compel him to leave. After four years at Princeton, he enlists in the United States Army amid World War I. He ships overseas to serve in the muddy trenches of the Western front. While overseas, his mother Beatrice dies, and most of his family&#x27;s wealth disappears due to a series of failed investments.

After the armistice with Imperial Germany in November 1918, Amory settles in New York City amid the flowering of the Jazz Age. Rebounding from Isabelle, he becomes infatuated with Rosalind Connage, a cruel and narcissistic flapper. Desperate for a job, Amory obtains employment with an advertising agency but detests the work. His relationship with Rosalind deteriorates as she prefers a rival suitor, Dawson Ryder, a man of wealth and status. Rejected by Rosalind due to his lack of financial prospects, Amory quits his advertising job and goes on a drinking binge until the start of prohibition in the United States.

When Amory travels to visit an uncle in Maryland, he meets Eleanor Savage, a beautiful and reckless atheist. Eleanor chafes under the religious conformity and gender limitations imposed on her by contemporary society in Wilsonian America. Amory and Eleanor spend a lazy summer conversing about love. On their final night together before Amory returns to New York City, Eleanor attempts suicide by riding her horse over a cliff in order to prove her disbelief in any deity. At the last moment, she leaps to safety as her horse plummets over the precipice, and Amory realizes that he does not love her.

Returning to New York City, Amory learns of Rosalind&#x27;s engagement to his wealthy rival Dawson Ryder, and he declares that Rosalind is now dead to him. The death of his beloved mentor, Monsignor Darcy, further dispirits him. Homeless, Amory wanders from New York City to his alma mater Princeton. Accepting a car ride from a wealthy upper-class man driven by his working-class chauffeur in a Locomobile, Amory speaks out in favor of socialism in the United States—although he admits he is still formulating his thoughts as he is talking.

While riding in the Locomobile, Amory continues his argument about their time&#x27;s societal ills and articulates his disillusionment with the current historical era. He announces his hope to stand alongside those in the younger generation and to bring forth a new age in America. Both the upper-class and working-class men in the car denounce his views, but when Amory discovers that the upper-class man is the father of a Princeton classmate who died in World War I, they reconcile. Amory parts ways with his travel companions, and the upper-class man tells him: &quot;Good luck to you and bad luck to your theories.&quot;

As he approaches Princeton, Amory recognizes his selfishness as well as his overindulgence in drink and beauty. He realizes that he must transcend these flaws to become a better man. Wandering through a graveyard at twilight, he reflects upon his inevitable mortality and finds solace in the fact that future generations may one day ponder his life. He thinks of the next generation—inheriting disillusionment and a loss of faith, yet still chasing love and success. After midnight, he stands alone gazing at Princeton&#x27;s gothic towers and feels a newfound freedom. He stretches out his arms and proclaims, &quot;I know myself . . . but that is all.&quot;

== Major characters ==

Fitzgerald based most of the novel&#x27;s characters on persons from his life, although he often created composites and imbued his female characters with his own personality traits and thoughts.

* Amory Blaine a handsome and egocentric Princeton student from the Midwest and later a World War I veteran who has a series of unfulfilling romances with young women. Fitzgerald based the character on an idealized version of himself and his disappointing romantic relationships. The name &quot;Amory&quot; derives from Fitzgerald&#x27;s football hero at Princeton, Hobart Amory Baker.
* Isabelle Borgéa wealthy and shallow debutante who is Amory&#x27;s first love. Ginevra King, a socialite upon whom Fitzgerald developed a life-long romantic obsession, inspired the character. Like Amory and Isabelle, an 18-year-old Fitzgerald fell in love with a 16-year-old King on Christmas break in Saint Paul, Minnesota, during his sophomore year at Princeton, and their relationship ended in a similar fashion. Rumors circulated that Ginevra had kissed dozens of boys, all of whom fell in love with her. &quot;I was too thoughtless in those days,&quot; Ginevra recalled, &quot;and too much in love with love to think of consequences.&quot; Until his death, Fitzgerald remained forever in love with King and &quot;could not think of her without tears coming to his eyes&quot;.
* Rosalind Connagea cruel and selfish flapper whom Amory romances. Fitzgerald based Rosalind on 18-year-old Zelda Sayre and, to a lesser extent, on the fictional character of Beatrice Normandy in H. G. Wells&#x27; 1909 novel &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot;. Mirroring Rosalind&#x27;s materialistic relationship with Amory, Sayre ended her engagement with Fitzgerald due to his inability to support her privileged lifestyle as an idle Southern belle of Montgomery&#x27;s country club set. She resumed their engagement on the condition that he would provide her with luxury.
* Eleanor Savagea beautiful and reckless atheist whom Amory meets in Maryland. Fitzgerald partly based Eleanor on a purported love of his mentor Father Sigourney Fay, and, to a lesser extent, on 18-year-old Elizabeth Beckwith MacKie, a romantic interest he briefly knew. MacKie commented that the character &quot;reminded me of how little he really knew me. His Eleanor loved to sit on a haystack in the rain reciting poetry. Forgive me, Scott: if that is the way you wanted it, then you missed the whole idea of what can happen atop a haystack.&quot; 
* Thayer Darcya jovial and impious Catholic priest who serves as Amory&#x27;s spiritual mentor. Father Sigourney Fay, a possibly gay Catholic priest with whom Fitzgerald had an intimate and ambiguous relationship, inspired the character. While writing &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, Fitzgerald quoted verbatim entire letters sent to him by Fay. In addition to using Fay&#x27;s private correspondence, Fitzgerald drew on anecdotes that Fay had told him in confidence about his personal life, including his purported failed romances with women. When reading &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, Fay wrote to Fitzgerald that the unapproved use of these experiences told in confidence to the author &quot;gave him a queer feeling.&quot;
* Beatrice Blainean aging and eccentric matron who is Amory&#x27;s mother. Based on the mother of one of Fitzgerald&#x27;s friends.
* Clara Pagea widowed older cousin for whom Amory has unrequited affection. Based on Fitzgerald&#x27;s cousin Cecilia Delihant Taylor.
* Cecelia ConnageRosalind&#x27;s cynical younger sister who steals cigarettes and envies her sibling&#x27;s popularity among young men.
* Allenbya heroic football captain at Princeton based on Hobey Baker. The national press praised Baker as one of the greatest athletes of his time, and he embodied everything Fitzgerald aspired to be as a Princeton undergraduate. He described Baker as &quot;an ideal worthy of everything in my enthusiastic admiration, yet consummated and expressed in a human being who stood within ten feet of me.&quot; After graduating from Princeton in 1914, Baker enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Service amid World War I and died in a plane crash in December 1918.
* Thomas Parke D&#x27;Invilliersa bespectacled and high-brow Princeton classmate who has a gift for poetry. Fitzgerald based D&#x27;Invilliers on his Princeton friend, poet John Peale Bishop. D&#x27;Invilliers becomes Amory&#x27;s close friend and confidante in various subjects, among which are literature, love for young beauties, politics, and the meaning of the self. He becomes a journalist, developing his own perspectives apart from those he shares with Amory. The character reappears as a fictitious poet quoted on the title page of Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.

== Background and composition ==
=== Love, war, and novel ambitions ===

Since childhood, F. Scott Fitzgerald aspired to become a famous novelist. &quot;Three months before I was born,&quot; Scott later wrote, &quot;my mother lost her other two children... I think I started then to be a writer.&quot; While attending Princeton University, his passion for writing literature began to solidify into a career choice, and he wrote fiction as an undergraduate for the Princeton Triangle Club, the &quot;Princeton Tiger&quot;, and the &quot;Nassau Literary Review&quot;.

During his sophomore year at Princeton, Fitzgerald returned home to Saint Paul, Minnesota during Christmas break where the 18-year-old aspiring writer fell in love with 16-year-old Chicago debutante Ginevra King. They began a passionate romantic relationship spanning several years. Although Ginevra loved him, her upper-class family belittled Scott&#x27;s courtship because of his lower-class status compared to her other wealthy suitors. Rejected by Ginevra as a suitable match, Fitzgerald enlisted in the United States Army amid World War I.

In November 1917, hoping to have a novel published before his deployment to Europe and his anticipated death in the trenches of World War I, Fitzgerald began writing a 120,000-word manuscript titled &quot;The Romantic Egotist&quot;. Having never before undertaken a novel, he relied upon H. G. Wells&#x27; 1909 novel &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot; and Sir Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s 1913 novel &quot;Sinister Street&quot; as his literary templates. He sought to write the story of America&#x27;s younger generation from the perspective of himself as a conscious observer. After obtaining a brief leave from the army in February 1918, Fitzgerald continued work on his unpublished manuscript at the University Cottage Club&#x27;s library in Princeton. Eighty-one pages of this revised manuscript appeared in the final version of &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;.

In March 1918, Fitzgerald gave the revised manuscript to his acquaintance, Anglo-Irish journalist Shane Leslie, to deliver to Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons in New York City. Fitzgerald had met Leslie when the journalist visited America and toured the Newman School in New Jersey. After proofreading &quot;The Romantic Egotist&quot;, Leslie asked Scribner&#x27;s to retain the manuscript no matter what they thought of it. He proclaimed that Fitzgerald, upon his presumed death in the trenches, would become the next Rupert Brooke, a posthumously famous poet killed during World War I. &quot;Though Scott Fitzgerald is still alive it has a literary value,&quot; Leslie wrote to Scribner&#x27;s on May 6, 1918, &quot;Of course when he is killed, it will also have a commercial value.&quot; 

Upon reading Fitzgerald&#x27;s draft of &quot;The Romantic Egotist&quot;, Scribner&#x27;s editor Max Perkins urged his superiors to publish the manuscript, but senior editors Edward L. Burlingame and William C. Brownell disagreed with him regarding its quality and instructed him to reject the work. In an August 19, 1918 letter to Fitzgerald, Perkins turned down the manuscript but praised the writer&#x27;s talent. Although he had been instructed to reject the work, Perkins provided detailed guidance on how to revise it, suggesting that Fitzgerald add more significance and details about Amory&#x27;s &quot;affairs with girls.&quot; Perkins encouraged Fitzgerald to resubmit the manuscript after making these revisions.

By June 1918, Fitzgerald served with the 45th and 67th Infantry Regiments at Camp Sheridan near Montgomery, Alabama. Attempting to rebound from Ginevra&#x27;s rejection, a lonely Fitzgerald began courting young women, including Zelda Sayre, an idle Southern belle, who reminded him of Ginevra. At their first meeting, Fitzgerald told Zelda that she reminded him of Isabelle, the free-spirited character based on Ginevra in his unpublished manuscript. After sharing his ambitions, Zelda dismissed Fitzgerald&#x27;s remarks as mere boastfulness and concluded that he would never become a famous writer. A romance blossomed, although Fitzgerald continued secretly writing to Ginevra, hoping in vain for a chance to resume their relationship. Three days after Ginevra&#x27;s arranged marriage to a wealthy Chicago polo player, a heartbroken Fitzgerald professed his affection for Zelda in September 1918. In October 1918, Fitzgerald submitted a revised version of &quot;The Romantic Egoist&quot; to Scribner&#x27;s, but the publisher rejected the work a second time, and he captioned their telegram in his scrapbook: &quot;.&quot;

=== Despair and manuscript revisions ===
After his army discharge in February 1919, Fitzgerald moved to New York City amid the onset of the Jazz Age. While seeking a breakthrough as an author of fiction, he turned to writing advertising copy for Barron Collier to sustain himself but the vacuity of the work irritated him. &quot;Advertising is a racket, like the movies and the brokerage business,&quot; Fitzgerald complained. &quot;You cannot be honest without admitting that its constructive contribution to humanity is exactly minus zero.&quot; Although Fitzgerald had not intended to marry Zelda in December 1918, he changed his mind over the next three months, and the two became engaged by March 1919. As time passed, Fitzgerald continued living in poverty in New York City, and he could not convince Zelda that he could support her affluent lifestyle. She broke off their engagement in June.

In the wake of Ginevra rejecting Fitzgerald two years prior, Zelda&#x27;s rejection further dispirited him. Unable to earn a successful living, Fitzgerald carried a revolver while contemplating suicide, and he threatened to jump to his death from a window ledge of the Yale Club. According to biographer Andrew Turnbull, &quot;one day, drinking martinis in the upstairs lounge, [Fitzgerald] announced that he was going to jump out of the window. No one objected; on the contrary, it was pointed out that the windows were French and ideally suited for jumping, which seemed to cool his ardor.&quot; Despite Zelda&#x27;s rejection, Fitzgerald hoped that his success as an author might change her mind, and he told a friend, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t care if she died, but I couldn&#x27;t stand to have anybody else marry her.&quot;

In July 1919, Fitzgerald quit his advertising job and returned to St. Paul. Returning to his hometown as a failure, Fitzgerald became a recluse and lived on the top floor of his parents&#x27; home at 599 Summit Avenue. He decided to make one last attempt to become a novelist and to stake everything on the success or failure of a book. Abstaining from alcohol, he worked day and night to revise &quot;The Romantic Egotist&quot; as &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;—an autobiographical account of his Princeton years and his romances with Ginevra King, Zelda Sayre, and other young women. Fitzgerald chose the new title based on a line in Rupert Brooke&#x27;s poem &quot;Tiare Tahiti&quot;, &quot;Well this side of Paradise!... There&#x27;s little comfort in the wise.&quot;

While revising the manuscript, Fitzgerald drew upon the correspondence of friends and acquaintances. He quoted verbatim three letters and one poem by Father Sigourney Fay, a possibly gay Catholic priest with whom Fitzgerald had a close relationship. He also used a quote from Zelda&#x27;s letters for a soliloquy by the narrator in the final pages. Zelda had written a letter eulogizing the Confederate soldiers who died during the American Civil War. &quot;I&#x27;ve spent today in the graveyard,&quot; she wrote to Scott, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it funny how, out of a row of Confederate soldiers, two or three will make you think of dead lovers and dead loves—when they&#x27;re exactly like the others, even to the yellowish moss.&quot; In the novel&#x27;s final pages, Fitzgerald altered Zelda&#x27;s neo-Confederate sentiments to refer to Union soldiers instead of Confederates.
Fitzgerald sent the revised manuscript to Scribner&#x27;s on September 4, 1919. Although the manuscript again impressed Perkins who wished to publish the novel, senior executives at the publishing house again disagreed with Perkins and disliked the novel on the grounds of indecency. At the monthly meeting of Scribner&#x27;s editorial board, an elderly Charles Scribner II, the president of the company, grumbled that Fitzgerald&#x27;s work lacked &quot;literary merit,&quot; and senior editor William C. Brownell dismissed it as &quot;frivolous.&quot;

As the lone voice supporting the publication of Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel at the editorial board meeting, a frustrated Perkins threatened to resign unless the company agreed to publish it. &quot;My feeling is that a publisher&#x27;s first allegiance is to talent. And if we aren&#x27;t going to publish a talent like this, it is a very serious thing,&quot; Perkins declared at the meeting. &quot;If we&#x27;re going to turn down the likes of Fitzgerald, I will lose all interest in publishing books.&quot; Despite the fact that Fitzgerald&#x27;s manuscript repelled older employees at Scribner&#x27;s, the executives relented out of fear of losing Perkins as a gifted editor and literary talent scout.

On September 16, eight days before Fitzgerald&#x27;s 23rd birthday, Scribner&#x27;s accepted the novel for publication. Now able to express their opinions, lower-ranking editors at Scribner&#x27;s opined that they believed Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel represented the &quot;voice of a new age&quot;. Soon after Scribner&#x27;s decision, Perkins wrote a congratulatory letter to Fitzgerald: &quot;I am very glad, personally, to be able to write to you that we are all for publishing your book &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;... I think that you have improved it enormously... The book is so different that it is hard to prophesy how it will sell but we are all for taking a chance and supporting it with vigor.&quot;

=== Publication and meteoric success ===

Upon receiving Perkin&#x27;s letter and learning of his first novel&#x27;s impending publication, Fitzgerald became euphoric. &quot;The postman rang, and that day I quit work and ran along the streets, stopping automobiles to tell friends and acquaintances about it⁠—my novel &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; was accepted for publication,&quot; he recalled, &quot;I paid off my terrible small debts, bought a suit, and woke up every morning with a world of ineffable top-loftiness and promise.&quot; After Scott informed Zelda of his novel&#x27;s upcoming publication, a shocked Zelda replied contritely: &quot;I hate to say this, but I don&#x27;t think I had much confidence in you at first... It&#x27;s so nice to know you really &quot;can&quot; do things&quot;. 

&quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; debuted on March 26, 1920, with a dust jacket illustrated by W. E. Hill. Advertised in newspapers with the slogan, &quot;A Novel About Flappers Written For Philosophers,&quot; the initial printing of 3,000 copies sold out in three days. Although not among the ten best-selling novels of the year, the 23-year-old F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s first novel proved to be his most popular work and became a cultural sensation across the United States, making him a household name. The book went through twelve printings in 1920 and 1921, totaling 49,075 copies. Despite this success, the novel provided only modest income for Fitzgerald. Copies sold for $1.75 (), and he earned 10% on the first 5,000 copies and 15% thereafter, totaling $6,200 in 1920 ().

Although Fitzgerald complained to his friend Burton Rascoe that &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; didn&#x27;t make him wealthy, his new fame enabled him to earn much higher rates for his short stories, and Zelda resumed their engagement as he could now afford her privileged lifestyle. By the time of their wedding in April 1920, Fitzgerald claimed neither he nor Zelda still loved each other, and the early years of their marriage proved a disappointment. Despite his disappointing marriage, Fitzgerald had achieved the peak of his fame and cultural salience, and he recalled traveling in a taxi one afternoon through the streets of New York City and weeping when he realized he that he would never be as happy again.

== Reception ==
=== Cultural sensation ===
Upon its publication, Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; caused a cultural sensation that sparked societal debate, and overnight, he became a national figure. He riveted the public&#x27;s attention on the promiscuous activities of their sons and daughters cavorting in the rumble seats of Bearcat roadsters and prompted a national conversation over the perceived immorality of this hedonistic younger generation. Despite the fact that Fitzgerald had composed the work several years earlier and his novel chronicled the more restrained social milieu of pre-war 1910s America, the work became popularly and inaccurately associated with the wild carefree atmosphere of post-war 1920s America immortalized in John Held, Jr.&#x27;s satirical drawings.

With this debut novel, critics touted Fitzgerald as the first writer to turn the national spotlight on the Jazz Age generation, especially their young flappers. In contrast to the older Lost Generation to which Gertrude Stein posited that Ernest Hemingway and Fitzgerald belonged, the Jazz Age generation were those Americans younger than Fitzgerald who had been adolescents during World War I and largely untouched by the conflict. Fitzgerald described this younger generation as the true &quot;lost&quot; generation which shouldered his generational contemporaries out of the way: &quot;This was the generation whose girls dramatized themselves as flappers&quot;.

Due to its focus on liberated flappers and college life, Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel became a cultural phenomenon among young Americans. According to writer John O&#x27;Hara, half a million young men and women &quot;fell in love with the book,&quot; and, according to essayist Glenway Wescott, Fitgerald&#x27;s novel became the rallying banner of the &quot;youth movement&quot;. The novel&#x27;s immense popularity among American youth stemmed from its frank portrayal of their chafing under the outdated social mores of Wilsonian America. Although earlier works about collegiate life had been published such as Owen Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Stover at Yale&quot; (1912), Fitzgerald&#x27;s work became heralded as &quot;the first realistic American college novel&quot;, and young American men viewed the novel as a guide for social conduct. Newspapers reported that young American women imitated the rebellious behavior of the novel&#x27;s women characters, and some writers miscredited Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel with creating the cultural archetype of the flapper.

With his photograph appearing in many newspapers, the national press depicted Fitzgerald as the standard-bearer for &quot;youth in revolt&quot;. &quot;&#x27;Behold a new prophet is risen, who speaketh for Youth in Revolt!&quot; wrote &quot;The Montgomery Advertiser&quot;, describing the reaction to Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel. &quot;All things formerly held to be beautiful, good and true are now become futile, fatuous and fabulous, and worthy of respect no more. The bob-haired girl and the mop topped boy shall teach you the Facts of Life. Go to, ye elders, hearken unto them!&#x27;&quot; Such articles fostered the widespread impression of Fitzgerald as championing the revolt by young Americans against traditional norms and as the outstanding aggressor in the rebellion of &quot;flaming youth&quot; against the &quot;old guard&quot;.

Capitalizing on his new standing as a celebrated author with his finger on the pulse of young America, Fitzgerald gave interviews discoursing on youth culture. Declaring that World War I &quot;had little or nothing to do&quot; with the change in morals among young Americans and did not leave &quot;any real lasting effect,&quot; Fitzgerald attributed the sexual revolution among youth to a combination of popular literature by H. G. Wells and other intellectuals criticizing repressive social norms, Sigmund Freud&#x27;s sexual theories gaining salience, and the invention of the automobile allowing youths to escape parental surveillance in order to engage in premarital sex.

As a result of Fitzgerald&#x27;s new fame as a celebrated author chronicling young Americans defiance towards traditional values, social conservatives attacked the author in newspaper columns. Heywood Broun decried Fitzgerald&#x27;s use of modern slang and attempted to discredit him by claiming the author fabricated his novel&#x27;s depiction of young people engaging in drunken sprees and premarital sex. An amused Fitzgerald ridiculed such allegations, and he opined that such critics wished to discredit his work in order to retain their outdated conceptions of American society.

=== Critical reaction ===

The majority of critics lauded Fitzgerald&#x27;s debut novel with &quot;wild enthusiasm&quot;, and the most enthusiastic reviewers went so far as to hail the young Midwestern writer as a literary genius. In his April 1920 review, critic Burton Rascoe of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; urged his readers to &quot;make a note of the name, F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is borne by a 23 year old novelist who will, unless I am much mistaken, be much heard of hereafter.&quot; Rascoe asserted that Fitzgerald&#x27;s first novel bore &quot;the impress, it seems to me, of genius. It is the only adequate study that we have had of the contemporary American in adolescence and young manhood.&quot; 

&quot;The prize first novel of a decade is F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;,&quot; critic Fanny Butcher raved in her June 1920 column for &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, singling out Fitzgerald for particular praise amid other competitors that included the U.S. publication of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s first novel &quot;The Voyage Out&quot; and Zane Grey&#x27;s novel &quot;A Man for the Ages&quot;. Butcher declared Fitzgerald&#x27;s book to be &quot;the living, palpitant being of the youth of the hour, a book which, I haven&#x27;t a doubt in the world, will have a serious and far reaching effect on American literature.&quot; 

Perhaps the most influential review of Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel came from critic H. L. Mencken, the acerbic editor of the influential literary magazine &quot;The Smart Set&quot;. Mencken&#x27;s authoritative opinions on the latest literary endeavors often lifted their authors upward toward greater success or cast them down into cultural oblivion. In his August 1920 review of &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, Mencken described Fitzgerald&#x27;s work as an amazing debut and lavished praise on its author:

Mencken declared the first half of &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; to be superior to the second half, perceiving that Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel became more &quot;thin&quot; as the young author followed less autobiographical plot strands. Fitzgerald concurred with Mencken&#x27;s low opinion of certain later chapters, particularly Amory&#x27;s relations with Eleanor. In his annotated copy of &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, Fitzgerald deemed his Eleanor subplot to be unintentionally hilarious and admitted he could not &quot;even bear to read it.&quot; Believing that Fitzgerald&#x27;s protagonist began to elude the author in the second half, Mencken criticized Fitzgerald for dropping &quot;his Amory Blaine as Mark Twain dropped Huckleberry Finn, but for a less cogent reason.&quot; Despite this critique, he commended most of the novel, particularly up to and including the section detailing the love story with Rosalind.

Whereas some critics praised the novel&#x27;s form and structure as highly original, others criticized the work for the same reasons. Lillian C. Ford in &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; complained &quot;the construction is odd and the book has two parts, the first with four chapters and the second with five. The chapters have unexpected topical divisions and when the author feels so inclined he throws his story into drama form and then again it jogs along as plain narrative.&quot; Similarly, many reviewers commented that Fitzgerald&#x27;s structural craftsmanship left much to be desired. He could write entertainingly, they conceded, but he paid scant attention to form and construction. Having read these criticisms of his debut novel, Fitzgerald sought to improve on his form and construction in his next work, &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot;, and to venture into a new genre of fiction altogether.

=== Princeton backlash ===

Despite the novel&#x27;s warm reception by critics and readers, many of Princeton University&#x27;s faculty and alumni reacted with hostility towards Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, much to Fitzgerald&#x27;s surprise and dismay. Although Fitzgerald&#x27;s mentor Christian Gauss, a Professor of French Literature, lauded the novel as &quot;a work of art,&quot; other Princetonians attacked the book in the pages of the &quot;Princeton Alumni Weekly&quot; and &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;. They despised his popular novel for fostering an unfavorable impression of their school as a snobbish milieu focused on idle pleasures. In a typical review, Ralph Kent, a senior editor of the &quot;Nassau Literary Review&quot;, disparaged the work as impugning Princeton&#x27;s reputation due to its superficial depiction of undergraduate life.

Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel soon attracted the attention and displeasure of John Grier Hibben, a Presbyterian minister and educational reformer who succeeded Woodrow Wilson as the president of Princeton University. In a private letter to Fitzgerald dated May 27, 1920, Hibben expressed his profound disappointment with Fitzgerald&#x27;s depiction of the school and informed the young author that his novel had wounded him:

In response to Hibben&#x27;s chastising letter, Fitzgerald wrote a respectful but uncompromising reply that denied any attempt to disparage Princeton and defended his novel&#x27;s depiction of the university. &quot;I have no fault to find with Princeton that I can&#x27;t find with Oxford and Cambridge,&quot; Fitzgerald explained. &quot;I simply wrote out of my own impressions, wrote as honestly as I could a picture of its beauty. That the picture is cynical is the fault of my temperament... I must admit however that &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; does over accentuate the gaiety and country club atmosphere of Princeton. For the sake of the readers interest that part was much over-stressed, and of course the hero, not being average, reacted rather unhealthily I suppose to many perfectly normal phenomena. To that extent the book is inaccurate.&quot;

As a result of this unexpected backlash by the faculty and alumni, Fitzgerald&#x27;s joy at becoming a famous novelist proved short-lived. Although undergraduates across the country touted the novel as a realistic portrayal of college life, Princeton alumni and former classmates continued to treat the author with contempt in social settings over the ensuing months. In one instance, Fitzgerald visited Princeton&#x27;s University Cottage Club and faced a room full of alumni and former classmates who condemned him for tarnishing their school&#x27;s reputation. After informing Fitzgerald that he had been suspended from the club, they symbolically ejected him from the building via a rear window. Exasperated by the contemptuousness and sanctimoniousness of Princeton&#x27;s faculty and alumni, a dispirited Fitzgerald did not return to visit his alma mater for many years, presumably until their hostility had lessened.
After a 44-year-old Fitzgerald died of a heart attack due to occlusive coronary arteriosclerosis in December 1940, many Princeton staff and alumni continued to privately and publicly belittle the author and his literary &quot;oeuvre&quot;. According to biographer Scott Donaldson, after Fitzgerald&#x27;s death, his widow Zelda Fitzgerald attempted to sell the entirety of her late husband&#x27;s papers to Princeton University for the modest sum of $3,750 (), but the Princeton librarian spurned the offer. The Princeton librarian explained that the university felt no obligation to pay such a sum for the papers of a mediocre author who had been fortunate enough to attend their prestigious institution.

One year later, in 1941, literary critic Edmund Wilson, a close friend of Fitzgerald and a fellow Princetonian, attempted to use his considerable influence to persuade the university to publish a book honoring F. Scott Fitzgerald but proved unsuccessful. In 1956, when the Princeton University Library released a collection of Fitzgerald&#x27;s writings titled &quot;Afternoon of an Author&quot;, many alumni wrote letters of complaint arguing that Princeton should neither celebrate its connection to the author nor describe him as &quot;most Princetonian.&quot;

== Critical analysis ==
=== Contemporary analysis ===
==== Innovative style ====

For his first novel, Fitzgerald used as his literary templates H. G. Wells&#x27; 1909 realist work &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot; and Sir Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s 1913 novel &quot;Sinister Street&quot;, which chronicles a college student&#x27;s coming of age at Oxford University. The influence of these two particular novels upon &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; proved apparent to perceptive readers such as Fitzgerald&#x27;s friend Edmund Wilson who, upon finishing the novel, described Fitzgerald&#x27;s work as &quot;an exquisite burlesque of Compton Mackenzie with a pastiche of Wells thrown in at the end.&quot;

Although Fitzgerald imitated these novels, his debut work differed due to its experimental style. He discarded the traditional narrative of most novels and instead unspooled the plot in the form of intermingled textual fragments, letters, and poetry, even incorporating a stream-of-consciousness passage. This approach resulted from combining &quot;The Romantic Egotist&quot;, his earlier novel attempt, with various short stories and poems he had written but never published. 

This atonal blend of different fictive elements prompted critics to fête Fitzgerald as a trailblazer whose work modernized a staid literature that had fallen &quot;as far behind modern habits as behind modern history.&quot; &quot;&quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; may not seem like much now,&quot; writer Dorothy Parker attested decades later, &quot;but in 1920 it was considered an experimental novel; it cut new ground.&quot;

==== Prose anomalies ====
More so than most contemporary writers of his era, Fitzgerald&#x27;s authorial voice evolved and matured over time, and each of his novels represented a discernible progression in literary quality. Although he was eventually regarded as possessing &quot;the best narrative gift of the century,&quot; this narrative gift was not perceived as evident in &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;. Believing that prose had a basis in lyric verse, Fitzgerald crafted his sentences by ear and, consequently, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; contains numerous malapropisms and descriptive non sequiturs which annoyed readers and reviewers. Reflecting on these copious defects, critic Edmund Wilson remarked that Fitzgerald&#x27;s first novel exhibited nearly every possible fault and weakness a novel can possess.

=== Posthumous analysis ===

In more recent years, the underlying themes of narcissism and feminism in the novel have been examined in a variety of scholarly essays. Scholar Saori Tanaka&#x27;s argues that &quot;Amory comes to know himself through Beatrice and his four lovers, which are like five sheets of glass. They are his reflectors... reflecting his narcissism and the inner side.&quot;

The first three women in the book allow Amory to dream in a narcissistic way. After participating in the war and losing his financial foundation, the last two women he meets, Rosalind and Eleanor, &quot;make him not dream but awake&quot; in postwar America. &quot;With Beatrice and Isabelle, Amory activates the grandiose self,&quot; Tanaka states, &quot;with Clara and Rosalind, he restricts narcissism, and with Eleanor, he gains a realistic conception of the self.&quot;

Others have analyzed feminist themes in the work. Scholar Andrew Riccardo views several characters to be feminist templates. Eleanor&#x27;s character serves as a &quot;love interest, therapeutic friend, and conversational other&quot;. Highly educated in discussing poetry and philosophy, &quot;Eleanor not only posits her desires in juxtaposition to the lingering expectations of women in her day but also serves as soothsayer to the demands which would be placed on females&quot;.

== Legacy and influence ==

As an experimental novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; influenced the next generation of upcoming American writers, and critics such as John V. A. Weaver likened Fitzgerald&#x27;s impact on post-war American literature to Victor Hugo&#x27;s vast influence on French letters. Within two years, in the wake of young imitators writing in more experimental styles and discarding the traditional story structure, Weaver declared Fitzgerald&#x27;s influence on younger writers to be so great as to be inestimable. In her memoir &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;, Gertrude Stein wrote that Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel created this new generation of young writers in the public&#x27;s mind.

In addition to its literary influence on young writers, social commentators credited Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel with having a profound cultural impact, purportedly inspiring the younger generation of Americans to rebel against the social norms and cultural standards of their elders. Remarking upon the popular association between Fitzgerald and the flaming youth of the Jazz Age, critic Burke Van Allen wrote in 1934 that &quot;no generation of Americans has had a chronicler so persuasive and unmaudlin&quot; as Fitzgerald, and no author was so identified with the generation recorded.

The popular identification of Fitzgerald as the chronicler of carefree youth and proselytizer of Jazz Age hedonism earned him the enmity of reactionary societal figures. When he died in 1940, social conservatives rejoiced over his death. Writing in &quot;The New York World-Telegram&quot;, columnist Westbrook Pegler wrote that Fitzgerald&#x27;s death a few weeks prior reawakened &quot;memories of a queer bunch of undisciplined and self-indulgent brats who were determined not to pull their weight in the boat and wanted the world to drop everything and sit down and bawl with them. A kick in the pants and a clout over the scalp were more like their needing.&quot; Due to this widespread perception of Fitzgerald and his literary works, the Baltimore Diocese denied him a Catholic burial and refused his family permission to intern him at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Rockville, Maryland.

Observing the joyful vitriol expressed by social conservatives after Fitzgerald&#x27;s death, essayist Glenway Wescott opined that such persons could never erase the impact of Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; on 1920s America and young Americans. &quot;Self-congratulatory moral persons may crow over him if they wish,&quot; Wescott wrote in a 1941 editorial, but &quot;&quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; haunted the decade like a song, popular but perfect. It hung over an entire youth movement like a banner, somewhat discolored and windworn now; the wind has lapsed out of it. But a book which college boys really read is a rare thing, not to be dismissed idly or in a moment of severe sophistication.&quot;

<text>Gary Charles &quot;Gar&quot; Samuelson (February 18, 1958 – July 14, 1999) was an American musician best remembered for being the drummer for thrash metal band Megadeth from 1984 to 1987, contributing to their first two albums, &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; (1985) and &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; (1986). He is considered one of the most influential drummers of thrash metal, having pioneered the incorporation of jazz fusion into the subgenre.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Samuelson initially started out playing for The New Yorkers, which included himself, his brother Stew, Chris Poland and Robbie Pagliari, among others. The stint lasted from the late &#x27;70s into the early &#x27;80s.

=== Megadeth ===
After meeting with Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson of Megadeth in 1984, he was asked to join the band on October 24, 1984. Guitarist Chris Poland soon followed, and Mustaine referred to this as &quot;the first real line-up&quot; in the VH1 special on the band. Mustaine stated in an interview with Metal Forces, that Samuelson was able to &quot;mix up a beat.&quot;

Samuelson went on to serve as Megadeth&#x27;s drummer until 1987. He appeared on the band&#x27;s first two albums (&quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good,&quot; and &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying&quot;)&quot;,&quot; and played with them on both tours. However, Samuelson was ultimately fired due to his drug addiction.

At the Woodstock Festival in 1999, Mustaine announced to the crowd that Gar had died. In honor of Gar, Megadeth played Peace Sells as the closing song in their set.

=== Later career ===
After leaving Megadeth, Gar formed a band with Megadeth touring musician, Mike Albert. The band, called Metalist, disbanded prior to signing to record label Combat Records.

Gar later formed the band Fatal Opera, which featured his brother Stew on guitar. The first album, which was released in 1994, had Dave Inman on vocals, Travis Karcher playing bass and Billy Brehme on guitar. The band&#x27;s second album, Eleventh Hour, was released in 1997 and featured Andy Freeman on vocals. Fatal Opera 3, which was a collection of demos, was worked on extensively by his former bandmates and released in 2022.

Samuelson played on two full-length albums and two demos, and remained a member of the band until his death.

== Death ==
Samuelson died in Orange City, Florida, on July 22, 1999, at the age of 41. The cause of death was reportedly liver failure. He was cremated. His former bandmates in Megadeth dedicated the 2002 remaster of &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good&quot; to &quot;the memory of Gar Samuelson&quot;.

<text>Goggles, or safety glasses, are forms of protective eyewear that usually enclose or protect the area surrounding the eye in order to prevent particulates, water or chemicals from striking the eyes. They are used in chemistry laboratories and in woodworking. They are often used in snow sports as well, and in the sport of swimming. Goggles are often worn when using power tools such as drills or chainsaws to prevent flying particles from damaging the eyes. Many types of goggles are available as prescription goggles for those with vision problems.

== History ==
The Inuit and Yupik carved snow goggles from the antlers of caribou, wood, and shell to help prevent snow blindness. The goggles were curved to fit the user&#x27;s face and had a large groove cut in the back to allow for the nose. A long thin slit was cut through the goggles to allow in a small amount of light, diminishing subsequent ultraviolet rays. The goggles were held to the head by a cord made of caribou sinew.

In the early 20th century, goggles were worn by drivers of uncovered cars to prevent irritation of the eyes by dust or wind. Likewise in the first ten years after the invention of the airplane in 1903 goggles became a necessity as wind blow became more severe as aircraft speeds increased and as protection against bugstrikes at high altitudes. The first pilot to wear goggles was probably Charles Manly in his failed attempt to fly Samuel Langley&#x27;s aerodrome in 1903.

In 1875, Matthew Webb attempted to use a form of goggles without a seal (which he called &quot;barnacles&quot;) on his first attempt at swimming across the English Channel, the intent was to shield his eyes from the splashing of the salt water.

==Types==
The requirements for goggles varies depending on the use. Some examples:
* Cold weather: Most modern cold-weather goggles have two layers of lens to prevent the interior from becoming &quot;foggy&quot;. With only a single lens, the interior water vapor condenses onto the lens because the lens is colder than the vapor, although anti-fog agents can be used. The reasoning behind the dual layer lens is that the inner lens will be warm while the outer lens will be cold. As long as the temperature of the inner lens is close to that of the interior water vapor, the vapor should not condense. However, if water vapor gets between the layers of the lens, condensation can occur between the lenses and is almost impossible to get rid of; thus, properly constructed and maintained dual layer lenses should be airtight to prevent water vapor from entering between the lenses.
* Swimming: Must be watertight to prevent water, such as salt water when swimming in the ocean, or chlorinated water when swimming in a pool, from irritating the eyes or blurring vision. Allow swimmers to see clearly underwater. They will not be usable more than a few feet underwater, because the water pressure will press them tightly against the face. (Below this limit, a diving mask must be used, which allows the user to equalize pressure by exhaling air through the nose.) Examples of these include Swedish goggles.
* Power tools: Must be made of an unbreakable material that prevents chunks of metal, wood, plastic, concrete, and so on from hitting or piercing the eye, usually polycarbonate. Usually has some sort of ventilation to prevent sweat from building up inside the goggles and fogging the surface.
* Blowtorch goggles: These protect the eyes from glare and flying sparks and hot metal splashes while using or near a blowtorch. They are not the correct filters for arc welding.
* Welding goggles: Includes all goggles for eye protection during welding or cutting. They provide protection against debris, the heat from welding, and, with the proper filters, the optical radiation resulting from the welding, which can otherwise cause arc eye.
* Motorcycle riding and other open-air activities: Prevents insects, dust, and so on from hitting the eyes.
* Laboratory and research: Combines impact resistance with side shields to prevent chemical splashes reaching the eyes. May also include laser protection which would be covered by EN 207 (Europe) and ANSI Z 136 (United States). Examples of these include red adaptation goggles.
* Racquetball: Protect the eyes from racquets swinging in an enclosed area and from impact from hard rubber ball.
* Winter sports: Protect the eyes from glare and from icy particles flying up from the ground. Double lens anti-fog ski goggles were invented and patented by Robert Earl &quot;Bob&quot; Smith. Visible Light Transmission (VLT) or S value describes the percentage of light allowed through the lens. 
* Astronomy and meteorology: dark adaptor goggles are used before going outside at night, in order to help the eyes adapt to the dark.
* Basketball: Several NBA players have worn goggles during play, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Horace Grant, Kurt Rambis and Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire; they prevent a fellow player from scratching or hitting the eyes when trying to grab the basketball. In most circumstances, a player starts wearing protective goggles to prevent &quot;further&quot; injury to the eyes. They are typically fitted with polycarbonate lenses to ensure impact resistance.
*Gaelic handball and squash: goggles are worn to protect the eye from injury by the ball. The ball used in these sports is smaller than the eye socket, meaning that it can strike the eyeball directly.
* Aviation: In open cockpit aircraft, such as old biplanes, aviators, such as Amelia Earhart and Charles Kingsford Smith, would wear goggles to help protect from the wind and are still in use today. Examples of these include the AN-6530 goggles.
* Virtual reality: A virtual reality headset, sometimes called &quot;goggles&quot;, is a wrap-around visual interface to display computer output. Commonly the computer display information is presented as a three-dimensional representation of real-world environments.
* Drunkenness: Goggles designed to simulate the vision altering effects of psychoactive drugs, in particular alcohol. Examples include Fatal Vision goggles. There are no studies that have found beneficial effects of use of fatal vision goggles on the likelihood that individuals will later engage in impaired driving.

==Goggle types==

== Fashion ==
Goggles are often worn as a fashion statement in certain subcultures, most often as part of the cybergoth subculture. They are usually worn over the eyes or up on the forehead to secure &#x27;falls&#x27;: a type of long, often brightly coloured, synthetic hairpiece. Fans of the steampunk genre or subculture also frequently wear steampunk-styled goggles, particularly when performing in a live action role-playing game.

Goggles are also frequently used by anime and manga characters as a fashion statement. For example, it is an idiosyncrasy of team leader characters in the &quot;Digimon&quot; anime to wear goggles. Other notable characters who wear goggles are the young Naruto Uzumaki and Konohamaru from Naruto, Matt from &quot;Death Note&quot; and Usopp from &quot;One Piece&quot;.

==Non-human==
Goggles are available for horses used in speed sports such as horse racing. In some traditions of horse mounted bullfighting, the horse may wear a protective cloth over its eyes.

Goggles have been used on military working dogs, for protection in harsh conditions, such as sandstorms and rotorwash from helicopters.

<text>Ivan Ivanovich Sollertinsky (3 December 1902 in Vitebsk – 11 February 1944 in Novosibirsk) (Cyrillic: &quot;Ива́н Ива́нович Соллерти́нский&quot;) was a Soviet polymath. He specialized in fields including linguistics, theatre, literature, history, and philology, but was most known for his work in the musical field as a critic and musicologist. He was a professor at the Leningrad Conservatory, as well as an artistic director of the Leningrad Philharmonic, and a prominent orator. In these capacities, he was an active promoter of Mahler&#x27;s music in the Soviet Union. Sollertinsky was also interested in ballet and often wrote essays on the subject during the 1930s, along with teaching ballet history at the Leningrad Choreographic Institute. According to contemporaries – most famously Irakly Andronikov – he had a phenomenal memory, and supposedly spoke 26 languages and 100 dialects. However, Nicolai Malko claimed that Sollertinsky was able to speak 32 languages, some of which were also considered dialects.

==Biography==
Sollertinsky&#x27;s father, Ivan Ivanovich Sollertinsky, came from a family of Russian Orthodox priests and served as a presiding judge, a privy councillor and a senator. His mother was Ekaterina Iosifovna Bobashinskaya, whose family belonged to a noble szlachta branch of the House of Sas.

Early in life he met Mikhail Bakhtin and took part in his philosophical meetings. After moving from Vitebsk to Leningrad, Sollertinsky graduated from the Leningrad University with a degree in Romano-Germanic philology, specializing in Spanish language and literature, particularly the works of Cervantes. In 1927 he became close friends with Dmitri Shostakovich, and is credited with introducing him to the works of Mahler, which had a profound impact on his composition style. Shostakovich&#x27;s letters to Sollertinsky, written from 1927-1944, reveal many aspects of the composer&#x27;s personality seen in few other sources, along with sharp opinions and crippling vulnerabilities.

Sollertinsky supported Shostakovich&#x27;s opera, &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District,&quot; writing that it was an &quot;enormous contribution to Soviet musical culture&quot; in his 1934 review of it in &quot;Rabochii i Teatr&quot; (English: &quot;Workers and Theatre&quot;)&quot;.&quot; In the wake of Shostakovich&#x27;s first denunciation in 1936, Sollertinsky was called &quot;the troubadour of formalism&quot; by &quot;Pravda&quot;. Criticism of &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; grew after its denunciation, resulting in mounting pressure on Sollertinsky to recant his previous statements, as he was largely blamed for influencing Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;formalist&quot; musical style by introducing him to the works of western composers. According to Isaac Glikman, a mutual friend of both Sollertinsky and Shostakovich, Sollertinsky did not denounce &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; until Shostakovich told him to, out of concern for his safety. Once he retracted his previous positive statements on &quot;Lady Macbeth,&quot; Sollertinsky claimed that he would instead study the folklore of the Caucasus region and the Georgian language, perhaps to appeal to Stalin, a native of Georgia. While the denunciation did not deter Shostakovich and Sollertinsky&#x27;s friendship, they did abandon plans to collaborate on a ballet adaptation of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; in 1936.

In 1938, Sollertinsky contracted diphtheria, which temporarily paralyzed his arms, legs, and jaw. During his hospitalization, he and his second wife, Irina Frantsevna, divorced, and he married his third wife, Olga Pantaleimonovna, who would remain with him until his death in 1944. Sollertinsky fathered a son with Olga Pantaleimonovna, Dmitri Ivanovich, named after Shostakovich, breaking a generations-long tradition in which the firstborn son was named Ivan. Olga Pantaleimonovna&#x27;s son from a previous marriage, Kirill, was taken into his care as well. During his four-month period of hospitalization, from June to September, Sollertinsky studied Hungarian and continued to write articles on opera and art.

In August 1941, shortly after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Sollertinsky evacuated from Leningrad with the Philharmonic to Novosibirsk. There, he engaged himself in a number of creative works with the Philharmonic, and frequently traveled in order to give speeches, lectures, and to attend other artistic and cultural events. While he was very much in demand as an orator and scholar during the war years, a heart condition that Sollertinsky&#x27;s doctors had warned him of worsened due to his intense workload and his poor living conditions in Novosibirsk. By April 1943, he was denied a sufficient amount of food for himself and his family due to rationing, and his apartment was unheated. He and Shostakovich saw each other infrequently during the war years, but Vissarion Shebalin arranged for Sollertinsky to teach a course on music history at the conservatory in Moscow, where Shostakovich was living at the time. He briefly stayed in Moscow to give a speech on the anniversary of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death in November 1943, but returned to Novosibirsk with the intention to live and work in Moscow by February 1944. While in Novosibirsk, he delivered the opening remarks for the city&#x27;s premiere of Shostakovich&#x27;s Eighth Symphony, on February 5, 1943, which would be the last speech he was to give before his death. On the night of February 10, 1944, Sollertinsky, feeling unwell, stayed at the house of the conductor A.P. Novikov. He died in his sleep at the age of 41 and was buried at the Zayeltsovskoye Cemetery. His funeral was attended by his students, colleagues, and admirers of his work.

Shostakovich dedicated his Second Piano Trio op. 67 (started December 1943) to the memory of Sollertinsky. The lively second movement of the Trio, according to Sollertinsky&#x27;s sister, Ekaterina Ivanovna, appears to be a &quot;musical portrait&quot; of its dedicatee, while the third movement, in Passacaglia form, is a solemn dirge. The fourth and most famous movement uses klezmer-inspired themes, a possible reference to the victims of the Holocaust, due to the fact that news of the genocide was reaching the Soviet Union at the time. It may also be interpreted as a reference to Sollertinsky&#x27;s birthplace of Vitebsk, which was associated with famous Jewish artist Marc Chagall, and had a sizeable Jewish population until the Vitebsk Ghetto Massacre of 1941, a Nazi atrocity which took place in the city during the war; the klezmer theme is quoted in Shostakovich&#x27;s 1960 String Quartet no. 8. Shostakovich&#x27;s setting of Pasternak&#x27;s translation of Shakespeare Sonnet no. 66 in his &quot;Six Romances on Verses by English Poets&quot; is dedicated to Sollertinsky as well.

<text>Edward Bates (September 4, 1793 – March 25, 1869) was an American lawyer, politician and judge. He represented Missouri in the US House of Representatives and served as the U.S. Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln. A member of the influential Bates family, he was the first US Cabinet appointee from a state west of the Mississippi River.

Born in Goochland County, Virginia, in 1814 Bates moved to St. Louis, where he established a legal practice. He was appointed as the first attorney general of the state of Missouri in 1820. Over the next 30 years, he won election to a single term in Congress and served in both the Missouri House of Representatives and the Missouri Senate, becoming a prominent member of the Whig Party. He also represented Lucy Delaney in a successful freedom suit.

After the breakup of the Whig Party in the early 1850s, he briefly joined the American Party before he became a member of the Republican Party. He was a candidate for president at the 1860 Republican National Convention, but Lincoln won the party&#x27;s nomination. Bates was appointed as attorney general in 1861, at the start of the American Civil War. He successfully carried out some of the administration&#x27;s early war policies, but he disagreed with Lincoln on the issue of the Emancipation Proclamation. He did not support full civil and political equality for Blacks. Bates resigned from the Cabinet in 1864 after he had been passed over for a US Supreme Court appointment. After leaving office, he unsuccessfully opposed the adoption of a new state constitution in Missouri.

==Early life==
Bates was born in Goochland County, Virginia to Thomas Fleming Bates and his wife, the former Caroline Matilda Woodson (1749–1845). His father was a Goochland County native, having been born on his family&#x27;s Belmont plantation, and served in the local militia, including at the Siege of Yorktown at the end of the American Revolutionary War. Like his siblings and others of the planter class, Bates was tutored at home as a boy. When older, he attended Charlotte Hall Military Academy in Maryland.

==Career==
Edward Bates served in the War of 1812 before moving to St. Louis, Missouri Territory, in 1814 with his older brother James, who started working as an attorney. Their eldest brother Frederick Bates was already in St. Louis by that time, where he had served as Secretary of the Louisiana Territory and Secretary of the Missouri Territory.

Edward Bates studied the law with Rufus Easton and boarded with his family. Easton was Judge of the Louisiana Territory, the largest jurisdiction in U.S. history since the Louisiana Purchase. After being admitted to the bar, Bates worked as a partner with Easton.

In 1817, the two organized the James Ferry, which ran from St. Charles, Missouri to Alton, Illinois. Easton had founded the latter town, naming it after his first son Alton.

Bates&#x27;s private practice partner was Joshua Barton, who was appointed as the first Missouri Secretary of State. Barton became infamous for fighting duels on Bloody Island (Mississippi River). In 1816 Bates was the second to Barton in a duel with Thomas Hempstead, brother of Edward Hempstead, the Missouri Territory&#x27;s first Congressional representative. The fight ended without bloodshed. Barton was killed in a duel on the island in 1823.

Bates&#x27;s first foray into politics came in 1820, with election as a member of the state&#x27;s constitutional convention. He wrote the preamble to the state constitution. He was appointed as the new state&#x27;s Attorney General.

In 1822, Bates was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives for a single term (1827–1829). Next, he was elected to the State Senate from 1831 to 1835, then to the Missouri House from 1835. He ran for the U.S. Senate, but lost to Democrat Thomas Hart Benton.

Bates became a prominent member of the Whig Party during the 1840s, where his political philosophy closely resembled that of Henry Clay. While a slaveholder, during this time Bates became interested in the freedom suit of Polly Berry, an enslaved woman who in 1843 gained her freedom decades after having been held illegally for several months in the free state of Illinois.

After she gained her freedom, Berry enlisted Bates&#x27;s support as her attorney in the separate freedom suit she filed for her daughter Lucy Ann Berry, then about age 14. According to the principle of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;, since the mother had been proved a free woman at the time of her daughter&#x27;s birth, the court ruled that Lucy was also legally free. During this time, Orion Clemens, brother of Mark Twain, studied law under Bates.

While Bates is considered by some modern scholars as &quot;generally unsympathetic to the cause of African American freedom,&quot; he emancipated all of his slaves and had paid for his last former slave&#x27;s passage to Liberia by 1851.

In 1850, President Millard Fillmore asked Bates to serve as U.S. Secretary of War, but he declined. Charles Magill Conrad accepted the position. At the Whig National Convention in 1852, Bates was considered for nomination as vice-president on the party ticket, and he led on the first ballot before losing on the second ballot to William Alexander Graham. After the breakup of the Whig Party in the 1850s, Bates briefly joined the Know-Nothing Party but then joined the Republican Party.

==Attorney General==
Bates was one of the four main candidates for the Republican Party&#x27;s 1860 presidential nomination. Bates initially received support from Horace Greeley, who later switched to support Abraham Lincoln. The next year, after winning the election, Lincoln appointed Bates United States Attorney General, an office Bates held from 1861 until 1864. Bates was the first Cabinet member to be appointed from a state or territory west of the Mississippi River.

There was no Justice Department until 1870. Bates had only a small operation, with a staff of six. The main function was to generate legal opinions at the request of Lincoln and cabinet members, and handle occasional cases before the Supreme Court. The cabinet was full of experienced lawyers who seldom felt the need to ask for his opinions. Bates had no authority over the US Attorneys around the country. The federal court system was handled by the Interior Department; the Treasury handled claims. Most of the opinions turned out by Bates&#x27;s office were of minor importance. Lincoln gave him no special assignments and did not seek his advice on Supreme Court appointments. Bates did have a voice on general policy as a cabinet member with a strong political base, but he seldom spoke out. At age 68 he was the oldest high-level Lincoln appointee, and from late 1863 was in poor health.

One key Bates decision involved the question of Black citizenship. In the summer of 1862, a ship sailing out of New Jersey had been detained by customs because its captain was African American. Ship captains were required to be US citizens, and according to the Dred Scott decision Black Americans were not considered citizens. In an opinion published in mid-December, Bates recognized free African Americans as citizens of the United States, contradicting &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. When pressed for clarification by Robert Charles Winthrop, Bates confirmed that citizenship rights were the same regardless of race, and that state laws limiting free Black migration and settlement were unconstitutional.

Bates&#x27;s tenure as Attorney General generally met with mixed reviews. On the one hand, he was important in carrying out some of Lincoln&#x27;s earlier war policies, including the arbitrary arrest of southern sympathizers and seditious northerners. On the other hand, as Lincoln&#x27;s policies became more radical, Bates became increasingly irrelevant. Bates disagreed with Lincoln on emancipation and the recruitment of blacks into the Union Army. In 1864, Lincoln nominated Salmon P. Chase to be Chief Justice, an office Bates had wanted. Bates then resigned and was succeeded by James Speed, a Kentucky lawyer with Radical Republican views.

==Later years==
Bates returned to Missouri after leaving the cabinet. He participated in the conservative struggle over ordinances related to the Missouri constitution of 1865. Bates particularly objected to the &quot;ironclad oath&quot; that was required as a proof of loyalty by residents. He also disapproved of the temporary disfranchisement of rebel sympathizers. He wrote seven essays arguing against the constitution, but it was ratified. It was notable for abolishing slavery in the state, passed three weeks before the US Congress proposed the Thirteenth Amendment to abolish slavery in the US.

Bates retired from politics, although he commented on political events in the local newspapers. He died in St. Louis in 1869 and was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Bates married Julia Coalter from South Carolina. They had 17 children together. She had come to St. Louis to visit her brother David Coalter and her sister Caroline J. Coalter. Her sister Caroline married Hamilton R. Gamble (another attorney and Unionist), who ultimately became chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court.

Bates was, for the most part, happy with his large family. His four sons had various roles during the Civil War. His oldest son, Barton Bates, served on the Supreme Court of Missouri during the war. Son John C. Bates served in the US Army and later became Army Chief of Staff. Son Fleming Bates fought with the Confederates, under the command of General Sterling Price. This caused tension between the father and this son, and Bates rarely mentioned Fleming in his war-time diary. The youngest son, Charles, was still attending West Point during the war.

==In popular culture==
Bates is portrayed by John Billingsley in the Apple TV miniseries &quot;Manhunt&quot; — an anachronism, since the story takes place in 1865 when Bates was no longer attorney general.

<text>Workers&#x27; Youth Theatre, also known as TRAM (the Russian acronym for &quot;Teatr RAbochey Molodyozhi&quot;) was a Soviet proletarian youth theatre of the late 1920s and early 1930s. It was established by Mikhail Sokolovsky in a converted cinema on Liteiny Prospekt, Leningrad. The theatre was run as a collective and produced agitprop pieces designed to educate and persuade. The group worked together with the Left Column, a German agitprop group active in Berlin. A number of the group moved to Moscow in 1931. Helmut Damerius led the two groups from 1931 to 1933.

Adrian Piotrovsky was the theatre&#x27;s principle ideologue, and Dmitri Shostakovich composed some incidental music for a number of its productions. By 1930 the theatre was under attack, accused of &quot;formalism&quot; by its critics from among journalists and rival proletarian organizations.

<doc id="651125" wikidata="Q5505451" url="?curid=651125" title="From Jewish Folk Poetry">
<text>From Jewish Folk Poetry, Op. 79, is a song cycle for soprano, contralto, tenor and piano (or orchestra) by Dmitri Shostakovich. It uses texts taken from the collection &quot;Jewish folk songs&quot;, compiled by I. Dobrushin and A. Yuditsky, edited by Y. M. Sokolov (Goslitizdat, 1947).

The cycle is just one of many works by Shostakovich to incorporate elements of Jewish music; he said that he was attracted by &quot;a jolly melody on sad intonations&quot;. The first eight songs of the piano version was composed in August 1948, after Shostakovich&#x27;s denunciation in the Zhdanov decree of that year. Three more songs, which explore the great life Jews enjoyed under the Soviet regime, were added in October 1948 in order to allow the cycle to pass the censors. Shostakovich also wrote an orchestra version for the cycle, and completed the first 8 songs by October 1948.

The composer&#x27;s situation made a public premiere impossible until January 15, 1955, when it was performed by Shostakovich himself on piano with Nina Dorliak (soprano), Zara Dolukhanova (mezzo-soprano) and Aleksei Maslennikov (tenor). Before the premiere the work received a number of private performances. Premiere of the orchestra version was on February 19, 1964, Gennady Rozhdestvensky conducted Gorky Philharmonic Orchestra with Galina Pisarenko (soprano), Larisa Avdeyeva (mezzo-soprano) and Aleksei Maslennikov (tenor) as the soloists.

== Structure ==

The cycle consists of 11 songs:

<doc id="651128" wikidata="Q2411249" url="?curid=651128" title="Song of the Forests">
<text>The Song of the Forests (&quot;Песнь о лесах&quot;), Op. 81, is an oratorio by Dmitri Shostakovich composed in the summer of 1949. It was written to celebrate the forestation of the Russian steppes (Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature) following the end of World War II. The composition originally included texts by Yevgeny Dolmatovsky praising Joseph Stalin as the &quot;great gardener&quot;; these references were eliminated after his death. Premiered by the Leningrad Philharmonic under Yevgeny Mravinsky on 15 November 1949, the work was well received by the government, earning the composer a Stalin Prize the following year.

==Structure==
The oratorio lasts around 40 minutes and is written in seven movements:

# When the War Was Over
# The Call Rings Throughout the Land
# Memory of the Past
# The Pioneers Plant the Forests
# The Fighters of Stalingrad Forge Onward
# A Walk into the Future
# Glory

==Overview==

===In the shadow of the Zhdanov decree===
Compared to most of Shostakovich&#x27;s other output, especially several of his symphonies, it is all too easy to consider &quot;The Song of the Forests&quot; a simplistic and overtly accessible &quot;official&quot; piece without remembering the context of the time in which it was written. In 1948 Shostakovich, along with many other composers, was again denounced for formalism in the Zhdanov decree. Simplistic and overtly accessible compositions was exactly what the Party demanded. Shostakovich was not the only one writing &quot;safe&quot; pieces at this time. Prokofiev composed his oratorio &quot;On Guard for Peace&quot; and Myaskovsky wrote his 27th Symphony. Even so, Soviet attacks on composers were both arbitrary and unpredictable, due in no small part to vagueness surrounding the theory of socialist realism in music and how it should be applied. Marina Frolova-Walker stated the situation this way:
For Shostakovich the story of 1936 was repeated, only this time he was not alone. Most of his works were banned, he was forced to publicly repent, and his family had privileges withdrawn. Yuri Lyubimov says that at this time &quot;he waited for his arrest at night out on the landing by the lift, so that at least his family wouldn&#x27;t be disturbed&quot;. In the next few years Shostakovich divided his compositions into film music to pay the rent, official works aimed at securing official rehabilitation, and serious works &quot;for the desk drawer&quot;. The latter included the Violin Concerto No. 1 and the song cycle &quot;From Jewish Folk Poetry&quot;.

===Composition===
For practical reasons (not to mention those of personal survival), Shostakovich began using two distinct musical idioms in which to compose. The first was more simplified and accessible to comply with Party guidelines. The second was more complex and abstract to fulfill himself artistically. &quot;The Song of the Forests&quot; belongs in the first category. In his &quot;official&quot; style he set a text by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky, a poet high in Party favor. Dolmatovsky had seen the then-new forest plantations and shared his experiences with the composer.

Shostakovich creates an arc from the opening evocation of vastness of the Russian steppes with a dark, almost Mussorgskian recollection of the devastation of the war just past, to a closing fugue of vigor and affirmation. In between these two points are a series of choral songs encouraging the planting of trees. While composing this piece, Shostakovich read an article in his daughter&#x27;s school newspaper about groups of &quot;Pioneers&quot;—the Soviet youth movement—becoming involved in the planting project. He asked Dolmatovsky to supply additional lines for children&#x27;s chorus to represent the Pioneers&#x27; efforts. A lyrical movement just before the finale is reminiscent of the recently castigated Eighth Symphony, though more &quot;accessible&quot; to avoid censure. The final fugue, Shostakovich felt, was a risk since fugues were considered formalistic. By using a Russian folk song as the basis for the movement and the potential of citing Glinka as a model, he felt he reduced the risk factor substantially.

===Instrumentation===
:Woodwind: 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (3rd doubling english horn), 3 clarinets, 2 bassoons
:Brass: 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba
:Percussion:
::timpani
::triangle, snare drum, cymbals, glockenspiel
:Other: celesta, 2 harps, strings
:Brass band: 6 trumpets, 6 trombones

==Lyrics==
The full cantata has 7 sections.
# Когда окончилась война – When the War Ended
# Оденем Родину в леса – We will clothe the Motherland with forests
# Воспоминание о прошлом – Memories of the Past
# Пионеры сажают леса – The Pioneers Plant the Forests
# Комсомольцы выходят вперед – The Young Communists go forth
# Будущая прогулка – A Walk into the Future 
# Слава – Glory

The title of the poem Оденем Родину в леса! is repeated as a refrain in the cantata. The second movement of the cantata begins as follows:
:Звучит, летит на всю страну,
:Разносит ветер голоса:
:&quot;Объявим засухе войну,
:Оденем Родину в леса,
:Оденем Родину в леса!&quot;

==Continued popularity==
While &quot;Song of the Forest&quot; has been considered neither the best nor the most popular of Shostakovich&#x27;s oeuvre, it continues to be performed and recorded because it is an attractive musical pastiche. Reminiscences of the boys&#x27; chorus from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Pique Dame&quot; rub shoulders with Glinka and even Mussorgsky. There is additionally a direct influence of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, especially the introspective third and fourth movements. Shostakovich hints at this in the similarity of titles between the two compositions. The propaganda value of &quot;The Song of the Forests&quot; may have been purely superficial, but it was enough to satisfy Party ideologues.

===Nods to officialdom===
The composer considered this oratorio a shameful work. Before the work&#x27;s premiere, Isaak Glikman told Shostakovich, &quot;It would be so good if instead of Stalin you had, say, the queen of the Netherlands—she&#x27;s a big fan of reforestation. The composer replied, &#x27;That would be wonderful! I take responsibility for the music, but as for the words...&#x27;&quot;

===Influence on Prokofiev===
On November 26, 1949, Sergei Prokofiev and his wife Mira attended the Moscow premiere of &quot;Song of the Forests&quot;. According to Mira, Prokofiev said &quot;the oratorio was masterly, the instrumentation brilliant, but it was not rich in melodic material.&quot; Its success reignited Prokofiev&#x27;s desire to compose &quot;On Guard for Peace&quot;; he regularly studied &quot;Song of the Forests&quot; during the composition of his own oratorio.

<text>Solomon Moiseyevich Volkov (; born 17 April 1944) is a Russian journalist and musicologist. He is best known for &quot;Testimony&quot;, which was published in 1979 following his emigration from the Soviet Union in 1976. According to him, the book was the memoir of Dmitri Shostakovich, as related to him by the composer.

==Life==
Volkov was born in Uroteppa (Russian: &quot;Ura-Tyube&quot;, now Istaravshan), near Leninabad, Tajik SSR (today Khujand, Tajikistan. He studied violin at the Leningrad Conservatory and graduated with honors in 1967. He continued graduate work in musicology there until 1971. He also served as artistic director of the Experimental Studio of Chamber Opera.

He emigrated to the United States in June 1976. Early on, he was a research associate at the Russian Institute of Columbia University. He lives in New York City with his wife, Marianna (née Tiisnekka), a pianist and photographer. He reportedly became a United States citizen.

==Expertise==
His primary area of expertise has been the history and aesthetics of Russian and Soviet music, as well as the psychology of musical perception and performance. He published numerous articles in scholarly and popular journals and wrote the book &quot;Young Composers of Leningrad&quot; in 1971. This book, which contained a preface by Shostakovich, was reportedly well received.

Since taking residence in the United States, he has written various articles for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Musical America&quot;, &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot; and other publications.

==Controversy over &quot;Testimony&quot;==
Volkov&#x27;s book &quot;Testimony&quot; (Russian: &quot;Свидетельство&quot;), which Volkov said represents the memoirs of Shostakovich, was published in October 1979.

Questions about &quot;Testimony&#x27;s&quot; authenticity are summarized in Malcolm H. Brown&#x27;s book &quot;A Shostakovich Casebook&quot; (2004), whereas a defense of the memoirs and their authenticity is presented in Allan B. Ho and Dmitry Feofanov&#x27;s &quot;Shostakovich Reconsidered&quot; (1998). The latter also have written &quot;The Shostakovich Wars&quot;, a 220-page long response to Brown&#x27;s &quot;Shostakovich Casebook&quot;.

Some have asserted the book&#x27;s authenticity due to Shostakovich&#x27;s son Maxim&#x27;s alleged about-face on the accuracy of the book. After he defected to the West in 1981, he told the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; that it was a book &quot;about my father, not by him&quot;. However, in a BBC television interview with composer Michael Berkeley on 27 September 1986, Maxim said, &quot;It&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s accurate... The basis of the book is correct.&quot; American scholar Laurel E. Fay stated that whilst Maxim said that the general context of the times and what it would have been to live as a composer under Soviet rule are generally correct, that Shostakovich&#x27;s individual portrait was &quot;grossly misconstrued&quot; 

To Dmitry Feofanov, Maxim emphasized repeatedly in 1997: &quot;I am a supporter both of &quot;Testimony&quot; and of Volkov.&quot; Maxim also was the guest of honor at the launching of the Czech edition of the memoirs in 2005 and, with his sister Galina, contributed an introduction to the second Russian edition of Volkov&#x27;s &quot;Shostakovich and Stalin&quot; in 2006, which includes the following: &quot;We, Shostakovich’s children, who watched his life pass before our eyes, express our profound gratitude to Solomon Volkov for his marvelous work, the naked truth of which will undoubtedly help our contemporaries and future generations better to see the difficult fate of our unforgettable father, and through it, better to understand his music.&quot;

Shostakovich&#x27;s widow&#x27;s later reaction to the book was one of skepticism: &quot;Volkov saw Dmitrich three or maybe four times. ... He was never an intimate friend of the family — he never had dinner with us here, for instance . ... I don&#x27;t see how he could have gathered enough material from Dmitrich for such a thick book.&quot; The critics of &quot;Testimony&quot; said that this further calls into question the book&#x27;s authenticity. However, Volkov had a 15-year professional relationship with Dmitri Shostakovich. It started in 1960 when Volkov reviewed Shostakovich&#x27;s String Quartet No. 8, and Shostakovich wrote a preface for Volkov&#x27;s book &quot;Molodyye Kompozitory Leningrada&quot; (&quot;Young Composers of Leningrad&quot;) in 1971. In addition, Irina Shostakovich is now the only member of the Shostakovich family who denounces &quot;Testimony&quot;. Son Maxim and daughter Galina endorse it.

In 1984, during an interview in Brussels for the Flemish Classical Radio (KlaRa), Yuri Ahronovich recalled that - while in Rome - he was the first who had seen Volkov&#x27;s manuscript. He said : «Ich wörde sagen daß sehr viel in diesem Buch steht daß könnte sein ...» But he added that for sure there is one mistake : Volkov writes that Shostakovich didn&#x27;t respect Prokofiev and vice-versa. This is not true («stimmt nicht»). 

Although Volkov remains reluctant to respond to criticisms of himself and of &quot;Testimony&quot;, on February 15, 1999, he appeared with Vladimir Ashkenazy, Allan B. Ho, and Dmitry Feofanov at an open forum at the Mannes College of Music to answer questions about the memoirs. Unfortunately, none of his principal critics attended this session. Volkov provided input into the books by Ho and Feofanov.

Despite its translation into 30 different languages, the Russian original has never been published, prompting speculation from the critics that Volkov is afraid to publish it in Russian because &quot;Anybody who has heard Dmitri Dmitrievich&#x27;s living voice even once would realize right away that it is a forgery.&quot; The copyrights of &quot;Testimony&quot;, however, belong to Volkov&#x27;s American publisher, and it is not up to Volkov to allow or to deny a Russian-language publication of &quot;Testimony&quot;. Moreover, Maxim and Galina Shostakovich and many others have read copies of the original Russian typescript and believe the book to be genuine. In an interview with Feofanov in 1995, Galina stated:
&quot;I am an admirer of Volkov. There is nothing false there [in &quot;Testimony&quot;]. Definitely the style of speech is Shostakovich’s — not only the choice of words, but also the way they are put together.&quot;

==Other works==
His other books include &quot;St. Petersburg: A Cultural History&quot; (1995), &quot;Shostakovich and Stalin: The Extraordinary Relationship Between the Great Composer and the Brutal Dictator&quot; (2004), &quot;The Magical Chorus: A History of Russian Culture from Tolstoy to Solzhenitsyn&quot; (2008), and &quot;Romanov Riches: Russian Writers and Artists Under the Tsars&quot; (2011). In Russia, Solomon Volkov is also well known due to his dialogues with Joseph Brodsky, collected and published in 1998. He has also published volumes of memoirs with other major figures, including &quot;Balanchine&#x27;s Tchaikovsky: Conversations with Balanchine on his Life, Ballet and Music&quot; (1985) and &quot;From Russia to the West: the Musical Memoirs and Reminiscences of Nathan Milstein&quot; (1990). In 2013, Volkov was the interviewer in a three-hour film &quot;Dialogues with Yevtushenko,&quot; which was shown during prime time on Russian TV. In 2014, Volkov followed the film about Yevtushenko with a film about Vladimir Spivakov, a world-known Russian violinist and conductor, &quot;Dialogues with Vladimir Spivakov.&quot; In addition to the film, Volkov wrote a book with the similar title.

<text>Antiformalist Rayok (), also known as Learner&#x27;s Manual, without opus number, is a satirical cantata for four voices, chorus, and piano by Dmitri Shostakovich. It is subtitled As an aid to students: the struggle of the realistic and formalistic directions in music. It satirizes the conferences that resulted from the Zhdanov decree of 1948 and the anti-formalism campaign in Soviet arts which followed it.

The work includes quotations from Andrei Zhdanov&#x27;s speech at the Conference of the Musicians at the Central Committee of the all-Union Party in Moscow in January 1948. The libretto also incorporates Dmitri Shepilov&#x27;s speech at the Second Congress of Composers in 1957, in which he mispronounces the name of the composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (&quot;KorSAkov&quot;). In regard to music, there are references to the traditional Georgian folk song &quot;Suliko&quot;, Joseph Stalin&#x27;s favourite song, and the popular Russian folk tunes &quot;Kalinka&quot; and &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot;. It also contains musical excerpts from Tikhon Chrennikov&#x27;s film music &quot;True friends&quot; and Robert Planquette&#x27;s operetta &quot;Les cloches de Corneville&quot;. In addition, the note sequence D–E♭–C–B, the composer&#x27;s own monogram based on German note names (D–S–C–H), occurs once in the cantata in a different key.

&quot;Antiformalist Rayok&quot; was not performed publicly during the composer&#x27;s lifetime. Nonetheless, Shostakovich planned to publish the work in the early 1960s and had intended Opus No. 114 for it. Particularly, the premiere of Symphony No. 13 &quot;Babi Yar&quot; (1962), which had provoked enormous disapproval among the Soviet leadership of the Communist Party (the symphony&#x27;s song text denounces the Soviet anti-Semitism of the time), was probably the main reason why Shostakovich had not considered publishing his satirical cantata. &quot;Antiformalist Rayok&quot; was premiered 14 years after the composer&#x27;s death in 1989.

==Background==
Conflicting dates are documented for the composition of &quot;Antiformalist Rayok&quot;. According to Isaak Glikman and the Shostakovich family, the score was begun in 1948, with further revisions in 1957, followed by a finale composed between 1965 and 1968. The finale was not discovered until May 1989 by Veniamin Basner. Lev Lebedinsky recalled that the whole work dates from 1957 and that he, rather than Shostakovich, wrote the text. Current scholarship has not verified Lebedinsky&#x27;s statements. According to some of the composer&#x27;s diary notes, it can be assumed that the Soviet poet Yevgeny Dolmatovsky, who had written the lyrics for the cantatas &quot;Song of the forests&quot; op. 81 and &quot;The Sun Shines Over Our Motherland&quot; op. 90, also contributed to the libretto.

Its first public performance was on 12 January 1989 conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich at the Kennedy Center Concert Hall in Washington, D.C. At this concert, the cantata was sung in English and performed without the finale composed in the late 1960s. The premiere of the work in its original version took place at the Bolshoi Hall of the Moscow Conservatory on the composer&#x27;s 83rd birthday (25 September 1989).

In 1989, Boris Tishchenko orchestrated the piano part. In the 1990s, Vladimir Milman and Vladimir Spivakov made another orchestral version. This version was recorded in 2003 and released by Capriccio.

<text>Ophioglossum vulgatum, commonly known as adder&#x27;s-tongue, southern adder&#x27;s-tongue or adder&#x27;s-tongue fern, is a species of fern in the family &quot;Ophioglossaceae&quot;.

The chloroplast genome was reported to have a size of 138,562 base pairs.

==Description==
&quot;Ophioglossum vulgatum&quot; grows from a rhizome base to 10–20 cm tall (rarely to 30 cm). It consists of a two-part frond, separated into a 4-12 cm rounded diamond-shaped leaf sheath and narrow branchless spore-bearing spike. The spike has around 10-40 segments on each side.

It reproduces by means of spores.

==Taxonomy==
Linnaeus described adder&#x27;s-tongue with the binomial &quot;Ophioglossum vulgatum&quot; in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; of 1753.

==Distribution==
It is native to many regions with a wide scattered distribution: throughout temperate through tropical Africa and throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere in Europe, northeastern North America, temperate Asia, and Eurasia. 

== Habitat ==
This small, hard-to-spot plant can occur singly in unimproved pastures, rock crevices and grassy path-sides, but also can occur in colonies of hundreds of plants in sand dunes.

In Finland, unlike elsewhere, it grows on seashores, unlike other parts of the world where it tends to be a calciphile. Finland has fitting lime rich soil habitat sparsely, but the plant has found an equivalent living habitat from Finland&#x27;s seashores affected by a post-glacial rebound: land just risen from the sea is often quite neutral and cointains mineral salts in addition to being open and bare enough.

==Rarity==
This species is rare in most European countries. In Ukraine, there were recorded 280 loci: 152 before 1980, after 1980 – 120, as before and after 1980 – 8 locations.
==Uses==
Traditional European folk use of leaves and rhizomes as a poultice for wounds. This remedy was sometimes called the &quot;Green Oil of Charity&quot;. A tea made from the leaves was used as a traditional European folk remedy for internal bleeding and vomiting.

<text>Hank Joe Blalock (born November 21, 1980) is an American former professional baseball third baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers and Tampa Bay Rays.

==High school==
Blalock attended Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego, California. He was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 3rd round of the 1999 Major League Baseball Draft.

==Minor leagues==
Blalock broke into professional baseball with the Gulf Coast League Rangers of the Rookie League in 1999. Blalock ended 1999, and spent all of 2000 with the Low-A Savannah Sand Gnats. Blalock burst into the public&#x27;s consciousness with a huge 2001 season. Splitting time between the Charlotte Rangers of the Florida State League and the Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League, Blalock put up huge offensive numbers and hit for the cycle twice in one week, establishing himself as one of the top prospects in the game.

Blalock began the 2002 season as the Rangers&#x27; starting third baseman, but after a slow start was sent back to the minors, and spent most of the year playing for the Triple-A Oklahoma Redhawks of the Pacific Coast League.

==Major leagues==
In 2003, Blalock had a breakthrough year, hitting 29 home runs and 90 RBIs with a .309 batting average. A combination of being able to hit for power and for average drew early comparisons to George Brett and helped him to get voted to the All-Star Game in his first full season as a Ranger, where he hit the game-winning home run off Los Angeles Dodgers closer Éric Gagné in the bottom of the 8th inning to give the American League a 7-6 victory.

Blalock finished the 2004 season with 32 home runs and over 100 RBIs, and was voted to his second All-Star Game, when he participated in the Home Run Derby. A disappointing 2005 season made Blalock the center of many trade rumors. He was not traded, however, and he played 2006 with the Rangers.

Hank had his own fan club called Hank&#x27;s Homies during his time with the Rangers. They were a group of guys who wore cowboy hats, eyeblack, and Blalock jerseys to the games. The Rangers even installed hooks for the Homies to hang their sign to support Hank.

On Mother&#x27;s Day, May 14, 2006, Blalock was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. He hit his 100th career home run on June 23, 2006, in the sixth inning of a game against the Colorado Rockies.

Blalock&#x27;s decreasing performance since his breakout 2003 season led many to believe that he would be traded to make room for Mark DeRosa to take a full-time position in the Rangers&#x27; infield. However, the hiring of new manager Ron Washington, who was credited with improving the play of Oakland Athletics third baseman Eric Chavez, seemed to guarantee that Blalock would not be traded; and in fact, the Rangers declined to sign DeRosa, allowing him to file for free agency.

Blalock was diagnosed with Thoracic outlet syndrome during the 2007 season and underwent surgery in May 2007 to remove his first rib. He returned to the lineup in September, but did not take the field at third base until 2008 in spring training.

During the 2008 season, Blalock injured a hamstring, placing him on the disabled list again for the second time in two seasons. On May 18, 2008, Blalock and the Rangers announced that upon his return to the team, he would return as a first baseman. Blalock had never played first base as a professional, but he felt it was the best move for the team, as the Rangers had not seen much offensive production from their first basemen in 2008. Blalock worked with Ron Washington and spoke with Phil Nevin (who made a similar switch from third to first with San Diego in 2002) to start learning the position. With the emergence of Chris Davis at first base, Blalock temporarily returned to third, but eventually switched positions with Davis to avoid more shoulder problems.
Blalock signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays for the 2010 season. His contract was purchased on May 15. He was designated for assignment on June 29, 2010 to make room for Gabe Kapler, and was released on July 8.

Blalock retired after the 2010 season, and currently resides in San Diego.

==Family in baseball==
Hank&#x27;s younger brother, Jake Blalock, played in the Texas Rangers organization from 2006–2007, after being acquired from the Philadelphia Phillies along with Robinson Tejeda in exchange for outfielder David Dellucci on the eve of the 2006 season. Jake returned to the Phillies system in July 2007 as a free agent.

Hank&#x27;s uncle, Sam, is a high school baseball coach.

<text>Mikhail Mikhailovich Zoshchenko (; – 22 July 1958) was a Soviet and Russian writer and satirist.

==Biography==
Zoshchenko was born in 1894, in Saint Petersburg, Russia, according to his 1953 autobiography. Other sources suggest that he was born in Poltava, in present-day Ukraine. His Ukrainian father was an artist and a mosaicist responsible for the exterior decoration of the Suvorov Museum in Saint Petersburg. His mother was Russian. Zoshchenko attended the Faculty of Law at the Saint Petersburg University, but did not graduate due to financial problems. During World War I, Zoshchenko served in the army as a field officer, was wounded in action several times, and was heavily decorated. In 1919, during the Russian Civil War, he served for several months in the Red Army before being discharged for health reasons.
He was associated with the Serapion Brothers and attained particular popularity in the 1920s as a satirist, but, after his denunciation in the Zhdanov decree of 1946, Zoshchenko lived in dire poverty. He was awarded his pension only a few months before he died. 
Zoshchenko developed a simplified deadpan style of writing which simultaneously made him accessible to &quot;the people&quot; and mocked official demands for accessibility: &quot;I write very compactly. My sentences are short. Accessible to the poor. Maybe that&#x27;s the reason why I have so many readers.&quot; Volkov compares this style to the nakedness of the Russian holy fool or &quot;yurodivy&quot;. 
In 1940 Zoshchenko published a series of short stories for children about Vladimir Lenin.

==Criticism==
A critical anthology&quot; Мих. Зощенко: pro et contra, антология&quot; was published in 2015. It included a 1926 article by Iakov Moiseyevich Shafir.

<text>Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians is an American alternative rock jam band that originated in Dallas, Texas, in the mid-1980s. The band is widely known for their 1988 hit &quot;What I Am&quot; from the album &quot;Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars&quot;. Their music contains elements of rock, folk, blues, and jazz. Following the 1990 release of their second album &quot;Ghost of a Dog&quot;, lead singer Edie Brickell left the band and married singer-songwriter Paul Simon. In 2006, she and the band launched a new web site and released a new album, &quot;Stranger Things&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early years and beginnings ===
New Bohemians started as a trio in the early 1980s, gaining experience in the Deep Ellum neighborhood of downtown Dallas, Texas. The original line-up featured Brad Houser on vibraslap, Eric Presswood on guitar, and Brandon Aly on drums.

Drummer Aly, guitarist Kenny Withrow, and percussionist John Bush went to the same arts magnet high school in Dallas: Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. Singer Edie Brickell also went to this school; however, the other members of the band didn&#x27;t know her until later, and according to Houser, Edie was there for art. Houser attended Hillcrest High School and lived in the same neighborhood as other band members. He played in various neighborhood bands like &quot;The Knobs&quot; which included Kenny Withrow, and was also in &quot;the Munch Puppies&quot;.

The additional core members joined in 1985. Edie became the singer after being encouraged to join the band onstage during a show. It was soon after such first show that a local agent who was booking bands at Rick&#x27;s Casablanca was brought to hear the band. The band signed a six-month management contract which brought with it better paying gigs at Rick&#x27;s. When the six months ended, they started regular gigging in the Deep Ellum neighborhood of the city. Presswood left and Kenny Withrow joined as guitarist, playing his first show in July 1985 at the Starck Club in Dallas. John Bush joined on percussion in September of that year: his first show with the band was September 12, 1985, at Poor David&#x27;s Pub in Dallas, when the band was backing Bo Diddley.

&quot;New Bos&quot;, the name the band assumed then, were a local favorite, packing in the fans at now-famous Deep Ellum venues such as &quot;Theater Gallery&quot;, &quot;500 Cafe&quot;, and &quot;Club Dada&quot;. They were also regular performers at the annual Fry Street Fair on the University of North Texas campus in Denton, Texas. During this period of the band history, Edie&#x27;s name was not used in that of the band.

=== Release of the albums and the successful first one ===
Their debut album, &quot;Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars&quot;, was released in 1988 and became a commercial success. It produced the US top 10 hit &quot;What I Am&quot;. The following album, &quot;Ghost of a Dog&quot;, was released in 1990 and was less successful. New Bohemians disbanded soon after the album&#x27;s release. In the mid-1990s, Brickell, Bush and Withrow gave birth to &quot;The Slip&quot;, a side project.

Years later, New Bohemians released both a compilation and a live album. In 2006, current members reunited to record and tour, with the release of the album &quot;Stranger Things&quot; on July 25 that year. On September 3, 2007, the group mourned the accidental shooting death of band member Carter Albrecht, who was killed in Dallas that day.

On October 12, 2018, the band released the album Rocket. On February 19, 2021, the band released the third album after the reunion, &quot;Hunter and the Dog Star&quot;.

=== Live shows and concerts ===
The band played live at the &quot;North Oak Cliff Music Festival&quot; in October 2014 with the current lineup as well as keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist Matt Hubbard. The band reunited again in April 2017 with three concerts at the &quot;Kessler Theater&quot; in &quot;Oak Cliff&quot;.

<doc id="651150" wikidata="Q2050990" url="?curid=651150" title="String Quartet No. 15 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The String Quartet No. 15 in E-flat minor, Op. 144 by Dmitri Shostakovich is the composer&#x27;s last. It was his first quartet since the Sixth (and only one of three) which did not bear a dedication.

==History==
According to Sofia Khentova, the Fifteenth Quartet was intended as a &quot;milestone&quot; heralding the next nine string quartets that Shostakovich intended to compose for the Beethoven Quartet. He had previously promised them a cycle of 24 quartets in all major and minor keys. Shostakovich told the quartet&#x27;s leader, , that the next quartet would be dedicated to the Beethoven Quartet as a testament to his loyalty to the ensemble. Shostakovich&#x27;s Fifteenth Quartet was modeled on the Third Quartet by his former pupil, Boris Tchaikovsky, which is composed entirely of slow movements.

On May 2, 1974, Shostakovich telephoned Isaak Glikman and told him he had begun work on a new string quartet. Despite difficulties with his right hand, he continued to compose while convalescing in a Moscow hospital. After being discharged, he and his wife traveled to their dacha in Repino for the summer. He completed the quartet on May 17, 1974. On June 3, Glikman visited Shostakovich, who told him he had completed the quartet: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how good it is, but I had some joy in writing it.&quot; The Fifteenth was his first quartet since the Sixth and one of only three that did not bear a dedication. It was also only one of two that were not premiered by the Beethoven Quartet.

In September, Shostakovich returned to Moscow and presented his new quartet to the members of the Beethoven Quartet. By that point, poor health left Shostakovich unable to give a preliminary performance on the piano as he had with his previous quartets. He handed the score to Tsyganov and told him, &quot;I cannot play it. Just see it for yourself.&quot; The quartet&#x27;s cellist, , one of the group&#x27;s two remaining founding members, had a heart attack earlier that year and was also having health problems at the time. As a result, the Beethoven Quartet delayed rehearsals for the Fifteenth&#x27;s premiere, which worried Shostakovich. During the rehearsals, he asked the members to play the opening movement &quot;so that flies drop dead in mid-air and the audience start leaving the hall from sheer boredom.&quot; After rehearsals on the morning of October 18, Shirinsky died. Shostakovich asked the Taneyev Quartet, whom he had already familiarized with the score, to take over the responsibility of the world premiere, an offer which they accepted.

Prior to the Moscow premiere, Dmitri Tsyganov, the Beethoven Quartet&#x27;s last surviving founding member, visited Shostakovich in the hospital for interpretive advice. The composer said to him that he had begun to think over his next quartet, then added: &quot;You know, Mitya, I will not be able to finish the cycle of 24 quartets I had promised you.&quot;

==Music==
The String Quartet No. 15 consists of six movements played without pause. All but one of its movements are marked &quot;Adagio&quot;, with the outlier being the &quot;Funeral March&quot; marked &quot;Adagio molto&quot;:

A fugue based on a folk-like theme makes up the opening &quot;Elegy,&quot; the longest of the six movements. It is followed by a &quot;Serenade&quot; in which a series of &quot;sforzandi&quot; frame a fragmented waltz melody, both of which are constructed from a twelve-note series. This gives way to the &quot;Intermezzo,&quot; which conceals a self-quotation from &quot;The Nose&quot;, a score which had been revived in the Soviet Union for the first time in 45 years while the quartet&#x27;s premiere was being prepared. A lyrical &quot;Nocturne&quot; follows, after which a characteristic dotted-motif played unison announces the &quot;Funeral March.&quot; The quartet closes with an &quot;Epilogue&quot; which briefly recalls the preceding movements, before fading away diminuendo.

In an article published by the &quot;Information Bulletin of the Copyright Agency of the Soviet Union&quot;, Shostakovich wrote, &quot;I tried to make [the Fifteenth Quartet] a dramatic work; it is hard to say whether I succeeded.&quot;

A typical performance lasts approximately 37 minutes. It is the longest of Shostakovich&#x27;s quartets.

==Premieres==
The world premiere took place in Leningrad on November 15, 1974, at the Glinka Maly Theatre with the composer in attendance. On January 11, 1975, the Beethoven Quartet premiered the work in Moscow, with cellist Yevgeny Altman replacing Shirinsky.

The first performance outside the Soviet Union took place in Coventry, England on March 11, 1975, at the University of Warwick&#x27;s Arts Centre; the work was performed by the Fitzwilliam Quartet. The American premiere followed on January 23, 1976, at Diablo Valley College in Concord, California. It was performed by a quartet of local amateur musicians in a program dedicated to Shostakovich&#x27;s memory; the performers were violinists Charles Strong and Charles Blossom, violist David Green, and cellist Anna Jovanovich. The latter had received a copy of the score from Irina Shostakovich, the composer&#x27;s widow, during a visit to the Soviet Union.

==Reception==
After listening to a private performance by the Taneyev Quartet at his apartment, Shostakovich thanked them for &quot;having penetrated so deeply the essence of this philosophical work, which I hold most dear.&quot; In an article published in &quot;&quot; on November 15, 1974, Shostakovich called the Taneyev Quartet &quot;first-class musicians who play the [Fifteenth Quartet] superbly.&quot;

Shostakovich invited his colleague Dmitry Kabalevsky to the rehearsals for the new quartet&#x27;s premiere. Kabalevsky was initially moved emotionally by the quartet, but later expressed reservations. His suggestion that each movement should bear a programmatic title borrowed from Romain Rolland was not received positively by Shostakovich. According to Krzysztof Meyer, the Fifteenth Quartet was greeted with a standing ovation at its premiere, which Shostakovich acknowledged with difficulty because of his deteriorating physical abilities.

The critical reception following the Fifteenth Quartet&#x27;s British and American premieres was mostly positive. Gerald Larner in &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;a beautiful work, a credible and more than worthy companion to the recent symphonies&quot; and that it was &quot;yet another demonstration how fruitful, in creative terms, is Shostakovich&#x27;s present preoccupation with death.&quot; In a review for the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;, John Falding wrote that Shostakovich&#x27;s ability to sustain the quartet&#x27;s &quot;haunting sadness and [its] atmosphere of total desolation&quot; was a &quot;mark of [his] brilliance&quot;. Charles Shere in the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; felt the music was an homage to Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s late music, while a review in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called the quartet &quot;a daring and often touching conception, even if its feelings and mannerisms have already appeared often in Shostakovich&#x27;s work.&quot; Stephen Walsh in &quot;The Observer&quot; appraised the work negatively and compared it unfavorably to the Eighth Quartet. He also described the composer&#x27;s late style as having &quot;more than a trace of surrender&quot; and prone to repeating itself:

But whereas in the [Eighth Quartet] this style was still new and obviously expressed something deeply personal for the composer, in the [Fifteenth] it takes on an altogether more negative aspect—becomes, in fact, the mere absence of resource. It&#x27;s as if the composer established long ago what his elegiac style ought to be, and was now simply using it again, but without the feeling of newness.

Kurt Sanderling, a friend of the composer, speculated that he meant the work as an epitaph for himself: &quot;Perhaps because it was so unfathomably terrifying that he could not dedicate it to anyone.&quot; In her overview of Shostakovich&#x27;s quartets, Wendy Lesser wrote that what the composer &quot;feelingly realizes in this quartet is that there can be no settling into comfortable resignation, no weak or even fearless embrace of death, because something in us always wants to live.&quot;

<text>José Antonio Romualdo Pacheco (October 31, 1831January 23, 1899) was a Californio statesman and diplomat. A Republican, he is best known as the only Hispanic man to serve as governor of California since the American Conquest of California, and as the first Latino to represent a state in the U.S. Congress. Pacheco was elected and appointed to various state, federal, and diplomatic offices throughout his more than thirty-year career, including serving as a California State Treasurer, California State Senator, and three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Early life==

José Antonio Romualdo Pacheco was a Californio, born in Santa Barbara, California, to a family with prominent connections. His father, José Antonio Romualdo Pacheco, had moved to Alta California from Guanajuato in 1825, and served as an aide to José María de Echeandía during his tenure as governor of Alta California. Pacheco&#x27;s father was killed at the Battle of Cahuenga Pass in 1831, when the young Romualdo was just five weeks old. His father had shot José María Avila, who had attacked Alta California Governor Manuel Victoria with a lance, but died when Avila&#x27;s lance struck him. 

His mother, María Ramona Carrillo de Pacheco, was a sister-in-law of General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo and a daughter of María Ygnacia López de Carrillo, the grantee of Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa. After the death of his father, Romualdo&#x27;s mother married Captain John D. Wilson, a Scotsman, who sent Pacheco to Honolulu, Hawaii, for his education.

At age twelve, Pacheco began an apprenticeship aboard a trading vessel. The Mexican–American War broke out two years later, and he was briefly held by American forces during the Conquest of California while on one trip in July 1846, as he brought cargo to Yerba Buena (modern day San Francisco). The ship he was on was searched, and he made an oath of allegiance to the United States and was released.

==Politics==

Pacheco&#x27;s association with a prominent family in the state helped him to gain support as he entered politics in the 1850s. He was also well respected by Anglos coming into the area. Early in his political career in the 1850s, he was a Democrat. He became affiliated with the National Union Party in the 1860s, but was elected to most of his positions as a candidate for the Republican Party.

In 1853, at age 22, Pacheco successfully sought the position of Judge in San Luis Obispo County. Pacheco was elected to the State Senate in 1857, succeeded his cousin Pablo de la Guerra. At 27 years old, he was the youngest member of the legislature. He was re-elected two times, serving until 1863. During the American Civil War Pacheco was appointed the rank of brigadier general by Governor Leland Stanford and directed to disarm military companies in the Los Angeles area that were not loyal to the Union.

Pacheco served as State Treasurer from 1863 to 1867, then returned to the State Senate until he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1871. He served as Lieutenant Governor of California under Newton Booth until Booth was elected to the United States Senate in 1873 and took office in 1875. Pacheco then served as Governor from February 27 to December 9, 1875, when Lieutenant Governor William Irwin, winner in the September elections that year, was inaugurated. Pacheco, having been denied the Republican nomination for Governor, instead ran for Lieutenant Governor on the People&#x27;s Independent ticket alongside John Bidwell.

After his brief tenure as governor, Pacheco ran for a U.S. House seat in 1876, defeating incumbent Peter D. Wigginton by just one vote. Wigginton contested the election, eventually forcing Pacheco to leave in 1878 when the House Committee on Elections refused Pacheco&#x27;s certificate of election. Returning to California, he went into business until winning a House seat again in September 1879. He was reelected in 1880.

==Diplomacy and death==

After leaving Congress, Pacheco lived on a cattle ranch in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila for five years until he was appointed as U.S. Minister to various countries in Central America in 1890.

He returned to California in 1893, and he died in Oakland, at the home of his brother-in-law, in 1899. He is buried in Mountain View Cemetery.

==Personal life==
On October 31, 1863, he married Mary McIntire, a 22-year-old playwright. They had three children, Maybella Ramona, Romualdo, and Enrique.

==Legacy==
Pacheco not only was the first Hispanic governor of California, but (as of 2024) the only one in California&#x27;s history as a state. He is also remembered for being the first Latino to represent a state in the U.S. House of Representatives. Latinos had served as non-voting delegates of territories before, but Pacheco was the first Latino member of Congress with full voting rights.

He was the last Hispanic Republican elected to represent California in the U.S. Congress until Mike Garcia was elected to represent the 25th district in a special election in May 2020, although Frank Coombs, whose mother was Mexican, was a Republican U.S. representative from California from 1901 to 1903, and Mexican-American U.S. Representative Matthew G. Martínez switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party on July 27, 2000 and served in Congress as a Republican until his term concluded on January 3, 2001.

<doc id="651185" wikidata="Q575278" url="?curid=651185" title="Inotrope">
<text>An inotrope or inotropic is a drug or any substance that alters the force or energy of muscular contractions. Negatively inotropic agents weaken the force of muscular contractions. Positively inotropic agents increase the strength of muscular contraction.

The term inotropic state is most commonly used in reference to various drugs that affect the strength of contraction of heart muscle. However, it can also refer to pathological conditions. For example, enlarged heart muscle can increase inotropic state, whereas dead heart muscle can decrease it.

==Medical uses==

Both positive and negative inotropes are used in the management of various cardiovascular conditions. The choice of agent depends largely on specific pharmacological effects of individual agents with respect to the condition. One of the most important factors affecting inotropic state is the level of calcium in the cytoplasm of the muscle cell. Positive inotropes usually increase this level, while negative inotropes decrease it. However, not all positive and negative drugs affect calcium release, and, among those that do, the mechanism for manipulating the calcium level can differ from drug to drug.

While it is often recommended that vasopressors are given through a central line due to the risk of local tissue injury if the medication enters the local tissues, they are likely safe when given for less than two hours through good peripheral intravenous catheterization.

==Positive inotropic agents==
By increasing the concentration of intracellular calcium or increasing the sensitivity of receptor proteins to calcium, positive inotropic agents can increase myocardial contractility. Concentrations of intracellular calcium can be increased by increasing influx into the cell or stimulating release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Once in the cell, calcium can pass through one of two channels: the L-type calcium channel (long-lasting) and the T-type calcium channel (transient). These channels respond to voltage changes across the membrane differently: L-type channels respond to higher membrane potentials, open more slowly, and remain open longer than T-type channels.

Because of these properties, L-type channels are important in sustaining an action potential, while T-type channels are important in initiating them.

By increasing intracellular calcium, via the action of the L-type channels, the action potential can be sustained for longer and therefore, contractility increases.

Positive inotropes are used to support cardiac function in conditions such as decompensated congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock, septic shock, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, etc.

Examples of positive inotropic agents include:
* Digoxin
* Berberine
*Calcium
*Calcium sensitisers
**Levosimendan
*Catecholamines
**Dopamine
**Dobutamine
**Dopexamine
**Adrenaline (epinephrine)
**Isoproterenol (isoprenaline)
**Noradrenaline (norepinephrine)
*Angiotensin II
*Eicosanoids
**Prostaglandins
*Phosphodiesterase inhibitors
**Enoximone
**Milrinone
**Amrinone
**Theophylline
*Glucagon
*Insulin

==Negative inotropic agents==
Negative inotropic agents decrease myocardial contractility and are used to decrease cardiac workload in conditions such as angina. While negative inotropism may precipitate or exacerbate heart failure in the short term, certain beta blockers (e.g. carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol) have been believed to reduce long-term morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure.

Examples of negative inotropic agents include:

*Beta blockers
*Non-dihydropyridine Calcium channel blockers
**Diltiazem
**Verapamil

Class IA antiarrhythmics such as
*Quinidine
*Procainamide
*Disopyramide

Class IC antiarrhythmics such as
*Flecainide
*Isovoacangine
*Voacristine

* Bathmotropic
* Dromotropic
* Vasoconstrictors

<text>Carlina is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is distributed from Madeira and the Canary Islands across Europe and northern Africa to Siberia and northwestern China.

Plants of the genus are known commonly as carline thistles.

==Description==
&quot;Carlina&quot; species are very similar to true thistles (genus &quot;Cirsium&quot;) in morphology, and are part of the thistle tribe, Cardueae. Most are biennial herbs, but the genus includes annuals, perennials, shrubs, and dwarf trees, as well. The largest reach about 80 centimeters tall. The stems are upright and branching or unbranched. The whole plant is spiny. The leaves have toothed or lobed blades with spiny edges and sometimes woolly hairs. The flower heads are solitary or borne in inflorescences. The head is hemispherical to bell-shaped and lined with several layers of spiny phyllaries. The outer phyllaries may be very long and leaflike. It contains tubular or funnel-shaped disc florets in shades of yellow or red. The fruit is a hairy cypsela with a plumelike pappus made up of tufts of bristles.

==Taxonomy and relationships==
&quot;Carlina&quot; is closely related to the genus &quot;Atractylis&quot;. Together they are a sister group to the genus &quot;Atractylodes&quot; in the subtribe Carlininae. &quot;Carlina&quot; has been divided into five subgenera: &quot;Carlina&quot;, &quot;Carlowizia&quot;, &quot;Heracantha&quot;, &quot;Lyrolepis&quot;, and &quot;Mitina&quot;.

There are about 28 to 34 species in the genus.
===Etymology===
The genus name honors the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (1500–1558).

==Uses==
&quot;Carlina&quot; species have been used as herbal remedies in European systems of traditional medicine. &quot;C. acaulis&quot; root is known as &quot;Carlinae radix&quot; and is still used medicinally as a diuretic and a treatment for such conditions as skin lesions and rashes, catarrh, and toothache. Most commercial preparations of &quot;Carlinae radix&quot; are not &quot;C. acaulis&quot;, but are in fact adulterated with &quot;C. acanthifolia&quot;, a related species. The essential oil of both species is mostly composed of carlina oxide, an acetylene derivative. The compound has antimicrobial activity. The young flowerhead of &quot;C. acaulis&quot; is also eaten like an artichoke.

<doc id="651196" wikidata="Q3345678" url="?curid=651196" title="Reproducing kernel Hilbert space">
<text>In functional analysis, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is a Hilbert space of functions in which point evaluation is a continuous linear functional. Specifically, a Hilbert space formula_1 of functions from a set formula_2 (to formula_3 or formula_4 ) is an RKHS if, for each formula_5 , there exists a function formula_6 such that for all formula_7 ,

formula_8

The function formula_9 is called the reproducing kernel, and it reproduces the value of formula_10 at formula_11 via the inner product.

An immediate consequence of this property is that convergence in norm implies uniform convergence on any subset of formula_2 on which formula_13 is bounded. However, the converse does not necessarily hold. Often the set formula_2 carries a topology, and formula_13 depends continuously on formula_16, in which case: convergence in norm implies uniform convergence on compact subsets of formula_2.

It is not entirely straightforward to construct natural examples of a Hilbert space which are not an RKHS in a non-trivial fashion. Some examples, however, have been found.

While, formally, &quot;L&quot;2 spaces are defined as Hilbert spaces of equivalence classes of functions, this definition can trivially be extended to a Hilbert space of functions by choosing a (total) function as a representative for each equivalence class. However, no choice of representatives can make this space an RKHS (formula_18 would need to be the non-existent Dirac delta function). However, there are RKHSs in which the norm is an &quot;L&quot;2-norm, such as the space of band-limited functions (see the example below).

An RKHS is associated with a kernel that reproduces every function in the space in the sense that for every formula_11 in the set on which the functions are defined, &quot;evaluation at formula_11&quot; can be performed by taking an inner product with a function determined by the kernel. Such a &quot;reproducing kernel&quot; exists if and only if every evaluation functional is continuous.

The reproducing kernel was first introduced in the 1907 work of Stanisław Zaremba concerning boundary value problems for harmonic and biharmonic functions. James Mercer simultaneously examined functions which satisfy the reproducing property in the theory of integral equations. The idea of the reproducing kernel remained untouched for nearly twenty years until it appeared in the dissertations of Gábor Szegő, Stefan Bergman, and Salomon Bochner. The subject was eventually systematically developed in the early 1950s by Nachman Aronszajn and Stefan Bergman.

These spaces have wide applications, including complex analysis, harmonic analysis, and quantum mechanics. Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are particularly important in the field of statistical learning theory because of the celebrated representer theorem which states that every function in an RKHS that minimises an empirical risk functional can be written as a linear combination of the kernel function evaluated at the training points. This is a practically useful result as it effectively simplifies the empirical risk minimization problem from an infinite dimensional to a finite dimensional optimization problem.

For ease of understanding, we provide the framework for real-valued Hilbert spaces. The theory can be easily extended to spaces of complex-valued functions and hence include the many important examples of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces that are spaces of analytic functions.

==Definition==
Let formula_2 be an arbitrary set and formula_1 a Hilbert space of real-valued functions on formula_2, equipped with pointwise addition and pointwise scalar multiplication. The evaluation functional over the Hilbert space of functions formula_1 is a linear functional that evaluates each function at a point formula_11,

:formula_26

We say that &quot;H&quot; is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space if, for all formula_11 in formula_2, formula_29 is continuous at every formula_10 in formula_1 or, equivalently, if formula_29 is a bounded operator on formula_1, i.e. there exists some formula_34 such that

Although formula_35 is assumed for all formula_5, it might still be the case that formula_37.

While property () is the weakest condition that ensures both the existence of an inner product and the evaluation of every function in formula_1 at every point in the domain, it does not lend itself to easy application in practice. A more intuitive definition of the RKHS can be obtained by observing that this property guarantees that the evaluation functional can be represented by taking the inner product of formula_39 with a function formula_40 in formula_1. This function is the so-called reproducing kernel for the Hilbert space formula_1 from which the RKHS takes its name. More formally, the Riesz representation theorem implies that for all formula_11 in formula_2 there exists a unique element formula_40 of formula_1 with the reproducing property,

Since formula_40 is itself a function defined on formula_2 with values in the field formula_3 (or formula_4 in the case of complex Hilbert spaces) and as formula_40 is in formula_1 we have that
:formula_53
where formula_54 is the element in formula_1 associated to formula_56.

This allows us to define the reproducing kernel of formula_1 as a function formula_58 (or formula_4 in the complex case) by

:formula_60

From this definition it is easy to see that formula_58 (or formula_4 in the complex case) is both symmetric (resp. conjugate symmetric) and positive definite, i.e.

:formula_63

for every formula_64 The Moore–Aronszajn theorem (see below) is a sort of converse to this: if a function formula_65 satisfies these conditions then there is a Hilbert space of functions on formula_2 for which it is a reproducing kernel.

==Examples==
The simplest example of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is the space formula_67 where formula_2 is a set and formula_69 is the counting measure on formula_2. For formula_16, the reproducing kernel formula_9 is the indicator function of the one point set formula_73.

Nontrivial reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces often involve analytic functions, as we now illustrate by example. Consider the Hilbert space of bandlimited continuous functions formula_1. Fix some cutoff frequency formula_75 and define the Hilbert space

:formula_76

where formula_77 is the set of square integrable functions, and formula_78 is the Fourier transform of formula_79. As the inner product, we use

: formula_80

Since this is a closed subspace of formula_81, it is a Hilbert space. Moreover, the elements of formula_1 are smooth functions on formula_83 that tend to zero at infinity, essentially by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma. In fact, the elements of formula_1 are the restrictions to formula_83 of entire holomorphic functions, by the Paley–Wiener theorem.

From the Fourier inversion theorem, we have

:formula_86

It then follows by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and Plancherel&#x27;s theorem that, for all formula_11,

:formula_88

This inequality shows that the evaluation functional is bounded, proving that formula_89 is indeed a RKHS.

The kernel function formula_9 in this case is given by

:formula_91

The Fourier transform of formula_92 defined above is given by

:formula_93

which is a consequence of the time-shifting property of the Fourier transform. Consequently, using Plancherel&#x27;s theorem, we have

:formula_94

Thus we obtain the reproducing property of the kernel.

formula_9 in this case is the &quot;bandlimited version&quot; of the Dirac delta function, and that formula_92 converges to formula_97 in the weak sense as the cutoff frequency formula_98 tends to infinity.

== Moore–Aronszajn theorem ==
We have seen how a reproducing kernel Hilbert space defines a reproducing kernel function that is both symmetric and positive definite. The Moore–Aronszajn theorem goes in the other direction; it states that every symmetric, positive definite kernel defines a unique reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The theorem first appeared in Aronszajn&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Reproducing Kernels&quot;, although he attributes it to E. H. Moore.

:Theorem. Suppose &quot;K&quot; is a symmetric, positive definite kernel on a set &quot;X&quot;. Then there is a unique Hilbert space of functions on &quot;X&quot; for which &quot;K&quot; is a reproducing kernel.

Proof. For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, define &quot;Kx&quot; = &quot;K&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, ⋅ ). Let &quot;H&quot;0 be the linear span of {&quot;Kx&quot; : &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;}. Define an inner product on &quot;H&quot;0 by

:formula_99

which implies formula_100.
The symmetry of this inner product follows from the symmetry of &quot;K&quot; and the non-degeneracy follows from the fact that &quot;K&quot; is positive definite.

Let &quot;H&quot; be the completion of &quot;H&quot;0 with respect to this inner product. Then &quot;H&quot; consists of functions of the form

:formula_101

Now we can check the reproducing property ():

:formula_102

To prove uniqueness, let &quot;G&quot; be another Hilbert space of functions for which &quot;K&quot; is a reproducing kernel. For every &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, () implies that

:formula_103

By linearity, formula_104 on the span of formula_105. Then formula_106 because &quot;G&quot; is complete and contains &quot;H&quot;0 and hence contains its completion.

Now we need to prove that every element of &quot;G&quot; is in &quot;H&quot;. Let formula_39 be an element of &quot;G&quot;. Since &quot;H&quot; is a closed subspace of &quot;G&quot;, we can write formula_108 where formula_109 and formula_110. Now if formula_111 then, since &quot;K&quot; is a reproducing kernel of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;:

:formula_112

where we have used the fact that formula_40 belongs to &quot;H&quot; so that its inner product with formula_114 in &quot;G&quot; is zero.
This shows that formula_115 in &quot;G&quot; and concludes the proof.

==Integral operators and Mercer&#x27;s theorem==
We may characterize a symmetric positive definite kernel formula_65 via the integral operator using Mercer&#x27;s theorem and obtain an additional view of the RKHS. Let formula_2 be a compact space equipped with a strictly positive finite Borel measure formula_69 and formula_119 a continuous, symmetric, and positive definite function. Define the integral operator formula_120 as

:formula_121

where formula_122 is the space of square integrable functions with respect to formula_123.

Mercer&#x27;s theorem states that the spectral decomposition of the integral operator formula_124 of formula_65 yields a series representation of formula_65 in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of formula_127. This then implies that formula_65 is a reproducing kernel so that the corresponding RKHS can be defined in terms of these eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We provide the details below.

Under these assumptions formula_124 is a compact, continuous, self-adjoint, and positive operator. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators implies that there is an at most countable decreasing sequence formula_130 such that formula_131 and
formula_132, where the formula_133 form an orthonormal basis of formula_122. By the positivity of formula_135 for all formula_136 One can also show that formula_137 maps continuously into the space of continuous functions formula_138 and therefore we may choose continuous functions as the eigenvectors, that is, formula_139 for all formula_136 Then by Mercer&#x27;s theorem formula_141 may be written in terms of the eigenvalues and continuous eigenfunctions as

:formula_142

for all formula_143 such that

:formula_144

This above series representation is referred to as a Mercer kernel or Mercer representation of formula_141.

Furthermore, it can be shown that the RKHS formula_89 of formula_141 is given by

:formula_148

where the inner product of formula_89 given by

:formula_150

This representation of the RKHS has application in probability and statistics, for example to the Karhunen-Loève representation for stochastic processes and kernel PCA.

==Feature maps==
A feature map is a map formula_151, where formula_152 is a Hilbert space which we will call the feature space. The first sections presented the connection between bounded/continuous evaluation functions, positive definite functions, and integral operators and in this section we provide another representation of the RKHS in terms of feature maps.

Every feature map defines a kernel via

Clearly formula_141 is symmetric and positive definiteness follows from the properties of inner product in formula_152. Conversely, every positive definite function and corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space has infinitely many associated feature maps such that () holds.

For example, we can trivially take formula_155 and formula_156 for all formula_111. Then () is satisfied by the reproducing property. Another classical example of a feature map relates to the previous section regarding integral operators by taking formula_158 and formula_159.

This connection between kernels and feature maps provides us with a new way to understand positive definite functions and hence reproducing kernels as inner products in formula_89. Moreover, every feature map can naturally define a RKHS by means of the definition of a positive definite function.

Lastly, feature maps allow us to construct function spaces that reveal another perspective on the RKHS. Consider the linear space

:formula_161

We can define a norm on formula_162 by

:formula_163

It can be shown that formula_164 is a RKHS with kernel defined by formula_165. This representation implies that the elements of the RKHS are inner products of elements in the feature space and can accordingly be seen as hyperplanes. This view of the RKHS is related to the kernel trick in machine learning.

==Properties==

Useful properties of RKHSs:

* Let formula_166 be a sequence of sets and formula_167 be a collection of corresponding positive definite functions on formula_168 It then follows that
*::formula_169
*:is a kernel on formula_170
* Let formula_171 then the restriction of formula_141 to formula_173 is also a reproducing kernel.
* Consider a normalized kernel formula_65 such that formula_175 for all formula_176. Define a pseudo-metric on X as
*::formula_177
*:By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality,
*::formula_178
*:This inequality allows us to view formula_65 as a measure of similarity between inputs. If formula_143 are similar then formula_181 will be closer to 1 while if formula_182 are dissimilar then formula_181 will be closer to 0.

*The closure of the span of formula_184 coincides with formula_89.

== Common examples ==

===Bilinear kernels===
:formula_186
The RKHS formula_1 corresponding to this kernel is the dual space, consisting of functions formula_188 satisfying formula_189.

===Polynomial kernels===
:formula_190

===Radial basis function kernels===
These are another common class of kernels which satisfy formula_191. Some examples include:

*Gaussian or squared exponential kernel:
*::formula_192
* Laplacian kernel:
*::formula_193
*:The squared norm of a function formula_10 in the RKHS formula_1 with this kernel is:
*::formula_196

===Bergman kernels===

We also provide examples of Bergman kernels. Let &quot;X&quot; be finite and let &quot;H&quot; consist of all complex-valued functions on &quot;X&quot;. Then an element of &quot;H&quot; can be represented as an array of complex numbers. If the usual inner product is used, then &quot;Kx&quot; is the function whose value is 1 at &quot;x&quot; and 0 everywhere else, and formula_181 can be thought of as an identity matrix since

:formula_198

In this case, &quot;H&quot; is isomorphic to formula_199.

The case of formula_200 (where formula_201 denotes the unit disc) is more sophisticated. Here the Bergman space formula_202 is the space of square-integrable holomorphic functions on formula_201. It can be shown that the reproducing kernel for formula_202 is

:formula_205

Lastly, the space of band limited functions in formula_206 with bandwidth formula_207 is a RKHS with reproducing kernel

:formula_208

== Extension to vector-valued functions==
In this section we extend the definition of the RKHS to spaces of vector-valued functions as this extension is particularly important in multi-task learning and manifold regularization. The main difference is that the reproducing kernel formula_209 is a symmetric function that is now a positive semi-definite &quot;matrix&quot; for every formula_210 in formula_211. More formally, we define a vector-valued RKHS (vvRKHS) as a Hilbert space of functions formula_212 such that for all formula_213 and formula_111

:formula_215

and

:formula_216

This second property parallels the reproducing property for the scalar-valued case. This definition can also be connected to integral operators, bounded evaluation functions, and feature maps as we saw for the scalar-valued RKHS. We can equivalently define the vvRKHS as a vector-valued Hilbert space with a bounded evaluation functional and show that this implies the existence of a unique reproducing kernel by the Riesz Representation theorem. Mercer&#x27;s theorem can also be extended to address the vector-valued setting and we can therefore obtain a feature map view of the vvRKHS. Lastly, it can also be shown that the closure of the span of formula_217 coincides with formula_89, another property similar to the scalar-valued case.

We can gain intuition for the vvRKHS by taking a component-wise perspective on these spaces. In particular, we find that every vvRKHS is isometrically isomorphic to a scalar-valued RKHS on a particular input space. Let formula_219. Consider the space formula_220 and the corresponding reproducing kernel

As noted above, the RKHS associated to this reproducing kernel is given by the closure of the span of formula_221 where 
formula_222 for every set of pairs 

The connection to the scalar-valued RKHS can then be made by the fact that every matrix-valued kernel can be identified with a kernel of the form of () via

:formula_223

Moreover, every kernel with the form of () defines a matrix-valued kernel with the above expression. Now letting the map formula_224 be defined as

:formula_225

where formula_226 is the formula_227 component of the canonical basis for formula_228, one can show that formula_229 is bijective and an isometry between formula_230 and formula_231.

While this view of the vvRKHS can be useful in multi-task learning, this isometry does not reduce the study of the vector-valued case to that of the scalar-valued case. In fact, this isometry procedure can make both the scalar-valued kernel and the input space too difficult to work with in practice as properties of the original kernels are often lost.

An important class of matrix-valued reproducing kernels are &quot;separable&quot; kernels which can factorized as the product of a scalar valued kernel and a formula_232-dimensional symmetric positive semi-definite matrix. In light of our previous discussion these kernels are of the form

:formula_233

for all formula_234 in formula_211 and formula_236 in formula_237. As the scalar-valued kernel encodes dependencies between the inputs, we can observe that the matrix-valued kernel encodes dependencies among both the inputs and the outputs.

We lastly remark that the above theory can be further extended to spaces of functions with values in function spaces but obtaining kernels for these spaces is a more difficult task.

== Connection between RKHSs and the ReLU function ==
The ReLU function is commonly defined as formula_238 and is a mainstay in the architecture of neural networks where it is used as an activation function. One can construct a ReLU-like nonlinear function using the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Below, we derive this construction and show how it implies the representation power of neural networks with ReLU activations. 

We will work with the Hilbert space formula_239 of absolutely continuous functions with formula_240 and square integrable (i.e. formula_241) derivative. It has the inner product 

: formula_242

To construct the reproducing kernel it suffices to consider a dense subspace, so let formula_243 and formula_244. 
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus then gives 

: formula_245

where

:formula_246 

and formula_247 i.e.

:formula_248

This implies formula_249 reproduces formula_10.

Moreover the minimum function on formula_251 has the following representations with the ReLu function: 

: formula_252

Using this formulation, we can apply the representer theorem to the RKHS, letting one prove the optimality of using ReLU activations in neural network settings.
