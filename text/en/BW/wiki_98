<text>Quantum optics is a branch of atomic, molecular, and optical physics and quantum chemistry dealing with how individual quanta of light, known as photons, interact with atoms and molecules. It includes the study of the particle-like properties of photons. Photons have been used to test many of the counter-intuitive predictions of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement and teleportation, and are a useful resource for quantum information processing.

== History ==
Light propagating in a restricted volume of space has its energy and momentum quantized according to an integer number of particles known as photons. Quantum optics studies the nature and effects of light as quantized photons. The first major development leading to that understanding was the correct modeling of the blackbody radiation spectrum by Max Planck in 1899 under the hypothesis of light being emitted in discrete units of energy. The photoelectric effect was further evidence of this quantization as explained by Albert Einstein in a 1905 paper, a discovery for which he was to be awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. Niels Bohr showed that the hypothesis of optical radiation being quantized corresponded to his theory of the quantized energy levels of atoms, and the spectrum of discharge emission from hydrogen in particular. The understanding of the interaction between light and matter following these developments was crucial for the development of quantum mechanics as a whole. However, the subfields of quantum mechanics dealing with matter-light interaction were principally regarded as research into matter rather than into light; hence one rather spoke of atom physics and quantum electronics in 1960. Laser science—i.e., research into principles, design and application of these devices—became an important field, and the quantum mechanics underlying the laser&#x27;s principles was studied now with more emphasis on the properties of light, and the name &quot;quantum optics&quot; became customary.

As laser science needed good theoretical foundations, and also because research into these soon proved very fruitful, interest in quantum optics rose. Following the work of Dirac in quantum field theory, John R. Klauder, George Sudarshan, Roy J. Glauber, and Leonard Mandel applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the statistics of light (see degree of coherence). This led to the introduction of the coherent state as a concept that addressed variations between laser light, thermal light, exotic squeezed states, etc. as it became understood that light cannot be fully described just referring to the electromagnetic fields describing the waves in the classical picture. In 1977, Kimble et al. demonstrated a single atom emitting one photon at a time, further compelling evidence that light consists of photons. Previously unknown quantum states of light with characteristics unlike classical states, such as squeezed light were subsequently discovered.

Development of short and ultrashort laser pulses—created by Q switching and modelocking techniques—opened the way to the study of what became known as ultrafast processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. Raman spectroscopy) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an optical trap or optical tweezers by laser beam. This, along with Doppler cooling and Sisyphus cooling, was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated Bose–Einstein condensation.

Other remarkable results are the demonstration of quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, and quantum logic gates. The latter are of much interest in quantum information theory, a subject that partly emerged from quantum optics, partly from theoretical computer science.

Today&#x27;s fields of interest among quantum optics researchers include parametric down-conversion, parametric oscillation, even shorter (attosecond) light pulses, use of quantum optics for quantum information, manipulation of single atoms, Bose–Einstein condensates, their application, and how to manipulate them (a sub-field often called atom optics), coherent perfect absorbers, and much more. Topics classified under the term of quantum optics, especially as applied to engineering and technological innovation, often go under the modern term photonics.

Several Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work in quantum optics. These were awarded:
* in 2022, Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger &quot;for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science&quot;.
* in 2012, Serge Haroche and David J. Wineland &quot;for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring &amp; manipulation of individual quantum systems&quot;.
* in 2005, Theodor W. Hänsch, Roy J. Glauber and John L. Hall
* in 2001, Wolfgang Ketterle, Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman
* in 1997, Steven Chu, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and William Daniel Phillips for laser cooling

== Concepts ==
According to quantum theory, light may be considered not only to be as an electro-magnetic wave but also as a &quot;stream&quot; of particles called photons, which travel with &quot;c&quot;, the speed of light in vacuum. These particles should not be considered to be classical billiard balls, but as quantum mechanical particles described by a wavefunction spread over a finite region.

Each particle carries one quantum of energy, equal to &quot;hf&quot;, where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant and &quot;f&quot; is the frequency of the light. That energy possessed by a single photon corresponds exactly to the transition between discrete energy levels in an atom (or other system) that emitted the photon; material absorption of a photon is the reverse process. Einstein&#x27;s explanation of spontaneous emission also predicted the existence of stimulated emission, the principle upon which the laser rests. However, the actual invention of the maser (and laser) many years later was dependent on a method to produce a population inversion.

The use of statistical mechanics is fundamental to the concepts of quantum optics: light is described in terms of field operators for creation and annihilation of photons—i.e. in the language of quantum electrodynamics.

A frequently encountered state of the light field is the coherent state, as introduced by E.C. George Sudarshan in 1960. This state, which can be used to approximately describe the output of a single-frequency laser well above the laser threshold, exhibits Poissonian photon number statistics. Via certain nonlinear interactions, a coherent state can be transformed into a squeezed coherent state, by applying a squeezing operator that can exhibit super- or sub-Poissonian photon statistics. Such light is called squeezed light. Other important quantum aspects are related to correlations of photon statistics between different beams. For example, spontaneous parametric down-conversion can generate so-called &#x27;twin beams&#x27;, where (ideally) each photon of one beam is associated with a photon in the other beam.

Atoms are considered as quantum mechanical oscillators with a discrete energy spectrum, with the transitions between the energy eigenstates being driven by the absorption or emission of light according to Einstein&#x27;s theory.

For solid state matter, one uses the energy band models of solid state physics. This is important for understanding how light is detected by solid-state devices, commonly used in experiments.

== Quantum electronics ==
Quantum electronics is a term that was used mainly between the 1950s and 1970s to denote the area of physics dealing with the effects of quantum mechanics on the behavior of electrons in matter, together with their interactions with photons. Today, it is rarely considered a sub-field in its own right, and it has been absorbed by other fields. Solid state physics regularly takes quantum mechanics into account, and is usually concerned with electrons. Specific applications of quantum mechanics in electronics is researched within semiconductor physics. The term also encompassed the basic processes of laser operation, which is today studied as a topic in quantum optics. Usage of the term overlapped early work on the quantum Hall effect and quantum cellular automata.

<doc id="658957" wikidata="Q3795648" url="?curid=658957" title="The Reverse of the Medal">
<text>The Reverse of the Medal is the eleventh historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1986. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.

Returning from the far side of the world, Aubrey meets his unknown son, and proceeds home to England, where he is embroiled in the most difficult challenge of his career, and all on dry land. Maturin is his close and valuable friend at every hard reverse.

This novel was read by Starling Lawrence of American publisher W W Norton in 1989. By fall of 1990, W W Norton began publishing paperbacks of the prior novels, at the urging of Mr Lawrence, thus introducing the series to a new and larger audience.

==Plot summary==

Jack Aubrey and his crew make their way in a much knocked-about &quot;Surprise&quot; from the small island near the equator in the Pacific Ocean to the West Indies Squadron at Bridgetown with their American prisoners in a recaptured whaler. Aubrey learns that Sally Mputa was pregnant when they parted over twenty years earlier, at the moment of meeting his grown son, Samuel Panda, who appears to meet him and seek his blessing. Samuel is on his way to the with Catholic missionaries. Aubrey and Maturin like the young man, and Maturin promises to aid him in his wish to become a priest, as his being illegitimate is a barrier to taking orders. After the court martial for the British mutineers among Aubrey&#x27;s prisoners, Aubrey leaves quickly for home. The voyage home is enlivened by a chase of the privateer &quot;Spartan&quot;, which slips away in fog through the blockade to Brest.
Finally ashore in England, Aubrey hears a rumour from a stranger he meets in Dover that peace is coming soon, creating an opportunity to make money in the stock exchange. Mr Palmer claims familiarity with Maturin. Aubrey makes the transactions, and shares the advice with his father, General Aubrey. The General makes large stock transactions and spreads the rumour of peace farther. The transactions prove profitable in the short term, but values fall when the rumour is shown to be false. Aubrey does not sell quickly enough and loses money, though others prosper. Aubrey is arrested for manipulating the market. He is taken to the Marshalsea prison to await trial. General Aubrey flees, leaving his son to fend for himself.

Maturin finds that his wife Diana has gone to Sweden with Jagiello, and that The Grapes, an Inn in the liberties of the Savoy where he has kept rooms for years, has burnt down. Maturin shows Sir Joseph Blaine the brass box full of valuable paper from &quot;Danaë&quot; and he makes a list of the contents; Blaine will watch to see who tries to cash any of it. Maturin then gives the box to Wray at the Admiralty. Maturin learns that his godfather Ramon d&#x27;Ullastret has died, and left him sole heir to an enormous fortune. Pained by the absence of his wife, Maturin returns to the use of laudanum.

Maturin and Blaine find an attorney and an investigator to defend Aubrey from the charges against him at his trial. Maturin advertises a large reward (the gambling debts paid back to him by Wray) for word of Mr Palmer, which proves an error. Palmer is found murdered and mutilated, thus useless for Aubrey&#x27;s defense. Aubrey, who is unfamiliar with politically motivated trials, expresses confidence in British justice. His career is at stake, but he remains calm, even stoic, accepting the help Maturin gives him, and his wife&#x27;s support. The trial is completed in two days, one day going on without rest for eighteen hours. The judge, Lord Quinborough, and jury convict him. The punishment is a fine of £2,500 and one hour on the pillory. His name is stricken from the Navy List, not by law but by practice, the worst blow. The pillory is delayed a few days, so word spreads to all his mates. The public square is filled with seamen, who in a display of their support for a beloved and respected captain, push away anyone come to throw stones.

On the day before the trial begins, the &quot;Surprise&quot; is put up for auction. Maturin, with the aid of Tom Pullings, makes the successful bid. With Blaine&#x27;s aid, Maturin obtains letters of marque so she can operate as a private man-of-war. Aubrey takes &quot;Surprise&quot; out immediately. Blaine tells Maturin that there is interest in a mission to Chile, and that Maturin is the preferred agent. Maturin receives a message to meet someone who mentions the Blue Peter, the diamond that Diana gave up to gain Maturin&#x27;s release in France. He again meets M. Duhamel, who returns the diamond, as was long ago agreed, and supplies Maturin with information on the double agents in London. Duhamel knew the late Palmer only by that alias, and the pair in government is Ledward and Andrew Wray, who also mounted the stock exchange fraud. Maturin is chagrined when he realizes what he did not understand in Malta when dealing with Wray. In return, Duhamel wants to leave Europe for Canada, as he is tired of the war. Maturin arranges for him to sail on HMS &quot;Eurydice&quot; under Captain Dundas, leaving in a few days. As proof, Maturin watches as Duhamel gives money in exchange for an information packet from Ledward and Wray. Maturin seeks Blaine to share with him this vital information.

==Series chronology==

This novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the fifth of eleven novels (beginning with &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;) that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series). The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.

==Reviews==

This novel is the one read by Starling Lawrence of W W Norton, after urging by his cousin in 1986 and then visiting the London office of Vivien Green in 1989, the literary agent for Patrick O&#x27;Brian. He picked up a copy of this novel, read it and liked it. By fall of 1990. W W Norton began issuing paperbacks of the earlier novels, which is a distinctly positive review of &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot;. 

==Allusion to real events and persons==

O&#x27;Brian bases the story of the stock exchange fraud and many of the details of Captain Aubrey&#x27;s trial on the experiences of Thomas Cochrane, Lord Cochrane. In the Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814, Lord Cochrane was tried before Lord Ellenborough at the Guildhall and similarly convicted. Lord Cochrane was sentenced to prison, the pillory and fined £1,000. The pillory portion of Cochrane&#x27;s sentence was rescinded, for fear of a public backlash.

By contrast, in the novel, the pillory sentence is carried out, but there is no prison time, so that Aubrey will be free to be a privateer, captain of a letter of marque, in a mission that government wants Maturin to carry out. The pillory scene is an opportunity for the seamen, including officers, to show their support of Aubrey, protecting him from Wray&#x27;s never-ending wrath.

According to O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot;, Lord Cochrane and his defendants always passionately maintained that he was &quot;not&quot; guilty and that Lord Ellenborough&#x27;s conduct of the trial was grossly unfair. Lord Ellenborough and his descendants, however, took the opposite view. One of Lord Ellenborough&#x27;s descendants (not named in the &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot;) wrote again about the trial, asking a Mr Attlay (sic) of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn to address the legal issues. The title or year of the book is not mentioned in the &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot;, but is the source to which Patrick O&#x27;Brian referred for describing &quot;the structure and the curious timetable&quot; of the original trial, for Jack Aubrey&#x27;s trial in the novel. The book and author are &quot;The trial of Lord Cochrane before Lord Ellenborough&quot; by J.B. Atlay, London 1897.

==Adaptations==

In July 2009, Russell Crowe told the Associated Press that this book would make up the bulk of a second &quot;Master and Commander&quot; film. As of July 2014, no second film has been produced. At the time of Crowe&#x27;s comment, there was no word on a director or cast.

The paperback reissue by W W Norton in the USA in 1992 marked a resurgence in interest in the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian. Starling Lawrence of that publishing house discovered the novels in 1989, and proceeded to reissue all earlier novels, and then publish following novels in the US when HarperCollins published in the UK. Norton issued &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot; six years after its initial publication, as a paperback in 1992. Ironically, it was a US publisher, J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., who asked O&#x27;Brian to write the first book in the series, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; published in 1969. Collins picked it up in the UK, and continued to publish each novel as O&#x27;Brian completed another story. Beginning with &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot; in 1991, the novels were released at about the same time in the USA (by W W Norton) and the UK (by HarperCollins, the name of Collins after a merger).

Novels prior to 1992 were published rapidly in the US for that new market. Following novels were released at the same time by the UK and US publishers. Collins asked Geoff Hunt in 1988 to do the cover art for the twelve books published by then, with &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; being the first book to have Hunt&#x27;s work on the first edition. He continued to paint the covers for future books; the covers were used on both USA and UK editions. Reissues of earlier novels used the Geoff Hunt covers.

<text>Michael Hartley Freedman (born April 21, 1951) is an American mathematician at Microsoft Station Q, a research group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1986, he was awarded a Fields Medal for his work on the 4-dimensional generalized Poincaré conjecture. Freedman and Robion Kirby showed that an exotic [[Michael Freedman|R]]4 manifold exists.

==Life and career==
Freedman was born in Los Angeles, California, in the United States. His father, Benedict Freedman, was an American Jewish aeronautical engineer, musician, writer, and mathematician. His mother, Nancy Mars Freedman, performed as an actress and also trained as an artist. His parents cowrote a series of novels together. He entered the University of California, Berkeley, but dropped out after two semesters. In the same year he wrote a letter to Ralph Fox, a Princeton University professor at the time, and was admitted to the university&#x27;s graduate school, where in 1968 he continued his studies and received a Ph.D. in 1973 for his doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Codimension-Two Surgery&quot;, written under the supervision of William Browder. After graduating, Freedman returned to Berkeley, where he was a lecturer in the department of mathematics until 1975. He left Berkeley to become a member of the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton. In 1976 he was appointed assistant professor in the department of mathematics at the University of California, San Diego. He spent the year 1980/81 at IAS, then returned to UCSD, where in 1982 he was promoted to professor. He was appointed the Charles Lee Powell chair of mathematics at UCSD in 1985.

Freedman has received numerous awards and honors including Sloan and Guggenheim Fellowships, a MacArthur Fellowship, and the National Medal of Science. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the American Mathematical Society. In addition to winning a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1986 in Berkeley, he was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1983 in Warsaw and at the ICM in 1998 in Berlin. He currently works at Microsoft Station Q at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where his team is involved in the development of the topological quantum computer.

<doc id="658974" wikidata="Q3823329" url="?curid=658974" title="The Letter of Marque">
<text>The Letter of Marque is the twelfth historical novel in the Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1988. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.

Aubrey faces life off the Navy List, as the captain of a letter of marque, finding heart to endure and train yet another ship&#x27;s crew, but of volunteers, with no Marines aboard. Maturin travels to meet his wife.

This novel received strongly positive reviews, for the characterizations and the naval actions. &quot;O&#x27;Brian is a brilliant stylist of sea-historicals&quot; in this &quot;authentic and engaging&quot; novel. The two principal characters, &quot;bluff, hearty Aubrey and reedy, intellectual Maturin&quot;, return for an exciting story with accurate historical depictions. &quot;Jack&#x27;s seamanship and heroism are complemented by Stephen&#x27;s absent-minded brilliance . . . in this swift, witty tale of money and love.&quot; Richard Snow called it a &quot;self-contained and satisfying story.&quot;

==Plot summary==
Jack Aubrey, now a civilian, prepares the &quot;Surprise&quot; to sail as a letter of marque. The loss of his place on the Navy list is the hardest blow. He is stoic, but appears harsh to his new crew. His reputation brings him a full crew, and he takes the men on liking. He runs the &quot;Surprise&quot; on Royal Navy lines, including regular pay to the men, in addition to any prizes they might take. He is supported by his crew of old Surprises, privateers and smugglers, the latter groups recruited in Shelmerston, on the western coast of England. It is let out that a group of his friends purchased the ship at the auction, as Stephen Maturin, who is the sole owner, wants to play his same role of surgeon and natural philosopher on the ship. Aubrey takes the new crew on a short cruise in the Atlantic, which proves unexpectedly profitable.

The downfall of the traitors Wray and Ledward restores order in British intelligence circles, returning Sir Joseph Blaine to his position in the Admiralty. The traitors fled England, so they still have a friend in the government. Duhamel, the French agent who gave them away, never did reach Canada, as he died in a fall boarding &quot;Eurydice&quot;. Blaine says it will be difficult to restore Aubrey to the Navy, even with solid evidence left behind by Wray showing how he profited in the stock market scheme and set Aubrey up. Maturin&#x27;s servant Padeen becomes a secret laudanum addict after a painful burn, where he learned its benefit, followed by an infected painful tooth that Maturin could not treat. Padeen dilutes the ship&#x27;s supply with brandy. Maturin is thus unknowingly weaned off his own addiction.

During the short cruise, the &quot;Surprise&quot; captures the &quot;Merlin&quot;, the consort of the &quot;Spartan&quot;. They learn that American/French privateer &quot;Spartan&quot; seeks its next quarry, the Spanish barque &quot;Azul&quot; with quicksilver aboard. &quot;Surprise&quot; sails to intercept them. &quot;Azul&quot; is struck on rocks, with &quot;Spartan&quot; adjacent following a fierce battle between the two; &quot;Surprise&quot; meets them and boards first &quot;Azul&quot; and then &quot;Spartan&quot;. Aubrey then tricks the &quot;Spartan&#x27;s&quot; five prizes out of Horta harbour, making him and his crew wealthy, improving his reputation, and earning him a gift of silver plate from the merchants who had been so harried by &quot;Spartan&quot;. Blaine tells Maturin of the frigate &quot;Diane&quot;, a French navy ship ready to voyage to South America. Aubrey plans the attack at night in ship&#x27;s boats, cooperating with the Navy, specifically William Babbington of HMS &quot;Tartarus&quot;, who has made post Captain, thus removing pressure on him to take credit for success. &quot;Surprise&quot; takes the &quot;Diane&quot; and all other vessels in the French port of Saint Martin the night before &quot;Diane&quot; plans to sail. Maturin imprisons the intelligence agent aboard, taking his papers, but the agent slips away dressed as a woman. In the short clash on the &quot;Diane&quot;, Maturin kills her captain while Aubrey is wounded by a bullet near his spine. The second success makes Aubrey a popular hero. 

When offered the opportunity to request a free pardon, he angrily declines on the grounds that he is innocent. Aubrey&#x27;s father, a fugitive since his part in the stock-jobbing affair, is found dead in a ditch. Aubrey organizes the funeral for him, which takes him to his boyhood home of Woolcombe, now his by inheritance. After the funeral, Edward Norton (a friend of Aubrey&#x27;s grandfather) offers Aubrey a seat in Parliament, from the borough of Milport. This gain in position leads Lord Melville, First Lord of the Admiralty, to assure Aubrey of his restoration. Aubrey is a changed man.

Maturin travels to Sweden to speak to his wife Diana Villiers. Aubrey agrees to meet him there for the return voyage. In Stockholm, Maturin purchases a bottle of full-strength laudanum and some coca leaves from a well-stocked apothecary. He meets Diana near her home in Stockholm. He learns Wray lied about not finding Diana in London to deliver the letter; she saw Wray, and no letter was given her. Maturin explains why he was seen with Laura Fielding. Villiers assures him she has not been unfaithful with Jagiello, who is soon to be married. He gives her the Blue Peter, the diamond she gave up to save him, which pleases her greatly. He tells her of his sudden increase in wealth. Maturin takes two doses of laudanum and becomes disoriented. He is seriously injured in a fall, breaking his leg. Diana nurses him and they are reconciled. &quot;Surprise&quot; returns from a stop in Riga to buy poldavy. Martin tells Maturin that he caught Padeen diluting the laudanum supply with brandy, and that Padeen is addicted and in irons. They carry Maturin out to the ship in style, accompanied by Colonel Jagiello&#x27;s escort, and Diana embarks with him for home.

==Series chronology==
This novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the sixth of eleven novels (beginning with &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;) that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series). The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.

==Continuity==

The events of &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; follow directly from the events of &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot;, the prior novel in the series. In &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot;, Aubrey is found guilty of manipulating the stock exchange. By custom, the finding of guilt puts him off the list of Royal Navy captains, in order by seniority. Further, Maturin&#x27;s godfather died, leaving his fortune to Maturin, who finds the large amount of wealth to change his ways in small things, and in large. The first use of his new wealth is to bid for the ship &quot;Surprise&quot; as the ship is not wanted in Navy service, and like nearly all his efforts, it is meant to help his friend Aubrey survive the blow of the court verdict. Ledward and Wray were exposed as spies for France by Duhamel, who returns the valued diamond, the Blue Peter, to Maturin as was long ago promised. Duhamel is tired of his life in intelligence and wants to retire to Canada, away from this long war. All the Surprises were paid off when the ship was put up for auction, so Aubrey needs to start again with his crew.

==Reviews==

Reviews of this novel in 1990 were enthusiastic and specific as to the most valued aspects of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s writing.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; finds the novel &quot;authentic and engaging&quot;, and O&#x27;Brian &quot;a brilliant stylist of sea-historicals&quot;. The personal worries of Aubrey (his family&#x27;s finances are in shambles at the start) and Maturin (who wants to win back his estranged wife) &quot;add fiber to the characterizations&quot;. This review notes Aubrey&#x27;s triumph over the French in taking their frigate and all ships in one harbor, and his deceptions for the enemy. As to O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s writing, they found &quot;his every sentence sensuous and emerging from saltwater as naturally as the leap of a flying fish.&quot;

&quot;Library Journal&quot; finds this long-awaited sequel (in the US) to be an &quot;exciting sea story with good character development.&quot; O&#x27;Brian &quot;created two wonderfully contrasting characters in bluff, hearty Aubrey and reedy, intellectual Maturin.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; finds this a &quot;swift, witty tale of money and love.&quot; They proffer the notion that &quot;If Jane Austen wrote Royal Navy yarns, they might read like this&quot; novel. The writing evokes the period both as to manner of speech and the life aboard ship in the early 19th century.

Richard Snow cites a scene in this novel when the two seek and find the &quot;true line&quot; of a piece by Mozart as illustrating that the &quot;only intellectual common ground the friendship enjoys is the mutual love of music&quot; in an article about the re-issue of the series by W W Norton. Their understanding of each other is &quot;warm and instinctual&quot; and he goes on to say that, &quot;On the foundations of this friendship, O&#x27;Brian reconstructs a civilization.&quot; He found this novel to be a &quot;self-contained and satisfying story.&quot;

==Allusions to science and history==
Whilst in Stockholm, Stephen Maturin visits an apothecary&#x27;s shop to buy laudanum. He inquires about the coca or cuca leaf from Peru, which he learned about in a previous mission, detailed in &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot; and the apothecary replies, &quot;It is said to dissolve the gross humours and do away with appetite.&quot; Maturin buys a pound and the coca leaf eventually comes to replace his opium habit in later novels. He carries the leaves in a pouch and lime in a small silver box. When he feels the need for it, he rolls the leaves into a ball and pops them into his cheek with lime.

The book also discusses the nascent science of ballooning, contrasting hot air and gaseous balloons and with many descriptions thereof. Stephen has an extended dream sequence, while recovering from his fall, involving a balloon and his wife.

Aubrey wanted to be in Riga to get poldavy, which was a coarse canvas favoured for making sails.

==Allusion to real events==
Ships in private ownership were privateers, doing some of the tasks of a national navy vessel. For permission to take enemy ships with full authority, the government issues a letter of marque. That is a legal document from the British government which gives the private vessel the right to capture ships from enemy nations.

In August 1990, &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; was the first of the series novels to be issued by W W Norton in hardback and in paperback in the US, two years after the first edition was published in the UK, and it was an instant success. This drew a new, large audience to the series, and new attention to the author, as well as positive reviews such as in &quot;Library Journal&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, and one by Richard Snow in the &quot;New York Times&quot; shown above. Novels prior to this were published rapidly in the US for that new market. Following novels were released at the same time by the UK and US publishers. Collins (name of UK publisher in that year) asked Geoff Hunt in 1988 to do the cover art for the twelve books published by then, with &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; being the first book to have Hunt&#x27;s work on the first edition. He continued to paint the covers for future books; the covers were used on both USA and UK editions. Reissues of earlier novels used the Geoff Hunt covers.

<text>Kents Cavern is a cave system in Torquay, Devon, England. It is notable both for its archaeological and geological features (as a karst feature in the Devonian limestone). The cave system is open to the public and has been a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1952 and a Scheduled Ancient Monument since 1957.

==Prehistory==
The caverns and passages were formed in the early Pleistocene period in Devonian limestone by water action and have been occupied by one of at least eight separate, discontinuous native populations to have inhabited the British Isles. The other key paleolithic sites in the UK are Happisburgh, Pakefield, Boxgrove, Swanscombe, Pontnewydd, Paviland, Creswell Crags and Gough&#x27;s Cave.

===Kents Cavern 4===

A prehistoric upper jawbone (maxilla) fragment was discovered in the cavern during a 1927 excavation by the Torquay Natural History Society and named &quot;Kents Cavern 4.&quot; The specimen is on display at the Torquay Museum.

In 1989, the fragment was radiocarbon dated to 36,400–34,700 years BP, but a 2011 study that dated fossils from neighbouring strata produced an estimate of 44,200–41,500 years BP. The same study analysed the dental structure of the fragment and determined it to be &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; rather than &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot;, which would have made it the earliest anatomically modern human fossil yet discovered in northwestern Europe. In a response to this paper in 2012, the authors Mark White and Paul Pettitt wrote, &quot;We urge caution over using a small selected sample of fauna
from an old and poorly executed excavation in Kent&#x27;s Cavern to provide a radiocarbon stratigraphy and age for a human fossil that cannot be dated directly, and we suggest that the recent dating should be rejected.&quot;

==Modern history==

===As an archæological site===

Kents Cavern is first recorded as Kents Hole Close on a 1659 deed when the land was leased to John Black. The earliest evidence of exploration of the caves in historic times is two inscriptions, &quot;William Petre 1571&quot; and &quot;Robert Hedges 1688&quot; engraved on stalagmites. The first recorded excavation was that of Thomas Northmore in 1824. Northmore&#x27;s work attracted the attention of William Buckland, the first Reader in Geology at the University of Oxford, who sent a party including John MacEnery to explore the caves in an attempt to find evidence that Mithras was once worshipped in the area. MacEnery, the Roman Catholic chaplain at Torre Abbey, conducted systematic excavations between 1824 and 1829. When MacEnery reported to the British Association the discovery of flint tools below the stalagmites on the cave floor, his work was derided as contrary to Bishop James Ussher&#x27;s Biblical chronology dating the Creation to 4004 BC.

In September 1845, the recently created Torquay Natural History Society requested permission from Sir Lawrence Palk to explore the caves to obtain fossils and artefacts for the planned Torquay Museum, and as a result, Edward Vivian and William Pengelly were allowed to conduct excavations between 1846 and 1858. Vivian reported to the Geological Society in 1847, but at the time, it was generally believed that early humans had entered the caves long after the formation of the cave structures examined. This changed when, in the Autumn of 1859, following the work of Pengelly at the Brixham Cavern and of Jacques de Perthes in France, the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries, and the British Association agreed that the excavations had established the antiquity of humanity.
In 1865, the British Association created a committee, led by Pengelly, to fully explore the cave system over the course of fifteen years. It was Pengelly&#x27;s party that discovered Robert Hedges&#x27; stalagmite inscription, and from the stalagmite&#x27;s growth since that time deduced that human-created artefacts found under the formation could be half a million years old. Pengelly plotted the position of every bone, flint, and other artefact he discovered during the excavations and afterward continued working with the Torquay Natural History Society until his death in 1892 at his home less than 2 km from the caves.

===As a tourist attraction===

In 1903, Kents Cavern, then part of Lord Haldon&#x27;s estate, was sold to Francis Powe, a carpenter who originally used the caves as a workshop while making beach huts for the Torquay sea front. Powe&#x27;s son, Leslie Powe, turned the caves into a tourist attraction by laying concrete paths, installing electric lighting, and building visitor facilities that later were improved, in turn, by his son John Powe. The caves, now owned by Nick Powe, celebrated 100 years of Powe family ownership on 23 August 2003 with special events including an archæological dig for children and a display by a cave rescue team. A year later, a new £500,000 visitor centre was opened, including a restaurant and gift shop.

Attracting 80,000 tourists a year, Kents Cavern is an important tourist attraction, and this was recognised in 2000 when it was awarded Showcave of the Year award and later in November 2005 when it was awarded a prize for being Torquay&#x27;s Visitor Attraction of the year.

Kents Cavern is one of the most important geosites in the English Riviera Geopark, one of over 170 UNESCO Global Geoparks.

In 2023, Kents Cavern was put up for sale for up to £2,500,000 and bought by The Tudor Hotel Collection.

===Kents Cavern in fiction===
&quot;Hampsley Cavern&quot; in Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1924 novel &quot;The Man in the Brown Suit&quot; is based on Kents Cavern. The 2011 science fiction romance &quot;Time Watchers: The Greatest of These&quot;, by Julie Reilly, uses Kents Cavern as a principal setting in three different time periods.

<doc id="658985" wikidata="Q16209228" url="?curid=658985" title="Blue at the Mizzen">
<text>Blue at the Mizzen is the twentieth and last completed historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1999. It is set after the Napoleonic wars, in the fight for Chilean independence from Spain.

Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, having heard the details of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at Waterloo and having collected their share of the prize from their last capture, set sail for the dual mission of charting the Chilean coast and aiding those who seek independence from Spain. Maturin and his colleague Dr Amos Jacob speed the plot as covert intelligence agents and Aubrey&#x27;s political advisors, while Aubrey makes bold moves in dealing with the factions in Chile.

Reviewers were positive about this novel, finding it &quot;a shining jewel&quot;, &quot;an intricate, multifaceted work -- one of those rare novels that actually bear up under close scrutiny.&quot; The &quot;deeper sense of the culture of the age&quot; that marks the series is also true of this novel, which shows the &quot;period of deflation, both economic and emotional&quot; for the Royal Navy and its associated businesses after the victory. The new midshipman introduced in this novel, and Maturin&#x27;s new love, are well-liked. The young man is &quot;a dashing young foil for the ship&#x27;s elders&quot;, who shows that the main characters have aged and their pace has changed. The voyage to Chile treats readers once again &quot;to O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s talent for life on board, incidents and accidents&quot;. Aubrey has earned a &quot;just reward&quot; at the end, made an admiral of the blue. Feelings about the series as a whole are also positive, and strongly stated: &quot;&quot;There is nothing in this century that rivals Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s achievement in his chosen genre.&quot;; and readers can so easily enter this fictional world, because &quot;O&#x27;Brian did the hard learning long ago and then began to write with fully justified assurance and pleasure.&quot;

==Plot summary==

The &quot;Surprise&quot; sails out of Gibraltar but collides in the dark with a Nordic timber ship and returns for repairs. Back ashore, Aubrey hears a reliable description of the battle at Waterloo; he thanks Lord Keith for moving the prize court along briskly to share out their huge prize from capturing the gold meant to aid Napoleon before his fall, more than 382 pounds a share. Aubrey has clandestine visits with his cousin Isobel, Lord Barmouth&#x27;s wife. Admiral Lord Barmouth hastens the repair work, realizing he helps himself that way. Many Surprises desert. The frigate sails to Madeira for more serious repairs but arrives just in time to see Coelho&#x27;s famous shipyard at Funchal in flames. Maturin receives a coded report from Dr Amos Jacob regarding the Chilean situation and takes the &quot;Ringle&quot; to England, where Sir Joseph Blaine updates him. The Chileans have split into two factions: northern still interested in British help, and southern retaining the services of Sir David Lindsay to command the Chilean navy. Whilst Maturin stays with Sophie Aubrey at Woolcombe, Aubrey returns the &quot;Surprise&quot; to Seppings&#x27; yard in England for a thorough re-fit and recruits a strong, competent crew out of Shelmerston for the long voyage ahead. In London, the Duke of Clarence asks Aubrey to accept Horatio Hanson as a midshipman. Initially reluctant, Aubrey finds that the boy has the mathematical skills essential for a navigator and he becomes a competent sailor. Fully fitted, the &quot;Surprise&quot; stops at Funchal, picking up Jacob, and then heads for Freetown, where Maturin proposes marriage to a young attractive widow named Christine Wood. She shares his tastes for natural philosophy, but her view of marriage suffered from her first marriage, as her husband was impotent and she turns him down. She agrees on her upcoming trip to England to visit the Aubreys at their home in Dorset and to meet Maturin&#x27;s daughter Brigid there. &quot;Surprise&quot; then sails to the coast of Brazil, where Dr Amos Jacob parts to cross the mountains overland.

After a difficult rounding of Cape Horn, the expedition reaches San Patricio in Chile. &quot;Ringle&quot; goes for repairs following a grounding in the Pillón passage. After a meeting between Aubrey, Maturin and Sir David Lindsay, in which the two sides agree to mutually support each other, Maturin writes to Blaine describing the different juntas and the training of three republican sloops by the crew of the &quot;Surprise&quot;, who assist in capturing a moderate privateer. After meeting Dr Jacob with the intelligence he gathered, Aubrey heads to Valparaiso, while Maturin and Jacob ride there by mule. Here they meet General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, the Supreme Director, and Colonel Eduardo Valdes. Learning that the viceroy of Peru, under the Spanish king, plans to invade Chile, the group determine to confront the Royalist forces at Valdivia, where the viceroy will need to seek stores. The &quot;Surprise&quot; and &quot;Ringle&quot; make sail and Aubrey elaborates a plan to drop Chilean troops at Concepción while the ships destroy the gun-emplacements at Cala Alta and then bombard the fort at Valdivia.

The plan succeeds and the revolutionaries capture four chests of silver and one of gold, conveyed by the &quot;Surprise&quot; to Valparaiso and then overland to Santiago. Sir David fights a duel with one of his officers and dies. Popular local sentiment gradually turns against the British, and Aubrey receives news that the junta plans to impound his frigate. He decides to pre-empt action against &quot;Surprise&quot; by cutting out the Peruvian fifty-gun frigate &quot;Esmeralda&quot; at Callao in Peru to strengthen the Chilean navy. &quot;Surprise&quot; conducts a hard-fought broadside action and eventually the British-Chilean force takes the ship. Aubrey suffers wounds in the thigh and shoulder. Maturin and Jacob send a coded message of the successful cutting-out to Sir Joseph Blaine which the schooner takes to the &quot;Isaac Newton&quot;, as Dobson&#x27;s friends agree to carry the message across Panama to meet a returning merchantman. &quot;Ringle&quot; carries the news to Valparaiso.

The President of the Valparaiso junta, Don Miguel Carrera, gives Aubrey and his officers a lavish dinner, after which Aubrey insists on his sailors receiving their share of the prize-money and &quot;Esmeralda&quot;&#x27;s value by the end of the month. The next day Don Miguel authorizes five thousand pieces of eight and use of any naval stores the &quot;Surprise&quot; requires. With a fully repaired ship, Aubrey sets about training the young Chilean naval officers as the &quot;Surprise&quot; continues her survey of the Chilean coast for several weeks. Jacob arrives from Valparaiso on a private brig, with coded messages from Sir Joseph Blaine. First, the Duke of Clarence requests Horatio Hanson&#x27;s return to sit his lieutenant&#x27;s examination. Second, the Admiralty promotes Aubrey to Rear Admiral of the Blue, requiring him to take command of the South African squadron aboard at the River Plate, hoisting his flag, blue at the mizzen. Carrera arrives with a message saying it will take a further three months to complete the payments, releasing Aubrey from his responsibility to the Chileans. Aubrey sets course for the Strait of Magellan.

==Title==
A blue ensign at the mizzen-mast indicated the presence of a Rear Admiral of the Blue, the lowest flag-rank in the Royal Navy of the early 19th century.

==Allusions/references to actual history and current science==

===History===

The main plot loosely echoes Lord Cochrane&#x27;s setting up and commanding the Chilean Navy from 1818 to the early 1820s. A historical figure from Chile&#x27;s independence movement, Don Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, also features in the book. O&#x27;Higgins captured the Spanish frigate &quot;Esmeralda&quot; in 1820, a bit later than in this novel.

===Natural history===

Whilst in Sierra Leone, Christine Wood shows Stephen Maturin a prodigious amount of wildlife, including:
* an elephantine heron (&quot;Ardea goliath&quot;)
* a nightjar with elongated flight feathers (Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caprimulgus longipennis&quot;)
* a feather from the Congo peacock (&quot;Afropavo congensis&quot;)

Sailing in the Atlantic out of Shelmerston, a pod of seven right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, swam past the &quot;Surprise&quot;, one surfacing to clear the blow hole, evoking a former whaler&#x27;s cry, not a proper Royal Navy communication (thar she blows).

===Coca leaves===

In Peru, Maturin and Jacob also have a discussion about coca-leaves. Maturin keeps his leaves in his inner pocket in a pouch, along with the lime and necessary outer wrapping. Maturin expresses curiosity about their use in considerable quantities, and the resultant reaction according to altitude. He cites the porters in the Peruvian Andes, who increase their dose if they have to carry a heavy burden over a very high pass.

Jacob mentions that many sorts of coca exist. For example, the Tia Juana; and that asthmatic patients and those afflicted by migraines often experience hallucinations, their strength and frequency varying with the height.

==Allusions to real places==

Shelmerston, the home port of HMHV &quot;Surprise&quot; since she was bought out of the service by Maturin is fictional, but based on a real place on the western coast of England, Appledore near the River Torridge in Devon. Funchal is the long time capital of the island of Madeira, part of Portugal. Gibraltar is real, a British base in the Mediterranean Sea. Freetown was the government center for British West Africa, and is now the capital of Sierra Leone. The southern tip of South America, Cape Horn, is at best a hard voyage for a sailing ship. Valdivia, Concepción, Valparaíso, and Santiago and are real places in Chile. Callao is a port city in Peru, and was part of the Viceroyalty of Peru before it became independent from Spain. The Strait of Magellan is the passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean north of Tierra del Fuego discovered by Magellan. For sailing vessels going east to west, the Strait is more challenging, due to its narrowness and prevailing westerly winds, than rounding Cape Horn, which is further south. Going west to east, the Strait was faster if the season was right.

==Reviews==

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; likes the new character Horatio Hanson, marks the growing number of readers following this series, and hopes, as do most of the reviewers, (in vain) for another novel to follow this, as this novel is &quot;escape at its most intelligent and demanding.&quot; This novel sees Maturin fall in love again, and introduces a young midshipman for Aubrey to nurture, and described Aubrey aboard &quot;Surprise&quot; attacks the Spanish fleet as the climax of this novel.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; thinks readers may find this novel the best of the series, with Maturin&#x27;s love letters &quot;functioning as a chorus to the action.&quot; The naval actions along the Chilean coast earn Aubrey a &quot;just reward&quot;. They noted also the introduction of &quot;Horatio Hanson, bastard son of a nobleman, who comes on board as a midshipman, a dashing young foil for the ship&#x27;s elders.&quot; The comparison to Jane Austen&#x27;s writing is made again for this novel: &quot;O&#x27;Brian has rightfully been compared to Jane Austen, but one wonders if even she would have done justice to &quot;those extraordinary hollow dwellings, sometimes as beautiful as they were comfortless.&quot;&quot;
Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Amanda Foreman remarks that &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; is &quot;a shining jewel&quot; and &quot;an intricate, multifaceted work -- one of those rare novels that actually bear up under close scrutiny.&quot; Of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s popularity with the series, she says &quot;Here was a writer who deliberately challenged you to keep pace.&quot; As to the question of the ending of the series, &quot;&quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; could indeed be the finale. In a sense the heroes have clearly reached their destinations, and there is a psychological completeness to the novel even though the plot is inconclusive. Halfway through their adventures, while visiting Sierra Leone, Maturin experiences an emotional rebirth.&quot; For Aubrey, his long-sought goal is given by the book&#x27;s title, indicating he gets promoted to rear admiral of the Blue. Foreman feels that the author&#x27;s view is &quot;the end [is] less important than the journey itself.&quot; She closes with words of strong praise: &quot;There is nothing in this century that rivals Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s achievement in his chosen genre. His novels embrace with loving clarity the full richness of the 18th-century world. They embody the cruelty of battle, the comedy of men&#x27;s lives, the uncertain fears that plague their hearts; and yet, not far away, is the vision of an ideal existence.&quot;

John Casey, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that O&#x27;Brian covered the &quot;year after Waterloo, so it necessarily deals with a period of deflation, both economic and emotional, for the Royal Navy and its ancillary population of shipwrights, chandlers and seamen on the beach.&quot; and that he addressed &quot;this state of affairs succinctly and sharply in the first part of the story.&quot; Then the two main characters have their mission to aid Chile, and &quot;Of course Jack and Stephen must sail there, and readers are treated to O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s talent for life on board, incidents and accidents&quot;. The narrative is primarily from Aubrey and Maturin, but &quot;occasional glimpses from other perspectives that both give a capsule story -- in this case a sense of a calculated marriage -- and also provide contrast: Jack, for all his faults, is not &quot;capable of a shabby thing.&quot;&quot;

Casey assessed the overall appeal of the series, of Aubrey and Maturin, noting the &quot;political sophistication&quot;, &quot;a deeper sense of the culture of the age&quot; and the early introduction in the series of &quot;two strong women with quite different attitudes to life&quot;, Sophia Aubrey and her cousin Diana Villiers. The different specialty knowledge of each man, Aubrey with his full complement of nautical skills and Maturin the learned physician, naturalist and linguist, allows the author to have conversations where &quot;From time to time the two men fill each other in expertly, briskly and even wittily, and the reader is the third-party beneficiary.&quot; A more generally appealing feature of the novels, perhaps what draws women to the series as well as men, was &quot;the friendship between the two men&quot;, a plausible intimacy. Casey offered that readers can so easily enter this fictional world, because &quot;O&#x27;Brian did the hard learning long ago and then began to write with fully justified assurance and pleasure.&quot;

Harry Wessel in the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; appreciates Aubrey&#x27;s frustrations in peacetime, now that Napoleon is defeated. Yet there is more for Aubrey and Maturin to do. &quot;It turns out there is a lot they can do. The political intrigue in revolutionary Chile is right up Stephen&#x27;s alley, while Jack&#x27;s fighting skills also are called into play, culminating in a satisfying naval action that, as always, brims with historically accurate detail.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Jan Morris says the &quot;chronicle has aged too. It has lost something of its sprightly edge, its allusions are mistier and its pace is slower. This is in no way a criticism. As the Frenchman said: &#x27;Le style est l&#x27;homme même&#x27;, and just as Aubrey is no longer the exuberant young commander of the early novels, so O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s narrative has matured with him. So have we.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted that over three million copies of the books in the Aubrey-Maturin series have been sold, by November 1999.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote that &quot;O&#x27;Brian announced long ago that he hoped to write 20 volumes in his series centering on the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars and featuring Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin. Along the way, he has built up a huge British following, if a lesser one in the States, although American reviewers find the series splendidly literate. And so here is volume 20, which finds Napoleon defeated at Waterloo and Jack and now-widower Stephen at Gibraltar, sent on a mission to release Spain&#x27;s naval stranglehold on Chile and help Chile gain her independence.&quot; This is the last completed novel in the series.

<text>Jo Marie Payton (born August 3, 1950) is an American actress. She portrayed Harriette Baines Winslow on the ABC/CBS sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot; (1989–1998), a role she originated on its forerunner series &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. From 2001 to 2005, Payton provided the voice for Suga Mama Proud (Penny Proud&#x27;s paternal grandmother) on Disney Channel&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Proud Family&quot; and reprised the role in the 2005 television film &quot;The Proud Family Movie&quot; and also on Disney+&#x27;s revival &quot;The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder&quot;. The role earned her an NAACP Image Award nomination in 2005. Payton also had a recurring role as the personal assistant to Gregory Hines&#x27; character, Ben Doucette (Will Truman&#x27;s boss), during season two of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; (1999–2000).

==Early life and education==
Jo Marie Payton was born on August 3, 1950, in Albany, Georgia. Sometime during her early teens, her family relocated to Opa-locka, Florida. Payton attended high school at North Dade Jr./ Sr. High School and later graduated from Miami Carol City Senior High School in 1968. Continuing her education, Payton graduated from Albany State University. She then moved to California, where she joined the national touring company of the musical &quot;Purlie&quot;.

==Career==
Payton&#x27;s big break came when she was cast as Harriette Winslow, the elevator operator on the ABC sitcom &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, in 1987. Her performance was so well received by audiences that she was given her own sitcom, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, in 1989. Continuing her character Harriette Winslow from &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, she played a mother in a middle-class black family living in Chicago, Illinois. Payton left &quot;Family Matters&quot; partway through its final season, appearing for the last time on December 19, 1997, during increasing tension between her and star Jaleel White (the two nearly came to blows and had to be physically separated during Payton&#x27;s penultimate episode). Harriette Winslow was played by Judyann Elder in the show&#x27;s remaining eight episodes.

In 2002, Payton appeared on the &quot;TV Moms&quot; episode of the Anne Robinson version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, and was the third one voted off. In 2003, Payton and her daughter appeared on a Mother&#x27;s Day episode of &quot;Lingo&quot;, playing against fellow TV mom Meredith Baxter and her daughter. Baxter and her daughter won. In 2005, Jo Marie Payton provided the voice of Suga Mama in &quot;The Proud Family Movie&quot;. Her other television credits include &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, &quot;Reba&quot;, &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, &quot;Wanda at Large&quot;, &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, &quot;The Parkers&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;The Hughleys&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Moesha&quot;, &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot;, &quot;227&quot;, &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, &quot;Small Wonder&quot; and &quot;The New Odd Couple&quot;. She also appeared as Mama in the Canadian television miniseries &quot;The Rev&quot;.

In 2005, Payton co-hosted the 15th Annual NAACP Theatre Awards with Glynn Turman. In August 2009, she guest starred on &quot;Meet the Browns&quot; as Shirley Van Owen. Payton then hosted her own show, &quot;Second Chance with Jomarie Payton&quot;, on the Hometeam Network. In 2012, Payton appeared in the GMC TV movie special &quot;From This Day Forward&quot;.

===Other ventures===
In 2004, in an effort to help raise funds for Virginia Union University, Payton wrote letters to alumni urging them to donate money in amounts from $18.65 to $186,500, in honor of the university&#x27;s founding date of 1865. Payton also continued to donate, host charitable events, and support her alma mater of Albany State University while also continuing her education and making a successful career.

==Personal life==
Payton is a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. In 1999, she released a jazz album, &quot;Southern Shadows&quot;. Payton has been married four times and divorced three times. Her first marriage lasted from 1980 to 1987, and was to Marc France with whom she has a daughter, Chantale France, born in 1984. From April 17, 1993 until 1998, Payton was married to Rodney Noble. Shortly after divorcing Noble, Payton married Landrus Clark in 1998; they divorced in 2004. Payton has been married to Leonard Downs since 2007.

<doc id="658992" wikidata="Q2331208" url="?curid=658992" title="Gadget Boy &amp; Heather">
<text>Gadget Boy &amp; Heather is an animated television series co-produced between DIC Productions, L.P., France Animation, and M6. The series originally debuted in September 1995 in first-run syndication in the United States on Bohbot Entertainment&#x27;s Amazin&#x27; Adventures II block and in October 1995 on M6 in France on the channel&#x27;s M6 Kid block.

==Plot==
This series is about &quot;Gadget Boy&quot;, a bionic kid detective with a personality similar to that of Inspector Gadget. Just as clumsy as the original Inspector Gadget, Gadget Boy was usually bailed out of situations by the more practical Heather, though he was also helped greatly by his myriad high-tech gadgets and extendable arms and legs.

Gadget Boy&#x27;s bionic implants were installed by Switzerland-based inventor Myron Dabble (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) who has an unrequited crush on Heather. Gadget Boy and Heather receive their assignments from Italy-based Chief Stromboli (also voiced by LaMarche), who, much like Chief Quimby, is a frequent, long-suffering victim of Gadget Boy&#x27;s bungling. Gadget Boy is assisted by the beautiful and resourceful agent Heather (voiced by Tara Strong), a very tall equivalent of sorts to Penny (the difference being that Heather is in her early 20s). He is also assisted by a robotic dog named G-9 (also LaMarche), who serves as the &quot;Brain&quot; of this series, which shows through his morphing capabilities to get the gang out of the stickiest situations.

The main villain of this series, instead of Dr. Claw, is the mask-wearing six-armed villainess Spydra (voiced by Louise Vallance). Spydra is accompanied by Boris, a frequently abused, wisecracking, sarcastic vulture with a Russian accent, along with her twin henchmen Mulch and Houmous; they are all played by Maurice LaMarche.

The main title theme song was written and performed by Mike Piccirillo. Musical underscore composers were Mike Piccirillo and Jean-Michel Guirao.

==Characters==

===Heroes===
* Gadget Boy (voiced by Don Adams, later Maurice LaMarche in English; Luq Hamet and later Élie Semoun in French) is a bionic police detective working for Interpol in New York City. Equipped by his dog, G-9, and assisted by Heather, he was conceived as a bionic &quot;child&quot; with the personality of a &quot;perfect adult detective&quot; (although as with the aforementioned Inspector Gadget, he is anything but). Much like Inspector Gadget, Gadget Boy is equipped with gadgets in his body while he is clumsy as Gadget but will use the gadgets to get out of sticky situations. The bionic implants were installed by the inventor Myron Dabble. Agent Heather bails Gadget Boy out of danger, though he was also helped greatly by his myriad high-tech gadgets and extendable arms and legs. However, Gadget Boy is usually seen with Heather and G-9, unlike Gadget, who in the original series, will usually inform Penny and Brain once he receives his assignment that the mission is too dangerous and that he will be going on the mission alone, and usually be convinced that a disguised Brain is a M.A.D. agent. Gadget Boy and G-9 appear to switch between being fully robotic to being half robotic in different episodes. In &quot;Gadget Boy and the Uncommon Cold&quot;, it is revealed that Gadget Boy is half robot and thus catches a cold while G-9 does not. However, in &quot;Boy Power of Babble&quot;, Gadget Boy is unaffected by the &quot;babblizer ray&quot; because he is half robot with a mechanical brain, whereas G-9 is completely robotic. As the original voice of Inspector Gadget, Adams voices Gadget Boy in a similar manner. Gadget Boy commonly says &quot;Sowsers! Bowsers!&quot;, similar to Inspector Gadget&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Wowsers!&quot;
* Agent Heather (voiced by Tara Strong, credited as Tara Charendoff, in English and Catherine Privat in French) is an Interpol agent and aide to Gadget Boy. Heather has a slim build with short auburn hair and blue eyes and wears a green jacket, white shirt, blue jeans and dark teal ballet shoes. She is a more resourceful agent and is the equivalent of Penny from Inspector Gadget, except Heather is much taller than Penny and appears to be in her early 20s. Her name is Estelle in the French version, and it is revealed in &quot;Gadget Boy and the Wee Folk&quot; that her bloodline is Irish.
* G-9 (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is Gadget Boy&#x27;s robotic dog, similar to Brain. He can morph into anything and assists Gadget Boy to get him and his gang out of the stickiest situations. Gadget Boy and G-9 appear to switch between being fully robotic to being half robotic in different episodes. Although G-9 is a robot dog, in &quot;Boy Power of Babble&quot;, G-9 is revealed to be half robot when he is affected by the &quot;babblizer ray&quot;, enabling him the ability to speak in an old English, intelligent accent. Unlike Brain, G-9 is usually seen with Gadget Boy, and Gadget Boy does not mistake him for being an enemy agent, as opposed to when the original Inspector Gadget will usually, on the case, mistake Brain appearing incognito for being a M.A.D. agent.
* Chief Drake Stromboli (voiced LaMarche) is the chief of Interpol with an Italian accent. Stromboli has white hair and a white mustache and gives Gadget Boy and Heather their assignments. Like Chief Quimby, Stromboli is a frequent, long-suffering victim of Gadget Boy&#x27;s bungling. Assignments are printed on a long sheet of paper, often coming out of his tie, compared to the self-destructing paper on which Inspector Gadget will receive his messages, and don&#x27;t blow up in his face. 
* Myron Dabble (voiced by LaMarche) is a bespectacled inventor working for Interpol. He is the man who, like von Slickstein, equipped Gadget Boy with his gadgets. Myron has an unrequited crush on Heather. In &quot;Back to the Vulture&quot;, it is revealed that he was really born in Cleveland and speaks with a Swiss accent because he moved to Switzerland in his youth.

===Villains===
* Spydra (voiced by Louise Vallance in English and Monique Thierry in French) is the series&#x27; primary antagonist. Spydra wears a pink mask and has six arms, speaks in a loud voice, and is almost the female equivalent of Dr. Claw. Her primary goals are to bring down Gadget Boy and commit various grand crimes. Usually, Spydra is seen in her lair, much like Claw at his computer terminal, either in his castle or on the M.A.D.mobile, but does not run a large scale criminal organization similar to M.A.D. Also, Spydra&#x27;s whole body can be seen, unlike Claw in the original series, where only his arms are seen and he is hiding behind a chair, and Spydra can get out of her chair. Spydra sports six arms and hides her face under a mask, occasionally removing it to use one of her main powers: the ability to petrify anyone who sees her real face. However, the unmasking is always offscreen or is obscured. Her pet is a vulture named Boris, whom she is usually abusive towards, often using alliterations to insult Boris. Spydra&#x27;s minions are twin brothers Mulch and Hummus, the only recurring minions in the series, as opposed to the different recurring unnamed M.A.D. agents in Inspector Gadget (and sometimes a supervillain who will have a name and appear once, which is less apparent in the second season of the series). Her name is Arachna in the French version.
* Boris (voiced by LaMarche) is Spydra&#x27;s pet talking vulture. A long-suffering victim of Spydra&#x27;s verbal abuse, Boris speaks in a Russian accent. He differs from M.A.D. Cat in that M.A.D. Cat is a foil to Claw, in which he will either be petted or pounded on, whereas Boris is only abused in many ways by Spydra, such as being insulted, thrown, or, in extreme cases, petrified by Spydra. He tends to remind Spydra he has a desk job and likes food.
* Mulch and Hummus (both voiced by LaMarche) are twin brothers and Spydra&#x27;s criminal henchmen, often sent to do her dirty work. The design of Mulch and Hummus is somewhat like the recurring M.A.D. agents from the original Inspector Gadget series; however, Mulch and Hummus are the only henchmen to Spydra, as opposed to a large number of M.A.D. agents working for Dr. Claw. The running gag is she can&#x27;t tell them apart (Boris says Hummus is the one with the big nose).

==&quot;Gadget Boy&#x27;s Adventures in History&quot;==
The second season, produced in 1997 to fulfill E/I criteria, was titled &quot;Gadget Boy&#x27;s Adventures in History&quot;. Here, the young detective has to stop the evil Spydra across time. This, like &quot;Inspector Gadget&#x27;s Field Trip&quot;, aired on The History Channel. The series was later repeated on This is for Kids on This TV until September 23, 2011.

&quot;Adventures in History&quot; (along with &quot;Field Trip&quot;) would mark the final time Adams voiced the character in any form, as he retired in 1999. Inspector Gadget&#x27;s next appearance would be the series &quot;Gadget and the Gadgetinis&quot; (2002), where he was voiced by Maurice LaMarche.

<doc id="658994" wikidata="Q4231815" url="?curid=658994" title="Conflict (narrative)">
<text>Traditionally, conflict is a major element of narrative or dramatic structure that creates challenges in a story by adding uncertainty as to whether the goal will be achieved. In works of narrative, conflict is the challenge main characters need to solve to achieve their goals. However, narrative is not limited to a single conflict. In narrative, the term &quot;resolution&quot; refers to the closure or conclusion of the conflict, which may or may not occur by the story&#x27;s end.

==Basic nature==
Conflict in literature refers to the different drives of the characters or forces involved. Conflict may be internal or external—that is, it may occur within a character&#x27;s mind or between a character and exterior forces, (or point(s) of view). Conflict is most visible between two or more characters, usually a protagonist and an antagonist/enemy/villain, but can occur in many different forms. A character may as easily find themselves in conflict with a natural force, such as an animal or a weather event, like a hurricane. The literary purpose of conflict is to create tension in the story, making readers more interested by leaving them uncertain which of the characters or forces will prevail.

There may be multiple points of conflict in a single story, as characters may have more than one desire or may struggle against more than one opposing force. When a conflict is resolved and the reader discovers which force or character succeeds, it creates a sense of closure. Conflicts may resolve at any point in a story, particularly where more than one conflict exists, but stories do not always resolve every conflict. If a story ends without resolving the main or major conflict(s), it is said to have an &quot;open&quot; ending. Open endings, which can serve to ask the reader to consider the conflict more personally, may not satisfy them, but obvious conflict resolution may also leave readers disappointed in the story.

== Classification ==
The basic types of conflict in fiction have been commonly codified as &quot;man against man&quot;, &quot;man against nature&quot;, and &quot;man against self.&quot; Although frequently cited, these three types of conflict are not universally accepted. Ayn Rand, for instance, argued that &quot;man against nature&quot; is not a conflict because nature has no free will and thus can make no choices. Sometimes a fourth basic conflict is described, &quot;man against society&quot;. Some of the other types of conflict referenced include &quot;man against machine&quot; (&quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;), &quot;man against fate&quot; (&quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;), &quot;man against the supernatural&quot; (&quot;The Shining&quot;) and &quot;man against God&quot; (&quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;).

===Man against man===
&quot;Man against man&quot; conflict involves stories where characters are against each other. This is an external conflict. The conflict may be direct opposition, as in a gunfight or a robbery, or it may be a more subtle conflict between the desires of two or more characters, as in a romance or a family epic. This type of conflict is very common in traditional literature, fairy tales and myths. One example of the &quot;man against man&quot; conflict is the relationship struggles between the protagonist and the antagonist stepfather in &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot;. Other examples include Dorothy&#x27;s struggles with the Wicked Witch of the West in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; and Tom Sawyer&#x27;s confrontation with Injun Joe in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;.

===Man against nature===
&quot;Man against nature&quot; conflict is an external struggle positioning the character against an animal or a force of nature, such as a storm or tornado or snow. The &quot;man against nature&quot; conflict is central to Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, where the protagonist contends against a marlin. It is also common in adventure stories, including &quot;Robinson Crusoe.&quot; The TV show &quot;Man vs. Wild&quot; takes its name from this conflict, featuring Bear Grylls and his attempts to survive nature.

===Man against self===
With &quot;man against self&quot; conflict, the struggle is internal. A character must overcome their own nature or make a choice between two or more paths—good and evil; logic and emotion. A serious example of &quot;man against himself&quot; is offered by Hubert Selby Jr.&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, which centers around stories of addiction. In the novel &quot;Fight Club&quot; by Chuck Palahniuk, published in 1994, as well as in its 1999 film adaptation, the unnamed protagonist struggles against himself in what is revealed to be a case of dissociative identity disorder. &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; also focuses on internal conflict, as the titular character deals with her own neuroses and self-doubts.

===Man against society===
Sometimes a fourth basic conflict is described, &quot;man against society&quot;. Where man stands against a man-made institution (such as slavery or bullying), &quot;man against man&quot; conflict may shade into &quot;man against society&quot;. In such stories, characters are forced to make moral choices or frustrated by social rules in meeting their own goals. &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; are examples of &quot;man against society&quot; conflicts. So is &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, in which the pig Wilbur fights for his survival against a society that raises pigs for food.

== History ==
As with other literary terms, these have come about gradually as descriptions of common narrative structures. Conflict was first described in ancient Greek literature as the &quot;agon&quot;, or central contest in tragedy. According to Aristotle, in order to hold the interest, the hero must have a &quot;single&quot; conflict. The agon, or act of conflict, involves the protagonist (the &quot;first fighter&quot;) and the antagonist (a more recent term), corresponding to the hero and villain. The outcome of the contest cannot be known in advance, and according to later critics such as Plutarch, the hero&#x27;s struggle should be ennobling.

Even in modern non-dramatic literature, critics have observed that the agon is the central unit of the plot. The easier it is for the protagonist to triumph, the less value there is in the drama. In internal and external conflict alike, the antagonist must act upon the protagonist and must seem at first to overmatch them. For example, in William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Bear&quot;, nature might be the antagonist. Even though it is an abstraction, natural creatures and the scenery oppose and resist the protagonist. In the same story, the young boy&#x27;s doubts about himself provide an internal conflict, and they seem to overwhelm him.

Similarly, when godlike characters enter (e.g. Superman), correspondingly great villains have to be created, or natural weaknesses have to be invented, to allow the narrative to have drama. Alternatively, scenarios could be devised in which the character&#x27;s godlike powers are constrained by some sort of code, or their respective antagonist.

<doc id="659001" wikidata="Q1779874" url="?curid=659001" title="Combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia">
<text>Combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia is a regional anaesthetic technique, which combines the benefits of both spinal anaesthesia and epidural anaesthesia and analgesia. The spinal component gives a rapid onset of a predictable block. The indwelling epidural catheter gives the ability to provide long lasting analgesia and to titrate the dose given to the desired effect.

==Indications==
This technique also allows for better post operative pain relief. The epidural catheter may be left in place for up to 72 hours if required.

In labouring women, the onset of analgesia is more rapid with combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia compared with epidural analgesia. Combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia in labour was formerly thought to enable women to mobilise for longer compared with epidural analgesia, but this is not supported by a recent Cochrane review.

In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (September 2007) recommends combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia for women who require rapid onset of analgesia in labour. It further recommends the use of bupivacaine and fentanyl to establish the block.

==Insertion technique==
Combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia is a highly specialised technique which should only be administered by a properly trained anaesthetic practitioner working with full aseptic technique.

The &quot;needle-through-needle&quot; technique involves the introduction of a Tuohy needle (epidural needle) into the epidural space. The standard technique of loss of resistance to injection may be employed.

A long fine spinal needle (25G) is then introduced via the lumen of the epidural needle and through the dura mater, into the subarachnoid space. A small &quot;pop&quot; is felt as the dura is punctured, and the correct position is confirmed when cerebrospinal fluid can be seen dripping from the spinal needle.

A small dose of local anaesthetic (e.g. bupivacaine) is then instilled. An opioid such as fentanyl may also be given if desired. The spinal needle is then withdrawn and the epidural catheter inserted in the standard manner.

Alternatively, a &quot;two-level&quot; approach may be undertaken. The epidural space is first located in the standard manner. Then, at another level, a standard spinal is performed. Finally, the epidural catheter is threaded through the Tuohy needle.

==Maintenance technique==
When the epidural catheter has been inserted, the techniques of maintenance of block are very similar to those of epidural anaesthesia. The intensity of the block may be adjusted as desired. Large doses of local anaesthetic can produce sufficient anaesthesia for surgery. Alternatively, smaller doses can provide analgesia, e.g. in the postoperative period.

==Equipment==
A standard epidural pack may be used with a standard spinal needle. However, the standard length of a spinal needle (90mm) may be insufficiently long to reach the subarachnoid space through the Tuohy needle. An extra-long needle (e.g., 120 mm) may be required. Alternatively, several manufacturers produce packs containing both a spinal and an epidural needle which are slightly modified to fit together.

==Complications==
Combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia in labouring women is associated with more pruritus if fentanyl (25 μg) is given intrathecally, than low-dose epidural analgesia. However, no difference has been found in the incidence of post dural puncture headache, requirement for epidural blood patch or maternal hypotension.

It is unknown if infections are more likely to happen during combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia compared to spinal or epidural techniques. Post-dural-puncture headache has a similar incidence rate (0.8 to 2.5%) to the conventional epidural.

<doc id="659002" wikidata="Q192718" url="?curid=659002" title="Anthony James Leggett">
<text>Sir Anthony James Leggett (born 26 March 1938) is a British–American theoretical physicist and professor emeritus at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Leggett is widely recognised as a world leader in the theory of low-temperature physics, and his pioneering work on superfluidity was recognised by the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics. He has shaped the theoretical understanding of normal and superfluid helium liquids and strongly coupled superfluids. He set directions for research in the quantum physics of macroscopic dissipative systems and use of condensed systems to test the foundations of quantum mechanics.

==Early life and education==
Leggett was born in Camberwell, South London, and raised Catholic. His father&#x27;s forebears were village cobblers in a small village in Hampshire; Leggett&#x27;s grandfather broke with this tradition to become a greengrocer; his father would relate how he used to ride with him to buy vegetables at the Covent Garden market in London. His mother&#x27;s parents were of Irish descent; her father had moved to Britain and worked as a clerk in the naval dockyard in Chatham. His maternal grandmother, who survived into her eighties, was sent out to domestic service at the age of twelve. She eventually married his grandfather and raised a large family, then in her late sixties emigrated to Australia to join her daughter and son-in-law, and finally returned to the UK for her last years.

His father and mother were each the first in their families to receive a university education; they met and became engaged while students at the Institute of Education at the University of London, but were unable to get married for some years because his father had to care for his own mother and siblings. His father worked as a secondary school teacher of physics, chemistry and mathematics. His mother also taught secondary school mathematics for a time, but had to give this up when he was born. He was eventually followed by two sisters, Clare and Judith, and two brothers, Terence and Paul, all raised in their parents&#x27; Roman Catholic faith. Leggett ceased to be a practising Catholic in his early twenties.

Soon after he was born, his parents bought a house in Upper Norwood, south London. When he was 18 months old, WWII broke out and he was evacuated to Englefield Green, a small village in Surrey on the edge of the great park of Windsor Castle, where he stayed for the duration of the war. After the end of the war, he returned to the Upper Norwood house and lived there until 1950; his father taught at a school in north-east London and his mother looked after the five children full-time. He attended the local Catholic primary school, and later, following a successful performance in the 11-plus, which he took rather earlier than most, and then transferred to Wimbledon College. 

He later attended Beaumont College, a Jesuit school in Old Windsor. He and his two younger brothers, Terrence and Paul, attended Beaumont as a consequence of his father&#x27;s appointment to teach science at the college. While there, Leggett primarily studied classics, since that was generally regarded as the most prestigious field at the time; this study led directly to his Greats degree while at Oxford. Despite Leggett&#x27;s emphasis on classics at Beaumont, his father ran an evening &#x27;science club&#x27; for his younger son and a couple of others. In his last year at Beaumont, Leggett won every single prize for the subjects that he studied that year.

Leggett won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, in December 1954 and entered the University the following year with the intention of reading the degree technically known as Literae Humaniores (classics). After completing his first degree he began a second undergraduate degree, this time in physics at Merton College, Oxford. One person who was willing to overlook Leggett&#x27;s unorthodox credentials was Dirk ter Haar, then a reader in theoretical physics and a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford; so Leggett signed up for research under ter Haar&#x27;s supervision. As with all of ter Haar&#x27;s students in that period, the tentatively assigned thesis topic was &quot;Some Problems in the Theory of Many-Body Systems&quot;, which left a considerable degree of latitude.

Dirk took a great interest in the personal welfare of his students and their families, and was meticulous in making sure they received adequate support; indeed, he encouraged Leggett to apply for a Prize Fellowship at Magdalen, which he held from 1963 to 1967. In the end Leggett&#x27;s thesis consisted of studies of two somewhat disconnected problems in the general area of liquid helium, one on higher-order phonon interaction processes in superfluid 4He and the other on the properties of dilute solutions of 4He in normal liquid 3He (a system which unfortunately turned out to be much less experimentally accessible than the other side of the phase diagram, dilute solutions of 3He in 4He). The University of Oxford awarded Leggett an Honorary DLitt in June 2005.

==Career ==
Leggett spent the period August 1964 – August 1965 as a postdoctoral research fellow at UIUC, and David Pines and his colleagues (John Bardeen, Gordon Baym, Leo Kadanoff and others) provided a fertile environment.
He then spent a year in the group of Professor Takeo Matsubara at Kyoto University in Japan.

After one more postdoctoral year which he spent in &quot;roving&quot; mode, spending time at Oxford, Harvard, and Illinois, in the autumn of 1967 he took up a lectureship at the University of Sussex, where he was to spend the majority of the next fifteen years of his career. During the mid 1970s, he spent considerable time in Japan at the University of Tokyo and also at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana.

In early 1982 he accepted an offer from UIUC of the MacArthur Chair with which the university had recently been endowed. As he had already committed himself to an eight-month stay as a visiting scientist at Cornell in early 1983, he finally arrived in Urbana in the early fall of that year, and has been there ever since.

Leggett&#x27;s own research interests shifted away from superfluid 3He since around 1980; he worked inter alia on the low-temperature properties of glasses, high-temperature superconductivity, the Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) atomic gases and above all on the theory of experiments to test whether the formation of quantum mechanics will continue to describe the physical world as we push it up from the atomic level towards that of everyday life.

From 2006 to 2016, he also held a position at the Institute for Quantum Computing in Waterloo, Canada.

As of April 2023, he is chief scientist at the Institute for Condensed Matter Theory, a research institute at the UIUC.

In 2013, he became the founding director of the Shanghai Center for Complex Physics.

==Research ==
His research focuses on cuprate superconductivity, superfluidity in highly degenerate atomic gases, low temperature properties of amorphous solids, conceptual issues in the formulation of quantum mechanics and topological quantum computation.

The edition of 29 December 2005 of the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; printed an article, &quot;New tests of Einstein&#x27;s &#x27;spooky&#x27; reality&quot;, which referred to Leggett&#x27;s Autumn 2005 debate at a conference in Berkeley, California, with fellow Nobel laureate Norman Ramsey of Harvard University. Both debated the worth of attempts to change quantum theory. Leggett thought attempts were justified, Ramsey opposed. Leggett believes quantum mechanics may be incomplete because of the quantum measurement problem.

==Awards and honours==
Leggett is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Russian Academy of Sciences (foreign member), the Indian National Science Academy, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1980, a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1985, and American Institute of Physics, and an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Physics (HonFInstP) in 1998.

He was awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics (with V. L. Ginzburg and A. A. Abrikosov) for pioneering contributions to the theory of superconductors and superfluids. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Physics (UK). He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 2004 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours &quot;for services to physics&quot;. He also won the 2002/2003 Wolf Foundation Prize for research on condensed forms of matter (with B. I. Halperin). He was also honoured with the Eugene Feenberg Memorial Medal (1999). He has been elected as a Foreign Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (2011).

==Personal life==
In June 1973, he married Haruko Kinase. They met at Sussex University, in Brighton, England. In 1978, they had a daughter Asako. His wife Haruko earned a PhD in cultural anthropology from UIUC and has done research on the hospice system. Their daughter, Asako, also graduated from UIUC with a joint major in geography and chemistry. She holds dual US/UK citizenship.

<text>Antennaria is a genus of dioecious perennial herbs in the family Asteraceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a few species (&quot;A. chilensis&quot;, &quot;A. linearifolia&quot;, &quot;A. sleumeri&quot;) in temperate southern South America; the highest species diversity is in North America. Common names include catsfoot or cat&#x27;s-foot, pussytoes and everlasting.

Different &quot;Antennaria&quot; species reach between 10 cm and 50 cm in height. The leaves are basal and often stem leaves. The name &quot;Antennaria&quot; refers to the projecting stamens seen on the male flowers of some species, resembling insect antennae. 

&quot;Antennaria&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Vanessa virginiensis&quot; (American painted lady), &quot;Coleophora pappiferella&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;A. dioica&quot;), &quot;Schinia verna&quot; (which feeds on several &quot;Antennaria&quot; species).

<doc id="659016" wikidata="Q3336879" url="?curid=659016" title="National Football League Players Association">
<text>The National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) is the labor union representing National Football League (NFL) players. The NFLPA, which has headquarters in Washington, D.C., is led by executive director Lloyd Howell Jr. and president Jalen Reeves-Maybin. Founded in 1956, the NFLPA is the second-oldest labor union of the major North American professional sports leagues; it was established to provide players with formal representation to negotiate compensation and the terms of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The NFLPA is a member of the AFL–CIO, the largest federation of unions in the United States.

In the early years of the NFL, contractual negotiations took place between individual players, their agents, and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union&#x27;s existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2020.

In addition to conducting labor negotiations, the NFLPA represents and protects the rights of the players; the organization&#x27;s actions include filing grievances against player discipline that it deems too severe. The union also ensures that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement are adhered to by the league and the teams. It negotiates and monitors retirement and insurance benefits and enhances and defends the image of players and their profession.

==Background==

The establishment of the National Football League in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often saddled with financial difficulties, poor player talent and attendance rates. As the league expanded through the years, players were provided with no formal representation and received few, if any, benefits. In 1943, Roy Zimmerman&#x27;s refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the Washington Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles. With the formation of the competing All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946, NFL owners instituted a rule which banned a player for five years from NFL-associated employment if he left the league to join the AAFC.

Bill Radovich, an offensive lineman, was one player who &quot;jumped&quot; leagues; he played for the Detroit Lions in 1945 and then joined the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC after the team offered him a greater salary. Subsequently, Radovich was blacklisted by the NFL and was denied a tryout with the NFL-affiliated San Francisco Seals baseball team of the Pacific Coast League. Unable to attain a job in either league, Radovich filed a lawsuit against the NFL in 1956. The case, &quot;Radovich v. National Football League&quot;, , made its way to the United States Supreme Court in January 1957, with the court ruling that the NFL constituted a business under American antitrust law and did not enjoy the same immunity accorded to Major League Baseball. This ruling &quot;set the foundation for a series of court battles&quot; over compensation and employment conditions.

==Initial organizing phase (1956–1967)==

The NFLPA began when two players from the Cleveland Browns, Abe Gibron and Dante Lavelli, approached a lawyer and former Notre Dame football player, Creighton Miller, to help form an association to advocate for the players. Miller was initially reluctant but accepted in 1956. He contacted Don Shula (a Baltimore Colts player at the time), Joe Schmidt of the Detroit Lions, Frank Gifford and Sam Huff of the New York Giants, and Norm Van Brocklin of the Los Angeles Rams to aid in the development of the association.

By November 1956 a majority of the players signed cards allowing the NFLPA to represent them. Players for 11 of the 12 teams in the league voted to join the new association, with the Chicago Bears being the sole holdout.

An initial meeting was convened at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in November 1956 where players decided on demands to be submitted to league commissioner Bert Bell. One particularly sore point involved the lack of compensation for training camp and preseason exhibition games; while owners charged admission and benefitted from a lucrative series of preseason games, no contract payment was made until a player made a regular season roster. Players would work for up to eight weeks, risking season- or career-ending injury without pay.

The new association&#x27;s initial agenda also included a league-wide minimum salary, plus a &quot;per diem&quot; when teams were on the road, a requirement that uniforms and equipment be paid for and maintained at the clubs&#x27; expense, and continued payment of salaries when players were injured. The NFLPA hoped to meet with Bell during the owners&#x27; meeting in January 1957 to discuss the demands; however, no meeting took place.

The owners, for their part, were immediately antagonistic to the concept of a players&#x27; union — a position epitomized when Miller, then an assistant coach with the Cleveland Browns, was removed from the team&#x27;s annual photo at the insistence of head coach and general manager Paul Brown. Miller and other union founders were taken aback by Paul Brown&#x27;s staunch view that &quot;it was both just and necessary that management could cut, trade, bench, blackball, and own in perpetuity anyone and everyone that it wanted&quot;.

Miller continued to represent the NFLPA in their early days. Unable to win the owners&#x27; attention by forming the union, the NFLPA threatened to bring an antitrust lawsuit against the league. The antitrust laws are meant to protect &quot;free and fair competition in the marketplace&quot; and prohibit practices that may give industries or businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors.

Rather than face another lawsuit, the owners agreed to a league minimum salary of $5,000, $50 for each exhibition game played, and medical and hospital coverage. Although most of the NFLPA&#x27;s requests were met, the owners did not enter into a collective bargaining agreement with the association or formally recognize it as the players&#x27; exclusive bargaining representative, instead agreeing to change the standard player contract and alter governing documents to reflect the deal.

From the inception of the NFLPA, its members were divided over whether it should act as a professional association or a union. Against the wishes of NFLPA presidents Pete Retzlaff and Bernie Parrish, Miller ran the association as a &quot;&#x27;grievance committee&#x27;&quot; rather than engaging in collective bargaining. The standard collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is a contract between organized workers and management that determines the wages and hours worked by employees and can also determine the scope of one&#x27;s work and what benefits employees receive. The association continued to use the threat of antitrust litigation over the next few years as a lever to gain better benefits, including a pension plan and health insurance.

In the 1960s the NFL also faced competition from the new American Football League (AFL). NFL players viewed the new league as potential leverage for them to improve their contracts. The NFL tried to discourage this idea by changing the owner-controlled pension plan to add a provision saying that a player would lose his pension if he went to another league.

On January 14, 1964, players in the newer league formed the AFL Players Association, and elected linebacker Tom Addison of the Boston Patriots as president. Rather than working with the AFLPA, the NFLPA chose to remain apart and tried to block the merger between the two leagues in 1966, though lack of funding prevented it from mounting a formal challenge. With the merger complete, the players could no longer use the leverage of being able to sign with an AFL team to attain more money.

Parrish, upset with the ineffectiveness of the association, proposed forming a players&#x27; union, that would be independent of the NFLPA, with the assistance of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The IBT pushed for the NFLPA to join the trucking union. In early November 1967, Parrish, with support from former Cleveland Browns player Jim Brown, began distributing union cards to form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation of Pro Athletes. The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in Hollywood, Florida, during the first week of January 1968 and declared itself an independent union. Although Parrish&#x27;s proposal was defeated, Miller left his position as counsel to the union. He was later replaced by two Chicago labor lawyers, Dan Schulman and Bernie Baum.

==Recognition and certification (1968–1983)==
Six months after the NFLPA declared itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied with the lack of compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968, after official discussions with the owners stalled. The owners countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.

As the merger of the AFL and NFL became effective in 1970, the unions agreed to meet for the first time in January of that year. The NFL players wanted Ed Meador—who was the president-elect of the NFLPA prior to the merger—to become president of the newly combined association while the AFL players wanted Jack Kemp. The compromise was John Mackey of the Baltimore Colts, an NFL team before the merger, which was grouped with former AFL teams in the American Football Conference. The AFL players agreed to Mackey&#x27;s election on the condition that former AFL player Alan Miller would become general counsel. Though the NFL owners were open to recognizing the union, their representatives requested lawyers not be present during negotiations, something the players were unwilling to agree to. This prompted the players to petition the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for union certification.

===1970 strike===
The NFLPA voted to strike on July 3, 1970, after having filed an unfair labor practices charge with the NLRB the previous month. The strike ended on August 3, just in time to avoid cancellation of preseason games. A new four-year CBA was reached after the owners threatened to cancel the season. With the new agreement, the union won the right for players to bargain through their own agents with the clubs, and minimum salaries were increased to $12,500 for rookies and $13,000 for veterans. Also, players&#x27; pensions were improved and dental care was added to the players&#x27; insurance plans. Players also gained the right to select representation on the league&#x27;s retirement board and the right to impartial arbitration for injury grievances. Following the 1970 agreement, many union representatives were released by their teams. Unfazed, the players were determined to create a stronger union through better communication. Attorney Ed Garvey was hired by the NFLPA in 1971 to act as their first executive director, and the NFLPA became officially certified as a union by the NLRB the same year. Headquarters were established in Washington, D.C., and a campaign was launched to help inform players of their rights.

===1974 strike===
The NFLPA challenged the so-called &quot;Rozelle Rule&quot; as a violation of federal antitrust laws in a lawsuit filed by president John Mackey and allied union leaders in 1971. The rule, named after commissioner Pete Rozelle, allowed the commissioner to award compensation, which included players, to a team losing a free agent if both the signing team and the team the player was departing could not come to an agreement on compensation. This rule limited player movement, as few teams were willing to sign high-profile free agents only to risk having their rosters raided. With the 1970 CBA agreement set to expire, the players went on strike on July 1, 1974. In addition to the &quot;Rozelle Rule&quot;, the players demanded the elimination of the option clause, impartial arbitration of disputes, elimination of the draft and waiver system and individual, rather than uniform contracts. The strike did not stop the 1974 preseason from going forward; the NFL used all-rookie squads as replacement players to play out the preseason schedule until the strike was resolved.

The strike lasted until August 10, 1974, when the players returned to training camp without a new CBA, instead choosing to pursue free agency through the &quot;Mackey&quot; lawsuit filed three years before. While the courts ruled in favor of the players in 1976, the union found that making progress in bargaining was more difficult to achieve. The Rozelle Rule was invalidated by the court which found it constituted a refusal to deal and was therefore in violation of the Sherman Act as it deterred franchises from signing free agents. However, the change did not achieve true free agency as compensation remained tied to draft picks that were awarded based on the salary of the departing free agent and teams still maintained a right of first refusal. The NFL and NFLPA agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in March 1977 that ran until 1982.

===1982 strike===
The 1982 NFL strike began on Tuesday, September 21, and lasted 57 days, ending on November 16. During this time, no NFL games were played. The strike occurred because the union demanded that a wage scale based on percentage of gross revenues be implemented. The NFLPA wanted the percentage to be 55 percent, and according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, this demand &quot;dominated the negotiations.&quot;

During the strike, the NFLPA promoted two &quot;AFC–NFC &#x27;all-star&#x27; games.&quot; One was held at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., on October 17, and the second was held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum a day later. One of the few stars who did play, future Hall of Fame running back John Riggins, explained &quot;I guess I&#x27;ll do just about anything for money.&quot; Despite a local TV blackout of WTBS and ticket prices starting at six dollars, neither game drew well; only 8,760 fans attended in Washington and 5,331 in Los Angeles. With no NFL games to air, CBS replayed the previous Super Bowl and aired Division III football; Pat Summerall and John Madden, for example, covered a game between Baldwin Wallace and Wittenberg. NBC acquired the rights to Canadian Football League games from ESPN, and both networks aired their respective games with NFL-like production values. However, the three CFL games NBC showed were all blowouts (by a total of 96 points) with poor ratings, and the network gave up.

The 1982 strike ended with a players&#x27; revolt against their own union, as some members suggested that Garvey step down as executive director. As a result of the strike, the season schedule was reduced from 16 games to 9 and the playoffs expanded the then-standard 10 to 16 teams (eight from each conference) for this one-season only &quot;Super Bowl tournament.&quot; A new five-year agreement was ratified, providing severance packages to players upon retirement, an increase in salaries and post-season pay, and bonuses based on the number of years of experience in the league. Additionally, the NFLPA was allowed to receive copies of all player contracts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Note/Condon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene Upshaw era (1983–2008)==
In 1983, former Oakland Raider Gene Upshaw became the executive director of the NFLPA. During his tenure, he oversaw a player strike, several antitrust lawsuits, and the collective bargaining agreement of 1993.

===1987 strike===

The NFLPA went on strike for a month in 1987 upon the expiration of the 1982 CBA; the league&#x27;s free-agent policy was the major matter in dispute. This time, however, the strike only canceled one week of the season. For three weeks, the NFL staged games with hastily assembled replacement teams, made up principally of players cut during training camp and players left out of work from the closure of the United States Football League two years prior (along with, to a lesser extent, the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL), who had folded just three months prior to the strike). They were joined by a few veterans who crossed the picket lines, including New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Randy White, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, New England Patriots quarterback Doug Flutie, and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent.

Given the willingness of the players to cross the picket lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place. The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge David Doty to overturn the league&#x27;s restricting free agent policies.

On November 1, 1989, the Court of Appeals rejected the suit on the grounds that the owners were covered by the labor exemption from antitrust law. The union&#x27;s next tactic, in November 1989, was to disclaim any interest in representing NFL players in collective bargaining and to reform itself as a professional organization. Having done that, individual players, led by Freeman McNeil of the New York Jets, brought a new antitrust action, challenging the NFL&#x27;s so-called &quot;Plan B&quot; free agency, which gave teams a right of first refusal to sign a player, as an unlawful practice under the antitrust acts.

The players ultimately prevailed after a jury trial on their claims. That verdict, the pendency of other antitrust cases and the threat of a class action lawsuit filed by Reggie White, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, on behalf of all NFL players caused the parties to settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency. In return, the owners received a salary cap, albeit one tied to a formula based on the players&#x27; share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floor—minimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 30–2 to accept the NFLPA&#x27;s final proposal.

=== Financial Registration Program ===
The NFLPA&#x27;s Financial Registration Program was created in 2002 after a series of many investment schemes targeted at professional athletes. It aims to provide an extra layer of protection to athletes to protect them from fraud and poor advice, and provide players with advisors and agents who are pre-screened by the NFL.

==DeMaurice Smith era (2009–2023)==

Following the death of Gene Upshaw in 2008, Richard Berthelsen was named interim executive director, serving from August 2008 until March 2009. The NFLPA Board of Representatives elected DeMaurice Smith for a three-year term as the executive director on March 16, 2009. Smith&#x27;s contract was renewed for an additional three years in March 2012. He was elected for a third term in March 2015. The major issue of Smith&#x27;s tenure has been the 2011 lockout; former offensive lineman Chester Pitts praised Smith for fiercely fighting for the players&#x27; rights during negotiations.

===2011 lockout===
In May 2008, the owners decided to opt out of the 1993 arrangement, per the agreement with the players, with the termination to follow a year with no salary cap in 2010. By the CBA&#x27;s expiration in March 2011, the NFLPA and the NFL had not yet come to terms on a new agreement. The owners were expected to lock out the players upon termination of the agreement. However, the NFLPA filed papers to decertify as a union on March 11, 2011, and filed an antitrust suit to enjoin the lockout with lead plaintiffs quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees. U.S. District Court judge Susan Richard Nelson granted the players&#x27; request to end the owners&#x27; lockout on April 25. The league asked Nelson to stay the order while they appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals; Nelson refused. On April 29, the Eighth Circuit granted the league a temporary stay of Nelson&#x27;s ruling; the league reinstated the lockout the same day. The Eighth Circuit vacated Nelson&#x27;s ruling on July 8, affirming the legitimacy of the lockout. During the lockout, players were barred from using team facilities and contacting team coaches; many organized their own workout regimens.

The parties settled the lawsuit on July 25, 2011, and a majority of players signed union authorization cards. The NFL officially recognized the NFLPA&#x27;s status as the players&#x27; collective bargaining representative on July 30, 2011. The NFL and NFLPA proceeded to negotiate terms for a new collective bargaining agreement, and the agreement became effective after ratification by the players August 4, 2011. The agreement, which ran through 2021, stated that revenue sharing (the most contentious issue during the lockout) was re-designed so that the players must receive at least 47% of all revenue in salary for the term of the agreement. Additionally, a limit was placed on the amount of money given to rookies. $50,000,000 was set aside annually for medical research and approximately $1 billion would be set aside for retired player benefits over the life of the agreement.

===Bountygate===
The NFLPA, on behalf of Will Smith, Scott Fujita and Anthony Hargrove, three players suspended due to the Bountygate investigation by the NFL, filed a lawsuit against the league. The investigation found that New Orleans Saints players were allegedly paid bonuses for hits that injured opposing players. The players&#x27; lawsuit claimed NFL commissioner Roger Goodell &quot;had violated the league&#x27;s labor agreement by showing he had pre-determined the guilt of the players punished in the bounty probe before serving as the arbitrator for their June 18 appeal hearing&quot;. The suspensions were unanimously overturned by a three-member appeals panel; however, the ruling did not permanently void their suspensions. The NFL appointed former commissioner Paul Tagliabue to review the NFL&#x27;s sanctions against the players, which he overturned.

===New drug policy===
The league and the NFLPA approved updated substance abuse and performance-enhancing substance policies in September 2014. The regulations include human growth hormone testing and amended rules on DUIs and marijuana. Third-party arbitration will handle appeals. The deal lifted suspensions for some players the week it was approved. The NFL began testing players for HGH the next month.

== Lloyd Howell Jr. era (2023–present) ==
Lloyd Howell Jr. was named the new executive director of the association on June 23, 2023.

==Composition==
According to NFLPA&#x27;s Department of Labor records since 2006, much of the union&#x27;s membership are classified as &quot;former players&quot; and are not eligible to vote in the union, &quot;because, as a matter of federal law, they cannot be members of the collective bargaining unit.&quot; The other, voting eligible, classifications are &quot;active players&quot; and &quot;associate members&quot;. , these include 13,213 &quot;former player members&quot;, 2,125 &quot;active players&quot;, and 438 &quot;associate members&quot;. For comparison, in 2014 these figures were 3,130, 1,959, and 207 (respectively).

==Leadership==
The current president of the NFLPA is Jalen Reeves-Maybin and the executive director is Lloyd Howell Jr. As of 2024, the executive committee consists of Oren Burks, Calais Campbell, Austin Ekeler, Thomas Hennessy, Cameron Heyward, Case Keenum, Ryan Kelly, Brandon McManus, and Thomas Morstead. Each NFL team also has a player representative, along with two to three alternate representatives.

<text>The Hundred Days is the nineteenth historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by British author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1998. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars, specifically in their last portion in 1815, the Hundred Days.

Napoleon escaped his exile at Elba and gained a huge army as he marched up from the south coast of France to Paris, unseating Louis XVIII. The allies of 1813 and 1814 are coming together again to join their armies on land to stop Napoleon keeping the France he has retaken. Forces on the north coast of Africa are raising money to block the allied armies from joining, favoring Napoleon. Aubrey and his convoy are given the mission to destroy shipyards supporting Napoleon along the Adriatic Coast and to stop that money, if it indeed has been raised, from reaching its destination. Maturin and Dr Amos Jacob negotiate in Algiers, where, among other accomplishments, Maturin shoots a lioness leaping at him and the Dey of Algiers.

Reviewers enjoyed this novel, especially that it has all they expect of a novel in this series, plus more of a plot, and one goes so far as to say &quot;This is strictly an adventure tale.&quot; Many authors write fictional tales set in the dramatic Hundred Days after Napoleon escaped his exile and induced a conclusive end to the long wars, but &quot;O&#x27;Brian has added a clever fictional twist&quot; with the plot bringing the reader to North Africa on a hunt for a galley full of small gold ingots to release a large army of mercenaries to increase the odds of Napoleon&#x27;s large and rapidly re-built army winning. There is another aspect to the novel, as it starts with deaths, leaving Maturin a widower, so that &quot;its recurring leitmotif is one of the subtlest sketchings of deep, deep grief in literature.&quot; What makes this novel special is the &quot;rendering of the internal lives of the characters – his loving and apt portrayal of their rich mix of feelings and experiences&quot;. Others note that over the long years of writing this series, the powers of the author have not diminished, yet the characters are &quot;realistically aging&quot; and &quot;their victory is not without cost.&quot; The novel&#x27;s &quot;prose moves between the maritime sublime and the Austenish bon mot, &quot;a man generally disliked is hardly apt to lavish good food and wine on those who despise him, and Ward&#x27;s dinners were execrable&quot;.&quot; Again, the author&#x27;s staying power as a writer is commended: &quot;O&#x27;Brian continues to unroll a splendid Turkish rug of a saga&quot; A key to the success of the novel is O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;invention of dual heroes, the bluff and ultracompetent Aubrey being always accompanied by his eccentric ship&#x27;s surgeon, Stephen Maturin&quot;, and although the Napoleonic Wars have come to a close, this time for good, the ending of the novel suggests it is not the last adventure for Aubrey and Maturin.

==Plot summary==

Maturin rejoins the squadron at Funchal after burying his wife, killed when her carriage overturned. Fitted out, Commodore Aubrey&#x27;s squadron meets at Gibraltar with Admiral Lord Keith, who updates him on Napoleon&#x27;s success at Paris and the armies gathered on land. He orders Aubrey first to defend a convoy of merchant ships from Moorish xebecs and galleys, and then to proceed to the Adriatic Sea to destroy any new ships being built to support Napoleon. The grieving Maturin, in a separate meeting, learns of a plot to send sufficient gold through Algiers to fund Muslim mercenaries who would block the Russian forces from joining those of the other allies, so Napoleon&#x27;s army can attack one army at a time. Aubrey&#x27;s squadron is successful in defending the convoy. The captain of the &quot;Pomone&quot; is haunted by the faces of the galley slaves who died when his ship attacked theirs; Aubrey reports he died cleaning his guns, and a new captain is assigned to &quot;Pomone&quot;. The convoy proceeds toward the Adriatic, stopping in Mahón. Asea, they encounter Captain Christy-Palliere, of the Royalist &quot;Caroline&quot; and an old acquaintance, who informs Aubrey about the French situation in the Adriatic before parting. Amos Jacob is sent out on &quot;Ringle&quot; to Kutali and Spalato to gain more information. &quot;Surprise&quot; sinks a French frigate under the command of an Imperialist at Ragusa Vecchia. Jacob rejoins near Porte di Spalato where they meet another French frigate, whose captain, like so many, does not want to declare for Napoleon but fears he will win. Maturin and Jacob negotiate an agreement for the French frigate to fight a mock battle against both &quot;Surprise&quot; and &quot;Pomone&quot;; the Frenchman then accompanies &quot;Pomone&quot; to Malta. Following up the pressure put on banks not to loan to the small shipyards, they lay out gold to push disgruntled dockworkers to burn new French ships along the coast, which is effective.

Reaching Algiers, Maturin and Jacob meet the Consul, Sir Peter Clifford, and his wife. They meet with the Dey&#x27;s Vizier at Kasbah, the Dey&#x27;s palace. They travel to meet the Dey, Omar Pasha, at his hunting-lodge at Shatt el Khadna in the Atlas Mountains. The Dey invites Maturin to hunt lions with him. The Dey kills a large lion while Maturin kills its lioness as it leaps to them, saving the Dey&#x27;s life. For this deed, Omar Pasha swears that no gold will sail from Algiers, and gives Maturin one of his rifles as a parting gift. Jacob befriends Ahmed Ben Habdal, who reveals that Pasha sent a contrary message to the Sheikh of Azgar, to have the gold carried by a fast-sailing xebec from Arzila, near Tangiers, captained by an Algerian corsair via the Strait of Gibraltar straight to Durazzo. Maturin and Jacob return to Algiers, and wait for &quot;Ringle&quot; to appear. Maturin buys two Irish children in the slave market. Once he sees the &quot;Ringle&quot; windbound off shore, they engage a local vessel to put them aboard &quot;Ringle&quot;. Before leaving, they learn Pasha is killed, and replaced by Ali Bey.

Reade relates the damage sustained by &quot;Surprise&quot; during the fierce storm. They join Aubrey in Port Mahon, and speak with Admiral Fanshawe. Aubrey agrees to pursue the xebec. They encounter &quot;Hamadryad&quot; under old friend Heneage Dundas, who tells them that Lord Barmouth is in place of Lord Keith. In Gibraltar, Maturin tells Aubrey not to worry about Barmouth, because Peter Arden, Barmouth&#x27;s political man, respects Lord Keith. Barmouth tells Aubrey to take his broad pennant down, as his squadron is dispersed. Later, Barmouth is joined by his new wife, who he learns is a cousin to Aubrey. On his return, Aubrey finds Barmouth friendly to him, as Barmouth wanted his wife with him. Before leaving for this battle, Maturin leaves the twin children with Lady Keith.

Dr Jacob learns the corsair has two galleys to act as decoys whilst he lies under Tarifa before running through the Strait. The &quot;Surprise&quot;, &quot;Ringle&quot; and the blue cutter lie in wait in the Strait. The galley sees three armed ships, and Murad Reis, her captain, fires on the frigate, destroying one gun, and killing Bonden, the coxswain, as well as Hallam, a midshipman. After a long pursuit, the galley hides at Cranc (Crab) island, where &quot;Surprise&quot; and &quot;Ringle&quot;, unable to follow the galley into the shallow lagoon, block the exit. A gun from the &quot;Surprise&quot; is hoisted up a cliff, where it can fire unopposed on the galley. The galley&#x27;s crew, seeing the situation is hopeless, behead Murad and surrender. Returning victorious to Gibraltar, the &quot;Surprise&quot; sees the town exploding fireworks, and learns that Napoleon has lost in the Low Countries, fully beaten. Ali Bey sends word he wants the gold; he is killed and the new Dey, Hassan, admits the xebec fired first, and asks for a loan to consolidate his position in Algiers. The xebec is cleaned up and sent to Algiers, while the gold is shared out in Gibraltar. Barmouth worries that his new wife is too friendly with Aubrey, so he sends him off to the venture in Chile.

==Title==
The title refers to the Hundred Days, a period when Napoleon Bonaparte escaped from Elba and temporarily returned to power in France.

==Reviews==

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; finds brilliantly rendered clashes at sea, yet the strong point of the novel is the &quot;utterly convincing evocation of early 19th-century Europe&quot;. This volume &quot;in the most successful modern series of historical fiction indicates no diminishment of power or inventiveness on the part of its author.&quot; The characters are &quot;realistically aging&quot; and &quot;their victory is not without cost.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; notes that &quot;the prose moves between the maritime sublime and the Austenish bon mot, &quot;a man generally disliked is hardly apt to lavish good food and wine on those who despise him, and Ward&#x27;s dinners were execrable&quot;.&quot; They enjoy O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s staying power as a writer; &quot;O&#x27;Brian continues to unroll a splendid Turkish rug of a saga, and if it seems unlikely that the sedentary Stephen would hunt lions in the Atlas mountains (with the Dey of Algiers!), O&#x27;Brian brings off even this narrative feat with aplomb.&quot;

Paul Kennedy writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; says O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s tales differ from others: &quot;But these naval tales are blended into a larger panorama of Georgian society and politics, science, medicine, botany and the whole conspectus of contemporary Enlightenment knowledge about the natural world.&quot; A key to the success of the novel is &quot;his invention of dual heroes, the bluff and ultracompetent Aubrey being always accompanied by his eccentric ship&#x27;s surgeon, Stephen Maturin&quot;. As this story brings the series to the final end of the Napoleonic wars, Kennedy asks, will this be the last novel? He thinks the closing, when the Admiral bids Aubrey to go to Chile, suggests there is more to come, as the real life of Thomas Cochrane, a sometime model for Aubrey, finds Cochrane in Chile in 1814.

Patrick Reardon writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; says this novel is a bit different from the earlier ones in the series: &quot;a bit unusual for books in the series inasmuch as it has more of a plot&quot;. Like the rest of the series, what gives the novel distinction is the &quot;rendering of the internal lives of the characters--his loving and apt portrayal of their rich mix of feelings and experiences&quot;.

Anthony Day writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; notes that &quot;This is strictly an adventure tale.&quot; To the history of Napoleon&#x27;s victorious return to France, building a huge army in weeks, and a strategy to defeat the allies once joined against him, &quot;O&#x27;Brian has added a clever fictional twist. Muslim mercenaries have gathered in the Balkans willing to join Napoleon&#x27;s forces--for a price. A sheik from a trading post in the Algerian desert holds that price, a nice store of gold.&quot; Of all the intriguing features of this novel, the best part is the &quot;elegant and witty English prose consistent with late 18th-century diction, vocabulary and rhythm.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Independent&quot;, Christina Hardyment feels that a reader will understand less the impact of some aspects of the plot, not having read the earlier books in the series, on account of the importance of the characters: each new book is &quot;letter about a much-loved and ever-growing family of characters in an unerringly authentic and gloriously patriotic setting.&quot; She says of this book &quot;that its recurring leitmotif is one of the subtlest sketchings of deep, deep grief in literature.&quot;

==Series continuity==

This novel begins about six weeks after the end of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot;, after Napoleon arrived in Paris with a large army, the king leaves Paris, and the Allied armies rapidly gather on the continent to engage Napoleon&#x27;s army. Dramatic events in England brought Maturin home; he rejoins the squadron at Funchal.

The story concludes with Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at Waterloo, the final end of the Napoleonic wars until the treaties were signed in July 1815. Aubrey and Maturin set sail for Chile in the &quot;Surprise&quot; to undermine Spanish colonial rule there, promoting the independence movement, to gain an ally for Britain. This is a continuation of the theme started in &quot;The Wine-Dark Sea&quot;. Aubrey meets Captain Christy-Pallière as an ally, after first meeting him as the lieutenant who took him and his ship prisoner in the first novel, &quot;Master and Commander&quot;. Diana&#x27;s diamond of great value, called the Blue Peter, was first mentioned in &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;, used to recover Maturin from a French prison in &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;, pawned in &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; to support their family until Stephen&#x27;s fortune is again available to him to buy it back, and in this novel, the diamond is buried with her.

Sailing to the Adriatic Sea, Aubrey sends Jacob to Kutali to speak with his allies there, to gain the latest information on the rumor from Christy-Palliere, about gold being sent to pay for soldiers who in turn would block the Russian army from joining the armies of the other allies. Aubrey and Maturin made friends in Kutali in &quot;The Ionian Mission&quot;. Links like this emphasize how Aubrey gained both allies and skills over the course of his naval career that serve him well when the war re-starts.

==Deaths of characters in the series of novels==

News of several deaths is received by Maturin and Aubrey in this story. Stephen&#x27;s wife Diana dies, as does Aubrey&#x27;s mother-in-law, Mrs Williams and her equally unpleasant companion, in a crash when Diana&#x27;s daring driving overturns their coach. Diana&#x27;s death leaves Stephen completely shattered, unwilling to eat or speak for long periods of time, but he pulls himself together to foil Napoleon&#x27;s latest plot. Christine Hatherleigh Wood&#x27;s husband, Captain Wood, the colonial governor of Sierra Leone also dies; Dr Glover tells Stephen their marriage was almost a sham given that the husband was impotent. Admiral Lord Stranraer&#x27;s death is reported, as he took too much of the medication on his own choice, after the doctors properly tapered his dosage down. He was introduced in &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; as an influential admiral who spread ill will about Aubrey. Gossip has it the reverse (that the doctors increased the dosage, rather than the patient), likely because he was not a well-liked man.

As part of the last military action in this story, the coxswain for Aubrey, and frequent helper to Maturin, Barret Bonden, is killed instantaneously by the one cannon shot from the xebec. Other crew members are killed too, but none who began with Aubrey in &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, and sailed with him at every chance.

==Historical and scientific references==

There is a theme of the seaman&#x27;s notion of luck and the curiosity of the scientists. Dr Amos Jacob brings aboard a preserved hand exhibiting what is described as palmar aponeurosis - and now known as Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture, named for distinguished surgeon and Maturin&#x27;s friend Baron Guillaume Dupuytren, a hand with the fingers bent inwards and the fingernails growing through the flesh of the palm. It is stored in the alcoholic spirits of wine to preserve it. Stephen Maturin also brings aboard a narwhal tusk given him by Aubrey from a previous Baltic voyage.

The superstitious seamen accept one as a Hand of Glory and the other as a unicorn&#x27;s horn, and regard them as good luck charms. Seamen drink the spirits, leaving the hand much deteriorated, and put out to dry, to see what could be saved. The Marine Captain&#x27;s dog, Naseby, eats the hand, and an emetic only recovers the bones. The narwhal tusk is broken when a drunken Killick and an even more drunken ship&#x27;s boy drop and break it - something that makes the domineering Killick suddenly very unpopular with his shipmates. A measure of goodwill and luck are restored on the ship when Maturin wires the bones together to make a skeletal hand - even more sinister looking, which pleases the crew. Good luck is restored when a marine engineer, Mr Wright, glues the horn back together after he analyses its structure.

The idea and the methods to haul a gun up Cranc island came from a seaman who had been at Diamond Rock near Martinique in 1803, when several guns were brought up to make a secure position.

==Allusion to real places==

Aubrey sails his convoy to Gibraltar, then to Mahón. In seeking out ports with ships to burn or sink, they reach Ragusa Vecchia and next Porte di Spalato on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. In Algiers, Maturin visits the Kasbah, the palace of the Dey. The two-faced Dey promises no gold will sail from Algiers when Maturin saves his life from the attacking lioness, but at the same time directs that the gold sail from Arzila, just southwest of Tangiers, through the Strait of Gibraltar to Durazzo, an Adriatic port. The ship is hidden near Tarifa, the southernmost point of Spain, to the west and south of Gibraltar along the Strait of Gibraltar.

<doc id="659026" wikidata="Q259118" url="?curid=659026" title="Mousterian">
<text>The Mousterian (or Mode III) is an archaeological industry of stone tools, associated primarily with the Neanderthals in Europe, and to the earliest anatomically modern humans in North Africa and West Asia. The Mousterian largely defines the latter part of the Middle Paleolithic, the middle of the West Eurasian Old Stone Age. It lasted roughly from 160,000 to 40,000 BP. If its predecessor, known as Levallois or Levallois-Mousterian, is included, the range is extended to as early as  300,000–200,000 BP. The main following period is the Aurignacian (c. 43,000–28,000 BP) of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

==Naming==
The culture was named after the type site of Le Moustier, three superimposed rock shelters in the Dordogne region of France. Similar flintwork has been found all over unglaciated Europe and also the Near East and North Africa. Handaxes, racloirs, and points constitute the industry; sometimes a Levallois technique or another prepared-core technique was employed in making the flint flakes.

==Characteristics==

The European Mousterian is the product of Neanderthals. It existed roughly from 160,000 to 40,000 BP. 
Some assemblages, namely those from Pech de l&#x27;Aze, include exceptionally small points prepared using the Levallois technique among other prepared core types, causing some researchers to suggest that these flakes take advantage of greater grip strength possessed by Neanderthals.

In North Africa and the Near East, Mousterian tools were produced by anatomically modern humans. In the Eastern Mediterranean, for example, assemblages produced by Neanderthals are indistinguishable from those made by Qafzeh type modern humans. The Mousterian industry in North Africa is estimated to be 315,000 years old.

Possible variants are Denticulate, Charentian (Ferrassie &amp; Quina) named after the Charente region, Typical, and the Mousterian Traditional Acheulian (MTA) Type-A and Type-B. The industry continued alongside the new Châtelperronian industry during the 45,000–40,000 BP period.

==Locations==

*Mousterian artifacts have been found in Haua Fteah in Cyrenaica and other sites in Northwest Africa.
*Contained within a cave in the Syria region, along with a Neanderthaloid skeleton.
*Located in the Haibak valley of Afghanistan.
*Zagros and Central Iran
*The archaeological site of Atapuerca, Spain, contains Mousterian objects.
*Gorham&#x27;s Cave in Gibraltar contains Mousterian objects.
*Uzbekistan has sites of Mousterian culture, including Teshik-Tash.
*Turkmenistan also has Mousterian relics.
*Siberia has many sites with Mousterian-style implements, e.g. Denisova Cave.
*Israel is one of the places where remains of both Neandertals and &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot; have been found in association with Mousterian artifacts.
*Lynford Quarry near Mundford, Norfolk, England, has yielded Mousterian tools.
*The archaeological cave site of Azykh contains Mousterian relics in the overlying strata. In this cave, a lower jaw of a hominid named Azykhantrop has been found. It is supposed that this finding belongs to a pre-neanderthal species.
*The most important sites with significant Neanderthal and Mousterian finds in Croatia are Krapina, Vindija, Velika pećina and Veternica, located in the north-western part of Croatia and the region of Hrvatsko zagorje. Mousterian industry sites on Istrian peninsula are Romualdova pećina and an open-air site at Campanož. Sites on the Adriatic coast and its hinterland are Mujina pećina, with a Mousterian stratigraphic sequence, and Velika pećina in Kličevica with finds approximately 40,000 years old that are late Mousterian. An underwater Mousterian excavation site at Kaštel Štafilić - Resnik recovered about 100 artefacts of which half are tools, Mousterian centripetal cores and side scrapers, several pseudotools, numerous pieces of chert and Levallois method artifacts. Other underwater Paleolithic finds are a single Mousterian tool offshore of Povljana on the island of Pag and stone tools of possible Mousterian type at a depth of 3 m at Stipanac in Lake Prokljan. In the area north of the town of Zadar an extensive series of sites exist where usually small Micro-mousterian industry tools, denticulates and notched pieces are found.

<text>Gatianus (&quot;Catianus, Gatianus, Gratianus&quot;; ) in the third century AD was the founding bishop of the see of Tours. He was one of the &quot;seven apostles of Gaul&quot; commissioned by Pope Fabian to evangelize in the region.

==Life==
According to Christian historians, during the consulship of the Emperor Decius and Vettius Gratus (250 AD), Pope Fabian sent out seven bishops from Rome to Gaul to preach the Gospel: Gatianus to Tours, Trophimus to Arles, Paul to Narbonne, Saturnin to Toulouse, Denis to Paris, Austromoine to Clermont, and Martial to Limoges. A community of Christians had already existed for many years in Lyon, where Irenaeus had been bishop.

As with other founders of the seven Catholic churches of Gaul, especially Martial, Gatianus became confounded in later Christian mythology with the &quot;seventy-two disciples of Christ&quot;, alleged to have been sent into Gaul during the first century, by Peter himself. Other details of his biography, while not as easily disprovable, are also largely legendary. Gregory of Tours, writing in the 6th century, is a more dependable source for the few biographical details concerning his predecessor. According to the Catholic historian Louis Duchesne (&quot;Christian Worship: Its Origin and Evolution&quot;), the traditions preserved at Tours furnished Gregory with only the name of Gatianus and perhaps the 50-year extent of his episcopacy; it was by comparison with a brief early biography of Saturninus of Toulouse () that Gregory arrived at the date 250 for the beginning of Gatianus&#x27; ministry at Tours (&quot;History of the Franks&quot;, 1.30).

There were few Christians in Tours at that time, and in one of the troubled years of his episcopate he is said for a time to have lain concealed in a cave on the banks of the Loire, at a spot where later rose the great Abbey of Marmoutier, and Gregory states that Gratianus would go into the city only when opportunities of preaching presented themselves. He devoted half a century to evangelization, amid innumerable difficulties, and at his death the diocese of Tours was securely established.

In a part of the empire where Mithraism was a dominating force among the legions, Léon Jaud reports that Gatianus likewise retreated into a grotto and there celebrated a mystical banquet (), but that of Christianity. Gatianus was often portrayed officiating at a ceremony in a cavern-like setting. Two grottos cut into the limestone hill above the river Loire, across from Tours at the largely demolished Marmoutier Abbey, are designated the first sites where Gatianus celebrated the liturgy. Anglophile Henry James toured the grottos of Gatianus:
The abbey of Marmoutier, which sprung from the grottos in the cliff to which Saint Gatianus and Saint Martin retired to pray, was therefore the creation of the latter worthy. ...The cliff is still there, and a winding staircase, in the latest taste, enables you conveniently to explore its recesses. These sacred niches are scooped out of the rock, and will give you an impression if you cannot do without one. ...They have been dealt with as the Catholic church deals with most of such places today; polished and furnished up; labelled and ticketed; edited, with notes, in short, like an old book. The process is a mistake. The early editions had more sanctity ... but there was nevertheless a great sweetness in the scene. The afternoon was lovely, and it was flushing to a close. The large garden stretched beneath us, blooming with fruit and wine and succulent vegetables, and beyond it flowed the shining river. The air was still, the shadows were long, and the place, after all, was full of memories, most of which might pass for virtuous. 
Gatianus established a hospice for the poor outside the walls of Tours. There he lay, overcome with weariness, after five decades of fasting, penances and toil. There, Jaud describes Jesus appearing to Gatianus, saying, &quot;Fear not! Thy crown is readied and the Saints await thy arrival in Heaven.&quot;

== Veneration ==
After Gatianus&#x27; death, during renewed persecution of Christians, the see of Tours remained unoccupied for 36 years. The Christians were dispersed and any direct connection with the historical Gatianus was irretrievably broken. Gregory records the second bishop as Lidorius, traditionally credited with building the predecessor of the present cathedral in Tours, and states that he was bishop for 33 years until about the time Saint Martin arrived in Tours in 371 AD. However, Martin found few Christians in this city; local lore nevertheless kept the legend of Gatianus alive. Martin found Gatianus&#x27; burial site, and always venerated his predecessor. With the rise in importance of Paris, Gatianus came to be seen more and more as a disciple of Saint Denis, and is so described at many modern Catholic websites.

Tours became a major pilgrimage site, focused on the tomb of Saint Martin of Tours. The cathedral, originally consecrated to Saint Maurice, was reconsecrated to Saint Gatianus at its 13th century rebuilding. His relics were destroyed in 1793, during the French Revolution. Petty ambitions and little tragedies of mid-19th century provincial life, centered on the cathedral, are portrayed in Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Le Curé de Tours&quot; (&quot;The curate of Tours&quot;).

Saint Gatianus&#x27; day is observed on 18 December.

Saint-Gatien-des-Bois is a commune in Lower Normandy (Calvados), France.

The golf course and the airport at Deauville, schools, and other institutions bear his name.

<text>Kimberly Nichole Wayans (born October 16, 1961) is an American actress. She is the sister of Keenen Ivory, Damon Sr., Marlon, Shawn, and Nadia Wayans and aunt of Damien Dante among others. She is best known for her numerous roles on the Fox sketch comedy show &quot;In Living Color&quot; (1990–94), and Tonia Harris on &quot;In the House&quot; (1995–98). Wayans has also directed episodes for several series, including &quot;Bunk&#x27;d&quot;, &quot;The Neighborhood&quot;, and &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;.

==Early life==
Wayans was born in New York City, the daughter of Elvira Alethia (Green), a homemaker and social worker, and Howell Stouten Wayans, a supermarket manager. Wayans is one of ten siblings, several of whom have become actors and comedians. She and her family lived in New York City&#x27;s Chelsea neighborhood, and were Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Wayans graduated from Wesleyan University, where she studied English.

==Career==
Wayans made her film debut in &quot;Hollywood Shuffle&quot; (1987). Her earliest roles on television included a guest appearance on &quot;China Beach&quot; and as Allison on &quot;A Different World&quot; during its first season. In film, she portrayed minor characters in &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot; (1989) and &quot;A Low Down Dirty Shame&quot; (1994). Both films were directed by her brother Keenen Ivory Wayans. 

She starred with her siblings on the Fox variety show &quot;In Living Color&quot;. Wayans was a part of the cast at its outset in 1990, where she did celebrity impressions of Naomi Campbell, Whitney Houston, Vanessa Williams and Oprah Winfrey.

Regarding original characters, one reviewer opined she was &quot;hysterical&quot; as Mrs. Brooks and another claimed Wayans played Benita Butrell &quot;to perfection.&quot; She left the series along with her brothers Keenen Ivory and Damon in 1993, after a dispute between Fox and the three Wayanses regarding reruns and syndication.

In 1996, Wayans joined the cast of sitcom &quot;In the House&quot; as Tonia. She provided the voice of Mrs. Wayne on short-lived cartoon &quot;Waynehead&quot;. She appeared as Mrs. Johnson in &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood&quot; (1996), and had a starring role in the art film &quot;Talking About Sex&quot;. She also appeared in two episodes as Sheila on &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot; starring her younger brothers Marlon and Shawn. Wayans co-starred in &quot;Juwanna Mann&quot; (2002) as basketball player Latisha Jansen. 

Wayans then worked as a story editor on her brother Damon&#x27;s sitcom &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;. In 2008, she co wrote a series of children&#x27;s books with her husband Kevin Knotts, titled &quot;Amy Hodgepodge&quot;, about a multiracial girl adjusting to life in public school after years of homeschooling.

Known predominantly as a comedian, Wayans claims to have struggled finding roles in other mediums. However, in 2011, she was cast as Audrey, a mother who struggles to understand her seventeen-year-old daughter in the drama film &quot;Pariah&quot;. According to director Dee Rees, Wayans was chosen in the role as she was the only actress to give Audrey &quot;vulnerability&quot; in her audition. Wayans was nominated for a Black Reel Award and NAACP Image Award in 2012, both in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress.

Following &quot;Pariah&quot;, Wayans has acted in more dramatic fare, including guest spots on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. Her turn on the former led to a regular role as paralegal Vi Briggs on &quot;Reckless&quot;. She appeared as a doctor on &quot;The Soul Man&quot; and portrayed Susan on &quot;New Girl&quot;. Wayans returned to sketch comedy, appearing in one episode of &quot;A Black Lady Sketch Show&quot; in 2021.

<text>The Yellow Admiral is the eighteenth naval historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by English author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1996. The story is set in the era of the Napoleonic Wars.

The ships of his squadron are dispersed by the Admiralty as Aubrey&#x27;s two missions (to the slave coast of Africa and up to Ireland&#x27;s west coast) were completed and Aubrey is no longer a commodore. Captain Aubrey is left in command of HMS &quot;Bellona&quot;. He sails her on blockade duty around Brest, France, under an admiral who dislikes him for actions on land and makes trouble for Aubrey in the Royal Navy. On land, he is settled in Woolcombe, the family estate, where he has powers as lord of the manor. Aubrey&#x27;s financial troubles are eased by his capture of a prize. Dr Maturin retrieves his family but not his fortune, and they settle in an empty wing of the Aubrey&#x27;s family estate. As the war against Napoleon looks to be ending, Maturin works out a plan to keep Aubrey at sea on his privately owned ship &quot;Surprise&quot; to chart Chile&#x27;s coast, while Maturin aids the Chilean independence movement. Aubrey suspends himself from the Navy List to avoid the worst career fate, being yellowed, set aside with no squadron of his own, until his reputation can be salvaged, to which end, Napoleon lends a hand by restarting the war.

Critical reception varied, from &quot;taking his readers for granted&quot;, &quot;an interim novel&quot; or &quot;somewhat predictable, nonetheless full of life&quot; to &quot;another excellent adventure&quot; and &quot;the top of his elegant form&quot;. As often happens, reviewers comment on the whole series to date (&quot;virtuosity&quot;, &quot;the best things of their kind&quot;, &quot;uniquely excellent&quot;, &quot;as always lapidary prose&quot;), and are glad this is not the last book in the series, there is more to come, recommending readers new to the series to start it from the first novel. Aubrey&#x27;s relationship with his wife is noted as a strong point of this novel, as is the sly humor and some of the &quot;set pieces&quot;, like the boxing match and actions at sea during the blockade.

==Plot summary==

Aubrey, captain of HMS &quot;Bellona&quot; in the Brest blockade after his squadron was dispersed, is home at Woolcombe, the Aubrey family estate, on parliamentary leave. Three lawsuits from owners of slave ships captured on his mission along the West African coast tie up his funds. His wife Sophia rents out Ashgrove Cottage, their marital home. Maturin returns from Spain with his wife Diana and their household, moving into an empty wing of Woolcombe. Maturin&#x27;s vast wealth is tied up in Spain, where authorities, informed by Jean Dutourd, are displeased at his activities in Peru, a Spanish colony. On land, Aubrey opposes the enclosing of the common, Simmons Lea, which has been proposed in the House by his neighbour, Captain Griffiths. Aubrey has power as lord of the manor, which he uses when the bill is called. Admiral Stranraer on the Brest blockade encouraged this enclosure, and he is uncle to Griffiths. The Admiral calls Aubrey back aboard, hoping to prevent his appearance in Parliament. Quick action on the part of Diana and Clarissa Oakes foils this scheme. Aubrey is watching a boxing match between Barret Bonden and Evans, Griffith&#x27;s gamekeeper, when the orders arrive at Woolcombe. Mrs Oakes appears at the match to tell Aubrey to proceed directly to Parliament. Stranraer is displeased when Aubrey reveals the committee&#x27;s decision; he sends HMS &quot;Bellona&quot; to the inshore blockading-squadron. Aboard the flagship, Maturin receives letters for his covert mission in France. The Admiral tries unsuccessfully to use Maturin to change Aubrey&#x27;s mind.

At the dark of the moon in heavy fog, Aubrey puts Maturin ashore in France with the Catalan agent, Inigo Bernard. Apparently at the same time, two French ships slip through the blockading squadron in the sector that HMS &quot;Bellona&quot; patrols. The Admiral rebukes Aubrey, who accepts no blame, and returns &quot;Bellona&quot; to the offshore squadron. Aubrey receives a letter from Sophie, in which she accuses him of adultery and announces her intention of leaving him, having read letters sent him from Canada by Miss Amanda Smith. Aubrey is spoiling for a fight. During manoeuvres in foggy weather the &quot;Bellona&quot; spots a French privateer chasing a merchantman. She signals to the fleet, and proceeds to take &quot;Les Deux Frères&quot;, which proves a rich prize, having captured two Guinea coast merchant ships. A storm batters the &quot;Bellona&quot;, so Aubrey takes the ship for repair in Cawsand Bay. At Woolcombe, Aubrey asks Sophie for forgiveness, but she rebuffs him. Aubrey sends his tender &quot;Ringle&quot; to report &quot;Bellona&#x27;s&quot; condition to the Admiral. The Admiral then sends &quot;Ringle&quot; to retrieve Maturin from France. Once &quot;Bellona&quot; is repaired, Aubrey rejoins the blockading squadron, learning that &quot;Ringle&quot; has taken Maturin to England. In London, Maturin tells Sir Joseph Blaine about a plot by a Spanish intelligence officer to burgle Blaine&#x27;s house. With the assistance of Mr Pratt, they capture the Spanish agent red-handed. Maturin updates Sir Joseph on the readiness of Chile for independence. They devise a scheme for an expedition led by Aubrey on the &quot;Surprise&quot;. The negative reports from Lord Stranrear with the war winding down put Aubrey in the position of being promoted to rear admiral without a squadron, known informally as being admiral of the yellow; as there is no yellow squadron, it is the worst career fate. Maturin learns his fortune is again available to him. In a gesture to his shipmates, Maturin buys new clothes.

Maturin goes to Woolcombe, where Diana tells him of the issue between Sophie and Jack. She and Clarissa have enlightened Sophie as to the possibility of enjoying sex, even suggesting that she have her own affair. Sophie writes a letter of reconciliation to her husband, which Maturin carries aboard. The letter leaves Aubrey joyous. Admiral Stranraer requests Maturin&#x27;s medical advice; Maturin suggests use of medicines unfamiliar to the flagship&#x27;s surgeon, to good effect. &quot;Bellona&quot; finds the inner squadron fighting two French ships of the line. Upon seeing the &quot;Bellona&quot; and &quot;Grampus&quot;, the French ships retreat. For months, the &quot;Bellona&quot; sweeps the bay, blockading Brest. Maturin tells Aubrey of his plan for Chile, to which Aubrey agrees. &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; comes to visit the inner squadron, with a stores ship to replenish food. The Admiral thanks Maturin for his treatment. The Admiral informs his captains of the progress in the war on land, where Napoleon is making errors and peace talks are underway but not yet successful.

The peace is announced; Napoleon is exiled to Elba. The crew of the &quot;Bellona&quot; are paid off and the ship goes into ordinary storage. Aubrey and Maturin read newspapers to learn world events while they were blockading Brest, and adjust to peace. They agree to a plan with three men from the Chilean independence movement. Aubrey requests suspension from the Navy List, and is put on loan to the hydrographic office. Maturin finances the fitting-out of the &quot;Surprise&quot;, which takes until February 1815. They sail to Madeira with their families aboard. After a brief time on the island, their families will take the packet home. Unexpectecly, Lord Keith, commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, sends orders to Aubrey reinstating him because Napoleon has escaped from Elba. Aubrey takes command of the Royal Navy ships in the harbour of Madeira to blockade the Straits of Gibraltar.

==Series chronology==

This novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the first to line up with historical years, as the first six novels did. Then follow eleven novels beginning with &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot; that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812. As Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, consider an 1812a and 1812b, in the introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series. The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical events of the Napoleonic wars.

==Reviews==

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; found this novel to be &quot;Another excellent adventure, complete with period-piece arcana, for oceanic literature&#x27;s oddest and arguably most appealing couple.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; called &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; &quot;an interim novel&quot; with the best bits in the relations between Aubrey and his wife. Prior novels in this series with portions of the story on land are better when &quot;animated by Maturin&#x27;s intelligence work.&quot; &quot;The Telegraph&quot; finds the topic of protecting his local common from inclosure &quot;by a scheming neighbour is pedestrian in comparison.&quot; Even Maturin&#x27;s wife Diana seems flat in this novel. Aboard ship, the plot revives, &quot;the death of a midshipman has the authentic O&#x27;Brian tang of shocking maritime violence mingled with tenderness.&quot;

In a similar vein, while reviewing a later book in the series, John Casey writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said: &quot;Among O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s fans there was some disquiet when &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; came out. It seemed more diffuse than the earlier installments.&quot;

Terry Teachout writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said he felt &quot;vaguely disappointed by the last three or four installments of the Aubrey-Maturin chronicle, . . . but that &quot;The Yellow Admiral,&quot; while somewhat predictable, is nonetheless full of life.&quot; Viewing the series as a whole, Teachout had two views: the novels &quot;are by a long shot the best things of their kind, so much better than the competition that comparisons long ago ceased to be relevant: they are uniquely excellent, and deserve the widest possible audience.&quot; On the other hand, he said, &quot;Fine as they are, these books are of their kind: brilliant entertainments, rich in implication and almost certainly of permanent interest, yet not quite up to the mark set by Austen and Trollope.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; found splendid storytelling from a true master, specifically &quot;O&#x27;Brian is at the top of his elegant form here.&quot; They highlighted Aubrey&#x27;s challenges in the blockade and with his wife; Maturin scheming with Chilean independence leaders; and the &quot;wealth of sly humor (Navy officers&#x27; talk is &quot;really not fit for mixed company because of its profoundly nautical character&quot;), some splendid set pieces (a bare-knuckle boxing match, lively sea actions), characters who are palpably real and, as always, lapidary prose.&quot;

John Balzar writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that ″Essential to the gift he (O&#x27;Brian) gives is authenticity″. He commented on the series, the &quot;most improbably wonderful series of grown-up literary-historical flights of escapism.&quot; The plots, including the plot of this novel, are of less importance to Balzar, as they &quot;are like grapes to wine: pretty much essential, but not by themselves sublime.&quot; He finds that the writing shows its virtuosity &quot;when a sip of the story actuates the senses and stirs cravings that become habits, no matter where you find yourself being taken.&quot;

Jonathan Yardley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt that O&#x27;Brian was taking his readers for granted in this novel, which was &quot;written for cultists rather than to bring new readers aboard.&quot; Yardley did commend O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s style; &quot;characteristically wry, understated fashion, a style that has much to do with his popularity.&quot;

==Allusion to real events and persons in history==

The Royal Navy had a system of rising through the ranks once a man made Post Captain. As he moved up the list of seniority, if he lived, he would become a Rear Admiral, with a squadron to command. As the Royal Navy grew with the long wars against Napoleon, a break in that practice left some post captains as retired, instead of promoted, or promoted but without a squadron in the Blue, White or Red, hence a yellow admiral. This is what Aubrey feared, taking that as an insult to his life in the Royal Navy with a long record of successes in battles.

Napoleon was losing and winning battles on the ground in 1813 and early 1814, but his western flank was weak, and Wellington&#x27;s army had crossed Portugal and Spain, in April taken Toulouse on its way to Paris. Napoleon agreed to exile on the isle of Elba in April 1814, as its emperor. He slipped off the island about ten months later on 26 February 1815, landing on the coast of France a few days later. He was met by the Fifth Regiment of France south of Grenoble on 7 March 1815; they chose to join forces with him as he marched to Paris.

<text>The Commodore is the seventeenth historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by British author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1995. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.

In this novel, Aubrey and Maturin complete their circumnavigation of the globe begun in &quot;The Thirteen Gun Salute&quot; and continued through &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;, &quot;Clarissa Oakes/The Truelove&quot;, and &quot;The Wine-Dark Sea&quot;. After a long-awaited stay at home in England, Commodore Aubrey is given a squadron to conduct a mission against slave ships in West Africa and then he and Maturin are sent against Napoleon&#x27;s Navy. Dr Maturin finally meets his young daughter, whom he must protect from a vicious enemy agent out to get him through his family. The story ranges from England to Spain to West Africa and the rocky west coast of Ireland.

Reviewers of this novel were impressed with how well the characters were drawn, if you met them, &quot;you&#x27;d know them&quot;. What keeps one reading is the &quot;improbable, delightful friendship between the two men&quot; With part of the story on land, dealing with family issues, the impeccable writing marks O&#x27;Brian as the heir &quot;of Jane Austen herself.&quot; Reardon remarked the strengths of this novel thus: &quot;The book is not so much about battle, although there are some battles. It is not so much about history, although it is filled with the real stuff of the past. It is not even, in the end, about sailing, although it captures with unique clarity the terrible beauty and wondrous excitement, the deep awe and hard work, that are so much the experience of keeping a ship afloat and on its voyage.&quot;

== Plot summary ==
Jack Aubrey wins the &quot;Ringle&quot;, a Baltimore Clipper, from his friend Captain Dundas, as the &quot;Surprise&quot; accompanies HMS &quot;Berenice&quot; back to England, after a stop on Ascension Island for repairs to the &quot;Surprise&quot;. Maturin meets with Sir Joseph Blaine, while Aubrey heads home to his family. When Maturin does reach home with Sarah and Emily, he finds his young daughter Brigid in the care of Clarissa Oakes, now widowed. He searches for his wife, but finds only some of her horses. Their daughter is developing slowly as to language and social skills. 

When Maturin meets Sir Joseph at their club, he learns that the Duke of Habachtsthal, the third conspirator in the Ledward-Wray conspiracy, is aiming at both of them. The Duke&#x27;s influence has delayed the pardons of both Clarissa and Padeen, and all are at risk. To secure his fortune and his family, Maturin asks Aubrey for the &quot;Ringle&quot; to move his cash to Corunna and to carry Clarissa, Padeen and Brigid to live at the Benedictine house in Ávila, Spain, for safety. Brigid takes to Padeen, and is speaking in Irish and English aboard the &quot;Ringle&quot;. Blaine and Maturin separately hire Mr Pratt, to gather information on the Duke and to find Diana.

Aubrey gets orders to command a squadron of ships, a position which earns him promotion to commodore. The mission to disrupt the African slave trade, which is illegal under British law since 1807, is bruited in the English newspapers to be sure the French know of it. The second, secret mission of the squadron is to intercept a French squadron aimed at Ireland, hoping for better success than in 1796-97. Two of the ships in the squadron have captains not up to Aubrey&#x27;s standards: Duff in HMS &quot;Stately&quot; disrupts discipline, while Thomas of HMS &quot;Thames&quot; is not ready for battle. Tom Pullings is the full captain of the flagship HMS &quot;Bellona&quot;, where Aubrey stays and Maturin is surgeon. The &quot;Ringle&quot; meets the squadron at the Berlings off Peniche peninsula. The squadron sails to Freetown to begin the first mission, practising gunnery and other naval skills en route. Aubrey is in a bad mood, felt throughout the ships, until Maturin tells him that Pastor Hinksey is to be married and set up in India; jealousy had gnawed at him. 

Aubrey devises a scheme using the smaller vessels in the squadron to surprise each slave port up to the Bight of Benin. This successfully disrupts the slave trade, and saves over 6,000 slaves. Aubrey ends short of Whydah, as news of the squadron&#x27;s success empties that harbour. They take eighteen slave ships as prizes, first taking the &quot;Nancy&quot;, and using the empty ship for target practice to good effect in Freetown. The success is not without loss of men to disease and attack. Maturin survives a bout of yellow fever contracted while botanizing on Philip&#x27;s Island with Mr Square. As he recuperates, they stop at St Thomas island for medical supplies; two officers (one from &quot;Stately&quot;, one from &quot;Thames&quot;) step ashore for a duel by guns, each fatally wounded, resolving nothing. They reach Freetown again, now in the Harmattan, which is the dry season. The British colonial governor&#x27;s wife invites Maturin to dinner; he is friends with her brother and both are esteemed naturalists. Maturin leaves the potto he had aboard in her care.

Aubrey hastens to meet the French squadron, commanded by the wily Commodore Esprit-Tranquille Maistral, waiting south and east of the point the French are expected to meet the &quot;Caesar&quot; arriving from America. &quot;Caesar&quot; fails to arrive, so they proceed northeast to Ireland. The &quot;Bellona&quot; attacks the French pennant-ship, while the &quot;Thames&quot; and &quot;Stately&quot; attack the other French two-decker ship. The first strikes on a rocky shelf and surrenders; the second badly mauls the &quot;Stately&quot; and flees eastwards. &quot;Thames&quot; is stuck in a reef. HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and &quot;Warwick&quot; handle the four French troop carriers and one frigate, which are penned in a cove. They join the scene of battle, having heard the gunfire. &quot;Bellona&quot; is taking water and Aubrey is glad for the help. The other French frigate slips away. Ashore, Maturin speaks to the Irishmen who want the guns aboard the foundered ship. He and Father Boyle persuade them this is not the moment, as anyone found with the French guns by the British will be hanged. After tending the wounded, Maturin learns from his friend Roche that the flags are at half-staff on account of the death of a minor royal, the Duke of Habachtsthal, who has committed suicide. Maturin, pleased at the news, proceeds to the home of Colonel Villiers, a relative of Diana&#x27;s late husband with whom she is now staying, where he and Diana are happily reunited.

==Series chronology==

This novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the last of eleven novels (beginning with &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;) that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series). The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.

==Reviews==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; has strong words of praise for a mesmerizing performance on many levels, with direct links to Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Perusasion&quot; as to the domestic lives of the main characters, and a writing style marking O&#x27;Brian as the heir &quot;of Jane Austen herself.&quot; The story has a section on land with &quot;the perils of domesticity&quot; as challenges, as well as the dual mission at sea. They particularly noted &quot;Maturin&#x27;s enlightened 18th-century speculations on love, sex, and politics&quot;.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; notes the amount of domestic life in this novel, told with great historical and nautical accuracy. Both Aubrey and Maturin undertake the naval mission with &quot;clouds&quot; from their family affairs.

Joel White, writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, says that compared to some of the earlier novels, &quot;The Commodore&quot; is &quot;relatively peaceful compared with the usual Patrick O&#x27;Brian offering&quot; as to battles. On the other hand, he remarks that &quot;it is not the sea battles that keep us turning the pages, but rather the improbable, delightful friendship between the two men as well as their relationships with their families and shipmates.&quot; The main characters &quot;are complex men, expertly portrayed&quot;, and both leave home for their naval mission unhappy due to family concerns. The naval mission begins on the west coast of Africa to intercept slave ships, the trade already outlawed in England, then moves on to surprise a French expedition. That comes to a conclusion that makes &quot;all right with the world, and the opportunity open for another book to come.&quot;

Patrick Reardon writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; notes the well-drawn characters, so clear that &quot;you&#x27;d know them&quot; if you met them. Further, &quot;The Commodore&quot; is a worthy successor to the 16 earlier Aubrey-Maturin novels that O&#x27;Brian, now in his 80s, has written over the past two decades. The book is not so much about battle, although there are some battles. It is not so much about history, although it is filled with the real stuff of the past. It is not even, in the end, about sailing, although it captures with unique clarity the terrible beauty and wondrous excitement, the deep awe and hard work, that are so much the experience of keeping a ship afloat and on its voyage.&quot; &quot;&quot;The Commodore&quot;, like its predecessors, is about people, seen deep within the context of the exotic and mundane events of their lives.&quot;

== References to actual history ==
The book makes reference to the West African slave trade and the Slave Trade Act 1807. The Act made smugglers of slave traders, putting them at risk of seizure by the Royal Navy. As described in the novel, the slaves removed from the slave ships were not returned to their birthplace or place of seizure, but brought to Freetown in Sierra Leone, where they were not subject to re-capture. Aubrey&#x27;s first sight of slaves aboard a ship designed for that trade deeply affected him, though he did not share Maturin&#x27;s fierce abolitionist views, a way to depict the long struggle to end slavery in the UK and its colonies and territories. The ship &quot;Nancy&quot; as described in the novel is quite similar to the British ship &quot;Brookes&quot; as to the space allotted for the human cargo.

Aubrey is promoted to Commodore, the first flag officer rank. He has a captain under him, so he wears the uniform of a Rear Admiral. This rank came into formal existence in the Royal Navy in 1805, before the setting of this novel, about 1812 or 1813.

==How the Baltimore clipper came to O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s attention==

Ken Ringle of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; interviewed Patrick O&#x27;Brian and kept up correspondence with him. Ringle learned that O&#x27;Brian did not know about the fast sailing type of vessel called the Baltimore clipper, a vessel used by the Americans in the War of 1812. He writes that after December 1992, &quot;when I happened on a new book on Baltimore clippers, I picked up a copy to send him.&quot; Thus the vessel is named &quot;Ringle&quot;, and its amazing sailing properties well-described, and used for critical parts of the plot, like saving Maturin&#x27;s family and fortune.

<doc id="659052" wikidata="Q3754658" url="?curid=659052" title="The Wine-Dark Sea">
<text>The Wine-Dark Sea is the sixteenth historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by British author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1993. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.

This novel constitutes the fourth of a five-novel circumnavigation of the globe; other novels in this voyage include &quot;The Thirteen Gun Salute&quot;, &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;, &quot;Clarissa Oakes/The Truelove&quot;, and &quot;The Commodore&quot;.

The chase of the &quot;Franklin&quot; brings the &quot;Surprise&quot; to Peru and the undercover mission so long delayed. Aubrey navigates through an undersea volcanic eruption, which decides him as winner of the chase. Captain Aubrey&#x27;s illegitimate son, Father Panda, provides crucial help to Maturin in Lima and for his long walk along the Andes Mountains to meet the &quot;Surprise&quot;. Aubrey is unable to beat to windward during a hard blow while trying to reach Maturin to warn him of Dutourd&#x27;s escape and is nearly starved.

This novel received enthusiastic positive reviews on its release. The writing is &quot;literate, leisurely, and as charming as the rest of the series&quot; while the story is &quot;a real hair-raiser&quot;. Another review noted reading the novel &quot;induces a rueful awe at the depth and intensity of the author&#x27;s determination to make his characters authentic creatures of their time&quot;, and praises the &quot;nuanced handling of everyone&#x27;s political and religious beliefs and how these relate to the war they are fighting.&quot; The plot and the writing style were praised: &quot;The naval actions are bang-on and bang-up--fast, furious and bloody--and the Andean milieu is as vivid as the shipboard scenes.&quot; It is this novel that elicited the observation that &quot;The best way to think of these novels is as a single 5,000-page book.&quot; The battles are intense and the storms riveting, but it is the &quot;meticulously recorded mundane moments of the story (and of the sea journey) that bring the novel to full life.&quot; Another reviewer quotes some of the dialogue between Aubrey and Maturin, and remarks that the &quot;painstakingly researched details about 19th-Century life aboard ship, that elevates his tales into heady escapism. O&#x27;Brian won the Heywood Hill Literary Prize, with a cash award, for his writing and for this novel in 1995.

==Plot summary==
The &quot;Surprise&quot;, with bow guns blazing, is in close pursuit of the American privateer &quot;Franklin&quot; in the wine-dark waters of the South Pacific. The chase is interrupted by a submarine volcanic eruption that completely disables the &quot;Franklin&quot;, with lesser damages to the &quot;Surprise&quot;. At sunrise, Aubrey sends Reade to take the &quot;Franklin&quot;; Maturin and Martin separate the dead from wounded aboard the prize. Jean Dutourd, the idealistic French owner, is taken aboard &quot;Surprise&quot;. A wealthy philanthropist, his plan to colonize a South Pacific island, Moahu, as a new utopian society with &quot;Franklin&quot;s passengers as equal citizens was stopped by the appearance of the &quot;Surprise&quot;, and the Admiralty&#x27;s support for the Queen of Moahu in a battle for supremacy on the island. The &quot;Franklin&quot; took prizes of British ships en route to Moahu, proved by ransomers aboard, seamen taken as security, along with cargoes taken. &quot;Franklin&quot;s American sailing master was killed by shots from the &quot;Surprise&quot;. Aubrey finds that Dutourd does not have a letter of marque which would permit him to operate as a privateer. Although the sailing master did, but Dutourd is not listed on his muster. Absent the letter, Aubrey views Dutourd as a pirate, while Maturin considers his talkative nature a risk ashore to his mission. Aboard ship, Dutourd is allowed semi-free access and his utopian talk appeals to some of the seamen.

&quot;Surprise&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot;, with Capt. Pullings, in command, take an American whaler as prize. An ex-British naval sailor on the whaler tells Aubrey of the &quot;Alastor&quot;, a privateer turned true pirate, flying the black flag and demanding immediate surrender or death of its victims. In their ultimately successful encounter with the &quot;Alastor&quot;, Aubrey receives severe wounds to his eye and his leg.

The ships reach Callao, the port for Lima. Maturin&#x27;s mission begins now, done under cover of &quot;Surprise&quot; not being a Royal Navy ship, but perceived as a privateer, and she is again in this port with Pullings as her captain, with many prizes in tow. Maturin&#x27;s goal is to assist the movement for independence of Peru from Spain, with aid from English gold as needed. Father Sam Panda is assigned here, and he proves a useful contact in Maturin&#x27;s work. Another of Maturin&#x27;s tasks ashore is to find suitable care for his longtime assistant, Nathaniel Martin, who is too ill for his work at sea. Maturin sees his old friend Dr Geary, surgeon of &quot;The Three Graces&quot; merchantman, who offers to take Martin home. Martin mistook salt sores (from a period of low fresh water aboard) to be the pox, treating himself with harsh medicines, which in turn made him truly ill. As the hospital in Callao is inadequate, Maturin yields up his patient to Geary.

Maturin meets with Gayongos, revolutionary sympathiser, and departs on a mule into the mountains, to meet with Father Don Jaime O&#x27;Higgins. The plan is agreed and will be set in motion in a couple of days. Gayongos reports at the Benedictine monastery that Dutourd is in Lima; Maturin says, let the Inquisition have him. Maturin sends a message to Pullings that he is gone botanizing in the mountains. He meets Eduardo, knowledgeable Inca guide, and the two trek in the higher altitudes. Eduardo receives a message from Gayongos that the revolution has failed before it began. Maturin must flee by land to Chile. Dutourd is arrested as a heretic, but the damage is done. When Aubrey discovers that Dutourd escaped, he sails in a cutter with a few crewmen to Callao to retake Dutourd or to warn Maturin. After many days of hard sailing against the wind, they reach the harbour and are taken aboard the &quot;Surprise&quot; by Captain Pullings barely alive. Aubrey welcomes Sam Panda who updates him on the political situation and the plan to meet with Maturin. Trekking over the Andes Mountains with llamas, Maturin and Eduardo are caught in a &quot;viento blanco&quot; (blizzard), their lives saved by the shelter Eduardo found, though Maturin loses some toes to frostbite.

Maturin makes his way to Arica with help from Eduardo, and then takes ship to Valparaíso, where Aubrey picks up Maturin and his collections. Maturin informs him of three American China ships sailing from Boston. The &quot;Surprise&quot; sails to intercept them off Cape Horn but, as she prepares to engage them, is herself fired upon by a thirty-eight gun US frigate and her brig. After a very close encounter with an ice island, the &quot;Surprise&quot; is again chased until her pursuer sails into a dead end in the ice field. The &quot;Surprise&quot; sails out, losing her main mast and rudder to a lightning strike. The crew of the jury-rigged &quot;Surprise&quot; spot a ship hull-down on the horizon. The ship, recognized by Maturin as having two rows of cannon, is HMS &quot;Berenice&quot; under Captain Heneage Dundas, accompanied by her tender, and carries Aubrey&#x27;s much younger half-brother Philip. Dundas has provisions to repair the ship and pepper for Maturin to preserve his specimens from moths. Dundas has precious news from home, as he visited Ashgrove Cottage before he sailed, seeing Sophia and their children, but not Diana, only her horses. He met Clarissa Oakes there, who is now a widow. Aubrey and Maturin are happily homeward bound.

==Title==
The novel&#x27;s title is the English translation of an oft-repeated description from Homer. Example of Homer&#x27;s verse: “And if some god should strike me, out on the wine-dark sea, I will endure it,”

==Series chronology==

This novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the tenth of eleven novels (beginning with &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;) that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series). The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.

==Continuity==

In this novel, the voyage begun in &quot;The Thirteen Gun Salute&quot;, with a covert mission (first mentioned in &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot;) in Peru for Maturin, comes finally to Peru. Because of the demands of the Spanish government not to interfere with their colonies in South America, the &quot;Surprise&quot; sailed under Captain Pullings as a privateer, west to Peru, sailing until she met up with Aubrey in the Salibabu Passage in the South China Sea on the other side of the world. Aubrey and Maturin sailed on HMS &quot;Diane&quot; to complete a mission to the east, in Pulo Prabang and Maturin eliminates two traitors to the British cause. Aubrey sails again in the &quot;Surprise&quot;, sending the &quot;Nutmeg&quot; back to Batavia, where the Governor had given it to him (&quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;). &quot;Surprise&quot; proceeds to Australia, picking up a friend and a stowaway. The Governor at Sydney sends Aubrey on a mission to Moahu, successfully completed (&quot;Clarissa Oakes / The Truelove&quot;). &quot;Surprise&quot; chases and takes the American privateer &quot;Franklin&quot; in this novel, bringing &quot;Surprise&quot; to Peru, where Maturin&#x27;s mission, so close to success, is jeopardized, and Maturin walks the Andes Mountains until he can reach the coast safely and rendezvous with &quot;Surprise&quot;. They sail around the Cape Horn, suffering damage from lightning, but meet with HMS &quot;Berenice&quot;, with supplies to repair her, and Aubrey and Maturin are ready to be home after the long voyage around the world.

==Reviews and awards==
By the time of the publication of this novel by WW Norton jointly with HarperCollins, reviewers have read the series in order and have caught up with the plot, ending the confusion seen in reviews of novels earlier in the series, reviews written at the time of re-issue, not at first publication. There are more reviews in newspapers of note.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said this novel is literate, leisurely, and as charming as the rest of the series. Sending Maturin to deal with the tottering Spanish vice regency in South America is a good choice, aboard the privateer &quot;Surprise&quot;. &quot;Maturin&#x27;s mission, complicated enough by the various revolutionary factions, becomes a real hair-raiser involving an arduous transit of the Andes, where he is spit on by llamas and sees the great condors.&quot;

Thomas Fleming writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s persistence . . . eventually induces a rueful awe at the depth and intensity of the author&#x27;s determination to make his characters authentic creatures of their time. It is life aboard the &quot;Surprise&quot; that mainly animates O&#x27;Brian. His narrative of the proto-revolution in Peru is sketchy at best. . . . This deficiency is more than balanced by the intricate intimacy with which the reader comes to know the &quot;Surprise&quot;. . . . Equally fine is O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s nuanced handling of everyone&#x27;s political and religious beliefs and how these relate to the war they are fighting.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; remarks that If O&#x27;Brian hasn&#x27;t quite had a break-out book yet, then this deserves to be it. In an enthusiastic review, they describe the writing: &quot;The naval actions are bang-on and bang-up--fast, furious and bloody--and the Andean milieu is as vivid as the shipboard scenes. As usual, readers can revel in the symbiotic friendship of Jack and Stephen, who make for a marvelous duo, whether in their violin and cello duets or in their sharp dialogue.&quot;

Patrick T Reardon writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; describes how the author brings this story to full life: &quot;The best way to think of these novels is as a single 5,000-page book. But this is no overstuffed epic. It is, if you can imagine such a thing, an intimate book that just happens to be 5,000 pages long. . . . As usual, O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s battle scenes are engrossing, and his storm chapters are even more riveting. But it&#x27;s the in-between times, the closely observed and meticulously recorded mundane moments of the story (and of the sea journey) that bring the novel to full life.&quot;

Paul D Colford, writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, cites a quote from the story as an example of the fine prose and painstaking research by the author that elevates this book, and the series to a higher level.

Here, in &quot;The Wine-Dark Sea&quot;, are the two old friends as they puzzle from the quarterdeck at a &quot;strange-coloured&quot; swirling sea:
Aubrey: &quot;I have never seen anything like it.&quot;
Maturin: &quot;It is much thicker now than it was when I went below. And now an umber light pervades the whole, like a Claude Lorrain run mad.&quot;
It&#x27;s this kind of passing historical reference (to the 17th-Century landscape artist known for his rendering of light), as well as O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s painstakingly researched details about 19th-Century life aboard ship, that elevates his tales into heady escapism.

Author Patrick O&#x27;Brian won the Heywood Hill Literary Prize in 1995, the first such prize offered, for his literary contributions and this novel. In his acceptance speech in July 1995, O&#x27;Brian, then age 80, said it was the first literary prize of his adult life, in the amount of 10,000 pounds.

==Allusions to history, natural science, real places and persons==
Crew members recruited from Shelmerston, the fictitious port on the west coast of England, report a large number of religious sects. One such is the group called Knipperdollings, a group who do not hold to the precepts of the first such group centuries earlier, but took the name to identify their beliefs apart from others. Martin gives Aubrey a full detailed history of the Knipperdolling beliefs then and on the ship.

Maturin mentions the Viennese treatment for the pox (venereal diseases), saying it relies on &quot;murias hydrargi corrosivus&quot;, which is a corrosive compound of mercury.

Dutourd asks Maturin if he knew Georges Cuvier, a well-known anatomist and natural philosopher in Paris.

In his botanizing walks up into the high Andes Mountain peaks, Maturin is delighted to see numerous condors, a puma, huge flowering bromeliads and to see and then learn the difference between guanacos and vicuñas. In the long trek out of Peru, llamas are used, a domesticated breed, which took some time to stop spitting at Maturin.

The Vicar General (a Catholic priest) with whom Father Sam Panda works has the last name O&#x27;Higgins, and is suggested to be a relative of Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, who was fighting for Chilean independence from Spanish colonial rule since 1810.

Aubrey mentions the Spanish Disturbance in Nootka Sound (off Vancouver Island) in 1789 as being a year with good effects in his life. After the loss in the American Revolution, the Royal Navy left midshipman and officers &quot;on the beach&quot;. The Nootka crisis took some years to be resolved, on the question of which European power has rights to North and South American lands, if there is no settlement from that European power on the land. The Royal Navy stepped up its ship making, and in 1792 allowed master&#x27;s mate Aubrey to pass for Lieutenant and get a berth on ship, at the same time readying the Royal Navy for the long war against France.

The port town at Callao is real, as is Lima, up higher in the mountains from Callao; in current times, the two are part of one urbanized area. The Andes Mountains are noted for many high peaks and passes, with an average height throughout the long range of 4,000 m (13,000 ft). Maturin and Eduardo viewed Lake Titicaca and its wildlife. Such high altitudes can strain breathing; the coca leaves that Maturin liked to chew, something he learned on his first visit to Peru, make it easier to stand the altitude. Maturin and Eduardo drank mate as they walked, which is a tea made from the coca leaf. Maturin came down from the mountains at Arica, a port now in Chile but then considered part of Peru. He made his way to the appointed meeting place at Valparaiso, a major port city in Chile.

It is in this book that the drawing of a sailing ship of this era is added to the print copies. &quot;Far more confusing to newcomers may be some of the nautical and scientific dialogue the characters exchange. O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s publishers have equipped the book with a drawing of the &quot;Surprise&quot;, numbering 21 sails, from the flying jib to the mizzen topgallant staysail. But that hardly prepares the unwary for Captain Aubrey and his crew&#x27;s discussions of recondite items like cross-catharpins, dumb-chalders, side-trees, heel-pieces, side-fishes, cheeks, front-fish and cant-pieces.&quot;

The popularity of the series has expanded beyond a small group of devoted fans, as the author is invited to visit the US, where many distinguished readers of his newly discovered series wait to meet him. Paul D. Colford notes that when he &quot;visited the United States a few weeks ago, fans waiting to meet, lunch and have tea with him included Walter Cronkite, Sen. Dirk Kempthorne (R-Idaho) and Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who invited O&#x27;Brian to attend a session of the high court. Hollywood also wants a piece of the press-shy storyteller.&quot; The activities of US publisher W. W. Norton &amp; Company are mentioned as part of the increase in popularity: &quot;Norton also plans to keep stoking interest in O&#x27;Brian by reissuing all his books in hardcover starting in the spring and by bringing out two additional titles in April.&quot; This process of discovery by W. W. Norton was begun in 1990, and mentioned in the article on &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;.

<doc id="659058" wikidata="Q3679057" url="?curid=659058" title="Clarissa Oakes">
<text>Clarissa Oakes (titled The Truelove in the United States) is the fifteenth historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by British author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1992. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.

This novel constitutes the third of a five-novel circumnavigation of the globe; other novels in this voyage include &quot;The Thirteen Gun Salute&quot;, &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;, &quot;The Wine-Dark Sea&quot;, and &quot;The Commodore&quot;.

Glad that the penal colony is behind him, Captain Aubrey discovers a stowaway prisoner aboard near Norfolk Island. He deals with her before he allows the cutter from the governor at New South Wales to deliver his new orders to handle a political situation on a Pacific island. En route, Maturin learns the key to finding the high level agent giving British information to the French, while Aubrey addresses the unhappy crew of &quot;Surprise&quot;.

One reviewer finds this novel a pure joy to read as it shares unmistakably original insights into the mysteries of the world. &quot;His books add up to a portrait of an entire world, containing every single aspect of human life.&quot; Specifically, the title character Clarissa Oakes &quot;gives O&#x27;Brian a chance to explore their [Aubrey and Maturin&#x27;s] characters in exceptional depth.&quot; One reviewer compared O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s writing style to that of several famous writers, considering that he has left C S Forester far behind, and is &quot;one of the best storytellers afloat,&quot; with use of nautical detail that is &quot;unalloyed, unapologetic and absolutely right.&quot; Another called it &quot;intelligent escape&quot; as reading material, while another found that it &quot;will delight fans.&quot;

==Plot summary==
&quot;Surprise&quot; sails eastbound from Port Jackson in New South Wales. Jack Aubrey is in an ill-humour as a result of the frigate&#x27;s visit to the abysmal penal settlement – firstly, because Stephen Maturin&#x27;s duel with an army officer antagonized the local administration until the governor returned, and secondly because Padeen Colman, Maturin&#x27;s servant and an absconder, was rescued against Aubrey&#x27;s wishes. Aubrey observes ribaldry amongst his crew and remains puzzled until he and Pullings find a young female convict, Clarissa Harvill, during the ship&#x27;s inspection. She was smuggled aboard in Sydney Cove by Midshipman Oakes. Aubrey is at first determined to leave them both on Norfolk Island, but lets them stay aboard until they reach a safer port.

&quot;Surprise&quot; spots a cutter, . Aubrey suspects the cutter seeks the runaways. He agrees that Harvill and Oakes may marry on board. Aubrey gives some fine red silk he bought for Sophie to be used for a wedding dress for Clarissa, who wears midshipman&#x27;s clothes. Martin conducts the ceremony, while Bonden hides Padeen. The cutter bears dispatches for Aubrey and mail for the ship, and a captain whose father was surgeon on &quot;Surprise&quot;, eager to see her. The mail brings many letters from Sophia and from Diana. Aubrey sees Maturin&#x27;s happiness that his daughter was born, while Sophia writes him that the infant has development troubles, a secret to keep from Maturin. The governor orders Aubrey to settle a local dispute on Moahu, a nominally British island to the south of the Sandwich Islands. The gun room feasts the newlyweds. Despite the delicious swordfish speared by Davies (after it pierced the ship), good conversation is impaired by the level of animosity existing amongst the gun room members, most visibly West and Davidge. The cause is jealousy over Clarissa, who has had sexual liaisons with several of the ship&#x27;s officers. This ill-will spreads to the crew, who divide in pro-and anti-Clarissa factions. In the blue water sailing, Maturin befriends Clarissa Oakes.

The ship spots a British whaler at the island of Annamooka in Tonga. Wainright, captain of &quot;Daisy&quot;, tells Aubrey about the situation on Moahu. There is a war between Kalahua in the north and Puolani in the south, with the northern chief being supported by the armed privateer &quot;Franklin&quot;, sailing under the American flag, owned by Jean Dutourd of Louisiana, and Britain is at war with America. The privateer has captured &quot;Truelove&quot;, a British whaler. While the crew provisions &quot;Surprise&quot;, Clarissa, who has received a black eye from Oakes, confesses to Maturin on their botanizing walk together about her being sexually abused as a young girl and later working as a bookkeeper and occasional prostitute at a brothel in Piccadilly. These experiences formed her sexual outlook, indifference to something that gives no pleasure. Maturin explains the jealousy of men to her. When she mentions that she saw an aristocratic acquaintance of the late turncoats Ledward and Wray at the brothel, Maturin realises that he is the highly placed traitor long sought by Sir Joseph Blaine and Maturin. He sends a coded letter to Blaine via Wainwright.

Aubrey drives his frigate&#x27;s crew hard on the trip to Moahu due to their poor showing at Annamooka. On reaching Moahu, they meet &quot;Truelove&quot;, now their prize, and a column is sent to intercept the fleeing French. The skirmish is won but Davidge and others are killed, with no survivors among the French. &quot;Surprise&quot; then sails to the south of the island to defend Queen Puolani against the main body of French and Kalahua&#x27;s tribesmen, as she agrees to accept the protection of King George III. Aubrey sets up carronades in a cleft and there is a terrific slaughter of the enemy the following day. That night, after a great feast, Aubrey welcomes the queen to his bed. &quot;Truelove&quot; departs, commanded by Oakes, with Clarissa on board bearing a copy of the letter to Blaine with her. Aubrey gives funds to Oakes, while Maturin gives funds to Clarissa, separately, for their passage to England. &quot;Franklin&quot; appears but sails away immediately, with &quot;Surprise&quot; giving chase.

==Title in the US==
&quot;Clarissa Oakes&quot; was published in the U.S. as &quot;The Truelove&quot;, which is the name of a ship in the novel.

==Series chronology==

This novel references actual historical events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the ninth of eleven novels (beginning with &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;) that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series). The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.

==Reviews==

Dick Adler writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; has high praise for this novel, finding it &quot;a pure joy to read-on its own or as part of the glorious whole. It was published in England as &quot;Clarissa Oakes&quot;, which probably sounded too Jane Austen-ish to American editorial ears. But it&#x27;s a perfect title, because the slim and lively girl who stows away on the HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; as it sails from Botany Bay is the real heart of O`Brian&#x27;s moving and erotic story.&quot; Adler feels that Clarissa Oakes&#x27; presence &quot;gives O`Brian a chance to explore their [Aubrey and Maturin&#x27;s] characters in exceptional depth.&quot; The story has &quot;plenty of action, including a remarkable battle with cannibals in which O`Brian sums up all the horror in one unforgettable image.&quot;

Adler concludes that &quot;what lifts &quot;The Truelove&quot; into the highest ranks of fiction is what it shares with the rest of its author&#x27;s writing: page after page of unmistakably original insights into the mysteries of the world.

Anthony Bailey, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, finds that this novel puts the reader &quot;on board the &quot;Surprise&quot; in the South Pacific in the early 19th century amid a swirl of nautical detail, unalloyed, unapologetic and absolutely right.&quot; in a novel written by &quot;one of the best storytellers afloat&quot;. He suggests that with his first novel in this series, O&#x27;Brian may have been competing with C. S. Forester, but &quot;At this point, he is in a different squadron altogether, providing pleasure for those who will never be able to read a new Captain Marryat (the author, in the 1830s and 1840s, of a number of sea adventures) – but in this instance a Marryat with a touch of Jane Austen, Erskine Childers and John le Carré thrown in.&quot; The relationship between the principal characters is &quot;One of the delights of these books&quot;, where &quot;Aubrey is a sailor in his blood and bones&quot; and Maturin &quot;remains a landlubber the non-seafaring reader can identify with.&quot; Bailey notes the use of letters home, a device used also by William Golding in his sea-faring trilogy &quot;To the Ends of the Earth&quot;, and finds that &quot;O&#x27;Brian while telling his yarn writes like a man simply at home in a 500-ton frigate. All the naval minutiae of the early 19th century are evidently in his grasp, but like the &quot;Surprise&#x27;s&quot; maintopsails, they are used to drive the book forward, a great show that also has cumulative effect.&quot; Bailey highlights many aspects of the plot, which issues are addressed by Aubrey, and which are handled by Maturin, and notes that in this novel, the officers have a particularly varied diet, including &quot;a suicidal swordfish, soused pig&#x27;s face and a Polynesian stew in which a human ear floats.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; finds this novel to be &quot;Intelligent escape. Not for the rushed.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; feels this novel &quot;will delight fans, while offering newcomers a good place to jump in.&quot;

==Allusion to real places==

The plot takes the ship to a fictional island south of the Hawaiian Islands, which were first known as the Sandwich Islands.

<doc id="659059" wikidata="Q5957666" url="?curid=659059" title="Hyper engine">
<text>The hyper engine was a 1930s study project by the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) to develop a high-performance aircraft engine that would be equal to or better than the aircraft and engines then under development in Europe. The project goal was to produce an engine that was capable of delivering 1 hp/in3 (46 kW/L) of engine displacement for a weight of less than 1 lb/hp delivered. The ultimate design goal was an increased power-to-weight ratio suitable for long-range airliners and bombers.

At the time, no production engine could come close to the requirements, although this milestone had been met by specially modified or purpose-built racing engines such as the Napier Lion and Rolls-Royce R. A typical large engine of the era, the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp radial, developed about 1,200 hp (895 kW) from 1,830 in3 (30 L) so an advance of at least 50% would be needed. Simply scaling up an existing design would not solve the problem. While it would have increased the total available power, it would also increase the weight, and thus not have any significant effect on the power-to-weight ratio. To meet the goals, more radical changes were needed.

Several engines were built as part of the hyper program, but for a variety of reasons none of these saw production use. Air-cooled engines from a variety of US companies were delivering similar power ratings by the early 1940s, and the licensed production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin as the Packard V-1650 provided hyper-like performance from an inline while the Allison V-1710 did the same from a US design, one produced as a private effort outside the hyper program.

==Design and development==
Improvements in construction and lighter materials had already delivered some benefits on the way to higher power-to-weight ratios. Aluminum was being introduced in place of steel as the quality and strength of aluminum alloys improved during the 1930s; this lowered engine weight noticeably, but not enough to achieve a 50% overall improvement. To reach that goal, the power of the engine would also need to be increased. Power is a combination of energy and the rate it is delivered, so to improve the power-to-weight ratio, one would need to increase the operating pressures of the engine, the operating speed, or a combination of both. Further gains could be made by eliminating losses like friction, combustion inefficiencies and scavenging losses, delivering more of the theoretical power to the propeller.

The USAAC engineers determined that it would study all three improvements. Before long, they concluded that increasing the combustion temperature and scavenging efficiency promised the greatest increases of all of the possibilities. To meet that goal, increasing engine speed seemed to be the most attractive solution. However, there were a number of practical problems that were impeding progress in these areas.

Increasing the compression ratio is an easy change that improves the mean effective pressure (MEP), but leads to engine knocking from inconsistent detonation. Uncontrolled, knock can damage the engine and was a major block on the way to improved power settings. This change would also increase the operating temperatures, which presented a problem with the valves. Valves were already reaching temperatures that would cause pre-ignition of the fuel as it flowed past them.

Increasing operational speed is also, theoretically, a simple change to the engine design. However, at high operating speeds the valves do not completely close before the cam opens them again, a problem called &quot;valve float&quot;. Valve float allows gases in the cylinder to escape through the partially open valve, reducing the engine efficiency. Increasing valve spring pressure to close the valves faster led to rapid cam wear and increased friction, reducing overall performance by more than any horsepower gained.

As valves were a key issue in both approaches to improved performance, they had been a major area of research in the 1920s and 30s. In the UK, Harry Ricardo had written an influential paper on the sleeve valve system for exactly these reasons, claiming it was the only way forward. He had some success in selling this idea, most notably to Bristol Aeroplane Company Engines, where Roy Fedden became &quot;a believer&quot;. Ricardo&#x27;s friendly competitor, Frank Halford, designed his own sleeve valve engine with Napier &amp; Son, another prominent British engine maker.

The USAAC was not so convinced that the sleeve valve was the only solution. Ironically it was one of Ricardo&#x27;s papers on the sleeve valve design that led to the USAAC&#x27;s hyper engine efforts. In one late 1920s paper he claimed that the 1 hp/in³ goal was impossible to achieve with poppet valve type engines. The USAAC engineering team at Wright Field decided to test this claim by beating it. They proposed an engine of about 1200 in3 (20 L), hoping the engine&#x27;s smaller size would lead to reduced drag and hence improved range.

===Hyper No. 1===

Sam Heron, head of development at Wright Field and a former colleague of Ricardo while Heron had been working at the Royal Aircraft Factory, Farnborough, started working on the problem with a single-cylinder test engine that he converted to liquid cooling, using a Liberty L-12 engine cylinder. He pushed the power to brake mean effective pressure, and the coolant temperature to before reaching the magic numbers. By 1932, the USAAC&#x27;s encouraging efforts led the Army to sign a development contract with Continental Motors Company for the continued development of the engine design. The contract limited Continental&#x27;s role to construction and testing, leaving the actual engineering development to the Army.

Starting with the L-12-cylinder, they decreased the stroke from 7 inches to 5 inches to allow higher engine speeds, and then decreased the bore from 5 inches to 4.62 inches, creating the 84 in³ cylinder. This would be used in a V-12 engine of 1008 in³ displacement. They used the L-12&#x27;s overhead camshaft to operate multiple valves of smaller size, which would improve charging and scavenging efficiency. Continental&#x27;s first test engine, the single-cylinder Hyper No. 1, first ran in 1933.

They eventually determined that exhaust valves could run cooler when a hollow core filled with sodium is used—the sodium liquefies and considerably increases the heat transfer from the valve&#x27;s head to its stem and then to the relatively cooler cylinder head where the liquid coolant picks it up.

Liquid cooling systems at that time used plain water, which limited operating temperatures to about . The engineers proposed using ethylene glycol, which would allow temperatures up to . At first they proposed using 100% glycol, but there was little improvement due to the lower specific heat of the glycol (about 2/3 that of water). They eventually determined that a 50/50 mixture (by volume) of water and glycol provided optimal heat removal.

===Hyper No.2===

A second cylinder was added to Hyper No. 1 to make a horizontal opposed engine for evaluation of an horizontal opposed 12-cylinder engine. After running the modified engine with different combinations of cylinder bore and stroke, it was found that the high coolant temperature required to maintain the required output was impractical. A third high-performance single-cylinder engine was then constructed with lower operating parameters. This engine was designated &quot;Hyper No. 2&quot;, and became the test bed for developing the cylinders that would become the O-1430-1.

===Continental O/V/IV/XIV-1430===
The Army apparently became concerned about the development of a suitable supercharger for high-altitude use, and for further development in 1934 they asked for a newer cylinder with slightly less performance and an increased volume of 118.8 in3 from its bore and stroke. This size cylinder would then be used in a 1,425 in3 12-cylinder engine, delivering the same 1,000 hp, with a performance of 0.7 hp/in3. This placed its performance on a par with newer experimental engines from Europe like the Rolls-Royce PV-12, at least when running on the higher-octane fuels the Army planned to use.

Another change was to the engine layout. The Army, convinced that future aircraft designs would use engines buried in the wings for additional streamlining, asked Continental to design a full-sized flat-horizontally opposed engine for installation inside a wing. The resulting engine was the Continental O-1430, which would require a ten-year development period which changed the layout to first an upright V-12 engine and later, an inverted V-12 engine before becoming reliable enough to be considered for full production as the Continental IV-1430 in 1943. By then other engines had already passed its 1,600 hp (1,200 kW) rating, and although the IV-1430 had a better power-to-weight ratio, there was little else to suggest setting up production in the middle of the war was worthwhile.

The project was eventually guided by the requirements in the &quot;Request for data R40-C&quot;, which was included as a part of the Financial Year (FY) 1940 aircraft procurement program.

==Request for data R40-C==

As 1938 came to an end, war in Europe was imminent. At this point, European aircraft had greatly surpassed US designs. The two top USAAC fighters, the Seversky P-35 and the Curtiss P-36A, were just able to hit . Against the Messerschmitt Bf 109 they would be completely outclassed. One of America’s answers to this issue, the twin-engined Lockheed XP-38, was entering an extended test program.

Although the XP-38 was able to fly at speeds in excess of , its twin engines and relatively large frame meant it was large and heavy. This, in turn, meant the XP-38 was not as maneuverable as most single-engine fighters. The XP-38 also had a newly introduced liquid-cooled engine, the Allison V-1710. The Allison&#x27;s in-line vee cylinder arrangement allowed for a narrow aerodynamic shape that had less drag than the air-cooled radial engine fighters that predominated in America at the time.

The fighter aircraft procurement program for FY 1940 was contained in a document that was approved by Assistant Secretary of War Louis K. Johnson on 9 June 1939. That document was the &quot;Request for Data R40-C&quot;, and unlike previous aircraft procurement requests, it was sent to only a limited number of aircraft manufacturers. The original document was to be sent to:
* Bell Aircraft Corporation
* Consolidated Aircraft Corporation
* Curtiss-Wright Corporation Curtiss Airplane Division
* Curtiss-Wright Corporation, St. Louis Airplane Division
* Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation
* Lockheed Aircraft Corporation
* Republic Aviation Corporation
* Vought-Sikorsky Aircraft Division, United Aircraft Corporation
* Vultee Aircraft Division, Aviation Manufacturing Corporation

After final review and approval as Air Corps Type Specification XC-622, a further four manufacturers were added to the distribution:
* Hughes Aircraft Corporation
* McDonnell Aircraft Company
* Boeing Aircraft Company
* Northrop Aircraft, Incorporated

These companies had only ten days to agree to the terms of the document, and only 30 days to submit their designs.

===FY 1940===
A total of 26 designs, with a mix of 16 engine models from six engine companies, were submitted by seven of the selected companies. These engines became known as the &quot;Hyper Engines&quot;, a contraction of High-performance engines. The submitted designs were graded using a &quot;Figure of merit&quot; (FOM) rating system, and then, using the FOM results (which ranged from 444.12 for the Allison V-1710-E8 to 817.90 for the Pratt and Whitney X-1800-A4G), they were separated into one of three groups.

* Those placed in the first group were little more than modifications to existing designs. They were not considered to be sufficiently advanced.
* Those placed in the third group proposed using an engine that was unlikely to be developed into flying condition by the time the airframe was ready to fly. They were not considered to be viable in the time frame allowed.
* The remaining ten designs were placed in the second group: those that were an advancement in aeronautical engineering, with an engine that would be ready to fly, when needed.

Only three of these ten designs were approved, and contracts were made for a limited prototype run of three aircraft for each.

The three aircraft/engine combinations that were selected:
# Vultee Aircraft&#x27;s Model 70 Alternate 2, (FOM score: 817.9), which became the Vultee XP-54, powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney X-1800-A4G engine
# Curtiss-Wright St Louis Model P248C, (FOM score: 770.6), which became the Curtiss-Wright XP-55 Ascender, powered by the Continental IV-1430-3 engine
# Northrop&#x27;s Model N2-B (FOM score: 725.8), which became the Northrop XP-56 Black Bullet, powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney X-1800-A3G engine

===FY 1941===
Three additional high-performance engines were considered for the USAAC&#x27;s FY 1942 &quot;Hyper&quot; engine procurement program. They were:
* Wright R-2160 &quot;Tornado&quot;
* Pratt &amp; Whitney H-3130
* Allison V-3420

Not to be left out, the US Navy selected the Lycoming XH-2470 for funding in FY 1942 as well.

==Program end==
In the end, all of these programs were canceled, and the surviving engines became museum pieces.

Ironically, engines that were not considered under the program; the Allison V-1710, Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp, Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone and Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major, all surpassed the USAAC requirements, and continue flying into the 21st century, primarily flying restored warbird aircraft.

<text>Marquess of Ripon, in the County of York, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1871 for the Liberal politician George Robinson, 2nd Earl of Ripon.

==History==
The Robinson family descended from William Robinson (d. 1616), a wealthy York merchant, Lord Mayor and Member of Parliament for York. His grandson Sir William Robinson also represented York in Parliament and served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1638. Sir William&#x27;s elder son Metcalfe Robinson sat as Member of Parliament for York and was created a Baronet in 1660 (see Robinson Baronets). He died childless in 1689 when the baronetcy became extinct. The title was revived in the following year when his nephew William Robinson was created a Baronet, of Newby in the County of York, in the Baronetage of England. Sir William represented both Northallerton and York in Parliament. His eldest son Metcalfe, the second Baronet, only survived him by four days and was succeeded by his younger brother, Tancred, the third Baronet. He was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy. This line of the family failed on the death of his younger son, the fifth Baronet, in 1792.

The late Baronet was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, Thomas Robinson, 3rd Baron Grantham, who became the sixth Baronet. He was the grandson of Thomas Robinson (fourth son of the first Baronet), a prominent diplomat and politician who served as Ambassador to the Austrian Empire, as Secretary of State for the Southern Department and as Leader of the House of Commons; in 1761 he was created Baron Grantham, of Grantham in the County of Lincoln, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron, who was also a successful diplomat and politician who served as Ambassador to Spain and as Foreign Secretary. Lord Grantham married Lady Mary Jemima, daughter of Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke, and Jemima Yorke, 2nd Marchioness Grey and 4th Baroness Lucas, granddaughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent.
He was succeeded by his elder son Thomas, the aforementioned third Baron Grantham. In 1803 Thomas assumed the surname of Weddell in lieu of his patronymic. In 1833 he succeeded his maternal aunt as 2nd Earl de Grey and 6th Baron Lucas. His aunt Lady Amabel (or Annabella) Yorke had succeeded her mother the Marchioness Grey (on whose death the marquessate became extinct) in the barony of Lucas in 1797 and in 1816 she was created Countess de Grey, of Wrest in the County of Bedford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with remainder to her sister Lady Mary Jemima and the heirs male of her body. Lady de Grey was the childless widow of Alexander Hume-Campbell, Lord Polwarth, son of Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont. Thomas, the second Earl de Grey, also inherited the Grey family seat of Wrest Park, near Silsoe in Bedfordshire. The same year he succeeded to the earldom, he assumed by Royal licence the surname of de Grey in lieu of Weddell.

Lord de Grey had no sons and was succeeded in the barony of Lucas (which could be passed on through female lines) by his daughter, Anne (see Baron Lucas for further history of this title). He was succeeded in the other titles by his nephew, George Robinson, 2nd Earl of Ripon. He was the only son of the Honourable F. J. Robinson, second son of the second Baron Grantham. F. J. Robinson was Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1823 and 1827, and he served briefly as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between August 1827 and January 1828. In 1827 he was elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Viscount Goderich, of Nocton in the County of Lincoln. This was a revival of the viscountcy of Goderich created for his great-great-grandfather the Duke of Kent in 1706. In 1833 Robinson was further honoured when he was made Earl of Ripon, in the County of Kent in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. On his death in 1859 he was succeeded by his only son, the aforementioned second Earl of Ripon. The latter also succeeded his uncle in the earldom of de Grey later in 1859, whereby he became known by the style of &quot;Earl de Grey and Ripon&quot;. He was a distinguished Liberal statesman and held office in every Liberal administration from 1861 until his death in 1908. In 1871 he was created Marquess of Ripon, in the County of York in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his only son and only surviving child, the second Marquess. He represented Ripon in Parliament between 1874 and 1880. He was childless, therefore all the titles became extinct upon his death in 1923. The second Marquess was regarded as the finest shot of his generation.

The family seats were Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, and Newby Hall and Studley Royal Park in Yorkshire

<doc id="659064" wikidata="Q16386900" url="?curid=659064" title="Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!">
<text>Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now! is a 1972 children&#x27;s book by Dr. Seuss. Written as a book for early beginning readers, it is suitable for children who can not yet read at the level of more advanced beginning books such as &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. The book presents, in short and funny fashion, Dr. Seuss&#x27;s nonsensical words, rhymes, and illustrations. 

It is not entirely clear what the story is about but is known to have a similar ending to Green Eggs and Ham. One popular interpretation of the story, given Marvin is wearing purple pajamas, is that he is being told to go to bed by his parent, though the story was designed to be ambiguous in nature.

== Story ==
Marvin K. Mooney, a young dog boy wearing purple pajamas standing in the middle of a rug, is asked to &quot;go&quot; by an unseen individual because &quot;the time has come&quot; for him. The individual, who is depicted with a large arm and pointing finger and is also the narrator, tells him to &quot;go&quot;.

The narrator suggests wacky and bizarre ways for Marvin to leave (even though the narrator has no preference for the method), but all suggestions conclude with the narrator repeating the directive. After all the suggestions are listed, the individual points their finger very close at Marvin to firmly confirm that they order him to leave the room. Marvin finally complies, choosing to exit on foot. The individual waves goodbye to him.

==In political culture==
At the height of the Watergate scandal, in a July 1974 collaboration with political humorist Art Buchwald, Dr. Seuss took a two-year-old copy of his book, crossed out &quot;Marvin K. Mooney&quot; wherever it occurred and wrote in &quot;Richard M. Nixon&quot;. With Dr. Seuss&#x27;s consent, Buchwald and his editors reprinted the markup as a newspaper column, published on July 30. Nixon resigned ten days later on August 9.

In Maureen Dowd&#x27;s column for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Wilting over Waffles&quot;, dated April 23, 2008, she suggests that Democrats in the 2008 presidential election might take a cue from this book in their approach to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s prolonged campaign against Barack Obama, asking her to &quot;just go. I don&#x27;t care how&quot;. MEP Daniel Hannan quoted the book in reference to Gordon Brown after the 2009 European Parliament election.

The same idea has also been applied to Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution and Donald Trump during and after both the 2016 United States presidential election and the 2020 United States presidential election.

<text>Dictyoptera (from Greek δίκτυον &quot;diktyon&quot; &quot;net&quot; and πτερόν &quot;pteron&quot; &quot;wing&quot;) is an insect superorder that includes two extant orders of polyneopterous insects: the order Blattodea (termites and cockroaches together) and the order Mantodea (mantises). All modern Dictyoptera have short ovipositors and typically lay oothecae. The oldest fossils of Dictyoptera from the Late Carboniferous, referred to as &quot;roachoids&quot; have long ovipositors and did not lay oothecae. The oldest modern oothecae-laying dictyopterans date to the Late Triassic.

==Classification and phylogeny==
The use of the term Dictyoptera has changed over the years, and while largely out of use for much of the last century, it is becoming more widely used. It has usually been considered a superorder, with Isoptera, Blattodea and Mantodea being its three orders. In some classifications, however, Dictyoptera is shifted to order status and in others the order Isoptera has been subsumed under Blattodea while retaining Dictyoptera as a superorder. Regardless, in all classifications the constituent groups are the same, just treated at different rank. Termites and cockroaches are very closely related, with ecological and molecular data pointing to a relationship with the cockroach genus &quot;Cryptocercus&quot;.

According to genetic evidence, the closest living relatives of the Dictyoptera are the orders Phasmatodea, Mantophasmatodea, and Grylloblattodea. If the Dictyoptera are considered a superorder these other orders might be included in it.

Evolutionary relationships based on Eggleton, Beccaloni &amp; Inward 2007 and modified by Evangelista et al. 2019, are shown in the cladogram: The cockroach families Anaplectidae, Lamproblattidae, and Tryonicidae are not shown but are placed within the superfamily Blattoidea. The cockroach families Corydiidae and Ectobiidae were previously known as the Polyphagidae and Blattellidae. The cladogram also shows the family Alienopteridae (originally assigned to its own order &quot;Alienoptera&quot;) as sister to Mantodea, but it was subsequently reassigned to the extinct Blattodea superfamily Umenocoleoidea by Vršanský &quot;et al.&quot;.

<doc id="659068" wikidata="Q101395" url="?curid=659068" title="Mass number">
<text>The mass number (symbol &quot;A&quot;, from the German word: &quot;Atomgewicht&quot;, &quot;atomic weight&quot;), also called atomic mass number or nucleon number, is the total number of protons and neutrons (together known as nucleons) in an atomic nucleus. It is approximately equal to the &quot;atomic&quot; (also known as &quot;isotopic&quot;) mass of the atom expressed in atomic mass units. Since protons and neutrons are both baryons, the mass number &quot;A&quot; is identical with the baryon number &quot;B&quot; of the nucleus (and also of the whole atom or ion). The mass number is different for each isotope of a given chemical element, and the difference between the mass number and the atomic number &quot;Z&quot; gives the number of neutrons (&quot;N&quot;) in the nucleus: .

The mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element&#x27;s symbol. For example, the most common isotope of carbon is carbon-12, or , which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number (&quot;Z&quot;) as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number: .

==Mass number changes in radioactive decay==
Different types of radioactive decay are characterized by their changes in mass number as well as atomic number, according to the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy. 
For example, uranium-238 usually decays by alpha decay, where the nucleus loses two neutrons and two protons in the form of an alpha particle. Thus the atomic number and the number of neutrons each decrease by 2 (&quot;Z&quot;: 92 → 90, &quot;N&quot;: 146 → 144), so that the mass number decreases by 4 (&quot;A&quot; = 238 → 234); the result is an atom of thorium-234 and an alpha particle ():

On the other hand, carbon-14 decays by beta decay, whereby one neutron is transmuted into a proton with the emission of an electron and an antineutrino. Thus the atomic number increases by 1 (&quot;Z&quot;: 6 → 7) and the mass number remains the same (&quot;A&quot; = 14), while the number of neutrons decreases by 1 (&quot;N&quot;: 8 → 7). The resulting atom is nitrogen-14, with seven protons and seven neutrons:

Beta decay is possible because different isobars have mass differences on the order of a few electron masses. If possible, a nuclide will undergo beta decay to an adjacent isobar with lower mass. In the absence of other decay modes, a cascade of beta decays terminates at the isobar with the lowest atomic mass.

Another type of radioactive decay without change in mass number is emission of a gamma ray from a nuclear isomer or metastable excited state of an atomic nucleus. Since all the protons and neutrons remain in the nucleus unchanged in this process, the mass number is also unchanged.

==Mass number and isotopic mass==
The mass number gives an estimate of the isotopic mass measured in atomic mass units (u). For 12C, the isotopic mass is exactly 12, since the atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12 of the mass of 12C. For other isotopes, the isotopic mass is usually within 0.1 u of the mass number. For example, 35Cl (17 protons and 18 neutrons) has a mass number of 35 and an isotopic mass of 34.96885. The difference of the actual isotopic mass minus the mass number of an atom is known as the mass excess, which for 35Cl is –0.03115. Mass excess should not be confused with mass defect which is the difference between the mass of an atom and its constituent particles (namely protons, neutrons and electrons).

There are two reasons for mass 
excess:
# The neutron is slightly heavier than the proton. This increases the mass of nuclei with more neutrons than protons relative to the atomic mass unit scale based on 12C with equal numbers of protons and neutrons.
# Nuclear binding energy varies between nuclei. A nucleus with greater binding energy has a lower total energy, and therefore a lower mass according to Einstein&#x27;s mass–energy equivalence relation &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2. For 35Cl, the isotopic mass is less than 35, so this must be the dominant factor.

==Relative atomic mass of an element==

The mass number should also not be confused with the standard atomic weight (also called atomic weight) of an element, which is the ratio of the average atomic mass of the different isotopes of that element (weighted by abundance) to the atomic mass constant. The atomic weight is a &quot;mass&quot; ratio, while the mass number is a &quot;counted&quot; number (and so an integer). 

This weighted average can be quite different from the near-integer values for individual isotopic masses. For instance, there are two main isotopes of chlorine: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. In any given sample of chlorine that has not been subjected to mass separation there will be roughly 75% of chlorine atoms which are chlorine-35 and only 25% of chlorine atoms which are chlorine-37. This gives chlorine a relative atomic mass of 35.5 (actually 35.4527 g/mol).

Moreover, the weighted average mass can be near-integer, but at the same time not corresponding to the mass of any natural isotope. For example, bromine has only two stable isotopes, 79Br and 81Br, naturally present in approximately equal fractions, which leads to the standard atomic mass of bromine close to 80 (79.904 g/mol), even though the isotope 80Br with such mass is unstable.

<text>Guardamar del Segura (), or briefly Guardamar, is a municipality of the province of Alicante located at the mouth of the river Segura in southern Valencia (autonomous community), Spain. It is a Mediterranean resort, with a large pine forest abutting an 11-km-long white sand beach.

Historically, it was an area of fishermen and farmers. A Phoenician colony, called &quot;Herna&quot; by Roman geographer Avienius in his book &quot;Ora Maritima&quot; was the first settlement near the mouth of Segura river, In Valencian, &quot;guardar&quot; means safekeeping and &quot;mar&quot; means sea, and this is another possible basis for its current name.

Guardamar is the southernmost Valencian-speaking town and in 1991 41.8% of the town&#x27;s residents could speak it. Guardamar is also the only municipality of the Vega Baja del Segura comarca (known locally as Baix Segura) where Valencian is traditionally and widely spoken.

Guardamar hosts local festivals like &quot;Moros i Cristians&quot; (Moros y Cristianos), &quot;L&#x27;Encantà&quot;, and &quot;Fogueres de Sant Joan&quot; (Hogueras de San Juan), which commemorate its history.

==Population==
The INE (Spanish Census) of 2006 showed that the city had 14,261 residents. By January 2011 this figure had reached 16,863 of which 10,051 were Spanish. The total dropped by 2015 to 15,589. The most prominent nationalities in 2015 were:


==Government==
Carmen Verdú is the mayor of the city. In the latest municipal elections of May 2011, Carmen Verdú of the People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Partido Popular&quot;) won the elections with an absolute majority, larger than the one the former mayor (María Elena Albentosa) had, while the opposition (Socialist Party) lost some of their popular support. She is the second woman ever to occupy this position.

At the 2015 local elections, the political composition on the local council was:

<text>Viscount Goderich was a title that was created twice in British history. The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1706 in favour of Henry Grey, 12th Earl of Kent. He was made Marquess of Kent at the same time and was further honoured when he was made Duke of Kent in 1710. All the titles became extinct on his death in 1740. For further information on this creation, see Duke of Kent (1710 creation). The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1827 in favour of the Honourable F. J. Robinson. He was a great-great-grandson of the first Duke of Kent. In 1833 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Ripon. For further history of this creation, see Marquess of Ripon.

The title is taken from Goodrich Castle in Herefordshire, owned by the Earls of Kent.

<doc id="659073" wikidata="Q658178" url="?curid=659073" title="Contrast (literary)">
<text>In literature, an author uses contrast when they describe the difference(s) between two or more entities. According to the Oxford Dictionary, contrast is comparing two things in order to show the differences between them. It is common in many works of Literature. For example, in The Pearl by John Steinbeck, a clear contrast is drawn between the Lower Class and the Upper Class residents of the society presented in the text. The Lower Class citizens live in brush houses, their economic activity is fishing and are sociable. These ones are represented by Kino, the main character and the fishermen. On the other hand, the Upper Class citizens live in plastered buildings, they engage in reputable economic activities such as medicine and are more focused to their economic activities as opposed to social interactions. 

In addition, in the first four lines of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Sonnet 130&quot;, Shakespeare contrasts a mistress to the sun, coral, snow, and wire.

Contrast is the antonym of simile. In poetic compositions, it is common for poets to set out an elaborate contrast or elaborate simile as the argument. For example, John Donne and the metaphysical poets developed the conceit as a literary device, where an elaborate, implausible, and surprising analogy was demonstrated. In Renaissance poetry, and particularly in sonnets, the contrast was similarly used as a poetic argument. In such verse, the entire poem argues that two seemingly alike or identical items are, in fact, quite separate and paradoxically different. These may take the form of &quot;my love is unlike all other women&quot; or &quot;I am unlike her other loves&quot;.

In the early 18th century, a theory of wit developed by English writers (particularly John Locke) held that judgement sees the differences in like things, or imagination or fancy sees the likeness in different things, and wit operates properly by employing judgement and fancy to form sound propositions. In lyric poetry, the author is often attempting to show how what seems to be solely an exercise of judgement or fancy is, in fact, wit.

<text>Dexter Scott King (January 30, 1961 – January 22, 2024) was an American civil rights activist, animal rights activist, and an author. The second son of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, he was also the brother of Martin Luther King III, Bernice King, and Yolanda King; and also grandson of Martin Luther King Sr. and Alberta Williams King. He is the author of &quot;Growing Up King: An Intimate Memoir&quot;.

==Early life==

Dexter Scott King was born on January 30, 1961, at Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta – Hughes Spalding Children&#x27;s Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, to Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. and named after the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where his father was pastor before moving to the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. His eldest sister Yolanda watched after him. 

King was seven years old when his father was assassinated in 1968. He was watching television with his older brother, Martin III, when they saw a news flash about the shooting. King and his siblings were assured an education thanks to the help of Harry Belafonte, who set up a trust fund for them years prior to their father&#x27;s assassination. King attended the Democratic National Convention in 1972, which led him to gain an interest in politics.

King attended his father&#x27;s alma mater of Morehouse College, where he studied business administration from 1979 to 1984. He left Morehouse before graduating.

==Work==

King split his time between Atlanta, Georgia, where he served as chairman of the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, and Malibu, California.

In May 1989, King&#x27;s mother named the twenty-eight-year-old as her successor as president of the King Center. Before his mother&#x27;s choice, King openly expressed interest in changing the King Center into &quot;a West Point of nonviolent training&quot;. Dexter Scott King served as president of the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, but resigned only four months after taking the office after a dispute with his mother. He resumed the position in 1994, but the King Center&#x27;s influence was sharply reduced by then. As President, he cut the number of staff from 70 to 14 and shut down a child care center among a shift from conventional activities to prioritizing preserving his father&#x27;s legacy. Reflecting, King admitted that the time was not right since he was &quot;probably moving faster than the board was ready to&quot;.

Dexter was a dedicated vegan and animal rights activist, having been introduced to vegetarianism in the late 1980s by Dick Gregory.

On August 24, 2013, King attended the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, the event at which his father delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.

===Film===
Dexter Scott King voiced his father&#x27;s 34-year-old self in the 1999 educational film, &quot;Our Friend, Martin&quot;. The film was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program.

Dexter Scott King also portrayed Martin Luther King Jr. in the 2002 American television movie &quot;The Rosa Parks Story&quot;.

==Loyd Jowers trial==

In 1997, 29 years after Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s death, Dexter met with James Earl Ray, the man imprisoned for his father&#x27;s 1968 murder. When confronting him, King asked Ray, &quot;I just want to ask you, for the record, um, did you kill my father?&quot; Ray replied, &quot;No-no I didn&#x27;t.&quot; King then told Ray that he along with the rest of the King family believed him. King and Ray had then discussed the latter&#x27;s health and the actions of J. Edgar Hoover. King also told him that his family believed in his testament of innocence and were seeking to help him. The two spoke privately after 25 minutes with reporters, and King asserted to reporters that he did not know who killed his father and that this uncertainty was the cause of their request for a new trial. As he asserted that he did not believe Ray had any role in his father&#x27;s death, he brought up evidence taken from the scene such as the murder weapon and concluded that Ray would not have disposed of it near the scene of the crime, calling his belief as having been in his &quot;gut&quot;.

At a 1999 press conference, Dexter was subsequently asked by a reporter, &quot;there are many people out there who feel that as long as these conspirators remain nameless and faceless there is no true closure, and no justice&quot;. He replied:

No, he [Loyd Jowers] named the shooter. The shooter was the Memphis Police Department Officer, Lt. Earl Clark who he named as the killer. Once again, beyond that you had credible witnesses that named members of a Special Forces team who didn&#x27;t have to act because the contract killer succeeded, with plausible denial, a Mafia contracted killer.

His belief towards a conspiracy extended to President Lyndon B. Johnson. He believed that with the evidence he was shown, there would be difficulty &quot;for something of that magnitude to occur on his watch and he not be privy to it&quot;. King pursued Andrew Young to get him involved, and Young changed his position on the assassination of his father after being visited by Dexter in the spring of 1997. His position had always been &quot;that it didn&#x27;t matter who killed Dr. King but what killed him&quot;.

==Personal life==
In July 2013, Dexter married Leah Weber in a private ceremony in California.

===Family===

King&#x27;s mother, Coretta Scott King, died on January 30, 2006, at age 78 on his 45th birthday. 

Dexter&#x27;s elder sister, Yolanda, collapsed at the home of his best friend, Philip Madison Jones, on May 15, 2007. King called his aunt Christine King Farris and reported that he had tried to save her, but was not successful and was transporting her to the hospital. She could not be revived and died at age 51. Her family believes she had a heart condition. Dexter spoke to her just an hour before her death, and did not think much of it when she told him she was tired due to her &quot;hectic&quot; schedule. In regards to his sister&#x27;s death and the role she had played in his life, King statedShe gave me permission. She allowed me to give myself permission to be me. 

Dexter charged &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; with &quot;viciously attacking&quot; his family after the newspaper printed a claim by a German television program that his sister Bernice wanted $4,000 or $5,000 for a ten-minute interview, which King denied.

===Lawsuits===
On July 11, 2008, Dexter King was sued by his sister Bernice King and brother Martin Luther King III; in addition, he was sued by Bernice King on behalf of the estate of Coretta King. The lawsuit alleged that Dexter improperly took funds from their parents&#x27; estate. Dexter filed countersuits against his siblings over their use of the King Center and over the ownership of their mother&#x27;s personal papers, which he wanted to share with a biographer for a deal with Penguin Books.

These lawsuits were filed in Fulton County, Georgia Superior Court and were settled out of court in October 2009. In 2010, the three supported that year&#x27;s census, seemingly indicating they had reaffirmed their relationships since the dispute. In 2016, the siblings&#x27; remaining legal dispute, over the ownership of King&#x27;s 1964 Nobel Peace Prize medal, was settled out of court. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter served as one of the mediators.

==Death==
Dexter King died of prostate cancer at home in Malibu, California, on January 22, 2024, 8 days before his 63rd birthday.

<text>Moutier () is a municipality in Switzerland. Currently, the town belongs to the Jura bernois administrative district of the canton of Bern. On 28 March 2021, the population voted to secede from the canton of Bern and join the Canton of Jura; the decision however is not immediately operative and entails a lengthy process of transfer of competences between cantonal authorities. It is currently the largest town in Jura bernois.

==History==
Moutier is first mentioned in 1154 in the phrase &quot;datum Monasterii&quot;. In 1181, it was mentioned as &quot;apud Monasterium&quot; (&#x27;at the Abbey&#x27;). The German name for the town is &quot;Münster (BE)&quot;, but it is not frequently used.

The area was lightly settled even before the founding of Moutier-Grandval Abbey around 640. Much of the early history of the village is closely connected with the Abbey. Between 1049 and 1150, the Abbey was granted a stift or land donation to support the college of canons. The stift allowed the Abbey to grow into a major landholder and a regional power. The village church of Saint-Pierre, which eventually became a parish church, was probably built during the Early Middle Ages. In the 12th century, another monastery was founded in Moutier, but it was destroyed in a fire in 1269. In addition to the Church of Saint-Pierre, the collegiate church of Saint-Germain and Saint-Randoald was built in Moutier during the 12th century. Everything changed in Moutier after the Protestant Reformation was accepted by Bern in 1531. The Abbey closed and the college of canons relocated to Delémont. The church of Saint-Germain and Saint-Randoald was closed while the church of Saint-Pierre converted to the new faith and was expanded. A fire destroyed the church of Saint-Germain and Saint-Randoald in 1571 though in 1860–63 a Reformed church was built on the site. The church of Saint-Pierre was demolished in 1873. Today Moutier has both German and French speaking churches.

After the college of canons of the Abbey moved to Delémont, the Abbey&#x27;s properties in and around Moutier fell under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. The Bishop appointed a provost to manage the Abbey&#x27;s estates and around the end of the 16th century, built the Provost&#x27;s Castle. The provost remained in Moutier until 1797. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Moutier became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800, it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Moutier was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Two years later, in 1817, the Canton of Bern acquired the castle and used it as the seat of the district governor.

During the 19th century and early 20th century, Moutier developed into a transportation hub. In 1876, a railway opened between Basel and Moutier. This first railroad was followed by a route to Biel through the Tavannes valley in 1877 and then to Solothurn in 1908. In 1915, the long Grenchenberg tunnel connected Moutier and Grenchen. The extensive road and railroad network encouraged Moutier to industrialize, with three industries, glass-making, watchmaking, and automatic lathes, gaining international recognition for Moutier.

In 1842, Célestin Châtelain founded the Verrerie de Moutier glass factory. They became the most important window glass manufacturer in Switzerland and by the 1970s produced 250 tons of glass per month to meet Swiss domestic demand. The conversion from glass rolling to float glass spelled the end of the old Moutier glass factory, it closed in 1978. However, a subsidiary, Verres Industriels SA, had been created in 1955 and they began producing glass with the new process. Today, Verres Industriels employs about 200 people.

Watchmaking first spread throughout the Jura region as a cottage industry during the 19th century. In the late 19th century, the Grande Fabrique was built in Moutier and by 1880 employed about 500 workers. A number of watchmakers opened factories in the town, of which Léon Lévy &amp; Frères and Louis Schwab were some of the largest. However, many of Moutier&#x27;s independent watchmakers went bankrupt and were forced to close during the Great Depression. Those that survived this period were generally absorbed by ETA SA in the 1950s.

In 1883, Nicolas Junker founded the Junker &amp; Cie company to manufacture automatic lathes with a moveable headstock. After a bankruptcy and several name changes the company became Usines Tornos, Fabrique de machines Moutier SA in 1918. In 1968, Tornos bought the Pétermann SA company to become Tornos Pétermann. They then merged in 1974 with Bechler SA to become Moutier Machines Holding, which became Tornos-Bechler SA in 1981. It was renamed to Tornos SA in 2001. Over its nearly a century in operation, Usines Tornos built workers&#x27; housing, provided jobs and vocational training and helped drive Moutier&#x27;s growth. At its peak in 1974, the company employed about 3,000 people. Between 1980 and 2000, the company acquired and sold off several companies and reduced its headcount to about 1300 in 2001. In 2010, the company employed 855 people, including 655 in Moutier.

In 1950, Moutier became a city and a number of construction projects followed. A swimming pool opened in that same year. In 1955 a second primary school opened along with a new building for the secondary school. A new train station opened in 1961. In 1962 the old secondary school was converted into a town hall. A primary school in Chantemerle opened in 1973 and a new district hospital was built in 1976. There are two museums in town, the villa Bechler with the Jurassic Museum of Arts and the villa Junker with the Museum of Automatic Lathes.

Politically, the issue of Jura separatism is a major issue in Moutier. In 1974, a plebiscite voted to remain part of Bern by a margin of only 70 votes. This led to acts of vandalism on 16 March 1974 and on 7 September 1975 an armed standoff at the Hôtel de la Gare which was broken up by an elite team of Bernese police on the following day. Two other plebiscites also came down on the side of remaining in the Canton of Bern, including one in 1998 which passed with a thin majority of 41 votes. In 2013, a third plebiscite ended with the majority of residents choosing to remain in Bern, though a majority of residents of Moutier wanted to join Jura. On 18 June 2017, the municipality held a referendum, asking citizens &#x27;Do you want the city of Moutier to belong to the Republic and Canton of Jura?&#x27; The result of the referendum was 51.7% of the citizenry voting in favour of Moutier joining the Canton of Jura. The vote has since been declared invalid.

On 28 March 2021, a repeated referendum saw 54.9% of Moutier voters once again vote in favour of seceding from Bern to join Jura. The process was declared valid, and as such, the transfer process began and is expected to take around 5 years. A fourth district for Moutier will be created in the Canton of Jura once the transfer is complete.

<doc id="659086" wikidata="Q1121344" url="?curid=659086" title="Solutrean">
<text>The Solutrean industry is a relatively advanced flint tool-making style of the Upper Paleolithic of the Final Gravettian, from around 22,000 to 17,000 BP. Solutrean sites have been found in modern-day France, Spain and Portugal.

== Details ==
The term &quot;Solutrean&quot; comes from the type-site of &quot;Cros du Charnier&quot;, dating to around 21,000 years ago and located at Solutré, in east-central France near Mâcon. The Rock of Solutré site was discovered in 1866 by the French geologist and paleontologist Henry Testot-Ferry. It is now preserved as the Parc archéologique et botanique de Solutré.

The industry was named by Gabriel de Mortillet to describe the second stage of his system of cave chronology, following the Mousterian, and he considered it synchronous with the third division of the Quaternary period. The era&#x27;s finds include tools, ornamental beads, and bone pins as well as prehistoric art.

Solutrean tool-making employed techniques not seen before and not rediscovered for millennia. The Solutrean has relatively finely worked, bifacial points made with lithic reduction percussion and pressure flaking rather than flintknapping. Knapping was done using antler batons, hardwood batons and soft stone hammers. This method permitted the working of delicate slivers of flint to make light projectiles and even elaborate barbed and tanged arrowheads. Large thin spearheads; scrapers with edge not on the side but on the end; flint knives and saws, but all still chipped, not ground or polished; long spear-points, with tang and shoulder on one side only, are also characteristic implements of this industry. Bone and antler were used as well.

The Solutrean may be seen as a transitional stage between the flint implements of the Mousterian and the bone implements of the Magdalenian epochs. Faunal finds include horses, reindeer, ibex, mammoths, cave lions, rhinoceroses, bears and aurochs. Solutrean finds have also been made in the caves of Les Eyzies and , and in the Lower Beds of Creswell Crags in Derbyshire, England (Proto-Solutrean). The industry first appeared in what is now Spain, and disappears from the archaeological record around 17,000 BP.

== Physical characteristics ==
Examination of physical remains from the Solutrean period has determined that they were of a slightly more gracile type than the preceding Gravettian culture. Males were rather tall, with some skeletons being up to 179 cm tall. Volume 4 of the &quot;Portuguese Magazine of Archaeology&quot; from 2001 examined a Solutrean female individual whose physical remains are described as &quot;having postcranial elements that derive from a relatively small and gracile individual&quot;. The teeth of Solutrean individuals are described as being similar in appearance to those belonging to the people of the Gravettian.

== Genetics ==
Analysis of genomics of Solutrean-related individuals has found that they are unrelated to ancient or modern Native Americans and are instead related to earlier Western European Cro-Magnons, particularly earlier Gravettian-producing individuals from France and Spain, as well to the producers of the subsequent Magdalenian culture. It has been found that Solutreans are also closely related to Aurignacians.

== Solutrean hypothesis in North American archaeology ==

The Solutrean hypothesis argues that people from Europe may have been among the earliest settlers of the Americas. Its notable recent proponents include Dennis Stanford of the Smithsonian Institution and Bruce Bradley of the University of Exeter. This hypothesis contrasts with the mainstream archaeological consensus that the North American continent was first populated by people from Asia, either by the Bering land bridge (i.e. Beringia) at least 13,500 years ago, or by maritime travel along the Pacific coast, or by both. The idea of a Clovis-Solutrean link remains controversial and does not enjoy wide acceptance. The hypothesis is challenged by large gaps in time between the Clovis culture and Solutrean eras, a lack of evidence of Solutrean seafaring, lack of specific Solutrean features and tools in Clovis technology, the difficulties of the route, and other issues.

In 2014, the autosomal DNA of a male infant (Anzick-1) from a 12,500-year-old deposit in Montana was sequenced. The skeleton was found in close association with several Clovis artifacts. Comparisons showed strong affinities with DNA from Siberian sites, and virtually ruled out any close affinity of Anzick-1 with European sources. The DNA of the Anzick-1 sample showed strong affinities with sampled Native American populations, which indicated that the samples derive from an ancient population that lived in or near Siberia, the Upper Paleolithic Mal&#x27;ta population.

<text>In the United States, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, is a federal government program that provides food-purchasing assistance for low- and no-income persons to help them maintain adequate nutrition and health. It is a federal aid program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), though benefits are distributed by specific departments of U.S. states (e.g., the Division of Social Services, the Department of Health and Human Services, etc.).

SNAP benefits supplied roughly 40 million Americans in 2018, at an expenditure of $57.1 billion. Approximately 9.2% of American households obtained SNAP benefits at some point during 2017, with approximately 16.7% of all children living in households with SNAP benefits. Beneficiaries and costs increased sharply with the Great Recession, peaked in 2013 and declined through 2017 as the economy recovered. It is the largest nutrition program of the 15 administered by FNS and is a key component of the social safety net for low-income Americans.

The amount of SNAP benefits received by a household depends on the household&#x27;s size, income, and expenses. For most of its history, the program used paper-denominated &quot;stamps&quot; or coupons—worth $1 (brown), $5 (blue), and $10 (green)—bound into booklets of various denominations, to be torn out individually and used in single-use exchange. Because of their 1:1 value ratio with actual currency, the coupons were printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Their rectangular shape resembled a U.S. dollar bill (although about one-half the size), including intaglio printing on high-quality paper with watermarks. In the late 1990s, the Food Stamp Program was revamped, with some states phasing out actual stamps in favor of a specialized debit card system known as Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT), provided by private contractors. EBT has been implemented in all states since June 2004. Each month, SNAP benefits are directly deposited into the household&#x27;s EBT card account. Households may use EBT to pay for food at supermarkets, convenience stores, and other food retailers, including certain farmers&#x27; markets.

==History==

=== Origin of food stamps ===
The federal government&#x27;s ability to alleviate hunger through the means of food stamps was first introduced with Congress passing the income tax law. Even after the federal government had the funding to create a social safety net, its involvement in food assistance was not introduced until the 1930s, when the Great Depression caused unemployment, homelessness, and starvation to become a national issue that permeated such a high percentage of the population. At the time of the Great Depression, farmers were growing surplus produce, but unemployed and impoverished people were unable to afford to buy it. The origin of food stamps were intended partially to help the poor, but just as equally to boost the economy and pay farmers a fair price for their labors. In essence, food stamps were intended to create a political agreement between agriculture and the federal government by giving out excess goods in a crisis.

=== First Food Stamp Program (FSP; May 16, 1939 – Spring 1943) ===
The idea for the first food stamp program has been credited to various people, most notably Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace and the program&#x27;s first administrator, Milo Perkins. Of the program, Perkins said, &quot;We got a picture of a gorge, with farm surpluses on one cliff and under-nourished city folks with outstretched hands on the other. We set out to find a practical way to build a bridge across that chasm.&quot; The program, run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) by permitting people on relief to buy orange stamps equal to their normal food expenditures; for every dollar of orange stamps purchased, fifty cents worth of blue stamps were received. Orange food stamps could be used at any food retailers or wholesalers, but excluded alcoholic beverages, concession stand meals that could be eaten on premises, and tobacco products. The blue stamps could only be used to buy what the USDA defined as surplus produce, which included items such as beans, eggs, fruit, and the like.

Over the course of nearly four years, the first FSP reached approximately 20 million people in nearly half of the counties in the United States at a total cost of $262 million. At its peak, the program assisted an estimated four million people. The first recipient was Mabel McFiggin of Rochester, New York; the first retailer to redeem the stamps was Joseph Mutolo; and the first retailer caught violating program rules was Nick Salzano in October 1939. The program ended when the conditions that brought the program into being—unmarketable food surpluses and widespread unemployment—ceased to exist. By 1943, the start of World War II equalized the agricultural economy and the unemployment rate was lowered, and incentive to help those still in need was not reason enough for the government to continue this program.

===Pilot Food Stamp Program (1961–1964)===
The 18 years between the end of the first FSP and the inception of the next were filled with studies, reports, and legislative proposals. Prominent US senators actively associated with attempts to enact a food stamp program during this period included George Aiken, Robert M. La Follette Jr., Hubert Humphrey, Estes Kefauver, and Stuart Symington. From 1954 on, US Representative Leonor Sullivan strove to pass food-stamp program legislation.

Hunger continued for the poor people of the country even after the Great Depression ended, but advocacy to reinstate the food stamp program was generally unsuccessful while the political agenda did not require it. Until 1961 when President John F. Kennedy took office, there were few pilot programs in place to help America&#x27;s poor.

On September 21, 1959, P.L. 86-341 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to operate a food-stamp system through January 31, 1962. The Eisenhower Administration never used the authority. However, in fulfillment of a campaign promise made in West Virginia, President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s first Executive Order called for expanded food distribution and, on February 2, 1961, he announced that food stamp pilot programs would be initiated. The pilot programs would retain the requirement that the food stamps be purchased, but eliminated the concept of special stamps for surplus foods. A Department spokesman indicated the emphasis would be on increasing the consumption of perishables. This decision still provided great advantages for retailers, and the political choice to eliminate the required purchase of surplus produce created financial gains for the producers and distributors of processed foods.

This move, however, was heavily resisted by representatives of the Civil Rights Movement. Black sharecroppers, already pushed out of agricultural work due to mechanization, lost their source of income to purchase food stamps. While White-based grocers grew profits as a result of food stamps, plantation owners utilized food stamps as leverage against former Black sharecroppers. This leverage looked like taking food stamp costs out of a sharecropper&#x27;s income, permitting food stamps for only select grocers, permitting stamps for only the most expensive products, and similar maneuvers. These mechanisms consolidated White power over sharecroppers, and the move to food stamps was criticized by many Black activists.

Of the program, US Representative Leonor K. Sullivan of Missouri asserted, &quot;...the Department of Agriculture seemed bent on outlining a possible food stamp plan of such scope and magnitude, involving some 25 million persons, as to make the whole idea seem ridiculous and tear food stamp plans to smithereens.&quot;

===Food Stamp Act of 1964===
President Johnson called for a permanent food-stamp program on January 31, 1964, as part of his &quot;War on Poverty&quot; platform introduced at the State of the Union a few weeks earlier. Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman submitted the legislation on April 17, 1964. The bill eventually passed by Congress was H.R. 10222, introduced by Congresswoman Sullivan. One of the members on the House Committee on Agriculture who voted against the FSP in Committee was then Representative Bob Dole, of Kansas. (Later, as a senator, after he worked on the 1977 legislation that addressed problems with the program, Dole became a staunch supporter of it.)

The Food Stamp Act of 1964 was intended to strengthen the agricultural economy and provide improved levels of nutrition among low-income households; however, the practical purpose was to bring the pilot FSP under congressional control and to enact the regulations into law.

The major provisions were:
* The State Plan of Operation requirement and development of eligibility standards by States;
* They required that the recipients should purchase their food stamps, while paying the average money spent on food then receiving an amount of food stamps representing an opportunity more nearly to obtain a low-cost nutritionally adequate diet;
* The eligibility for purchase with food stamps of all items intended for human consumption except alcoholic beverages and imported foods (the House version would have prohibited the purchase of soft drinks, luxury foods, and luxury frozen foods);
* Prohibitions against discrimination on basis of race, religious creed, national origin, or political beliefs;
* The division of responsibilities between States (certification and issuance) and the Federal Government (funding of benefits and authorization of retailers and wholesalers), with shared responsibility for funding costs of administration; and
* Appropriations for the first year limited to $75 million; for the second year, to $100 million; and, for the third year, to $200 million.

The Agriculture Department estimated that participation in a national FSP would eventually reach 4 million, at a cost of $360 million annually, far below the actual numbers.

===Program expansion: participation milestones in the 1960s and early 1970s===
In April 1965, participation topped half a million. (Actual participation was 561,261 people.) Participation topped 1 million in March 1966, 2 million in October 1967, 3 million in February 1969, 4 million in February 1970, 5 million one month later in March 1970, 6 million two months later in May 1970, 10 million in February 1971, and 15 million in October 1974. Rapid increases in participation during this period were primarily due to geographic expansion.

===Major legislative changes (early 1970s)===
The early 1970s were a period of growth in participation, concern about the cost of providing food stamp benefits, and questions about administration, primarily timely certification. During this time, the issue was framed that would dominate food stamp legislation ever after: how to balance program access with program accountability. Three major pieces of legislation shaped this period, leading up to massive reform to follow:

P.L. 91-671 (January 11, 1971) established uniform national standards of eligibility and work requirements; required that allotments be equivalent to the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet; limited households&#x27; purchase requirements to 30 percent of their income; instituted an outreach requirement; authorized the Agriculture Department to pay 62.5 percent of specific administrative costs incurred by States; expanded the FSP to Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States; and provided $1.75 billion appropriations for Fiscal Year 1971.

Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (P.L. 93–86, August 10, 1973) required States to expand the program to every political jurisdiction before July 1, 1974; expanded the program to drug addicts and alcoholics in treatment and rehabilitation centers; established semi-annual allotment adjustments, bi-monthly issuance, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) &quot;cash-out&quot; (which gave the option to states to issue Food Stamp benefits to SSI recipients in the form of their estimated cash value consolidated within the SSI grant, in order to reduce administrative costs); introduced statutory complexity in the income definition (by including in-kind payments and providing an accompanying exception); and required the department to establish temporary eligibility standards for disasters.

P.L. 93-347 (July 12, 1974) authorized the department to pay 50 percent of all states&#x27; costs for administering the program and established the requirement for efficient and effective administration by the States.

===1974 nationwide program===
In accordance with P.L. 93–86, the FSP began operating nationwide on July 1, 1974. (The program was not fully implemented in Puerto Rico until November 1, 1974.) Participation for July 1974 was almost 14 million.

===Eligible access to Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries===
Once a person is a beneficiary of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Program they may be automatically eligible for Food Stamps depending on their state&#x27;s laws. How much money in food stamps they receive also varies by state. Supplemental Security Income was created in 1974.

===Food Stamp Act of 1977===
Both the outgoing Republican administration and the new Democratic administration offered Congress proposed legislation to reform the FSP in 1977. The Republican bill stressed targeting benefits to the neediest, simplifying administration, and tightening controls on the program; the Democratic bill focused on increasing access to those most in need and simplifying and streamlining a complicated and cumbersome process that delayed benefit delivery as well as reducing errors, and curbing abuse. The chief force for the Democratic administration was Robert Greenstein, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS).

In Congress, major players were Senators George McGovern, Jacob Javits, Hubert Humphrey, and Bob Dole, and Congressmen Foley and Richmond. Amid all the themes, the one that became the rallying cry for FSP reform was &quot;EPR&quot;—eliminate the purchase requirement—because of the barrier to participation the purchase requirement represented. The bill that became the law (S. 275) did eliminate the purchase requirement. It also:
* eliminated categorical eligibility;
* established statutory income eligibility guidelines at the poverty line;
* established 10 categories of excluded income;
* reduced the number of deductions used to calculate net income and established a standard deduction to take the place of eliminated deductions;
* raised the general resource limit to $1,750;
* established the fair market value (FMV) test for evaluating vehicles as resources;
* penalized households whose heads voluntarily quit jobs;
* restricted eligibility for students and aliens;
* eliminated the requirement that households must have cooking facilities;
* replaced store due bills with cash change up to 99 cents;
* established the principle that stores must sell a substantial amount of staple foods if they are to be authorized;
* established the ground rules for Indian Tribal Organization administration of the FSP on reservations; and
* introduced demonstration project authority.

In addition to EPR, the Food Stamp Act of 1977 included several access provisions:
* using mail, telephone, or home visits for certification;
* requirements for outreach, bilingual personnel and materials, and nutrition education materials;
* recipients&#x27; right to submit applications the first day they attempt to do so;
* 30-day processing standard and inception of the concept of expedited service;
* Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the major cash welfare program; also assist SSI clients
* notice, recertification, and retroactive benefit protections; and
* a requirement for States to develop a disaster plan.

The integrity provisions of the new program included fraud disqualifications, enhanced federal funding for states&#x27; anti-fraud activities, and financial incentives for low error rates.

Senator Dole, Republican of Kansas, who had worked with Senator McGovern, Democrat of South Dakota, to produce a bipartisan solution to the two of the main problems associated with food stamps—cumbersome purchase requirements and lax eligibility standards—told Congress regarding the new provisions: &quot;I am confident that this bill eliminates the greedy and feeds the needy.&quot;

The House Report for the 1977 legislation points out that the changes in the Food Stamp Program are needed without reference to upcoming welfare reform since &quot;the path to welfare reform is, indeed, rocky...&quot;

EPR was implemented January 1, 1979. Participation that month increased 1.5 million over the preceding month. Increased participation was due to both eliminating the purchase requirement and the 1980 recession.

According to Maggie Dickinson in the book &quot;Feeding the Crisis of Care and Abandonment in America&#x27;s Food Safety Net&quot; &quot;The Food Stamp Act of 1977 finally eliminated the food stamp purchase requirement, which mean poor families no longer needed to have cash up front to purchase food stamps.&quot;

===Cutbacks of the early 1980s===
The large and expensive FSP proved to be a favorite subject of close scrutiny from both the Executive Branch and Congress in the early 1980s. Major legislation in 1981 and 1982 enacted cutbacks including:
* addition of a gross income eligibility test in addition to the net income test for most households;
* temporary freeze on adjustments of the shelter deduction cap and the standard deduction and constraints on future adjustments;
* annual adjustments in food stamp allotments rather than semi-annual;
* consideration of non-elderly parents who live with their children and non-elderly siblings who live together as one household;
* required periodic reporting and retrospective budgeting;
* prohibition against using Federal funds for outreach;
* replacing the FSP in Puerto Rico with a block grant for nutrition assistance;
* counting retirement accounts as resources;
* state option to require job search of applicants as well as participants; and
* increased disqualification periods for voluntary quitters.

The first electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card pilot program began in Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1984.

===Mid-to-late 1980s===
Recognition of the severe domestic hunger problem in the latter half of the 1980s led to incremental expansions of the FSP in 1985 and 1987, such as elimination of sales tax on food stamp purchases, reinstitution of categorical eligibility, increased resource limit for most households ($2,000), eligibility for the homeless, and expanded nutrition education. The Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 and the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act in 1990 foretold the improvements that would be coming. The 1988 and 1990 legislation accomplished the following:
* increasing benefits by applying a multiplication factor to Thrifty Food Plan costs;
* making outreach an optional activity for States;
* excluding advance earned income tax credits as income;
* simplifying procedures for calculating medical deductions;
* instituting periodic adjustments of the minimum benefit;
* authorizing nutrition education grants;
* establishing severe penalties for violations by individuals or participating firms; and
* establishing EBT as an issuance alternative.

Throughout this era, significant players were principally various committee chairmen: Congressmen Leland, Hall, Foley, Leon Panetta, and, de la Garza and Senator Patrick Leahy.

===1993 Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act===
By 1993, major changes in food stamp benefits had arrived. The final legislation provided for $2.8 billion in benefit increases over Fiscal Years 1984–1988. Leon Panetta, in his new role as OMB Director, played a major role as did Senator Leahy. Substantive changes included:
* eliminating the shelter deduction cap beginning January 1, 1997;
* providing a deduction for legally binding child support payments made to nonhousehold members;
* raising the cap on the dependent care deduction from $160 to $200 for children under 2 years old and $175 for all other dependents;
* improving employment and training (E&amp;T) dependent care reimbursements;
* increasing the FMV test for vehicles to $4,550 on September 1, 1994, and $4,600 on October 1, 1995, then annually adjusting the value from $5,000 on October 1, 1996;
* mandating asset accumulation demonstration projects; and
* simplifying the household definition.

===Later participation milestones===
In December 1979, participation surpassed 20 million. In March 1994, participation hit a new high of 28 million.

===1996 welfare reform and subsequent amendments===
The mid-1990s was a period of welfare reform. Prior to 1996, the rules for the cash welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), were waived for many states. With the enactment of the 1996 welfare reform act, called the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), AFDC, an entitlement program, was replaced with a new block grant to states called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).

Although the Food Stamp Program was reauthorized in the 1996 Farm Bill, the 1996 welfare reform made several changes to the program, including:
* denying eligibility for food stamps to most legal immigrants who had been in the country less than five years;
* placing a time limit on food stamp receipt of three out of 36 months for Able-bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) who are not working at least 20 hours a week or participating in a work program;
* reducing the maximum allotments to 100 percent of the change in the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) from 103 percent of the change in the TFP;
* freezing the standard deduction, the vehicle limit, and the minimum benefit;
* setting the shelter cap at graduated specified levels up to $300 by fiscal year 2001, and allowing states to mandate the use of the standard utility allowance;
* revising provisions for disqualification, including comparable disqualification with other means-tested programs; and
* requiring states to implement EBT before October 1, 2002.

As a result of all these changes, participation rates plummeted in the late 1990s, according to the online magazine &quot;Slate&quot;.

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Act of 1998 (AREERA) made some changes to these provisions, most significantly:
* using additional Employment and Training (E&amp;T) funds to providing work program opportunities for able-bodied adults without dependents;
* allowing states to exempt up to 15 percent of able-bodied adults without dependents who would otherwise be ineligible;
* restoring eligibility for certain elderly, disabled, and minor immigrants who resided in the United States when the 1996 welfare reform act was enacted; and
* cutting administrative funding for states to account for certain administrative costs that previously had been allocated to the AFDC program and now were required to be allocated to the Food Stamp Program.

The fiscal year 2001 agriculture appropriations bill included two significant changes. The legislation increased the excess shelter cap to $340 in fiscal year 2001 and then indexed the cap to changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Consumers each year beginning in fiscal year 2002. The legislation also allowed states to use the vehicle limit they use in a TANF assistance program, if it would be result in a lower attribution of resources for the household.

===Electronic benefit transfer===
In the late 1990s, the Food Stamp Program was revamped, with some states phasing out actual stamps in favor of a specialized debit card system known as Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT), provided by private contractors. Many states merged the use of the EBT card for public welfare programs as well, such as cash assistance. The move was designed to save the government money by not printing the coupons, make benefits available immediately instead of requiring the recipient to wait for mailing or picking up the booklets in person, and reduce theft and diversion.

===Renaming the Food Stamp Program===
The 2008 farm bill renamed the Food Stamp Program to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (beginning October 2008) and replaced all references to &quot;stamp&quot; or &quot;coupon&quot; in federal law with &quot;card&quot; or &quot;EBT&quot;. This was done to mark a more explicit focus on providing nutrition. It was also done to reduce usage of the stigmatized phrase &quot;food stamps&quot;.

===Temporary benefits increase from April 2009 to November 2013===
SNAP benefits temporarily increased with the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), a federal stimulus package to help Americans affected by the Great Recession of 2007. Beginning in April 2009 and continuing through the expansion&#x27;s expiration on November 1, 2013, the ARRA appropriated $45.2 billion to increase monthly benefit levels to an average of $133. This amounted to a 13.6 percent funding increase for SNAP recipients.

This temporary expansion expired on November 1, 2013, resulting in a relative benefit decrease for SNAP households; on average, benefits decreased by 5 percent. According to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of four dropped from $668 to $632, while the maximum monthly benefit for an individual dropped from $200 to $189.

=== Corporate influence and support ===
In June 2014, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; reported that &quot;Overall, 18 percent of all food benefits money is spent at Walmart&quot;, and that Walmart had submitted a statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stating,

Companies that have lobbied on behalf of SNAP include PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, and the grocery chain Kroger. Kraft Foods, which receives &quot;One-sixth [of its] revenues ... from food stamp purchases&quot; also opposes food stamp cuts.

=== Proposed College Student Hunger Act of 2019 ===
Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congressman Al Lawson introduced the College Student Hunger Act of 2019 on July 17, 2019, in an attempt to extend SNAP benefits for college students in need; the act has not passed as of October 2022. The idea was to include both Pell Grant-eligible students and independent students. Warren and Lawson both believe that students have a right to both food and education, and the goal was to alleviate financial tension. This bill has been endorsed by several organizations including Bread for the World. Specifically, the Act would allow Pell-Grant eligible and independent students to qualify for benefits, lowers the 20 hours/week work requirement to 10 hours/week, and requires the Department of Education to notify Pell Grant eligible students of their SNAP eligibility. The student hunger pilot program will test different ways students can use SNAP benefits such as directly at the dining hall or indirectly to help pay for student meal plans.

=== 2020 COVID-19 and Pandemic-EBT Introduction ===
The Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020 provided the Secretary of Agriculture with authority to approve state agency plans for temporary emergency eligibility standards and benefit levels under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 after the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. These plans allowed for increased access to food and nutrition assistance, including increased benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The Secretary of Agriculture could also waive certain requirements, such as work requirements, in order to ensure those in need had access to assistance. March 2020 is estimated to be the start date.

This provision applies to children who would otherwise be eligible for free or reduced price meals under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. It allows states to provide meals to children during the school closures due to COVID-19. It does not require states to provide meals to children who do not qualify for free or reduced price meals.

School children eligible for emergency nutrition benefits receive temporary benefits loaded onto their EBT cards. As of mid-summer 2020, all states and territories eligible to provide these benefits (except Guam) have selected the option and issued these benefits to replace meals lost during the 2019–2020 school year. These benefits provide children with essential nutrition, allowing them to focus on their studies and grow academically. The benefits are also instrumental in helping to reduce food insecurity among children.

=== 2021 Thrifty Food Plan modernization and update ===
As directed by the US Farm Bill Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 and the Biden administration January 22, 2021 Executive Order, the USDA implemented the first cost adjustment to the Thrifty Food Plan since its introduction in 1975. The Thrifty Food Plan is not dependent on geographical location, rather everyone is allocated the same amount of money. The USDA went on the evaluate the four aspects including current food prices within the typical American diet, dietary guidance, and the available nutrients in food items. The &quot;Thrifty Food Plan, 2021&quot;, is based on the needs of a family of four as defined by law, and sets $835.57 as the monthly cost for the reference family. This is a 21.03% increase from the prior amount (adjusted for current prices), or an increase of $4.79 per day for the reference family of four, and sets $835.57 as the monthly cost for the reference family. These changes are permanent, and went into effect October 1, 2021.

===2022 outage===
On August 28, 2022, outages were reported across multiples states for the payment system, including the EBT program.

===2023 aid shrink===
The SNAP emergency allotments, a temporary increase in benefits implemented at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, were ended in March 2023 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. For the average recipient, the change would mean about $90 less per month.

==Eligibility==
Because SNAP is a means-tested program, recipients must meet all eligibility criteria in order to receive benefits. There are income and resource requirements for SNAP, as well as specific requirements for immigrants, elderly persons and persons with disabilities.

===Income requirements===
For income, individuals and households may qualify for benefits if they earn a gross monthly income and a net monthly income that is 130% and 100% or less, respectively, of the federal poverty level for a specific household size. For example: in Fiscal Year 2024, the SNAP-eligible gross monthly income limit is $1,580 for an individual. For a household of four, it is $3,250.

===Work requirements===

General work requirements apply to people aged 16 to 59 to participate in the program, exempting students, caregivers of children under 6 and incapacitated people, people unable to work due to a disability, and people in drug rehabilitation. Such recipients must work 30 hours a week, or register for work or participate in state training; they may not quit or decline a job offer without a good reason, or reduce hours below 30 per week if working. For able-bodied adults aged 18 to 49 without dependents under 18 in the household and who are not pregnant, there is a requirement for 80 hours per month spent at work, volunteering, workfare, or workforce training. Critics say opportunities for training or volunteering are limited. Individual states may waive the work requirements, with many states in high unemployment areas opting to loosen requirements for SNAP eligibility.

In December 2019, the Trump Administration proposed to limit states&#x27; ability to issue eligibility waivers to single able-bodied adults between 18 and 49, which would result in ineligibility of SNAP benefits to an estimated 688,000 people in April 2020.

===Resource requirements===
There is also a resource requirement for SNAP, although eligibility requirements vary slightly from state to state. Generally speaking, households may have up to $2,250 in a bank account or other countable sources. If at least one person is age 60 or older and/or has disabilities, households may have $3,500 in countable resources.

===Housing expenditure===
The lack of affordable housing in urban areas means that money that could have been spent on food is spent on housing expenses. Housing is generally considered affordable when it costs 30% or less of total household income; rising housing costs have made this ideal difficult to attain.

This is especially true in New York City, where 28% of rent stabilized tenants spend more than half their income on rent. Among lower income families the percentage is much higher. According to an estimate by the Community Service Society, 65% of New York City families living below the federal poverty line are paying more than half of their income toward rent.

The current eligibility criteria attempt to address this, by including a deduction for &quot;excess shelter costs&quot;. This applies only to households that spend more than half of their net income on rent. For the purpose of this calculation, a household&#x27;s net income is obtained by subtracting certain deductions from their gross (before deductions) income. If the household&#x27;s total expenditures on rent exceed 50% of that net income, then the net income is further reduced by the amount of rent that exceeds 50% of net income. For 2007, this deduction can be no more than $417, except in households that include an elderly or disabled person. Deductions include:

# a standard deduction that is subtracted from income for all recipients,
# an earned income deduction reflecting taxes and work expenses,
# a deduction for dependent care expenses related to work or training (up to certain limits),
# a deduction for child support payments,
# a deduction for medical expenses above a set amount per month (only available to elderly and disabled recipients), and
# a deduction for excessively high shelter expenses.

The adjusted net income, including the deduction for excess shelter costs, is used to determine whether a household is eligible for food stamps.

===Immigrant status and eligibility===
The 2002 Farm Bill restores SNAP eligibility to most legal immigrants that:
* Have lived in the country for 5 years; or
* Are receiving disability-related assistance or benefits; or
* Have children under 18

Certain non-citizens, such as those admitted for humanitarian reasons and those admitted for permanent residence, may also be eligible for SNAP. Eligible household members can get SNAP benefits even if there are other members of the household that are not eligible. Undocumented immigrants, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, are not eligible for SNAP.

=== Student eligibility ===
When CalFresh was first introduced, college students were not considered a main target for food assistance; most students at the time were from white, middle-class families, under the care of their parents and were young high school graduates without dependents to provide for. To prevent students from mis-using the system, students enrolled in higher education for at least half-time were automatically ineligible for SNAP.

However, many students nowadays come from low-income families, racial and ethnic minorities, have jobs, are parents, or are not recent high school graduates. Many college students are leaving their homes and managing their own finances for the first time in their lives and depending on where they go to school, there may be limited access to affordable and nutritious food, making students particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. In 2015, in response to the changing student population, the CalFresh Student Eligibility Amendment established exemptions to the rule in Section 273.5(a) of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations which excluded college students enrolled at least half-time from SNAP benefits. Commonly met exemptions include students be under 18 or over 49, physically or mentally unfit to work, participate in federal or state work study, be employed for at least 20 hours per week, participate in SNAP employment and training program, receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits, and caring for dependent children.

Unfortunately, many students are misinformed that using CalFresh or SNAP will negatively affect their financial aid packages and are worried about the stigma associated with food insecurity in college campuses. Out of fear of being ostracized by their peers, many college students simply do not apply or do not talk about the program, limiting awareness and the potential of CalFresh to eliminate college food insecurity. To counteract this, many recent legislations and changes to SNAP are focusing on SNAP education, outreach, and accessibility. For instance, the recently proposed College Student Hunger Act of 2019 focuses on improving student eligibility, increasing outreach and education for SNAP, and introduces a student hunger pilot program to test different ways CalFresh can be made more useful for students. The Act would allow Pell-Grant eligible and independent students to qualify for benefits, lowers the 20 hours/week work requirement to 10 hours/week, and requires the Department of Education to notify Pell Grant eligible students of their SNAP eligibility. The pilot program will test different ways students can use SNAP benefits such as directly at the dining hall or indirectly to help pay for student meal plans.

==Applying for SNAP benefits==
In order to apply for SNAP benefits, one must fill out an application and return said application to either the state or local SNAP office. Each state has a different application, which is usually available online. There is more information about various state applications processes, including locations of SNAP offices in various states, displayed on an interactive Outreach Map found on the FNS website. Individuals who believe they may be eligible for P.O.SNAP benefits may use the Food and Nutrition Services&#x27; SNAP Screening Tool, which can help gauge eligibility. 

=== Students ===
While many schools try to connect students to SNAP, students still struggle to qualify despite facing food insecurity, feel intimidated by the probing application process, and are often misinformed of how the program works. To avoid the stigma often attached with food insecurity, many college students simply do not apply. Many students are also misinformed that using CalFresh will negatively affect their financial aid packages. While there are about 4 million people enrolled in CalFresh, there are an additional 4 million eligible people who are not enrolled which may be due to incomplete applications, improper documentation, and the time it takes to verify applications. Fortunately, measures to make the application more accessible for students are underway. For instance, California SB 173—a bill by Senator Bill Dodd—will required colleges to alert any students participating in work-study of their SNAP eligibility and provide them with a more efficient and time-saving application process.

==SNAP Benefit Allotment and Eligible Food Items==
SNAP benefits ensure households can purchase a thrifty nutritious food plan given their net income and household size.

=== SNAP Benefit Allotment ===
The benefit allotment subtracts 30% of net monthly income from a maximum monthly allotment given household size. Net income accounts for deductions such as excess shelter costs, expected taxes, and dependent care. USDA sets the maximum monthly allotment based on the annual thrifty food plan, their lowest cost food plan that still maintains a healthy diet. For example, a family of four with no net income receives the maximum monthly allotment of $973 in 2024.

=== Eligible Food Items ===
As per USDA rules, households can use SNAP benefits to purchase:
* fruits and vegetables
* breads and cereals
* dairy products
* meats, poultry, and fish
* snack foods and non-alcoholic beverages
* Plants and seeds which are fit for household consumption.

Additionally, restaurants operating in certain areas may be permitted to accept SNAP benefits from eligible candidates like elderly, homeless or disabled people in return for affordable meals.

However, the USDA is clear that households cannot use SNAP benefits to purchase the following:
* Wine, beer, liquor, cigarettes or tobacco
* Certain nonfood items like:
** hygiene (soaps, deodorant, menstrual care)
** paper products, household supplies
** pet foods
* Hot prepared foods in grocery stores
* Food items that are consumable in the store
* Vitamins and medicines
* Live animals and birds.

==State options==

States are allowed under federal law to administer SNAP in different ways. As of April 2015, the USDA had published eleven periodic State Options Reports outlining variations in how states have administered the program. The USDA&#x27;s most recent State Options Report, published in April 2015, summarizes:

Some areas of differences among states include: when and how frequently SNAP recipients must report household circumstances; on whether the state agency acts on all reported changes or only some changes; whether the state uses a simplified method for determining the cost of doing business in cases where an applicant is self-employed; and whether legally obligated child support payments made to non-household members are counted as an income exclusion rather than a deduction.

State agencies also have an option to call their program SNAP; whether to continue to refer to their program under its former name, the Food Stamp Program; or whether to choose an alternate name. Among the 50 states plus the District of Columbia, 32 call their program SNAP; five continue to call the program the Food Stamp Program; and 16 have adopted their own name. For example, California calls its SNAP implementation &quot;CalFresh&quot;, while Arizona calls its program &quot;Nutrition Assistance&quot;.

==States and counties with highest use of SNAP per capita==
According to January 2015 figures reported by the Census Bureau and USDA and compiled by &quot;USA Today&quot;, the states and district with the most food stamp recipients per capita are:

According to June 2009 figures reported by the state agencies, the USDA, and Census Bureau, and compiled by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the individual counties with the highest levels of SNAP usage were:

==Impact==

During the recession of 2008, SNAP participation hit an all-time high. Arguing in support for SNAP, the Food Research and Action Center argued that &quot;putting more resources quickly into the hands of the people most likely to turn around and spend it can both boost the economy and cushion the hardships on vulnerable people who face a constant struggle against hunger.&quot; Researchers have found that every $1 that is spent from SNAP results in $1.73 of economic activity. In California, the cost-benefit ratio is even higher: for every $1 spent from SNAP between $3.67 to $8.34 is saved in health care costs. The Congressional Budget Office also rated an increase in SNAP benefits as one of the two most cost-effective of all spending and tax options it examined for boosting growth and jobs in a weak economy.

===Participants===

A summary statistical report indicated that an average of 44.2 million people used the program in FY 2016, down from 45.8 million in 2015 and below the 2013 peak of 47.6 million. SNAP is able to support 75% of those eligible for the program. Nearly 72 percent of SNAP participants are in families with children; more than one-quarter of participants are in households with seniors or people with disabilities.

, more than 15% of the U.S. population receive food assistance, and more than 20% in Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oregon and Tennessee. Washington, D.C., was the highest share of the population to receive food assistance at over 23%.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture (based on a study of data gathered in Fiscal Year 2010), statistics for the food stamp program are as follows:
* 49% of all participant households have children (17 or younger), and 55% of those are single-parent households.
* 15% of all participant households have elderly (age 60 or over) members.
* 20% of all participant households have non-elderly disabled members.
* The average gross monthly income per food stamp household is $731; The average net income is $336.
* 37% of participants are White, 22% are African-American, 10% are Hispanic, 2% are Asian, 4% are Native American, and 19% are of unknown race or ethnicity.
Based on income and family structure, SNAP does not target specific racial and ethnic groups. As a result, SNAP benefits reach a broad range of disadvantaged households; yet, minority households report food insecurity at a rate more than twice that of White households.

===Costs===
Amounts paid to program beneficiaries rose from $28.6 billion in 2005 to $76 billion in 2013, falling back to $66.6 billion by 2016. This increase was due to the high unemployment rate (leading to higher SNAP participation) and the increased benefit per person with the passing of ARRA. SNAP average monthly benefits increased from $96.18 per person to $133.08 per person. Other program costs, which include the Federal share of State administrative expenses, Nutrition Education, and Employment and Training, amounted to roughly $3.7 million in 2013. There were cuts into the program&#x27;s budget introduced in 2014 that were estimated to save $8.6 billion over 10 years. Some of the states are looking for measures within the states to balance the cuts, so they would not affect the recipients of the federal aid program.

===Politics===
According to a 2021 study, the staggered decade-long rollout of the American Food Stamp Program led to greater support for Democrats: &quot;Overall, I find that Democrats—at the center of the program&#x27;s enacting coalition—gained votes when the program was implemented locally, apparently through mobilization of new supporters rather than the conversion of political opponents.&quot;

===Health===
A 2018 study found that toddlers and preschoolers in households with access to food stamps had better health outcomes at ages 6–16 than similar children who did not have access to food stamps. A 2019 study found, &quot;higher participation in SNAP is associated with lower overall and male suicide rates. Increasing SNAP participation by one standard deviation (4.5% of the state population) during the study period could have saved the lives of approximately 31,600 people overall and 24,800 men.&quot;

====Brain health and aging====
A 2022 study showed that users of the program aged 50 and above had slower memory loss, or &quot;about 2 fewer years of cognitive aging over a 10-year period compared with non-users&quot;, despite the program having nearly no conditions for the sustainability and healthiness of the food products purchased with the coupons (or coupon-credits).

==== Obesity prevalence amongst youth ====
Although SNAP has had positive impacts on reducing food insecurity, the nutrition options offered by the program do not consistently meet dietary guidelines. A study conducted in 2023 showed that participating children in particular perform poorly on health indicators compared with income-eligible and higher income nonparticipants.

=== Food security and insecurity ===
Low income participants along with SNAP participants spend similar amount on food. Yet, SNAP participants continue to experience greater food insecurity than non participants. This is believed to be a reflection of the welfare of individuals who take the time to apply for SNAP benefits rather than the shortcomings of SNAP. Households facing the greatest hardships are the most likely to bear the burden of applying for program benefits. Therefore, SNAP participants tend to be, on average, less food secure than other low-income nonparticipants. SNAP has been seen to provide around $1.40 less in terms of benefits than individuals need. Thus SNAP participants need to visit food banks, food parcels, food distribution sites, etc. in order to get the enough nutritious food.

Self-selection by more food-needy households into SNAP makes it difficult to observe positive effects on food security from survey data, but data such as average income can be compared. SNAP allows individuals to go to grocery stores and buy what foods are needed with their EBT cards. However, simply receiving food is not enough, since many individuals do not know which foods are most nutritious, nor how to prepare and cook those foods.

Crime

A 2019 study in the &quot;American Economic Journal: Economic Policy&quot; found that a lifetime food stamp ban (as implemented by the 1996 Welfare reform) for convicted drug felons led to greater recidivism. The study found that this applied in particular for financially motivated crimes, which the authors said suggested &quot;that the cut in benefits causes ex-convicts to return to crime to make up for the lost transfer income.&quot;

A 2021 study found that the availability of food stamps during early childhood substantially reduced the likelihood of a criminal conviction in young adulthood. The study concluded that the social benefits of food stamps were substantial enough to outweigh the costs of the program.

Poverty

Because SNAP is a means-tested entitlement program, participation rates are closely related to the number of individuals living in poverty in a given period. In periods of economic recession, SNAP enrollment tends to increase and in periods of prosperity, SNAP participation tends to be lower. Unemployment is therefore also related to SNAP participation. However, ERS data shows that poverty and SNAP participation levels have continued to rise following the 2008 recession, even though unemployment rates have leveled off. Poverty levels are the strongest correlates for program participation.

SNAP benefits [have led] to greater expenditures in healthcare, childcare, education and housing. Low wages and unstable working conditions have also impacted the ability to pay for transportation costs, which is needed for access to grocery stores and supermarkets.

===Income maintenance===
The purpose of the Food Stamp Program as laid out in its implementation was to assist low-income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to Peter H. Rossi, a sociologist whose work involved evaluation of social programs, &quot;the program rests on the assumption that households with restricted incomes may skimp on food purchases and live on diets that are inadequate in quantity and quality, or, alternatively skimp on other necessities to maintain an adequate diet&quot;. Food stamps, as many like Rossi, MacDonald, and Eisinger contend, are used not only for increasing food but also as income maintenance. Income maintenance is money that households are able to spend on other things because they no longer have to spend it on food. According to various studies shown by Rossi, because of income maintenance only about $0.17–$0.47 more is being spent on food for every food stamp dollar than was spent prior to individuals receiving food stamps.

===Diet quality===
Healthy and nutritious foods, such as raw produce, fish, and grains, on average cost much more than less nutritious, processed food options on a daily basis. As a result, maintaining a healthy diet is elusive and nearly impossible for low-income families. Many low income areas have fewer grocery stores and within those, poorer quality foods. CalFresh can help expand family&#x27;s budgets so they can afford healthy, nourishing foods. Studies are inconclusive as to whether SNAP has a direct effect on the nutritional quality of food choices made by participants. Unlike other federal programs that provide food subsidies, i.e. the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), SNAP does not have nutritional standards for purchases. Critics of the program suggest that this lack of structure represents a missed opportunity for public health advancement and cost containment. In April 2013, the USDA research body, the Economic Research Service (ERS), published a study that examined diet quality in SNAP participants compared to low-income nonparticipants. The study revealed a difference in diet quality between SNAP participants and low-income nonparticipants, finding that SNAP participants score slightly lower on the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) than nonparticipants. The study also concluded that SNAP increases the likelihood that participants will consume whole fruit by 23 percentage points. However, the analysis also suggests that SNAP participation decreases participants&#x27; intake of dark green and orange vegetables by a modest amount.

A 2016 study found no evidence that SNAP increased expenditures on tobacco by beneficiaries.

===Macroeconomic effect===
The USDA&#x27;s Economic Research Service explains: &quot;SNAP is a counter-cyclical government assistance program—it provides assistance to more low-income households during an economic downturn or recession and to fewer households during an economic expansion. The rise in SNAP participation during an economic downturn results in greater SNAP expenditures which, in turn, stimulate the economy.&quot;

In 2011, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack gave a statement regarding SNAP benefits: &quot;Every dollar of SNAP benefits generates $1.84 in the economy in terms of economic activity.&quot; Vilsack&#x27;s estimate was based on a 2002 USDA study which found that &quot;ultimately, the additional $5 billion of FSP (Food Stamp Program) expenditures triggered an increase in total economic activity (production, sales, and value of shipments) of $9.2 billion and an increase in jobs of 82,100&quot;, or $1.84 stimulus for every dollar spent.

A January 2008 report by Moody&#x27;s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi analyzed measures of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 and found that in a weak economy, every $1 in SNAP expenditures generates $1.73 in real GDP increase, making it the most effective stimulus among all the provisions of the act, including both tax cuts and spending increases.

A 2010 report by Kenneth Hanson published by the USDA&#x27;s Economic Research Service estimated that a $1 billion increase in SNAP expenditures increases economic activity (GDP) by $1.79 billion (i.e., the GDP multiplier is 1.79). The same report also estimated that the &quot;preferred jobs impact ... are the 8,900 full-time equivalent jobs plus self-employed or the 9,800 full-time and part-time jobs plus self-employed from $1 billion of SNAP benefits.&quot;

=== Local economic effects ===
In March 2013, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that one-third of Woonsocket, Rhode Island&#x27;s population used food stamps, putting local merchants on a &quot;boom or bust&quot; cycle each month when EBT payments were deposited. The Post stated that &quot;a federal program that began as a last resort for a few million hungry people has grown into an economic lifeline for entire towns.&quot; And this growth &quot;has been especially swift in once-prosperous places hit by the housing bust&quot;.

In addition to local town merchants, national retailers are starting to take in an increasing large percentage of SNAP benefits. For example, &quot;Walmart estimates it takes in about 18% of total U.S. outlays on food stamps.&quot;

===Fraud and abuse===
In March 2012, the USDA published its fifth report in a series of periodic analyses to estimate the extent of trafficking in SNAP; that is, selling or otherwise converting SNAP benefits for cash payouts. Although trafficking does not directly increase costs to the Federal Government, it diverts benefits from their intended purpose of helping low-income families access a nutritious diet. Also trafficking may indirectly increase costs by encouraging participants to stay in the program longer than intended, or by incentivizing new participants seeking to profit from trafficking. The FNS aggressively acts to control trafficking by using SNAP purchase data to identify suspicious transaction patterns, conducting undercover investigations, and collaborating with other investigative agencies.

Trafficking diverted an estimated one cent of each SNAP dollar ($330 million annually) from SNAP benefits between 2006 and 2008. Trafficking has declined over time from nearly 4 percent in the 1990s. About 8.2 percent of all stores trafficked from 2006 to 2008 compared to the 10.5 percent of SNAP authorized stores involved in trafficking in 2011. A variety of store characteristics and settings were related to the level of trafficking. Although large stores accounted for 87.3 percent of all SNAP redemptions, they only accounted for about 5.4 percent of trafficking redemptions. Trafficking was much less likely to occur among publicly owned than privately owned stores and was much less likely among stores in areas with less poverty rather than more. The total annual value of trafficked benefits increased at about the same rate as overall program growth. The current estimate of total SNAP dollars trafficked is higher than observed in the previous 2002–2005 period. This increase is consistent, however, with the almost 37 percent growths in average annual SNAP benefits from the 2002–2005 study periods to the most recent one. The methodology used to generate these estimates has known limitations. However, given variable data and resources, it is the most practical approach available to FNS. Further improvements to SNAP trafficking estimates would require new resources to assess the prevalence of trafficking among a random sample of stores.

The USDA report released in August 2013 says the dollar value of trafficking increased to 1.3 percent, up from 1 percent in the USDA&#x27;s 2006–2008 survey, and &quot;About 18 percent of those stores classified as convenience stores or small groceries were estimated to have trafficked. For larger stores (supermarkets and large groceries), only 0.32 percent were estimated to have trafficked. In terms of redemptions, about 17 percent of small groceries redemptions and 14 percent of convenience store redemptions were estimated to have been trafficked. This compares with a rate of 0.2 percent for large stores.&quot;

The USDA, in December 2011, announced new policies to attempt to curb waste, fraud, and abuse. These changes will include stiffer penalties for retailers who are caught participating in illegal or fraudulent activities. &quot;The department is proposing increasing penalties for retailers and providing states with access to large federal databases they would be required to use to verify information from applicants. SNAP benefit fraud, generally in the form of store employees buying EBT cards from recipients is widespread in urban areas, with one in seven corner stores engaging in such behavior, according to a recent government estimate. There are in excess of 200,000 stores, and we have 100 agents spread across the country. Some do undercover work, but the principal way we track fraud is through analyzing electronic transactions&quot; for suspicious patterns, USDA Under Secretary Kevin Concannon told The Washington Times. Also, states will be given additional guidance that will help develop a tighter policy for those seeking to effectively investigate fraud and clarifying the definition of trafficking.

The State of Utah developed a system called &quot;eFind&quot; to monitor, evaluate and cross-examine qualifying and reporting data of recipients assets. Utah&#x27;s eFind system is a &quot;back end&quot;, web-based system that gathers, filters, and organizes information from various federal, state, and local databases. The data in eFind is used to help state eligibility workers determine applicants&#x27; eligibility for public assistance programs, including Medicaid, CHIP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and child care assistance. When information is changed in one database, the reported changes become available to other departments utilizing the system. This system was developed with federal funds and it is available to other states free of charge.

The USDA only reports direct fraud and trafficking in benefits, which was officially estimated at $858 million in 2012. The Cato Institute reports that there was another $2.2 billion in erroneous payouts in 2009. Cato also reported that the erroneous payout rate dropped significantly from 5.6 percent in 2007 to 3.8 percent in 2011.

According to the Government Accountability Office, at a 2009 count, there was a payment error rate of 4.36% of SNAP benefits down from 9.86% in 1999. A 2003 analysis found that two-thirds of all improper payments were the fault of the caseworker, not the participant. There are also instances of fraud involving exchange of SNAP benefits for cash and/or for items not eligible for purchase with EBT cards. In 2011, the Michigan program raised eligibility requirements for full-time college students, to save taxpayer money and to end student use of monthly SNAP benefits.

==== Water dumping/container deposit cashing fraud ====
In February 2013, the USDA expanded the definition of benefits trafficking to include indirect exchanges and &quot;water dumping&quot;. The USDA defines water dumping as &quot;purchase of beverages in containers with returnable deposits for the sole purpose of discarding the contents and returning the containers to obtain cash refund deposits&quot; Trafficking is the most egregious program violation.

In Maine, incidents of recycling fraud have occurred in the past where individuals once committed fraud by using their EBT cards to buy canned or bottled beverages (requiring a deposit to be paid at the point of purchase for each beverage container), dump the contents out so the empty beverage container could be returned for deposit redemption, and thereby, allowed these individuals to eventually purchase non-EBT authorized products with cash from the beverage container deposits. In January 2011, Maine state prosecutors requested local law enforcement agencies to send reports of &quot;water dumping&quot; to welfare fraud prosecutor in the state attorney general&#x27;s office. In January 2016, a Maine woman, Linda Goodman, who purchased $125 in bottled water, dumping them and redeeming containers for cash to purchase alcohol, was charged with welfare fraud and pleaded no contest to SNAP trafficking. She was fined and suspended from SNAP eligibility for one year.

====Pop Train====
Similarly, Pop Train is a scheme of using SNAP card benefits to purchase soda and then re-selling the soda to turn a profit.

==Role of SNAP in healthy diets==

===Healthy Incentives Pilot===
The 2008 Farm Bill authorized $20 million to be spent on pilot projects to determine whether incentives provided to SNAP recipients at the point-of-sale would increase the purchase of fruits, vegetables, or other healthful foods. Fifteen states expressed interest in having the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) program and, ultimately, five states submitted applications to be considered for HIP. Hampden County, Massachusetts was selected as the Healthy Incentives Pilot site. HIP operated between November 2011 and December 2012. The Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) was the state agency responsible for SNAP. DTA recruited retailers to take part in HIP and sell more produce, planned for the EBT system change with the state EBT vendor, and hired six new staff members dedicated to HIP. DTA provided FNS with monthly reports, data collection and evaluation. 
HIP offered select SNAP recipients a 30% subsidy on produce, which was credited to the participant&#x27;s EBT card. Out of approximately 55,000 SNAP households in Hampden County, 7,500 households participated in HIP. Under HIP, produce is defined as fresh, frozen, canned, or dried fruits and vegetables that do not have any added sugar, salt, fat, or oil.

On average, people in the HIP program ate about a quarter cup (26 percent) more fruits and vegetables per day than SNAP recipients who did not receive the incentives. HIP participants were more likely to have fruits and vegetables available at home during the pilot. If the program were implemented nationwide, the estimated cost would be approximately $90 million over five years.

=== Proposals to restrict &quot;junk food&quot; or &quot;luxury items&quot; ===
Periodically, proposals have been raised to restrict SNAP benefits from being used to purchase various categories or types of food which have been criticized as &quot;junk food&quot; or &quot;luxury items&quot;. However, Congress and the Department of Agriculture have repeatedly rejected such proposals on both administrative burden and personal freedom grounds. The Food and Nutrition Service noted in 2007 that no federal standards exist to determine which foods should be considered &quot;healthy&quot; or not, that &quot;vegetables, fruits, grain products, meat and meat alternatives account for nearly three-quarters of the money value of food used by food stamp households&quot; and that &quot;food stamp recipients are no more likely to consume soft drinks than are higher-income individuals, and are less likely to consume sweets and salty snacks.&quot; Thomas Farley and Russell Sykes argued that the USDA should reconsider the possibility of restricting &quot;junk food&quot; purchases with SNAP in order to encourage healthy eating, along with incentivizing the purchase of healthy items through a credit or rebate program that makes foods such as fresh vegetables and meats cheaper. They also noted that many urban food stores do a poor job of stocking healthy foods and instead favor high-profit processed items. Some data suggests that it would benefit public health by making sugar-sweetened beverages ineligible to purchase with SNAP benefits. SNAP households use about 10% of their food budgets on sugar-sweetened beverages. Removing eligibility for sugar-sweetened beverages could result in a 2.4% reduction in obesity prevalence, 1.7% reduction in type II diabetes prevalence, and elimination of 52,000 deaths from stroke and heart attack over the course of ten years. The soda and broader food industries have received criticism for lobbying against reforms that would exclude &quot;junk food&quot; including soda from purchase with SNAP funds.

The original implementation of food stamps was intended to help working farmers earn fair wages. The passing of the Food Stamp Act of 1964 that eliminated the surplus produce clause for blue stamps helped to boost the market for processed food retailers. After 1964, when the program grew more expensive and economic effects of the Depression and world wars were forgotten, Congress introduced more intense eligibility standards for the program in an attempt to mitigate costs that went towards helping those in need. Through the 1970s and 1980s many communities made claims that federal safety net and private charities were failing to meet the needs of poor individuals who needed greater resources and access to food.

By 1994, SNAP&#x27;s program enrollment seemed to see growth once more, with an enrollment of 27 million people. By 1996, President Clinton&#x27;s Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act restricted eligibility even further, reinforced even stronger working requirements, restricted given benefits, and increased penalties for non-compliance.

<text>Vasily Ivanovich Surikov (; 24 January 1848 – 19 March 1916) was a Russian realist history painter. Many of his works have become familiar to the general public through their use as illustrations.

== Biography ==
He was born to an old family descending from Don Cossacks that had settled in Siberia. His father was a Collegiate Registrar, a civil service rank that often served as postmasters. In 1854, as a result of his father being reassigned, the family moved to the village of Sukhobuzimskoye, where he began his primary education.

In 1859, his father died of tuberculosis so the family returned to Krasnoyarsk and were forced to rent the second floor of their house to survive financially. He began drawing while attending the district school and was encouraged by the local art teacher. His first formal work dates from 1862, but his family could not afford to continue his education, and he became a clerk in a government office. This brought him into contact with , the governor of Yenisei, who was able to find him a patron: , a local merchant who owned several small gold mines.

In 1868, he rode on horseback to Saint Petersburg but was unable to qualify for admission to the Imperial Academy of Arts, so he studied at the drawing school of the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts. After a year there, he was allowed to audit classes at the academy and became a full-time pupil toward the end of 1869.

From 1869 to 1875, he studied with Pavel Chistyakov, Bogdan Willewalde, and Pyotr Shamshin, winning several medals. His great attention to composition earned him the nickname &quot;The Composer&quot;. In 1875, he graduated with the title of Artist, first degree.

===Career in Moscow===
In 1877, he received a commission to paint murals at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (then still under construction), and he moved to Moscow. Unable to afford a house, he lived in rented apartments and hotels and visited Krasnoyarsk whenever possible. In 1878, he married Elisabeth Charais (1858–1888), a French woman who was descended from the Decembrist, , on her mother&#x27;s side. They had two daughters.

After that, he chose to remain in Moscow and began the series of historical paintings that would establish his reputation, starting with &quot;The Morning of the Streltsy Execution&quot;. In 1881, he had his first exhibition with the Peredvizhniki, an artists&#x27; cooperative. In 1883, &quot;Menshikov in Beryozovo&quot; was bought by Pavel Tretyakov for a sum that allowed him to take a European tour. In 1887, he added portraits to his repertoire, beginning with one of his mother.

In 1888, his wife died, and he returned to Krasnoyarsk with his daughters for two years. There he painted his most lighthearted picture, &quot;The Capture of Snow Town&quot;. This was followed by a visit to his ancestral home in Siberia. There, on the Ob River, he made sketches for one of his most familiar works, &quot;The Conquest of Siberia by Yermak Timofeyevich&quot; (an event in which some of his ancestors had participated). This brought him a full membership in the Imperial Academy. In 1897, he visited Switzerland and painted &quot;Suvorov Crossing the Alps&quot;, which was purchased by Tsar Nicholas II.

In 1907, he left the Peredvizhniki and joined the Union of Russian Artists. Three years later, he visited Spain, together with his son-in-law, Pyotr Konchalovsky. That same year, he and the architect Leonid Chernishyov opened an art school. Four years later, he had an extended stay in Krasnoyarsk, painting landscapes.

By this time, he was suffering from chronic coronary disease. A trip to Crimea for treatment in 1915 failed to ameliorate the problem, and he died early the following year after returning to Moscow. He was buried at Vagankovo Cemetery, next to his wife.

In 1948, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, his estate in Krasnoyarsk became a museum. Two monuments have been erected there, in 1954 and in 2002. A biographical movie of his life (&quot;Vasily Surikov&quot;) was made by Mosfilm in 1959, written by Emil Braginsky, and directed by , with Yevgeni Lazarev as Surikov and Larisa Kadochnikova as Elisabeth. Numerous streets and squares throughout Russia have been named after him, as well as a crater on Mercury.

<text>Quantum information science is a field that combines the principles of quantum mechanics with information theory to study the processing, analysis, and transmission of information. It covers both theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum physics, including the limits of what can be achieved with quantum information. The term quantum information theory is sometimes used, but it does not include experimental research and can be confused with a subfield of quantum information science that deals with the processing of quantum information.

==Scientific and engineering studies==
Quantum teleportation, entanglement and the manufacturing of quantum computers depend on a comprehensive understanding of quantum physics and engineering. Google and IBM have invested significantly in quantum computer hardware research, leading to significant progress in manufacturing quantum computers since the 2010s. Currently, it is possible to create a quantum computer with over 100 qubits, but the error rate is high due to the lack of suitable materials for quantum computer manufacturing. Majorana fermions may be a crucial missing material.

Quantum cryptography devices are now available for commercial use. The one time pad, a cipher used by spies during the Cold War, uses a sequence of random keys for encryption. These keys can be securely exchanged using quantum entangled particle pairs, as the principles of the no-cloning theorem and wave function collapse ensure the secure exchange of the random keys. The development of devices that can transmit quantum entangled particles is a significant scientific and engineering goal.

Qiskit, Cirq and Q Sharp are popular quantum programming languages. Additional programming languages for quantum computers are needed, as well as a larger community of competent quantum programmers. To this end, additional learning resources are needed, since there are many fundamental differences in quantum programming which limits the number of skills that can be carried over from traditional programming.

==Related mathematical subjects==
Quantum algorithms and quantum complexity theory are two of the subjects in algorithms and computational complexity theory. In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor introduced a quantum algorithm for prime factorization that, with a quantum computer containing 4,000 logical qubits, could potentially break widely used ciphers like RSA and ECC, posing a major security threat. This led to increased investment in quantum computing research and the development of post-quantum cryptography to prepare for the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era.

<text>Bonsal is an unincorporated community in the New Hill, North Carolina postal district, in extreme southwestern Wake County, North Carolina, United States. Bonsal was a railroad junction between the Durham &amp; South Carolina Railroad (D&amp;SC) (originally chartered as the New Hope Valley Railroad) and the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (originally the Raleigh and Augusta Air Line Railroad). The New Hope Valley Railroad route was abandoned in the late 1970s.

The original name of the community was Godsey after the Godsey Farm in the area, but this was changed to Bonsal in 1905 after William Roscoe Bonsal, builder and first President of the Durham &amp; South Carolina Railroad (see below). The community was briefly incorporated from 1907 to 1917 to allow the citizens to vote in favor of bills supporting temperance and prohibition. The town charter was revoked in 1917 when the citizens, having accomplished their purpose for being incorporated at all, refused to pay town taxes.

Bonsal is now the site of the North Carolina Railway Museum (NCRM) and the operating New Hope Valley Railway (NHVRy) tourist line. The line owns approximately 6 miles of track between Bonsal and New Hill, North Carolina, operating for passengers on the first Sunday of each month from May to November and both Saturday and Sunday the first two weekends in December. Other special event trains are operated at other times throughout the year.

The railway north of New Hill, North Carolina has been converted into the American Tobacco Trail.

<doc id="659100" wikidata="Q5245498" url="?curid=659100" title="Dead metaphor">
<text>A dead metaphor is a figure of speech which has lost the original imagery of its meaning by extensive, repetitive, and popular usage, or because it refers to an obsolete technology or forgotten custom. Because dead metaphors have a conventional meaning that differs from the original, they can be understood without knowing their earlier connotation.

==Description==
Dead metaphors are generally the result of a semantic shift in the evolution of a language, a process called the literalization of a metaphor. A distinction is often made between those dead metaphors whose origins are entirely unknown to the majority of people using them (such as the expression &quot;to kick the bucket&quot;) and those whose source is widely known or symbolism easily understood but not often thought about (the idea of &quot;falling in love&quot;). 

The long standing metaphorical application of a term can similarly lose their metaphorical quality, coming simply to denote a larger application of the term. The wings of a plane now no longer seem to metaphorically refer to a bird&#x27;s wings; rather, the term &#x27;wing&#x27; was expanded to include non-living things. Similarly, the legs of a chair is no longer a metaphor but an expansion of the term &quot;leg&quot; to include any supporting pillar. 

There is debate among literary scholars whether so-called &quot;dead metaphors&quot; are dead or are metaphors. Literary scholar R.W. Gibbs noted that for a metaphor to be dead, it would necessarily lose the metaphorical qualities that it comprises. These qualities, however, still remain. A person can understand the expression &quot;falling head-over-heels in love&quot; even if they have never encountered that variant of the phrase &quot;falling in love&quot;. Analytic philosopher Max Black argued that the dead metaphor should not be considered a metaphor at all, but rather classified as a separate vocabulary item.

In addition, philosophers such as Colin Murray Turbayne and Kendall Walton have outlined the manner in which &quot;dead metaphors&quot; may continue to exert influence upon a user&#x27;s thoughts long after their metaphorical properties have seemingly vanished. Their research illustrates the manner in which &quot;dead metaphors&quot; have often become incorporated into accepted scientific and philosophical theories while also contributing to considerable obfuscation of thought over time.

==Examples==

* (in reference to a centrifugal governor)
* (in reference to grips on aircraft controls)
* Beyond the pale (in reference to a boundary fence)
* Cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey
* Cut! (in film)
* Fly off the handle (in reference to an ax head)

* 
* Hang up the phone
* Go (refers to horse riding)
* Hold your horses
* Let one&#x27;s hair down

* To take a parting shot (Parthian shot)
* Patching code (refers to paper tape)
* (in reference to a pipe organ)

* Roll up the window
* Sound like a 
* To something (to record)
* Time is running out (in reference to an hourglass)

<text>According to Catholic Tradition, Trophimus of Arles () was the first bishop of Arles, in today&#x27;s southern France.

==History==
It was an early tradition of the Catholic Church that under the co-Emperors Decius and Herennius Etruscus (251 AD), Pope Fabian sent out seven bishops from Rome to Gaul, to preach the Gospel: Gatien to Tours, Trophimus to Arles, Paul to Narbonne, Saturninus to Toulouse, Denis to Paris, Austromoine to Clermont, and Martial to Limoges.

Gregory of Tours, apparently quoting from the &quot;Acta&quot; of Saint Saturninus, says in effect that Trophimus arrived in Gaul with the first bishops of Tours, Paris, and other cities after the middle of 3rd century, in the consulate of Decius and Gratus.

From the mid-fifth century local tradition has assimilated Trophimus of Arles with the Trophimus mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as a companion of Paul the Apostle. The &quot;Martyrium romanum&quot; identifies him as the disciple of Paul, but the identification is spurious. Trophîme, as he is in French, does not rate a biography in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, but the church at Arles dedicated to him, built from the 12th century onwards over a third-century crypt, is one of the monuments of Romanesque architecture and sculpture in Provence. In its cloister a corner figure in the north gallery, dated about 1180, represents Trophimus.

Trophimus is considered by the Catholic Church the protector of those with gout.

<doc id="659115" wikidata="Q6779425" url="?curid=659115" title="Mary Elizabeth Price">
<text>Mary Elizabeth Price (March 1, 1877 – February 19, 1965), also known as M. Elizabeth Price, was an American Impressionist painter. She was an early member of the Philadelphia Ten, organizing several of the group&#x27;s exhibitions. She steadily exhibited her works with the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the National Academy of Design, and other organizations over the course of her career. She was one of the several family members who entered the field of art as artists, dealers, or framemakers.

==Early life==
Mary Elizabeth Price was born in 1877 in Martinsburg, West Virginia. Her parents were Quakers Reuben Moore and Caroline Cooper Paxson Price who lived in Shenandoah, Virginia. Price spent her childhood in Virginia, West Virginia, and then most of her childhood in Solebury Township, north of New Hope where her mother was born. She had a sister, Alice, and three brothers, Frederick Newlin, Rueben Moore, and Carroll Price. M. Elizabeth Price graduated from the Friends&#x27; Central School.

==Education==
Price studied from about 1896 to 1904 at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art and from about 1904 to 1907 at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts under Hugh Breckenridge and Daniel Garber. She took private lessons from William Langson Lathrop.

==Career==
===Instructor===
Price was in New York in 1917 when she taught art to children who attended public schools at the Neighborhood Art School of Greenwich House. The program was funded by Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney to teach children painting, drawing, pottery, wood carving, and sculpting. In the winter of 1919–1920, Price exhibited the children&#x27;s work, as part of an art education campaign with other schools, at the suggestion of Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh.

===Works===
Inspired by the painters from Siena and Florence during the Italian Renaissance, Price is best known for her floral still life paintings which used gold and silver leaf. Her works were created by first applying red clay and gesso to wooden panels. Metal leaf was added and then oils painted on the panels of figures or flowers. She created large gilded panels with this technique. &quot;Her work combines a Sienese delicacy of line with a modern freedom in the use of color,&quot; wrote a &quot;New York Times&quot; critic. Examples of such work, including &quot;Mallows&quot; (1929) and &quot;Delphinium Pattern&quot; (ca. 1933), were included in &quot;The Painterly Voice: Bucks County&#x27;s Fertile Ground&quot;, a 2011 exhibition of the James A. Michener Art Museum. She also painted landscapes, genre scenes, and ships, including a unique series of Spanish treasure ships. One of her floral paintings, made of a Marsh Mallow, was appraised at $40,000 to $60,000 by Robin Starr on the PBS &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in 2011.

She created murals of 18th and 19th-century needlework samplers in 1931 with Lucille Howard, who she shared a studio and was also a member of the Philadelphia Ten. The murals were made for the clubhouse of the American Woman&#x27;s Association in New York at 353 West 57th Street. A still life painting of fruit is owned by Smith College and was hung in the Jordan House in 1922.

===Exhibitions===

She exhibited her works in 1914 at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and in Washington, D.C. at the Corcoran Gallery of Art Biennial. She continued to exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy annually for most years between 1917 and 1943. Between 1921 and 1934, Price exhibited 16 times at the National Academy of Design, where in 1927 she won the Carnegie Prize for best oil painting by an American artist, for her depiction of sixteenth-century Spanish galleons. Her work was exhibited in the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors&#x27; Fiftieth Anniversary Exhibition 1889–1939 in New York. She also exhibited at several other venues in the United States over her career.

===Membership===
As an early member of the Philadelphia Ten, a group of women artists begun in 1921, she organized exhibits and participated in solo and group shows in many galleries in New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., including Grand Central Art Galleries, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the National Academy of Design. Between 1920 and 1927, Price was the chair of the exhibition committee for the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and arranged 32 exhibitions across America, and in Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro.
She was also a member of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts fellowship, American Woman&#x27;s Association, American Artists Professional League, the Art Alliance of Philadelphia, Allied Artists of America, Fine Arts Society of Arkansas, Phillips Mill Community Art Association, and The Plastic Club.

==Price family==

One of Price&#x27;s brothers, Frederick, generally known as F. Newlin Price, owned the Ferargil Gallery in New York. It sold many Impressionist artists paintings, including those from Pennsylvania, from 1914 to 1955.

Her sister, Alice, was an artist and brother R. Moore Price was an artist, framemaker, and art dealer. His wife, Elizabeth Freedley Price, was an Impressionist painter. Her sister married Rae Sloan Bredin, another American impressionist painter living in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Her brother, Reuben Moore Price, was a member of the Bucks County arts and crafts frame making movement. Carroll, and his wife Edith, remained on the Solebury Township family farm.

==New Hope, Pennsylvania==

Price lived much of her early artistic life in New York City and then returned to Bucks County in New Hope, Pennsylvania in late the 1920s. She lived in Pumpkin Seed, an old yellow stone cottage, named for its size and color. The cottage, situated along a canal, had been rented by F. Newlin for several years. M. Elizabeth Price said of it, &quot;When I first saw the original cottage it was painted such a vivid yellow that I instinctively thought of a pumpkin; and it was so small that I named it Pumpkin Seed more in derision than anything else. But the quaintness of the name grew on us so that we&#x27;ve learned to love it.&quot; She grew a garden of irises, mallows, peonies, lilies, delphiniums, poppies, hollyhocks, and gladioli that she used as subjects for her paintings. She lived there for the rest of her life with her brother, who owned a house, farm, and property in the New Hope area. She gave lectures to the New Hope Women&#x27;s Club, where she showed her paintings and encouraged local artists.

==Death==
Mary Elizabeth Price died in Trenton, New Jersey on February 19, 1965 at Mercer Hospital. At the time of her death, she was a member of the Solebury Friends Meeting and, at the age of 87, had been the last living of the Price children. She was survived by her nieces and nephews. Price is buried in the Solebury Friends Meeting House cemetery.

Her papers are archived at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Portrait Gallery Library.

<doc id="659127" wikidata="Q6525415" url="?curid=659127" title="Leonard J. Arrington">
<text>Leonard James Arrington (July 2, 1917 – February 11, 1999) was an American author, academic and the founder of the Mormon History Association (MHA). He is known as the &quot;Dean of Mormon History&quot; and &quot;the Father of Mormon History&quot; because of his contributions to the field. From 1972 to 1982, he was Church Historian for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the first non-general authority to fill the assignment since it began in 1842. He was director of the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History from 1982 until 1986.
 
Arrington grew up in a large family in Idaho, where he and his family were members of the LDS Church. After high school, he studied agricultural economics at the University of Idaho (U of I) and continued studying economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). While teaching at the Utah State Agricultural College (later Utah State University (USU)) in Logan, Utah, Harvard University Press (HUP) published his book &quot;Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830–1900&quot; in 1958. After a Fulbright professorship at the University of Genoa in Italy, Arrington raised funds to pay for research and writing on Mormon biographies. He taught Western American History at Brigham Young University (BYU) from 1972 to 1987.

In conjunction with his teaching appointment at BYU, Arrington was also appointed as the first Church Historian for the LDS Church from 1972 to 1982. It was the first time a professional historian was given this job. Arrington and his team of researchers, forming the Church Historical Department, began many projects to document LDS Church history, ranging from articles for the church&#x27;s official magazine to scholarly books written for a non-LDS audience. The Historical Department was not subject to the church&#x27;s Correlation Program and enjoyed some freedom of research. However, over time, various church members and apostles disliked the historical articles. The new director of the Historical Department, G. Homer Durham, required that all publications go through him and halted the hiring of new employees. In 1982, the LDS Church released Arrington as Church Historian and transferred the History Division to BYU, creating the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History. Arrington published over 20 books and articles, including several biographies, with the help of many research assistants.

Arrington donated his research and personal papers to USU and also donated microfilms of his pre-1982 diaries to the LDS Church Archives, with the condition that the diaries not be read until 25 years after his death. However, the LDS Church broke the agreement when shortly after Arrington&#x27;s death they argued that they owned part of the collection, and asked Arrington&#x27;s daughter to excise portions of Arrington&#x27;s diary. After legal negotiation, half of a box of the collection was given to the LDS Church Archives.

==Early life==
Leonard Arrington was born in Twin Falls, Idaho on July 2, 1917, the third of eleven children. His parents, Noah and Edna, were farmers and devout Latter-day Saints, the largest and most well-known branch of Mormonism. Arrington grew up as an aspiring farmer and active member and one of the first national officers of the National FFA Organization. For his FFA independent project, he raised several hundred Rhode Island Red chickens and won a prize for them at the Idaho State Fair in 1934. The chicken project helped him win a Union Pacific Railroad scholarship.

Arrington was also a member of the Boy Scouts and read books by Ernest Thompson Seton, naturalist co-founder of the Boy Scouts. In the summers, he slept outside in the family orchard to have a quiet place to read and enjoyed an idyllic country life. On one evening observing nature, Arrington had a transcendent experience where he felt &quot;an intimate kinship with the world&quot; which he said &quot;made it easy for me [...] to integrate personal religious experiences and intuitions with the more formal affirmations, practices, forms, and ceremonies of the organized church.&quot;

During the Great Depression, Arrington was curious about the price of potatoes and set about his first economic experiment. He put slips of paper in some of the sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.

==Education==
Arrington&#x27;s father offered to pay for Arrington to serve as an LDS Church missionary, but not for a university education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the U of I, Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the U of I, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university&#x27;s newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.

Arrington graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1939. Arrington then began graduate work under a Kenan teaching fellowship at UNC. and married Grace Fort in 1942. She joined the LDS Church in 1946.

In World War II, he served in the Army in North Africa and Italy from 1942 to 1945. He worked in the prisoner-of-war (POW) processing division and for Italy&#x27;s Institute of Statistics. While stationed at a POW camp for Italian prisoners in North Africa, Arrington reported having another transcendent experience after reading &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;. He reported feeling that God wanted him to become a teacher and a writer about religion and economics.

==Academic career==

He was a professor at Utah State Agricultural College in Logan, Utah (which became USU in 1957) from 1946 to 1972. He completed a PhD in economics at UNC in 1952, taking a year&#x27;s leave from teaching and moving to North Carolina to complete his coursework. Arrington easily completed the coursework and examinations, as he had already been teaching much of the material and published several articles in the meantime.

In 1958, the HUP published Arrington&#x27;s &quot;Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830–1900&quot;, based on his doctoral dissertation, &quot;Mormon Economic Policies and Their Implementation on the Western Frontier, 1847–1900&quot;. &quot;Great Basin Kingdom&quot; was published through a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, which subsidized publication of books about economic history. Under the grant, all royalties went back into the fund to help publish more books; Arrington did not receive royalties from the book until the University of Utah reprinted it in 1993.

Arrington completed much of the research for &quot;Great Basin Kingdom&quot; in the LDS Church&#x27;s library archives. Aware of the hostile relationship the archives had at the time with academic research, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe&#x27;s advice and started his research with published materials and theses, working up to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund&#x27;s policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using carbon copy paper, enabling him to leave a copy with Lund and take his own copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into &quot;Great Basin Kingdom&quot;, Arrington took a sabbatical in 1956 and 1957 and was granted a fellowship at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.

In &quot;Great Basin Kingdom&quot;, Arrington traces the Mormon pioneer practices of &quot;central planning, organized cooperation, and the partial socialization of investment implicit in Mormon theory&quot; to the democratic theory of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Arrington also noted that pioneers found religious significance in creating farms out of previously wild land, making irrigation central to their way of life. The way Mormons freely distributed irrigation water—through a central canal and diverted when needed—reflected their communal values. While the Mormon cooperative economy died out in the 1880s, their cooperative spirit anticipated later governmental planning. &quot;Great Basin Kingdom&quot;&#x27;s thorough documentation called attention to previously hidden sources in the LDS Church Archives. Dean L. May and Donald Worster criticized &quot;Great Basin Kingdom&quot; for overreaching its thesis that organized irrigation could rejuvenate a culture. One biographer attributes Arrington&#x27;s overvaluing Mormon achievements to a lack of empirical studies on pioneer settlements at the time. Still, the book was received as an instant classic that raised the standard for Mormon scholarship. Dale L. Morgan, though critical of the lack of attention to the Gentile (i.e., non-Mormon) influence on Mormons, said that it was an indispensable ordering of Mormon data. The book is still considered one of the significant books on Mormon history.

From 1958 to 1959, he was a Fulbright Professor of American Economics at the University of Genoa in Italy. After returning from Italy, Arrington arranged for donations from patrons to fund the writing of Mormon biographies. Much of these biographies were researched and written by graduate students and other assistants, but published under Arrington&#x27;s name with acknowledgements of the student work. Also in 1959, Arrington wrote an article featured in the first issue of &quot;BYU Studies&quot; entitled &quot;An Economic Interpretation of &#x27;The Word of Wisdom.&#x27;&quot; The article argued that Brigham Young&#x27;s enforcement of the Word of Wisdom as a commandment was motivated by a desire to keep cash inside Utah (and not spent on luxury imports). &quot;BYU Studies&quot; was suspended for a year, which Ernest L. Wilkinson told Arrington was because of his revisionist history paper.

From 1966 to 1967 he worked as a visiting professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles. From 1972 to 1987 he was Lemuel H. Redd Jr. Professor of Western American History at BYU. In 1977, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the U of I (his alma mater), and in 1982 USU awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Humanities degree.

===Historical associations===
Arrington helped establish the MHA in 1965 and served as its first president from 1966 to 1967. After Arrington&#x27;s article caused the suspension of &quot;BYU studies&quot;, it became wary of publishing any controversial material. Arrington formed the MHA in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed anyone with an interest in Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting and proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in &quot;Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought&quot;, a publication he helped form. Johnson&#x27;s proposal was accepted and members of the Mormon History Association submitted papers to &quot;Dialogue&quot;.

Arrington also founded the &quot;Western Historical Quarterly&quot; and served as president of the Western History Association (1968–69), the Agricultural History Society (1969–70), and the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association (1981–82). For his distinction in writing American history he was awarded the Western History Association Prize in 1984 and he was made a Fellow of the Society of American Historians in 1986.

N. Eldon Tanner was made second counselor to LDS Church president David O. McKay, in 1963. Tanner met with the director of the BYU library at the time, S. Lyman Tyler, to coordinate the work of LDS historians with the LDS Church Archives. Arrington began attending these meetings in 1966.
After McKay died in 1970, the LDS Church Historian, Joseph Fielding Smith, succeeded him as church president. This left the position of official Church Historian—which was traditionally held by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—vacant. Apostle Howard W. Hunter was chosen as the next Church Historian, and he formed a committee of prominent Mormon historians to discuss reorganizing the Church History Department. As part of this reorganization, Arrington was appointed LDS Church Historian, replacing Hunter, in January 1972. At the same time, Arrington was appointed as &quot;Lemuel H. Redd Professor of Western History&quot; and Founding Director of the &quot;Charles Redd Center for Western Studies&quot; at BYU; his historian position was funded half by the church and half by BYU. The Church Historian&#x27;s Office was transformed into the church&#x27;s Historical Department, and Arrington was made director of its research-oriented History Division. It was the first time a professional historian rather than an administrator was given a church historian position. He hired Jim Allen and Davis Bitton as assistant church historians, whose positions were also funded half by the church and half by their universities.

Arrington and his assistants were supported by a team of editors, administrative assistants, research historians, oral history experts, and student interns. It was common for many individuals to work on a project; generally the principal author was listed in the article&#x27;s byline, but sometimes Arrington&#x27;s name was used to lend a publication authority. As a supervisor, Arrington was not a skillful bureaucrat, and junior staffers complained about their exclusion from decision-making and a lack of communication, which Arrington tried to ameliorate. Richard Bushman, a prominent Mormon historian, suggested that Arrington commission a multivolume history of the church, written mostly by scholars outside the history division staff. William Hartley, Gordon Irving, and Gary Shumway began an oral history program, funded by a grant from the descendants of James Moyle, a Utah politician. A summer research fellowship offered $1000 for outside scholars to use the LDS Church Archives for projects on Mormon history. Eugene England Sr. also donated money to support projects that Arrington deemed especially important. Additionally, a special Mormon History Trust Fund was formed from individual donations, including royalties donated by staff members.

===The Story of the Latter-day Saints===
During his time in the office, Arrington sponsored authors to write academic LDS Church histories. Among the best known works from this &quot;New Mormon History&quot; were two general church histories, one aimed at LDS Church members, &quot;The Story of the Latter-day Saints&quot;, and one for interested outsiders, &quot;The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints&quot;. Arrington also granted liberal access to church archival material to both Mormon and non-Mormon scholars. Arrington continued to professionalize the archives with the systematic cataloging started by Joseph Fielding Smith. This era is sometimes referred to as &quot;Camelot&quot; due to its open and idealistic ethos. The division&#x27;s output was not subject to the LDS Church&#x27;s Correlation Program. The Correlation Program edited officially published church materials, like instruction manuals and magazines, to ensure that they presented a consistent message that LDS Church authorities agreed on. Arrington, Bitton, Allen, and Maureen Beecher served as a reading committee for the division&#x27;s writings in place of formal Correlation approval. Arrington wanted to avoid the Correlation Program, stating that &quot;I do not think we could determine the truth of what had happened in history by having the Quorum of the Twelve vote on it.&quot;

===Mounting resistance===
The open and idealistic ethos did not last. The History Division&#x27;s immediate supervisors, Joseph Anderson and G. Homer Durham, failed to defend the division. Employees within the department, under the instruction of Mark E. Petersen, compiled what they believed to be heretical statements and passed them along to the Twelve and ultimately the offender&#x27;s bishop. In a 1973 meeting with the First Presidency, church president Harold B. Lee rejected proposals for a student research award and for a Friends of the Church History organization. Lee preferred that researchers clear sensitive archive research topics like polygamy with the First Presidency ahead of time. Staff historian D. Michael Quinn published an article in the LDS Church magazine, the &quot;Ensign&quot;, exploring the origins of the office of presiding bishop, and asserted that Edward Partridge was not the first incumbent. Although Quinn&#x27;s research was correct, space in the &quot;Ensign&quot; did not permit a complete documentation of Quinn&#x27;s research, and some readers felt the article insulted Partridge&#x27;s memory. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington submit an apology to readers; Arrington sent a message to the publisher with his regrets that the article&#x27;s format was unfortunate.

While many readers praised the division&#x27;s publications, some members criticized the new histories. In a meeting with institute teachers, Ezra Taft Benson, then president of the Twelve, obliquely criticized some of the terms used in &quot;The Story of the Latter-day Saints&quot;, like &quot;primitivist&quot; and &quot;communitarian&quot;. After the publication of Dean C. Jessee&#x27;s &quot;Letters of Brigham Young to His Sons&quot;, apostle Boyd K. Packer wrote a letter to the First Presidency objecting to the inclusion of Young&#x27;s tobacco use and the fact that his descendants were unhappy with the way Young&#x27;s will was carried out. Packer preferred that a sanitized version be published and believed that the History Division&#x27;s work ought to be sent through the Correlation Program. However, church president Kimball found &quot;The Story of the Latter-day Saints&quot; a &quot;great work&quot;. A University of Utah undergraduate wrote a research paper connecting the New Mormon History coming from the Church Division with secularism and the work of anti-Mormon historians Jerald and Sandra Tanner. The paper quoted interviews with Mormon historians that were very unlikely to have been real. A copy of the paper reached the Twelve via Mark E. Petersen, and as a result of the ensuing discussion, several LDS historians were barred from publishing in church sources. Other critics were similarly non-confrontational, but had enough influence to constrain and redirect the historical department.

G. Homer Durham, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, replaced Joseph Anderson as director of the Historical Department in 1977 and began restraining the History Division&#x27;s activity. Durham required that all manuscripts go through him for approval before publication. He attempted to combine the Mormon History Trust Fund with the general department budget but was prevented by Arrington. Durham also refrained from hiring new staff members to replace staff who had left. The multi-volume church history project was dropped, allowing the outside authors to seek publishers other than Deseret Book who would give them royalties and not be tempted to sanitize church history. Not all twelve authors completed their projects, but many books that started from the History Division project were later published through other publishers.

=== Departure ===
The church transferred its History Division to BYU in 1982, bringing the era of open LDS Church Archives to a close. Working in a new BYU division, the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History, brought Arrington into a more static situation, as he no longer divided his time between church headquarters and BYU. In February 1982, he was privately released as Church Historian and director of the History Division. These positions were assumed by Durham, who said that moving the team would save them from the increasing hostility from the Twelve. At the April 1982 general conference, the change was not formally announced and Arrington did not receive the traditional vote of thanks for his service.

In March 1982, Arrington&#x27;s wife Grace died. In November 1983, Arrington married Harriet Horne, granddaughter of Alice Merrill Horne. Arrington continued on as director of the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History until 1986 and he retired in 1987. In 2005, the Institute was closed and the department&#x27;s historians were returned to LDS Church Headquarters.

==Other writings==
Roland Rich Woolley, lawyer for several Hollywood celebrities, funded three biographies by Arrington. The first was a biography of Woolley&#x27;s father-in-law, William Spry. Woolley first hired popular writer William L. Roper to write the biography, but as the manuscript lacked professionalism, Roper hired Arrington to complete it. The biography focuses disproportionately on Spry&#x27;s decision to execute Joe Hill, reflecting Woolley&#x27;s conservative politics in suppressing labor radicalism.

Woolley&#x27;s choice of subjects for two additional biographies were his grandfathers Charles C. Rich and Edwin D. Woolley. With these biographies, Woolley gave Arrington complete control over the manuscripts. As Arrington was busy with university commitments at the time, he delegated much of the work to other historians, former students, and administrative assistants. The sources on Rich did not provide any introspection or motives for Rich&#x27;s actions, and his biography had to focus on the events Rich experienced and his faithfulness, deduced from his actions. Edwin Wooley&#x27;s letters and personal documents were more personable, and his role as financial adviser to Brigham Young made him a more fruitful subject for biography. Rebecca Cornwall wrote most of the book, and Arrington requested that she be named a co-author, but Woolley insisted that only Arrington&#x27;s name be in the book&#x27;s byline. &quot;From Quaker to Latter-day Saint: Bishop Edwin D. Woolley&quot; reflect&#x27;s Cornwall&#x27;s literary elegance and boldness in &quot;informed speculation&quot;.

Another wealthy family, the Eccles, commissioned Arrington to write a biography of David Eccles, a millionaire who helped form the industrial economy in Utah. David Eccles was a polygamist, and the descendants of his two wives, Bertha Jensen in Ogden and Ellen Stoddard in Logan, did not agree about how the biography should be written. Nora Harrison from the Logan part of the family originally commissioned the biography, but did not own enough material for the necessary research. Cleone Eccles, David&#x27;s daughter-in-law from the Ogden side of the family, wanted a biography that focused on only positive things about David Eccles, while Harrison wanted a professional, scholarly work. In order to access Cleone Eccles&#x27;s collection of David Eccles&#x27;s manuscripts, Harrison agreed to give Cleone the right to make alterations to the text. Arrington employed JoAnn Bair to do the research and first drafts of the work. Harrison was unhappy with the manuscript and paid their neighbor and writer Wallace Stegner to critique the manuscript; his 15-page guidelines advised the writer to engage the reader through cliffhangers, flashbacks, and speculation. Stegner also found the manuscript too gentle on David Eccles&#x27;s fraudulent business dealings. To appease Harrison, Arrington had Maureen Ursenbach Beecher improve the manuscript&#x27;s literary style, but the final biography still lacked real criticism of Eccles&#x27;s business practices.

Spencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington write a serious biography of Brigham Young, and Arrington paid assistants for the project out of his own pocket, possibly to insulate it from donor influences. Arrington wrote the in-depth biography with help from many of his associates at the History Division. One of Arrington&#x27;s biographers, Gary Topping, praised the research in &quot;Brigham Young: American Moses&quot;, but criticized its lack of psychological depth, missing the opportunity to re-examine the Mountain Meadows massacre and how Young&#x27;s wives were treated.

Arrington also worked on biographies for Harold Silver, Madelyn Silver, and Charles Redd, with funding from their respective families. Arrington also worked on a biography for Alice Merrill Horne.

During research on his dissertation, Arrington found a manuscript from 1946 by Feramorz Fox about Mormon communitarianism. Arrington found the manuscript fascinatingly free of Marxist thought and together with Dean L. May, revised and expanded the manuscript under the title &quot;Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation among the Mormons.&quot; Deseret Book published the book in 1976. The book was received poorly at LDS Church Headquarters; Deseret Book was not allowed to reprint the book and &quot;Church News&quot; was not permitted to review it. Fellow historians found the book well-researched but too willing to give Mormonism credit for modern welfare programs.

==Death and legacy==
Arrington remained an active and devoted member of the LDS Church throughout his life. In 1982, his wife Grace Fort died, and in 1983 Arrington was remarried to Harriett Ann Horne. On February 11, 1999 at the age of 81, Arrington died of heart failure at his home in Salt Lake City.

Starting in 1999 after his death, the MHA created the annual Leonard J. Arrington Award, awarded for distinguished and meritorious service to Mormon history. In 2002 he was posthumously awarded the first annual Lifetime Achievement Award by the John Whitmer Historical Association. In 2005, Utah State University created the Leonard J. Arrington Chair in Mormon History and Culture, which was sponsored by more than 45 donors. This chair is the first position at a public institution specifically for the study of Mormon history and culture. In Fall 2007, this chair was first filled by Philip Barlow. The university hosts the Leonard J. Arrington Mormon History Lecture Series, in which Arrington himself gave the inaugural lecture in 1995.

===The Leonard Arrington Papers===
Prior to his death, Arrington&#x27;s long history and family ties influenced his decision to donate his papers to Utah State University. After the papers opened to the public in October 2001, a small group of Church Historical Department staff began reading through the collection for over three weeks. Thereafter, a law firm (Kirton and McConkie) hired by the Church Historical Department claimed the church owned up to 60% of the materials in the Arrington Papers due to their relevance to Arrington&#x27;s tenure as Church Historian, which would have been approximately 400,000 of the 700,000 items in the collection. Kirton and McConkie issued an injunction against using the Arrington Papers&#x27; use, and in early November 2001 a lawsuit seemed possible. However, Gordon B. Hinckley, church president, shifted the interaction toward negotiation when he called USU president Kermit Hall and assured him the church would issue no lawsuits. During the course of negotiations, the church revised its request to about 200,000 items. However, USU archivists believed the church could claim ownership only over the Council of Twelve minutes in the papers, less than one-half of one-percent of the total collection.

The church eventually agreed to accepting that amount when it came out during the course of negotiations that church staff had read portions of Arrington&#x27;s diary. In addition to giving the originals of his diaries to USU, Arrington had given microfilm of his diary from his boyhood until 1982 to the Church Archives, but with the condition that his diaries not be read until 25 years after his death. However, shortly after Arrington&#x27;s death, a general authority asked Arrington&#x27;s daughter, Susan Madsen, to excise 40 entries from her father&#x27;s diary; Arrington&#x27;s family concluded church staff had read his journals before the request time had elapsed and without proper permission. George Daines, the Arrington family attorney, explained that the family had grounds to take legal action against the LDS Church, and the negotiations soon ended with the church accepting the Arrington family&#x27;s terms. Arrington&#x27;s family agreed to give the LDS Church some of the materials, including minutes to meetings with the Twelve Apostles and materials related to the temple ceremony. As for the 40 diary entries, the church dropped the request after an unnamed apostle read the chosen entries and concluded they were unproblematic.

Before his passing, Arrington&#x27;s children convinced their father to decrease the amount of time before making his diaries available from 25 years to 10 years. The diaries were made available in September 2010 at Utah State University. Arrington&#x27;s collection of papers at Utah State&#x27;s Merrill-Crazier Library adds up to 319 linear feet. It has been regarded as &quot;one of the most important archival sources on twentieth-century Mormon history.&quot;

<text>The Aurignacian () is an archaeological industry of the Upper Paleolithic associated with Early European modern humans (EEMH) lasting from 43,000 to 26,000 years ago. The Upper Paleolithic developed in Europe some time after the Levant, where the Emiran period and the Ahmarian period form the first periods of the Upper Paleolithic, corresponding to the first stages of the expansion of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; out of Africa. They then migrated to Europe and created the first European culture of modern humans, the Aurignacian.

The Proto-Aurignacian and the Early Aurignacian stages are dated between about 43,000 and 37,000 years ago. The Aurignacian proper lasted from about 37,000 to 33,000 years ago. A Late Aurignacian phase transitional with the Gravettian dates to about 33,000 to 26,000 years ago.
The type site is the Cave of Aurignac, Haute-Garonne, south-west France. The main preceding period is the Mousterian of the Neanderthals.

One of the oldest examples of figurative art, the Venus of Hohle Fels, comes from the Aurignacian or Proto-Gravettian and is dated to between 40,000 and 35,000 years ago (though now earlier figurative art may be known, see Lubang Jeriji Saléh). It was discovered in September 2008 in a cave at Schelklingen in Baden-Württemberg in western Germany. The German Lion-man figure is given a similar date range.

A &quot;Levantine Aurignacian&quot; culture is known from the Levant, with a type of blade technology very similar to the European Aurignacian, following chronologically the Emiran and Early Ahmarian in the same area of the Near East, and also closely related to them. The Levantine Aurignacian may have preceded European Aurignacian, but there is a possibility that the Levantine Aurignacian was rather the result of reverse influence from the European Aurignacian: this remains unsettled.

==Main characteristics==
The Aurignacians are part of the wave of anatomically modern humans thought to have spread from Africa through the Near East into Paleolithic Europe, and became known as European early modern humans, or Cro-Magnons. This wave of anatomically modern humans includes fossils of the Ahmarian, Bohunician, Aurignacian, Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian cultures, extending throughout the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), covering the period of roughly 48,000 to 15,000 years ago. In terms of population, the Aurignacian cultural complex is chronologically associated with the human remains of Goyet Q116-1, while the subsequent eastern Gravettian is associated with the Vestonice cluster.

The Aurignacian tool industry is characterized by worked bone or antler points with grooves cut in the bottom. Their flint tools include fine blades and bladelets struck from prepared cores rather than using crude flakes. The people of this culture also produced some of the earliest known cave art, such as the animal engravings at Trois Freres and the paintings at Chauvet cave in southern France. They also made pendants, bracelets, and ivory beads, as well as three-dimensional figurines. Perforated rods, thought to be spear throwers or shaft wrenches, also are found at their sites.

==Art==
Aurignacian figurines have been found depicting faunal representations of the time period associated with now-extinct mammals, including mammoths, rhinoceros, and tarpan, along with anthropomorphized depictions that may be interpreted as some of the earliest evidence of religion.

Many 35,000-year-old animal figurines were discovered in the Vogelherd Cave in Germany. One of the horses, amongst six tiny mammoth and horse ivory figures found previously at Vogelherd, was sculpted as skillfully as any piece found throughout the Upper Paleolithic. The production of ivory beads for body ornamentation was also important during the Aurignacian. The famous paintings in Chauvet cave date from this period.

Typical statuettes consist of women that are called Venus figurines. They emphasize the hips, breasts, and other body parts associated with fertility. Feet and arms are lacking or minimized. One of the most ancient figurines is the Venus of Hohle Fels, discovered in 2008 in the Hohle Fels cave in Germany. The figurine has been dated to 35,000 years ago and is the earliest known, undisputed example of a depiction of a human being in prehistoric art. The Lion-man of Hohlenstein-Stadel, found in the Hohlenstein-Stadel cave of Germany&#x27;s Swabian Alb and dated to 40,000 years ago, is the oldest known anthropomorphic animal figurine in the world.

Aurignacian finds include bone flutes. The oldest undisputed musical instrument was the Hohle Fels Flute discovered in the Hohle Fels cave in Germany&#x27;s Swabian Alb in 2008. The flute is made from a vulture&#x27;s wing bone perforated with five finger holes, and dates to approximately 35,000-40,000 years ago. A flute was also found at the Abri Blanchard in southwestern France.

==Tools==

Stone tools from the Aurignacian culture are known as Mode 4, characterized by blades (rather than flakes, typical of mode 2 Acheulean and mode 3 Mousterian) from prepared cores. Also seen throughout the Upper Paleolithic is a greater degree of tool standardization and the use of bone and antler for tools. Based on the research of scraper reduction and paleoenvironment, the early Aurignacian group moved seasonally over greater distances to procure reindeer herds within cold and open environments than those of the earlier tool cultures.


==Population==
A 2019 demographic analysis estimated a mean population of 1,500 persons (upper limit: 3,300; lower limit: 800) for western and central Europe during the Aurignacian period (~42,000 to 33,000 y cal BP).

A 2005 study estimated the population of Upper Palaeolithic Europe from 40–30 thousand years ago was 1,738–28,359 (average 4,424).

==Association with modern humans==

The sophistication and self-awareness demonstrated in the work led archaeologists to consider the makers of Aurignacian artifacts the first modern humans in Europe. Human remains and Late Aurignacian artifacts found in juxtaposition support this inference. Although finds of human skeletal remains in direct association with Proto-Aurignacian technologies are scarce in Europe, the few available are also probably modern human. The best dated association between Aurignacian industries and human remains are those of at least five individuals from the Mladeč caves in the Czech Republic, dated by direct radiocarbon measurements of the skeletal remains to at least 31,000–32,000 years old.

At least three robust, but typically anatomically-modern, individuals from the Peștera cu Oase cave in Romania, were dated directly from the bones to ca. 35,000–36,000 BP. Although not associated directly with archaeological material, these finds are within the chronological and geographical range of the Early Aurignacian in southeastern Europe. On genetic evidence it has been argued that both Aurignacian and the Dabba culture of North Africa came from an earlier big game hunting Levantine Aurignacian culture of the Levant.

==Genetics==

In a genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2016, the remains of an early Aurignacian individual, Goyet Q116-1 from modern-day Belgium, were examined. He belonged to the paternal haplogroup C1a and the maternal haplogroup M. Haplogroups identified in other Aurignacian samples are the paternal haplogroups C1b and K2a; and mt-DNA haplogroup N, R, and U.

The Aurignacian material culture is associated with the expansion of &#x27;early West Eurasians&#x27; during the Upper-Paleolithic, replacing or merging with previous Initial Upper Paleolithic cultures to which possibly relates the European Châtelperronian.

A 2023 study found that the Aurignacians are closely related to the Gravettians, Solutreans and Magdalenians. Gravettian-producing peoples belonged to two genetically distinct clusters. Fournol in the west (France and Spain) and Věstonice in the east (Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, and Italy), both tracing their descent from producers of the earlier Aurignacian culture. The genes of seven Magdalenians, the El Miron Cluster in Iberia, showed a close relationship to the Aurignacian population that lived in northern Europe some 20,000 years earlier. The analyses suggested that 70-80% of the ancestry of these individuals was from the population represented by Goyet Q116-1, associated with the Aurignacian culture.

<text>The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology is a committee of the United States House of Representatives. It has jurisdiction over non-defense federal scientific research and development. More specifically, the committee has complete jurisdiction over the following federal agencies: NASA, NSF, NIST, and the OSTP. The committee also has authority over R&amp;D activities at the Department of Energy, the EPA, FAA, NOAA, the DOT, the NWS, the DHS and the U.S. Fire Administration.

== History ==
In the wake of the Soviet Sputnik program in the late 1950s, Congress created the Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration on 05 March 1958, chaired by majority leader John William McCormack. This select committee drafted the National Aeronautics and Space Act that created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). A staff report of the committee, the &quot;Space Handbook: Astronautics and its Applications&quot;, provided non-technical information about spaceflight to U.S. policy makers.

The committee also chartered the permanent House Committee on Science and Astronautics, which officially began on January 3, 1959, and was the first new standing committee established in the House since 1946. The name was changed in 1974 to the House Committee on Science and Technology. The name was changed again in 1987 to the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. After the Republican Party gained a majority in Congress in 1994, the name of the committee was changed to the House Committee on Science. With the return of control to the Democrats in 2007, the committee&#x27;s name was changed back to the House Committee on Science and Technology.

During the 112th Congress, which was in session from 2011-2013, Committee Chairman Ralph Hall added &quot;Space&quot; back into the committee&#x27;s name: &quot;The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology&quot; – a nod to the committee&#x27;s history, broad jurisdiction, and the importance of space exploration in maintaining American innovation and competitiveness.

<doc id="659137" wikidata="Q951004" url="?curid=659137" title="Ferrari 612 Scaglietti">
<text>The Ferrari 612 Scaglietti (Type F137) () is an executive 2+2 coupé grand tourer made by the Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari between 2004 and 2011. It was designed to replace the smaller 456; its larger size makes it a true 4-seater with adequate space in the rear seats for adults.

The design, especially the large side scallops and the headlights, pays homage to the 375 MM built in 1954, which director Roberto Rossellini commissioned for his wife, Ingrid Bergman.
== Chassis ==
The 612 is Ferrari&#x27;s second all-aluminium vehicle, the first being the 360 Modena. Its space frame, manufactured in collaboration with Alcoa, is made from extrusions and castings of the material, and the aluminium body is then welded on. The chassis of the 612 formed the basis of the 599 GTB flagship grand tourer.

== Engine ==
The 612 Scaglietti shares its engine with the 575 Superamerica - despite the name&#x27;s suggestion that it is a six-litre V12 the displacement is actually . The engine has a compression ratio of 11:1 and enables the car to attain a top speed of and allows it to accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 4 seconds. 

== Transmissions ==

Two choices of transmissions were available on the 612, a 6-speed manual or the 6-speed automated manual paddle shift transmission designated the &quot;F1A&quot;, a much refined version of the F1 transmission used in the 360. The gearbox is built by Graziano Trasmissioni. Reportedly, only 199 cars were built with the manual transmission, of which 60 were destined for US market.

==Variants==

===612 HGT-S and 612 HGT-C===

There is not much public knowledge about the 612, but from 2006 the &quot;pre-OTO&quot; versions could be specced with the Handling Gran Turismo Sport or Handling Gran Turismo Competizione packages. They include new calibration settings for the shock absorbers and the gearbox that was 150ms faster as a result (the gearbox had a mode called F1-S instead of the auto mode). The package also includes polished exhaust grilles. Both packages were coming with the factory sport exhaust to produce a more marked and thrilling sound. The packages also included specific 19 inches modular wheels that were polished on the HGT-C package and painted brake calipers. The only difference between HGT-S and HGT-C is the addition of carbon ceramic brakes on the latter. 

==Production==
The body of the 612 was produced at Ferrari&#x27;s Carrozzeria Scaglietti plant, the former home of the car&#x27;s namesake coachbuilder in Modena, Italy. It was then taken to the Ferrari factory located at Maranello and the V12 engine along with the interior were installed. A total of 3,025 cars were produced, with only 199 equipped with a manual gearbox.

In 2007 Ferrari announced the availability of the SuperFast robotic (F1) gearbox and a new electro-chromatic glass roof that could tint and lighten at the push of a button for the 612. In early 2008, at the Geneva Car Show, Ferrari unveiled the One-To-One (OTO) personalization program and thereafter the 612 was only available through this special-order process. The OTO program took the catalog of options under the existing Carrozzeria Scaglietti Programme a step further. Clients hand-picked a wide variety of options from leather swatches to brake calipers and everything in between. Although the OTO program was launched on the 612 Scaglietti, it was broadened to the entire Ferrari range in due course. 

The Ferrari 612 was replaced by the Ferrari FF in 2011.

==Recall==
In 2008, Ferrari recalled several hundred 2005–2007 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti equipped with the automated manual &quot;F1&quot; transmission because the clutch sensor in the transmission could malfunction due to heat from the vehicle under normal operating conditions. This would render the vehicle inoperable and possibly result in a crash.

In August 2022, another recall was announced, affecting around 23,000 road cars including the Ferrari 612 Scaglietti. This was due to a problem with the brake fluid reservoir cap &quot;where it fails to vent properly, creating a vacuum in the reservoir which can cause brake fluid to leak. If enough fluid leaks, the car could lose partial or complete braking ability, which is dangerous for the driver.&quot; The remedy stated involves &quot;replacing the reservoir cap with a modified version that should vent properly, as well as installing software to provide an alternate warning should brake fluid levels still reach dangerous levels. Dealers and owners will be notified on September 24.&quot;

==Special models and one-offs==

===612 Sessanta (2007)===

The 612 Sessanta (Italian for &quot;sixty&quot;) is a limited (60 unit) variant of the 612 commemorating the 60th anniversary of the company. Standard equipment included 19-inch forged aluminium wheels, black chrome exhaust tips, the automated manual F1 transmission, three-position electrochromic glass roof, start/stop ignition button on the steering wheel, Bose infotainment system and a two-tone paint.

===612 Pebble Beach Bicolore (2006)===

One-off two-tone 612 Scaglietti special produced which would go on to influence one of the two colors of Sessanta models offered the following year (along with its sister car the 2006 Detroit Motor Show car). With its distinctive Nero and Silver paint scheme, the 612 Pebble Beach was displayed August 2005 at a private event during Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance. Press articles in 2006 referred to this as the &quot;Ferrari 612 Pebble Beach&quot;.

===Cornes 30th Anniversary Edition (2006)===

Unveiled June 2006 in Japan, the Cornes 30th Anniversary Edition is a limited (20 unit) variant for the Japanese market commemorating the 30th anniversary of Cornes &amp; Co. importing Ferrari automobiles into Japan. Standard equipment included the HGTC package, Blu Cornes paint scheme, a carbon fibre filler cap, and mesh grille inserts in the front and rear fascias.

It had an MSRP of 33,980,000 Yen ($304,000 USD).

=== 612 GP Berne Edition (2006) ===

Unveiled at Montreux Grand Prix Switzerland on July 22, 2006, the 612 GP program was in celebration of Ferrari&#x27;s 40th anniversary in Switzerland and the anniversary of their first Swiss Grand Prix in 1949. The dark grey car - of which 9 were built - featured the HGTC handling package (including carbon-ceramic brakes) bi-colour paint treatment with the 612 Scaglietti&#x27;s side &quot;scallops&quot; finished in a silver-grey color and color-coded brake calipers. The interior was finished in red with grey trim. The lower dashboard, seat front sections, central tunnel sides, door panels, and lower half of the sports steering wheel all finished in red. A special plaque, imprinted with an outline of the historic Berne track, is mounted on the dash.

It had an MSRP of CHF425,000.

===612 Kappa (2006)===
The 612 Kappa is a one-off special built by Pininfarina for Peter S. Kalikow, former chairman of the New York Metropolitan Transport Authority, and a renowned Ferrari collector, and unveiled at the Villa d&#x27;Este Concours d&#x27;Elegance on April 23, 2006. The Kappa stands out from the standard 612 through the use of multiple unique elements, such as a functional hood scoop on the engine cover lined with polished aluminium, added air vents near the front wheels for improved downforce, the rear taillights found on the Ferrari Enzo along with the F430, personalised door handles containing the initials of the owner, chromed headlight bezels, and a sunroof that utilises electrochromic glass to vary the amount of opacity in the glass. On the request of Kalikow, Ferrari agreed to not copy the distinguished elements of the 612 Kappa into its future models.

===GG50 (2005)===
The Ferrari GG50 is a concept car developed by Italian styling house Italdesign Giugiaro, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Giorgetto Giugiaro as an automobile designer. Based on the 612 Scaglietti, the car was designed by Giugiaro himself and has a fastback coupé body style with a shorter wheelbase than the donor car. The car features folding back seats and a tailgate in order for easy entry and exit of the passengers. The folding back seats also result in increased storage space. The roofline has been designed in a downsloping manner, resulting in more headroom for passengers in the rear seats. Apart from that, the car features a redesigned nose, unique wheels, a glass roof, front air vents near the front wheels for increased downforce and improved brake cooling, thinner headlamps and unique quad tail lamps. Giugiaro wanted a Ferrari that he could easily use with his family and which allowed easy entry and exit of passengers from the rear of the car. The mechanical components are the same as those found in a standard 612.

The car was unveiled at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show. Ferrari provided a rolling chassis of the 612 Scaglietti and technical support to Italdesign during the build process.

<doc id="659150" wikidata="Q697557" url="?curid=659150" title="Meidling">
<text>Meidling () is the 12th district of Vienna (). It is located just southwest of the central districts, south of the River Wien, west of the Gürtel belt, and east and southeast of Schönbrunn Palace. Meidling is a heavily populated urban area with many residential buildings, but also large recreational areas and parks.

In sports, it is represented by the FC Dynamo Meidling. Former Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz was born and raised in Meidling and his private residence is there.

==Geography==

===Location===
The 12th District lies in southwest Vienna, about 5–10 km (3–6 mi) from the Innere Stadt. It stretches from Wiental south of the River Wien in the region between the Wienerberg hill in the 10th District and the Grünen Berg hill, part of Schönbrunn Palace, in the 13th District.
===District parts===
The former suburb, after which the &quot;Meidlinger L&quot; of the South-Vienna dialect is named, consists of two parts:
* a heavily developed workers section, closer to the downtown area (Obermeidling, Untermeidling and Gaudenzdorf);
* and a loose joint area (and Altmannsdorf Hetzendorf), to the southwest. The latter is a mixed industrial and residential area to the Valley of the Liesing, where the compound structure of the 23rd District continues. In between, are the foothills of the mountain with its Viennese geologically young beach terraces and brick pits.

Besides the &quot;Katastralgemeinden&quot; of Altmannsdorf, Gaudenzdorf, Hetzendorf and Meidling (Obermeidling and Untermeidling), there are also small areas of the &quot;Katastralgemeinden&quot; Atzgersdorf, Inzersdorf and Inzersdorf City in the Meidlinger district area.
A breakdown of the district area is also in the Zählbezirken official statistics, in which the municipality Zählsprengel combined. The eleven census-districts in Meidling are: Gaudenzdorf, Fuchsenfeld, Meidlinger Friedhof, Wilhelmsdorf, Meidlinger Hauptstraße, Tivoligasse, Gatterhölzl, Oswaldgasse, Am Schöpfwerk, Altmannsdorf und Hetzendorf. Despite partial name similarity, the boundaries of the census-districts do not match those of each Katastralgemeinde.
===Land use===
The developed area of Meidling includes 54.3% (33.3% Vienna-wide) of the area of the district. The space itself is distributed as 69.0% to 9.7%, for residential areas versus total area of cultural, religious, or sports venues (devoted to public purposes). This relatively high figure is compared to one for a Viennese township as a very low proportion of farmland (4.3% of the area to be developed).

Greenspace in Hietzing takes in a share of 18.2%. 
The proportion of traffic areas in the district region is, with 27.5%, typical for central Vienna.

==History==

Meidling, as a district of Vienna, was founded in 1892. It consists of five former villages: Obermeidling, Untermeidling, Gaudenzdorf, Hetzendorf and Altmannsdorf. Obermeidling and Untermeidling were one village called Meidling until 1806, when they were divided. Altmannsdorf still has its rural character.

The place Altmannsdorf was mentioned for the first time in 1314 and had a rural character for a long time. In 1190 was the first written mention of Hetzendorf, after which Henricus von Hetzendorf received it as a feudal village. Later, it came into possession of the Klosterneuburg Abbey and the German Knights Order. In the 18th century, the site developed into a residential colony.
The settlement at Meidling had been documented under the name &quot;Murlingen&quot; since the year 1104. Originally, the area belonged as a large part of the Klosterneuburg Abbey. In the Middle Ages, mainly farms and vineyards were operated in Meidling.

In 1755, a sulphurous source was discovered, whereupon the area and Theresienbad became a popular destination for the Viennese. At the end of the 18th century, more and more industry established itself, changing the character of the place totally. This led in 1806, to the division of the community, already quite large, into Obermeidling (upper) and Untermeidling (lower). In Untermeidling, a separate settlement developed on the former brickworks site, which was detached in 1846 under the name Wilhelmsdorf. In 1819, the suburb Gaudenzdorf had emerged along the current Vienna Belt, in which, because of the situation in Vienna, numerous dyers, tanners and launderers settled.

On 1 January 1892, all these communities were united to the 12th Viennese community district, Meidling. As a consequence, it became a typical worker district. In the area of the Vienna Belt, many community buildings emerged in the 1920s. The zones of Hetzendorf and Altmannsdorf remained rurally stamped to be sure, but expanded dwelling plants emerged there also, after the Second World War.

==Population==
In 1869, the current area covered by the Meidling district consisted of only about 31,000 inhabitants. By the 1892 incorporation, the population had already doubled, through the continuous influx of people to Vienna and the surrounding community. The population growth continued until the beginning of the Great War, so the district, in 1910, contained 106.531 inhabitants. After a slight decline after the First World War, the district reached 109,538 inhabitants in 1934, as its highest population. As a result, the population figures stabilized, after a brief recovery during the 1960s, in the 1980s at a value of just under 80,000 inhabitants. Only after the turn of the millennium, did the district population in Vienna citywide trend to grow. At the beginning of 2007, the population stood at 85,099 people.

===Population structure===
The age of the population of Meidlinger in 2001, compared to Vienna citywide, was roughly average. The percentage of children under 15 years was 14.8% in the total area (Vienna: 14.7%). Also, the percentage of the population from 15 to 59 years stood at 63.0% (Vienna: 63.6%), in the average range. The number of people aged 60 or more, in 2007, was 18,662 or 21.7% (Vienna: 21.7%). The gender distribution in the district area was 47.9% men and 52.1% women.
The number of Meidlingers married was a share of 40.7%, compared to Vienna&#x27;s 41.2%, only slightly below the average of Vienna.

===Origin and language===
The proportion of foreign district residents in 2005 was 20.2% (Vienna: 18.7%), and points to 2001 (16.5%) as in the entire state a rising trend. The highest proportion of foreigners in 2005 represented approximately 5.7% share of the district population nationals from Serbia and Montenegro. Other 3.1% were Turkish, Bosnian 1.5%, 1.4% Somali and 1.2% Croatian citizens. 24.4% of the population of Meidling in 2001 weren&#x27;t born in Austria. 7.7% of the inhabitants could speak Serbian, 5.9% Turkish and 2.7% Croatian. [7] [8]

===Religious preferences===
The religion of the population in the Meidling district in 2001 largely on average, of Vienna, although the proportion of residents with the Roman Catholic confession with just under 47.0% above the community average of 49.2% was. There are eight in the municipality of Roman Catholic parishes, the city Deanery 12 images. On the other hand, the proportion of people with Islamic beliefs with 9.5% and the proportion of population with Orthodox confession with 7.2% above the average. The percentage of Protestant believers stood at 4.1%, 25.8% belonged to any religious community. Other 6.4% had no religion or another confession given, [7]

==Politics==
As a working-class district, Meidling is politically traditionally dominated by the SPÖ, which has determined the governor of the district since 1946. Often the SPÖ in Meidling has also reached the absolute majority of votes. The ÖVP were the second strongest party in Meidling from 1946 until 1991, when the FPÖ became the second most popular party. In 1996, after a gain of 8.5%, the FPÖ won the majority of votes from the SPÖ. However, the FPÖ lost all of their gains at the elections in 2001, and even fell below the results of 1991. This decline continued in 2005, although to a lesser extent. The FPÖ barely received more votes than the ÖVP, and the FPÖ slid to a 15.5% vote share. The SPÖ in 2005 regained the absolute majority of votes. The Greens, who became increasingly popular from 1991 to 2005, were by 2005 only just behind the FPÖ and ÖVP. 
==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the Meidling district consists of five parts. The heart sign in the center represents the district-part of Untermeidling. It shows the growing waves nymph with silver, blue decorated cans. It would therefore emphasize the importance of the Vienna River and the springs out of the area. Below is a rectangular, Roman altar stone, the 1853 has been found. The upper left part shows the coat of arms of St. John of Nepomuk, the patron saint of the parish church as represents the district part Gaudenzdorf. He faces a silvery blue bridge on foot. Since John Nepomuk is the patron saint against floods, he serves as a reminder of the historical threat to the area from the River Wien. The right upper part of coat of arms is part of the district Hetzendorf and shows the cross of the Teutonic Order. This was the basic rule of the territory from 1456 inne. The lower left part of the coat of arms is part of the district Obermeidling. It shows in the upper part of a golden wheel as a symbol of the former mills situated here. Below is a green hill with the symbol of the Crescent and a golden star for the six former importance of viticulture. The lower right part is finally Crest for the District of part Altmannsdorf. It shows a black raven with a golden ring in its beak. This represents the King Oswald of Northumbria, the patron saint of parish Altmannsdorfer. The coat of arms of Altmannsdorf can also be found at the house Khleslplatz 2, but this coat of arms has been weathered.

==Dialect==
The &quot;Meidlinger L&quot; is a specialty of the German working-class dialect spoken in Vienna (see Viennese German). It refers to the letter &quot;l&quot; spoken as &quot;dl&quot; (as in Meidling, hence the name) in some variants of the Viennese dialect. Some believe that this feature of the dialect has its origin in Czech, where the &#x27;l&#x27; sometimes sounds similar, e.g. in the past tense.

From the original cemetery, only the tombstone of the composer Joseph Haydn remains. Approximately half the size is the Wilhelmsdorf park, which was named for its lake at Deckergasse and Deckerpark.

Back in 1909 there was a small public green space, according to the resolution of a stock of rail lines around 1980 Vienna expanded and 1990 has been redesigned. Nearby is the roughly the same size stone farm park, between the Längenfeldgasse Malfattigasse and the lies and 2003 after the establishment of the People&#x27;s garage was reopened. A similarly large area includes the city Gaudenzdorfergürtel Wilderness, a ruderal belt between the Vienna and the left Wienzeile.

At the district on the border with Hietzing Green Mountain is the Marillenalm, a natural, largely wooded park, which also includes fruit trees. Smaller parks are: Theresienbad (Theresienbadpark und Christine-Busta-Park) and at the Arnethstraße (Hermann-Leopoldi-Park). The Hermann-Leopoldi-Park provides a universal-ball playground, a volleyball court with sand, a playground, and a Mediterranean bowling (&quot;Boccia&quot;) area.

With the merger of the district area of several communities, in Meidling there are still more of the original local cemeteries.

The club has won a championship and 1947 Cup Final; however, in 1973 it was merged with the club for FC Admira Wacker / Admira.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Education===
Castle Hetzendorf houses a fashion school of the City of Vienna.

There are two &quot;gymnasiums&quot; (secondary schools) in Meidling, both of them in Untermeidling: the GRG 12 Rosa Street and the GRG 12 Erlgasse. The GRG 12 Rosa Street opened in 1883. It is where Ignaz Seipel, a former Chancellor of Austria, took his Matura exams. In 1895, the Burgtheater director Friedrich Schreyvogl and 1942 Ernst Wimmer and Gerhard Fritsch, maturierten writer, and one of Europe&#x27;s largest Tesla plants. The GRG 12 Erlgasse has been there since the 1950s.

Besides them, there is the GRG Singrienergasse 19–21 in Meidling; middle, this school moved to Inzersdorf at Draschestraße is known as GRG 23 VBS.

===Transport===

The 12th District is connected by two subway lines (U4, U6), the S-Bahn trunk route, a tram (62) and the Badner Bahn. The trams 6 and 18 driving while already on the Margaretner side of the belt are related to access to Meidling. The south train leads though Meidling, whose rail station, Vienna Meidling, is Austria&#x27;s most frequented train station. Moreover, the Pottendorfer line of the south train branches off there. The Danube country train crosses the 12th district, yet the stops for Hetzendorf und Altmannsdorf are no longer in operation, which is why the passenger service does not serve on the Danube country train the local traffic in the 12th District.

===Railways===
Wien Meidling railway station, located on the Southern railway, is one of the largest railway stations in Vienna. It is located in Untermeidling. All trains from Vienna to Wiener Neustadt, Graz and Klagenfurt stop there.

<doc id="659152" wikidata="Q5055196" url="?curid=659152" title="Cavolinioidea">
<text>The superfamily Cavolinioidea is the most speciose group of sea butterflies. They belong to the suborder Euthecosomata. 

Sea butterflies (thecosomata) are pelagic marine gastropods, so called because they swim by flapping their wing-like parapodia.

==Distribution==
These sea butterflies are circumglobal, carried by the sea currents to all the seas of the world.

== Habitat ==
Cavoliniids prefer deep waters, from 100 m up to 2,000 m. They do best in warm oceanic water.

== Shell description ==
Species in this superfamily have a calcareous, bilaterally symmetrical conical or globular shell. Identification of juveniles is difficult as the juvenile shells differ greatly from adults.

==Life habits==
Towards the anterior end of the animal, two parapodia (winglike flat lobules) protrude between each half of the shell. The parapodia enable these sea butterflies to float along in the water currents, using slow flapping movements. The parapodia are also covered with cilia, which produce a minute water current that pushes the planktonic food to the mouth of the animal.

== Reproduction ==
Cavoliniids have a strange sexual life. They develop from males as juveniles into hermaphrodites and then later convert into females. More than one male stage can occur. This bizarre-seeming, but not very uncommon phenomenon is called protandry. (This is also common among many species of fish, some may all start as females, others species may start as males.)

==Taxonomy==
In 2003, the family Cavoliniidae was raised to the rank of superfamily Cavolinioidea. At the same time, the subfamilies were given the new status of families: Cavoliniidae, Cliidae, Creseidae and Cuvierinidae (&quot;Cainozoic Research&quot;, 2(1-2): 163-170, 2003).

=== 2005 taxonomy ===
In the taxonomy of Bouchet &amp; Rocroi (2005) several families have been categorized as subfamilies of the family Cavoliniidae and the superfamily Cavolinioidea is treated like this:

* Family Cavoliniidae 
**Subfamily Cavoliinae - formerly Hyalaeidae Rafinesque, 1815
* Family Cliidae - formerly Cleodoridae Gray, 1840 - nomen oblitum
* Family Creseidae - formerly subfamily Creseinae Curry, 1982
* Family Cuvierinidae - formerly subfamily Cuvierininae van der Spoel, 1967
* † Family Sphaerocinidae 

In 2005 a new family Praecuvierinidae was created on evolutionary grounds.

In 2020 a new family Hyalocylidae was added. 

;Families brought into synonymy:
* Cleodoridae : synonym of Cavoliniidae 
* Clioidae : synonym of Cliidae (incorrect subsequent spelling)
* Hyalaeidae : synonym of Cavoliniidae 
* Tripteridae : synonym of Cliidae

<doc id="659156" wikidata="Q641183" url="?curid=659156" title="Battle of Kock (1939)">
<text>The Battle of Kock was the final battle in the invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II in Europe. It took place between 2–5 October 1939, near the town of Kock, in Poland.

The Polish Independent Operational Group Polesie, led by General Franciszek Kleeberg, fought the German XIV Motorized Corps, led by General Gustav Anton von Wietersheim.

==Before the battle==
The Polish battle plan was disorganized due to few officers being available. The Wehrmacht had destroyed the Polish reserve and forced it to withdraw. Having taken heavy losses, the Polish armies retreated to Kraków and the Vistula river. From there, they took the route from Warsaw to Sandomierz. From Sandomierz, they were able to move on to the Lublin area.

The eastern edge of the Vistula was defended by Lublin&#x27;s weak army. The Polish forces were only camped in areas where they could cross the river easily (in case of an attack). Other German forces advanced to the Vistula and went on towards Zamość and Volodymyr-Volynskyi.

The Polish Army at Kraków and Małopolska suffered heavy losses, and did not reach the San river front. Therefore, they were unable to organize a proper defense. Marshal Rydz Śmigły was tasked with the defense of southern Poland. The commander of army area IX Brześć, General Kleeberg, was responsible for the defense of the line from Pińsk to Brześć.

==Group organization==
On 8 September, General Kleeberg received orders from Marshal Rydz-Śmigły to organize a division of infantry from the depot division (a depot was where reserve soldiers and recruits were trained). General Kleeberg was also ordered to organize a defensive line from Brześć to Pińsk. While his forces were well-trained, they lacked heavy equipment as it had previously been dispatched to the front-line divisions.

==Battle of Brześć Litewski and Kobryń==

After breaking through the Polish line in the Battle of Wizna, the German XIX Army Corps under General Heinz Guderian started its rapid advance south. The corps, composed of the 3rd Panzer Division, the 10th Panzer Division, the 20th Motorized Infantry Division, with the 2nd Motorized Division in reserve, was ordered to capture the old fortress in Brześć Litewski and then strike further southwards towards Kowel and Galicia. The purpose of this attack was to cut Poland in two and paralyze the defenses east of the Bug River.

Initially, Guderian&#x27;s forces advanced almost unopposed. However, on 14 September, they were stopped in the area of Brześć Fortress and Kobryn by a four-battalion-strong improvised force under General Konstanty Plisowski. In the three-day-long battle, which became known as the Battle of Brześć Litewski, both sides suffered significant casualties. Although the Poles finally withdrew from the area on 17 September, the Germans did not start the pursuit soon enough to rout the retreating Poles. The simultaneous attack on Kobryn, which is sometimes referred to as the Battle of Kobryń, was inconclusive, with the Polish improvised &#x27;Kobryń&#x27; Infantry Division under Colonel Adam Epler withdrawing unopposed.

Both Polish units from Kobryń and Brześć were soon joined by the Podlaska Cavalry Brigade. The unit, commanded by General Ludwik Kmicic-Skrzyński, successfully evaded encirclement by withdrawing through the Białowieża Forest. General Kmicic-Skrzyński, with his chief of staff, Major Julian Szychiewicz, went to Vawkavysk where he made telephone contact with General Kleeberg. The two agreed to join their forces and move southwards, towards the Romanian Bridgehead.

The 16th Motorized Infantry Regiment with artillery and Luftwaffe support, began an attack on the positions of the 83rd Polish Infantry Regiment on 18 September, capturing a number of Polish positions. The Polish counter-attack, which began at 17.00 hours, regained some territory. General Kleeberg began withdrawing his forces to Romania and Hungary. Over the next two days Polish forces were ordered to concentrate north of Kowel. While on the march, a formation of the Polesie Group was attacked by fifth columnists and from the air, but loose groups of Polish soldiers joined the group.

After a battle with Red Army forces, General Kleeberg decided to march to the relief of Warsaw on 22 September. He first planned to capture crossing places on the Bug River. The concentration area would be near Włodawa. Formations, organized by Colonel Brzoza-Brzezina, fought only against the Germans. They could fight the Red Army but only if they, the Poles, were attacked first. Between 22 and 25 September, elements of the Polesie Group were attacked by German aircraft during the march to Włodawa. On the last day of these attacks, General Kleeberg received information that Włodawa had been captured by unknown Polish units. Most personnel were soldiers from destroyed Polish formations who had not been caught by the Germans and were looking for commanders and formations which still fought. His staff began organizing the defense of a bridgehead in Włodawa.

Elsewhere, between 17 and 26 September, formations of the Polesie Group crossed the Bug river and entered an area near Włodawa. After receiving information about the surrender of Warsaw, General Kleeberg asked his commanders their opinion after informing them of the political and military situation. He also asked General Zygmunt Podhorski, the commander of the &#x27;Zaza&#x27; cavalry division (comprising two brigades of cavalry [&#x27;Pils&#x27; and &#x27;Edward&#x27;], two infantry battalions [&#x27;Olek&#x27; and &#x27;Wilk&#x27;] and divisional artillery), to join him. General Podhorski agreed but then decided that he would first go to Stawy near Dęblin, the location of the main arsenal of the Polish army. They would then move to the Holy Cross Mountains and engage in guerrilla warfare.

Kleeberg decided to re-organize his command. The &#x27;Kobryń&#x27; division would get little in the way of re-supply but would be renamed the 60th Infantry Division. The &#x27;Brzoza&#x27; and &#x27;Drohiczyn&#x27; groups would be merged – Colonel Brzoza-Brzezina would command the resultant 50th Infantry Division with three infantry regiments and a division of artillery. The 60th Infantry Division would be commanded by Colonel Adam Epler, comprising: three infantry regiments, a division of artillery, a motorized company of 37 mm anti-tank guns, four independent and seven independent formations. In all, Kleeberg had some 18,000 men.

On 28 September, the Polish forces began to march south to the Parczew-Wojcieszków line with the &#x27;Zaza&#x27; cavalry division securing the march. One of the Uhlan regiments from the &#x27;Edward&#x27; brigade successfully crossed the Wieprz river and captured Spiczyn; another cavalry regiment from the &#x27;Zaza&#x27; Division captured Jawidz and Wymysłów after some resistance. The Germans suffered heavy losses. The next day there was more fighting between the &#x27;Zaza&#x27; Division and the Germans near Spiczyn. That evening, the 60th Infantry Division made contact with the Germans and entered a forest near Czeremniki. The Germans, using a formation of infantry and supported by two tanks, attacked the 1st Battalion, 182nd Infantry Regiment unsuccessfully.

By 30 September, Polish forces were situated between the rivers Tyśmienica and Wieprz. The following day, forces from the &#x27;Polesie&#x27; Group passed the Świderki colonies of Bystrzyca, Wola Osowińska, Bełcząc and Ostrówek. The &#x27;Zaza&#x27; Division had settled in forests near the Tyśmianka river. One squadron of the 2nd Uhlan Regiment, who were defending a road, destroyed a German reconnaissance patrol. The command element of 5th Uhlan Regiment, and the &#x27;Olek&#x27; and &#x27;Wilk&#x27; infantry battalions attacked the Germans in Kock and captured the town.

==Battle of Kock==
On 30 September, the commander of 10th Army, Walter von Reichenau, ordered his staff to plan the destruction of a large Polish force which was located between the Bug and Vistula rivers. This task would involve the XIV Motorized Corps. It was made up of the 29th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht), the 13th Motorized Infantry Division, and some independent units. Each German motorized division had a paper strength of 16445 soldiers, 2676 trucks and staff cars, 1944 motorcycles, and 18 armored cars.

===2 October===
General Gustav Anton von Wietersheim, the commander of the XIV Motorized Corps, knew that Polish forces were situated in the forests northwest of Kock. He believed that the commander of the Polish forces was unaware of Warsaw&#x27;s capitulation.

The commander of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division, , was of the opinion that the Polish forces had become so demoralized that they were incapable of combat, and that a single German battalion would be enough to disarm the Poles and take them to a prisoner of war camp. General Otto sent a force consisting of 3rd Battalion, 93rd Motorized Infantry Regiment supported by 8th Battery, 13th Regiment of Light Artillery. The battalion commander decided to divide his forces into two groups which were sent to Serokomla and Kock. He could count on help from the 93rd Motorized Infantry Regiment with some support forces which followed him.

====Kock====
At 08:30, a column of half-tracks and truck-mounted infantry came under fire from a guard platoon of No. 2 company of the &#x27;Wilk&#x27; battalion. After a protracted engagement the German troops withdrew. The Polish 179th Infantry Regiment was alerted and moved to defensive positions near and in Kock. At about 11:00 the German lead elements attacked the Polish positions, which were now 2 battalions strong. In spite of supporting artillery fire, the attack failed. At dusk German motorcyclists appeared near the church in Kock and began firing, but subsequently withdrew when the fire was returned.

====Serokomla====
A company of motorized infantry entered the village of Serokomla. This led to the beginning of a chaotic action between the Germans and Uhlans from the &#x27;Pils&#x27; Cavalry Brigade, (commanded by Colonel Plisowski). The Poles were supported by an artillery unit from the same brigade. The Germans were forced to withdraw to the south of the village (see 3 October).

====Casualties====
German losses were 300–400 killed and wounded. Five officers, 180 NCOs and privates were captured by the Poles. Components of the &#x27;Pils&#x27; cavalry brigade lost about 200 killed or wounded.

===3 October ===
The stiff Polish resistance forced General Otto to use all his forces for an assault. He was going to split Polish forces in two and destroy them. He decided that the 33rd Motorized Infantry Regiment supported by part of the divisional artillery would attack Annopol, Pieńki and Talczyn. This force was tasked with destroying the Polish 50th Infantry Division. The 93rd Motorized Infantry Regiment was ordered to capture Serokomla, and then Hordzież, and to destroy a defensive formation of the &#x27;Zaza&#x27; cavalry division. The 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment entered the field of battle in the afternoon.

General Kleeberg thought that the main German advance would be toward the &#x27;Zaza&#x27; cavalry division at Serokomla/Hordzież. He decided that part of the cavalry would fend off the German attack. The rest would join a counter-attack alongside the 50th Infantry Division on the right wing and rear of the 13th German Motorized Infantry Division. The 60th Infantry Division and the &#x27;Podlaska Cavalry Brigade&#x27; would close off potential German attack routes. If this counter-attack was successful, the German division would be forced to withdraw behind the river Wieprz.

Between 07:50 and 09:30, two regiments of the 50th Infantry Division (the 180th and the 178th, less its 2nd battalion), attacked. They were supported by a howitzer battery. The attack was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Gorzkowski. Initially successful, the Polish units were halted and then forced onto the defensive. The cavalry attack by the Uhlans was also stopped and forced to withdraw west of Wola Gułowska.

At 10:30, German artillery began to fire on Polish cavalry positions. The 93rd Motorized Infantry Regiment began an attack on the &#x27;Wilk&#x27; battalion positions, inflicting heavy losses. The 33rd Motorized Infantry Regiment began a gradual attack on the Polish 50th Infantry Division.

After heavy fighting, the German advance was stopped. General Otto decided to support the 33rd Motorized Infantry Regiment with the 2nd Battalion of the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment. German formations captured Wola Gułowska, but in the evening, they were forced to withdraw from the eastern part of the area and go on the defensive in the west part.

===4 October===
Due to the 13th Motorized Infantry Division&#x27;s failure, General von Wietersheim was forced to use the 29th Motorized Infantry Division. General Otto ordered the 93rd Motorized Infantry Regiment to move from the Wieprz river to Dęblin. The 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment would attack Adamów and Wola Gułowska, and the 33rd Motorized Infantry Regiment would clear the area to the north of Kock.

General Kleeberg suspected that the main combined attack of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division and the 29th Motorized Infantry Division would be on Adamów and Krzywda. He thought there was a chance to destroy the 13th Motorized Infantry Division as they had already sustained heavy casualties and materiel losses. The &#x27;Zaza&#x27; cavalry division and the 50th Infantry Division would defend their positions, the 60th Infantry Division would attack the 13th Motorized Infantry Division. The Podlaska Cavalry Brigade would oppose the 29th Motorized Infantry Division.

In the morning, the main elements of 13th Motorized Infantry Division attacked the &#x27;Zaza&#x27; cavalry division and the 50th Infantry division. By 12:00 noon part of the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment had captured Zakępie and advanced on Adamów where they were halted by the 1st Battalion of the 180th Infantry Regiment.

About 11 hours apart, first from the west and then the east, forces from the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment attacked the &#x27;Olek&#x27; and &#x27;Wilk&#x27; battalions who were defending Czarna. The defenders sustained heavy casualties from artillery fire and &#x27;Wilk&#x27; was forced to withdraw to the eastern edge of the Adamów forest. &#x27;Olek&#x27;, moving to Adamów, later deployed to Gułów. Between 10:00 and 11:00 formations of the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment attacked formations of cavalry from the 5th Uhlan Regiment who then withdrew from Wola Gułowska and Adamów to the south-east.

At about 12:00 the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment attacked the 2nd Squadron of the 2nd Uhlan Regiment in Zarzecze which withdrew with heavy casualties. The commander of the regiment moved the 4th Squadron south from Helenów to try to assist the 2nd Squadron while the 3rd Squadron held the enemy to the west of Wola Gułowska. The 3rd and 4th Squadrons, with elements of the 10th Uhlan Regiment fought near the Turzystwo village cemetery and the church in Wola Gułowska. Ground was lost and regained repeatedly until an attack by the 2nd Battalion, 184th Infantry Regiment and the Uhlan Squadron enabled the Polish to dig in.

===5 October===
General von Wietersheim decided that he would use two of his divisions. They would attempt to encircle and destroy the Polish forces. The 13th Motorized Infantry Division advanced on Bystrzyca and Adamów then Nowa Wróblina and Stanin; the 29th Motorized Division advanced on Radoryż Kościelny and Nowa Wróblina where they met troops from the 13th Motorized Infantry Division.

General Kleeberg decided to destroy the 13th Motorized Infantry Division by using forces from the 50th and 60th infantry divisions and the &#x27;Zaza&#x27; cavalry division. The Podlaska Cavalry Brigade defended the position under Radoryż Kościelny and Nowa Wróblina.

====Fighting in Wojcieszków, Gułów and Adamów====
The 13th Motorized Infantry Division&#x27;s artillery began to fire on the 180th Infantry Regiment battalion&#x27;s positions in Adamów and the &#x27;Olek&#x27; Battalion in Gułów grange at 05:30. Two and a half hours later, the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment&#x27;s advance began. After a short fight at 10:00, the Germans captured Adamów, they then attacked the Polish position on hill 170 and Gułów, which they captured after heavy fighting. The 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment took many losses. The division occupied positions on the eastern edge of Adamów forest. General Podhorski sent the &#x27;Pils&#x27; cavalry brigade to support them. After contact with the enemy brigade, they began an attack on the German positions in the forest. They captured the forest and, there, they established defensive positions.

After the capture of Adamów and Gułów grange by the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment, the 33rd Motorized Infantry Regiment began to advance, capturing Wojcieszków and . The Polish 178th Infantry Regiment withdrew. The commander ordered his force to re-take Wojcieszków and Glinne, which they did, but they withdrew after taking heavy losses. The advance of the 180th Infantry Regiment on Adamów failed. Colonel Brzoza-Brzezina sent the 178th infantry regiment who soon met the German advance. The 1st battalion included a part company of sappers. The 2nd and 3rd battalions took heavy losses and withdrew to Burzec.

Meanwhile, an attack by the Polish 184th infantry regiment, with the support of a battalion of the 179th infantry regiment, recaptured the church and cemetery in Wola Gułowska. An advance by the 182nd Infantry Regiment with the help of three 100mm howitzers broke the German defense in Helenów.

At 16:00, the last German advance from Adamów began on positions of the 10th Uhlan Regiment in Krzywda forest by the 182nd regiment in Helenów and the 184th regiment in Wola Gułowska. The 10th Uhlan Regiment, after a hard fight, withdrew into the forest. Most forces of the &#x27;Brzoza&#x27; division successfully defended their positions in Burzec. The 182nd Infantry Regiment held their position. The 184th regiment had to withdraw due to a lack of artillery ammunition. During this time two key Polish advances began. The 2nd battalion of the 183rd Infantry Regiment, with artillery support, began an assault with the bayonet on the Germans who had attacked the southern wing of the &#x27;Pils&#x27; cavalry brigade.

The assault succeeded and the Germans began to retreat, being chased by infantry and cavalry. The rear of the southern wing of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division was attacked by the &#x27;Edward&#x27; cavalry brigade, they captured the village of Poznań, including a German artillery battery (which had to be destroyed when the cavalry were forced to withdraw due to them coming under fire from another German artillery battery). Elements of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division began to withdraw. One of the last attacks was by the 29th Motorized Division on the &#x27;Podlaska&#x27; Cavalry Brigade positions and the rear of the &#x27;Brzoza&#x27; Division. After that both Polish formations withdrew to the south of Krzywda.

At 16:30, General Kleeburg gave his last order in Hordzieżka, and then, as the Hordzieżka forest was being shelled, returned to his headquarters in Krzywda. At 20:40, Lieutenant Colonels Kazimierz Gorzkowski and Tadeusz Śmigielski left to establish contact with the command staff of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division. They made contact with the Germans near Adamów, and both sides agreed to a ceasefire lasting until 6 October (the next day) at 06:00, before which time a surrender was to be concluded.

Independent Operational Group Polesie surrendered on 6 October at 10:00. In his last order, General Kleeberg wrote that the reason for his decision to capitulate was that they were surrounded and ammunition and food were depleted.

General Kleeberg&#x27;s ceremonial surrender took place on 6 October at the Jabłonowskich Palace in Kock.

<doc id="659160" wikidata="Q333944" url="?curid=659160" title="Edward Short, Baron Glenamara">
<text>Edward Watson Short, Baron Glenamara, (17 December 1912 – 4 May 2012) was a British Labour Party politician and deputy leader of the Labour Party. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle upon Tyne Central and served as a minister during the Labour governments under Harold Wilson, before being appointed to the House of Lords shortly after James Callaghan became Prime Minister.

Following the death of James Allason on 16 June 2011, Short was the oldest living former member of the British House of Commons. He died just under a year later, aged 99. At the time of his death he was the oldest member of the House of Lords.

==Early career==
Short was born in Warcop, Westmorland. His father Charles Short, a draper, was married to Mary. Short qualified as a teacher at College of the Venerable Bede, Durham University, before completing a second degree, in law, at London University. He taught on Tyneside until enlisting in 1939. He served as a Captain in the Durham Light Infantry of the British Army during the Second World War. After leaving the army he returned to teaching, becoming Newcastle branch secretary of the National Union of Teachers and in 1947, head of Princess Louise Boys&#x27; School, Blyth. He married Jennie Sewell in 1941, and they had two children.

Short joined the Labour Party in 1942 and was elected a councillor on Newcastle City Council in 1948, where he led the Labour Group within two years. He was first elected to Parliament for Newcastle upon Tyne Central at the 1951 general election. He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1964, and was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1976.

==Postmaster General==
Short was responsible for the outlawing of pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline. Following the government campaign against the pirates previously led by Tony Benn, his predecessor in the post of Postmaster-General (then the minister with responsibility for broadcasting), Short was responsible for introducing the bill which became the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967. In a 1982 interview for BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Pop Radio&quot;, Short admitted having enjoyed listening to some of those stations, particularly Radio 390.

As Postmaster General, Short ordered the creation of the 1966 England Winners stamp to celebrate England&#x27;s victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup.

==Education Secretary==
He subsequently served as Education Secretary from 1968 to 1970, and became Labour&#x27;s deputy leader on 25 April 1972 after Roy Jenkins resigned over differences on European policy. Short was seen at the time as a &quot;safe pair of hands&quot;. His main rival for the job was the left-winger Michael Foot who was viewed by many on the centre and right of the party as a divisive figure. Short defeated Foot and Anthony Crosland in the same vote. During his tenure he ended the policy of free milk for secondary school students, a policy that would be controversially extended to 7-11 year olds by his Conservative Party successor Margaret Thatcher.

==Lord President of the Council==
Short&#x27;s new seniority was reflected in 1974 as his appointment as Lord President of the Council – though not Deputy Prime Minister. While he stood in for Wilson at cabinet meetings and prime minister&#x27;s questions, he did not have the stature to mount a leadership bid himself upon the prime minister&#x27;s retirement in 1976. He was not offered a Cabinet post on James Callaghan&#x27;s election as Prime Minister. His resignation letter said that the time had come for him to step aside for a younger man; this was sarcasm, as he was replaced by Michael Foot, who was only seven months younger than himself. Short was also nine months younger than Callaghan, who had dropped him from the cabinet. Barbara Castle made similar remarks, having also been dropped from the cabinet.

==Peerage==
He was made a life peer as Baron Glenamara, of Glenridding in the County of Cumbria on 28 January 1977, a few months after he had left the Commons. One year prior to that, he was appointed Chairman of Cable and Wireless Ltd, which was at the time a nationalised industry. He served in that post until 1980.

As a life peer he was a member of the House of Lords, although a few years before his death he ceased to attend regularly.

His name lives on in the House of Commons with the term &quot;Short Money&quot;. This refers to funds paid by the Government to help run the Parliamentary office of the Leader of the Opposition. The then Mr Short pioneered this idea during his time in the House.

He was made a Freeman of the City of Newcastle in 2001 &quot;in recognition of his eminent and outstanding public service&quot; and served as Chancellor of the University of Northumbria, a post he retired from in 2005. Short died in Hexham on 4 May 2012, at the age of 99.

<doc id="659161" wikidata="Q336031" url="?curid=659161" title="Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent">
<text>Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, KG, PC (16715 June 1740) was a British politician and courtier. None of his sons outlived him, so his new title became extinct on his death. Though the house he built at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire has gone, parts of his very grand garden have survived relatively untouched.

==Family==
He was a son of Anthony Grey, 11th Earl of Kent, and Mary Grey, 1st Baroness Lucas of Crudwell. He succeeded his father as 12th Earl of Kent in 1702, having succeeded his mother as 2nd Baron Lucas earlier the same year. He was the grandfather, through his daughter Anne Grey, of Henry Cavendish, the preeminent English chemist and physicist of the late 18th century.

==Political career==
Having taken his seat in the House of Lords and though regarded as lacking talent and ambition he, as the politically expedient candidate, was made Lord Chamberlain and a Privy Councillor in 1704. Grey was unpopular; he was nicknamed &#x27;Bug&#x27; for his body odour. He traded his position for a dukedom in 1710, and was succeeded as Lord Chamberlain by the Duke of Shrewsbury. Contemporary commentators including John Macky and Jonathan Swift did defend Grey. He might have been, for his time, the right man in the right place.

After 1710 he served in politically minor positions: Gentleman of the Bedchamber, Constable of Windsor Castle, Lord Steward of the Household from 1716 until 1718, and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal from 1719 until 1720. He was one of the Lords Justices appointed during the absence of George I of Great Britain.

In 1719, Grey was one of the main subscribers in the eighteenth-century Royal Academy of Music, a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage. At the age of 68, a year before his death, he took part, as a founding governor, in the creation of Britain&#x27;s first home for abandoned children, London&#x27;s Foundling Hospital.

==Titles==
Grey succeeded his father as 12th Earl of Kent in 1702, having succeeded his mother as 2nd Baron Lucas earlier the same year. He was created Marquess of Kent, Earl of Harold and Viscount Goderich in 1706, Duke of Kent in 1710 for relinquishing his Lord Chamberlain position, and made a Knight of the Garter in 1712. Left without a male heir after the death of his son George Grey, Earl of Harold, in 1733, he was created Marquess Grey in 1740, with a special remainder to his granddaughter Lady Jemima Campbell and her heirs male. She also succeeded to the Barony of Lucas. All his other titles became extinct at his death.

==Marriages and children==
Henry married firstly, in 1694, Jemima Crew (died 2 July 1728), a daughter of Thomas Crew, 2nd Baron Crew, and his second wife, Anne Armine, daughter of Sir William Armine, 2nd Baronet. They had at least six children:

*Anthony Grey, Earl of Harold (died 1723). Married Lady Mary Tufton, a daughter of Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, and Lady Catharine Cavendish.
*Henry Grey (c. 16961717).
*Amabel Grey (died 2 March 1726). Married John Campbell, 3rd Earl of Breadalbane and Holland.
*Jemima Grey (c. 16997 July 1731). Married John Ashburnham, 1st Earl of Ashburnham.
*Anne Grey (died 20 September 1733). Married Lord Charles Cavendish.
*Mary Grey. Married David Gregory of Christ Church.

He married secondly Sophia Bentinck (died 5 June 1741) on 24 March 1729, a daughter of William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland, and his second wife Jane Martha Temple. They had a son and a daughter:

*George Grey, Earl of Harold (c. 1732–1733)
*Anne Sophia Grey (died 24 March 1780). Married John Egerton, Bishop of Durham.

<text>The Laguna Copperplate Inscription () is an official (debt relief) certificate inscribed onto a copper plate in the Shaka year 822 (Gregorian A.D. 900). It is the earliest-known, extant, calendar-dated document found within the Philippines.

The plate was found in 1987 by a laborer near the mouth of the Lumbang River in Wawa, Lumban, Laguna, in the Philippines. The inscription was mainly written in Old Malay using the Early Kawi script, with several technical Sanskrit words and either Old Javanese or Old Tagalog honorifics. After it was found, the text was first translated in 1991 by Antoon Postma, a Dutch anthropologist and Hanunó&#x27;o script researcher.

The inscription documents the existence and names of several surrounding states as of A.D. 900, such as the Tagalog city-state of Tondo. Some historians associate the toponym &quot;Medang&quot; in this inscription regarding the Medang palace in Java at that time, although the name is a common term of Malayo-Polynesian origin.

==Description==
The inscription is made out of copper and measures about , with the words directly embossed onto the plate. It differs in manufacture from Javanese scrolls of the period, which had the words inscribed onto a heated, softened metal scroll.

It records the date as the year 822 of the Shaka era, the month of Vaishakha, and the fourth day of the waning moon on the weekday of Somavara, which corresponds to Monday, April 21, 900, on the Julian calendar. The text is Old Malay, with numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin may be Old Javanese. The Sanskrit words are used for technical terms, while the Javanese words are used for forms of address. The Old Malay it uses differs from examples found in Java and Sumatra. The document states that it releases its bearers, the children of &quot;Namwaran&quot;, from debt in gold amounting to 1 &quot;kati&quot; and 8 &quot;suwarnas&quot; (865 grams; 27.8 troy ounces).

==Analysis==
Postma, who first translated the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, suggested that the place names and personal names in the inscription needed to be carefully studied by scholars because &quot;they furnish vital clues regarding the political and topographic background&quot; of the world around the time of the inscription. He identified as toponyms the words &quot;Pailah&quot;, &quot;Tundun&quot;, &quot;Puliran&quot;, and &quot;Binuangan&quot;, and posited that &quot;Dewata&quot; and &quot;Medang&quot; could be either personal names or toponyms. Postma identified three of these toponyms, &quot;Binuangan&quot;, &quot;Pailah&quot;, and &quot;Puliran&quot;, as Malayo-Polynesian in origin, and three other toponyms, &quot;Tundun&quot;, &quot;Dewata&quot;, and &quot;Mdang&quot;, as being of Sanskrit origin.

After carefully considering possible interpretations of the text, including the possibility that Pailah and Puliran were located in the Laguna Lake region, Postma concluded that he was confident that Binuangan, Pailah, and Puliran &quot;find their equivalents within the limited area of what is now known as Bulacan Province in the Philippines, [and that] the text of this same inscription can be considered to refer indeed to these places, already existing already under identical names in the tenth century&quot;. The text itself, however, being written in 900, was created in the ninth century.

===Toponyms as Bulacan settlements===
Postma emphasized that his interpretation of the inscription place names being in Bulacan puts these named settlements on key locations on Central Luzon&#x27;s river systems, which he referred to as &quot;water highways&quot;, which allowed &quot;an effective (and often only) means of transportation and communication between the different settlements&quot;, as well as providing Chinese and Southeast Asian maritime traders easy access to interior trading centers via rivers. He also noted that Central Luzon&#x27;s rivers were &quot;much deeper and certainly were more navigable than they are today&quot;.

Postma&#x27;s assertions have been challenged, notably by the Pila Historical Society Foundation and local historian Jaime F. Tiongson, but have not been fully resolved by scholarly peer review.

===Words affirmed as toponyms===
Postma asserted that he was fairly certain that four words in the inscription were place names, or toponyms: &quot;Pailah&quot; (lines 4 and 6), &quot;Tundun&quot; (line 3), &quot;Puliran&quot; (line 6), and &quot;Binuangan&quot; (line 7).

====Tundun====
Tundun, whose name Postma believed to be &quot;Sanskrit in origin&quot;, was referenced in line 3 of the inscription. It is the most easily recognizable of the toponyms identified by Postma in the inscription, and scholarly consensus generally agrees with Postma&#x27;s original identification of the inscription&#x27;s Tundun as Tondo, the polity located on the northern seaside of the Pasig River delta, where the Pasig River empties into Manila Bay.

Postma left an avenue for an alternative interpretation open, however, saying that Mdang and Tondo &quot;because of their lingual consonants (n and d) that are of Sanskrit origin might originally be toponyms existing on the Island of Java&quot;.

====Pailah====
Postma identified Pailah, whose name he believed to be Austronesian in origin, as a &quot;locality with its leader&quot;. It was referenced twice, in lines 4 and 6 of the inscription. Locating its possible location in Bulacan, Postma proposed its site to be &quot;the village of Paila, in Barangay of San Lorenzo at the eastern part of the municipality of Norzagaray, with coordinates 14–54.5 &amp; 121-06.9&quot;. However, it might also be referred to the Pailaha region part of North Sulawesi province located in the northern Sulawesi.

====Puliran====
Postma identified Puliran, whose name he believed to be Austronesian in origin, as a &quot;locality with its own leader&quot; referenced in line 6 of the inscription. Postma asserted that Puliran was probably located in modern-day Bulacan, on the current site of &quot;Pulilan, along the Angat River (pronounced: Anggat) north of Manila, (coordinates: 14–54.2 &amp; 120-50.8)&quot;.

====Binuangan====
Postma believed that the place-name of Binuangan, referenced in line 7 of the inscription as a locality with its own leader, was Austronesian in origin. Locating its possible location in Bulacan, Postma proposed its site to be &quot;the village of Binuangan, belonging to the municipality of Obando, situated at the mouth of the Bulacan River, with coordinates 14–43.2 &amp; 120–543&quot;.

===Inscription words believed to be possible place names===
Based on linguistic analysis, Postma concluded that the words Dewata and Mdang &quot;could be either personal names or toponyms&quot;. He noted that their names seemed to be Sanskrit in origin but did not go into a deep discussion of where they might have been located, other than to say Mdang was already known as a place name in Indonesia.

Abinales and Amoroso (2005) note that the leaders of Dewata and Mdang (if these words are indeed to be accepted as toponyms) were not present for the transaction but were rather invoked as authorities in certifying the cancellation of the debt in question: &quot;Jayadewa invokes the authority of the chief of Dewata, who in turn represents the chief of Medang&quot;.

====Mdang====
Postma&#x27;s paper proposing his translation and interpretation of the inscription mentions that his search of the Indonesian toponym listings developed by Damais and Darmosoetopo, as well as his consultation with the 14th Congress of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association (IPPA) in August 1990, determined that Mdang was the only (possible) toponym in the inscription that matched known Indonesian place names.

Abinales and Amoroso (2005), citing Patanñe (1996) note that this seems to refer to &quot;a temple complex in Java, where the kingdom of Mataram was a rival to Srivijaya&quot;.

====Dewata====
Scholars after Postma, such as Patanñe (1996) and Abinales and Amoroso (2005) have come to identify the Dewata of the inscription as a settlement in or near &quot;present-day Mount Diwata, near Butuan&quot;.

While it is clear from the text of the inscription that Jayadewa of Tondo is invoking the authority of the Chief of Dewata, the precise relationship between Dewata and Mdang is less clear. E.P. Patanñe notes: &quot;This relationship is unclear but a possible explanation is that the chief of Dewata wanted it to be known that he had a royal connection in Java.&quot;

===Other proposed interpretations of toponyms===
Postma&#x27;s assertions regarding the exact locations of &quot;Pailah&quot;, &quot;Puliran&quot;, and &quot;Binuangan&quot; have been challenged by the Pila Historical Society Foundation and local historian Jaime F. Tiongson, who assert that the place names &quot;Pailah&quot; and &quot;Puliran&quot; are more likely to refer to places close to where the plate was found—in Lumban—given that archeological findings in nearby Pila show the presence of an extensive settlement during precolonial times.

According to Tiongson&#x27;s interpretation, &quot;Pailah&quot; refers to Pila; &quot;Puliran&quot; refers to Puliran, the old name of the territory that occupied the southeastern part of Laguna de Bay at the time; and &quot;Binuangan&quot; refers to a modern-day barangay, Binawangan in Capalonga, Camarines Norte.

===Vocabularies===
The inscription contains a great number of words derived from Sanskrit, starting with a line of astronomical terms that indicate the date of the inscription in detail. It also has some Old Javanese and Old Tagalog words expressing ceremonious forms of address. However, the main language of the inscription is Old Malay, which served as the &quot;lingua franca&quot;, or trade language, of the whole archipelago during those times. The most significant indication of Old Malay features is found in verbal affixes used in the inscription, e.g. &quot;bar-&quot;, &quot;di-&quot;, and &quot;dipar-&quot;, which correspond to &quot;ber-&quot;, &quot;di-&quot;, and &quot;diper-&quot;, respectively, in modern Malay and Indonesian. Old Malay words and their modern Malay and Indonesian counterparts are listed below, each followed by its English gloss:

* = &quot;sana&quot; = there
* = &quot;tatkala&quot; = while, during
* = &quot;dayang&quot; (also used in Tag.) = court maiden
* = &quot;lawan&quot; (Tag. cognate is ) = counterpart
* = &quot;dengan&quot; = with
* = &quot;-nya&quot; = his / her / its (possessive suffix)
* = &quot;sanak&quot; = relative, kindred
* = &quot;anak&quot; (also used in Tag.) = child
* = &quot;beri&quot; (Tag. cognate is ) = give
* = &quot;oleh&quot; = by, from
* , = &quot;di&quot; = at, in, of
* = &quot;jadi&quot; = become
* = &quot;tuan&quot; = leader, master
* = &quot;sudah&quot; = already
* = &quot;lepas&quot; (Tagalog cognate is ) = unbounded, escaped
* = &quot;hutang&quot; (Tagalog/Indonesian cognate is ) = debt
* = &quot;hadapan&quot; (borrowed into Tag. as ) = in front
* = &quot;tetapi&quot; = but
* = &quot;sadanya&quot; (preserved in Minangkabau) = whole, all
* = &quot;dari&quot; = from
* = &quot;bakti&quot; = dedication, devotion
* = &quot;hulun&quot; (Classical Mal.) = slave, subject
* = &quot;makanya&quot; = therefore
* = &quot;cucu&quot; = grandchild
* = &quot;diperhabis&quot; = cleared (compare to Old Javanese &quot;(h)awis&quot; = cleared)
* = &quot;ini&quot; = this
* = (Classical Mal.) = perchance
* = &quot;hari&quot; = day
* = &quot;kemudian&quot; = afterwards, later
* = &quot;ada&quot; = exist, there is
* = &quot;orang&quot; = person, people
* = (Classical Mal.) = state, say, utter (compare to Old Javanese &quot;tujara&quot;)
* = &quot;belum&quot; = not yet

Aside from the Sanskrit and Old Malay words, there are also some pure Old Javanese words that have no cognates in Old Malay, or at least have not been found in other Old Malay inscriptions, like &quot;ngaran&quot; (name) and &quot;pamegat&quot; (leader, chief). In an Old Malay inscription, one would expect &quot;barnama&quot; instead of &quot;barngaran&quot; because &quot;nama&quot; is the Sanskrit-derived word for &#x27;name&#x27; in Old and Modern Malay. &quot;Pamegat&quot; is another Old Javanese word that frequently occurs in Old Javanese inscriptions but not in Old Malay ones. It is often preceded by the honorific &quot;sang&quot;, as in the inscription. These words are accepted as Old Javanese words but could be Old Tagalog as well because they exist in both of these languages.

==Significance==
The Laguna Copperplate Inscription, together with other recent finds such as the Golden Tara of Butuan and 14th-century pottery and gold jewelry in Cebu, is highly important in revising ancient Philippine history, which some Western historians previously considered culturally isolated from the rest of Asia, as no evident pre-Hispanic written records had been found at the time. Philippine historian William Henry Scott debunked these theories in 1968 with his &quot;Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History&quot;, which was subsequently published in 1984. The locations mentioned are all near rivers, suggesting Old Malay may have come to the area along trade networks.

The inscription demonstrates pre-Hispanic literacy and culture and is considered a national treasure. It is currently deposited at the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.

It is the earliest document that shows the use of mathematics in precolonial Philippine societies. The use of precise measurement for gold demonstrates a standard system of weights and measures, and fixing the precise day within the month in relation to the phases of the moon shows familiarity with rudimentary astronomy.

==Southeast Asian context ==

Prior to the European colonial era, Southeast Asia was under the Indosphere of greater India, where numerous Indianized principalities and empires flourished for several centuries in what are now Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia, and central and southern Vietnam. The influence of Indian culture in these areas was given the term &quot;indianization&quot;. French archaeologist George Coedes defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed by the Indian origins of royalty, Hinduism and Buddhism, and the Sanskrit dialect. This can be seen in the Indianization of Southeast Asia, the spread of Hinduism, and the transmission of Buddhism. The Indian diaspora, both ancient (PIO) and current (NRI), played an ongoing key role as professionals, traders, priests, and warriors. Indian honorifics also influenced Malay, Thai, Filipino, and Indonesian honorifics.

The pre-colonial native Filipino script called Baybayin (), known in Visayan as &quot;badlit&quot; (), as &quot;kur-itan/kurditan&quot; in Ilocano, and as &quot;kulitan&quot; in Kapampangan, was itself derived from the Brahmic scripts of India. Its use was recorded in the 16th century by Miguel López de Legazpi.

==Cultural references==

The inscription shows heavy Sanskrit and Old Javanese linguistic influences. Among the observations made by Antonio Pigafetta in the 16th-century &quot;Boxer Codex&quot; was that Old Malay had currency among classical-period Filipinos as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;. The Golden Tara statue, an ancient artifact discovered in Butuan, Agusan del Norte, dates from the same period and strongly suggests the presence of Hindu–Buddhist beliefs prior to the introduction (and subsequent subscription) to Roman Catholicism and Islam among Filipinos.

==Other inscriptions from nearby regions==
These inscriptions are all from the province of Central Java, Indonesia (excepting for the Kalasan inscription, which is in the adjacent Special Region of Yogyakarta).
*Canggal inscription (732)
*Kalasan inscription (778)
*Kelurak inscription (782)
*Karangtengah inscription (824)
*Tri Tepusan inscription (842)
*Shivagrha inscription (856)
*Mantyasih inscription (907)

==Discovery==

The Laguna Copperplate Inscription was found in 1987 near the mouth of the Lumbang River near Laguna de Bay by a man named Ernesto Legisma, who was dredging sand to turn it into concrete. Suspecting that the artifact might have some value, the man sold it to an antique dealer, who, having found no buyers, eventually sold it to the National Museum of the Philippines, where it was assigned to Alfredo E. Evangelista, head of its anthropology department. The National Museum refers to the artifact as the &quot;Laguna Copper Plate&quot;.

A year later, Antoon Postma noted that the inscription was similar to the ancient Indonesian script of Kawi. Postma translated the script and found the document dated itself to the Saka year 822, an old Hindu calendar date that corresponds to the year 900. It is from about the same time as the mention of the Philippines in the official Chinese Song dynasty &quot;History of Song&quot; for the year 972.

<text>Master Commandant William Henry Allen (October 21, 1784 – August 18, 1813) was an American naval officer during the War of 1812.

==Early life==
Allen was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and was appointed a midshipman in the United States Navy on April 28, 1800. Shortly after his appointment Allen was ordered on board the frigate &quot;George Washington&quot;, commanded by captain Bainbridge. On board of USS &quot;George Washington&quot;, he sailed to Algiers. Upon returning to the United States in April 1801, he was ordered on board of USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, commanded by captain Samuel Barron. With USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, he sailed the Mediterranean Sea until June 1802. Allen sailed back to the Mediterranean again from October 1802 until December 1803 on board of USS &quot;John Adams&quot;.

In 1804 he was appointed sailing-master of USS &quot;Congress&quot;. Under the command of captain Rodgers, he sailed for the Mediterranean. In October 1805, together with captain Rogers Allen was removed to USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, and promoted to a lieutenancy. In 1806, Allen returned on board of USS &quot;Constitution&quot; to the United States. On February 17, 1807, after a short break in Providence, he was attached to USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, where he served in the rank third lieutenant under the command of captain Baron.

On June 21, 1807, he participated in the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;-&quot;Leopard&quot; Affair in which USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was boarded by the British and four sailors were taken captive on suspicion of being deserters from the Royal Navy. Allen was credited with firing the only gun discharged in her own defense by the American ship. The incident was a key development in building American resentment toward the British which eventually resulted in the War of 1812.

In 1809, Allen was transferred to USS &quot;United States&quot;, under the command of Captain Stephen Decatur.

==War of 1812==
By 1812, Allen as a first lieutenant of the frigate &quot;United States&quot; took part in the engagement with HMS &quot;Macedonian&quot;. At the conclusion of that capture, he was named to command the prize crew which took &quot;Macedonian&quot; into New York. After that Lieutenant Allen took some time off from the naval service in Providence, but was called on active duty once again. On July 24, 1813, by order of Commodore Decatur he was assigned to command the brig &quot;Argus&quot; as a master commandant. William Henry Allen would conduct commerce raiding hunting British shipping.

===Capturing the &quot;Matilda&quot;===
William Henry Allen was ordered to raid and destroy enemy shipping thus not to take prizes unless he deplete his numbers. He broke out of New York Harbor on June 18, 1813, eluding the Royal Navy blockade. Allen arrived at Lorient in Brittany, on July 11, 1813, to raid British shipping. They captured the British schooner &quot;Matilda&quot; on July 24. Allen put a prize crew on her and sent her to France. Matilda was recaptured by a British frigate and all 11 American prize crew members were locked in prison.

==Death==
Allen died on August 18, 1813, and was buried with full military honors in the churchyard of St Andrew&#x27;s, Plymouth, England.

==Legacy==
In 1814 a small row galley was named the USS &quot;Allen&quot; in his honor.

The destroyer USS &quot;Allen&quot; (DD-66) was also named after him. The &quot;Allen&quot; served during World War I and was present at Pearl Harbor during the attack on December 7, 1941. The &quot;Allen&quot; was the oldest destroyer in the Navy during World War II. She was assigned to training duties and spent the remainder of the war at Pearl Harbor. After the war, she was decommissioned and sold for scrap.

* Allen Street in Manhattan, New York City
* It is possible that Allens Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island, was named after him.
* Fort Allen in Portland, Maine, was named after him shortly after his death.

==Family==
His father, William Allen, soon after the start of the American Revolution in June 1775, was commissioned an ensign in the 3rd Rhode Island Regiment in the Continental Army. His regiment served in the Siege of Boston and was disbanded on December 31, 1775. In January 1776, he was promoted to 1st lieutenant in the 11th Continental Infantry Regiment and served until the regiment was disbanded at the end of the year. In January 1777 he was promoted to captain in the 2nd Rhode Island Regiment. He commanded a company of the Rhode Island line of troops at the Battle of Saratoga. He transferred to the 1st Rhode Island Regiment when the two Rhode Island regiments were consolidated on January 1, 1781. William Allen was present and actively engaged in many of the battles which were fought during our Revolutionary War. In recognition of his service, he was advanced to the brevet (honorary) rank of major on September 30, 1783. He served until the Continental Army was disbanded on November 3, 1783. In 1786, Allen was appointed by Congress, senior officer of the legionary corps raised in Rhode Island. In 1799, he was appointed by the Rhode Island General Assembly a brigadier general of militia.

The mother of William Henry Allen, was the sister of William Jones, who served as Governor of Rhode Island.

<doc id="659165" wikidata="Q5629537" url="?curid=659165" title="HGH controversies">
<text>Controversies regarding the use of human growth hormone (HGH) as treatment method have centered on the claims, products, and businesses related to the use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy. Most of these controversies fall into two categories:

# Claims of exaggerated, misleading, or unfounded assertions that growth hormone treatment safely and effectively slows or reverses the effects of aging.
# The sale of products that fraudulently or misleadingly purport to be growth hormone or to increase the user&#x27;s own secretion of natural human growth hormone to a beneficial degree.

== History ==
A study was published in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in 1990 by Rudman &quot;et al.&quot;, which showed fat loss, muscle mass increase and maintenance of healthy skin from the administration of growth hormone in twelve elderly men. Despite the fact the authors at no time claimed that GH had reversed the aging process itself, their results were misinterpreted as indicating that GH is an effective anti-aging agent. This study, and others, has led to organizations such as the controversial American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine promoting the use of this hormone as an &quot;anti-aging agent&quot;.

Additionally, companies selling dietary supplements have websites selling products that claim to be linked to GH in the advertising text, with medical-sounding names described as &quot;HGH Releasers&quot;. Typical ingredients include amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and/or herbal extracts, the combination of which are described as causing the body to make more GH with corresponding beneficial effects. In the United States, because these products are marketed as dietary supplements it is illegal for them to contain GH, which is a drug. Also, under United States law, products sold as dietary supplements cannot have claims that the supplement treats or prevents any disease or condition, and the advertising material must contain a statement that the health claims are not approved by the FDA. The FTC and the FDA do enforce the law when they become aware of violations.

As a result of the reactions to the 1990 article and its frequent citation by proponents of HGH as any anti-aging agent, in 2003 the NEJM published two articles that came out strongly and clearly stating that there was insufficient medical and scientific evidence to support use of HGH as anti-aging drug. One article was written by the Journal&#x27;s then-current editor in chief, Jeffrey M. Drazen, M.D. and was entitled, &quot;Inappropriate Advertising of Dietary Supplements&quot;. It focused mostly on the advertising of dietary supplements. The other article was written by the editor-in-chief at the time the 1990 article was published, Mary Lee Vance, M.D., and was entitled, &quot;Can Growth Hormone Prevent Aging?&quot;; it focused more on the medical issues around whether there was sufficient evidence to use HGH as an anti-aging agent.

== Research ==

There has never been an adequately large randomized controlled trial to prove definitively that HGH provides significant anti-aging benefits and that there are no significant adverse drug reactions; there have been many small studies which are described below.

Some scientific articles have demonstrated that HGH supplementation does not significantly increase muscle strength or aerobic exercise capacity in healthy individuals. While it is possible that there are some advantages, such as an increase in lean body mass, it is also evident that benefits are being exaggerated by some for commercial gain and ineffective products are being sold to unsuspecting consumers.

Some recent small clinical studies have shown that low-dose GH treatment for elderly patients with GH deficiency changes the body composition by increasing muscle mass, decreasing fat mass, increasing bone density and muscle strength, improves cardiovascular parameters (i.e. decrease of LDL cholesterol), and affects the quality of life without significant side effects. It must be emphasized that these studies were small—only tens of patients—and the results were therefore stated tentatively; in the words of one of the cited sources: &quot;Clearly more studies are needed before GH replacement for the elderly becomes established. Safety issues will require close scrutiny, but the data available so far are sufficiently positive to undertake large multicentre, placebo-controlled trials, particularly looking at endpoints associated with prevention of frailty and loss of independence.&quot;

== Side-effects of high doses and long-term use ==

Some of the side effects reportedly seen in previously healthy mature patients after taking high HGH doses include:
* Edema (retention of fluids) in extremities
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Carpal tunnel syndrome
* Hypertension.
* Diabetes and other glucose metabolism imbalances
* Gynecomastia (enlargement of male mammary glands)

Chronic use of HGH is not well studied. However, in Europe a study called &quot;SAGhE&quot; was undertaken to study these long-term effects of HGH in children. The FDA reviewed the study and other medical literature and found no link between HGH intake and an increased risk of death.

==Law==

In 1990, the US Congress passed an omnibus crime bill, the Crime Control Act of 1990, that amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that classified anabolic steroids as controlled substances and added a new section which reads:
Prohibited distribution of human growth hormone.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), whoever knowingly distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute, human growth hormone for any use in humans other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition, where such use has been authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under section 355 of this title and pursuant to the order of a physician, is guilty of an offense punishable by not more than 5 years in prison, such fines as are authorized by title 18, or both.
(2) Whoever commits any offense set forth in paragraph (1) and such offense involves an individual under 18 years of age is punishable by not more than 10 years imprisonment, such fines as are authorized by title 18, or both.
(3) Any conviction for a violation of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be considered a felony violation of the Controlled Substances Act [21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.] for the purposes of forfeiture under section 413 of such Act [21 U.S.C. 853].
(4) As used in this subsection the term “human growth hormone” means somatrem, somatropin, or an analogue of either of them.
(5) The Drug Enforcement Administration is authorized to investigate offenses punishable by this subsection.

This section has been taken by some, most notably the authors of a commentary article published in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; in 2005, as meaning that &quot;prescribing&quot; HGH off-label may be considered illegal. &quot;Physicians and other health care professionals should be aware that current law explicitly prohibits the distribution of GH except for clearly and narrowly defined indications. Distribution for other uses, or off-label use, such as for antiaging, age-related conditions, and enhancing athletic performance, are illegal. Although GH is not a schedule III drug, section 303 [333] f(5) of the FDCA clearly provides the Drug Enforcement Administration with the responsibility of enforcing the laws governing human GH. Given the clinical concerns and the legal issues involved, we believe that physicians or other persons who currently market, distribute, or administer GH to their patients for any reason other than the well-defined approved (ie, legal) uses of the drug, should not do so.&quot;

The Drug Enforcement Administration of the US Department of Justice considers off-label prescribing of HGH to be illegal, and to be a key path for illicit distribution of HGH. The FDA, as recently as 2012, has issued alerts stating that &quot;FDA-approved HGH can be legally prescribed for a limited number of conditions.&quot; The FDA and the Department of Justice have shut down companies and compounding pharmacies that have marketed HGH for off-label purposes – especially for bodybuilding and anti-aging uses. And some articles in the popular press, such as those criticizing the pharmaceutical industry for marketing drugs for off-label use (which is clearly illegal) have made strong statements about whether doctors can prescribe HGH off-label: &quot;Unlike other prescription drugs, HGH may be prescribed only for specific uses. U.S. sales are limited by law to treat a rare growth defect in children and a handful of uncommon conditions like short bowel syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome, a congenital disease that causes reduced muscle tone and a lack of hormones in sex glands.&quot;

At the same time, anti-aging clinics where doctors prescribe, administer, and sell HGH to people are big business. In a 2012 article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, when asked how HGH prescriptions far exceed the number of adult patients far exceeds the estimates for HGH-deficiency, Dr. Dragos Roman, who leads a team at the FDA that reviews drugs in endocrinology, said &quot;The F.D.A. doesn&#x27;t regulate off-label uses of H.G.H. Sometimes it&#x27;s used appropriately. Sometimes it&#x27;s not.&quot;

<doc id="659166" wikidata="Q1086679" url="?curid=659166" title="Love Shine a Light">
<text>&quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; is a song by British rock band Katrina and the Waves written by Kimberley Rew. It in the Eurovision Song Contest 1997 held in Dublin, resulting in the country&#x27;s fifth and most recent win at the contest. It was released as a single on 28 April 1997 and later included on the band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Walk on Water&quot; (1997), serving as the album&#x27;s lead single.

The song was the group&#x27;s biggest success since their 1985 hit &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;. It peaked within the top five of the charts in Austria, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In 2022, it was named the best UK Eurovision entry by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

== Background ==
=== Composition and Eurovision selection ===
The song was composed by the group&#x27;s guitarist and regular songwriter Kimberley Rew following a request from the brother of the group&#x27;s drummer Alex Cooper for an anthem for Samaritans in recognition of the thirtieth anniversary of the Swindon branch of that organization – Cooper&#x27;s brother being a member of that branch. In a 1997 interview Katrina and the Waves lead vocalist Katrina Leskanich indicated that it was members of the Samaritans who opined that &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; &quot;was the type of song which would win the Eurovision Song Contest and [so] at the last minute, [Katrina and the Waves] submitted the song with our £250 [entrance fee]&quot; for consideration to vie in the &quot;&quot;, the organised by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to select its song and performer for the of the Eurovision Song Contest.

It was also reported that Carmina Cooper, the manager of Katrina and the Waves and Alex Cooper&#x27;s wife, met up with BBC Radio Cambridgeshire&#x27;s breakfast presenter (and Head of Music) Dan Chisholm to play the track for him: Chisholm&#x27;s response was to urge that the number be entered in the &quot;Great British Song Contest&quot;, and after affording &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; its radio airplay debut, Chisholm declared it &quot;the song which will win this year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest&quot;.

In a 2010 interview Leskanich would state that &quot;Great British Song Contest&quot; executive producer Jonathan King had in fact initiated Katrina and the Waves involvement in the &quot;Great British Contest&quot; as he had contacted Leskanich to ask if her group had a song which might be a suitable contender to vie for the UK entrant at Eurovision 1997. Leskanich would paraphrase her response to King as being: &quot;Yes, we have this song called &#x27;Love Shine A Light&#x27; which we’ve never put on a record because it&#x27;s too cheesy, too ABBA, too Eurovision, so it would be perfect for you.&quot;

Leskanich stated in 2010 that the original plan was that an act other than Katrina and the Waves would be found to perform &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; for Eurovision consideration but that Warner Bros. Records executive Steve Allan – who Leskanich describes as &quot;a big Eurovision fan...it’s always been his dream to win it&quot; – said: &quot;Look, you guys have a name, we can still do business in Europe. All you need is a hit song, and we want you to do it. And if you do do it we’ll give you a record deal&quot;; adds Leskanich: &quot;So we couldn’t say no.&quot; Leskanich would also state that Kimberley Rew had said of Katrina and the Waves pursuing the Eurovision title with his composition: &quot;I’m not having anything to do with it&quot;. 
The 9 March 1997 broadcast of the &quot;Great British Song Contest&quot; final featured a taped interview with Rew, in which he described Eurovision as &quot;one of those great institutions of life&quot;; he also accompanied Leskanich onstage to be congratulated for &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot;&#x27;s being announced as the for Eurovision 1997. However, he didn&#x27;t perform on stage for this appearance or the Eurovision final held on 3 May 1997.

In a 2020 interview, Leskanich revealed that she was asked if she could &quot;try and talk like an English person&quot; as some people were not happy with the UK being represented at the Eurovision Song Contest by an American artist.

One of eight songs aired in the &quot;Great British Song Contest&quot; semi-final broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on 7 February 1997, &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; was one of four songs advanced by televote to the &quot;Great British Song Contest&quot; final. The &quot;Great British Song Contest&quot; final was a live performance show broadcast by BBC TV on 9 March 1997, at the conclusion of which &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; was announced as the 1997 UK entrant in Eurovision, the song having received 69,834 televotes – 11,138 more than the second-place finisher.

=== Eurovision performance ===
On 3 May 1997, the Eurovision Song Contest was held at the Point Theatre in Dublin hosted by (RTÉ), and broadcast live throughout the continent. Katrina and the Waves performed &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; twenty-fourth in a field of twenty-five songs being preceded by the entry &quot;Probudi me&quot; and followed with the entry &quot;Minn hinsti dans&quot;.

Leskanich would later state she&#x27;d supplied her own outfit for her performance on Eurovision: &quot;the boys [ie. the Waves] were getting beautiful suits made by William Hunt and my outfit was an afterthought. They came [in] with five different designers and every single outfit made me look like a clown or a chair cover...I ended up wearing this green blouse I’d been wearing all week that I’d bought in the Cambridge market for £3 [with] a [dark velvet] jacket that my sister had sent me, which was a Donna Karan second and it only had one shoulder pad. So while I was doing the song, I had to remember to lift my left shoulder slightly to even it out with the other&quot;. She also wore black leather trousers and black high-heeled boots.

The Eurovision performance of &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; was simply staged with Leskanich singing center stage fronting background vocalists Beverley Skeete and Miriam Stockley: Skeete and Stockley, respectively dark-haired and blonde and clad in long dark dresses, also provided accompaniment with tambourines and handclaps. Two of Leskanich&#x27;s co-members in Katrina and the Waves: drummer, Alex Cooper, and bassist, Vince de la Cruz (on this occasion playing guitar), were positioned towards the right side of the stage, while Phil Nicholl played bass stage left.
Phil Nicholl was not a permanent member of Katrina and the Waves being a substitute for the group&#x27;s regular guitarist – and the song&#x27;s composer – Kimberley Rew, who Leskanich would later state had disassociated himself from the group&#x27;s participating with his song in Eurovision. Don Airey, who played as a session musician on the single recording of the song, arranged and conducted the live version for Katrina &amp; The Waves. He added strings, brass and a vibrato flute, giving the song a more anthemic feel.

===Eurovision scoring===
In a pre-performance interview on the night of the Eurovision finale Leskanich had stated that Katrina and the Waves winning Eurovision was &quot;more than a dream – it&#x27;s probably going to be a reality. I mean we wouldn&#x27;t come here unless we were intending to win...For Eurovision [success] you need a song with a universal message, lighters in the air, Coca-Cola, heartwarming positive &#x27;all-unite&#x27; [message]...[Our] song has a universality about it that unites everyone and I think people are looking for that message in Eurovision...they want something uplifting and positive, and I think once in a while a song comes along that says Eurovision and I think that&#x27;s what &#x27;Love Shine a Light&#x27; says and I&#x27;m just lucky that I&#x27;m the one that gets to sing it.&quot;

&quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; did indeed win Eurovision 1997 easily: with its first 12-point score being awarded by Austria the fourth reporting jury &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; assumed permanent possession of first place on the scoreboard with its final vote tally an unprecedented 227 points besting the second-place entrant, the entrant for , &quot;Mysterious Woman&quot;, by 70 points. The final vote tally for &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; set a record unsurpassed until , when the introduction of the semi-final greatly expanded the number of countries voting in the final (indeed, entire top three polled more than 227 points that year). It also received the maximum 12 points from ten countries, a feat not matched until and not beaten until .

By a more directly comparable measure, &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; received an average of 9.458 points per country or 78.82% of total votes available, the third-highest in the history of the present voting system, behind only &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; by Brotherhood of Man in (9.647 points per jury, 80.39% of available points) and &quot;Ein bißchen Frieden&quot; by Nicole in (9.470 votes per jury, 78.91% of available points). Furthermore, the song received maximum points from ten of twenty-four countries (41.7%), the fourth highest of all time behind &quot;Euphoria&quot; by Loreen in (which received 12 points from eighteen of forty-one countries, or 43.9%), &quot;Non ho l&#x27;età&quot; by Gigliola Cinquetti in (receiving the then-maximum 5 points from eight of fifteen countries, or 53.3%) and &quot;Ein bißchen Frieden&quot; in 1982 (12 points from nine of seventeen countries, or 52.9%).

Katrina Leskanich commented that it was the second landslide of the week – the Labour Party led by Tony Blair had won the UK general election held two days earlier, on 1 May 1997.

===Aftermath===
In a 2009 interview Leskanich restated her opinion of &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot;: &quot;It was such a feel-good, lighters-in-the-air, cheesy number.&quot;, while adding: &quot;Our song was quickly forgotten because we didn&#x27;t have any sensational gimmick like Bucks Fizz&quot;. Leskanich also stated that Katrina and the Waves Eurovision victory boosted the group&#x27;s profile on the European cabaret circuit at the expense of their rock band credibility which heavily factored into the band&#x27;s 1999 breakup.

On 22 October 2005, Leskanich co-hosted the Eurovision fiftieth anniversary competition &quot;&quot;, held in Copenhagen, alongside Renārs Kaupers and sang her winning song in the opening sequence of the show with flag holders of all the nations who ever participated in Eurovision. The hosts of the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 –Sakis Rouvas and Maria Menounos– closed the opening act of its semi-final singing the song. A remix of the song was performed during the UK selection process final of 2008, &#x27;. In 2009, Leskanich performed it with the Dutch SuperVoices made up of 2000 Dutch choir singers. She also performed the song in UK&#x27;s Eurovision selection process &#x27; aired on BBC Four in 2016.

On 15 December 2019, Leskanich performed the song during &quot;Het Grote Songfestivalfeest&quot;, a Dutch live television concert programme starring artists of the Eurovision Song Contest as a prelude to the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 that had been scheduled to be held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands in May 2020. Following the 2020 contest&#x27;s cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the contest organisers subsequently organised the replacement show &quot;&quot;, whose title was inspired by the song. The song itself was performed during the show as an orchestral rendition by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, and again near the end of the show by all the artists set to take part in the cancelled contest (with the exception of Hooverphonic from Belgium), with Leskanich finishing.

==Critical reception==
British magazine &quot;Music Week&quot; rated &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; three out of five, writing, &quot;Though perfectly suited for Eurovision with its universal, everyone-come-together message, this anthemic-sounding song will require a decent competition performance to win over record buyers if it is to do anything chartwise.&quot;

<doc id="659171" wikidata="Q1139760" url="?curid=659171" title="Creswellian culture">
<text>The Creswellian is a British Upper Palaeolithic culture named after the type site of Creswell Crags in Derbyshire by Dorothy Garrod in 1926. It is also known as the British Late Magdalenian. According to Andreas Maier: &quot;In current research, the Creswellian and Hamburgian are considered to be independent but closely related entities which are rooted in the Magdalenian.&quot; The Creswellian is dated between 13,000 and 11,800 BP and was followed by the most recent ice age, the Younger Dryas, when Britain was at times unoccupied by humans.

==History==
The term Creswellian appeared for the first time in 1926 in Dorothy Garrod&#x27;s &quot;The Upper Palaeolithic Age in Britain&quot;. This was the first academic publication by the woman who in 1939 became the first woman ever to be elected as a professor at Cambridge. It is also the first monograph about the Upper Paleolithic of Britain at the national level and it remained the only one on the subject for half a century. Garrod suggested that the British variant of the Magdalenian industry is different enough to create a specific name:

The definition of Creswellian was refined since then and now refers exclusively, in the British context, to the Late Magdalenian-style industry.

==Description==

Diagnostic tools used to identify the period include trapezoidal backed blades called Cheddar points, variant forms known as Creswell points, and smaller bladelets. Other tool types include end scrapers made from long, straight blades. A special preparation technique was employed to remove blades from a core through striking in a single direction, leaving a distinct &#x27;spur&#x27; on the platform. The tools were made using a soft hammerstone or an antler hammer.

Other finds include Baltic amber, mammoth ivory and animal teeth and bone. These were used to make harpoons, awls, beads and needles. Unusual bevelled ivory rods, known as sagaies have been found at Gough&#x27;s Cave in Somerset and Kent&#x27;s Cavern in Devon.

Twenty eight sites producing Cheddar points are known in England and Wales though none have so far been found in Scotland or Ireland, regions which it is thought were not colonised by humans until later. Most sites are caves but there is increasing evidence for open air activity and that preferred sources of flint were exploited and that tools travelled distances of up to 100 miles from their sources. Some of the flint at Gough&#x27;s Cave came from the Vale of Pewsey in Wiltshire whilst non-local seashells and amber from the North Sea coast also indicate a highly mobile population. This matches evidence from the Magdelanian cultures elsewhere in Europe and may suggest that exchange of goods and the sending out of specialised expeditions seeking raw materials may have been practised. Analysis of debitage at occupation sites suggests that flint nodules were reduced in size at source and the lighter blades carried by Creswellian groups as &#x27;toolkits&#x27; in order to reduce the weight carried.

Comparison of flint from Kent&#x27;s Cavern and Creswell Crags has led some archaeologists to believe that they were made by the same group.

Food species eaten by Creswellian hunters focused on the wild horse (&quot;Equus ferus&quot;) or the red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;), probably depending on the season, although the Arctic hare, reindeer, mammoth, Saiga antelope, wild cow, brown bear, lynx, Arctic fox and wolf were also exploited.

Highly fragmentary fossil bones were found in Gough&#x27;s Cave at Cheddar. They had marks that suggested actions of skinning, dismembering, defleshing and marrow extraction. The excavations of 1986-1987 noted that human and animal remains were mixed, with no particular distribution or arrangement of the human bones. They also show the signs of the same treatments as the animal bones. These findings were interpreted in the sense of a nutritional cannibalism. However, slight differences from other sites in skull treatment leave open the possibility of elements of ritual cannibalism.

<text>Electronic benefit transfer (EBT) is an electronic system that allows state welfare departments to issue benefits via a magnetically encoded payment card used in the United States. It reached nationwide operations in 2004.

Benefits provided via EBT are of two types: food and cash. Food benefits are federally authorized benefits that can be used only to purchase food and non-alcoholic beverages. Food benefits are distributed through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly the Food Stamp Program, and the WIC program. Cash benefits include state general assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits, and refugee benefits. The average monthly EBT disbursement for SNAP is $211.45 per participant as of 2023.

==History==

Before the introduction of electronic benefit transfer (EBT), government benefit programs primarily relied on paper-based methods. The Food Stamp Program (FSP), for example, utilized color-coded paper coupons (&quot;stamps&quot;) that were redeemable at authorized retailers. Other programs, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), typically distributed benefits through mailed checks. These systems presented numerous challenges, including logistical complexities associated with printing, distributing, and processing paper documents, along with increased vulnerability to fraud, theft, and counterfeiting, all resulting in significant administrative costs.

The development of EBT began with pilot programs in the 1980s. In 1984, Reading, Pennsylvania, piloted the first program that used an EBT card for food stamp benefits. This initial experiment aimed to assess the feasibility and potential advantages of transitioning to an electronic system for the delivery of benefits. The Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 provided legislative authorization for further pilot projects to evaluate the use of benefit cards and automated systems. This exploratory phase continued with the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act of 1990, which formally recognized EBT as a viable alternative to paper-based methods and authorized further demonstration projects.

The 1990s witnessed growing momentum toward nationwide EBT implementation. The Conference Report accompanying the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 expressed strong federal support for state-level EBT development. Soon after, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) was passed, which made many significant changes to the US welfare system. One of the changes mandated that all states implement EBT systems by October 1, 2002, dramatically accelerating the shift from paper to electronic benefit distribution.

State agencies, private sector contractors, banks, and retailers collaborated to develop the necessary technological infrastructure, such as card processing networks and point-of-sale terminals, that could process the EBT card as a form of payment. To ensure the interoperability and portability of benefits across state lines, the Electronic Benefit Transfer Interoperability and Portability Act of 2000 established national standards for electronic benefit transactions. Puerto Rico, which transitioned to a block grant program (the Nutrition Assistance Program) in 1982, was exempted from these interoperability standards.

The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 further broadened the application of EBT by allowing group homes and institutions to directly redeem benefits electronically. By 2004, all U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia had implemented statewide EBT systems for administering SNAP benefits (the successor to the FSP).

The 2008 Farm Bill (Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008) formally changed the name of the Food Stamp Program to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and codified EBT as the standard method of benefit issuance. This legislation removed all references to &quot;stamps&quot; or &quot;coupons&quot; from federal law, replacing them with &quot;cards&quot; or &quot;EBT,&quot; thereby cementing the shift to electronic benefit delivery. The 2008 Farm Bill also addressed issues such as transaction fees and established programs to incentivize the purchase of healthy foods using SNAP benefits.

The Agricultural Act of 2014 enacted several SNAP-related changes impacting EBT. The law expanded retailer eligibility to include entities serving elderly and disabled individuals and direct-marketing agricultural producers, enabling home delivery pilot programs and direct-to-consumer sales. Other EBT-related provisions included restrictions on using SNAP for bottle/can refunds, mandates for retailer-funded EBT infrastructure (with exceptions), elimination of manual vouchers (except in emergencies), requirements for electronic sales restriction enforcement, expanded retailer approval based on food access, USDA oversight of excessive card replacements, and reporting requirements for state-operated restaurant meals programs for vulnerable populations.

The 2018 Farm Bill authorized the USDA&#x27;s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to conduct a mobile payment pilot for EBT in five states. In March 2023, the FNS announced the selection of Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Oklahoma for the pilot, enabling SNAP recipients in these states to use mobile payment technologies as an alternative to physical EBT cards.

In 2023, the payment industry began collaborating to revise the ISO standard governing EBT cards to enable the integration of EMV chip technology. This security enhancement is designed to mitigate the risk of fraud, particularly skimming attacks. In 2025, California and Oklahoma are slated to be the first states to implement this updated standard, transitioning to EBT cards equipped with EMV chip technology.

==Usage==

Through EBT, a recipient uses their EBT card at participating retailers to purchase food items authorized by the USDA&#x27;s SNAP program. Cash benefits may be used to purchase any item at a participating retailer, as well as to obtain cash-back or make a cash withdrawal from a participating ATM.

State agencies work with contractors to procure their own EBT systems for delivery of SNAP and other state-administered benefit programs. In the United States, all SNAP benefits are now being issued via EBT.

For example, recipients apply for their benefits in the usual way, by filling out a form at their local food stamp office or online. Once eligibility and level of benefits have been determined, information is transferred to the state&#x27;s EBT contractor. Once they are approved for benefits, an account is established in the recipient&#x27;s name, and their SNAP benefits are deposited electronically in this account each month. A plastic debit card is issued and a personal identification number (PIN) is assigned or chosen by the recipient to control access to their account. 

All states have systems that use magnetic stripe cards and &quot;online&quot; authorization of transactions. When paying for groceries, the SNAP customer&#x27;s card is run through an electronic reader or a point of sale terminal (POS), and the recipient enters the PIN to access the food stamp account. Then, electronically, the processor verifies the PIN and the account balance, and sends an authorization or denial back to the retailer. The recipient&#x27;s account is then debited for the amount of the purchase, and the retailer&#x27;s account is credited. No physical money changes hands. Payment is made to the retailer through an ACH settlement process at the end of the business day. Most states&#x27; online EBT systems are interoperable through the Quest network, which is sponsored by the Electronic Benefits and Services Council (formerly the EBT Council) of NACHA.

Many states stagger the issuing of benefits to EBT SNAP accounts, with the particular day of the month determined for each recipient based on the case number, Social Security number, or date of birth. The states of Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Vermont, along with Guam and the US Virgin Islands, credit accounts on the first of the month to all recipients, New Hampshire credits on the 5th, and South Dakota on the 10th.

== Taxation ==
It is illegal for anyone to charge sales tax, surcharges or card processing fees from an EBT SNAP account, according to federal law and USDA SNAP Guidelines. New state and federal law grants new provisions to law enforcement and state agencies to investigate the criminal use, including taxation on EBT purchases, of state and federal benefits.
