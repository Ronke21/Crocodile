<text>The Porsche 996 is the fifth generation of the 911 model sports car manufactured by the German automaker Porsche from 1997 until 2006. It was replaced by the 997 in 2004, but the high performance Turbo S, GT2 and GT3 variants remained in production until 2006. The 996 had little in common with its predecessor, with the first all new chassis platform since the original 911 and a new water-cooled engine. Technically, it was a major change, a complete break from the original car other than the overall layout.

The 996&#x27;s development was shared with the roadster-only Porsche Boxster (986) whose nameplate was making its debut as Porsche&#x27;s entry-level offering. The 986 was released shortly before the 996 for sales. Commonalities between the 996 and 986 included the front suspension, various interior components, and the engine, all of which were enlarged for the 996. However, the multi-link rear suspension was derived from the preceding 993. This was done mainly to save development costs as Porsche was facing financial troubles at that time. This move resulted in cost savings of approximately 30% in the development of the car.

At its debut, the 996 featured the most significant change from the classic 911 series: a water-cooled engine replacing the previously air-cooled engine. Progressively more stringent emissions and noise regulations, environmental concerns, a higher expectation for refinement and the need for a high-performance 4 valve per cylinder engine made the switch necessary. Other major changes include a completely new platform having a sleeker body with a more raked windshield, and a re-designed interior along with new &quot;fried egg&quot; shaped headlamps (so called due to the amber coloured turn signals) instead of previous &quot;bug eye&quot; headlamps.

==Design and history==
During the 1990s, Porsche was facing financial troubles and rumours of a proposed takeover were being spread. The signature air-cooled flat-6 of the 911 was reaching the limits of its potential as made evident by the 993. Stricter emissions regulations worldwide further forced Porsche to think of a replacement of the air-cooled unit. In order to improve manufacturing processes, Porsche took the aid of leading Japanese car manufacturer Toyota whose consultants would assist in the overhaul of the Zuffenhausen manufacturing facility introducing mass production techniques which would allow Porsche to carry out production processes more efficiently. Porsche had realised that in order to keep the 911 in production, it would need radical changes. This led to the development of the 996. The sharing of development between the new 911 and the entry level Boxster model allowed Porsche to save development costs. This move also resulted in interchangeable parts between the two models bringing down maintenance costs.

The Porsche 996 was a new design developed by Pinky Lai under Porsche design chief Harm Lagaay from 1992 to 2006; it was the first 911 that was completely redesigned, and carried over little from its predecessor as Porsche wanted the design team to design a 911 for the next millennium. Featuring an all new body, interior, and the first water-cooled engine, the 996 replaced the 993 from which only the front suspension, rear multi-link suspension, and a 6-speed manual transmission were retained in revised form. The 996 had a drag coefficient of resulting from hours spent in the wind tunnel. The 996 is longer and wider than its predecessor. It is also 45% stiffer courtesy of a chassis formed from high-strength steel. Additionally, it is lighter despite having additional radiators and coolant.


The 996 was initially available in a coupé or a cabriolet (Convertible) bodystyle with rear-wheel drive, and later with four-wheel drive, utilising a 3.4 litre flat-6 engine generating a maximum power output of . The 996 had the same front end as the entry-level Boxster. After requests from the Carrera owners about their premium cars looking like a &quot;lower priced car that looked just like theirs did&quot;, Porsche redesigned the headlamps of the Carrera in 2002 similar to the high performance Turbo&#x27;s headlamps. The design for the initial &quot;fried egg&quot; shaped headlamps could be traced back to the 1997 911 GT1 race car.

In 2000, Porsche introduced the 996 Turbo, equipped with a four-wheel-drive system and a 3.6-litre, twin-turbocharged and intercooled flat-six engine generating a maximum power output of , making the car capable of accelerating from in 4.2 seconds. An X50 option which included larger turbochargers and intercoolers along with revised engine control software became available from the factory in 2002, increasing power output to . In 2005, Porsche introduced the Turbo S, which had the X50 option included as standard equipment, with the formerly optional Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) composite ceramic brakes (PCCB) also included as standard.

In 2000, power output on the base Carrera model was increased to . 2001 marked the final year of production for the base Carrera 4 Coupé in narrow body format.

In 2002, the standard Carrera models underwent the above-mentioned facelift. In addition, engine capacity of the M96 engine was also increased to 3.6-litres across the range, yielding gains of for the naturally aspirated models. 2002 also marked the start of the production of the 996 based Targa model, with a sliding glass &quot;green house&quot; roof system as introduced on its predecessor. It also features a rear glass hatch which gave the driver access to the storage compartment. Also in 2002, the Carrera 4S model was first introduced. The C4S, as it is called among the enthusiasts, shares the wide-body look of the Turbo as well as the brakes and suspension.
==Turbo==
The 996 Turbo debuted at the Frankfurt Auto show in September 1999 and went on sale in the US in summer of 2000 as a 2001 model. The Turbo is powered by a water-cooled twin-turbocharged and intercooled 3.6-litre flat-6 engine derived from the 1998 Le Mans winning 911 GT1 race car. The engine is rated at at 6,000 rpm and of torque. It features an all-wheel drive system and was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed Tiptronic transmission. It has revised styling and a wider stance than the naturally aspirated 996 Carrera models, along with new bi-xenon headlamps and a retractable rear wing. The Turbo also came with VarioCam Plus and stability management, and on the US models, an electronically adjustable rear spoiler was included which would rise at a speed of and lower at . The bodywork was also revised to allow airflow to 3 radiators up front and to accommodate 18-inch wheels and tyres.

In 2002, the X50 package was offered as an option on the Turbo that included larger K24 turbochargers and intercoolers, a revised ECU and quad-pipe exhaust which raised power output to . Other features introduced in 2002 were a glove box, center mounted cup-holders, an optional Bose stereo and rain-sensing wipers.

In 2003, Porsche North America restated their horsepower numbers due to SAE changes. The Turbo was still listed at 415 hp, however the X50 option was now listed at 444 hp.

The Turbo Cabriolet was introduced for the 2004 model year which was the first mass-produced Turbo Cabriolet model since the 1989 930 Turbo Cabriolet.

In 2005, Porsche introduced the Turbo S model available as either a coupé or cabriolet. The Turbo S was essentially a 996 Turbo with the X50 option but also included PCCB, 6-disc CD changer and aluminum-faced instruments.
==GT variants==
The 996 platform was used as the basis for two lightweight GT variants called the GT2 and the GT3. The GT3 was based on the standard 996 Carrera, but was stripped of a great deal of equipment for weight savings, featuring stiffer, adjustable suspension and upgraded brakes. The GT3 used the bodyshell of the four-wheel-drive Carrera 4, which incorporated additional front-end stiffening. The GT3 was produced in two versions. The first, commonly referred to as the Mk.I GT3, was introduced in 1999 in all markets, except North America. It featured a naturally aspirated 3.6-litre flat-six engine generating a maximum power output of . This engine was shared with the 996 Turbo and was a derivative of the engine developed for the 911 GT1 race car. The Mk.II GT3 variant was based on the second generation of the 996, and featured updated aerodynamics, and a more powerful version of the 3.6 L engine from the MK.I, now rated at . The Mk.II was the first GT3 marketed in the North America. An Mk.II GT3 was tested in 2004 and accelerated from in 4.0 seconds, and produced 1.03 g on the skidpad, the second highest number ever recorded by a street-legal vehicle at the time.

The turbocharged counterpart to the GT3, the GT2, was rear-wheel drive as well, to save weight and to avoid power losses through the transmission (This is primarily due to the fact that the GT2 was built to compete in GT2 class racing, which restricted the use of an all-wheel-drive system). The GT2 received an added group of aerodynamic body parts, and a re-tuned version of the 996 Turbo&#x27;s 3.6 litre, twin-turbocharged engine featuring larger turbochargers and intercoolers, a revised intake and exhaust system and re-programmed engine control software. The result was at 5,700 rpm and at 3,500 to 4,500 rpm, enough to launch the car from in 3.9 seconds and to a top speed of . Bigger wheels and tyres along with lightweight ceramic brakes were standard. The GT2&#x27;s fixed rear wing (made of CFRP for the post-2003 cars) appears to be a concession to racing rules that usually outlaw adjustable aerodynamic components. The GT2 had no rear seat and no air conditioning and came with a factory installed roll cage. Both the GT3 and GT2 were available only with a 6-speed manual transmission.

The Turbo, GT2 and GT3 models use the Aluminum crankcase of the air-cooled 911 with its true dry sump oiling system. The six separate individual Nikasil lined cylinders in this engine are covered with two separately installed water jackets each covering a bank of 3 cylinders on each side of the engine, thus adding water cooling to a crankcase originally designed for air-cooled cylinders (the standard 996 Carrera engine has the cylinders and water jackets cast together with the crankcase).
==Special editions==

Porsche offered a special edition of the 996 for the year 2000. The car, named the 911 Millennium edition was based on the Carrera 4 coupé. Only 911 cars were made. It came with polished “turbo look” wheels.

This special edition was finished in Violet Chromaflair paint with natural leather interior and dark burr maple trim. The car was available with a Tiptronic or six-speed manual gearbox. A number plate on the center console and a unique &quot;911&quot; badge on the engine lid and lettering on the door sills make this special edition easy to identify from other base Carrera models.

Porsche celebrated the 911&#x27;s 40-year history in 2003, using the slogan, &quot;40 Jahre 911/40 Years of the 911&quot;. The company also introduced the 996 &quot;40th Anniversary Edition&quot; for model year 2004. This model has the 996 Turbo&#x27;s front-end, and was available only in GT Silver metallic paint. Other unique features included: X51 power kit, turbo radiators, limited slip differential, sport suspension, polished 5-spoke alloy wheels (unique to this model), GT3 side skirts, natural gray leather interior (with matching luggage set), sports seats (there was a power comfort seat option), polished exhaust tips, heated seats (option in Latin America), litronic bi-xenon headlights, special dynamic sealed panels, and a special &quot;40 Jahre 911&quot; logo on the engine cover. The power was increased to . Only 1,963 units were made, to commemorate 1963—the year in which the 911 was first introduced.
==Mechanical issues==
The Porsche 911 996 model equipped with the engine code M96.01 and M96.02 3.4 liter engines and M96.03 and M96.04 3.6 liter engines, produced between 1998 and 2005, is known for some mechanical issues including problems with the rear main seal (RMS), cylinder cracking, slipped sleeves, and bore scoring, and last, the intermediate shaft (IMS) bearing. The rear main seal issue in some models was due to improper machining, requiring engine replacement to correct for chronic RMS leaks. However, Porsche did redesign the rear main seal and the most current PTFE seal addresses most RMS issues. Some early 996 engined M96.01 and M96.02 3.4 liter models were sleeved from the factory to correct for manufacturing issues, however some of these sleeves can drop, referred to as a slipped sleeve failure. Cracked or scored cylinders are also common with the 996&#x27;s 3.4 and 3.6 liter engines that can result in intermix of the engine oil and coolant, or in the case of bore scoring, excessive piston noise, oil consumption, and smoking can occur. The most well-known 996 M96.01 and M96.02 3.4 liter and M96.03 and M96.04 3.6 liter engine issues is that of the intermediate shaft bearing, which was the subject of The Eisen class action lawsuit. IMS failure rates of up to 8% were disclosed during the discovery process. These mechanical issues do not apply to the Hans Mezger designed Mezger GT3, Turbo, and GT2 engine models.

==Individual vehicles==

===Movie character===

Hollywood custom car builder Eddie Paul created a modified 996 Carrera as one of a set of three vehicles for Pixar&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Cars&quot; promotional tour. Sally, a blue Porsche 996 designed to closely resemble a 2002 Carrera, is built on a slightly shortened wheelbase; her windshield is tilted closer to vertical (adding a few inches to the car&#x27;s height) to accommodate the animated character&#x27;s eyes. The vehicle is currently held in the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.

===Police car===
In 2007, a motorist&#x27;s 2001 Porsche 911 was searched during a traffic stop by Hoover, Alabama police. The police department seized the vehicle after they found 10 kilograms of cocaine hidden inside two compartments. Since then the vehicle was redecorated in two-tone police blue with a wing, light bar, and rear window lights. The vehicle was unveiled in 2009 as a Hoover Police Department police car and has appeared at various public events.

<doc id="642502" wikidata="Q1542360" url="?curid=642502" title="Egerton Gospel">
<text>The Egerton Gospel (British Library Egerton Papyrus 2) refers to a collection of three papyrus fragments of a codex of a previously unknown gospel, found in Egypt and sold to the British Museum in 1934; the physical fragments are now dated to the very end of the 2nd century CE. Together they comprise one of the oldest surviving witnesses to any gospel, or any codex. The British Museum lost no time in publishing the text: acquired in the summer of 1934, it was in print in 1935. It is also called the Unknown Gospel, as no ancient source makes reference to it, in addition to being entirely unknown before its publication.

==Provenance==
Three fragments of the manuscript form part of the Egerton Collection in the British Library. A fourth fragment of the same manuscript was identified in the papyrus collection of the University of Cologne, and published in 1987.

The provenance of the four fragments is a matter of some dispute. Throughout the 20th century the provenance of the Egerton fragments was kept anonymous, with the initial editors suggesting without proof that they came from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri. In 2019 it was established that they were purchased in 1934 from Maurice Nahman, an antiquities dealer in Cairo. Nahman purchased the manuscript sometime between the 1920s and 1934, without recording its origin. Nahman bragged that he had many origins for his manuscripts. The Oxyrhynchus identification is thus in question. The Cologne fragment was deposited without any provenance whatsoever. Circumstantial evidence suggests that this was purchased from Nahman&#x27;s estate at the time of his death in 1954.

Colin Henderson Roberts reported seeing an account of the Passion of Jesus in Nahman&#x27;s collection. Other Biblical scholars urgently pursued this missing fragment, but Nahman&#x27;s collection was sold off indiscriminately to many different European universities and private collectors. The names of buyers were not recorded and the final whereabouts of this fragment, if it exists, are unknown.

==Contents==
The surviving fragments include four stories:

# A controversy similar to John 5:39–47 and 10:31–39;
# Curing a leper similar to Matthew 8:1–4, Mark 1:40–45, Luke 5:12–16 and 17:11–14;
# A controversy about paying tribute to Caesar analogous to Matthew 22:15–22, Mark 12:13–17 and Luke 20:20–26; and;
# An incomplete account of a miracle on the Jordan River bank, perhaps carried out to illustrate the parable about seeds growing miraculously.

The latter story has no equivalent in canonical Gospels:

==Dating the manuscript==
The date of the manuscript is established through palaeography (the comparison of writing styles) alone. When the Egerton fragments were first published, its date was estimated at around 150 CE; implying that, of early Christian papyri it would be rivalled in age only by , the John Rylands Library fragment of the Gospel of John. Later, when an additional papyrus fragment of the Egerton Gospel text was identified in the University of Cologne collection (Papyrus Köln 255) and published in 1987, it was found to fit on the bottom of one of the British Library papyrus pages. In this additional fragment a single use of a hooked apostrophe in between two consonants was observed, a practice that became standard in Greek punctuation at the beginning of the 3rd century; this sufficed to revise the date of the Egerton manuscript. This study placed the manuscript to around the time of Bodmer Papyri , ; noting that Eric Turner had palaeographically dated as around 200 CE, citing use of the hooked apostrophe in that papyrus in support of this date.

The revised dating for the Egerton Papyrus continues to carry wide support. However, Stanley Porter has reviewed the dating of the Egerton Papyrus alongside that of ; noting that the scholarly consensus dating the former to the turn of the third century and the latter to the first half of the second century was contra-indicated by close palaeographic similarities of the two manuscripts. The 1987 redating of the Egerton Papyrus had rested on a comment made by Eric Turner in 1971:

Porter notes that Turner had then nevertheless advanced several earlier dated examples of the practice from the later second century, and one (BGU III 715.5) is dated to 101 CE. Porter proposes that, notwithstanding the discovery of the hooked apostrophe in P. Köln 255, the original editors&#x27; proposal of a mid second century date for the Egerton Papyrus accords better with the palaeographic evidence of dated comparator documentary and literary hands for both and this papyrus &quot;the middle of the second century, perhaps tending towards the early part of it&quot;.

==Date of composition==
Jon B. Daniels writes the following in his introduction in &quot;The Complete Gospels:&quot;

Such traditional sayings are posited for the hypothetical Q Document. Ronald Cameron states:

Scholar François Bovon observes that the Egerton fragments &quot;sound very Johannine&quot; but also includes a number of terms characteristic of the Gospel of Luke, and is especially similar to Luke 5:12–14 and Luke 17:14, a conclusion also shared by scholar Tobias Nicklas.

Helmut Koester and J. D. Crossan have argued that despite its apparent historical importance, the text is not well known. It is a mere fragment, and does not bear a clear relationship to any of the four canonical gospels. The Egerton Gospel has been largely ignored outside a small circle of scholars. The work cannot be dismissed as &quot;apocrypha&quot; or &quot;heretical&quot; without compromising the orthodoxy of the Gospel of John. Nor can it be classed as &quot;gnostic&quot; and dismissed as marginal. It seems to be almost independent of the synoptic gospels and to represent a tradition similar to the canonical John, but independent of it. Additionally, it tells of an otherwise unknown miracle in the Johannine manner.

Evangelical scholar Craig Evans supports a date for the Egerton Gospel later than the canonical gospels in a variety of ways. He finds many parallels between the Egerton Gospel and the canonical gospels that include editorial language particular to Matthew and Luke. While Koester argues that these show a tradition before the other gospels, Craig Evans sees these as drawing from the other gospels just as Justin Martyr did. He also finds words such as the plural &quot;priests&quot; that show lack of knowledge of Jewish customs.

<text>&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; is a military science fiction television series created by Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner. The series resumes the story of the 1994 &quot;Stargate&quot; film, where a military team led by Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill and supported by the archeologist Daniel Jackson use an ancient alien artifact called the Stargate to travel to a planet where an alien named Ra oppressed the planet&#x27;s people by posing as a god. After the Earth team defeated Ra, O&#x27;Neil returns to Earth while Daniel Jackson stays on the planet. The series pilot, which takes place roughly one year after the events of the film, reveals that Ra was not the only alien to use Stargates to transport human slaves to many worlds for thousands of years.

&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; premiered on July 27, 1997, on the subscription channel Showtime. After five seasons on the same network, the Sci Fi Channel bought &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and would air it for five further seasons, totalling to 214 episodes in ten seasons (seasons 1 through 7 consisted of 22 episodes each, and seasons 8 through 10 had 20 episodes each). Since the American broadcast splits each season to allow the production to catch up, the British channel Sky One aired the second part of some seasons before their American counterpart. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;&#x27;s finale episode premiered in the United Kingdom on Sky One on March 13, 2007. The Sci Fi Channel concluded the tenth season on June 22, 2007. All seasons of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; are available on DVD, and two direct-to-DVD &quot;Stargate&quot; films have continued the series, the first released in March 2008, the second in July 2008.

The cast of the first five seasons consisted of Richard Dean Anderson starring as Col. Jack O&#x27;Neill, Michael Shanks as Dr. Daniel Jackson, Amanda Tapping as Cpt./Maj. Samantha Carter (who would be promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel in Season 8 and to Colonel in the films), Christopher Judge as the Jaffa alien Teal&#x27;c, and Don S. Davis as Maj. Gen. George Hammond. Michael Shanks left the series after Season 5, and his function was assumed by Corin Nemec as the non-earth human Jonas Quinn in Season 6. Shanks continued to have a recurring role in season 6, rejoined the cast in Season 7, and stayed part of the main cast until the series&#x27; end. After Don S. Davis&#x27; departure from &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; after Season 7, Richard Dean Anderson&#x27;s character was promoted to Brigadier General in Season 8; Anderson left the series&#x27; main cast after that season, but continued to appear periodically. Ben Browder and Beau Bridges replaced them as Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell and Maj. Gen. Hank Landry in Season 9, respectively. The last actor to join the main cast was Claudia Black, who resumed her previously recurring role as Vala Mal Doran in Season 9.

After the SciFi Channel&#x27;s decision to not renew &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in 2006, the &quot;SG-1&quot; producers and rights-holder MGM expressed a desire to continue &quot;SG-1&quot; as a movie, mini-series, or an 11th season on another network. Brad Wright confirmed the production of two direct-to-DVD films in October 2006, which eventually became &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. A special edition of the two-hour pilot episode &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; with re-edited scenes, all new visual effects, and a new score by Joel Goldsmith was released in July 2009. In April 2009, MGM confirmed a third new &quot;SG-1&quot; film that Brad Wright had first announced in May 2008. However, this last project (entitled &quot;&quot;) was put on hold and eventually got shelved permanently in 2011.

<doc id="642519" wikidata="Q1641241" url="?curid=642519" title="Battle of Guadalajara">
<text>The Battle of Guadalajara (March 8–23, 1937) saw the victory of the Spanish Republican Army (&quot;Ejército Popular Republicano&quot;, or EPR) and of the International Brigades over the Italian and Nationalist forces attempting to encircle Madrid during the Spanish Civil War. The Nationalist forces involved in the Battle of Guadalajara were primarily the Italian Corps of Volunteer Troops (&quot;Corpo Truppe Volontarie&quot;, or CTV).

The battle opened with an Italian offensive on 8 March. This offensive was halted by 11 March. Between 12 and 14 March, renewed Italian attacks were supported by Spanish Nationalist units. These were halted too. On 15 March, a Republican counter-offensive was prepared. The Republicans successfully launched their counter-offensive from 18–23 March.

==Background==

After the collapse of the third offensive on Madrid, Spanish Nationalist General Francisco Franco decided to continue with a fourth offensive aimed at closing the pincer around the capital. The Nationalist forces, after a defeat at the Battle of Jarama, were exhausted and could not create the necessary momentum to carry the operation through. However, the Italians were optimistic after the capture of Málaga, and it was thought that the Italian forces could score an easy victory owing to the heavy losses sustained by the People&#x27;s Republican Army at Jarama. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini endorsed the operation and committed Italian units to it.

The Italian commander, General Mario Roatta, planned to surround the defences of Madrid from the north-east. After joining the Spanish Nationalist corps &quot;Madrid&quot; on the Jarama River, they would begin the assault on Madrid. The Italian forces would execute the main attack. The Spanish division &quot;Soria&quot; was present to secure the operation, but played no part in the first five days of fighting. The main attack began in the 25 km-wide pass at Guadalajara-Alcalá de Henares. This region was well suited for an advance, as there were five roads of high quality running through it. Three other roads in the area led to Guadalajara, allowing for the possibility of capturing this town as well. The Nationalist forces had 35,000 soldiers, 222 artillery pieces, 108 L3/33 tankettes and L3/35 tankettes, 32 armoured cars, 3,685 motor vehicles, and 60 Fiat CR.32 fighter planes. The Italian tankettes and armoured cars were organized as the &quot;Tank and Armoured Cars Group&quot; (&quot;Agrupación de carros de asalto y autos blindados&quot;). The Italian aircraft were organized into the &quot;Legionary Air Force&quot; (&quot;Aviazione Legionaria&quot;).

The Republican presence in the Guadalajara region consisted only of the 12th Division of the People&#x27;s Republican Army under Colonel Lacalle. He had under his command 10,000 soldiers with 5,900 rifles, 85 machine guns, and 15 artillery pieces. One company of T-26 light tanks were also sent to the area. No defensive works had been constructed in the Guadalajara region, because it was regarded as a peaceful part of the front. The People&#x27;s Republican Army staff was sure that the next Fascist offensive would come from the south.

==Italian offensive==

===March 8===
After 30 minutes&#x27; artillery fire and air raids on the Republican positions, the Italians began advancing towards the 50th Republican brigade. Led by tankettes, they broke through the Republican line. Their assault then slowed, mainly because fog and sleet had reduced visibility down to in places. The Italians captured 10 to 12 km of terrain, including the towns of Mirabueno, Alaminos and Castejon. Falling back, the Republican commander requested infantry reinforcements and the company of tanks.

===March 9===

The Nationalists continued their assault on Republican positions. The main attack was carried out with tanks but again bogged down from poor performance and low visibility. The Republican 50th Brigade escaped without a fight. At about noon, the Italian advance was suddenly turned back by battalions of the XI International Brigade (battalions involved were initially the Edgar André Battalion, Thälmann Battalion and Commune de Paris Battalion – with soldiers mainly from Germany, France, and the Balkan countries). The Italians on the Nationalist side had taken another 15 to 18 km and the towns of Almadrones, Cogollor, and Masegoso. In the evening, the first formations of Italian troops reached the suburb of Brihuega, where they halted to await a wider breach in the Republican lines. This break in momentum, though incompatible with the &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; tactics they were nominally following, was under the circumstances necessary to allow the soldiers to rest.

The Republican forces on this day consisted of the XI International Brigade, two artillery batteries and two companies of infantry from the 49th Brigade, 12th Division. They had 1,850 soldiers with 1,600 rifles, 34 machine guns, 6 artillery pieces, and 5 tanks. By the end of the day, reinforcements started to arrive as Colonel Enrique Jurado Barrio was ordered to form IV Corps with Líster&#x27;s 11th Division in the center at the Madrid–Zaragoza road at Torija, the 12th Division on the left flank, and the 14th Division on the right. Vicente Rojo ordered the 2nd Assault Guard Division into action.

===March 10===
The Republican forces received new reinforcements: Italians and Poles from the XII International Brigade (two battalions; Jarosław Dabrowski Battalion and Giuseppe Garibaldi Battalion), three artillery batteries, and an understrength battalion of tanks. The Republican forces now had 4,350 soldiers, 8 mortars, 16 artillery pieces, and 26 light tanks.

In the morning, Italian forces on the Nationalist side launched heavy artillery and air bombardments and without success began the assault on the XI International Brigade. At that point they had committed 26,000 soldiers, 900 machine guns, 130 light tanks, and a large number of artillery pieces. The Nationalists captured the towns Miralrio and Brihuega. The latter town fell almost without opposition.

Nationalist attacks on XI and XII International Brigades continued in the afternoon, still without success. At Torija, the Nationalists faced the Italian Garibaldi Battalion. Italians in the Garibaldi Battalion encouraged the Fascist soldiers to join the Republicans. The attacks halted toward evening, and the Italian Nationalists built defensive positions.

At the end of the day, Lacalle resigned his command, officially for health reasons, but probably because of his resentment at being passed over by Jurado. Command of 12th Division went to the Italian communist Nino Nanetti.

===March 11===
The Italians began a successful advance on the positions of XI and XII International Brigades, who retreated down the main road. The Italian vanguard stopped 3 km before the town of Torija. The Spanish Nationalist division &quot;Soria&quot; captured the towns of Hita and Torre del Burgo.

==Republican counterattacks==

===March 12===

The Republican forces under Líster&#x27;s command redeployed in the morning and launched a counterattack at noon. Close to one-hundred &quot;Chato&quot; and &quot;Rata&quot; fighter planes and two squadrons of Katiuska bombers of the Spanish Republican Air Force had been made available at the Albacete airfield. While the aircraft of the Italian Legionary Air Force were grounded on water-logged airports, the Republicans did not have this problem since the Albacete airfield had a concrete strip.

After an air bombardment of the Italian positions, the Republican infantry supported by T-26 and BT-5 light tanks attacked the Italian lines. Several Italian tankettes were lost when General Roatta attempted to change the position of his motorized units in the muddy terrain; many got stuck and were easy target for strafing fighters. The advance reached Trijueque. An Italian counterattack did not regain lost terrain.

===March 13===
The Republican counterattack on Trijueque and Casa del Cabo, Palacio de Ibarra was launched with some success. The plan under Vicente Rojo was to concentrate 11th Division under Líster and all armoured units on the Zaragoza road, while 14th Division under Mera crossed the Tajuña River to attack Brihuega. The Italians were warned that this might happen, but ignored advice from the Spanish chief of operations, Colonel Barroso.

===March 14–17===
On March 14, most Republican infantry formations rested while their air forces executed successful attacks. The International Brigade captured the &quot;Palacio de Ibarra&quot;. In the subsequent days the Republicans redeployed and concentrated their forces.

The Republican forces now consisted of some 20,000 soldiers, 17 mortars, 28 artillery pieces, 60 light tanks and 70 planes.

The Italian and Spanish Nationalist forces consisted of some 45,000 soldiers, 70 mortars, 200 artillery pieces, 80 light tanks (L3 tankettes), and 50 planes.
===March 18===
At dawn, Vicente Rojo gave the orders and Mera led the 14th Division across the pontoon bridge over the Tajuña River. They had cover from heavy sleet, but the weather also delayed the assault. After midday, the weather had improved enough to allow the Republican air force to operate. At around 13:30, Jurado gave the order to attack. Líster was slowed by the Italian Littorio Division, largely considered to be the best of the Italian units. The 14th Division managed to surround Brihuega, and the Italians retreated in panic. The remaining Italian soldiers were cleared out by the Assault Guards and XI International Brigade.

An Italian counterattack on Republican positions failed and was repulsed by the Assault Guard Division, arguably the best of the Spanish Republican units. The attack by the Assault Guard Division was spearheaded by the 1st Assault Brigade to devastating effect, inflicting heavy losses on the Italians. The Littorio Division saved the Italians from a complete disaster when they conducted a well-organized retreat.

===March 19–23===
The Republican forces recaptured the cities of Gajanejos and Villaviciosa de Tajuña. Their counter-offensive was ultimately halted on the Valdearenas–Ledanca–Hontanares line, because Franco had sent reserve formations to settle the line of defence between Ledanca and Hontanares.

==Aftermath==

The Battle of Guadalajara was an important strategic victory of the Republican Army and did much to lift morale. Herbert Matthews claimed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Guadalajara was &quot;to Fascism what the defeat at Bailén had been to Napoleon.&quot; The British press heaped scorn on this &quot;new Caporetto&quot;—alluding to a great Italian defeat in the First World War—while former British prime minister David Lloyd George wrote mockingly of the &quot;Italian skedaddle,&quot; infuriating Mussolini.

The Italian CTV lost some 3,000 men (Spanish Nationalist losses were marginal) and a considerable number of light tanks. In addition, the Republican army captured sizeable quantities of badly-needed materiel, including 65 artillery pieces, 500 machine guns, 67 trucks and vehicles, 13 mortars, 10 tanks, and plenty of ammunition. Strategically, the Republican victory prevented the encirclement of Madrid, ending Franco&#x27;s hopes of crushing the Republic with a decisive strike at its capital. Franco decided to adopt a new strategy of chipping away at the Republican territories, starting in the north.

Above all, Guadalajara was a setback to Italian morale and a loss of prestige for Italy&#x27;s fascist regime, whose &quot;Duce&quot; had orchestrated the deployment of the Italian army in the hopes of stunning the world with a show of Italy&#x27;s &quot;iron military strength.&quot; In response, Franco (who feared CTV strategic independence, especially after the Italian victory at Malaga) announced his intention to dismantle the Italian field army in Spain, seeking to disperse it among Spanish Nationalist units. This threat was not ultimately carried out and Guadalajara in a sense guaranteed and continued Italian aid as Mussolini sought final victory to efface his humiliation at Guadalajara.

Franco, who was uncomfortable with the prospect of the CTV successfully crushing the Republic forces by itself (he believed this would give the impression that the fall of Madrid was wholly creditable to a foreign army) brimmed with &quot;Schadenfreude&quot; over his allies&#x27; humiliation. Officers in General Moscardó&#x27;s HQ raised a toast to &quot;Spanish heroism, of whatever colour&quot;—probably the only time Nationalist forces toasted a Republican triumph of arms. Franco&#x27;s soldiers began singing popular Italian tunes with lyrical changes mocking the defeated CTV. The following chorus, originating with Moscardó&#x27;s Navarrese, humorously takes the Italians to task for their earlier complaints about the lack of motorized transport in Nationalist ranks:

The CTV may have lost the battle because Franco did not start a side offensive, from Jarama toward Alcalà de Henares, as agreed on March 1 with General Roatta. After seeing that the Nationalists were not attacking, the Republicans were able to redeploy the troops facing Jarama to meet the Italian offensive. Later, when faced by General Roatta, Franco tried to excuse himself saying that his Generals ignored his orders to advance. It is possible he used the Italian troops as cannon fodder to gain time to regroup his troops, exhausted after Jarama. This is explained by the Franco&#x27;s fear towards the Italians and their attitude to win the war &quot;alone&quot;, forcing the Caudillo&#x27;s war leadership. This also explains the ungrateful songs against the Italians which despite all were decisively contributing with personnel and equipment to the nationalist cause.

===Analysis===
British historian Paul Preston identified factors contributing to the Italian debacle:

*The tenacity of Republican resistance. Deceived by the easy triumph of their mechanized columns over underarmed and panic-stricken Republican militias at Málaga, the Italians underestimated the quality and organization of Republican forces defending Madrid
*Inadequate preparation of the Italians—many wearing colonial uniforms—to conditions of heavy snow and sleet
*Lack of paved runways for Italian aviation, which left CTV craft sunken in muddy airfields and prey to Republican aviation
*Overall inaction of Nationalist forces on the Jarama front (a delayed, modest attack was launched on March 9), allowing the Republicans to concentrate additional forces along the Guadalajara
*The superiority of Russian T-26 tanks, equipped with rotating gun turrets, over Italian tankettes
*Roatta&#x27;s failure—which Preston describes as grossly negligent—to entrench the Italian corps along its new positions in anticipation of a Republican counterattack

The minimal success of the Italian offensive demonstrated the vulnerability of massed armored advances in unfavorable terrain and against a coherent infantry defense. The French General Staff, in harmony with existing beliefs in the French Army, concluded that mechanized troops were not decisive in modern warfare and continued to shape military doctrine accordingly. An exception was Charles de Gaulle. The Germans incorrectly ascribed the Guadalajara failure to leadership and planning. The German attaché to the CTV praised the combat attitude of the Italian troops.

In truth, both views have merit: armoured forces were largely ineffective against deep prepared defenses; in adverse weather, and without enough air support, the result was disaster (Italian strategists failed to consider these variables). But the German assessment noted the deficiencies in Italian weaponry, planning, and organization that contributed to the defeat at Guadalajara. In particular, vehicles and tanks lacked the technical quality, and leaders the determination, to effect the violent breakthroughs characteristic of later German blitzkrieg tactics.

==Geography==
The district includes the urban communities of Dartmouth and Cole Harbour in Halifax. The area is .

==Political geography==
The Liberals and the NDP were the two main parties in 2008. The NDP saw much of its support in West Dartmouth, around Topsail Lake, the northern part of Cole Harbour, and the communities of Imperoyal and Woodside as well as the Cole Harbour 30 Indian Reserve. The Conservatives won two polls, both in Cole Harbour. The Liberals dominated in Central, Eastern and Northern Dartmouth and in southern Cole Harbour. 

==History==
The riding of Dartmouth—Halifax East was created in 1966 when the former dual-member Halifax riding was split into two. The district consisted of the Dartmouth area, Bedford and most of eastern Halifax County. Bedford was moved to the riding of Halifax West in a 1976 redistribution. In 1987, the Dartmouth riding was created, taking in nearly all of the former territory of Dartmouth—Halifax East.

The electoral district of Dartmouth—Cole Harbour in 2004 was created from 86.8% of the population of the new riding came from Dartmouth, and 13.2% from Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore.

The 2012 federal electoral redistribution concluded that this riding will remain largely the same for the 42nd Canadian federal election. It lost a small fraction to the new riding of Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook and gained a small portion (2%) from what was Sackville—Eastern Shore.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will gain the Eastern Passage area from Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook, and will lose all of the area north of Highways 111 and 118 plus the Lake Charles area to Sackville—Bedford—Preston.

<text>Gustaf Oscar Augustin Montelius, known as Oscar Montelius (9September 18434November 1921) was a Swedish archaeologist who refined the concept of seriation, a relative chronological dating method.

== Biography ==
Oscar Montelius refined the concept of typology, a relative chronological dating method. Typology is the procedure of working out a chronology by arranging material remains of a cultural tradition in the order that produces the most consistent patterning of their cultural traits. Typologies are the basis for seriation, a technique developed by English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie (1853–1942) based on his excavations in Egypt.

Montelius&#x27; impetus was at first to provide relative dates for artifacts in museum collections that often lacked rigorous records, by making comparisons with other artifacts within a comparable geographical area. Montelius&#x27; method created a timeline specific to the location, based on material remains. Later, when combined with written historical references, objects could be provided absolute dates.
He took the three-age system (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age), originally devised by Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen (1788–1865) to organize Danish museum collections of archaeological materials, and sub-divided it further. He divided the Neolithic in Scandinavia into four numbered periods, I-IV, and the Nordic Bronze Age into six I-VI. He was the first to establish that the numerous Swedish petroglyphs were from the Nordic Bronze Age, by comparing axes portrayed in the petroglyphs with archaeological finds. Further he supported Thomsen&#x27;s typology of gold bracteates from the migration period.

By taking calendrical dates from the recently deciphered hieroglyphics of Ancient Egypt, Montelius employed a complex system of cross-dating through typologies and associated finds to apply absolute dates to archaeological finds and features all over Europe.
His diffusionist theories were eventually displaced by more complex views of cultural interaction but following refinement his system of sub-divisions is still effectively in use. Montelius was made a member of the Swedish Academy in 1917.

==Personal life==
Oscar Montelius was married to Swedish philanthropist and feminist Agda Montelius née Reuterskiöld (1850–1920). They are buried in a dolmen grave (a type of grave that was common in Sweden during the Nordic Bronze Age) in Norra begravningsplatsen in Solna, Sweden.

<text>Fredericton (formerly Fredericton—York—Sunbury) is a federal electoral district in New Brunswick, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1988. Its population in 2021 was 87,436. Its predecessor riding, York—Sunbury, was represented in the House of Commons from 1917 to 1988. 

The district includes the city of Fredericton, and the towns of Oromocto, and Minto and vicinity.

The neighbouring ridings are Miramichi, Beauséjour, Fundy Royal, New Brunswick Southwest, and Tobique—Mactaquac.

==History==
&quot;York—Sunbury&quot; riding was created in 1914 from parts of Sunbury—Queen&#x27;s and York ridings. Previously, York County was its own riding and Sunbury County was joined with Queens County.

The riding was named after York and Sunbury counties of which it was composed.

In 1987, York—Sunbury was abolished. Some rural areas in the southern parts of the riding were transferred to Carleton—Charlotte riding, and a largely uninhabited area, moved to Miramichi. The remainder was incorporated into &quot;Fredericton&quot; riding. It was renamed &quot;Fredericton—York—Sunbury&quot; shortly after the 1988 election.

Fredericton-York-Sudbury was abolished in 1996 when more rural areas were moved into other districts (particularly Tobique—Mactaquac and New Brunswick Southwest, and a new riding named &quot;Fredericton&quot; was created. The Minto and Chipman areas were added to the riding in 2003. As per the 2012 federal electoral redistribution, this riding will lost territory to Miramichi—Grand Lake, New Brunswick Southwest and Tobique—Mactaquac, and gained some land from New Brunswick Southwest.

In the 2008 election, the Conservatives gained this seat from the Liberals. The Conservatives were strongest in the rural parts of this riding, outside of Fredericton proper. Within the city, the Liberals still held their own with the NDP capturing a handful of polls, including the University of New Brunswick, and a couple along Parkside Drive.

In the 2019 election, the riding got its first-ever &quot;third party&quot; MP from the Greens. Jenica Atwin won the seat from the former incumbent Liberal MP, Matt DeCourcey, who came third behind the Conservative candidate.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will be re-named Fredericton—Oromocto. Its border with Tobique—Mactaquac will be rerouted to follow the northern border of the City of Fredericton (2023 borders), and it will lose the remainder of the Parishes of Maugerville, Sheffield and Canning to Miramichi—Grand Lake; and will lose Burton Parish to Saint John—St. Croix, except for those parts of the parish that will be transferred to the Town of Oromocto in 2023.

==Members of Parliament==

This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

==Student vote results==

===2011===
In 2011, a student vote was conducted at participating Canadian schools to parallel the 2011 Canadian federal election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.

==Geography==
The riding extends along the north bank of the Saint Lawrence River between the north suburbs of Montreal and Trois-Rivières, straddling the Quebec regions of Lanaudière and Mauricie.

The district includes the Regional County Municipalities of D&#x27;Autray and Maskinongé, and the former cities of Pointe-du-Lac and Trois-Rivières-Ouest in the City of Trois-Rivières.

The neighbouring ridings are Joliette, Repentigny, Verchères—Les Patriotes, Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, Trois-Rivières, and Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

This riding lost territory to Trois-Rivières and gained territory from Joliette during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

==History==
The riding was created in 1924 from Berthier and Maskinongé. It consisted of Berthier County and Maskinongé County.

In 1947, it was redefined to consist of the county of Berthier and the town of Berthierville, the county of Maskinongé and the town of Louiseville, and Gouin township in the county of Joliette.

In 1952, it was abolished when it was merged into Berthier—Maskinongé—delanaudière riding.

The riding was recreated in 1966 as &quot;Berthier&quot; from the districts of Berthier—Maskinongé—Delanaudière, Chapleau, Joliette—L&#x27;Assomption—Montcalm, St-Maurice—Laflèche, and Three Rivers.

In 1975, the name of the riding was changed to &quot;Berthier-Maskinongé&quot;. After the 1980 election, the name of the district was changed to Berthier—Maskinongé—Lanaudière.

In the 1984 election, the seat was won by Progressive Conservative Robert de Cotret, who held it until the 1988 election. The riding was abolished in 1987. It was divided between Berthier—Montcalm, Champlain, and Saint-Maurice.

Berthier—Maskinongé was re-created in 2003. 44.8% of the riding came from Trois-Rivières, 36.0% from Berthier—Montcalm, and 19.2% from Saint-Maurice.

In the 2004 election and the 2006 election, Bloc Québécois MP Guy André was elected in the riding.

==Plot summary==
Van Ray and Deaqon Hayes are two mismatched cops teamed together by shady police lieutenant, Wilhelmina &quot;Billie&quot; Chambers, in a secretive undercover division of the Los Angeles Police Department. Operating with the motto &quot;Everything we seize, we keep. Everything we keep, we use,&quot; their base of operations is the &quot;Candy Store&quot; — a warehouse containing a fortune in confiscated cars, clothes, weapons and everything else needed to blend into the seedy criminal underworld of Los Angeles. Given criminal covers, the officers use all of the resources at their disposal to apprehend dangerous criminals while walking the line between cop and criminal.

<doc id="642573" wikidata="Q6939173" url="?curid=642573" title="Murray Cook">
<text>Murray James Cook, AM (born 30 June 1960) is an Australian musician, actor, and DJ. Cook was one of the founding members of the children&#x27;s band the Wiggles from 1991 to 2012. Cook provided guitar, vocals, and songwriting in the group, and remained involved with its creative and production aspects after his retirement. In 2013, Cook served as the Wiggles&#x27; tour manager. He also remains active in many music projects, including, writing and performing with the Sydney soul-rock band The Soul Movers. He is the father of wheelchair basketball player Georgia Munro-Cook. In 2015, he was one of the members of the Australian jury for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest.

==The Wiggles==

Cook returned to university and studied early childhood education at Macquarie University, where he met Anthony Field and Greg Page and formed the Wiggles in 1991. Cook worked as a preschool teacher for two years before the success of the Wiggles forced him to quit. According to Field, Cook would have been content to &quot;continue teaching and perhaps move into an academic role in the field. He knows his stuff and is simply great with children&quot;. As a member of the Wiggles, Cook wore a red skivvy and served as an instrumentalist and vocalist. He came up with the Wiggles&#x27; signature index finger-wagging move after watching professional ten pin bowlers do the move on television. He was considered the intellectual and analytical member of the group (something referred to in several episodes of their TV show), so he acted as mediator for their group decisions. When the Wiggles received honorary degrees from the Australian Catholic University in 2006, Cook gave the commencement speech to the graduates. On 17 May 2012, it was announced that Cook, along with Greg Page and Jeff Fatt, would be retiring from the Wiggles at the end of the year. He was replaced by Wiggles cast member Simon Pryce. Cook and the others expected to remain involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. In 2013, Cook served as the group&#x27;s tour manager. Cook told the &quot;Newcastle Herald&quot;, about his music career after his retirement from the Wiggles, &quot;I was kind of feeling my way for a few years, I guess&quot;.

==Other works==
In addition to continuing to play with Bang Shang A Lang, he performed lead guitar for the Proposition, a Sydney-based guitar pop band fronted by singer-songwriter Luke Russell on their 2015 album, &quot;Edge of the Dancefloor&quot;. Also in 2015, Cook was involved in the production of the play &quot;Sons of Sun&quot;, which was about American music producer Sam Phillips. In October 2017, Cook played guitar for the tribute show &quot;The Nancy Sinatra/Lee Hazlewood Experience&quot; with Zoe Carides and Scott Holmes in Newcastle, New South Wales.

While exploring other projects, Cook met Lizzie Mack, a member of the Sydney soul-rock band the Soul Movers, who along with Radio Birdman guitarist Deniz Tek and founder of The Soul Movers, were relaunching the group. In 2015, Cook began writing songs with Mack and decided to focus on the band and use it as his &quot;main creative outlet&quot; In 2017, the group recorded &quot;Testify&quot;, &quot;an album of energetic blues, soul and rock&quot;. The album was recorded at the Wiggles&#x27; studio in northwest Sydney and Jeff Fatt performed keyboards for the group. In 2019, the group recorded &quot;Bona Fide&quot;, which the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; called &quot;a stunning album&quot;. The album, which as Cook stated, included &quot;more roots-oriented songs to try to reflect a wide range of American music styles&quot;, and was recorded in the U.S.&#x27; &quot;premier soul studios&quot; such as Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, and FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He appeared with the group at the rock festival Splendour in the Grass in July 2018.

==Personal life==
In 1986, Cook joined the Sydney-based band Bang Shang a Lang. Cook&#x27;s major musical influences were the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, and Eric Clapton. He is married to Meg Munro and has two children, a son and a daughter, wheelchair basketball player Georgia Munro-Cook. On 30 November 2020, 11 months after fellow former bandmate Greg Page collapsed on stage and went into cardiac arrest, Cook opened up about a major health scare which forced him to undergo open heart surgery.

==Awards==
Cook, along with the other three original members of the Wiggles, was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2010 &quot;for service to the arts, particularly children&#x27;s entertainment, and to the community as benefactors and supporters of a range of charities&quot;.

<text>Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot (formerly known as Saint-Hyacinthe and St. Hyacinthe—Bagot) is a federal electoral district that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1935. It is located in Quebec, Canada. Its population in 2006 was 95,983. In the 2015 election, the winner received the lowest vote percentage of any winning candidate in the country.

==Geography==
The district includes the Regional County Municipalities of Acton and Les Maskoutains. It includes the communities of Saint-Hyacinthe, Acton Vale, Saint-Pie, Sainte-Madeleine, and Saint-Dominique.

==Political geography==
Almost all of the riding voted for the Bloc in 2006 except for parts of Roxton Falls and its surrounding township, Roxton which voted Conservative.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1933 from Bagot and St. Hyacinthe—Rouville ridings as &quot;St. Hyacinthe—Bagot&quot;. In 1947, the name was changed to &quot;Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot&quot;.

In 1966, the riding was abolished. Parts of the riding were combined with parts of Chambly—Rouville and Richelieu—Verchères riding into a new riding named &quot;Saint-Hyacinthe&quot;. Saint-Hyacinthe was renamed &quot;Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot&quot; after the 1980 election.

After the resignation of Yvan Loubier on 21 February 2007, a by-election occurred on 17 September 2007.

This riding was not changed as a result of the 2012 electoral redistribution.

Following the 2022 federal electoral redistribution the riding will be renamed Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot—Acton.

<doc id="642577" wikidata="Q5606096" url="?curid=642577" title="Greg Page (musician)">
<text>Gregory John Page, (born 16 January 1972) is an Australian singer, musician and actor. He is best known as the original lead singer and a founding member of the children&#x27;s band the Wiggles from 1991 to 2006 and then again in 2012. 

Starting with his self-titled debut album, since 1998, Page has recorded several solo albums, his latest, &quot;Here Comes Christmas!&quot;, being released in 2015. Since the mid 2000s, Page has suffered from severe health problems, which caused his early departure from the Wiggles and brief retirement in 2006; his 2012 album &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, began production in 2004, but was postponed due to his health conditions. 

Since coming out of retirement in 2009, Page has been performing live on stage again, including a handful of guest appearances with the original members of the Wiggles. After suffering cardiac arrest in 2020, Page has become an advocate for heart health and has founded the charity Heart of the Nation.

==Early life and education==
Page was born in Sydney, Australia. He grew up in Northmead, New South Wales, where he attended Baulkham Hills Primary School. Growing up, he had a low self-esteem. By the time he was 16, his hair started greying. He performed in several bands in secondary school.

==Early career==
Page was a member of the band Dead Giveaway. He was a roadie for and sang with the Australian band the Cockroaches during the band&#x27;s final years in the early 1990s. He befriended Cockroach member Anthony Field while on tour.

==The Wiggles==
===1990–2006===
After working as a roadie for the Cockroaches, on bandmate Anthony Field&#x27;s recommendation, he enrolled in Macquarie University to study early childhood education. While students, Page, Field, and guitarist Murray Cook, along with former Cockroaches member and keyboardist Jeff Fatt, combined their music backgrounds and teaching skills to form the Wiggles.

Field described Page as &quot;the perfect straight man&quot;, with a &quot;big friendly smile and easy stage manner&quot; which made him engrossing for both children and adults. Also according to Field, Page &quot;has an authoritative, though not overbearing, tone when he speaks to children and is a relaxed and clever emcee&quot;. When performing with the Wiggles, Page wore a yellow shirt. Like the other Wiggles, Page had a shtick, which was doing magic tricks.

On 30 November 2006, the Wiggles announced that Page would leave the group due to poor health. Although Page was missing for virtually all of the late 2006 U.S. tour, audiences were informed of Page&#x27;s absence at concerts moments before the curtain went up. 

Shortly after leaving the Wiggles, Page joined the cast of the children&#x27;s educational television program &quot;Butterscotch&#x27;s Playground&quot;. Page helped develop the show with its creators.

===2012–2020===
In January 2012, and amidst a great deal of controversy, the Wiggles announced that Page had regained his health and was returning to his role as the Yellow Wiggle, replacing Sam Moran, who had succeeded him. It was reported that he would return to touring with the group in March of that year. On 17 May 2012, it was announced that Page, along with Murray Cook and Jeff Fatt, would again be retiring from the Wiggles at the end of the year. He was to be replaced by Wiggles cast member Emma Watkins, the first female member of the Wiggles. Page eventually revealed that he was only asked to return to the group until August 2012, &quot;to help transition from Sam Moran to a new Yellow Wiggle,&quot; but once Cook and Fatt decided to retire at the end of the year, they asked Page if he would extend his stay with the group until then so he would leave alongside them, to which he agreed. Page and the others expected to remain involved with the creative and production aspects of the group, though Page no longer would have a share in the company, having sold it in 2006 when he left.

From time to time, beginning in 2016, Page has performed with the Wiggles for reunion shows and charity fundraisers. 

In July 2020, six months after suffering cardiac arrest, he and the original Wiggles appeared in The Soul Movers music video &quot;Circles Baby&quot;.

==Solo==
Page released his self-titled debut solo album in 1998. His second album, &quot;I Believe in Music&quot;, was released four years later, in 2002.

His 2005 solo album, &quot;Taking Care of Country&quot;, reflects Page&#x27;s interest in Elvis Presley&#x27;s music. It was recorded with the TCB Band, Elvis&#x27; back-up band. In spring 2003, Page performed in Las Vegas with the TCB Band. In 2002, Page sang backup with Australian Elvis impersonator Mick Gerace. His second album with the TCB Band, &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, was released in 2012. Production of the album began in 2004, but it was interrupted due to Page&#x27;s medical issues.

By late 2009, Page had recovered enough from his illness to begin touring with another country rock band, but with a more limited schedule than the Wiggles. He had also started his own foundation, the Greg Page Fund, to raise funds and educate the public about orthostatic intolerance.

In the following years, he has released more solo albums, including: &quot;Greg Page Live in Concert&quot; (2003), &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; (2004) and &quot;Here Comes Christmas!&quot; (2015). Page joined the cast of the children&#x27;s educational television program &quot;Butterscotch&#x27;s Playground&quot;. Page helped develop the show with its creators.

==Acting==
In January 2025, Page announced that he will be playing Franklin D. Roosevelt in Annie the musical.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Page has been married twice. His first marriage ended during his retirement from the Wiggles; in 2009, he had remarried. He has four children.

===Elvis memorabilia===
Page amassed the fourth-largest collection of Elvis Presley memorabilia in the world, including clothing, marriage certificate, guitar, piano, Elvis&#x27;s final Cadillac, and original TCB Band necklaces. In 2008, Page permanently loaned the collection, reportedly worth $1.5 million, to a new Elvis museum named &quot;The King&#x27;s Castle&quot; in Parkes, New South Wales.

===Health and retirement===
Page had experienced health difficulties since December 2005, when he underwent a double hernia operation and withdrew from his group&#x27;s U.S. tour in August 2006 after suffering repeated fainting spells, slurred speech, fatigue, and trembling. Although Page was missing for virtually all of the Wiggles&#x27; late 2006 U.S. tour, audiences were informed of Page&#x27;s absence at concerts moments before the curtain went up.

At first, Page was told that he had seven years to live, but he was diagnosed with a non-life-threatening form of dysautonomia, a difficult-to-diagnose chronic illness. Page experienced symptoms such as orthostatic intolerance, fatigue and loss of balance. Specialists believed that Page had mild episodes of the illness going back twelve years, and that his symptoms worsened after his hernias. It was decided that Page would retire from performing with the Wiggles to better manage his health. As part owner of the Wiggles, Page received a payout of about $20 million for his share in the business. 

Page was succeeded by Sam Moran as a full member of the entertainment side of the group (although still an employee, rather than a partner, in its business side).

While in retirement, Page was a presenter on &quot;Sydney Weekender&quot;.

On 17 January 2020, Page suffered cardiac arrest at a Wiggles reunion show that was raising funds for bushfire relief efforts. He collapsed on stage and stopped breathing; off-duty nurse Grace Jones, who was in the audience, performed CPR with Wiggles drummer Steve Pace and band staff member Kimmy Antonelli; they used a defibrillator three times before Page was transported to the hospital. The cardiac arrest was caused by a blocked artery, which was treated, and Page has since made a full recovery. He later posted a video explaining the situation and expressing his gratitude to those who saved him, including Jones, Pace, Antonelli, and Dr. Therese Wales, as well as other members of the Wiggles&#x27; crew. 

In July 2020, six months after suffering a heart attack, he and the original Wiggles appeared in the Soul Movers music video &quot;Circles Baby&quot;.

Page has since become an advocate for heart health and more widespread knowledge of CPR, founding a nonprofit initiative called &quot;Heart of the Nation&quot;, which has the goal of increasing public awareness of defibrillator locations across Australia, as well as encouraging businesses to keep a defibrillator on-site. He has also participated in several cardiac studies.

==Awards==
Page was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2010: &quot;For service to the arts, particularly children&#x27;s entertainment, and to the community as a benefactor and supporter of a range of charities&quot;.

<text>Cival is an archaeological site in the Petén Basin region of the southern Maya lowlands, which was formerly a major city of the Pre-Columbian Maya civilization. It is located in the present-day Department of Petén, Guatemala.

The site flourished from about the 6th century B.C. through the 1st century C.E., during the Preclassic Period (see: Mesoamerican chronology). It may have had a peak population of some 10,000 people.

The site is about 25 miles (40 km) east of Tikal, on a ridge over the left bank of the Holmul river.

The site has temples on step pyramids and plazas arranged to point to astronomical events such as the equinox sunrise, and is surrounded by a defensive wall. The site&#x27;s largest step pyramid is 27 metres high and 70 x 40 metres wide. Some buildings were decorated with stucco sculptures depicting Mesoamerican deities.

The site was long lost in the jungle, and was discovered and partly plundered by looters around 1980. It was first mapped by explorer Ian Graham in 1984, who gave it the name &quot;Cival&quot; after a local word for &quot;lagoon&quot;. The ancient name of the site is currently unknown.

Archaeological excavations of the site began in 2001 and are ongoing , led by Dr. Francisco Estrada-Belli. The project there originally began as part of investigations at the nearby Classic Maya site of Holmul, but attention was shifted to Cival as Cival&#x27;s age and importance became apparent. The excavations are sponsored by Vanderbilt University and the National Geographic Society, the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, the Ahau Foundation, ARB, Interco Tire, PIAA and Warn Industries.

Investigations at Cival have added to knowledge of the Pre-Classic Maya, including revealing the earliest inscriptions with Maya calendar dates and showing dynastic succession of monarchs.

Some news reports have incorrectly stated that Pre-Classic Maya cities were previously unknown. Pre-Classic buildings in the Peten have been excavated by archaeologists since the work at Uaxactun in the 1920s, and the major breakthrough which revealed that the Pre-Classic Maya were more highly developed and urbanized in this era than had long been thought was the archaeological project at El Mirador starting in the late 1970s.

<text>Axis of Justice is a non-profit organization co-founded by Serj Tankian and Tom Morello in 2002. It was founded &quot;to bring together musicians, fans of music, and grassroots political organizations to fight for social justice together.&quot; They &quot;aim to build a bridge between fans of music around the world and local political organizations to effectively organize around issues of peace, human rights, and economic justice.&quot; The group has worked for such causes as immigrant rights and death penalty abolition. Its recommended book list includes such authors as Karl Marx, Che Guevara, George Orwell, Noam Chomsky, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Grant Morrison.

==History==

In a 2003 interview, Tom Morello remarked that he formed Axis of Justice with Serj Tankian after witnessing some members of the audience at Ozzfest 2002 promoting racist symbols and imagery: &quot;I was sitting there stuck in traffic on my way to the show, and I was really shocked at the number of people who were sporting SS and Klan tattoos. I was like, &#x27;That’s just crazy, this is &quot;my&quot; music, too&#x27;.&quot;

In an effort to promote an adamant anti-racist and anti-fascist message, Axis of Justice allied with Anti-Racist Action shortly after its formation.

Axis of Justice tents appeared at music festivals where either Audioslave or System of a Down were playing, as it did at Lollapalooza 2003. The Axis of Justice also puts out a monthly radio show that can be heard on Pacifica Radio station KPFK (90.7 FM) in Los Angeles, California, and on XM Satellite Radio. The shows are archived in MP3 format on the AOJ website and are available as free downloads. They also have a number of books on their website that they recommend to support their views.

In 2004, they released a live album/DVD entitled &quot;Axis of Justice: Concert Series Volume 1&quot;. It contains performances by Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Brad Wilk from Rage Against the Machine, Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave, Serj Tankian from System of a Down, Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, Pete Yorn, Tim Walker, Maynard James Keenan of Tool, A Perfect Circle and Puscifer, and Wayne Kramer among others. It was recorded during a concert at the Avalon in Los Angeles. The concert was a benefit to raise money for the Axis of Justice and a variety of causes.

On April 6, 2006, Morello was honored with the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award for his support of worker&#x27;s rights and for his AOJ work. Morello has worked on numerous labor campaigns: the Guess sweatshop boycott, the LA janitors strike, the Taco Bell boycott, the southern California grocery workers strike &amp; lockout, and the Democratic Socialists of America&#x27;s Starbucks unionization campaign, among others.

Morello was a strong supporter of the 2006 United States immigration reform protests around the US. Morello played as the Nightwatchman at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles and has featured many articles on AOJ. On September 28, 2006, Morello was one of 400 protesters arrested protesting in support of immigrant hotel workers&#x27; rights, in what organizers called &quot;the largest act of civil disobedience in the history of Los Angeles&quot;.

<text>The melon is a mass of adipose tissue found in the foreheads of all toothed whales. It focuses and modulates the animal&#x27;s vocalizations and acts as a sound lens. It is thus a key organ involved in communication and echolocation.

==Description==
The melon is structurally part of the nasal apparatus and comprises most of the mass tissue between the blowhole and the tip of the snout. The function of the melon is not completely understood, but scientists believe it is a bioacoustic component, providing a means of focusing sounds used in echolocation and creating a similarity between characteristics of its tissue and the surrounding water so that acoustic energy can flow out of the head and into the environment with the least loss of energy. It was once hypothesized that the melon had functions in deep diving and buoyancy, but these ideas are no longer considered valid by cetologists.

The varying composition of the melon creates a sound velocity gradient that refracts sound directionally. Sounds also bounce off the skull and air sacs that surround the melon.

Melon size is unrelated to maximum dive depth in toothed whales. The particular characteristics of the melon probably have more to do with odontocete phylogeny, the taxonomic relationships over evolutionary time. In some species, melons are more specialized than in others. The sperm whale has the largest nose of any animal in the world. The bulk of that nose is composed of two large, fatty structures, the spermaceti organ and the &quot;junk&quot;. The junk is structurally the same as the melon (homologous to it). 

The melon is homologous to the spermaceti organ. Research on the expression of genes such as that for the protein MYH16 show it originates from the masseter muscle.

==Composition==
The melon is a mixture of triglycerides and wax esters. The exact composition varies throughout the melon. Typically, the inner core of the melon has a higher wax content than the outer parts and conducts sound more slowly. This gradient refracts sound and focuses it like a lens.

The lipids in the melon cannot be digested by the animal, as they are metabolically toxic. A starving dolphin has a robust melon even if the rest of its body is emaciated. The lipids in the melon tend to be of lower molecular weight and more saturated than the blubber.

The melons of the Delphinidae (dolphins) and Physeteroidea (sperm whales) have a significant amount of wax ester, whereas those of the Phocoenidae (porpoises) and Monodontidae (narwhals and beluga whales) contain little or no wax. The speed of sound in the melon is lowest in the Delphinidae, Phocoenidae, and Monodontidae, intermediate in the Ziphiidae (beaked whales), and highest in the Physeteridae and Platanistidae (South Asian river dolphins).

===Pilot whales===
The melon of pilot whales (Globicephala) is a mixture of wax esters and triglycerides. The inner core of the melon is about 33% wax esters, while the outer layer is about 5% wax esters. Most of the fats are saturated.

===Pygmy sperm whale===
In the pygmy sperm whale (&quot;Kogia breviceps&quot;), the melon consists of an outer layer and an inner core, which has a generally larger proportion of wax esters than the outer layer.

Behind the melon is a cornucopia-shaped organ that many scientists refer to as the &quot;spermaceti organ&quot;. This organ is different in form and composition from the spermaceti organ of the sperm whale.

===Sperm whale===
The analogous structure in the sperm whale is traditionally called &quot;the junk&quot; because whalers dismissed it as worthless for extracting sperm oil. It contains compartments of spermaceti separated by walls of cartilage.

===Beluga whale===
The melon of the beluga whale is also unique in that the whale can change the melon&#x27;s shape at will. These changes in shape probably have the effect of changing the size, shape, direction, and frequency composition of the echolocation beam.

<doc id="642584" wikidata="Q6173805" url="?curid=642584" title="Jeff Fatt">
<text>Jeffrey Wayne Fatt (born 21 July 1953) is a Chinese Australian musician and actor. He was a member of the children&#x27;s group The Wiggles from its founding in 1991 to 2012, and was also in the 1980s and 1990s pop band The Cockroaches with fellow Wiggle Anthony Field.

He was the oldest member of the original Wiggles line up. Fatt was also known for falling asleep on stage, causing the other members (and later on the audience) to utter the iconic Wiggles catchphrase &quot;Wake Up, Jeff!&quot;, which was also the title of one of their songs, as well as the title of one of their videos and albums.

==Early life and education==
The second youngest of four, Fatt&#x27;s Chinese parents Norma Wong Yee and Oscar Fatt owned a large retail store in Casino, New South Wales. His great-grandfather immigrated to Sydney, Australia in 1896, becoming a prosperous banana businessman. Fatt had aspirations to become an architect, and earned a Bachelor of Arts in industrial design. Anthony Field described him as a &quot;bush kid&quot; who &quot;first learned to let his keyboard do most of the talking&quot;.

==The Cockroaches==

He opened a public address equipment business with his brother in Sydney when he began playing keyboard for the rockabilly band the Roadmasters, and was recruited by Anthony and Paul Field to join the Cockroaches. Fatt joined the Cockroaches in 1981, serving as their keyboardist. In 1986 they signed with an independent label, Regular Records, which issued their first three albums, including &quot;The Cockroaches&quot; (March 1987), which peaked at No. 9 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart; it sold 70,000 copies and was certified platinum by their label. The album spawned the single &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s biggest hit when it peaked at No. 7 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart in April 1987.

==The Wiggles==

After The Cockroaches disbanded in the early 1990s, Anthony Field asked Fatt, who was renovating his house at the time, to help them record The Wiggles&#x27; first album in 1991. Fatt reported, &quot;I got this call from Anthony: &#x27;Hello, Anthony. Go away, go away. I&#x27;m not interested&#x27;, you know. He&#x27;s always got these ideas for things. He said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got this idea, come down to the studio&#x27;&quot;. Fatt&#x27;s response to Field&#x27;s request was, &quot;Sure but how long will it take?&quot; Field reported that as Fatt had done for the Cockroaches, he was &quot;a musical backbone for the Wiggles&quot;. As a Wiggle, Fatt wore a purple skivvy. 

He originated the Wiggles character Henry the Octopus and has occasionally voiced Wags the Dog, and performed those voices when other actors took over the roles. Fatt reported that it took twelve months to &quot;learn the language of preschool&quot;, including addressing children using the inclusive &quot;everybody&quot;, instead of &quot;boys and girls&quot;, and that the Wiggles&#x27; first performances were traumatic for him because he was not used to being around children.

===&quot;Wake Up, Jeff!&quot;===
Fatt&#x27;s schtick was sleeping at odd times, which led to a Wiggles catchphrase and the title of one of their songs, &quot;Wake Up, Jeff!&quot; Fatt was the oldest Wiggle and was well known for his &quot;laid-back personality&quot;, which according to Field, made him &quot;invaluable company on the road&quot;. As Sam Moran has said, when referring to the development of the Wiggles&#x27; shticks, &quot;Jeff really does fall asleep&quot;, and Fatt reported, &quot;The irony is I&#x27;m a very light sleeper in the nighttime. I will invariably have a snooze before the show&quot;. Fatt was the only member of the Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he stated that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his schtick, &quot;because it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything&quot;. Field claimed Fatt&#x27;s schtick endeared Fatt to their audiences and called it &quot;a simple audience participation and interaction gag we&#x27;ve done since the start of the group&quot;.

Kathleen Warren, the group&#x27;s former professor at Macquarie University and their consultant for their shows and DVDs, believed that the shtick empowered children, and Paul Field reported that children in the Wiggles&#x27; audience felt &quot;great excitement&quot; and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way.

Anthony Field reported that although in the early days of the group, they took turns falling asleep, it became Fatt&#x27;s schtick because &quot;it was a perfect fit&quot;.

===Retirement===
On 17 May 2012, it was announced that Fatt along with Greg Page and Murray Cook, would be retiring at the end of the year. Wiggles cast member Lachlan Gillespie replaced him as the purple Wiggle. Fatt and the others are expected to remain involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. He continues to perform in reunion shows.

In July 2020, he appeared with the other classic Wiggles in The Soul Movers music video &quot;Circles Baby&quot;. In September 2020, following the announcement of the birth of Gillespie&#x27;s daughters, Lulu and Lottie, it was announced Gillespie would take some time away from the group in order to spend time with them. As a result, Fatt decided to temporarily replace Gillespie to film The Wiggly World Of Dance Classes, a four-part series. Fatt has made appearances in the newest Wiggles series, season 3 of Ready, Steady, Wiggle and has returned as the voice of Henry the Octopus.

==Personal life==
Since 1990, Fatt has taken a photo a day documenting the most eventful thing that has happened to him. He was &quot;a keen surfer&quot;.

===Family===
Fatt was featured on the fourth episode of the twelfth season of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, where it was revealed that his maternal grandfather, David Yong Yee, immigrated to Sydney, Australia in 1896, becoming a prosperous banana businessman. In 1909, David and his family moved to Hong Kong where they were involved in the creation of the Chen Kwong company, a successful Chinese-Australian retail store and one of the first of its kind. The company was liquidated in 1925 due largely to the Canton-Hong Kong strike, where they returned to Sydney, Australia in 1938. His paternal great-great-grandmother, Elizabeth Wright, was born in Middlesex, England and arrived in Melbourne, Australia in 1853 as a domestic servant. Elizabeth married Fatt&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Lee Young, a hay and corn storekeeper in Ballarat with origins from Canton, soon thereafter. Lee and Wright later moved to Ararat in 1863, where Lee became a Chinese interpreter for the city&#x27;s colonial court until 1873. The couple later returned and retired in Ballarat, with Wright dying in 1892 and Young dying in 1899. Their second youngest child of six, and Fatt&#x27;s paternal great-grandmother, Emma, married Chinese Methodist missionary Joseph Tear Tack in 1885 and moved to Tingha until 1896, where they then moved to Darwin and was affected by the 1897 Darwin cyclone, being among the residents who lost their home. They later moved to Cairns in 1900. Joseph died a year later in August 1901 and was survived by Emma and their four children, who returned to Ballarat, then Burwood, before eventually settling in Concord West. Emma later died on 28 October 1948.

===Health===
In early July 2011, Fatt underwent heart surgery after feeling unwell for several weeks and having a blackout. He was diagnosed as having a heart arrhythmia and was fitted with a pacemaker at Sydney&#x27;s Mater Hospital. His surgery was &quot;urgent but routine&quot; and Fatt was expected to recover completely. He missed the summer US tour as a result, after never missing a show in 20 years.

==Awards==
In what Paul Field called &quot;one of the highlights of their 15 years of being together&quot;, Fatt, along with the original members of the Wiggles, was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Australian Catholic University in 2006. All five members of the band were awarded another honorary doctoral degree in 2009 from Macquarie University. Fatt, along with the other three original Wiggles, was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in January 2010 &quot;for service to the arts, particularly children&#x27;s entertainment, and to the community as a benefactor and supporter of a range of charities.&quot; Fatt also received an ARIA Hall of Fame Award with the Wiggles in 2011.

<text>Brampton West () is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 2004. Its population was 170,422 in 2006- making it the most populous riding in Canada.

The district includes the western part of the city of Brampton excluding the neighbourhood of Madoc.

The electoral district was created in 2003: 72.8% of the population of the riding came from Brampton West—Mississauga, and 27.2% from Brampton Centre. As a result of the 2012 electoral redistribution, this riding lost just over half of its territory, mostly to Brampton South, with portions going to Brampton North.

The Toronto Real Estate Board labels this section as &quot;W24&quot; in their studies.

People of Jamaican ethnic origin make up 13.0% of the riding&#x27;s population, the highest such percentage in Canada.

The 2008 federal election in this riding featured candidates from the four main national parties. The Greens&#x27; Patti Chemelyk is an administrator in the health care industry; Jagtar Shergill of the NDP was a registered insurance broker who had run for the party in 2006 and for Brampton City Council the same year; Conservative Kyle Seeback is a commercial litigation lawyer and former national-level swimmer; and winner Andrew Kania, a Liberal, practiced family law.

Seeback was nominated by the Conservatives in April 2008.

Liberal incumbent Colleen Beaumier announced her retirement from the politics. This left the riding without an incumbent, and the Brampton West Federal Liberal Riding Association without a candidate to run. The hopefuls for the Liberal nomination were Dipika Damerla, Raj Jhajj, and Andrew Kania. Jhajj was the riding president, but stepped down from the position, to be considered. Kania had previously sought the party&#x27;s nomination in Brampton—Springdale, but then-Prime Minister Paul Martin placed Dr. Ruby Dhalla as the candidate. On September 12, the riding association gathered at the Marriott Courtyard Convention Centre, where Kania&#x27;s selection was announced.

Kania won by a small margin, with the election being one of the last to be called, with Kania not taking the lead until midnight; the election was so tight, &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; declared Seeback the winner in a published article, latter retracted. The Conservatives won nationally, with the Liberals losing around 20 seats. Kania commented, &quot;I am very thankful to the people of Brampton West for trusting me to represent them in circumstances where the Liberal Party lost about 20 seats. Nobody will work harder, or care more. They will not be disappointed and much good will come from this win.&quot; Seeback commented that, &quot;I said it was going to be under a thousand votes; I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this close, though.&quot;

On October 23, 2008, Elections Canada announced that a judicial recount had been granted in Brampton West, under an Ontario Superior Court judge. It is the fifth recount ordered, post-election.

<doc id="642590" wikidata="Q826076" url="?curid=642590" title="Sejny">
<text>Sejny (; ) is a town in north-eastern Poland and the capital of Sejny County, in Podlaskie Voivodeship, close to the northern border with Lithuania and Belarus. It is located in the eastern part of the Suwałki Lake Area (), on the Marycha river (&quot;Seina&quot; in Lithuanian for which the town was named), being a tributary of the Czarna Hańcza. As of 1999 it had almost 6,500 permanent inhabitants, with a strong seasonal increase during the tourist season.

== Etymology ==
According to a legend, the town of Sejny was started by three of the old knights of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Władysław II Jagiełło, who after the Battle of Grunwald granted them a land parcel in what is now Sejny. The three were very old and named the settlement &quot;Seni&quot;, which is a Lithuanian word for &quot;Old Men&quot;. The name was purportedly given to the city of Sejny. However, no archaeological findings or documents support this legend.

The name is Yotvingian in origin. The linguist Jerzy Nalepa has proposed that the nearby river named Sejna (now Marycha) and the city name are Yotvingian. This conclusion is based on two features:

# the presence of West Baltic &quot;&quot;s&quot; (vs. modern Lith. &quot;š&quot;) 
# retention of the diphthong &quot;ei&quot;.

Cognates include Pol. &quot;siano&quot; and Lith. &quot;šienas&quot;, both meaning &quot;hay&quot;&quot;.

== History ==
===Middle Ages===
In the early Middle Ages the area comprising modern Sejny was inhabited by the Yotvingians, one of the Baltic tribes closely related to Lithuanians that had arrived in the area in the first millennium. There was ongoing strife for the area since the 13th century between the Teutonic Order and Lithuania. This resulted in the area being almost completely depopulated, with only a few of the indigenous Yotvingians surviving. The first written record of the area where the town now lies dates to 1385, noting an armed raid of the German knights from Castrum Leicze (Giżycko) to Merkinė.

After the Treaty of Melno in 1422, Teutonic-Lithuanian border was determined, people began to return to the forests in the area. The territory formed part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania within the Polish–Lithuanian union under the Jagiellonian dynasty, since 1569 transformed into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. New roads were paved, with one of them, the road leading from Berżniki (&quot;Beržininkai&quot;) through Sejny to Merkinė, becoming a notable trade route.

=== Early modern era ===
==== 16th century ====
In 1510 Michał Pac became the governor of the area, founding the settlement of Beržininkai (). This started a period of the rapid development of the former Yotvingian lands. On December 22, 1522, Sigismund I the Old ordered the voivode of Podlaskie Janusz Kostewicz to grant of land at the shores of the river Sejna (now called Marycha) to hetman Iwan Wiśniowiecki. On May 21 of the following year, Kostewicz described the parcel in a letter to the king and soon afterwards Wiśniowiecki became the owner of the area. A new wooden manor was built in the place where the Sejna river reached Sejny lake and soon settlement started. Wiśniowiecki, a mighty magnate from Volhynia, never came there personally and instead appointed his governor to rule the hamlet.

In 1593 the town was sold by his great-granddaughter Anna, wife of voivode of Witebsk Mikołaj Sapieha, to a local noble Jerzy Grodziński for &quot;sixty times the amount of 10.000 grosz in silver&quot;. Until 1602 he transferred the unnamed village (sometimes referred to as &quot;Sejna&quot;) into a town called &quot;Juriewo&quot;, after its founder. However, the name did not stick and instead it was named Sejny.

The town&#x27;s market was located on a small hill overlooking the right bank of the river, near the original wooden manor. It was located right on the earlier trade route. South of the town, a new road leading to Grodno was created and the new settlement received significant income from trading. The founder of the town financed a Catholic St George&#x27;s church and established a new parochy.

====17th century====

Jerzy Grodziński died without heirs. On May 16, 1602, he had bequeathed all of his properties to the Dominican monastery in Vilnius. He died on 12 January 1603 and on 4 June 1603 king Sigismund III Vasa accepted the testament. In 1610 the monks started the construction of a large monastery there. The construction of the monastery was finished in 1619 and by 1632 a new church was built nearby, devoted to Holy Mary, Saint George and Saint Hyacinth. The town developed slowly, mostly due to low traffic on the old trade routes to Grodno. In the 17th century, another church was built, consecrated to the Holy Spirit. A printing press was started and most probably a hospital. The monastery was being constantly expanded, becoming one of the most notable examples of a fortified monastery in Central Europe.

War with Swedish Empire, known as The Deluge, was disastrous for the town. In 1656, after a major battle took place nearby, the town was captured by the Swedes, looted and burnt to the ground. The monastery survived and after the war ended, the monks returned to the town and started its reconstruction. On November 8, 1670, the king Michael I granted the town the privilege of organizing a market and fair once a week. This helped the monks to repopulate the town with new Polish settlers, mostly from over-populated Masovia.

==== 18th century ====
In the early 18th century the Great Northern War put an end to the prosperity, as the town was pillaged by several armies in a row. The soldiers also carried two consecutive plagues to the town.
At the same time, the area was being populated, and numerous settlements were founded not far from Sejny. In 1715 the Camedulian monks founded a village and a monastery, which developed into what is now the town of Suwałki. Other towns founded in that period were Puńsk, Augustów, Jeleniewo and Krasnopol. With increased prosperity in the town, the Dominicans started the reconstruction of Sejny, leading to the construction of notable examples of baroque architecture. The church received a new façade, in 1770 a new town hall was built, and in 1778 a new marketplace and a new Wooden synagogue were opened.

===19th century===
During the Third Partition of Poland, Sejny was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1795 and was made part of the newly established province of New East Prussia. Initially neglected, in 1807 the town became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw and a major administrative centre within the Łomża Department. After the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815, the town became part of newly formed Congress Poland in the Russian Partition of Poland, retaining its status as a seat of a powiat within the Augustów Voivodeship. In 1818 the bishopric was moved to Sejny from Wigry and Sejny Priest Seminary was established in 1826. The town continued to prosper, despite a major fire that had struck the city earlier that year. The population also grew rapidly. Prosperity declined in the latter part of the 19th century. 

==== Uprisings ====
During the November Uprising and the January Uprising the town&#x27;s inhabitants took part in the struggles against Imperial Russia. After the massacres of Polish protesters committed by the Russians in Warsaw in 1861, Polish processions and clashes with Russian soldiers took place in Sejny. The Sejny County was one of the counties in which the insurgent unit of operated during the January Uprising in 1863. Sejny was one of the sites of Russian executions of Polish insurgents during the January Uprising. There is a memorial at the place of the executions.

After the uprisings the town was deprived of its privileges and neglected by Russia. The lack of railway development by the Russian Empire prevented the town from developing industry. Sejny continued as a small provincial town and a local centre of trade and commerce. Nonetheless, the Neo-baroque Sejny Synagogue was built in the 1860s, now used as a cultural center after the deportation and murder of the Jews by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust during World War II.

=== World War I ===

During World War I, in 1915 the town was captured and then occupied by Germany. Initially their forces made it part of the Ober Ost military administration, but Germany planned this area to be one of the puppet states in Central Europe in accordance with their Mitteleuropa plan. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, the German garrisons started to withdraw from the area.

===Interbellum===
On May 8, 1919 Germany handed over the administration to Lithuania which recently declared its independence. This led to tensions between Lithuania and Poland (which also declared independence around the same time), as both claimed the area. Under pressure from the Conference of Ambassadors (later to become the League of Nations), Poland initially backed down on the issue, but, on August 22, 1919, on the day German troops withdrew from the area, Polish Military Organization organized a military action against the Lithuanian rule in what became known as the Sejny Uprising (or &quot;Seinai Revolt&quot;). Sejny changed hands several times. During these battles, both sides used repressive measures - the Lithuanians had deported a lot of Polish families, while the Polish had closed all Lithuanian schools. On August 28, the uprising ended with a Polish success, and the town became a part of Poland. After Poles acquired the town and its surroundings, the Lithuanian population of the region was subject to various repressions, which included evictions; banning the use of Lithuanian language in public; closures of Lithuanian organizations, schools and press; and confiscation of property. The Polish historian Piotr Łossowski has suggested that both sides exaggerated repressions they suffered during the uprising and its aftermath in order to elicit internal and external support. Sejny town at the time had approximately 2500 inhabitants.
Only a year later, the town was captured by the Soviet Russia in the course of the Polish–Soviet War. To ensure the right of passage through Lithuanian territory, on 12 July 1920 the Soviet authorities signed the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920, in which it ceded the area to Lithuania. On July 19 the Lithuanians recaptured the town. Then the Lithuanians closed Polish schools and offices, and began harassing Poles. After the Battle of Warsaw the Bolshevik forces were defeated and the Polish Army attacked the Lithuanian forces. As the Paris Peace Conference established the Polish-Lithuanian border roughly correspondent to the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, the Lithuanian forces were forced to withdraw from the town and on 31 August 1920 the town once again passed to Polish hands. However, the Lithuanian authorities still claimed the area and Lithuanian successfully counterattacked on September 2. However, the Polish Army recaptured the town on September 9. The following day the last of the Lithuanian units retreated to the other side of the border and on October 7 a cease fire agreement was signed, leaving Sejny on the Polish side of the border, so Sejny and the vicinity became part of reborn Polish state. In the interbellum, the town was still desired by Lithuania.

In 1925 the bishopric and the powiat status were removed, but the town remained a notable centre of not only trade and commerce but also wood and furniture production, gaining profits from the nearby forests. In 1925, Sejny became part of the Suwałki County (powiat) and it was only in 1956 that the Sejny County (powiat) was restored (during the Polish People&#x27;s Republic).

The 1930s saw the development of the town and the construction of new residential buildings and workplaces. Sejny was part of Poland &quot;B&quot;, that is, it was located in a poorer part of Poland.

=== World War II ===

During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, in 1939 the town was first captured by the Soviet Union on September 24, 1939. Sejny was severely pillaged and then on 13 October 1939 transferred to Nazi Germany. It remained occupied by the Germans until August 1944.

Poles were subjected to mass arrests, executions and deportations to Nazi concentration camps, and the local Jewish community was almost completely destroyed. The Germans carried out a massacre of 10 Poles at the local cemetery in 1939. The Germans closed down both Polish and Lithuanian schools and then looted and destroyed school libraries. Poles managed to organize secret teaching, but soon the Germans carried out mass arrests of Polish teachers, who were then imprisoned in a Gestapo jail in Suwałki. Nevertheless, secret Polish education continued until the end of the occupation. In April 1940 the Germans carried out mass arrests of 150 Poles, 10 of whom were publicly executed at the market square on April 24, 1940, and the wójt of Gmina Sejny was murdered in Prudziszki on April 26, 1940. Several Polish priests were arrested and deported to the Sachsenhausen, Soldau and Dachau concentration camps, where most of them died. Two priests survived the concentration camps and the war: one, who also held American citizenship, eventually settled in the United States, where he received medical treatment in the following years, and the other returned to Poland after surviving Nazi human experimentation in Dachau. Poles were expelled from church properties, which were then handed over to Germans as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. Works of art and vital records were robbed by the Germans from the local church and taken to Königsberg.

On 31 July 1944 the town was captured a first time by the Red Army, then a second time on 18 August 944. Soon afterwards, it was delivered to the new Soviet-controlled communist authorities of Poland.

=== Recent period and modern Sejny ===
After the war, the local population, largely depleted during the war, started to recuperate. A notable influx of Poles resettled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union allowed for fast reconstruction of the town. In 1956, after the administrative reform of that year, Sejny once again became a seat of a powiat. Although it was cancelled in 1975, the new administrative division of Poland passed in 1999 reinstituted it. Depopulation may ultimately again threaten the present local and regional administrative organisation. 

In 1980, Lithuanian priests, including priest , visited Sejny and were forbidden to celebrate Mass in Lithuanian in the Sejny Basilica. The priests wrote a letter of protest to the Pope John Paul II that the Polish Lithuanians could not pray in Lithuanian. From 16 October 1983, the services in the Sejny St. Basilica of the Virgin Mary began to be held in Lithuanian. 

Currently, Sejny is a notable centre of trade, production and tourism, with thousands of tourists visiting the town every year. A dairy and a cheese factory are located in the town, as well as numerous hotels.

Sejny is also a notable centre of the cultural life of the Lithuanian minority in Poland. It is the main seat of the Lithuanian Society of Poland and the &quot;Aušra&quot; bi-weekly.
Lithuanians constituted 7.9% (474) of the city&#x27;s inhabitants in 2002 and 20.2% (4,271) of the population in the Sejny County (powiat) in 2011. Due to that, there is a Lithuanian consulate there, as well as a Lithuanian schooling complex (kindergarten, elementary school, gymnasium).

Owing to a lost dispute about payment for the town&#x27;s sewage treatment works, the town is financially crippled by debt. Mayor Arkadiusz Nowalski is fighting to rescue the town, which lacks sufficient collateral for necessary investment or to seek European development funding. Although mayor, with his 2014 shock win against the incumbent, he does not have the majority support of the council.

<text>Kitchener Centre () is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1997.

==Geography==
The district includes the north-central and north-eastern parts of the city of Kitchener, Ontario, including the downtown core.

==Political geography==
In 2008, the race in Kitchener was razor thin between the Conservatives and Liberals. Politically, the riding is split by the Conestoga Parkway—the area to the west of the Parkway tends to support the Liberals while the area to the east of it tends to vote for the Conservatives. The New Democrats also won a small handful of polls, scattered around the riding.
In 2019, The Greens saw one of their largest increases as their share of the vote jumped up 23 points, from 3% to 26%, and took second place from the Conservatives. In terms of vote share and margin of loss, this was the Greens&#x27; most successful result in Ontario (even better than neighbouring Guelph, which has a Green MPP) and part of their surge in the south west of the province. In 2021, despite a nationwide vote collapse for the Greens, returning candidate Mike Morrice was able to pull off an upset win, largely helped by the collapse in support for the incumbent Liberal MP, Raj Saini, being involved in sexual assault allgations. This makes Morrice the first ever Green MP from Ontario on the federal level.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;
Ethnic groups: 71.5% White, 7.9% Black, 5.8% South Asian, 3.3% Indigenous, 2.5% Latin American, 2.1% Southeast Asian, 1.9% Arab, 1.3% Chinese, 1.0% West Asian

Religions: 53.4% Christian (22.2% Catholic, 4.3% Christian Orthodox, 3.6% Lutheran, 2.8% United Church, 2.5% Anglican, 1.4% Presbyterian, 1.4% Pentecostal, 1.4% Anabaptist, 1.2% Baptist, 12.6% other), 5.9% Muslim, 2.6% Hindu, 1.0% Sikh, 35.0% none
Median income: $40,800 (2020) 
Average income: $50,440 (2020)

==History==

The electoral district was created in 1996 from parts of Kitchener and Kitchener—Waterloo ridings.

It initially consisted of the part of the City of Kitchener bounded on the west by the western limit of the city, on the south by a line drawn from west to east along the Conestoga Parkway, Strasburg Road, Block Line Road, the Canadian Pacific Railway line, and Highway No. 8, on the east by the Grand River, and on the north by a line drawn from east to west along Victoria Street, Lawrence Avenue and Highland Road West.

In 2003, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of Kitchener bounded on the west by the western limit of the city, on the north by a line drawn from west to east along Highland Road West, Fischer Hallman Road and the Canadian National Railway situated northerly of Shadeland Crescent, on the east by the Grand River, and on the south by a line drawn from east to west along the King Street Bypass (Highway No. 8), King Street East and the Conestoga Parkway.

This riding lost territory to Kitchener—Conestoga and Kitchener South—Hespeler, and gained territory from Kitchener—Waterloo during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<text>Pope Anianus (Greek: Ανιανός, transliterated: Anianós) was the 2nd Patriarch of Alexandria. He was ordained by Saint Mark the Evangelist, and was also the first convert Mark won to Christianity in the region.

==Connection with Saint Mark==

As St. Mark was entering Rakotis, a suburb of Alexandria, after his trip from Cyrene to the Pentapolis, the strap of his sandal fell off. He found a cobbler, St. Anianus, to repair it. While he was working on the sandal, the awl slipped in Anianus&#x27; hand, piercing it. Anianus cried &#x27;&quot;Heis ho Theos&quot; (&quot;God is one&quot;) in response to the pain. Mark took the opportunity to say 
the Gospel of Christianity to him, at the same time reportedly miraculously healing Anianus of his wound.

How it was that Anianus was a monotheist in Alexandria is a matter of conjecture. Some have suggested that he was himself a Jew, or perhaps a pagan native who had come under the influence of the wealthy Jewish community, and learned his monotheistic beliefs there. Others have held that Anianus was a noble, although this does seem to be contrary to the documents available.

In any event, Mark was invited to Anianus&#x27;s house, where he taught Anianus&#x27; family the Gospel and baptized them all. A large number of natives of the area were quickly converted by Mark and his followers, causing those citizens who did not convert to feel obliged to defend their local gods against the new faith.

==Ordination of Anianus==
Mark, the outsider, decided it might be best if he were to leave the area for a while. He ordained Anianus to be bishop in his absence. He also ordained three presbyters and seven deacons at the same time, charging the group of them with watching over the church of the area in his absence.

Mark was gone for a period of two years, during which time he is said to have gone to Rome, Aquileia, and the Pentapolis, preaching, performing miracles, and winning converts to Christianity at each location. On Mark&#x27;s return, he found that the church in Alexandria had grown significantly, and that they were able to build a church for themselves at Bucolia on the shore of the eastern harbor of Alexandria, also known as the Portus Magnus of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

Following the martyrdom of Mark on the 30th day of Baramudah, Anianus became the patriarch of the church in Alexandria. He would remain in that capacity for over seventeen and one-half years. During that time, the number of Christians in the area grew significantly, and Anianus ordained new priests and deacons for the growing church. The extent of the evangelization they performed is unknown, although it has been thought by some that it was done at least somewhat covertly, given the hostility the pagan population demonstrated to the new faith. Anianus died in bed, and was buried next to Mark at the church in Baucalis.

==Dispute==
It is a matter of some dispute whether Anianus was the first or second Patriarch of Alexandria. The Catholic Church and some others hold that Anianus was the first patriarch. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria holds that Mark was the first patriarch of Alexandria, making Anianus second.

==Veneration==
He is regarded as a saint, with a feast day of 20 Hathor in the Coptic Orthodox Church and 25 April in the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church.

==Church Dedications==
The church of St. Anianus in Monroe Township, NJ is the first Coptic Orthodox Church in the world dedicated in the name of St. Anianus.

<text>The following is a list of episodes for the American-Canadian post-apocalyptic action-drama television series &quot;Jeremiah&quot;, starring Luke Perry and Malcolm-Jamal Warner that ran on the Showtime network from 2002 to 2004. The series takes place in a future wherein the adult population has been wiped out by a deadly virus.

The series ended production in 2003, after the management of Showtime decided they were not interested in producing science fiction programming anymore. Had the series continued, it would have run under a different showrunner than Straczynski, who decided to leave following the completion of the production of the second season due to creative differences between him and MGM Television.

Episodes for the final half of the second season did not begin airing in the United States until September 3, 2004.

<doc id="642597" wikidata="Q3055086" url="?curid=642597" title="Entertainment Tonight">
<text>Entertainment Tonight (or simply ET) is an American first-run syndicated news broadcasting newsmagazine program that is distributed by CBS Media Ventures throughout the United States and owned by Paramount Streaming. Having premiered on September 14, 1981, it holds the Guinness World Record as the longest-running entertainment news program on television.

International versions of the show are distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.

==Format==
The format of the program is composed of stories of interest from throughout the entertainment industry, exclusive set visits, first looks at upcoming film and television projects, and one-on-one interviews with actors, musicians and other entertainment personalities and newsmakers.
A one-hour weekend edition, &quot;ET Weekend&quot; (known as &quot;Entertainment This Week&quot; until September 1991), originally offered a recap of the week&#x27;s entertainment news, with most or all episodes later transitioning to center (either primarily or exclusively) around some sort of special theme; though the weekend edition now utilizes either format depending on the episode, most commonly, the format of those broadcasts consists of replays of stories that were shown during the previous week&#x27;s editions.

&quot;ET Radio Minute&quot;, a daily radio feature, is syndicated by Westwood One.

As of 2021, the program&#x27;s weekday broadcasts are anchored by Kevin Frazier and Nischelle Turner, while the weekend editions are anchored by Rachael Smith.

==History==
In its early years from its September 1981 inception, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;–following a local newscast-style format–consisted primarily of coverage of the latest movies, music and television releases and projects.

They signed an exclusive agreement to cover the wedding of convicted child molester Mary Kay Letourneau, who married the student she had an affair with, Vili Fualaau; and attorney Howard K. Stern, who represented Daniel Birkhead in the Dannielynn Birkhead paternity case of the late Anna Nicole Smith&#x27;s daughter Dannielynn. &quot;ET&quot; aired exclusive stories related to Smith, including coverage of her funeral, and her surviving daughter.

In 1996, actor George Clooney decided to boycott &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; to protest the presence of intrusive paparazzi after &quot;Hard Copy&quot; did an exposé about his love life, violating an agreement that he had with Paramount, which produced and syndicated both shows. In a letter he sent to Paramount, Clooney stated that he would encourage his friends to do the same.

On September 8, 2008, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; began broadcasting in high-definition television; concurrently, the program moved its production and studio operations from its longtime home at Stage 28 on the Paramount Pictures studio lot to Stage 4 at CBS Studio Center, one of the final steps involving the incorporation of Paramount&#x27;s former syndication arm, Paramount Domestic Television, into CBS&#x27; distribution arms and the adoption of the then-new CBS Television Distribution name, which all took place following the breakup of CBS and the original Viacom into separate companies in December 2005.

After pressure via a social media campaign by actors Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, &quot;ET&quot; announced in February 2014 that it would no longer accept footage or pictures of the children of celebrities from paparazzi photographers.

In January 2020, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; set the Guinness World Record for the longest-running entertainment news show on TV.

=== ET Live ===
In November 2018, CBS launched a free, 24-hour over-the-top streaming service known as &quot;ET Live&quot;; it features the correspondents from the linear show with expanded coverage of entertainment news. It is available via web browsers, apps, and most recently, the free streaming service Pluto TV (which added &quot;ET Live&quot; to its channel lineup in November 2019).

=== Mixible ===
In July 2022, it was announced that the service would be rebranded as Mixible, and continue to air a mixture of entertainment, lifestyle, and pop culture-related programming (including &quot;ET&#x27;s The Download&quot;), but with expanded contributions from other Paramount Global properties such as MTV, VH1, Awesomeness, ComicBook.com (formerly), &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, and &quot;The Drew Barrymore Show&quot;.

<text>Withdean 2000 Football Club were an English football team based in Withdean, in Brighton, who most recently played in the Combined Counties League. Originally called Westdene, they changed their name to Withdean in the late 1980s and added the &quot;2000&quot; after a reorganisation in that year, after which they moved from the Sussex County League to the CCL.

They won the CCL championship in 2002–03, winning 40 games, drawing four and losing only two, coming from behind to overwhelm AFC Wallingford, who had won the previous season, and AFC Wimbledon, who would win the following season. A relentless series of resounding victories in re-arranged postponed games toward the end of the season placed them beyond the reach of their rivals.

However, circumstances promptly conspired against them. Since they had given up their home ground to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion after the latter lost the Goldstone Ground, Withdean&#x27;s playing facilities were not fit to qualify them for promotion from the CCL to the Isthmian League and in the close season of 2003 their wealthy backer Alan Pook and many of the best players left for Isthmian League team Worthing. Consequently, in the 2003–04 season Withdean 2000 struggled near the bottom of the table. Unable to finance their outgoings any longer, in June 2004 they withdrew from the CCL for the following season and the club were disbanded.

<text>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) is the trade association of the video game industry in the United States. It was formed in April 1994 as the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) and renamed on July 21, 2003. It is based in Washington, D.C. Most of the top publishers in the gaming world (or their American subsidiaries) are members of the ESA.

The ESA also organized the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) trade expo in Los Angeles, California. The ESA&#x27;s policy is based by member companies serving on the ESA&#x27;s three Working Groups: &quot;Intellectual Property Working Group&quot;, &quot;Public Policy Committee&quot; and &quot;Public Relations Working Group&quot;.

==History==
The concept of the IDSA/ESA arose from the controversies that the violence depicted in the video game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; drew. This led to a United States Congress hearing in late 1993, where the video game industry was put under scrutiny for the level of violence in games like &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Night Trap&quot;. During these hearings, Sega and Nintendo blamed the other for the situation, citing differences in how they would rate the content of games for players. Following the hearings, Congressman Joe Lieberman proposed the Video Game Ratings Act of 1994, which would have set a government-overseen commission to establish a ratings system for video games, and threatened to push it through legislation if the video game industry did not voluntarily come up with one of its own. Recognizing the threat of government oversight, the companies decided to establish the IDSA to be a unified front and represent all video game companies at this level, and subsequently developed the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) to create a voluntary but standardized rating approach to video games. At first, Sega proposed to IDSA that they wanted to use the Videogame Rating Council ratings, but Nintendo turned down the proposal, fearing it was out of place. In July 1994, IDSA representatives returned to Congress to present the ESRB, which Congress accepted and became the standard for the American industry.

The IDSA formally renamed itself to the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) on July 21, 2003. The renaming was made to reflect that the associated companies were primarily in the realm of creating entertainment software across ranges of devices, and the new name was selected to more clearly define the industry. Doug Lowenstein founded the ESA. On December 14, 2006, game blog Kotaku reported that he was resigning to take a job in finance outside the industry. On May 17, 2007, Mike Gallagher replaced Doug Lowenstein as the president of the ESA.

In 2019, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Gallagher had lost the confidence of the board of directors over a number of related issues in the preceding years. His office was characterized as a toxic work environment in which he pitted his subordinates against each other and sent them belittling messages. He also fired an experienced high-level employee in favor of a new employee he preferred. With the 2016 election of Donald Trump, Gallagher attempted to publicly align the ESA with Trump&#x27;s policies, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was unpopular with members of the association. Robert A. Altman and Phil Spencer, then the chair and vice-chair of the board, respectively, spearheaded an internal investigation into Gallagher&#x27;s conduct. Gallagher announced on October 3, 2018, that he would be stepping down as president; then ESA senior vice-president Stanley Pierre-Louis served as interim president during ESA&#x27;s search for a permanent replacement. In the end, ESA opted to elect Pierre-Louis as the permanent president and CEO in May 2019.

==Activities==
In addition to overseeing the ESRB, the ESA organized the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). After the IDSA&#x27;s formation, the video game industry became concerned over the treatment they had received at recent Consumer Electronic Shows and were seeking another trade show venue. The IDSA partnered with International Data Group (IDG) to organize the first E3, held in May 1995 in Los Angeles. The first E3 proved more successful than originally expected, and the IDSA negotiated with the IDG to take ownership of E3 and its intellectual property, with the IDG serving to help handle execution of the event. In a 1997 interview, IDSA president Doug Lowenstein said E3 is also the primary source of income for the IDSA. In 2016, revenues from running E3 accounted for about 48% of the organization&#x27;s annual budget, with another 37% coming from membership dues. Some member companies criticized the ESA for its split focus between producing E3 and acting as a legislative advocacy group, with neither focus receiving adequate attention. Following the high profile withdrawals of companies like Sony and Electronic Arts from attending E3, the direction of E3 was called into question, with some members advocating for the business of running E3 to be split out into a separate company. The ESA ultimately discontinued E3 in December 2023.

The ESA leads in confronting legislation that would be harmful to the video game industry, particularly related to video game rating controversies under the ESRB, and encouraging legislation that would be beneficial to the industry. Of note, the ESA was one plaintiff in &quot;Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association&quot;, a Supreme Court case that judged that video games were protected works under the First Amendment in 2012, and helped get entertainment software included in the Information Technology Agreement of 1996.

The ESA also engages in government lobbying at the state and federal level. According to a Bloomberg report, the ESA spent approximately $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2011 on lobbying efforts in Washington D.C. The ESA has initially been a proponent of the proposed anti-piracy SOPA and PIPA legislation, Red 5 Studios CEO Mark Kern founded the &quot;League For Gamers&quot; (LFG), a rival trade organization, in response. In January 2012, the ESA dropped its support for both SOPA and PIPA, while calling on Congress to craft a more balanced copyright approach.

Gregory Boyd, chairman of the Interactive Entertainment Group at the New York law firm stated, “When it comes to lobbying, the &quot;main industry group&quot; that individual companies defer to is the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which spent $4.83 million on its own in 2012 — more than Facebook, Google, or even the National Rifle Association (NRA).&quot;

The ESA also works to combat and reduce copyright infringement of video game-related works for the companies it represents. This is typically done through sending takedown or cease and desist notices to sites hosting infringing work, and working with search engines like Google to delist sites that host infringing files. They also work with law enforcement agencies to train agents how to handle copyright infringement.

ESA has spoken in favor of the loot box mechanics, arguing that it does not constitute gambling.

== Criticism and controversies ==
The association&#x27;s support for SOPA/PIPA was protested by League of Gamers and boycotting the E3 convention.

On August 3, 2019, it had been found that an unsecured list of personal attendee data was publicly accessible from the ESA&#x27;s site. The list contained the information of over 2000 people, most of them being the press and social media influencers that had attended E3 2019. ESA removed the list after its public visible was found, and apologized for allowing the information to become public. However, using similar techniques to access the 2019 data, users found similar data for over 6000 attendees of past E3 events that were still available on user-authenticated portions of their website; these too were subsequently pulled by ESA once notified.

<doc id="642601" wikidata="Q1137055" url="?curid=642601" title="Zangfu">
<text>The zangfu () organs are functional entities stipulated by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). These classifications are based on east Asian cosmological observations rather than bio medical definitions that are used in Western evidence based medical models. In TCM theory they represent the energetic representation of the internal organs rather than the anatomical viscera that is referred to in Western medicine.

Each &quot;zang&quot; is paired with a &quot;fu&quot;, and each pair is assigned to one of the &quot;wuxing&quot;. The &quot;zangfu&quot; are also connected to the twelve standard meridians – each yang meridian is attached to a &quot;fu&quot; organ and each yin meridian is attached to a &quot;zang&quot;. They are five systems of Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, Kidney.

To highlight the fact that the &quot;zangfu&quot; are not equivalent to the anatomical organs, their names are often capitalized.

==Anatomical organs==
To understand the &quot;zangfu&quot; it is important to realize that their concept did not primarily develop out of anatomical biological considerations but from cosmological patterns and influences. The need to describe and systematize the bodily &quot;functions&quot; was more significant to ancient Chinese physicians than opening up a cadaver (dead body) and seeing what morphological formal structures there actually were. For example traditionally viewing the Heart of pericardium was forbidden. Thus, the &quot;zangfu&quot; are &quot;functional relational entities&quot; first and foremost, and only loosely tied to (rudimentary) anatomical assumptions.

The &quot;zangfu&quot; were originally considered to represent physical organs in &quot;Suwen&quot;. A few rare waves of human dissection throughout Chinese history have contributed some refinements to the rough anatomical assumptions in traditional Chinese medicine, though no fundamental errors were corrected (blood vessels remain mistaken as &quot;thin meridians&quot;). In this context, the influx of western anatomical knowledge lead to a crisis for TCM. This was resolved by &#x27;s introduction of &quot;Zangxiang&quot; () theory in the 1920s, which decoupled the &quot;zangfu&quot; from anatomical organs.

==Yin/yang and the Five Elements==

Each &quot;zangfu&quot; organ has a yin and a yang aspect, but overall, the &quot;zang&quot; organs are considered to be yin, and the &quot;fu&quot; organs yang.

Since the concept of the &quot;zangfu&quot; was developed on the basis of &quot;wuxing&quot; philosophy, they are incorporated into a system of allocation to one of five elemental qualities (i.e., the Five goings or Five Phases). The &quot;zangfu&quot; share their respective element&#x27;s allocations (e.g., diagnostics of colour, sound, odour and emotion etc.) and interact with each other cyclically in the same way the Five Elements do: each &quot;zang&quot; organ has one corresponding &quot;zang&quot; organ that it disperses, and one that it reinforces or tonifying and sedative. 

The correspondence between &quot;zangfu&quot; and Five Elements are stipulated as:

* Fire () = Heart () and Small Intestine () (and, secondarily, Sanjiao [, ‘’Triple Burner‘’] and Pericardium [])
* Earth () = Spleen () and Stomach ()
* Metal () = Lung () and Large Intestine ()
* Water () = Kidney () and Bladder ()
* Wood () = Liver () and Gallbladder ()

==Details==

The &quot;zang&quot; organs&#x27; essential functions consist in manufacturing and storing &quot;qi&quot; and blood (and, in the case of the Kidney, essence). The hollow &quot;fu&quot; organs&#x27; main purpose is to transmit and digest (传化, ) substances (like waste, food, etc.).

===&quot;Zang&quot;===

Each &quot;zang&quot; has a corresponding &quot;orifice&quot; it &quot;opens&quot; into. This means the functional entity of a given &quot;zang&quot; includes the corresponding orifice&#x27;s functions (e.g. blurry vision is primarily seen as a dysfunction of the Liver &quot;zang&quot; because the Liver channel &quot;opens&quot; into the eyes).

In listing the functions of the &quot;zang&quot; organs, TCM regularly uses the term &quot;governing&quot; () – indicating that the main responsibility of regulating something (e.g. blood, &quot;qi&quot;, water metabolism etc.) lies with a certain &quot;zang&quot;.

Although the &quot;zang&quot; are functional entities in the first place, TCM gives vague locations for them – namely, the general area where the anatomical organ of the same name would be found. One could argue that this (or any) positioning of the &quot;zang&quot; is irrelevant for the TCM system; there is some relevance, however, in whether a certain &quot;zang&quot; would be attributed to the upper, middle or lower &quot;jiao&quot;.

====Heart====

The Heart:
*&quot;Stores&quot; (, ) the &quot;shen&quot; (usually translated as &quot;mind&quot;), paired with &quot;small intestines&quot;
*Governs xuě (blood) and vessels/meridians
*Opens into the tongue
*Reflects in facial complexion

=====Pericardium=====

Since there are only five &quot;zang&quot; organs but six yin channels, the remaining meridian is assigned to the Pericardium. Its concept is closely related to the Heart, and its stipulated main function is to protect the Heart from attacks by Exterior Pathogenic Factors. Like the Heart, the Pericardium governs blood and stores the mind. The Pericardium&#x27;s corresponding yang channel is assigned to the San Jiao (&quot;Triple Burner&quot;).

====Spleen====

The Spleen:
*&quot;Stores&quot; () the &quot;yi&quot; ()
*Governs &quot;transportation and transformation&quot; (), i.e. the extraction of &quot;jing wei&quot; (, usually translated with &quot;food essence&quot;, sometimes also called &quot;jing qi&quot; [, &quot;essence qi&quot;]) – and water – from food and drink, and the successive distribution of it to the other &quot;zang&quot; organs.
*Is the source of &quot;production and mutual transformation&quot; () of &quot;qi&quot; and &quot;xue&quot; (blood)
*&quot;Contains&quot; () the blood inside the vessels
*Opens into the lips (and mouth)
*Governs muscles and limbs

====Liver====

The Liver:
*&quot;Stores&quot; () blood, and the &quot;hun&quot; (, Ethereal Soul) and is paired with the gall bladder.
*Governs &quot;unclogging and deflation&quot; () primarily of qì. The free flow and harmony of qì in turn will ensure the free flow of emotions, blood, and water.
*Opens into the eyes
*Governs the tendons
*Reflects in the nails

====Lung====

Yin Metal. Home of the &quot;po&quot; (, Corporeal Soul), paired with the yang organ the &quot;Large Intestine&quot;.

The function of the Lung is to disperse and descend &quot;qi&quot; throughout the body. It receives &quot;qi&quot; through the breath, and exhales the waste and helps the peristaltic action of the gastrointestinal tract.The Lung governs the skin and hair and also governs the exterior (one part of immunity) and the closing of the skin pores. A properly functioning Lung organ will ensure the skin and hair are of good quality and that the immune system is strong and able to fight disease. The normal direction of the Lung is defending, when Lung &quot;qi&quot; &quot;rebels&quot; it goes upwards, causing coughing and wheezing. When the Lung is weak, there can be skin conditions such as eczema, thin or brittle hair, and a propensity to catching colds and flu. The Lung is weakened by dryness and the emotion of grief or sadness.

====Kidney====

Water. Home of the &quot;zhi&quot; (, Will), paired with the &quot;Bladder&quot;.

The Kidneys store &quot;jing&quot; Essence, govern birth, growth, reproduction and development. They also produce the Marrow which fills the spinal cord, brain and control the bones. The Kidneys are often referred to as the &quot;Root of Life&quot; or the &quot;Root of the Pre-Heaven Qi&quot;.

===&quot;Fu&quot;===
====Large intestine====
====Gall bladder====
====Urinary bladder====
====Stomach====
====Small intestine====
====San Jiao (Triple Burner)====
==Criticism==

The concept of the &quot;zangfu&quot; is not identified by evidence based medicine – the underlying assumptions and theory have not been verified or falsified by controlled experiments. As the study and practice of Traditional Chinese medicine&#x27;s mechanisms are comparatively new in the west it has been criticized as pseudoscientific.

<text>The spermaceti organ is an organ present in the heads of toothed whales of the superfamily Physeteroidea, in particular the sperm whale. This organ contains a waxy liquid called spermaceti and is involved in the generation of sound.

== Description ==
In the modern sperm whale (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;), this organ is far larger in proportion to the animal&#x27;s body than what would be explained by simple allometry. Its evolution has caused changes in basal skull morphology, which may implicate that a trade-off was made that compromised the functionality of other features. The high investment in this organ suggests that it has some adaptive advantage, although its function isn&#x27;t yet clearly understood.

The spermaceti organ in sperm whales is shaped like an elongated barrel and sits on top of the whale&#x27;s melon. Historically, the spermaceti oil found within it was used in a variety of products – including lamp oils, candles, and lubricants – providing the economic basis for the sperm whaling industry. A sperm whale may contain as much as of this oil.

The morphology of the nasal complex is believed to be homologous in all of the echolocating Odontoceti (toothed whales), with the spermaceti organ homologous to the dorsal bursa in the dolphin. The hypertrophied quality of the sperm whale&#x27;s nose can be interpreted as an adaptation for deep diving unique to Physeteroidea.

== Hypotheses ==
Two main hypotheses exist for use of the spermaceti organ:

* It assists in controlling buoyancy by manipulating the spermaceti oil&#x27;s temperature and, consequentially, its density, facilitating deep diving by cooling and surfacing by warming, as well as allowing the animal to remain motionless at great depth.
* It aids the whale in echolocation, by functioning as a form of sonar.

The first has been challenged by many authors, with the following points raised as problematic: the change in density that could be achieved by manipulation of spermaceti oil temperature would likely have a negligible impact on the animal&#x27;s overall buoyancy; the anatomical features that would be needed for heat exchange with the spermaceti organ don&#x27;t appear to be present; a mechanism of temperature regulation would necessitate high physical exertion while at great depth, which deep-diving animals tend to avoid; sperm whales appear to be highly active during dives, countering the suggestion that buoyancy manipulation would be advantageous because of its benefit in remaining motionless while diving; and the evolution of the spermaceti organ with buoyancy as a selective pressure would be very difficult and is unlikely due to the fact that the organ wouldn&#x27;t have any impact on buoyancy until it became extremely large in proportion to the body.

Thus, the hypothesis that the organ aids in echolocation is generally more accepted. Under this hypothesis, it assists in echolocation for foraging during deep dives, allowing the whale to manipulate the sound waves&#x27; direction and power to more easily detect prey.

<text>Blantyre is Malawi&#x27;s centre of finance and commerce, and its second largest city, with a population of 800,264 . It is sometimes referred to as the commercial and industrial capital of Malawi as opposed to the political capital, Lilongwe. It is the capital of the country&#x27;s Southern Region as well as the Blantyre District.

== History ==
Blantyre was founded in 1876 through the missionary work of the Church of Scotland. It was named after Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, birthplace of the explorer David Livingstone. The site was chosen by Henry Henderson, who was joined there on 23 October 1876 by Dr T. T. Macklin and others. Dr Macklin took over the leadership of the mission and began the work of building; but it was not until 1878 that the first ordained minister, Rev. Duff MacDonald, joined the mission. The original missionaries, for various reasons, faced local opposition and three of them were recalled.

From 1881–1898 the mission was run by David Clement Scott, who built the St Michael and All Angels Church, Blantyre, between 1888 and 1891, but also for his &quot;Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the Mang&#x27;anja Language&quot;, the foremost dictionary for Mang&#x27;anja and the closely related Chichewa language. It was subsequently edited by Scott&#x27;s successor in Blantyre, Alexander Hetherwick. The church was built by a team of local workmen with no knowledge of European architecture or building techniques.

Alongside the mission a commercial trading company was established. The Livingstonia Central Africa Trading Company, renamed the African Lakes Corporation in 1878, was founded in Glasgow in 1877. In 1881, it moved to Mandala, not far away on the other side of the River Mudi. The company&#x27;s original base in Blantyre, Mandala House, still exists and is a National Monument and the oldest building in Malawi.

Blantyre became a British consular station in 1883 and attained municipality status by 1895, making it Malawi&#x27;s oldest municipality. By the time of World War I, Blantyre had a diverse population with Africans from neighbouring districts as well as South Asian traders.

The city&#x27;s status as Malawi&#x27;s centre of commerce and industry began through its role as a centre for colonial trade in ivory. Thus, Blantyre quickly established itself as a crossroads for trade in Southern Africa. Today the city is Malawi&#x27;s main manufacturing centre for activities including shoe manufacturing, corn (maize) milling, brewing, soft drink production, baking, printing, and tobacco manufacturing.

From 1876 to 1905, urban development in Blantyre was confined to three distinct areas within 2 km of each other: Blantyre Mission, Mandala (European commercial venture), and the government zone and commercial centre triangle marked by Haile Selassie Road, Glyn Jones Road and Hannover Street. In Limbe development started in 1906 following the establishment of the Shire Highlands Railways Company headquarters and repair and servicing facilities and Imperial Tobacco Group (ITG) packaging and tobacco grading factory nearby. As a result of the establishment of these large operations, easy accessibility and flat topography, Limbe experienced a development boom of Indian wholesale and retail shops. By 1910 Limbe town surpassed Blantyre town. Low- and medium-density housing for the European and Asian staff was in Mpingwe, ITG and Mudi in Limbe and in Mount Pleasant, Sunnyside, Namiwawa, Kabula and Mandala in Blantyre. The Indian shops included accommodation at the rear or on the top floor. High-density housing for the African workforce was far away except the Chiwembe compound in Limbe.

The development history of Blantyre was principally dictated by piecemeal uncoordinated development as a result of individual and interest group decisions relating to evangelism, commerce, farming, industry and administration.

Urban development in Blantyre was further stimulated by the construction of the railway. In 1956 it was merged with its sister city, Limbe ( east, founded in 1909), to form one city. Here, it became the &quot;headquarter of Malawi (then Nyasaland) Railways.&quot;

Blantyre City has a total of eight National Monuments, mostly buildings of historic importance. The City Assembly has nominated two sites for designation as National Monuments and another 23 sites for investigation with regard to their eligibility for designation as national and local monuments.

==Demographics==
===Population growth===
===Ethnic groups===

According to the 2018 census, the Lomwe are the largest ethnic group in the city with 39.59% of the population. The largest ethnic minority are the Ngoni with 19.12% of the population. Other minor ethnic groups include the Yao with 14.32%, Chewa with 9.34%, Sena with 5.74%, Mang&#x27;anja with 4.26%, Tumbuka with 4.01%, Tonga with 1.24%, Nyanja with 0.87%, Nkhonde with 0.34%, Lambya with 0.2%, Sukwa with only 0.02%, and other ethnic groups with 0.93% of the city&#x27;s population.

===Religion===

The largest religious denomination in Blantyre City is Catholicism with 17.94% of the city. The largest religious minority is Church of Central Africa Presbyterian with 17.61%. Other minority religions include Seventh-day Adventist, Baptist, and Apostolic with 15.44% combined, Pentecostal with 9.75%, Anglican with 1.7%, other Christian with 24.33%, Islam with 10.11%, Traditional with only 0.08%, other religions with 2.41%, and no religion with 0.63% of the city.

== Geography ==
Blantyre City, the largest commercial and industrial capital of Malawi, is in the Shire Highlands and geographical centre of the Southern Region of the country and lies 35° east of Greenwich Meridian and 15° 42&#x27; south of the Equator. It is a transport communications node with road, rail and air links to all parts of the country and neighbouring countries of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania. It covers an area of 228 km2. The city is classified as a &#x27;National Urban Centre&#x27; within the designated six hierarchical levels system of urban centres of the country and is the regional administrative headquarters of the Southern Region.

The geology of the city consists of two principal types of rocks of an ancient Basement Complex, a result of a process that took place during the late Pre-Cambrian period about 500 million years ago. The most extensive rock formation consists of pyroxene granulite gneiss that covers more than 50% of the city area, from the northwest to the east and extends in two small bands southward in the western part of the city. Syenitic gneiss accounts for about 40% covering the southern, western and north-eastern corner of the city and also in form of scattered small intrusions into the pyroxene granulite gneiss. In their unweathered state, both rock types are impervious hence poor aquifers, but they provide a valuable resource for road and building construction. Blantyre City is on the eastern edge of the southern branch of the Eastern African Rift, and thus some prominent faults occur within and in the vicinity of the city rendering it prone to earthquakes. The main faults and associated zones of deeply fractured bedrock run from the north of the city in a southwesterly direction and are potential aquifers for groundwater.

Blantyre City lies in a hilly area; it has varied topography ranging from an elevation of about 780 to 1,612 metres above sea level. There are three main types of topographical features, which have major implications for the development of the city: the hills, plateau and ridge, and the natural drainage system.

The most conspicuous and dominant physical features are the numerous hills found in all parts of the city. The main hills are the headwaters of several rivers and streams that originate and radiate from the city, forming a natural drainage system with nine distinct catchment areas: Likhubula, Lunzu, Mombezi and Khombwi, which drain the northern part of the city, and Mudi, Chisombezi, Limbe, Luchenza and Mwampanzi draining the middle and southern parts. Because of the hilly topography, these natural drainage channels are narrow and have steep sides and gradients.

The plateau and ridge comprises all the land that is suitable for urban development including extensive relatively flat land, the mountain piedmonts and plains, and long narrow watersheds and strips of land that separate the rivers and streams.

Its rather unconventional location has meant that Blantyre is surrounded by Mount Soche, Ndirande mountain, Chiradzulu mountain and Michiru Mountain, which constitute the Michiru Mountain Conservation Area.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Blantyre is classified by Köppen-Geiger climate classification system as a Tropical climate, more specifically a tropical savanna climate (Aw) and is greatly influenced by its location in the tropical zone and altitude. The city experiences the tropical continental climate with two distinct seasons in the year (three proper seasons). The rainy season is from November to April, with continuing light cold showers locally known as chiperoni from the end of May to July. The dry season is from May to October. The mean annual rainfall is , of which about 80% falls within months between November and March.

The city is generally cool with mean monthly temperatures ranging from during the cool season (May to July) to during the hot season (September to November). There are two particularly uncomfortable spells of weather; the hottest season associated with high humidity soon before the onset of the first rains (end October to November), and the frost along rivers, mist and chilly showers and winds characteristic of the cold season in June and July.

== Economy ==

Blantyre City is the commercial and industrial capital. It is by far the major employment generator in the country and has the greatest multiplier effect on the urban economy. The city is Malawi&#x27;s industrial centre with many manufacturing plants, having eight designated industrial areas: Makata, Ginnery Corner, Maselema, Limbe, Chirimba, South Lunzu, Maone and Chitawira. Of these Makata, Ginnery Corner, Maselema, Limbe, Chirimba and Maone are actively hosting industries whilst South Lunzu is yet to be developed.

The existing industrial sites are further categorised into heavy and light sites. Makata and Limbe, for example, are the sole heavy industrial sites hosting more than 30 companies.

While Chirimba industrial area is designated a heavy industrial area, it is the least developed in terms of number of industries. Apart from Makata, Ginnery corner industrial site is another active site followed by Limbe and Maselema. The least are Chirimba and Maone industrial sites. Chitawira and Maselema are classic examples of light industrial areas. All the industrial areas are located along the banks of the main rivers or streams of Blantyre city. Makata industrial area lies between Mudi and Nasolo streams whilst Ginnery Corner industrial area is along Mudi River. Maselema industrial area exists along the Naperi river and Chirimba stream hosts Chirimba industrial area.

There are several rules for treatment of wastes in the industries, but disposal of untreated wastewater into drains and, subsequently, into the city&#x27;s major streams is very common, thus posing a potential health and environmental risk to the people in Blantyre and downstream. Other sources of water pollution in the city such as run-offs from domestic and agricultural activities and vehicle emissions have been identified. Previous studies have indicated substantial heavy metal pollution in the city&#x27;s water bodies including streams. Major changes in industrial activities have occurred in the city including a decrease in volumes of wastewater generated by the David Whitehead company, which used to be a major contributor of wastewater effluent in Makata industrial area; change of ownership and wastewater management of Cold Storage Company; closure of the Shire Bus Line; doubling of wastewater generation from both Carlsberg and Chibuku Products due to increase in production and installation of some industrial pre-treatment plants such as at Chibuku, Plascon and Dulux.

Manufacturing contributes approximately 14% to GDP. In the period 1996–1999 the sector showed 0% growth, partly due to the rapid liberalisation of markets exposing Malawi&#x27;s manufacturers to competition from South Africa and Zimbabwe. The sector is still hampered by monopolistic behaviour (cotton), trade barriers, lack of access to capital, illegal imports, and unpredictable implementation or lack of implementation of existing bilateral trade agreements.
The employment structure includes formal and informal sectors, together offering employment that is estimated to be between 50,000 and 55,000 jobs and absorbing 62% of the labour force. The formal sector employment consists of primary, secondary and tertiary industry sub-sectors, and the informal sector is principally small-scale business operations. The tertiary or services industry sub-sector is leading in terms of employment creation and importance to the economy of the city; it employs 26,074 people accounting for 56.5% of total formal employment. The secondary industry sub-sector employs 18,824 people principally in manufacturing and accounts for about 41% of the total employment. Information on informal sector activities is scanty or non-existent. But a recent study by Africon and field investigation under the Blantyre City Environmental City Profile, leads to the conclusion that it is a substantial and vibrant economy, offering employment to about 4,500 people who would otherwise be unemployed.

Blantyre is home to the Malawi Stock Exchange located on Victoria Avenue, the heart of the city. It opened its doors in November 1996 and operates under the Capital Market Development Act 1990 and the Companies Act 1984. Before the listing of the first company, the major activities that were being undertaken were the provision of a facility for secondary market trading in Government of Malawi bonds, namely Treasury Bills and Local Registered Stocks.

As Malawi&#x27;s main economic and financial hub, the city plays host to an annual international trade fair each May. The event seeks to showcase the best of Malawian commerce, industry, agriculture and information technology and opened under a theme of &quot;Building Productivity Capacity to Achieve Export Competitiveness&quot; in 2007.

According to the Mercer 2017 and Preciousgift Kulumbasi, Cost of Living Rankings, Blantyre is the city with the fifth-lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world.

==Sport facilities==
Malawi&#x27;s largest stadium (Bingu International Stadium) is in the capital city of Lilongwe. Construction finished in 2016 and it is estimated to hold 70,000 people. The stadium is home to the Malawi Flames, the country&#x27;s national football team. It is also used for track and field events as well as the majority of the important functions of the nation.

Malawi&#x27;s second-largest stadium, Kamuzu Stadium, which holds an estimated 40,000, is in Chichiri, Blantyre. Due to the age of the structure, however, it has been downsized to seat an estimated 25,000. International football games are played here as well as major Malawian events such as presidential inaugurations and Independence Day celebrations. Other sports centres are College of medicine sports complex, Blantyre Youth centre and the Chiwembe Sports complex.

== Transport ==

The city has an important railway station on the Sena railway, which connects it by operating a connection between Blantyre to Nsanje, near the southern border with Mozambique, and connects Malawi with the Mozambican ports of Beira and Nacala; Mchinji, near the border with Zambia; Salima and Lilongwe; and between Nkaya and Nayuchi on the eastern border with Mozambique, covering a total of .

Chileka International Airport, located approximately from Blantyre city centre, has two runways and serves Blantyre with flights to South Africa, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya, and domestic points. The airport is the second base for the country&#x27;s flagship airline, Malawian Airlines. Chileka airport also houses important weather stations. In 2007, the Government of Malawi proposed expansion plans that are yet to be realised. In 2009 it was announced that the Government of Malawi was seeking partners for a $1 billion rehabilitation of the airport, which will include the construction of a new terminal building and the widening of the current runway.

The city has coach services that run from the city centre and Wenela bus station to Lilongwe, Mzuzu and other African cities including Johannesburg and Harare.

== Culture ==
The Mandala House is a historic building in Blantyre that was built in 1882 as a place of relaxation for the managers of the Mandala Trading Company. Inside there is a cafe, as well as the Society of Malawi Library and Archive. The Chichiri Museum is located in the city. Carlsberg Brewery is a location where visitors can try the country&#x27;s favourite drink, the &quot;Green&quot;. This drink was created by a Danish foreign minister who visited Malawi during the independence celebration in 1966.

== Places of worship ==

Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Lutheran Church of Central Africa (Lutheran World Federation), Church of Central Africa Presbyterian (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Baptist Convention of Malawi (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Blantyre (Catholic Church). There are also Muslim mosques.

== Education ==

Blantyre City has a wide range of educational facilities comprising primary school, secondary school and tertiary education as well as pre-school. These are provided by the government, City Assembly, missionary institutions and the private sector.

Tertiary education includes technical and higher learning institutions mostly in the Chichiri-Ginnery Corner area, the then Malawi Polytechnic now Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences (MUBAS), University of Malawi College of Medicine, Kamuzu College of Nursing, Blantyre School of Health Sciences and Malawi College of Accountancy, Telecommunications National and SADCC Multi-Country Training Schools, Technical School, Police Training School and Blantyre Teachers&#x27; College.

Schools include Bedir International School, Saint Andrews International Primary and Saint Andrews International High School, Central High School, Nyasa Junior Academy, St Patrick&#x27;s Primary School, St Patrick&#x27;s Academy, South End Secondary School, Phoenix Primary School, Hillview International Primary School in Limbe and Kalibu Academy.

== Health ==
The health care delivery system in the city has both curative and preventative health care services, and this is provided through a network of hospitals and health centres/clinics that are distributed throughout different parts of the city. The government runs Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), the biggest referral hospital in the country, which has a total of 1,000 hospital beds, and the three private hospitals that have a total of 122 hospital beds. The 18 public clinics are run by the District Health Office in partnership with the Blantyre City Assembly and service Bangwe, Chigumula, Chilomoni, Chirimba, Limbe, Ndirande, Manyowe, Masala, Mapanga, Misesa, Mzedi, Nancholi, Nkolokoti, Ntenje, Ntonda, South Lunzu, Zingwangwa and Civic Centre.

There are several clinics run by religious organisations where people receive paying health care services, and there are also clinics owned by statutory corporations/companies (serving their staff) such as ADMARC, Malawi Railways, Portland Cement, Lever Brothers, Tobacco Processors, and National Seed Company of Malawi. Following the liberalisation policy, the city has witnessed the establishment of many private clinics and hospitals (including Blantyre Adventist Hospital and Mwaiwathu PVT Hospital) that complement the few limited old facilities. The majority of these offer outpatient services while the few well-established ones offer both. Besides the city-based health services, many city residents make regular use of mission hospitals that are outside the city to the extent that these form part of the city&#x27;s health delivery system (Mlambe Hospital and Nguludi). In addition, traditional healers (herbalists) and traditional birth attendants play an important role in providing health care to the city residents.

The health delivery system of the city is grossly inadequate. The public hospital wards are very congested and long queues are characteristic of outpatient services.

Mwaiwathu Private Hospital and Blantyre Adventist Hospital provide the best medical services in the city, with many residents of Lilongwe travelling to Blantyre to receive treatment from them. There is also the Beit CURE International Hospital, one of the very few hospitals where hip and knee replacement surgery can be done in Sub-Saharan Africa.

<text>Karonga is a township in the Karonga District in Northern Region of Malawi. Located on the western shore of Lake Nyasa, it was established as a slaving centre sometime before 1877. As of 2018 estimates, Karonga has a population of 61,609. The common and major language spoken in this district is the Tumbuka language, which is also a regional language of Northern Malawi.

==History==
Pre-historic tools and remains of hominids discovered in Malawi&#x27;s remote northern district of Karonga provides further proof that the area could be the cradle of humankind. Professor Friedemann Schrenk of the Goethe University in Frankfurt told Reuters News that two students working on the excavation site in September 2009 had discovered prehistoric tools and a tooth of a hominid. &quot;This latest discovery of prehistoric tools and remains of hominids provides additional proof to the theory that the Great Rift Valley of Africa and perhaps the excavation site near Karonga can be considered the cradle of humankind.&quot; Schrenk said. The site also contains some of the earliest dinosaurs which lived between 100 million and 140 million years ago and early hominids believed to have lived between a million and 6 million years ago. The discovery was at Malema excavation site from Karonga.

In terms of more recent prehistory, Karonga has an abundance of Pleistocene and Holocene archaeological materials dating especially to the Middle and Later Stone Ages, as well as the Iron Age.

Some time before 1877 Karonga existed as the stronghold of Mlozi, a famous Arab slaver. In 1883 a British trading post, which formed the basis of the modern town, was opened there. British explorer Sir Harry Johnston bought the post in 1895 and ended the slave trade on Lake Nyasa&#x27;s western shore. At this point Karonga became an important commercial and agricultural centre. According to &quot;Lonely Planet&quot;, the town &quot;still bears a strong Swahili-Arab influence today.&quot;

On 11 July 2008 the Kayelekera mine in Karonga celebrated 1.5 million hours of accident-free uranium mining. &quot;Analysts&quot; claim this is a rare achievement. The mine previously met with controversy due to exposing people to radiation.

In December 2009 the area suffered a series of earthquakes.

==Geography==
Karonga is at an elevation of on the western shore of Lake Nyasa. It is situated from Kenan Ngomba, from Kaporo, from Kilondo and from Lupembe.

==Demographics==

Tumbuka is commonly used in Karonga for both home and school. Karonga is known as &quot;&quot;an island of Tumbuka language and culture in a sea of Ngonde people&quot;.&quot;

==Economy==
The economy of the area is based on cotton, rice and maize production along the lake and on coffee and livestock in the west. Karongans are dependent on subsistence fishing.

==Climate==

Karonga&#x27;s climate is classified as tropical. The summers are much rainier than the winters in Karonga. The climate here is classified as Aw by the Köppen-Geiger system. In Karonga, the average annual temperature is 25.6 °C (78.8 °F).

==Arts and culture==
The Cultural &amp; Museum Centre Karonga is Karonga&#x27;s most popular attraction to tourists. It is home to the Malawisaurus, a 150-million-year-old fossil discovered south of Karonga. It displays an exhibit entitled &quot;From Dinosaurs to Democracy&quot;, which chronicles the area&#x27;s history.

<doc id="642608" wikidata="Q7669730" url="?curid=642608" title="The body in traditional Chinese medicine">
<text>The model of the body in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has the following elements:
* the Fundamental Substances;
* Qi, ( Energy), Jing (Essence), Shen (Spirit) that nourish and protect the Zang-Fu organs;
* and the meridians (&quot;jing-luo&quot;) which connect and unify the body.

Every diagnosis is a &quot;Pattern of disharmony&quot; that affects one or more organs, such as &quot;Spleen Qi Deficiency&quot; or &quot;Liver Fire Blazing&quot; or &quot;Invasion of the Stomach by Cold&quot;, and every treatment is centered on correcting the disharmony.

The traditional Chinese model is concerned with function. Thus, the TCM Spleen is not a specific piece of flesh, but an aspect of function related to transformation and transportation within the body, and of the mental functions of thinking and studying. Indeed, the San Jiao or Triple Burner has no anatomical correspondent at all, and is said to be completely a functional entity.

Chinese medicine and the model of the body is founded on the balance of the five elements: Earth, Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire. The elements are infinitely linked, consuming and influencing each other. Each element corresponds to different organs in the body. The organs act as representatives of the qualities of different elements, which impact the physical and mental body in respective ways. Each organ is categorized as either Yin or Yang. The energies of Yin and Yang are conflicting yet inter-reliant. When the two (Yin+Yang) forces are united they create a divine energy, which supports the flow of all life.

Yin organs represent: femininity, coldness, compression, darkness, and submission.
Yang organs represent: masculinity, expansion, heat, motion, and action.

This duality (yin+yang) must be in balance or else disease of the mind and body will occur.

Each organ governs energy channels, which distribute qi and connect all parts of the body to one another. These channels are called meridians.

== Wood ==
Wood is an element of growth, originality, creativity, and evolution.

The Liver (1) and the Gallbladder (2) are the two wood-governed organs in the body.

(1) The Liver, a Yin organ, influences emotional flexibility and the flow of energy on a cellular level.

The organ has a strong impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the immune system along with storing the body&#x27;s blood, a physical manifestation of one&#x27;s true self. The Liver rules one&#x27;s direction, vision, sense of self-purpose and opens into the eyes. Lastly, the Liver absorbs what is not digested and regulates blood sugar. Imbalance in the Liver can lead to great problems.

Moodiness, anger, pain, poor self-esteem, lack of direction, addiction, and indecision are all associated with the Liver organ. Muscle spasms, numbness, tremors, eye diseases, hypertension, allergies, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis are also a result of Liver imbalances.

The Liver Meridian begins on the big toe, runs along the inner leg through the genitals and ends on the chest.

(2) The Gallbladder, a wood controlled Yang organ, governs decisiveness and judgement.

The Gallbladder also stores bile. Imbalance of the Gallbladder can lead to indecisiveness along with obesity.

The Gallbladder meridian begins at the outer edge of the eye, moves to the side of the head and trunk, and ends on the outside of the fourth toe.

== Fire ==
Fire is an element of transformation, demolition, primal power, and divinity.

(1)The Heart, (2) Small Intestine are the organs that fire controls.
(3) Heart Protector, (4) Triple Heater are organs that secondary (ministerial) fire controls.

(1) The Heart, a Yin organ, regulates the pulse, manifests in the face and tongue, and bridges the connection between the human and the celestial.

Dysfunction of the Heart leads to insomnia, disturbance of the spirit, and an irregular pulse.

The Heart Meridian begins in the chest moves to the inner aspect of the arm down to the palm of the hand and ends on the pinky.

(2)The Small Intestine, a Yang organ, separates pure food and fluid essences from the polluted.

The pure essences are distributed to the spleen while the polluted are sent to the bladder and the large intestine.

Dysfunction of the Small Intestine can lead to bowel problems and a sense of distrust of one&#x27;s self.

The Small Intestine Meridian begins on the pinky, moves to the underside of the arm, up to the top of the shoulder blade, the neck, and ends on the front of the ear.

(3) The Heart Protector, a Yin organ, shields the heart. It filters psychic inclinations and stabilizes emotions.

A problem with the Heart Protector can lead to anxiety and heart palpitations.

The Heart Protector Meridian begins on the chest, travels through the armpit to the arm and ends on the top of the middle finger.

(4) The Triple Heater, a Yang organ, disperses fluids throughout the body and regulates the relationship between all organs.

The Triple Heater Meridian begins on the ring finger, moves up the back of the arm to the side of the neck, goes around the ear and ends of the eyebrow.

== Earth ==
Earth is an element of fertility, cultivation, femininity, and wrath.

Earth governs the Spleen (1) and the Stomach (2).

(1) The Spleen, a Yin organ, regulates digestion and the metabolism. It also holds the flesh and organs in their proper place while directing the movement of ascending fluids and essences. Mentally, the Spleen aids in concentration.

Imbalance of the Spleen leads worry and pensive behaviour, chi deficiencies, diarrhea, organ prolapses, and headaches, 

The Spleen Meridian begins at the big toe, moves to the inner aspect of the leg, up to the front of the torso, and ends on the side of the trunk.

(2) The Stomach, the most active yang organ, breaks down food and controls the descending movement of chi.

Imbalance of the stomach leads to vomiting and belching.

The Stomach Meridian begins below the eye, moves down the front of the face, torso, to the outer part of the leg, and ends on the third toe.

== Metal ==
Metal is an element of purity, treasure, and masculinity.

Metal controls the Lungs (1) and the Large Intestine (2).

(1) The Lungs, a Yin organ, draws in pure chi by inhalation and eliminates impurities by exhalation. The lungs also disperse bodily fluids, defend the body from a cold or flu, govern the sense of smell, and open in the nose.

Dysfunction of the Lungs leads to colds, the flu, phlegm, and asthma.

The Lung Meridian begins at the chest moves to the inner arm, palm, and ends on the thumb.

(2) The Large Intestine, a Yang organ, controls the removal of waste and feces.

Imbalance in the Large Intestine leads to constipation, diarrhea and the inability to emotionally detach and let go.

The Large Intestine Meridian begins on the forefinger, moves to the back of the arm, shoulder, side of the neck, cheek, and ends beside the opposite nostril.

== Water ==
Water is an element of life and death.

Water governs the Kidneys (1) and the Bladder (2).

(1) The Kidneys, a Yin organ, are the source of all the Yin and Yang energy in the body.

The Kidneys also govern the endocrine system, receive air from the lungs, govern bones, govern teeth, control water in the body, and store essence. Dysfunction of the Kidneys leads to deficiencies of Yin or Yang.

It also leads to imbalanced hormones, weak bones, an impaired sex drive, and dizziness. Water in excess leads to bipolar disorder. Depressive episodes are characterized by Kidney Yin excess while manic episodes are characterized by Kidney Yang excess.

The Kidney Meridian begins on the sole, moves up the inner leg to the groin, up the trunk, and ends under the collarbone.

(2) The Bladder, a Yang organ, stores and removes fluid from the body by receiving Kidney chi.

Imbalance of the Bladder leads to frequent or uncontrolled urination.

The Bladder Meridian begins in the corner of the eye, moves down the back, and ends on the back of the knee. The Bladder also has another line, which starts alongside the previous line, moves down to the outer edge of the foot and ends on the small toe.

Rumphi is noted for the kindness of the people (it is even rude to pass by someone without greeting them). It is directly on the way to Nyika National Park, Nyika Plateau, and Vwaza Marsh Game Reserve.

The town is bounded by the Rumphi river in the east and the South Rukuru River in the south.

Rumphi is famous for the cattle market. On every Saturday morning at 6:00 a.m. farmers and dealers are coming from far to sell and buy cattle. It is the biggest cattle market between Lilongwe, Karonga, and Mzimba. Along the road to Bolero, opposite the FDH Bank is Roscher Youth Development Centre and on its plot to the South Rukuru River the Support Malawi e.V. foundation initiated the first Earthbag House Lodge in Rumphi built by the youth with walls of stacked sand bags. In addition an Earthbag Restaurant got attractive for visitors of the park-like area at the river as well as residents of the nice lodges.
Around Rumphi you find many tobacco fields as well as fields of maize, groundnuts, cassava, potatoes and much more.

<text>Mosaik is a German comic book magazine. First published in December 1955, it is the longest-running German (and European) monthly comic book and the only one originating in East Germany that still exists. &quot;Mosaik&quot; also appeared in other countries and other languages. In its English-language edition it was published under the title &quot;Mosaic&quot;.

&quot;Mosaik&quot; was created by illustrator and caricaturist Hannes Hegen. From 1955 to 1975, the protagonists of &quot;Mosaik&quot; were Dig, Dag and Digedag, known together as the Digedags. They were replaced in 1976 by Abrax, Brabax and Califax, known together as the Abrafaxe, who are still the main characters today.

More than 200 million issues have been sold from 1955 until today. At the height of its popularity, prior to German reunification, &quot;Mosaik&quot; had a print run of almost a million copies per month. After reunification, the print run has varied from more than 100,000 in the early 1990s to about 80,000 in 2007.

==Digedags years==
The East German publisher Verlag Neues Leben, in East Berlin, had wanted to counter Western comics and magazines with a magazine of their own when Hannes Hegen approached them with his ideas for &quot;Mosaik&quot; and the Digedags. Reaching an agreement with Neues Leben, Hegen created the first issue of &quot;Mosaik&quot; for publishing in December 1955. &quot;Mosaik&quot; was published quarterly until July 1957, when it switched to a monthly schedule that has continued uninterrupted to this day. To support the schedule, the publisher hired additional artists, colorists and writers to support Hegen – a team which became known as the &quot;Mosaik-Kollektiv&quot; (&quot;Mosaik Collective&quot;). Only Hegen was credited on the cover, however.

==Abrafaxe years==
In 1975, Hegen left the publisher over a disagreement and took the rights to the Digedags characters with him. The Mosaik-Kollektiv, not wanting to end publication of &quot;Mosaik&quot;, together created new characters to replace the Digedags. The final versions of the Abrafaxe were created by writer Lothar Dräger and artist Lona Rietschel. During the half-year period of creating the new characters and stories, reprints of old Digedags stories were run in &quot;Mosaik&quot;, until the new characters premiered in January 1976.

== English-language editions ==
The English editions of &quot;Mosaik&quot; have mostly appeared mostly under the name &quot;Mosaic&quot;. Of Hannes Hegen&#x27;s &quot;Mosaik&quot;, issue 105, &quot;Die Seeräuberburg&quot;, was issued in a limited run in 1965 in English as &quot;The Pirates Castle&quot;. According to a former staff member at the publishing house, this was intended as a promotional issue for the United States market. An agreement had been reached to publish the comic books in the US; however, because of the US policy of economic embargo policy against Eastern European states in the Cold War, the contract could not be fulfilled.

Ten anthology volumes of Hegen&#x27;s &quot;Mosaik&quot; were published in English for the international market under the name Mosaic Comic Books:

# &quot;The Digedags in America&quot;
# &quot;The Digedags on the Mississippi&quot;
# &quot;The Digedags and the Indians&quot;
# &quot;The Digedags in the Rocky Mountains&quot;
# &quot;The Digedags in New Orleans&quot;
# &quot;The Digedags on the Missouri&quot;
# &quot;The Digedags and the Golden Treasure&quot;
# &quot;The Digedags in Panama&quot;
# &quot;The Digedags and the Pirate Island&quot;
# &quot;The Digedags in New York&quot;

In the mid-1980s, 42 &quot;Mosaic&quot; books were published in English in the GDR for India. There is also a promotional flyer for these issues, which states that the &quot;Mosaic&quot; with the Abrafaxe is published in English and Arabic in addition to German, advertises for subscriptions, and includes an order form.

<text>Mchinji is a town and the capital of the Mchinji District in the Central Region of Malawi. Mchinji Boma, located from the Zambian border and from the national capital, Lilongwe, is the major hub of government and general business. It has a major railroad junction, being the railhead nearest to Zambia. The area&#x27;s economy is sustained by rain-fed agriculture.

==History==

Mchinji Boma was formerly known as Fort Manning, after governor William Manning. Fort Manning was called a &quot;fort&quot; because the local government offices (the &quot;boma&quot;) were once fortified.

In 1930, Fort Manning was attacked by a lion that caused over thirty-six deaths over a five-month period.

A magnitude 6.6 earthquake struck Mchinji on 10 March 1989. At least 9 people were killed, 100 injured and about 50,000 left homeless in Malawi. It was also felt in Zambia.

American pop singer Madonna adopted 13-month-old David Banda from Mchinji in October 2006. This generated international controversy because Malawian law stated that one year of residence was required of potential adoptive parents. The effort was highly publicised and culminated in legal disputes.

On 19 June 2008 Gillian Merron, the British Minister for International Development, responsible for Africa, visited Mchinji and spoke about maternal health and the challenges faced by residents.

==Geography==
Mchinji Boma lies at an elevation of , from the Zambian border. It is situated away from Katambo, away from Kadulama Lambo, away from Daka and away from Tsumba.

==Demographics==
===Population development===
===Languages===
Chichewa is the main language spoken in Mchinji.
Senga is spoken by some quarters of the population and Ngoni is also spoken by some major population surrounding Mchinji Boma

==Economy==
Mchinji is described as &quot;dirt poor&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot;. Harvesting rain-fed agriculture is the main occupation in Mchinji, with groundnuts, tobacco, soya and casava beans being the primary cash crops. Maize, yams, velvet beans and pumpkin are prominent food crops. During the dry season, secondary activities are pursued, such as brick-making, beer brewing, bicycle repair and carpentry. Due to a food shortage partially caused by the region&#x27;s many droughts and partially caused by poor government planning, a UNDP rural development program was established in Mchinji. Mchinji is currently the location of a pilot project of a social cash transfer to benefit very poor members of rural areas.

==Politics And Traditional Authority Areas==
There are 10 Traditional Authorities namely; Mkanda, Mavwere, Zulu, Mlonyeni, Pitala, Simphasi, Dambe, Kapondo, Mduwa, Mponda and Nyoka.

The Members for the Malawian National Assembly are six in total. They are for Honorable Kayo Zimchetera East Constituency (in Traditional Authorities Mduwa, Mponda and Nyoka), Honorable Rachel Zulu Mazombwe for Mchinji North Constituency (in Traditional Authorities Mkanda and Pitala), Honorable Alex Chitete for Mchinji North East Constituency (in Traditional Authorities Kapondo and Dambe), Honorable Jerome Waluza for Mchinji South Constituency (in Traditional Authority Mavwere), Honorable Mussa Banda for Mchinji South West Constituency (in Traditional authority Mlonyeni), and Honorable Teleza Mwale for Mchinji West Constituency (in Traditional Authorities Zulu and Simphasi). The members are from the Peoples Party, Malawi Congress Party and Democrat Progressive Party.

Local politician Agnes Nkusa Nkhoma was elected in 2019 for the south constituency (Mabvere) after obtaining 5,000 votes. She had unsuccessfully stood in 2009. She would become a deputy minister. She was supported by the Malawi Congress Party.

===Orphanage===
The Mchinji Mission Orphanage, popularly known as the &quot;Home of Hope&quot;, is one of the largest children&#x27;s homes in Malawi. Reverend Thomson Chipeta, remembering losing both his parents, brought orphaned children into his home in 1992 and construction of an orphanage began in 1998. As of 2007, there are six large residential houses, a dining/assembly hall, a clinic, classrooms for nursery, primary and secondary classes, and staff housing. &quot;Baby David&quot; lived in the orphanage prior to being adopted by Madonna. The children are divided into different houses and each house has its own &#x27;amayi&#x27;. An amayi acts as the house mother for the children. Each morning all the children must attend a daily devotion, in which there will be much singing and praying. Following the devotion ceremony the children will all line up outside the &#x27;kitchen&#x27; where they will get nsima for their breakfast. Nsima, maize and beans is typically what they will eat for every meal. Not all children living at the orphanage are &#x27;orphans&#x27;, many still have family however they are unable to provide basic necessities so they send them to Home of Hope. During summer vacation and other holidays many of the children will return to their villages to spend time with their family.

===Education===
The &quot;Home of Hope&quot; provides a primary school to its residents. Due to a shortage in secondary schools in Malawi, the orphanage built one in January 2006 to cater to all residents in the surrounding area. Children are taught in smaller groups than at government schools and have November and December off. In March 2007, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) donated 600 textbooks to that secondary school. In 2014, American charitable organisation Youth of Malawi, Inc. built a solar-rain water harvesting primary school in Chimphamba Village, Mchinji, for 180 first and second graders.

===Religion===
Roman Catholic is dominant in the district with Parishes such as Guilime, Ludzi, Kapiri, Kamangilira, Kachebere, Mkanda and Mchinji Boma. It has a Major Catholic Seminary Called KACHEBERE. Other churches are Presbyterian, Pentecostal and few Muslims. Kamangilira Women&#x27;s Catholic Choir is the best in the district.

===Medical===
Mchinji Hospital is the only medical facility for several miles. According to actress Claire Sweeney, mothers &quot;only come here if their children are really sick because work on the farm nearly always comes first.&quot; As of 2008, the children&#x27;s ward of the hospital contains 185 children suffering from malaria, pneumonia or anaemia. Patients at the hospital are fed a blend of milk, protein and medicine. The hospital does not have beds for those accompanying the sick, cooking or washing facilities, although in early 2008 a brick shelter was created to protect parents from nature.

==Transport==
Mchinji was previously the railhead nearest the Zambian border, after the railway from Lilongwe was extended to Mchinji in 1980. In September 2010, an extension of the Sena railway was opened to the border town of Chipata, providing a new rail access point to Zambia via Mchinji. The idea of a Mchinji-Chipata railway was conceived in 1982 as part of a bilateral project between Zambia and Malawi, and the Malawi section of the railroad was completed in 1984, though Zambia did not actively pursue the project until 2006.

Minibuses run from Mchinji to Lilongwe, and local shared taxis can be taken from Mchingi to the Zambian border. A water transport system existed from Lilongwe to Mchinji, though Bakili Muluzi favoured road transport and the system was dropped. The nearest airport is at Lilongwe, away, although there is a closer airstrip at Chipata.

As of May 2020, the Malawi Revenue Authority indicated that the one-stop-border post (OSP), under construction at Mchinji would be completed by December 2020. The OSP will benefit Mwami, Zambia and Mchinji, Malawi crossings. It was built with US$5.8 million, borrowed from the African Development Bank.

<text>Nkhotakota (Un-kho-tah-kho-tuh) (formerly Kota Kota) (name derived from the Chichewa for &quot;Corner Corner&quot;) is a town and one of the districts in the Central Region of Malawi. It is on the shore of Lake Malawi (formerly Lake Nyasa) and is one of the main ports on Lake Malawi. As of 2018, Nkhotakota had a population estimated at 28,350. The district had a population of 301,000.

==History==

Nkhotakota was originally a group of villages in the 19th century which later served as a market for Swahili-Arabian slave traders. David Livingstone convinced Chief Jumbe to stop trading slaves under a tree in Nkhotakota in the 19th century, which is currently in existence under a mission. Later Malawi president Hastings Banda gave speeches under another tree in Nkhotakota during the 1960s, this one ironically known as the Livingstone Tree. This town was hit by the 2001 floods, and was the worst hit area of Malawi&#x27;s Central region. Today, Nkhotakota is the largest traditional African town in Malawi and bears a strong Swahili-Arab influence.

==Geography==

Nkhotakota lies at an elevation of on the shore of Lake Malawi. It is located on a rocky ridge overlooking a natural harbour overlooking Nkhotakota Bay, formed by a sandbar. In addition, Nkhotakota is from Lilongwe, Malawi&#x27;s capital, and from Blantyre, Malawi&#x27;s largest city.

==Wildlife==
Nkhotakota is home to the Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve, where, according to Lonely Planet, one has a good chance of seeing elephants. The reserve is also home to several antelope species, buffalo, and leopards. Several large rivers cross this reserve, the largest in Malawi.

Roughly south of Nkhotakota is the Chia Lagoon, a large bay linked to Lake Malawi by a narrow channel, crossed by a bridge near Nkhotakota&#x27;s one major road.

==Economy==
The biggest formal &#x27;private&#x27; employer in the district is a sugar manufacturing company &quot;Dwangwa Sugar corporation&quot; (currently under Illovo). Most locals are smallholder farmers of rice, cassava and maize, while many others are small scale fishermen, who regularly fish along Lake Malawi&#x27;s shores, Chia Lagoon and many other rivers including Bua, Dwangwa, Dwambazi and Chilua, using triangular nets on poles, hooks, etc.

Another notable antiquity (tourist attraction) in Nkhotakota is the Mawira hot springs, an area of about 3km2 of hot water that continuously gushes from the ground since time immemorial. Mawira hot springs is situated at the central area of the district, some 5 km from the Ntchisi/Kasungu road junction. Sungu Island (made of sand and rocks) is another fascinating place to visit in Nkhotakota central. This island is situated inside the Lake Malawi, 1.5 km from its shore, and approximately 2 km from Kaliba station (dock), where passenger boats cruising along Lake Malawi picks up or drops off passengers and small scale traders.

<text>Mangochi is a township in the Southern Region of Malawi. Located near the southern end of Lake Malawi, in colonial times it used to be called Fort Johnston. As of 2018, it has a population of 53,498.

==History==
Mangochi was founded by colonial administrator Sir Harry Johnston in the 1890s as a British colonial defence post on the littoral plain of the Shire River&#x27;s western shore.

At , it was the largest ship to sail on Lake Malawi until being scrapped shortly after World War II. The gunboat, operated by the Protectorate of Nyasaland, is said to have fought the first naval battle of the First World War when it defeated the German vessel &quot;Hermann von Wissmann&quot; in August 1914.

Rioting in June 2003 injured three people. From March to November 2007, roughly 480 children were rescued from child labour on tobacco farms in Mangochi. In July 2008, elephants terrorised areas around Maldeco Fisheries in Mangochi and caused several deaths and damage to property, mainly crops. The Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Culture proposed moving the elephants into several game reserves, although the proposal stalled when some residents said they wanted the elephants to remain.

<text>Nsanje (formerly Port Herald) is the main city in Nsanje District within the Southern Region of Malawi.

The intense urbanization in the fertile Shire River valley has formed an extensive urbanized zone that runs from the city of Bangula, further north, passing through the city of Nsanje, in the center, and arriving in the city of Marka, in the south, even crossing the Mozambican border, covering the town of Vila Nova de Fronteira.

==Transport==
The city has a railway station on the Sena railway, under concession of Central East African Railways. The railway through Nsanje that connects Blantyre with Beira, Mozambique was severely disrupted by the Mozambique Civil War and remains closed. The main road north connecting the city to the rest of Malawi is being upgraded.

==Shipping==
A project is currently underway to dredge part of the Shire River in order to make sea transport to Malawi viable. The Shire merges with the Zambezi River, near Caia, Mozambique, and the Zambezi then flows into the Indian Ocean. As of September, 2010, some of the main concrete work on the jetty was complete and the port was officially declared open in a ceremony attended by President Bingu wa Mutharika of Malawi and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. However, by August 2016 the port was still incomplete and unused, despite a feasibility study with positive results concluded a few months earlier, and talks were being held on restarting the project.

==Notable people==
The deputy minister of health Halima Daud was born here.

==Climate==
Nsanje lies only about 46 meters above sea level. During the summer months, daytime highs can exceed 120 °F (49 °C).

<text>The Central Region is one of the five regions in the city-state of Singapore and the main metropolitan region surrounding the Central Area. Comprising of land area, it includes 11 planning areas within the Central Area, as well as another 11 more outside it. The region is home to many of Singapore&#x27;s national monuments as it was historically the site where the city was first founded and the country&#x27;s only UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Singapore Botanic Gardens, a -year-old tropical garden is also located in the region.

Although the Central Area is by nature chiefly commercial, especially the area in the Downtown Core, it also includes 335,400 residential housing units of various types, ranging from HDB flats to more exclusive forms of private housing, such as bungalows. There are also of green spaces, including parks, gardens and other recreational spaces linked by 19 km of park connectors, which were built in order to make this area aesthetically pleasing.

==History==
===Planning strategies===
Planning considerations for the URA Master Plan 2003 involving the Central Region took into consideration its existing strengths. Besides being the core area for business and entertainment in the city, it contains districts steeped in history, various housing types, and numerous institutions for education and community life. Despite the highly built-up character, it still boasts a rich variety of parks, open spaces, and other recreational areas. It is also well connected to the rest of the city through extensive road and rail connections, plus an international gateway to the world via the Maritime ports.

The Urban Redevelopment Authority envisaged the introduction of more homes of various types to the area, particularly in the Downtown Core which has been overwhelmingly commercial for the past decades. Supporting institutions and transport networks were upgraded or introduced to cater to the rising resident population in the area.

In terms of business, the New Downtown@Marina Bay was developed into an extension of the existing central business district. To encourage greater land-use flexibility, new business zones and white zones were also introduced. Business and research activities were promoted at the new one-north and medical park within the grounds of the Singapore General Hospital at Outram Park.

For recreation, plans were made to further extend the park connectors to new and existing parks in the region. New sporting facilities were also introduced, such as the redevelopment of the Kallang Sports Hub. Building conservation will continue to be enforced, and nodes for nidge activities will be provided for the masses. Plans for spaces catering specifically for youth activities near Orchard Road are a case in point.

==Geography==
With a land area of , the Central Region is situated on the southern part of Singapore Island, constituting a total of 21 planning areas. It is the only region to border all the other regions and the Straits of Singapore to the south. The region is also home to the 3.2 kilometers long Singapore River, from its source at Kim Seng Bridge to where it empties into Marina Bay. The region also features Singapore&#x27;s natural tallest point - Bukit Timah Hill with a height of 163.63 metres (537 ft.) above ground level.

<doc id="642636" wikidata="Q5394823" url="?curid=642636" title="Roberto Rodríguez (baseball)">
<text>Roberto Muñoz Rodríguez (February 5, 1941 – September 24, 2012) was a Venezuelan professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, and Chicago Cubs. He played in the United States under the name of Roberto Rodriguez.

Born in Caracas, Rodríguez carried a varied repertoire that relied on intelligence over raw explosiveness. He had a variable-speed fastball (reaching 90 MPH), a slider, a tough curveball, and a circle change-up as his most effective offering.

Once considered one of the best prospects in the Kansas City Athletics minor league system, he also pitched for the San Diego Padres and Chicago Cubs organizations.

Rodríguez was signed by the Athletics as an amateur free agent in 1963, spending seven minor league seasons from 1964–1970. He posted a 42–28 record and a 3.15 earned run average in 124 pitching appearances before being promoted to the big team in May 1967. He returned to the minors in early June and was recalled two months later.

He went 1–1 with a 3.57 ERA and two saves in 15 games (five starts). On August 27, he earned his first and only major league victory against the Detroit Tigers, 2–1, allowing four hits to a powerful lineup that included Norm Cash, Bill Freehan, Al Kaline, Dick McAuliffe, Eddie Mathews and Jim Northrup.

After that, Rodríguez would remain in the organization after the team was renamed the Oakland Athletics in 1968. He returned to the majors in 1970, pitching for the Athletics, Padres and Cubs in the same season. He later played three Triple-A seasons with the Tacoma Cubs and the Wichita Aeros from 1971 through 1974.

In a three-season career, he compiled a 4–3 record with a 4.81 ERA and seven saves in 57 games. Over the course of his 11-year minor league career from 1964–1974, he went 61–43 with a 3.60 ERA in 904 games.

In addition, Rodríguez played in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League during 17 seasons (1961–62/1978–79). ″Pluto″, as his teammates nicknamed him, went 64–49 with a 3.04 ERA and 59 saves in 168 games (97 starts), to become the first pitcher in VPBL history to top both 50 wins and 50 saves. The mark was later matched by Luis Aponte (1973–74/1996–97) and Giovanni Carrara (1990–91/2009–10).

After retiring he worked as a pitching coach in his Venezuelan homeland. He also served as an instructor in the baseball academy operated by Carlos Guillén in Maracay. In 2011, he gained induction into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame.

Rodríguez died in Maracay in 2012, at the age of 71, after suffering a heart failure.

<doc id="642639" wikidata="Q1172329" url="?curid=642639" title="Dateline NBC">
<text>Dateline NBC (also known simply as Dateline) is a weekly American television news magazine reality legal show that is broadcast on NBC. It was previously the network&#x27;s flagship general interest news magazine, but now focuses mainly on true crime stories with only occasional editions that focus on other topics. The program airs Fridays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time (9:00 p.m. Eastern for special two-hour editions). Special weekend encore editions also air at 9 or 10:00 p.m. (two-hour editions at 7 and 8:00 p.m. depending on the night). One or two-hour feature-length editions sometimes air on any given scheduled evening, often to fill vacancies in the primetime schedule on the program&#x27;s respective nights due to program cancellations. In February 2021, the program aired its first ever docuseries, &quot;The Widower&quot;, a five-hour true crime saga about a man who married six women, four of whom died.

==History==
===Early===
&quot;Dateline&quot; is historically notable for its longevity on the network, compared to the fifteen newsmagazines (often cloning the formulas of &quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;60 Minutes&quot;) NBC tried from the mid-70s until its debut which each debuted and ended ignominiously, often in the same year, or even the month they premiered, and were barely promoted, much less needed, during NBC&#x27;s ratings domination entertainment-wise in the 1980s. It also served to smooth relations with original anchor Jane Pauley, who had been controversially pushed out from &quot;Today&quot; and seen her own primetime make-up vehicle, the light news-focused &quot;Real Life with Jane Pauley&quot;, poorly paired with a tabloid newsmagazine, &quot;Exposè&quot;.

The program debuted on March 31, 1992, initially airing only on Tuesdays, with Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips serving as its co-anchors. Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric joined the program when the previously separate newsmagazine &quot;Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric&quot; was converted into &quot;Dateline Wednesday&quot;. Gradually, the program expanded with the addition of a third night (on Friday) in 1994 and a fourth night (on Monday) in 1997, peaking at five nights a week with Sundays in mid-1999 and 2000. The number of nights that the program aired began to be reduced due to viewer exhaustion and the rise of equally economic and popular reality television programming. Editions first began to be removed in the spring of 2001, with the main Tuesday slot being eliminated in 2004.

&quot;Dateline&quot; was the first &quot;multi-night&quot; franchise that &quot;established brand power by &#x27;stripping&#x27; editions,&quot; a strategy by NBC&#x27;s entertainment division to place the program in the same time slot every week. It was considered to be a singular program rather than multiple weekly programs, and included many teasers and multiple installment interviews (NBC later tried a similar strategy of &quot;stripping&quot; with &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; in 2009). In its prime, from 1995 to 1999, &quot;Dateline&quot; provided significant breaking news coverage. The program featured sensationalized news stories and drew in viewers with stories aired in multiple installments. By 1999, any one individual &quot;Dateline&quot; edition placed in Nielsen&#x27;s top 10 most-watched television programs among total viewers during most weeks. NBC capitalized on its relationship with CNBC and MSNBC by airing repackaged stories seen on past &quot;Dateline&quot; broadcasts on the retrospective series &quot;Headliners and Legends&quot; and &quot;Time and Again&quot;.

The program first originated from NBC Studio 3K, using the same set that was used at the time for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. When &quot;Today&quot; moved to its current facility, NBC Studio 1A, in 1994, &quot;Dateline&quot; took over Studio 3B and received its own brand-new dedicated set.

Past contributing anchors were Bryant Gumbel, who left NBC in 1997, Maria Shriver, who left NBC in 2004, and Katie Couric, who left NBC in 2006. On June 24, 2005, Ann Curry co-anchored &quot;Dateline&quot; for the first time and became permanent host shortly thereafter.

&quot;Dateline&quot; began broadcasting in high definition for the first time on July 21, 2008, with an episode titled &quot;Tower Dogs&quot;. &quot;Dateline&quot; previously shared the multi-level Studio 1A with &quot;Today&quot;. However, in 2013, the program moved back to Studio 3K, where the early-morning news programs &quot;Early Today&quot; and MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe First Look&quot; are also broadcast. Lester Holt replaced Ann Curry as host of &quot;Dateline&quot; with the start of the 20th season on September 23, 2011, shortly after Curry became permanent co-host of &quot;Today&quot;.

===General Motors vs. NBC===

On November 17, 1992, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; aired an hour-long investigative report titled &quot;Waiting to Explode,&quot; which focused on allegations that General Motors&#x27; &quot;Rounded-Line&quot; Chevrolet C/K-Series pickup trucks exploded upon impact when involved in collisions due to the poor design of the vehicle model&#x27;s fuel tanks. &quot;Dateline&quot;″s footage showed a sample of a low-speed accident in which the fuel tank exploded; the explosion during the crash test would later be discovered to have been staged by an expert witness for hire against GM, Bruce Enz of The Institute for Safety Analysis. Enz used incendiary devices and a poorly fitted gas cap to create the impression of a dangerous vehicle. The program did not disclose the fact that the accident was staged.

GM hired investigators from Failure Analysis Associates (FaAA, now Exponent) to study the footage; FaAA investigators discovered while reviewing the video that smoke had actually started to expel from the fuel tank six frames before the actual impact occurred. Acting on a tip from someone involved with the &quot;Dateline&quot; crash test, investigators with FaAA searched through 22 junkyards in Indiana before finding the charred wreckage of the GM pickups.

It was also later revealed that the &quot;Dateline&quot; report had been dishonest about the fuel tanks rupturing and the alleged speed at which the collision was conducted. The actual speed was found to be higher than stated, around , and after x-ray examination of the fuel tanks from the C/K pickups used in the televised collision, it was found that they had not ruptured and were intact. GM subsequently filed an anti-defamation/libel lawsuit against NBC after conducting an extensive investigation. On February 8, 1993, after announcing the lawsuit, GM conducted a highly publicized point-by-point rebuttal in the Product Exhibit Hall of the General Motors Building in Detroit that lasted nearly two hours.

The General Motors lawsuit and the subsequent settlement were arguably the most devastating blows for NBC in a series of reputation damaging incidents during the 1990s and early 2000s. Within NBC, Michael Gartner, who resigned under pressure shortly after the incident, was the source for much of the blame. NBC News President Reuven Frank stated Gartner was hired in 1988, despite having no background in television news, in an attempt to satisfy parent company General Electric, by replacing current journalists with cheaper, less experienced reporters and producers.

In addition to the resignation of the news division&#x27;s president Gartner, three &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; producers were dismissed as a result of the incident and the findings of the resulting investigation: executive producer Jeff Diamond, senior producer David Rummel, and Robert Read, producer of the report on the pickups. Michele Gillen, the correspondent involved in the segment, was transferred to NBC&#x27;s Miami owned-and-operated station WTVJ, where she became an anchor of the station&#x27;s evening newscasts.

===Michelle Madigan===
In August 2007, &quot;Dateline&quot; reporter Michelle Madigan attempted to secretly record hackers admitting to crimes at that year&#x27;s DEF CON in Las Vegas, Nevada. After being outed by DEF CON founder Jeff Moss during an assembly, she was heckled and chased out of the conference by attendees for her use of covert audio and video recording equipment. DEF CON staff tried to get Madigan to obtain a press pass before the outing happened. A DEF CON source at NBC News had tipped off organizers to Madigan&#x27;s plans.

==Special series==

===&quot;To Catch a Predator&quot;===

&quot;To Catch a Predator&quot; was a special series of reports, hosted by Chris Hansen, featuring hidden camera sting operations that bust potential sex offenders who carry out online chats with children with the intent of luring them to meet in person and engage in illegal sexual activity. The stings are conducted in partnership with Perverted-Justice, and begin for each potential offender with recordings of online chats of him with a &quot;decoy&quot; employed with the organization, posing as minor, generally between the ages of 12 and 15. If the potential offender and the decoy make an appointment, this is at the pretended home of the pretended minor, which is in fact a house prepared for the television show, with police hiding outside for the subsequent arrest of the offender outside the house.

During the filming of each episode, men who attempt to meet the minor in person are filmed as they enter inside the &quot;sting&quot; house. Shortly after the target is inside, often after talking to the Perverted-Justice decoy (who either briefly meets with the men or converses with them from another room), Hansen would confront each suspect and ask them about their online conversations (which were transcribed and printed) with the decoy. After the confrontation, the men are taken into custody by local police. Some men were arrested even if they never entered the home in question. The segment was cancelled in early 2008 in part due to criticism of the show as well as legal issues.

===“Wild Wild Web”===
“Wild Wild Web” was a limited Dateline series in which host Chris Hansen would go undercover to reply to illegal or unethical online advertisements. With hidden cameras rolling, Hansen and his producers met with a hitman, people selling body parts, and sweetheart swindles.

===&quot;To Catch a Con Man&quot;===
To Catch a Con Man was a series of hidden camera investigations devoted to the subject of identifying and detaining con men who attempted to extract money from victims in advance fee fraud scams, although some editions also focused on exposing and catching identity thieves. The stories, which were also reported by Chris Hansen (who called the identity thieves that the series investigates &quot;a different kind of predator&quot;), were conducted as an undercover sting operation in partnership with cardcops.com, a credit card watchdog group which investigates identity thefts and aims to catch the suspects in the act.

===&quot;The Real Blacklist&quot;===
Richard Engel hosted a tie-in version leading into &quot;The Blacklist&quot; about significant crimes and conspiracies.

===&quot;The Widower&quot;===
&quot;The Widower&quot; is Dateline&#x27;s first ever docuseries. &quot;The Widower&quot; takes viewers behind the scenes of a decade-long investigation into Thomas Randolph, an eccentric Las Vegas man accused of killing his wife Sharon. With hundreds of hours of exclusive footage, Dateline NBC veteran producer Dan Slepian captures the confounding murder investigation that soon reveals Sharon was Randolph&#x27;s sixth wife - and the fourth to die under mysterious circumstances.

===&quot;Dateline: The Last Day&quot;===
A spin-off series, &quot;Dateline: The Last Day&quot; premiered on June 14, 2022 on Peacock.

==Comparison with other news magazines==
&quot;Dateline&quot; focuses on true crime and human interest stories, predominantly featuring a single story for the entire program. Keith Morrison often serves as narrator for certain editions, usually reporting on real-life murder mysteries chronicled in many editions, and cliffhangers are used prior to commercial breaks. Famous con man Steve Comisar appeared regularly on &quot;Dateline&quot; as a fraud prevention expert.

The Friday night edition of &quot;Dateline&quot; features special emphasis on true crime stories, which previously included the &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot; series. Most NBC News specials, either in the form of special interviews or extended special reports on pertinent breaking news stories that occurred earlier in the day, are also broadcast under the &quot;Dateline&quot; banner. However, on occasion, the Sunday broadcasts (airing in a time slot otherwise reserved for family-friendly programming, aside from CBS&#x27; competitor &quot;60 Minutes&quot;) focuses on stories tailored for younger viewers, such as recent Sunday reports on teen drivers and child safety; on other weeks, the Sunday editions feature either true crime stories, stories recounting situations in which people have survived life-threatening situations, consumer reports or interviews.
&quot;Dateline&quot; features a single story format, although in the past the program maintained a traditional newsmagazine format with multiple segments of varying length, such as with the Sunday version, which in particular still occasionally features multiple story packages that are tied to a specific theme. Unlike the other flagship newsmagazines on U.S. television (CBS&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;), &quot;Dateline&quot; featured more character-driven stories focusing on the audience&#x27;s emotional attachment to the persons featured, and fewer non-character driven international and national news stories. However, the success of &quot;Dateline&quot; led to the other networks to create additional versions of their newsmagazines, &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; and additional nights of &quot;20/20&quot; (which were often not as successful).

Executive producer Neal Shapiro pioneered several &quot;signature segments&quot; that appeared regularly on the program. These included &quot;Dateline: Survivor&quot;, in which a person recounts a near-death experience and their eventual rescue; &quot;Dateline Timeline&quot;, in which a popular product, person and music single are shown/played that viewers are invited to guess what year it was from; &quot;State of the Art&quot;, explaining how a special effect or stunt in a movie was technically accomplished; &quot;Consumer Alert&quot;, in which common consumer complaints or issues (such as food safety and products of suspect quality that may be dangerous) are investigated, &quot;Dateline Hidden Camera Investigation&quot;, a story using hidden cameras to focus on an issue of public concern; and &quot;Newsmakers&quot;, light interviews with major figures in politics, entertainment, and business, as well as regular people in the news. The program also included cross-promotional segments with Court TV and magazines &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; and &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;. In the 1990s, a common week would feature several &quot;signature segments,&quot; breaking news, updates on past stories shown on the program, multi-part investigations, and interviews. &quot;Dateline&quot; also pioneered the use of viewer feedback including telephone polling and a unique format, the &quot;Interactive &quot;Dateline&quot; Mystery,&quot; where viewers voted (similar to &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;) on where the story should go next.

In 2019, taking advantage of the recent popularity of true crime podcasts such as &quot;Serial&quot;, and as part of a larger push into the medium by the division, NBC News launched a &quot;Dateline&quot; podcast; the podcast launched with the seven-episode story &quot;13 Alibis&quot;. &quot;Dateline&quot; producers stated that the podcast stories would be able to go more in-depth on topics than the television series, and did not rule out other types of content—including audio-only versions of stories from its archives, as well as extensions and updates to stories from the television series. In August 2022, when the podcast launched a premium subscription on Apple Podcasts, the &quot;Dateline&quot; podcast had 775 million downloads, and was ranked as the sixth-largest podcast in the U.S. by Podtrac.&quot;&quot;

==Syndication==
Repackaged hour-long true crime episodes of &quot;Dateline&quot; air on various cable and satellite channels such as Investigation Discovery, E!, USA Network (E! and USA are owned by NBC parent company NBCUniversal) and OWN, usually with the network names suffixing the generic branding of &quot;Dateline on...&quot;. Several other brandings exist, with &quot;Dateline: Secrets Uncovered&quot; as a part of Oxygen, &quot;Dateline: Real Life Mysteries&quot; on TLC (along with &quot;Dateline on TLC&quot;), and &quot;Dateline Extra&quot; the branding for repackaged episodes on MSNBC, also owned by NBCUniversal. All episodes are repackaged by NBC News under its non-fiction Peacock Productions banner. The NBCUniversal streaming service Peacock has featured a full-time streaming channel made up of &quot;Dateline&quot; episodes since its July 2020 launch. NBC News&#x27; free streaming channel NBC News NOW also airs episodes of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; every weekend.

On September 25, 2017, &quot;Dateline&quot; began airing archived true crime-focused episodes in daily broadcast syndication; the NBC branding is completely removed. These episodes also air as part of MyNetworkTV&#x27;s Wednesday and Thursday night lineups.

In February 2025, NBC News announced that it would begin to produce a Spanish-language version of the series for sister network Telemundo; it will be presented by &quot;Noticias Telemundo&quot; anchor Julio Vaqueiro.

===International broadcasts===
&quot;Dateline&quot; is broadcast in Canada, mainly through NBC and MyNetworkTV affiliates from U.S. border cities (such as KING-TV and KZJO in Seattle, WDIV-TV and WADL in Detroit, and WGRZ-TV and WNYO-TV in Buffalo, New York) that are widely available in that country; until the fall of 2022, new editions of the show were not simulcast on a Canadian network nationwide, though many of the same Canadian counterparts to the cable networks mentioned in the syndication section air the repackaged &quot;Dateline on...&quot; episodes as a part of their own schedules (especially those containing domestic stories), and some other American stations airing in Canada carry the &quot;Dateline&quot; syndicated package outside of network hours. Since the fall of 2022, Citytv simultaneously airs new episodes of &quot;Dateline&quot; with NBC in Canada (with domestic advertising), a rarity as Canadian networks do not generally simulcast American newsmagazines. Since January 2025, the syndicated version of &quot;Dateline&quot; also airs on the newly launched channel Oxygen Canada from Bell Media.

&quot;Dateline NBC&quot; is also seen on the 24-hour news network Orbit News in Europe and the Middle East, which broadcasts MSNBC and other NBC News programs for several hours a day. It is also broadcast on the Seven Network in Australia on Sundays at 5 a.m., although is pre-empted by paid programming on regional affiliates Prime Television and Golden West Network. In the Philippines, the program airs on TAP Edge.

<text>The Central Region of Malawi, population 7,523,340 (2018), covers an area of 35,592 km2. Its capital city is Lilongwe, which is also the national capital. The region has an outlet on Lake Malawi and borders neighbouring countries Zambia and Mozambique. The Chewa people make up the majority of the population today.

==Geography==
The Central region is bounded on the north by the Northern Region, on the east by Lake Malawi, on the southeast by Southern Region, on the southwest by Mozambique, and on east by Zambia.

Central Region straddles the western edge of the East African Rift. Lake Malawi occupies most of the rift valley, with a narrow plain running along its western shore. Much of the region lies on a plateau, known as the Central Region Plateau or Lilongwe Plain. The plateau covers 23,310 square km (9,000 square miles). A belt of hills and escarpments separates the plateau from the rift valley lowlands to the east. The Dwangwa, Bua, and Lilongwe rivers drain the plateau, emptying eastwards into Lake Malawi.

The southwestern boundary of the region is mountainous, including the northern end of the Kirk Range and Dedza Mountain (2,198 m).

== Administration ==
Of the 27 districts in Malawi, 9 are located within the Central Region. They are: Dedza, Dowa, Kasungu, Lilongwe, Mchinji, Nkhotakota, Ntcheu, Ntchisi, and Salima.

== Population ==
===Ethnic groups===
At the time of the 2018 Census of Malawi, the distribution of the population of the Central Region by ethnic group was as follows:
* 71.5% Chewa
* 14.6% Ngoni
* 4.9% Yao
* 3.2% Tumbuka
* 3.1% Lomwe
* 0.9% Tonga
* 0.5% Sena
* 0.4% Sukwa
* 0.4% Mang&#x27;anja
* 0.2% Nyanja
* 0.1% Nkhonde
* 0.1% Lambya
* 0.2% Others

<text>A dateline is a brief piece of text included in news articles that describes where and when the story was written or filed, though the date is often omitted. In the case of articles reprinted from wire services, the distributing organization is also included (though the originating one is not). Datelines are traditionally placed on the first line of the text of the article, before the first sentence.

==Format==
The location appears first, usually starting with the city in which the reporter has written or dispatched the report. City names are usually printed in uppercase, though this can vary from one publication to another. The political division and/or nation the city is in may follow, but they may be dropped if the city name is widely recognizable due to its size or political importance (a national capital, for instance). The date of the report comes after, followed by an em dash surrounded by spaces, and then the article.

A typical newspaper dateline might read:
:codice_1

The same story, if pulled from the United Press International wire, might appear with the UPI identifier as:
:codice_2

Datelines can take on some unusual forms. When reporters collaborate on a story, two different locations might be listed. UPI and the Associated Press omit a dateline &quot;when a story has been assembled from sources in widely separate areas.&quot; In other cases, the exact location may be unknown or intentionally imprecise, such as when profiling a riverboat plying its route, when covering military operations while on a ship at sea or following an invasion force, or when covering a press conference aboard an airplane.

==International variations==
Datelines are used globally with some variations depending on the country&#x27;s journalistic standards and practices. 

In the United Kingdom, datelines often include the city and sometimes the county for less well-known locations. A typical dateline in a British newspaper might read:
:codice_3

In Australia, datelines generally include the city and the abbreviation for the state or territory. An example dateline from an Australian news article might read:
:codice_4

In Japan, datelines often include the city and sometimes the prefecture. A Japanese newspaper dateline might look like:
:codice_5

In many European countries, such as France and Germany, datelines typically include the city name, often in uppercase, and the date. For example:
:codice_6
:codice_7

==Other media==
The concept of a dateline has been adapted to television. Reporters on news programs might have their location mentioned in an introduction from the news anchor:
:codice_8 
A field reporter might also end his stories by combining the location from where he filed the report with a &quot;lockout&quot; (the last thing a reporter says in the report, and includes his name and station ID, in addition to a news branding such as &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;); especially if the segment is recorded and not live. For example, the last bit of a report could sound like:
:codice_9

A number of current affairs TV shows have &quot;dateline&quot; as part of their name.

<doc id="642652" wikidata="Q868784" url="?curid=642652" title="Southern Region, Malawi">
<text>The Southern Region of Malawi is an area of Malawi. It covers an area of 31,753 km2. Its capital city is Blantyre. In 2018, its population was 7,750,629.

== Geography ==
Domestically, the Southern Region borders the Central Region and Lake Malawi to the north. Internationally, it borders the country of Mozambique to the east, west, and south. 

Of the 28 districts in Malawi, 13 are located within the Southern Region: Balaka, Blantyre, Chikwawa, Chiradzulu, Machinga, Mangochi, Mulanje, Mwanza, Neno, Nsanje, Phalombe, Thyolo, and Zomba.

The region is home to several parks: Majete Wildlife Reserve, Lengwe National Park, and Liwonde National Park (the last of these on the Shire River). It is also home to the Zomba Plateau as well as Mount Mulanje (the highest point in the country).

During July, the region sometimes experiences a damp fog, locally known as &quot;chiperoni.&quot;

==Demographics==

The Southern Region is home to about half of all Malawians. Of these, about 90% of them live in rural areas.

As of 2003, the Southern Region has a slightly higher rate of poverty (68.1%) than the Central Region (62.8%) and the Northern Region (62.5%). This is due to migration into the region, as well as the region&#x27;s relatively small cropland are per capita.

=== Ethnic groups ===
At the time of the 2018 Census of Malawi, the distribution of the population of the Southern Region by ethnic group was as follows:
* 39.3% Lomwe
* 24.9% Yao
* 8.3% Ngoni
* 8.2% Sena
* 6.8% Mang&#x27;anja
* 6.6% Chewa
* 3.8% Nyanja
* 0.9% Tumbuka
* 0.4% Tonga
* 0.1% Nkhonde
* 0.0% Lambya
* 0.0% Sukwa
* 0.7% Others

== Society ==
=== Economy ===
Cattle are quite important to the Southern Region as well as to Malawi as a whole. As of 1969, they made up about one third of the country&#x27;s national slaughter, and the region had a population of about 78,998 cows.

=== Healthcare and disease ===
Kwashiorkor exists in the Southern Region at a prevalence of about 1.8% as of 1995. It is most common among babies aged between 1 and 1.5 years old, and often co-occurs with dysentery. Lymphatic filariasis and antigenaemia are also quite common, especially in the east.

Violence against nurses is quite common in the region, with about 70% of nurses reporting workplace violence as of 2016. Most abuse occurs in the form of verbal abuse and threatening behavior, with physical assault and sexual assault being less common. Patients make up the largest segment of perpetrators.

<doc id="642659" wikidata="Q5646139" url="?curid=642659" title="Hampton, Ontario">
<text>Hampton is a community located in the municipality of Clarington, Ontario, Canada. It was the location of the offices of Darlington Township until 1974 when it became part of the newly created Town of Newcastle (now Clarington) as part of the municipal government restructuring that created the Regional Municipality of Durham.

 Hampton was founded by Henry Elliot in 1840, who opened the first mill here in the former Darlington Township. At first it was called Elliot&#x27;s Mill and by 1848 just Millsville. Other former names have included Hog&#x27;s Hollow and Shantytown. 
The Elliott home backed onto the pond and is one of the most historic properties in the Billings. With the opening of the post office the name Hampton was chosen, as it was an abbreviation of Henry Elliot&#x27;s birthplace, Kirkhampton in Cornwall, England.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Hampton had a population of 775 living in 272 of its 276 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 755. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Hampton Post office history==

The first post office in Hampton was opened in 1851. At that time, the name of the village was Millsville, but the name was changed with the opening of the post office. Henry Elliott served as its first Postmaster. His son, Henry Jr., took over the position until 1915, when Mr. W. Horn was appointed. During this period, the post office was located on the east side of town at Horn&#x27;s store (later destroyed by fire in 1983). In 1937, the post office was moved to Barron&#x27;s store across the street.

Finally, in 1971 the post office was moved to the federal building at its present location on Millville Ave, with Pete Barron as Postmaster. For many years, Marguerite (Chic) Richardson was the Assistant Postmaster. Mrs. Nancy Pella became Postmistress in 1982. Mrs. Pella retired in 2011. Mrs. Heather Garvock is the current Postmaster. Today, it services the village with lock boxes and two rural routes. One of these rural routes came into being with the closure of the Enniskillen post office in 1986.

<text>In the field of archaeology a deposit model is a method of identifying the character and degree of survival of buried archaeological remains over a specified area without necessarily excavating the whole area.

Following the introduction of archaeology into the planning process in most western nations, the importance of gathering as much information as possible on a site without digging it up has grown. Such information can be used to inform the decisions made by planners, developers and archaeologists about the necessity for, and nature of, any archaeological work in advance of new building.

A deposit model uses the results of previous excavations and other intrusive archaeological investigations to estimate the nature of the archaeology over a wider area. Productive excavations in one area would suggest that land nearby would also be productive. Since the buried archaeological record is essentially a volume of earth trapped between the two archaeological horizons defined by the underlying natural geology and the horizon of modern intrusions projecting down into the record, the detailed mapping of the underlying geology of an area has become important in deposit modeling and has resulted in a growth of work for geoarchaeologists. The results of surveying can be extrapolated between known geographical points and used to estimate the impact of certain types of development.

By taking into account known disturbances to the ground certain areas can be presumed to have limited archaeological potential. A survey of buildings identifying which have basements in them for example may suggest that certain streets have had all their archaeology removed (or truncated) in the past.

Where buildings stand on top of probable or known archaeology the effect that their foundations and floors have on ground water levels may also be important in the degree of preservation that can be expected.

All this information can be stored on a computer GIS database and analysed and augmented as time goes by and further information is revealed.

An early deposit model of the city of York was produced in the early 1990s and has been used to inform archaeological decisions in the city since.

<text>Yorvit Adolfo Torrealba (; born July 19, 1978) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants, Seattle Mariners, Colorado Rockies, San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, Toronto Blue Jays and Milwaukee Brewers. He bats and throws right-handed.

==Professional career==

===San Francisco Giants===
Torrealba signed with the San Francisco Giants as a minor league free agent on September 14, 1994. He made his major league debut with the Giants on September 5, 2001, as a September call up. His first major league hit was a triple. No other MLB player would record a triple for his first MLB hit until Jason Perry in 2008. Torrealba became the Giants back up catcher for the 2002 season after a strong spring training. During Torrealba&#x27;s early career, his defensive abilities were his key strength, particularly his ability to throw out baserunners. He had 136 at-bats in 2001 and 200 in 2002. During the 2002 postseason, Torrealba would still serve as the backup catcher although he made no appearances as the Giants lost the 2002 World Series to the Anaheim Angels.

Yorvit showed some potential, but when Benito Santiago left via free agency in 2003, the Giants opted to trade for A. J. Pierzynski rather than test Torrealba as a full-time player. He continued to serve as the backup catcher when the Giants signed Mike Matheny prior to the 2005 season; in fact, he played less than when Pierzynski was the starter. Torrealba expressed frustration over his lack of playing time to the media more than once, saying he believed he was capable of playing every day. Manager Felipe Alou publicly discussed the possibility of converting Torrealba into a utility player to get him more playing time, but that never came to pass.

===Seattle Mariners===
Torrealba was traded, along with pitcher Jesse Foppert, to the Seattle Mariners for outfielder Randy Winn at the trading deadline of the 2005 season. The Mariners were in the midst of a 93-loss season and were rebuilding, and Torrealba competed for the opportunity to be Seattle&#x27;s starting catcher.

===Colorado Rockies===
After the 2005 season, the Seattle Mariners traded Torrealba to the Colorado Rockies for Marcos Carvajal after signing Kenji Johjima to be their starting catcher. With the Rockies, Torrealba had a chance to be the starting catcher, but lost the job after he was injured prior to the 2006 season, establishing Danny Ardoin as the Rockies starting catcher. Torrealba&#x27;s injury was a lingering shoulder injury that was caused by overtraining.
During November 2007, rumors that Torrealba would sign with the Mets intensified. Torrealba and the Mets agreed on a deal for $14.4 million over three years. The deal had seemed to be done, but with the failing of Yorvit&#x27;s physical he was never sent to New York. Torrealba would later file a grievance against the Mets. On November 29, 2007, he re-signed with the Rockies.

Torrealba began the 2007 season for the Rockies platooning with rookie catcher Chris Iannetta. When Iannetta struggled, Torrealba won the starting job. On May 29, 2007, against the St. Louis Cardinals, Torrealba hit a grand slam, the 3rd of his career. He finished the season with a .255 average and 47 RBIs in 396 at-bats and he threw out only 17 percent of potential base-stealers, down from his success in previous seasons. Torrealba had some big hits for the Rockies during late 2007, when the Rockies won 12 of their last 13 to force a one-game playoff against the San Diego Padres, which the Rockies won. Torrealba homered off Jake Peavy in that game. Torrealba also hit a 3-run home run off of former teammate Liván Hernández in Game 3 of the 2007 National League Championship Series. Torrealba led the Rockies to the World Series for the first time ever but lost the series to the Boston Red Sox in a 4-game sweep.

Through the 2007 season, Torrealba posted a career .251 batting average with 30 home runs and 173 RBIs in 440 games. As a catcher, he compiled a .997 fielding average with only seventeen errors in 2587 chances; Torrealba&#x27;s defense has been above average throughout his career. He has thrown out over 32% of all baserunners attempting to steal. His ability to throw out runners was a career low 19.7% in 2007. Due to his impressive postseason play, Torrealba has recently been dubbed &quot;Mr. Rocktober.&quot;

Torrealba has an unusual throwing motion, as he brings his hand to and then snaps his arm in a quick motion, although it seems to work for him, given his success at throwing out baserunners.

On November 6, 2009, the Rockies decided to go with youngster Chris Iannetta as their primary catcher and declined their 2010 contract option with Torrealba, making him a free agent.

===San Diego Padres===
On February 9, 2010, Torrealba and the San Diego Padres signed a one-year contract with a mutual option for a second year. In 2010, he batted .271, and led the league&#x27;s catchers in fielding percentage, at .996. Following the season, Torrealba declined the option, but was later offered arbitration by the Padres.

===Texas Rangers===

Torrealba agreed to a two-year contract with the Texas Rangers for $6.25 million. Torrealba homered in his second game with his new team.

In 2011, he batted .273 with 7 home runs. On defense, he was third in the league in errors by a catcher, totalling 9 errors. Torrealba led the Rangers into the postseason until the team lost the 2011 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals.

On July 30, 2012, Torrealba was designated for assignment by the Texas Rangers He was released on August 8, 2012.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On August 14, 2012, Torrealba signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, and reported to the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. Torrealba was added to the 40 man roster and called up to the Blue Jays on August 21. On August 22, Torrealba played first base for the first time in his career.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
On September 21, 2012, Torrealba was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for cash considerations or a player to be named later. He ended up appearing in five games for the Brewers, going 0-for-5 at the plate with one walk.

===Colorado Rockies (second stint)===
On January 24, 2013, Torrealba signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies. He had his contract selected to the major league roster on March 29. In 61 games, Torrealba batted .240 and had 8 doubles and 16 RBIs for the Rockies.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===
On January 31, 2014, Torrealba signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He was released on March 23.

===Chicago Cubs===
On June 12, 2014, Torrealba signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs. He was released on July 17.

==Personal life==
Torrealba&#x27;s parents gave him his name when they could not decide between Yorman and Victor. They decided to combine the two into &quot;Yorvit&quot;. Torrealba&#x27;s parents still reside in Venezuela.

Torrealba has two sons named Yorvis Eduardo Torrealba (1997) and Julian Xavier Houston-Torrealba (2000). In June 2009, Yorvit Torrealba was unexpectedly placed on the Rockies&#x27; restricted list. On June 4, 2009, it was announced that the reason for his absence was that his 11-year-old son and &quot;his two uncles&quot; had been kidnapped. The abductors set Yorvis and the other family members free without picking up the $50,000 that had been agreed upon. He then moved his son out of Venezuela to Miami. Yorvis Eduardo tossed the first pitch in the third game of the 2009 National League Division Series against the Phillies, and he was drafted by the Rockies in the 20th round of the 2019 MLB draft.

==Controversy==
On December 23, 2011, while playing for the Leones del Caracas in the Venezuelan Winter League regular season, Torrealba argued heatedly following a strikeout. He then was ejected by umpire Dario Rivero, Jr. Before leaving, he delivered a shot to Rivero in the head. Torrealba claimed that his attack on the umpire was because of a disputed strike call prior to striking out. As a result, the league suspended Torrealba for 66 games, which did not carry over to Major League Baseball or any other baseball circuit.

<doc id="642667" wikidata="Q3357746" url="?curid=642667" title="Ottawa West—Nepean (federal electoral district)">
<text>Ottawa West—Nepean () is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1997.

==Geography==
The district includes the neighbourhoods of Ambleside, Bayshore, Bel-Air Park, Bel-Air Heights, Borden Farm, Braemar Park, Briargreen, Britannia, Carleton Heights, the western half of Carlington, Centrepointe, City View, Copeland Park, Crestview, Crystal Beach, Fisher Glen, Fisher Heights, Glabar Park, Kenson Park, Leslie Park, Lincoln Heights, Navaho, Parkwood Hills, Qualicum-Graham Park, Queensway Terrace North, Queensway Terrace South, Foster Farm, Redwood, Rocky Point, Ryan Farm, Shirleys Bay, Skyline, Whitehaven, Woodpark, and Woodroffe. All these neighbourhoods are located in the City of Ottawa, with many of them having been part of the former City of Nepean.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1996 from Ottawa West, Nepean and part of Lanark—Carleton ridings.
===2012 Federal Redistribution===
The 2012 federal redistribution saw the riding gain a small portion from Ottawa Centre, but it remained largely unchanged.
===2022 Federal Redistribution===
The 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution resulted in several boundary changes to the riding.

The eastern riding boundary along Merivale Road was pushed further east to Fisher Avenue. As a consequence, the entire Carlington neighbourhood (not just the western portion) is now part of the riding.

The north-east boundary has also been shifted east, from Maitland Avenue and Sherbourne Road to Golden Avenue and then along Carling Avenue to the 417 Highway. Consequently the McKellar Park and McKellar Heights neighbourhoods have been reassigned from the Ottawa Centre riding into Ottawa West—Nepean.

A small corner of the riding between Merivale Avenue on the West and the Rideau River on the east, and from the railroad tracks in the north to West Hunt Club Road in the south, has been moved from Ottawa West-Nepean to Nepean. While largely retail-commercial in nature, it includes a number of residential homes along or near Prince of Wales Dr.

The north-west boundary has been moved east from Herzberg Road to Davidson Side Road north of Carling Avenue. That portion has been moved into the Kanata (formerly the Kanata-Carleton) riding. It is a rural area which includes a large area of Federal lands, and so is of small consequence to elector counts.

== Demographics ==
&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

Ethnic groups: 60.7% White, 8.9% Black, 7.0% South Asian, 5.3% Arab, 4.6% Chinese, 4.1% Indigenous, 2.2% Southeast Asian, 2.0% Filipino, 1.4% Latin American, 1.4% West Asian

Languages: 60.3% English, 6.5% French, 4.2% Arabic, 2.0% Mandarin, 1.7% Italian, 1.4% Spanish, 1.2% Somali, 1.2% Cantonese, 1.1% Vietnamese, 1.0% Tagalog

Religions: 49.3% Christian (26.3% Catholic, 4.0% Anglican, 3.7% United Church, 2.3% Christian Orthodox, 1.3% Pentecostal, 1.0% Presbyterian, 10.7% Other), 10.8% Muslim, 3.3% Hindu, 1.8% Jewish, 1.5% Buddhist, 31.5% None

Median income: $42,800 (2020)

Average income: $55,900 (2020)

==Members of Parliament==

This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:




In the 2004 federal election, Marlene Catterall defeated Conservative Party candidate Sean Casey in a very close election.

In the 2006 federal election, Catterall stepped aside, and high-profile Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament, John Baird, contested and won the riding for the Conservative Party.

Until February 3, 2015, he was a member of the cabinet of Prime Minister Stephen Harper as Minister of Foreign Affairs. He has also previously served as President of the Treasury Board, then Minister of the Environment, then as Government House Leader. Baird resigned from the House of Commons on March 16, 2015.

<text>Birchwood Forest Park covers the area formerly occupied by the Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Risley, in Birchwood, Warrington, in north-west England. The park covers an area of and stretches from the M6 in the west to the M62, junction 11, in the east.

In 1985, a sculpture entitled Bo Peep and Her Sheep, sculpted by Diane Gorvin was introduced to the park. 

During World War 2, It was used as a bunker for bombs and soldiers. It was a good idea because of the daily fog that covered the area and the dense trees that surrounded it. It was also a good spot because there is an open field next to the woods, perfect for enemy’s to fall right into an ambush.

The park also contains a small cafe, forest and friends, and a large children’s park. :)

<doc id="642681" wikidata="Q3529015" url="?curid=642681" title="Timmins—James Bay (federal electoral district)">
<text>Timmins—James Bay () is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1997. Its population in 2011 was 83,104. Under the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution the riding will be renamed Kapuskasing—Timmins—Mushkegowuk.

The district includes the extreme eastern part of the District of Kenora, all of the District of Cochrane except for the central western part, and a small part south of Timmins, and all of the District of Timiskaming except for the extreme southeastern part.

Timmins—James Bay is the 11th largest riding in Canada and second largest in Ontario after Kenora.

==Geography==
Timmins—James Bay consists of
* the part of the Territorial District of Kenora lying east of a line drawn from the northeast corner of the most northerly point of the Territorial District of Thunder Bay (Albany River) due north to Hudson Bay;
* the Territorial District of Cochrane, excluding the part bounded by a line drawn from the western limit of the territorial district east along the northern limits of the townships of Boyce, Boyce, Shuel, Mulloy, Fintry, Auden, Rogers, Fushimi, Bannerman, Ritchie, Mulvey, Goldwin, Sweet, Hillmer, McKnight, Boyle, Mowbray, Howells, Sheldon, Pinard and Mewhinney, south along the eastern boundaries of the townships of Mewhinney, Bourassa, Tolmie, Menapia, Beniah, Colquhoun and Calder, west along the northern boundary of the Township of Ottaway, south along the western boundaries of the townships of Ottaway, Beck, Lucas and Prosser, and west along the southern boundaries of the townships of Carnegie, Reid, Thorburn, Moberly, Aitken, Poulett, Watson and Lisgar, to the southwestern limit of the territorial district;
* the part of the Territorial District of Timiskaming bounded by a line drawn from the northeast corner of the Township of Harris, west along the northern boundaries of the townships of Harris, Dymond, Hudson, Lundy, Auld and Speight, and south along the western boundaries of the townships of Speight, Van Nostrand and Leo to the southern limit of the territorial district.

==History==
Timmins—James Bay was created in 1996 from parts of Cochrane—Superior and Timiskaming—Cochrane ridings.

It consisted initially of:
* the part of the Territorial District of Cochrane lying west and north of a line drawn from the southeast corner of the City of Timmins north and west along the east and north limits of the city north along the east boundaries of the Townships of Prosser, Lucas, Beck and Ottaway, west and north along the south and west boundary of the Township of Clute, north along the east boundary of the Township of Colquhoun, and east along the south boundaries of the Townships of Marven, Thorning, Potter, Sangster, Bragg, Newman, Tomlinson, Hurtubise and St. Laurent,
* the part of the Territorial District of Kenora lying east of a line drawn north from the most northerly northeast corner of the Territorial District of Thunder Bay to Hudson Bay.

In 2003, it was given its current boundaries as described above.

This riding gained a fraction of territory from Nipissing—Timiskaming during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<text>Pieris ( or ) is a genus of seven species of shrubs in the flowering plant family Ericaceae, native to mountain regions of eastern and southern Asia, eastern North America and Cuba. Known commonly in North America as andromedas or fetterbushes, they are broad-leaved evergreen shrubs growing to tall and wide. The leaves are spirally arranged, often appearing to be in whorls at the end of each shoot with bare stretches of shoot below; they are lanceolate-ovate, long and broad, leathery textured, and with an entire or serrated margin. The young leaves in spring are typically brightly coloured. The flowers, which may have a very appealing honey scent, are bell-shaped, long, white or pink, and arranged in racemes long. The fruit is a woody capsule which splits into five sections to release the numerous small seeds.

&quot;Pieris&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the engrailed.

The genus name derives from &quot;Pieria&quot;, a place in Greece, according to Greek mythology the home of the Muses.

==Species==
*&quot;Pieris cubensis&quot; Western Cuba.
*&quot;Pieris floribunda&quot; – mountain andromeda, mountain pieris, mountain fetterbush. Eastern United States.
*&quot;Pieris formosa&quot; – Chinese pieris, Himalayan pieris. The Himalaya, southwestern China (Yunnan), northern Myanmar.
*&quot;Pieris japonica&quot; – Japanese andromeda. Eastern China, Japan, Taiwan.
*&quot;Pieris nana&quot; (syn. &quot;Arcterica nana&quot;). Japan, eastern Siberia.
*&quot;Pieris phillyreifolia&quot; – climbing fetterbush. Southeastern United States.
*&quot;Pieris swinhoei&quot; – southeastern China (Fujian, Guangdong).

==Cultivation==
They are commonly grown as ornamental plants, valued for year-round interest due to bright red new growth in early spring, chains of small, white flowers in mid-spring, and buds that remain on the plant through the winter. Numerous cultivars have been selected for different spring foliage colour. They grow best in a shady spot, sheltered from drying, winter winds. They prefer acidic soil, and should be mulched once per year, using a two-inch covering of either peat or composted pine needles. The flowers give the plant one of its alternative names, &#x27;Lily of the valley shrub&#x27; (though &quot;Pieris&quot; is not closely related to &quot;Convallaria&quot;).

==Cultivars==
The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:- 

* &#x27;Blush&#x27;
* &#x27;Cavatine&#x27;
* &#x27;Debutante&#x27;
* &#x27;Firecrest&#x27;
* &#x27;Flaming silver&#x27;
* &#x27;Forest flame&#x27;
* &#x27;Mountain fire&#x27;

<doc id="642683" wikidata="Q1427635" url="?curid=642683" title="Kalmia">
<text>Kalmia is a genus of about ten species of evergreen shrubs from 0.2–5 m tall, in the family Ericaceae (heath). They are native to North America (mainly in the eastern half of the continent) and Cuba. They grow in acidic soils, with different species in wet acid bog habitats (&quot;K. angustifolia, K. polifolia&quot;) and dry, sandy soils (&quot;K. ericoides, K. latifolia&quot;).

&quot;Kalmia&quot; was named by Linnaeus to honour his friend the botanist Pehr Kalm, who collected it in eastern North America during the mid-18th century. Earlier, Mark Catesby saw it during his travels in Carolina, and after his return to England in 1726, imported seeds. He described it, a costly rarity, in his &quot;Natural History of Carolina&quot;, as &quot;Chamaedaphne foliis tini&quot;, that is to say &quot;with leaves like the Laurustinus&quot;; the botanist and plant-collector Peter Collinson, who had begged some of the shrub from his correspondent John Custis in Virginia, wrote, when his plants flowered, that &quot;I Really Think it exceeds the Laurus Tinus.&quot;
The leaves are 2–12 cm long and simple lanceolate. The flowers are white, pink or purple, in corymbs of 10–50, reminiscent of Rhododendron flowers but flatter, with a star-like calyx of five conjoined petals; each flower is 1–3 cm diameter. The fruit is a five-lobed capsule, which splits to release the numerous small seeds.

The foliage contains grayanotoxins, a group of closely related neurotoxins named after &quot;Leucothoe grayana&quot;, native to Japan, so it is toxic if eaten, with sheep being particularly prone to poisoning, hence the name lambkill used for some of the species. Other names for Kalmia, particularly &quot;Kalmia angustifolia,&quot; are sheep-laurel, lamb-kill, calf-kill, kill-kid, and sheep-poison, which may be written with or without the hyphen. (See species list below.) &quot;Kid&quot; here refers to a young goat, not a human child, but the foliage and twigs are toxic to humans as well.

It has also been called [[spoonwood]] because Kalm was told by Dutch settlers of North America that Native Americans made spoons from the wood. Given its toxicity, this may be folklore rather than scientific fact.

Kalmias are popular garden shrubs, grown for their decorative flowers. They should not be planted where they are accessible to livestock due to the toxicity.

&quot;Kalmia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidopteran species including &quot;Coleophora kalmiella&quot; which feeds exclusively on &quot;Kalmia&quot;.

==Species==
Species and subspecies listed by Plants of the World Online:
* &quot;Kalmia angustifolia&quot; - Sheep-laurel, lambkill 
** &quot;Kalmia angustifolia&quot; subsp. &quot;carolina&quot; - Carolina mountain-laurel 
* &quot;Kalmia buxifolia&quot; - Sandmyrtle
* &quot;Kalmia cuneata&quot; - Whitewicky 
* &quot;Kalmia ericoides&quot; - Cuban kalmia
* &quot;Kalmia hirsuta&quot; - Hairy mountain-laurel 
* &quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot; - Mountain laurel
* &quot;Kalmia microphylla&quot; - Alpine laurel, alpine bog-laurel, alpine mountain-laurel 
** &quot;Kalmia microphylla&quot; subsp. &quot;occidentalis&quot; 
* &quot;Kalmia polifolia&quot; - Bog kalmia, bog-laurel 
* &quot;Kalmia procumbens&quot; 

&quot;Kalmia procumbens&quot; was treated as the only species in the genus &quot;Loiseleuria&quot; in older floras. The related &quot;Kalmiopsis leachiana&quot; and &quot;K. fragrans&quot; are rare shrubs endemic to southwest Oregon.

==Fossil record==
Fossil leaves of †Kalmia saxonica have been described from the Lower Miocene of Brandis, Germany and Bełchatów, Poland, †&#x27;Kalmia marcodurensis have been described from the Lower Miocene of Bitterfeld, Germany. In the Late Tertiary &quot;Kalmia&quot; was associated with coal-forming vegetation occurring as a component of the vegetation of bush swamps together with &quot;Cyrilla&quot; and other shrubs. Among recent species &quot;Kalmia angustifolia&quot; is most similar to †&quot;Kalmia saxonica&quot; in respect of morphology, while &quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot; has a very similar epidermal structure. These two extant species grow in the eastern part of North America from (Quebec to Florida) on acid swampy or marshy soils.

<text>Oxydendrum arboreum, the sourwood or sorrel tree, is the sole species in the genus Oxydendrum, in the family Ericaceae. It is native to eastern North America, from southern Pennsylvania south to northwest Florida and west to southern Illinois; it is most common in the lower chain of the Appalachian Mountains. The tree is frequently seen as a component of oak-heath forests.

==Growth==
Sourwood is a small tree or large shrub, growing to tall with a trunk up to diameter. Occasionally on extremely productive sites, this species can reach heights in excess of 30 meters and 60 cm diameter. The leaves are alternately arranged, deciduous, long and broad, with a finely serrated margin; they are dark green in summer, but turn vivid red in fall. The flowers are white, bell-shaped, 6–9 mm ( 1/4 to 1/3 inch) long, produced on long panicles. The fruit is a small woody capsule. The roots are shallow, and the tree grows best when there is little root competition; it also requires acidic soils for successful growth. The leaves can be chewed (but should not be swallowed) to help alleviate a dry-feeling mouth.

==Description==

The bark is gray with a reddish tinge, deeply furrowed and scaly. Branchlets at first are light yellow green, but later turn reddish brown. The wood is reddish brown, with paler sapwood; it is heavy, hard, and close-grained, and will take a high polish. Its specific gravity is 0.7458, with a density of 46.48 lb/cu ft.

The winter buds are axillary, minute, dark red, and partly immersed in the bark. Inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins.

Leaves are alternate, four to seven inches long, 1.5 to 2.5 inches wide, oblong to oblanceolate, wedge-shaped at the base, serrate, and acute or acuminate. Leaf veins are feather-veined, the midrib is conspicuous. They emerge from the bud revolute, bronze green and shining, and smooth; when full-grown, they are dark green, shining above, and pale and glaucous below. In autumn, they turn bright scarlet. Petioles are long and slender, with stipules wanting. They are heavily laden with acid.

In June and July, cream-white flowers are borne in terminal panicles of secund racemes seven to eight inches long; rachis and short pedicels are downy. The calyx is five-parted and persistent; lobes are valvate in bud. The corolla is ovoid-cylindric, narrowed at the throat, cream-white, and five-toothed. The 10 stamens are inserted on the corolla; filaments are wider than the anthers; anthers are two-celled. The pistil is ovary superior, ovoid, and five-celled; the style is columnar; the stigma is simple; the disk is ten-toothed, and ovules are many.

The fruit is a capsule, downy, five-valved, five-angled, and tipped by the persistent style; the pedicels are curving.

==Cultivation and uses==
The sourwood is hardy in the north and a worthy ornamental tree in lawns and parks. Its late bloom makes it desirable, and its autumnal coloring is particularly beautiful and brilliant. The leaves are heavily charged with acid, and to some extent have the poise of those of the peach. The leaves are also a laxative.

Sourwood is renowned for the honey that bees produce from the nectar of its flowers. Juice from its blooms is used to make sourwood jelly. The shoots were used by the Cherokee and the Catawba to make arrowshafts.

==In Appalachian culture==
Sourwood Mountain is a popular old-time tune in the Appalachian region of the United States.

<text>Adam Clark Curry (born September 3, 1964) is an American podcaster, announcer, Internet entrepreneur and media personality, known for his stint as a VJ on MTV and being one of the first celebrities to personally create and administer Web sites. Also known for co-hosting the &quot;No Agenda&quot; show, in the 2000s, he first became involved in podcasting, and has been called the &#x27;Podfather&#x27; because of his efforts.

==Early broadcast career==
Curry was born in Arlington, Virginia, but lived in Amstelveen, Netherlands, from 1972 to 1987. After a time working in Dutch pirate radio at Radio Picasso in Amstelveen and in Amsterdam in the early 1980s under the pseudonym &quot;John Holden&quot;, he got a break in broadcasting as the host of the Dutch weekly pop-music television program &quot;Countdown&quot;, and the English version of the same show, which was broadcast on pan-European music channel Music Box. He also hosted several other radio and television programs for the Dutch broadcast station Veronica. Aside from Countdown, in the Netherlands Adam Curry is mostly known for his part in the Curry and Van Inkel radioshow (together with Dutch DJ Jeroen van Inkel), broadcast on Radio 3 for Veronica between 19:00 and 22:00 on Friday.

In 1987, Curry became a VJ for MTV. Besides making spot appearances between music videos, he was also host of the programs &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and &quot;MTV Top 20 Video Countdown&quot; in which he interviewed stars like Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. While working for MTV, he also did radio work, including drive-time
host for the New York City radio station WHTZ, and host of the national program &quot;HitLine USA&quot;.

Curry hosted the radio countdown show &quot;Adam Curry&#x27;s Top 30 Hitlist&quot; for Entertainment Radio Networks from November 1991 to June 1994.

==Web and MTV.com==
Curry registered the then-unclaimed domain name &quot;mtv.com&quot; in 1993 with the idea of being MTV&#x27;s unofficial new voice on the Internet. Although this move was sanctioned by his superiors at MTV Networks at the time, when Curry left to start his own web-portal design and hosting company, OnRamp Inc, MTV subsequently sued him for the domain name.

OnRamp eventually grew to 4,000 employees and was sold to Think New Ideas Inc., another company that he co-founded, becoming chief technology officer of Think. In 1996, as the Internet was undergoing its &quot;bubble&quot;, the company made an initial public offering on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol THNK. It subsequently grew to employ over 7,400 people, with offices in seven countries, and was absorbed into Answerthink Inc. in a later merger.

In 2005, Curry founded a video-sharing site called PodShow, which later changed its name to Mevio, with Ron Bloom. In May 2008, Mevio claimed to have reached 9 million unique visitors. It offers advertisers &quot;brand-safe&quot; content on a large scale. It raised a US$15 million third round in July 2008, bringing the total amount it has raised since its launch to over US$38 million. Mevio later rebranded as Bitesize Entertainment and ultimately BiteSizeTV, located in Los Angeles, California.

==Enterprises in the U.S. and Europe==
After selling his business in the United States, Curry and his family moved to the Netherlands in 1999, where Curry hosted a morning talk/music show for Radio Veronica. He also landed various television assignments and his family briefly starred in the reality show &quot;Adam&#x27;s Family&quot;.

Curry and two business partners founded the multimedia company United Resources of Jamby in 1999. It was to act as an incubator and cultivator for new Internet-related businesses. The business was ultimately unsuccessful. Curry&#x27;s participation in &quot;Kennisnet&quot;, another venture to introduce the Internet to Dutch schools, ended in a bitter argument and lawsuits.
Sportus.nl, an online webshop in collaboration with Dutch athletes like Marcel Wouda, Jacco Eltingh, Ron Zwerver and Daniëlle Overgaag, started in 1999, went bankrupt in 2001.
Another content exchange project, Freedom Controller, was cancelled in 2002.

In 2000 he and business partner Simon Cavendish, a participant in his earlier ventures, founded the RotorJet company to offer helicopter services. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2005. In the subsequent dispute, Cavendish seized the assets of the company, and in April 2005, Curry was ordered by a Dutch court to repay approximately US$3 million that he had withdrawn from RotorJet.

In 2002 he produced and starred in the reality soap &quot;Adam&#x27;s Family: een kijkje in het leven van de familie Curry (A Glimpse into the Life of the Curry Family)&quot; which was aired by the Dutch SBS6 network.

On June 14, 2010, Curry was interviewed by Howard Stern on The Howard Stern Show about being an Internet Entrepreneur. During the interview, Curry discussed a previous investment of $65,000 in AskJeeves.com, which he had forgotten until his lawyer called with news of a windfall. “That went public and all of a sudden I had $150 million,” he explained.

==Podcasting==
Curry founded PodShow, now Mevio, with his business partner Ron Bloom, in January 2005. PodShow is a podcast promotions and advertising company that encompasses the Podshow Podcast Network, the Podcast Delivery Network, and the Podsafe Music Network. Some of Podshow&#x27;s top podcasts are Curry&#x27;s own &quot;Daily Source Code&quot;, &quot;The Dawn and Drew Show&quot;, and &quot;GeekBrief.TV&quot;.

From June 2005 to May 2007, Curry hosted a weekday evening show on Sirius Satellite Radio called &quot;Adam Curry&#x27;s PodShow&quot;.

Since October 2007, he has hosted the twice-weekly podcast the &quot;No Agenda&quot; Show with John C. Dvorak, discussing recent news whilst deconstructing mainstream news media.

Curry has promoted his podcasting endeavors. He promoted his podcast &quot;Daily Source Code&quot; in Second Life under the name &#x27;Adam Neumann&#x27;, along with a Second Life island called Podshow Island. Curry used podcasting to endorse 2008 Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul. He also uses his show to discuss alternative takes on topics in the daily news, as well as conspiracy theories such as Free energy suppression and the 9/11 Truth Movement.

Curry has sometimes been credited for popularizing the podcast medium. Annalee Newitz said in &quot;Wired&quot; that &quot;Every new medium needs a celebrity, and Curry is happy to fill that role.&quot;

On March 4, 2020, Curry appeared on Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast The Joe Rogan Experience and later re-appeared on September 8, 2020. During the September show, he discussed having Tourette syndrome. Curry returned to the podcast for a third time on July 6, 2021. Adam Curry made a fourth appearance on the show on January 8, 2022, and a fifth on January 25, 2023.

=== Podcast Index ===

Adam Curry started a podcasting directory called &quot;Podcast Index&quot; in 2020. The platform is an open-source database of podcasts that, as of 2024, has over four million entries in its database. The service&#x27;s software is licensed under the open MIT License and the entire database is downloadable in SQLite format. Podcast Index collects Web feeds of podcasts that developers can then use in their projects and applications, for example, the podcast player &quot;podchaser&quot;.

==Creative Commons licensing==
In February 2006, Curry sued the Dutch tabloid &quot;Weekend&quot; for reprinting photos from his Flickr page and publishing details about his daughter. The photos were released under a version of the Creative Commons license that forbids commercial use and requires acknowledgement, but the tabloid printed a few of them without contacting Curry. The verdict did not award Curry any damages, but forbade the tabloid from reprinting the photos in the future, setting a fine of €1,000 for each subsequent violation. It was one of the first times the license was tested in court.

In May 2009, Curry posted on his blog that another Dutch tabloid had published another Creative Commons-licensed photo from Curry&#x27;s Flickr account. After Curry asserted Creative Commons license requirements, the publisher settled on Curry&#x27;s terms.

==Personal life==
Since 1999, Curry has, at one time or another, lived in Belgium; Guildford and London, England; San Francisco and Los Angeles, California, and Austin, Texas, U.S.

He is fluent in both English and Dutch.

Curry was married to Dutch television/radio personality Patricia Paay from 1989 to 2009. They have a daughter, Christina.

In July 2012, Curry married Micky Hoogendijk. On January 29, 2015, Curry announced on the &quot;No Agenda&quot; show that he and Hoogendijk had separated. Hoogendijk and Curry divorced in 2015.

Curry married his girlfriend of four years, Tina Snider (dubbed &quot;The Keeper&quot; by John C. Dvorak on the &quot;No Agenda Show&quot;), on May 19, 2019, in Austin, Texas.

Curry is the nephew of former CIA official and United States Ambassador to Korea Donald Gregg, whom he calls &quot;Uncle Don&quot; in his podcast.

==Born-again Christian==
Together with his wife Tina Snider he found God at age 58. In an interview on Dutch television that was shown right before an episode of the Hour of Power in January 2025, Curry says that he and his wife simultaneously felt the need to find a church and start reading the Bible. After watching the episode of The Chosen in which Jesus explains to Nicodemus how to be born (again) of water and the Spirit, Curry says he was ready to be baptized. He considers it an honorary title when people are calling him a Jesus-freak. Curry tells openly about this process and the changes in his life in interviews and podcasts.

<text>Culcheth Linear Park is a park in the district of Culcheth, Warrington, England.

Like the Black Bear Park and sections of the Trans Pennine Trail, Culcheth Linear Park is built on former railway tracks. This park lies on a section of the former Wigan Junction Railways.

The line was first opened to goods in 1878 and was later connected to , , , and . At the outbreak of World War II lines were connected to the Royal Naval Aircraft Training Establishment at Culcheth (HMS &quot;Ariel&quot;) and the Royal Ordnance Factory at Risley. Following the Beeching Report of 1964, the line was closed.

On 21 December 1970, part of the former rail route was conveyed to Golborne Urban District Council (Golborne UDC). In 1974, Golborne UDC was split between two newly created local authorities: the Borough of Warrington and the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan. The portion of the rail route that was acquired by Warrington was converted into a new park.

Today it is home to many local community projects and a variety of wildlife. There are also some limited facilities for sport.

In February 2023, it garnered worldwide attention as the park was the location of the murder of teenager Brianna Ghey.

<text>Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd is a 1993 American family comedy film. Directed by Rod Daniel and written by Len Blum, it is the sequel to the 1992 film &quot;Beethoven&quot;, second installment in the &quot;Beethoven&quot; film series and the last to be released theatrically. Charles Grodin, Bonnie Hunt, Nicholle Tom, Christopher Castile and Sarah Rose Karr reprised their roles with Debi Mazar and Chris Penn joining the cast. Initially, no sequel was planned, but it was produced after the unexpected financial success of the previous film.

==Plot==

In the Newton family home, George, Alice, Ryce, Ted, Emily and Beethoven are all well-adjusted to living together. One day, Beethoven sneaks out and meets a female St. Bernard, Missy, and her owner, Brillo. Brillo&#x27;s estranged wife Regina arrives with her new boyfriend Floyd, takes Missy away, and threatens to keep her unless Brillo agrees to a divorce with a $50,000 alimony settlement.

Beethoven helps Missy to escape from Regina and Floyd&#x27;s condominium, and the two dogs fall in love. Meanwhile, Ryce develops strong romantic feelings for her classmate, Taylor Devereaux, after he kisses her. Some months later, Ted and Emily become aware of Beethoven constantly sneaking out of the house and follow him. They discover he is bringing food to Missy, who has had four puppies in the basement of Regina and Floyd&#x27;s condominium building. The local janitor also finds the dogs, and informs Regina and Floyd. Regina then reclaims Missy and plans to kill or abandon the puppies, until the janitor talks her out of it, as purebred puppies are worth a lot of money. Regina decides to follow his advice and sell the pups to a pet store.

Having overheard Regina&#x27;s first plan to dispose of the puppies, Ted and Emily trick Regina, sneaking the puppies out of her building and into their own basement. Ryce helps her siblings to care for the pups and keep the secret from their father George, but he manages to discover the truth anyway. After an argument, he is reluctantly persuaded to keep the pups until they mature.

The Newtons are offered a free stay in a mountain lakefront house owned by one of George&#x27;s business associates. There, Taylor invites Ryce to a party with his friends, where she is exposed to teenage drinking and sexual harassment. Taylor locks her in his bedroom, but Beethoven destroys the house&#x27;s patio deck, saving a grateful Ryce from Taylor&#x27;s unwelcome advances.

While still on vacation, the Newtons go to a county fair with the dogs. Ryce, Ted, and Emily persuade George to enter a burger eating contest with Beethoven, which they easily win. Regina and Floyd, who coincidentally are hiding out from Brillo in the mountains and are also at the fair, spot the Newtons. Regina snatches the puppies&#x27; leashes from Ted and Emily, only to discover that Missy, who had been locked in Floyd&#x27;s car, has escaped with Beethoven&#x27;s help. Regina and Floyd chase the fleeing dogs into the woods, and are quickly hunted down by the Newtons. At a cliff&#x27;s edge, George confronts Floyd, who threatens to drop the puppies into the river below and pokes George in the stomach with a large stick. Beethoven charges into the stick and rams it into Floyd&#x27;s groin, causing him to lose his balance. Regina grabs Floyd&#x27;s hand and they both fall off the cliff, land in a pool of mud, and are swept away by the river. Beethoven, Missy, the puppies and the Newtons return home.

Five months later, Brillo visits the Newtons with Missy, revealing that the judge in the divorce has granted him full custody of her. The puppies, now grown, run downstairs to see Missy.

==Cast==
The film was Danny Masterson&#x27;s screen debut. His younger brother, Christopher, also had a small role, but when the producers noticed the resemblance, they removed him.

==Production==
The film is set in California, but the park scenes were filmed in Montana at Glacier National Park. The house used as the Newtons&#x27; home is located at 1405 Milan Avenue in South Pasadena.

Production required more than 100 smooth- and rough-coated St. Bernard puppies of various ages starting at seven weeks, who were then returned to the breeders. Missy was played by three adult short-haired dogs, and Beethoven was played by two long-haired ones, although only the dog who created the role in the first film is credited; a mechanical dog, a dog&#x27;s head for specific facial expressions, and a man in a dog suit were also used.

===Song===
The theme song, &quot;The Day I Fall in Love&quot;, performed by James Ingram and Dolly Parton and written by Ingram, Carole Bayer Sager and Clif Magness, was nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy Award.

==Reception==
The film grossed more than $118 million at the box office worldwide.

===Critical response===
Although the film was not well received by film critics, it received acclaim by audiences. Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it &quot;[amounted] to a live-action cartoon&quot; and was &quot;certainly a more pleasing tale&quot; than the first. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it two stars, calling it &quot;no masterpiece&quot; but praising Grodin&#x27;s work and noting that the dogs carried it. Kevin Thomas in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; rated it &quot;just as funny and appealing as &quot;Beethoven&quot; the first&quot; and also praised Mazar as Regina.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 23%, based on reviews from 13 critics, with an average rating of 4.55/10. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave it a grade &quot;A&quot;.

<text>Beethoven&#x27;s 4th is a 2001 American direct to video comedy film. It is the third sequel to the 1992 film &quot;Beethoven&quot; and the fourth installment in the &quot;Beethoven&quot; film series. It was released on December 4, 2001. It is the last film to feature Judge Reinhold as Richard Newton, Julia Sweeney as Beth Newton, Joe Pichler as Brennan Newton, and Michaela Gallo as Sara Newton.

== Plot ==
Richard Newton checks in with his two children, Sara and Brennan, before school. Richard and his family are still watching Beethoven while Richard&#x27;s brother George and his family are still out of town for business. The children love their St. Bernard dog, Beethoven, whom they are keeping for relatives, but their parents do not, and want to get rid of him. The children begin taking the dog to Obedience Training led by a former army sergeant. Brennan falls in love with a girl named Hayley, while Beethoven literally destroys the obstacle course in one day. To top it all off, Beethoven hits the army sergeant in the groin with a leash causing him to kneel over in pain.

Meanwhile, the rich Sedgewick family owns a pampered and well-behaved St. Bernard that looks exactly like Beethoven, named Michelangelo. Michelangelo and young Madison Sedgewick are friends, but her busy parents, Reginald and Martha, are always neglecting her. In fact, Reginald is the only one who seems to try to play with her. Beethoven, meanwhile, runs after a loose hot dog cart, and ends up on a merry-go-round. Michelangelo has gotten loose, as well, and is now on the same merry-go-round. Brennan and Sara mistake him for Beethoven and take him home. The real Beethoven is mistaken for Michelangelo, and grabbed by Jonathan Simmons, the Sedgewick family&#x27;s butler and taken to their mansion.

Sara is surprised when Michelangelo wipes his feet on the welcome mat and folds the napkins with his teeth at dinner. The Sedgewicks notice the change in &quot;their dog&quot; too, when he bolts Simmons to the ground to get a piece of turkey. That night, Beethoven hears Madison whimpering because of a bad dream, and comforts her. At the next obedience class, Michelangelo leaves everyone in astonishment, by finishing the entire new obstacle course, while the sergeant is announcing the course.

Meanwhile, Beethoven ruins a dinner party, when a man named Nigel tries to dognap him. A therapist points out to Martha that the reason &quot;Michelangelo&quot; is acting this way is because he is the first one exhibiting &quot;symptoms&quot;. The therapist suggests that it may be because Martha does not care about anyone but herself. Richard is concerned about &quot;Beethoven&quot;, and starts acting out to get &quot;Beethoven&quot; to misbehave again too. Richard drinks toilet water, chases the mailman, etc. Michelangelo ends up catching on, and starts behaving like Beethoven.

The Sedgewick family start playing fetch and swimming with Beethoven, but as the Sedgewicks and Beethoven are hiking, Nigel (who turns out to be Simmons&#x27; sidekick) kidnaps Beethoven and locks him in a warehouse, for a ransom of $250,000. Beethoven breaks out and secretly switches places with Michelangelo at the obedience graduation. The real Michelangelo is found by the Sedgewicks, and Simmons and Nigel are arrested by two FBI agents. The real Beethoven is found by the Newtons and he graduates. The Sedgewicks and Newtons then meet up at a fork on the road, though, they never find out about the switching of Beethoven and Michelangelo.

<text>Lymm Dam is the name of a dam and lake in Lymm, Cheshire, England, an inset village in the greenbelt around Warrington. It was created in 1824 by a dam built during the construction of what is now the A56 road, when local inhabitants objected to initial plans for a route through the village centre. It may have been used to supply power to local industry, and the surrounding area.

Warrington Borough Council began managing the Lymm Dam and its park in the early 1980s. At that time there were considerable erosion problems and the Ranger Service began to upgrade the existing path network and take over the park maintenance. It is now a popular visitor attraction, which has won several Green Flag Awards for its improvements to the infrastructure and ecology of the dam.

<doc id="642701" wikidata="Q1546735" url="?curid=642701" title="Vafþrúðnismál">
<text>Vafþrúðnismál (Old Norse: &quot;The Lay of Vafþrúðnir&quot;) is the third poem in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. It is a conversation in verse form conducted initially between the Æsir Odin and Frigg, and subsequently between Odin and the jötunn Vafþrúðnir, as they engage in a battle of wits. The poem goes into detail about the Norse cosmogony and was evidently used extensively as a source document by Snorri Sturluson in the construction of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; who quotes it. The poem is preserved in Codex Regius and partially in AM 748 I 4to. There are preservation problems relating to stanzas 40-41. &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; is believed to be a 10th century poem.

==Structure==
The poem consists of 55 stanzas in total, which are composed in a ljóðaháttr meter. Stanzas 1-4 are a conversation between Odin and Frigg, which set up the plotline and stanza 5 sends him off on his journey. Stanzas 6-55 are solely between Gagnráð (Odin) and Vafþrúðnir.

==Synopsis==

The lay commences with Odin asking advice and directions of Frigg as to whether it would be wise to seek out the hall of Vafþrúðnir to compete with the all-wise jötunn in a contest of knowledge. Frigg counsels against this course of action, saying that Vafþrúðnir is the most powerful one she knows. Nevertheless Odin continues with his quest.

On arriving at Vafþrúðnir&#x27;s hall, Odin seeks to test Vafþrúðnir&#x27;s wisdom through the classic mechanism of a wisdom contest. Vafþrúðnir&#x27;s response is to accept the wanderer in his hall and only allow him to leave alive if Odin proves to be wiser. Odin, a master of dissimulation, attempts to pass himself off as Gagnráðr (trans. &quot;victory&quot;), and beseeches the traditional hospitality which should be afforded to wayfarers. Vafþrúðnir, wrong-footed, invites him in and to seat himself. A game of riddling then ensues between the pair.

During the course of stanza 19, Vafþrúðnir was unwise enough to wager his head in the case of defeat: victory for Odin will result in his death. In stanza 55, at the conclusion of the contest, Vafþrúðnir is obliged to capitulate to Odin&#x27;s cunning when Odin asks him what Odin whispered in Baldr&#x27;s ear prior to Baldr&#x27;s body being placed on the funerary ship, a question to which only Odin knows the answer; it is a rule of the wisdom contest that questions could only be asked to which the questioner knew the answer and so it is at this point that Vafþrúðnir recognizes his guest for who he is:

:You alone know that, what long ago
:You said in the ears of your son.
:I doomed myself when I dared to tell
:What fate will befall the gods,
:And staked my wit against the wit of Odin,
:Ever the wisest of all.
::&quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; 55, translated by Auden and Taylor

<text>A tart is a baked dish consisting of a filling over a pastry base with an open top not covered with pastry. The pastry is usually shortcrust pastry; the filling may be sweet or savoury, though modern tarts are usually fruit-based, sometimes with custard. Tartlet refers to a miniature tart; an example would be egg tarts. The categories of &quot;tart&quot;, &quot;flan&quot;, and &quot;pie&quot; overlap, with no sharp distinctions.

== History ==

The French word &quot;tarte&quot; can be translated to mean either pie or tart, as both are mainly the same except a pie usually covers the filling in pastry, while flans and tarts leave it open. While many tarts are also , in the sense of sour in taste, this appears to be a coincidence; the etymologies of the two senses of the word are quite separate.

Tarts are thought to have either come from a tradition of layering food or to be a product of medieval pie making. Enriched dough (i.e. shortcrust) is thought to have been first commonly used in 1550, approximately 200 years after pies. In this period, they were viewed as high-cuisine, popular with nobility, in contrast to the view of a commoner&#x27;s pie. While originally savory, with meat fillings, culinary tastes led to sweet tarts prevailing, filling tarts instead with fruit and custard. Early medieval tarts generally had meat fillings, but later ones were often based on fruit and custard.

An early tart was the Italian &quot;crostata&quot;, dating to at least the mid-15th century. It has been described as a &quot;rustic free-form version of an open fruit tart&quot;.

== Description ==

Tarts are typically free-standing with firm pastry base consisting of dough, itself made of flour, thick filling, and perpendicular sides while pies may have softer pastry, looser filling, and sloped sides, necessitating service from the pie plate.

== Varieties ==
There are many types of tarts, with popular varieties including Treacle tart, meringue tart, tarte tatin and Bakewell tart. A &quot;jam tart&quot; uses jam in place of fresh fruit.

&quot;Tarte Tatin&quot; is an upside-down tart, of apples, other fruit, or onions.

Savoury tarts include quiche, a family of savoury tarts with a mostly custard filling; German Zwiebelkuchen and Alsace Tarte à l&#x27;oignon or Zewelwaï (onion tarts), and Swiss cheese tart made from Gruyère.

<text>Asa Griggs Candler Sr. (December 30, 1851 – March 12, 1929) was an American business tycoon and politician who in 1888 purchased the Coca-Cola recipe for $238.98 from chemist John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. Candler founded The Coca-Cola Company in 1892 and developed it as a major company.

Prominent among civic leaders of Atlanta, Candler was elected and served as the 41st mayor of the city, from 1916 to 1919. Candler Field, the site of the present-day Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, was named after him, as is Candler Park in Atlanta. As head of Coca-Cola, he built the Candler Building in Atlanta, as well as one in Kansas City (which became known as the Western Auto Building), a Candler Building in New York City, and one in what is now known as the Inner Harbor area of Baltimore, Maryland.

== Family ==
Asa Griggs Candler was born on December 30, 1851, in Villa Rica, Georgia. His parents were Martha and Samuel Charles Candler, a merchant and property owner. His parents raised eleven children, including Asa and his brother Warren Akin Candler. Samuel Charles Candler was a member of the legislature of South Carolina, and fought in the Creek War of 1836.

Candler&#x27;s children are:
* Asa&#x27;s oldest son, Charles Howard Candler (1878–1957), was chairman of the board of trustees of Emory University. His family estate was Callanwolde on Briarcliff Road in Druid Hills; it has been adapted for use as a fine arts center.
* The second son, Asa G. Candler Jr. (1880–1953), eccentric, alcoholic, and depressed, became a real-estate developer, opening the Briarcliff Hotel. His Briarcliff mansion and estate—also on Briarcliff Road in Druid Hills—was adapted for use as an alcoholism rehab center, then a psychiatric hospital. It is now owned by Emory University and used as its Briarcliff campus. Asa Jr.&#x27;s menagerie of animals enabled a major expansion of Zoo Atlanta in the 1930s. From 1930 to 1952, in front of the scenes or behind them, Asa was responsible for reshaping Westview Cemetery and building its massive Spanish Plateresque abbey.
* Only daughter Lucy (1882–1962) married Henry Heinz, a banker and Kiwanis president. He was shot by a burglar in their mansion, Rainbow Terrace, in 1943. Rumors persisted that a relative murdered him. The widowed Lucy Candler Heinz later married cellist and conductor Enrico Leide. He founded a forerunner of the present Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.
* Third son Walter T. Candler (1885–1967) was a businessman, philanthropist, and horse sportsman. His Lullwater House and estate has been adapted for use as the residence of the Emory University President. Another portion is a park, and other land is the site of a Veterans Administration complex in Druid Hills. Walter T. Candler had 2 sons and 3 daughters. 
* Youngest son William Candler (1890–1936), was the local financier of the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel and Biltmore Apartments. He was elected president of the Biltmore Corporation in February 1930, and was manager of the Biltmore Hotel. His mansion, named Rest Haven, is located on Springdale Road in Druid Hills.

== Biography ==
=== Founder of Coca-Cola ===
A druggist in 1888, Asa Griggs Candler met John Stith Pemberton and was intrigued by a sweet, carbonated drink he had developed. Candler bought the Coca-Cola recipe from Pemberton, for an amount rumored to be $2,300. The drink was derived from brewed coca leaves, as well as caffeine, carbonated water, and sugar. In 1892, he founded the Coca-Cola Company. The following year, he trademarked the brand and distributed the first dividends to the company&#x27;s shareholders.

By 1895, the company was distributing Coca-Cola nationwide in the United States. It first started exporting in 1899, to Cuba. Exports to Europe started two years later. He also developed the famous &quot;$1 contract&quot; where he sold the rights to bottle Coca-Cola in the US for only one dollar. At first, the company advertised Coca-Cola as a drink that relieved mental and physical fatigue, and cured headaches.

In 1903, Candler decided to remove the cocaine component from the coca leaves before mixing them with the drink, and to sell the extracted cocaine to pharmaceutical companies. In 1911, the company reached an annual advertising budget of $1 million. In 1915, the bottling company Root Glass Co. created the iconic Coca-Cola bottle.

In 1916, after Candler was elected mayor of Atlanta, he ended his day-to-day management of the Coca-Cola Company. In 1917, the Coca-Cola company agreed to reduce by 50% the amount of caffeine in the drink. In 1919 Candler gave most of the stock in The Coca-Cola Company to his children. They sold their shares to a consortium of investors led by Ernest Woodruff.

=== Atlanta builder and mayor ===
In 1906 Candler completed what was then Atlanta&#x27;s tallest building, the Candler Building. It had intricately carved decorations and was 17 stories tall. It still stands at Peachtree and Auburn streets and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, significant for its architectural detail and role as a company symbol. In 1912 the Candler Building in New York opened.

In 1916, Candler was elected mayor of Atlanta (taking office in 1917). As mayor he balanced the city budget and coordinated rebuilding efforts after the Great Atlanta fire of 1917 destroyed 1,500 homes. He also made large personal loans in order to develop the water and sewage facilities of the city of Atlanta, in order to provide the infrastructure necessary to a modern city.

Candler was also a philanthropist, endowing numerous schools and universities (he gave a total of $7 million to Emory University,) and the Candler Hospital in Savannah, Georgia. Candler had paid to relocate Emory University from Oxford, Georgia, to Atlanta.

=== Death ===
Asa Candler suffered a stroke in 1926 and never recovered. He died on March 12, 1929, at Wesley Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. He is buried at Westview Cemetery on the west side of Atlanta.

== Legacy ==
=== Atlanta ===
The Candler Field Museum in Williamson, Georgia, has been established to commemorate the original Candler Field, the first Atlanta airport.

Callan Castle, the Candler home in Inman Park, built from 1902 to 1904, still stands as a private home.

Candler&#x27;s later mansion, built in 1916 at 1500 Ponce de Leon Avenue, Druid Hills, was later adapted for use as the John Chrysostom Melkite Greek Catholic Church.

In 1922, he donated over of his Druid Hills holdings to the City of Atlanta for what became Candler Park. That year he also sold the Central Bank and Trust.

Several Candler buildings were constructed as the Coca-Cola Company expanded in the early 20th century: 
*Baltimore, Maryland - The Candler Building, located on the northeast corner of East Pratt Street and Market Place in eastern downtown, at the Inner Harbor, still bears his name. The brick industrial style building faces the waterfront of the basin of Baltimore Harbor, on the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River. Used as a regional headquarters for the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, the structure was known for having brass door knobs engraved with &quot;CC&quot; for the company. Between the late 1930s and 1960, the building served as the national headquarters of the new Social Security Administration. This agency was authorized under the Social Security Act of 1935, one of the New Deal programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. By the 2000s, as the old waterfront area and municipal piers area were being redeveloped from commercial and industrial uses, the Candler Building was renovated for offices and some apartments/condos.
*In Kansas City, the Western Auto Building was known as the Coca-Cola Building or Candler Building when constructed for the Coca-Cola Company in 1914, and during its occupancy. It has been converted to loft condominiums.
*In New York City, the Candler Building is still in use.

<doc id="642723" wikidata="Q1737075" url="?curid=642723" title="Gumball machine">
<text>A gumball machine is a type of bulk vending machine that dispenses individual gumballs in exchange for money. They were developed around the early twentieth century.

==History==
Although vending machines for stick or block-shaped gum were seen as early as 1888, the first machines to carry actual gumballs were not seen until 1907 (probably released first by the Thomas Adams Gum Co. in the United States). Patented in 1923, the Norris Manufacturing Company produced their &quot;Master&quot; line of chrome gumball machines during the 1930s. These machines could accept either pennies or nickels.

Founded in 1934, the Ford Gum and Machine Company of Akron, New York was another early manufacturer of gum for gumball machines in the U.S. The Ford brand of gumball machines had a distinct shiny chrome color; sales of gum from Ford gumball machines went to local service organizations such as the Lions Club and Kiwanis International.

Founded in 1909, Northwestern Corporation started with kitchen matches and eventually came out with the Northwestern Model 33 in 1933 (naming for the year which it came out) and eventually the Model 60 and Model 80, both of which are still sold today.

==Design and operation==

Generally, a gumball machine consists of a clear sphere (originally glass, now most often plastic) which is filled with gumballs, sitting on top of a metal base. It has a locked metal top which can be removed to restock the machine. A coin is inserted into the base and a knob is turned clockwise 360 degrees, depositing the coin in the base of the machine and allowing a gumball or trinket to be dispensed into a chute at the bottom of the machine that is closed off by a metal flap.

Most gumball machines have a simple mechanism for dispensing the gumball, to the point of the actual dispensation being largely invisible (after turning the handle the gumball is deposited behind the door). However, some gumball machines have more elaborate methods. Most of them utilize the potential energy of the gumball&#x27;s location above the base, by, for instance, causing it to roll down a spiral ramp, or a set of diagonal disks (each one is tilted in the opposite direction than the preceding one) with holes in lowest point. The most elaborate mechanisms also use electricity to power various forms of transit (e.g. lifts and pulleys) as well as ramps and drops for the gumball upon its way to dispensation.

<doc id="642727" wikidata="Q17033474" url="?curid=642727" title="Warrington Borough Council">
<text>Warrington Borough Council is the local authority of the Borough of Warrington, a local government district in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. Warrington has had a borough council since 1847, which has been reformed on several occasions. Since 1998 the council has been a unitary authority, being a district council which also performs the functions of a county council.

The council has been under Labour majority control since 2011. It meets at Warrington Town Hall and has its main offices at 1 Time Square.

==History==
The town of Warrington was made a municipal borough in 1847, governed by a body formally called the &quot;mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Warrington&quot;, generally known as the corporation, town council or borough council. This first incarnation of the borough council replaced an earlier body of improvement commissioners which had governed the town since 1813. From its creation in 1847 the borough straddled Lancashire and Cheshire, with the county boundary being the River Mersey; the town centre and most of the built-up area was on the north bank of the river in Lancashire, but the borough also included the built-up parts of Latchford on the south bank of the river in Cheshire.

In 1889 boroughs which straddled county boundaries were placed entirely in the county which had the majority of the population, and so the part of the borough south of the Mersey was transferred from Cheshire to Lancashire. The borough boundaries were subsequently enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1890, 1933 and 1954.

In 1900 Warrington was made a county borough, making it independent from Lancashire County Council, whilst remaining part of Lancashire for ceremonial purposes.

The borough was substantially enlarged in 1974, taking in a number of surrounding parishes from both Lancashire and Cheshire, including Lymm, which had been a separate urban district. The enlarged borough was transferred from Lancashire to Cheshire and was redesignated as a non-metropolitan district, with Cheshire County Council providing county-level services.

The borough council regained control of county-level functions 24 years later in 1998. The way this change was implemented was by creating a new non-metropolitan county called Warrington covering the borough, but with no separate county council. Instead, the existing borough council took on county council functions, making it a unitary authority. It remains part of Cheshire for ceremonial purposes.

==Governance==
As a unitary authority, Warrington Borough Council has the functions of a county council and district council combined. In its capacity as a district council it is a billing authority collecting Council Tax and business rates, it processes local planning applications, it is responsible for housing, waste collection and environmental health. In its capacity as a county council it is a local education authority, responsible for social services, libraries and waste disposal. Parts of the borough are also covered by civil parishes, which form a second tier of local government for their areas.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since 2011.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:

Non-metropolitan district
Unitary authority
===Leadership===
The role of Mayor of Warrington is largely ceremonial. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1985 have been:

The Mayors since 1998 have been:

The Mayor&#x27;s role is to perform civic duties across the Borough, such as attending large events in different communities and taking the lead on certain recognised days, such as Remembrance Sunday. The Mayor has no power over policies, as that is the job of the Leader. The Mayor also chairs Full Council meetings. Though elected as a Councillor representing a particular Party, the Mayor remains impartial when chairing but also has a vote of their own (often voting with their Party line).

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, plus a defection from the Labour administration in October 2024 the composition of the council was:
The next elections are due in May 2028.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2016 the council has comprised 58 councillors representing 22 wards, with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Premises==
The council generally meets at Warrington Town Hall on Sankey Street. The building was originally built in 1750 as a large house, and was formerly called Bank Hall. It was bought by the borough council in 1870 and converted into a town hall, with its grounds becoming a public park.

The council&#x27;s main offices are at 1 Time Square which was completed in 2020, replacing earlier offices at New Town House on Scotland Road which have since been demolished.

Elected members have approved a number of significant commercial investments by the local authority. In September 2016, Warrington Borough Council became one of the first local councils in the UK to buy clean-tech bonds in Swindon Solar Park through its owner, specialist investment management firm Rockfire Capital.

In September 2019, the council acquired a 50% shareholding in Clydebank-based energy retailer Together Energy for £18m. In September 2020, Bristol Energy&#x27;s brand and residential accounts – 155,000 meter points – were sold by Bristol City Council to Together Energy for £14 million. In August 2021, Warrington Council&#x27;s total financial exposure to Together Energy was reported to be £41.2m. In October 2021, Ofgem issued a provisional order to several suppliers, including Together Energy, who had not made Renewables Obligation payments; Together Energy&#x27;s obligation was over £12m. Following sharp increases in wholesale gas and electricity prices which began in autumn 2021, Together Energy Retail Ltd announced on 18 January 2022 that it was ceasing to trade.

Other loans and investments include almost £30 million paid in stages between 2017 and 2019 for a 33% stake in Redwood Bank, a &quot;challenger bank&quot; which has a Warrington office. In 2021 a £202m loan facility, secured against commercial property, was provided to Matt Moulding, founder of Cheshire-based e-commerce business The Hut Group.

In September 2021, the council confirmed that its borrowing had reached £1.7 billion, but that the current value of its investment assets were £2.173 billion.

In May 2024, just after the local election, it was announced by the Government that they had commissioned a &quot;Best Value&quot; inspection into the council&#x27;s finances. In June 2024 Moody&#x27;s Ratings withdrew its credit rating from the council after it failed to provide accounts signed-off by an auditor.

<doc id="642728" wikidata="Q903188" url="?curid=642728" title="Hydrogenolysis">
<text>Hydrogenolysis is a chemical reaction whereby a carbon–carbon or carbon–heteroatom single bond is cleaved or undergoes (breakdown) by hydrogen. The heteroatom may vary, but it usually is oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. A related reaction is hydrogenation, where hydrogen is added to the molecule, without cleaving bonds. Usually hydrogenolysis is conducted catalytically using hydrogen gas.

==History==
The term &quot;hydrogenolysis&quot; was coined by Carleton Ellis in reference to hydrogenolysis of carbon–carbon bonds. Earlier, Paul Sabatier had already observed the hydrogenolysis of benzyl alcohol to toluene, and as early as 1906, Padoa and Ponti had observed the hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol. Homer Burton Adkins and Ralph Connor were the first to call the carbon–oxygen bond cleavage &quot;hydrogenolysis&quot;.

==In the petrochemical industry==

In petroleum refineries, catalytic hydrogenolysis of feedstocks is conducted on a large scale to remove sulfur from feedstocks, releasing gaseous hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The hydrogen sulfide is subsequently recovered in an amine treater and finally converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit. In those industries, desulfurization process units are often referred to as hydrodesulfurizers (HDS) or hydrotreaters (HDT). Catalysts are based on molybdenum sulfide containing smaller amounts of cobalt or nickel. Hydrogenolysis is accompanied by hydrogenation.

Another hydrogenolysis reaction of commercial importance is the hydrogenolysis of esters into alcohols by catalysts such as copper chromite.

The hydrodeoxygenation reaction used in the Neste Renewable Diesel process, the vegetable oil refining process of largest production capacity, is a hydrogenolysis of triglycerides into alkanes.

==In the laboratory==
In the laboratory, hydrogenolysis is used in organic synthesis. Debenzylation is most common and involves the cleavage of benzyl ethers:

Thioketals undergo hydrogenolysis using Raney nickel in the Mozingo reduction.

Laboratory hydrogenolysis is operationally similar to hydrogenation, and may be accomplished at atmospheric pressure by stirring the reaction mixture under a slight positive pressure of hydrogen gas, having flushed the apparatus with more of this gas. The hydrogen may be provided by attaching a balloon to a needle, filling it from a bottle, and inserting the needle into the reaction flask via a rubber septum. At high pressure, a hydrogenation autoclave (i.e., a Buchi or Parr hydrogenator) or similar piece of equipment is required.

<doc id="642732" wikidata="Q2895269" url="?curid=642732" title="Fugitive Slave Act of 1793">
<text>The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was an Act of the United States Congress to give effect to the Fugitive Slave Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3), which was later superseded by the Thirteenth Amendment, and to also give effect to the Extradition Clause (Article 4, Section 2, Clause 2). The Constitution&#x27;s Fugitive Slave Clause guaranteed a right for a slaveholder to recover an escaped slave. The subsequent Act, &quot;An Act respecting fugitives from justice, and persons escaping from the service of their masters&quot;, created the legal mechanism by which that could be accomplished.

==Passage and later amendment==
The Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 4, 1793, by a vote of 48–7, with 14 abstaining. The &quot;Annals of Congress&quot; state that the law was approved on February 12, 1793.

The Act was written amidst a controversy about a free black man named John Davis who was kidnapped from Pennsylvania and brought to Virginia. However, the Act failed to resolve that controversy; the kidnappers from Virginia were never extradited to Pennsylvania, and John Davis remained a slave.

The Act was later strengthened at the insistence of the slave states of the American South by the Compromise of 1850, which required state governments and the residents of free states to enforce the capture and return of fugitive slaves. The enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 outraged Northern public opinion.

==Excerpts==
The full text of the Act is available from the Library of Congress (and online) in the &quot;Annals of Congress of the 2nd Congress, 2nd Session,&quot; during which the proceedings and debates took place from November 5, 1792, to March 2, 1793. The specific Act and the Congressional vote is on pages 1414–1415.

==Effects==

This law put fugitive slaves at risk of recapture for the rest of their lives, but some slave-owners did not think that it was strong enough. It also classified children born to fugitive slave mothers as slaves and the property of their mother&#x27;s master for the rest of their lives.

Ona Maria Judge, sometimes referred to by the diminutive &#x27;Oney&#x27; by her owners, was one of Martha Washington&#x27;s slaves and chambermaids. She served the Washingtons in Virginia and at the President&#x27;s House in Philadelphia when George Washington was President (the city was the temporary capital from 1790 to 1800). She escaped on May 21, 1796. Washington made two attempts to seize her shortly afterwards, even enlisting the help of the Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott Jr. in a letter written on September 1, 1796. Later, his nephew visited her and asked for her to return. Neither attempt was successful. Washington acted discreetly to avoid controversy in Philadelphia, which had a strong Quaker abolitionist community.

Having settled in New Hampshire, married and had a child, Oney Judge was interviewed by Rev. Benjamin Chase in the 1840s. He published the account in a &quot;letter to the editor&quot; in the abolitionist newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot; on January 1, 1847. He described how under the law, she and her child were still at risk for being seized as a fugitive slave at any time, even 50 years after her escape, if Martha Washington&#x27;s descendants decided to make a legal claim. Legally, they had inherited the pair as part of their mother&#x27;s estate:

Many northern states enacted legislation to protect free black Americans (who could otherwise be abducted, brought before court without the ability to produce a defense, and then lawfully enslaved) as well as runaway slaves. Those laws came to be known as personal liberty laws and required slave owners and fugitive hunters to produce evidence that their captures were truly fugitive slaves, &quot;just as southern states demanded the right to retrieve runaway slaves, northern states demanded the right to protect their free black residents from being kidnapped and sold into servitude in the south&quot; (Finkelman 399).

One controversy was the case of &quot;Prigg v. Pennsylvania&quot;. Edward Prigg, a citizen of Maryland, was indicted by a Pennsylvania court for attempting to kidnap a black woman in York County to return her to Maryland as a fugitive slave. He was tried and convicted by a local court in Pennsylvania, but the case was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Prigg had originally shown his legal warrant to the Pennsylvania court, but it had been unlawfully ignored, which demonstrated that the Fugitive Slave Act really depended on state judges, not federal law.

The slave-catching industry expanded as a result of the law, with men who were effectively bounty hunters capturing and returning many slaves to their owners.

In addition, the high demand for slaves in the Deep South and hunt for fugitives caused free blacks to be at risk of being kidnapped and sold into slavery, even if they had their &quot;free&quot; papers. There were numerous instances of people who were legally free and had never been slaves being captured and brought south to be sold into slavery. The historian Carol Wilson documented 300 such cases in &quot;Freedom at Risk&quot; (1994) and estimated there were likely thousands of others. A prominent example of this was Solomon Northup, born free around 1808 to Mintus Northup and his wife in Essex County, New York state. (In his memoir, Solomon did not name his mother but described her as of mixed race and a quadroon.) In 1841, Northup was tricked into going to Washington, DC, where slavery was legal. He was drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery, and he was held as a slave in Louisiana for 12 years. One of the very few to regain freedom under such circumstances, he later sued the slave traders involved in Washington, DC. Its law prohibited Northup from testifying against the white men because he was black and so he lost the case. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article on the trial on January 20, 1853. Northup published his memoir, &quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot; (1853), a slave narrative of plantation life on the Red River in Louisiana, and a description of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s slave trade. The memoir was adapted as a feature film by British director Steve McQueen in 2013, winning three Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The critics praised the screenplay and the performances, but there were conflicting views about the historical accuracy of the events, both in the film and in the book.

<text>All Hallows-by-the-Tower, at one time dedicated jointly to All Hallows (All Saints) and the Virgin Mary and sometimes known as All Hallows Barking, is an Early Medieval Anglican church on Byward Street in the City of London, England, overlooking the Tower of London.

According to the church website and other sources it is &quot;the oldest church in the City of London&quot; and was founded in AD 675, although recent research has questioned these claims. The church survived the Great Fire of London in 1666, but was badly damaged during the Blitz in World War II. Following extensive reconstruction, it was rededicated in 1957. From 1922 until 1962 the vicar was Tubby Clayton, and the church is still the guild church of Toc H, the international Christian organisation that he founded.

== History ==


The origin and early history of All Hallows-by-the-Tower church are obscure. At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 the church belonged to Barking Abbey, a Roman Catholic Benedictine nunnery in Barking, Essex, originally established in the 7th century. The association with Barking was a long one, and All Hallows church was already known as &quot;Berkyncherche&quot; in the 12th century. According to Domesday Book in 1086, Barking Abbey possessed &quot;28 houses and half a church&quot; in London: although the church is not named, it is usually identified with All Hallows.
The original Anglo-Saxon abbey of Barking was founded by Earconwald or Erkenwald, along with Chertsey Abbey, before he became Bishop of London in 675, and it has been claimed that the land on which All Hallows stands was granted to the abbey, under Abbess Æthelburh (Ethelburga), Erkenwald&#x27;s sister, at that time. A charter dated to 687, listing properties belonging to Barking Abbey, includes two pieces of land in or near London. One of these was simply described as &quot;&quot;iuxta Lundoniam&quot;, near/next to London, the other as &quot;supra vicum Lundoniae&quot;&quot;, that is, in &quot;Lundenwic&quot;, the Anglo-Saxon town that had grown up in the area of the Strand, a mile to the west of the old Roman city of Londinium; neither of these, though, accurately describes the location of All Hallows church, inside the wall of the Roman city on the eastern side.

In 1940, during World War II, the clearance after destruction caused by bombing revealed an archway built of reused Roman tiles and stonework, set in a surviving wall of the medieval church. The reuse of Roman building materials, and comparison with arches in the early Anglo-Saxon church at Brixworth, Northamptonshire, suggested that the All Hallows arch was very early in date, and that an original church could have been built as early as the 7th century. This seemed to confirm the belief that the church had been founded as a daughter church of Barking Abbey at about the same time as the abbey itself was established, although it is doubtful that the first construction on the site would have been in stone. It is more likely that the stone church, of which the arch is a remnant, superseded an earlier wooden building. Recent research, and archaeological evidence that Roman tiles and stone were being used in the construction of other London churches as late as the 11th century, suggest that the arch could have been constructed at any time between the 7th century and the arrival of the Normans. Fragments of three 11th-century stone crosses also found during archeological work in the 1930s and clearance works after the bombing, now displayed in the crypt, also date from this first church.

The church was expanded and rebuilt several times between the 11th and 15th centuries, with various elements of the Norman, 13th-century and 15th-century constructions still visible today. Its proximity to the Tower of London meant that it acquired royal connections, with Edward IV making one of its chapels a royal chantry and the beheaded victims of Tower executions being sent for temporary burial at All Hallows, Sir Thomas More being one of the most eminent of these.

The church was badly damaged by an explosion in 1650 caused when some barrels of gunpowder being stored in a warehouse adjacent to the church exploded; its west tower and some 50 nearby houses were destroyed, and there were many fatalities. The tower was rebuilt in 1658. It only narrowly survived the Great Fire of London in 1666 and owes its survival to Admiral William Penn, father of William Penn of Pennsylvania fame, who had his men from a nearby naval yard blow up the surrounding buildings to create firebreaks. During the Great Fire, Samuel Pepys climbed the church&#x27;s tower to watch the progress of the blaze and what he described as &quot;the saddest sight of desolation&quot;.

Restored once more in the late 19th century, All Hallows was gutted by German bombers during the Blitz in World War II and required extensive reconstruction, and was rededicated in 1957. The church now included carving by the Tasmanian born wood carver Ellen Nora Payne.

Many portions of the old church survived the War and have been sympathetically restored. Its outer walls are 15th-century, with the Anglo-Saxon arch doorway surviving from the original church. Many brasses remain in the interior. (The brass rubbing centre which used to be located at All Hallows is now closed). Three outstanding wooden statues of saints dating from the 15th and 16th centuries can also be found in the church, as too an exquisite Baptismal font cover which was carved in 1682 by Grinling Gibbons for £12, and which is regarded as one of the finest pieces of carving in London. The main-altar&#x27;s reredos mural is a post-war work by Brian Thomas.

In 1999 the AOC Archaeology Group excavated the cemetery and made many significant discoveries.

The church has a museum in its crypt, containing portions of a Roman pavement which together with many artefacts was discovered many feet below the church in 1926/27. The exhibits focus on the history of the church and the City of London, and include Anglo-Saxon and religious artefacts as well as the 17th-century church plate. Also on display are the church&#x27;s registers dating back to the 16th century, and notable entries include the baptism of William Penn, the marriage of John Quincy Adams, and the burial of Archbishop William Laud. Laud remained buried in a vault in the chapel for over 20 years; his body was moved during the Restoration to St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. The crypt also houses the church&#x27;s chapels dedicated to St Francis (14th century) and St Clare (early 17th century) as well as the columbarium, created in 1933.

The altar in the crypt is of plain stone from the castle of Richard I at Athlit in The Holy Land.

All Hallows-by-the-Tower has been the guild church of Toc H since 1922. The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

The church also has a chime which was brought back to working order in the 1970s by Philip Blewett, then a priest at the church, and Desmond Buckley over many weekends.

The Knollys Rose Ceremony, held annually in June, starts at the church and processes to the Mansion House, where a single rose is presented to the Lord Mayor as a &#x27;quit rent&#x27;. The parish&#x27;s annual beating the bounds ceremony also includes a boat trip to the middle of the Thames to &#x27;beat&#x27; the water that forms the southern boundary.

== Organ ==

The earliest records of an organ in All Hallows is one by Anthony Duddyngton dating from 1521. This was presumably lost during the English Civil War.

An organ was installed in 1675 by Thomas and Renatus Harris. In 1720 a new case was built by Gerard Smith. The organ was restored and improved by George Pike England in 1813, Bunting in 1872 and 1878, and Gray and Davison in 1902. There was further work by Harrison and Harrison in 1909 and 1928. After destruction in 1940, a new organ by Harrison and Harrison was installed in 1957.

<doc id="642738" wikidata="Q2933905" url="?curid=642738" title="Calgary Southwest">
<text>Calgary Southwest was a federal electoral district in Alberta, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 to 2015. The district was in the southwest part of the city of Calgary, south of Glenmore Trail and west of the Canadian Pacific Kansas City Railway line.

Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper represented the riding during his leadership.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1987 from parts of the Bow River, Calgary West, Calgary East, Calgary South, and a small piece of Calgary Centre ridings.

The riding was abolished during the Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012, 80% into Calgary Heritage and 20% into Calgary Midnapore.

===Historical boundaries===

===Members of Parliament===

This riding has elected the following members of the House of Commons of Canada:





===Members of Parliament===
All three of the riding&#x27;s MPs were prominent: Bobbie Sparrow served in the cabinet led by Kim Campbell, while Preston Manning was the leader of the Reform Party of Canada from 1987 and Leader of the Opposition from 1997 to 2000. Its final MP in the Southwest configuration was Prime Minister Stephen Harper, an economist and a lecturer outside politics. He was elected to Calgary Southwest, shortly after becoming leader of the Canadian Alliance and thus leader of the Opposition, in a 2002 by-election occasioned by Manning&#x27;s retirement. From 2003, Harper was the leader of the re-formed Conservative Party of Canada, and from 2006, prime minister; he ceased to be both after the 2015 Canadian federal election.

<text>&quot;Servant of the servants of God&quot; () is one of the titles of the Pope and is used at the beginning of papal bulls.

==History==
Pope Gregory I (pope from 590 to 604), the first Pope to use this title extensively to refer to himself, deployed it as a lesson in humility for the archbishop of Constantinople John the Faster (in office 582-595), who had been granted the traditional title &quot;Ecumenical Patriarch&quot;
by a Council convened in Constantinople in 587.
Gregory reportedly reacted negatively to the Patriarch&#x27;s title, claiming that &quot;whoever calls himself universal bishop [the imprecise Latin translation of &quot;Ecumenical Patriarch&quot;], or desires this title, is, by his pride, the precursor to the Antichrist.&quot;

<text>All Hallows-on-the-Wall is a Church of England church located in the City of London. Its name refers to its location, inside and adjacent to London Wall, the former city wall.

==Current use==
From 2014 All Hallows became the headquarters of the urban youth charity XLP, and the home of City Gates Church, London. XLP creates positive futures for young people in impoverished urban areas. It combats bullying and intimidation, weapons, and gangs. It develops a response to boredom due to a lack of organised activities, absent parents, and living in areas with a high crime rate. The church is often used to host XLP events and has received an annual visit from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

City Gates Church is a congregation with roots in the British New Church Movement, and Ichthus Christian Fellowship. It meets at All Hallows at 11am every week, and is the first community to hold regular services there since 1941. City Gates builds on All Hallows’ previous traditions of serving the poor. It runs the Better Job Project, English Conversation Classes, live music nights and other events. Covid19 brought activities to a halt. The church resumed its meetings in September 2021, and returned to serving the community with its projects in December 2022.

==History==
The present church was constructed by George Dance the Younger in 1767, replacing an earlier church built some time in the early 12th century on a bastion of the old Roman wall. It became renowned for its hermits, who lived in cells in the church. All Hallows escaped destruction in the Great Fire of London in 1666 due to its position under the wall, but subsequently fell into dereliction.

Dance rebuilt the church when he was only 24 years old. He had recently returned from Italy where he had conducted detailed studies of Classical buildings. The new All Hallows took its inspiration from the Classical world and was remarkably simple in form, with no aisles; its interior consists solely of a barrel-vaulted nave with a half-dome apse at the far end, with decoration deriving from the ancient Temple of Venus and Rome in the city of Rome. Attached Ionic columns support a frieze, rather than the usual entablature. The exterior is plain and of brick, except for the stone-faced tower above the porch at the west end.

The church was noted for its work in offering its services to the poor; many workers, including women in domestic service, would take the early trains into the City to avoid peak fares. A demand for services and refreshment in the Parish led to the vicar of the church, the Reverend Sir Montague Fowler, 4th Baronet, third son of Sir John Fowler, to operate services for their benefit. This was a popular initiative (which also had tents constructed in the churchyard to provide refreshments) which led to the construction of the buildings behind the church which were to be used as an educational institute. Because of this the church had one of the largest congregations in the City at a time when many City churches were beginning to seem redundant.

All Hallows was damaged during the Second World War but was restored in the early 1960s. It is a guild church associated with the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, which has held its annual elections in the church for over 600 years. Until 1994, it was the headquarters of the Council for the Care of Churches. On 14 December 1994 the Council for the Care of Churches and the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England moved out of All Hallows, leaving the church empty for two and a half years. Then in April 1997 the London and South East Team of Christian Aid were given use of the building and Garth Hewitt, the Team Leader, was appointed Guild Vicar and licensed by the Bishop of London on 18 June 1997. All Hallows went on to become the centre of a thriving community for Christian Aid and its supporters, becoming a centre for issues of Justice, Development and Peace. Under the wing of Christian Aid other organisations have been based at All Hallows, including the Community Fundraising Unit of Christian Aid, the Amos Trust (a small charity with a commitment to justice issues), The Time of Our Lives (the archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s Millennium youth event organised from the crypt of All Hallows), and Greenbelt festivals (an arts festival with a Christian viewpoint and a partner of Christian Aid).
The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

==Notable parishioners==

<text>Charles A. Graner Jr. (born November 10, 1968) is an American former soldier and corrections officer who was court-martialed for prisoner abuse after the 2003–2004 Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal. Along with other soldiers of his Army Reserve unit, the 372nd Military Police Company, Graner was accused of allowing and inflicting sexual, physical, and psychological abuse on Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib prison, a notorious prison in Baghdad during the United States&#x27; occupation of Iraq.

On January 14, 2005, Graner was found guilty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice on charges of conspiracy to maltreat detainees, failing to protect detainees from abuse, cruelty, and maltreatment, as well as charges of assault, indecency, and dereliction of duty. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, demotion to private, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay and allowances. Charges of adultery and obstruction of justice were dropped before trial. On August 6, 2011, Graner was released from the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, after serving years of his ten-year sentence.

==Early life==
Graner grew up in Baldwin, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. After graduating from high school in 1986, Graner attended the University of Pittsburgh for two years before dropping out to join the Marine Corps Reserve in April 1988. He had the Marine Corps emblem and the letters &quot;USMC&quot; tattooed on his upper right biceps.

In 1990, Graner married Staci M. Dean, a 19-year-old from Ohiopyle, Pennsylvania. The couple had two children. Trained as a military policeman, he served in the Persian Gulf War in 1991. He was in the Marines until May 1996, when he left with the rank of lance corporal.

Graner was deployed during the Gulf War, serving with the 2nd MP Co, originally of 4th FSSG, 4th Marine Division, a Marine Reserve unit based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On January 11, 1991, he arrived in Saudi Arabia, taking part in Operation Desert Storm. From there, he traveled to the largest prisoner-of-war camp near the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, where he worked for about six weeks.

==Prison guard==
After his marriage, he moved to Butler, Pennsylvania, a steel industry area in southwestern Pennsylvania. In 1994, he began working as a corrections officer at Fayette County Prison in a shift with a &quot;no-nonsense reputation.&quot; Once, Graner was accused of putting mace in a new guard&#x27;s coffee as a joke, causing him to be sick.

In May 1996, he moved to the State Correctional Institution, Greene, a maximum-security prison in Greene County, Pennsylvania. Almost 70% of the inmates were black, many from large cities, but it was located in a rural part of the state and more than 90% of the guards were white. Guards at the prison were accused of beating and sexually assaulting prisoners and conducting cavity searches in view of other prisoners. There were also reports of racism, including reports of guards writing &quot;KKK&quot; in the blood of a beaten prisoner. In 1998, two guards were fired and 20 others were suspended, demoted or reprimanded for prisoner abuse.

In 1998, a prisoner accused Graner and three other guards of planting a razor blade in his food, causing his mouth to bleed when he ate it. The prisoner accused the guards of first ignoring his cries for help and then punching and kicking him when they took him to the nurse. Graner was accused of telling him to &quot;Shut up, nigger, before we kill you.&quot; The allegations were denied; although a federal magistrate judge ruled that the charges had &quot;arguable merit in fact and law,&quot; the case was dismissed when the prisoner disappeared after his release. Graner and four other guards were accused of beating another prisoner who had deliberately flooded his cell, taunting anti-capital punishment protesters, using racial epithets and telling a Muslim inmate he had rubbed pork all over his tray of food.

A second lawsuit involving Graner was brought by a prisoner who claimed that guards made him stand on one foot while they handcuffed and tripped him. This allegation was ruled to have been made too late under the statute of limitations.

==Domestic abuse==
In May 1997, Graner&#x27;s wife and mother of their two children filed for divorce and sought a protection order, saying Graner had threatened to kill her. A six-month order was granted, unopposed by Graner. Shortly after the first one expired, Staci Dean was granted a second protection order, saying Graner had come to her house, thrown her against some furniture, thrown her on the bed, grabbed her arm and hit her face with her arm. Three years later, Dean called police after Graner came to her house and attacked her. Dean said Graner had &quot;yanked me out of bed by my hair, dragging me and all the covers into the hall and tried to throw me down the steps.&quot; Afterwards, Graner called a friend of Dean&#x27;s and allegedly said, &quot;I have nothing if she&#x27;s not my wife, she&#x27;s dead.&quot; Graner admitted the attack and a third order of protection was granted.

Soon after, an order of protection was granted against Graner to protect his estranged wife. This resulted from Graner&#x27;s comment to Dean that &quot;she could keep his guns, because he did not need them for what he was going to do to the plaintiff.&quot;

==Abu Ghraib==

In November 2003, Graner was awarded a commendation from the Army for serving as an MP in Iraq. Graner held the rank of specialist in the company during his tour of duty in Iraq.

===Allegations===

Thirteen prisoners were interviewed by military investigators after the abuse allegations emerged. Eight of them named Graner as one of the abusers, and the other five described a person fitting his description. The investigation report named Graner as a ringleader of the abuse.

One of the prisoners, Kasim Mehaddi Hilas, said that one day he asked Graner for the time so that he could pray. Graner handcuffed him to the bars of a cell window and left him there, feet dangling off the floor, for nearly five hours. On another occasion, Graner and other soldiers tied a prisoner to a bed and sodomized him with a phosphoric light while another soldier took photographs.

Another prisoner, Abdou Hussain Saad Faleh, said Graner forced him to stand on a food box, naked except for a blanket. Another soldier then put a bag over his head and electrodes on his fingers, toes and penis. The picture of this incident was one of the first pictures whose publication prompted the investigation. A third prisoner, Mohanded Juma Juma, said Graner often threw food into the toilets and told the prisoners to eat it.

Jeremy Sivits, a soldier who pleaded guilty to charges relating to the Abu Ghraib investigation, alleged that Graner once punched a prisoner in the head so hard that he lost consciousness.

===Timeline===

* 2002: Graner joins the Army Reserve.
* May 5, 2003: Graner called to active duty in Iraq.
* 2003–2004 Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse:
** Specialist Sabrina Harman testified as to Graner&#x27;s assignment, &quot;It is Graner and Frederick&#x27;s job [...] to get these people to talk&quot; for military intelligence officers and for &#x27;OGA,&#x27; short for &#x27;Other Government Agency,&#x27; a nickname for the CIA.&quot;
** Graner appears in several pictures with his fellow guards Lynndie England and Sabrina Harman, giving the thumbs up in front of nude prisoners. In one photo, Graner poses over the dead body of Manadel al-Jamadi, an Iraqi prisoner; a small patch of blood can be seen on al-Jamadi&#x27;s right temple and his eyes are sealed closed with tape. According to Spc. Jason Kenner&#x27;s testimony, al-Jamadi was brought to the prison by Navy SEALs in good health; Kenner says he saw that al-Jamadi looked extensively bruised when he was brought out of the showers, dead. According to Kenner a &quot;battle&quot; took place among CIA and military interrogators over who should dispose of the body. Capt. Donald Reese, company commander of 372nd Military Police Company, gave testimony about al-Jamadi&#x27;s death, saying he saw the dead prisoner. Reese testified, &quot;I was told that when he was brought in, he was combative, that they took him up to the room and during the interrogation he passed.&quot; Reese stated the corpse was locked in a shower room overnight, which is where he first saw him. Reese says he was first told the man had died of a heart attack, but when he saw him he &quot;was bleeding from the head, nose, mouth&quot;. The body was then autopsied, concluding that the cause of death was a blood clot from trauma.
** Prisoner Kasim Mehaddi Hilas testifies regarding his experiences at Abu Ghraib, telling investigators that Graner had cuffed him to the bars of a cell window, after Hilas had asked Graner what time it was because he wanted to pray. Graner left him, feet dangling above the floor, for almost five hours. Hilas also detailed events he had witnessed of Graner and some of his fellow soldiers sodomizing and otherwise abusing other detainees. These events were also detailed by other prisoners including some of the victims themselves. According to Hilas, Graner also &quot;repeatedly threw the detainees&#x27; meals into the toilets and said, &#x27;Eat it.
** Spec. Joseph M. Darby, who reported what was happening in the prison, stated that he had asked Graner, when he was the MP in charge of the tier&#x27;s night shift, &quot;if he had any photographs of the cell where the shooting took place.&quot; Darby received two CDs of photographs from Graner. Darby told investigators, &quot;I thought the discs just had pictures of Iraq, the cell where the shooting occurred.&quot; However, the discs contained &quot;hundreds of photographs showing naked detainees being abused by U.S. soldiers.&quot; Feeling that what he had seen was &quot;just wrong&quot;, Darby was compelled to do something about it. Upon being confronted by Darby, Graner responded, &quot;The Christian in me says it&#x27;s wrong, but the corrections officer in me says, &#x27;I love to make a grown man piss himself.&quot;
** Julie Scelfo and Rod Nordland of &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported, &quot;One military investigator wrote in his notes on Graner: &#x27;the biggest S.O.B. on earth,&#x27; a comment he underlined twice.&quot;
* May 14, 2004: U.S. Army files seven criminal charges against Graner under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, with punishments ranging up to 24½ years in prison, forfeiture of pay, reduction in rank and a dishonorable discharge:

:#Conspiracy to maltreat detainees;
:#Dereliction of duty for willfully failing to protect detainees from abuse, cruelty and maltreatment;
:#Assaulting detainees;
:# Committing indecent acts;
:#Adultery;
:#Obstruction of justice;
:# Maltreatment of detainees.
: The charges of adultery and obstruction of justice were dropped before the first trial began. Later, other charges were dropped, leaving only the charges for conspiracy to maltreat detainees, assault and committing indecent acts. This made the maximum penalty 17½ years instead of 24½ years.
*May 19, 2004: Graner is arraigned along with Staff Sergeant Ivan L. &quot;Chip&quot; Frederick II and Sergeant Javal Davis. All of them waive their right to have charges read aloud. Their pleas were deferred. On the same day, Jeremy C. Sivits, the first soldier to go on trial, is sentenced to the maximum penalty of one year in prison and a bad conduct discharge.
* June 25, 2004: Spc. Israel Rivera, a military intelligence analyst, testifies at a hearing in Baghdad that will decide whether Spc. Sabrina Harman should be court-martialed. Rivera says Graner shouted &quot;homosexual slurs&quot; at three naked prisoners, &quot;ordering them to crawl along the ground so their genitalia had to drag along the floor.&quot; According to Rivera, &quot;Graner was shouting things like, &#x27;Are you guys fucking in there&#x27; and &#x27;fucking fags.
* Three key witnesses refused to testify against Graner during a secret hearing on the grounds they might incriminate themselves (see Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution):
**Lieutenant Colonel Steven L. Jordan, who as director of the Joint Interrogation and Debriefing Center at the prison oversaw the interrogations;
**Captain Donald J. Reese, who was commander of the 372nd Military Police Company, in which Graner served; and
**Adel Nakhla, civilian translator, employed by private military contractor Titan Corporation, assigned to the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade; mentioned in the Taguba Report as suspect.

===Court-martial===

====Article 32 hearing====
Due to security problems with holding pre-trial hearings in Baghdad, the case was transferred to Germany. On August 23, Graner appeared before military judge Colonel James Pohl at a high-security Army base in the city of Mannheim in southwest Germany. On that day, Article 32 hearings were held. These preliminary hearings usually function as an arraignment and allow the judge to hear and decide on motions made by the prosecutor and the defense. Graner appeared with Specialist Megan Ambuhl, along with his civilian attorneys and appointed military defense lawyers.

During the Article 32 hearing, attorneys for Harman and Graner made discovery motions. Pohl set a deadline of September 10 for the government to provide the defense team with the documents requested, and ordered the release of a U.S. Army report performed by the Criminal Investigational Division on investigative procedures, as well as the Schlesinger panel report.

Graner&#x27;s attorney (as well as attorneys for several others charged) also moved to suppress evidence of statements made to Army investigators during interrogations, as well as seizure of a computer. Also requested was a change of venue, because some witnesses could not be compelled to come to Iraq to testify. In addition, the defense sought immunity from prosecution for several people so they may testify for the defense. The judge denied all three motions, and also ruled that video testimony and depositions could be used as evidence.

====October 22 hearing====
Another pre-trial hearing was held on October 22, at Camp Victory in Baghdad, with Pohl again presiding as judge. Pohl set January 7, 2005, as the trial date and again denied a defense motion to grant immunity to several witnesses so they could testify without fear of incrimination. On November 11, Lieutenant Colonel Fred Taylor, a judge advocate in the regional defense counsel&#x27;s office at Camp Victory, notified Graner that the military judge ordered that all further hearings in the case would be held at Fort Hood, Texas.

====Not guilty plea and court-martial member selection====
The trial officially began on January 7, at the Williams Judicial Center in Fort Hood, with Colonel James Pohl presiding. A ten-member, all-male court-martial was seated, consisting of four officers and six enlisted men—all of whom had served in either Iraq or Afghanistan. Under military law, three fourths of the members must vote guilty to convict a person of each charge.

Graner entered a not-guilty plea to each of the five charges. Two officers detailed as members of the court were not seated—Colonel Allen Batschelet for saying he was embarrassed as an Army officer after seeing the photos and had strong views about the case, and Lieutenant Colonel Mark Kormos by the prosecutors for no reason given.

During the session a list of potential witnesses was also made public. It included three other soldiers in Graner&#x27;s unit from western Pennsylvania: Captain Donald Reese of New Stanton, Specialist Jeremy Sivits of Bedford County, and Sergeant Joseph Darby of Somerset County. Reese was the unit commander and had been reprimanded in connection with Abu Ghraib; Sivits had already pleaded guilty in a plea bargain; Darby was the soldier who first reported the situation at Abu Ghraib. At the hearing several other possible witnesses were listed, including the prerecorded video depositions of three Iraqi prisoners—two for the prosecution and one for the defense. Graner&#x27;s lawyer, Guy Womack, said he was not sure whether Graner would testify for himself.

After the hearing journalists interviewed Graner outside the courtroom, where Graner expressed a positive attitude, saying &quot;Whatever happens here is going to happen. I still try to stay positive.&quot;

====Testimony====
Opening statements began on January 10. During this hearing, witness testimony began. Three soldiers in Graner&#x27;s unit testified; the first was Specialist Matthew Wisdom, who first reported the situation at Abu Ghraib. Wisdom said that Graner had enjoyed beating inmates (saying that he had laughed, whistled, and sung) and was the one who first thought of arranging the prisoners in naked human pyramids and other positions. On this day the Military Judge, Michael Hunter, banned any further reporting of the hearing.

Testimony continued the next day, as Syrian foreign fighter Ameed al-Sheikh told the court in video testimony that Graner had beaten him while he was recovering from a bullet wound. Al-Sheikh described Graner as the &quot;primary torturer&quot; and said that he had forced him to eat pork, drink alcohol, and thank Jesus for keeping him alive. Another detainee, Hussein Mutar, testified that Graner had forced him, like al-Sheikh, to eat pork, drink alcohol, and curse Islam. He was also forced to masturbate in public and was one of the men stacked into a pyramid naked.

On January 11, military prosecutors also presented evidence not publicly released, including a video of forced group masturbation and a picture of a female prisoner being forced to show her breasts.

====Following orders====
The main defense was that Graner was following orders from, and supervised by, intelligence officers. Graner and others testified that many senior officers were aware of the activities and actively supported them. This is why he was not worried about taking and distributing the photographs which were later used against him. Referring to military intelligence, Graner testified &quot;I nearly beat an MI detainee to death with MI there&quot; before Pohl cut him off.

A formal complaint about the abuse was filed by Specialist Matthew Wisdom in November 2003 but was ignored by the military. Private Ivan Frederick (previously convicted of abuse) said he had consulted six senior officers, ranging from captains to lieutenant-colonels, about the guards&#x27; actions but was never told to stop. Despite this, the prosecution did not call any senior officers to testify. Womack suggests that this was not because they &quot;just forgot&quot; to do so.

White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales had issued a memo which defined torture very narrowly as &quot;intentionally causing permanent damage to vital organs or permanent emotional trauma&quot;. This would have excluded Graner&#x27;s acts of intimidation. However the prosecution argued that even if he was following orders from senior officers, he should have known that the orders were illegal.

====Verdict====
On January 15, 2005, Graner was found guilty of assault, battery, conspiracy, maltreatment of detainees, committing indecent acts and dereliction of duty and sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment, reduction in rank to private, a dishonorable discharge, and the loss of all pay and benefits.

Defense lawyer Guy Womack contended that Graner and the six other Abu Ghraib guards charged with abuses were being scapegoated. For example, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in 2004 that a torture position known as a &quot;Palestinian hanging&quot;, where a prisoner is suspended by their hands behind their back, was approved by the Bush administration for use in CIA interrogations (termed an &quot;enhanced interrogation technique&quot; by the CIA).

Graner&#x27;s mother, Irma Graner said, &quot;You know it&#x27;s the higher-ups that should be on trial ... they let the little guys take the fall for them. But the truth will come out eventually.&quot;

==Life post-trial==

Graner was imprisoned in the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Leavenworth, Kansas.

In 2005, while serving time for his role in the Abu Ghraib scandal, Graner married fellow Abu Ghraib guard Megan Ambuhl. Graner was in a relationship with fellow soldier, Lynndie England, and they had a child. Ambuhl was not permitted to see him for the first 2½ years of his incarceration; it was a proxy wedding with a friend. Ambuhl previously pleaded guilty to two minor charges but served no jail time and was discharged.

Graner was released from prison after serving years of a ten-year sentence. He remained on parole until December 25, 2014.

Graner and his wife have declined interview requests.

<text>Bicycle Thieves (), also known as The Bicycle Thief, is a 1948 Italian neorealist drama film directed by Vittorio De Sica. It follows the story of a poor father searching in post-World War II Rome for his stolen bicycle, without which he will lose the job which was to be the salvation of his young family.

Adapted for the screen by Cesare Zavattini from the 1946 novel by Luigi Bartolini, and starring Lamberto Maggiorani as the desperate father and Enzo Staiola as his plucky young son, &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; received an Academy Honorary Award (most outstanding foreign language film) in 1950, and in 1952 was deemed the greatest film of all time by &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine&#x27;s poll of filmmakers and critics; fifty years later another poll organized by the same magazine ranked it sixth among the greatest-ever films. In the 2012 version of the list the film ranked 33rd among critics and 10th among directors.

The film was also cited by Turner Classic Movies as one of the most influential films in cinema history, and it is considered part of the canon of classic cinema. The film was voted number 3 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo, and number 4 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. It was also included on the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage’s 100 Italian films to be saved, a list of 100 films that &quot;have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978.&quot;

==Plot==
In post-World War II Rome, Antonio Ricci desperately needs work to support his wife Maria, his son Bruno and his small baby. He is offered a job posting advertising bills but tells Maria he cannot accept because the job requires a bicycle. Maria resolutely strips the bed of her dowry bedsheetsprized possessions for a poor familyand takes them to the pawn shop, where they bring enough to redeem Antonio&#x27;s bicycle.

On his first day of work, Antonio is at the top of a ladder when a young man steals his bicycle. Antonio runs after him but is thrown off the trail by the thief&#x27;s confederates. The police file Antonio&#x27;s complaint but say that there is little they can do.

Advised that stolen goods often surface at the Piazza Vittorio market, Antonio and his son go there with several friends. They find a bicycle frame that might be Antonio&#x27;s, but the vendors refuse to allow them to examine the serial number. They call over a carabiniere, who orders the vendors to allow him to read the serial number. It does not match that of the missing bicycle, but the officer won&#x27;t allow them to examine it for themselves.

At the Porta Portese market, Antonio and Bruno spot someone he believes to be the thief with an old man. The thief eludes them and the old man feigns ignorance. They follow him into a church where he too slips away from them.

Antonio pursues the thief into a brothel, whose denizens eject them. In the street, hostile neighbors gather as Antonio accuses the thief, who conveniently falls into a fit for which the crowd blames Antonio. Bruno fetches a policeman, who searches the thief&#x27;s apartment without success. The policeman tells Antonio the case is weakAntonio has no witnesses and the neighbors are certain to provide the thief with an alibi. Antonio and Bruno leave in despair amid jeers and threats from the crowd.

Their way home takes them to the Stadio Nazionale PNF football stadium. Antonio sees an unattended bicycle near a doorway and after much anguished indecision, instructs Bruno to take the tram to a stop nearby and wait. Antonio circles the unattended bicycle and jumps on it. Instantly, the hue and cry is raised and Brunowho has missed the tramis stunned to see his father pursued, surrounded and pulled from the bicycle. As Antonio is being muscled toward the police station, the bicycle&#x27;s owner notices Bruno in tears and, in a moment of compassion, tells the others to release Antonio.

Antonio and Bruno then walk off slowly amid a buffeting crowd. Antonio fights back tears and Bruno takes his hand.

==Production==
&quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; is the best-known work of Italian neorealism, a movement that informally began with Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Rome, Open City&quot; (1945) and brought a new degree of realism to Italian cinema. De Sica had just made &quot;Shoeshine&quot; (1946), but was unable to get financial backing from any major studio for the film, so he raised the money himself from friends. Wanting to portray the poverty and unemployment of post-war Italy, he co-wrote a script with Cesare Zavattini and others using only the title and few plot devices of a little-known novel of the time by poet and artist Luigi Bartolini. Following the precepts of neorealism, De Sica shot only on location (that is, no studio sets) and cast only untrained actors. (Lamberto Maggiorani, for example, was a factory worker.) That some actors&#x27; roles paralleled their lives off screen added realism to the film. De Sica cast Maggiorani when he had brought his young son to an audition for the film. He later cast the 8-year-old Enzo Staiola when he noticed the young boy watching the film&#x27;s production on a street while helping his father sell flowers. 

The film&#x27;s final shot of Antonio and Bruno walking away from the camera into the distance is an homage to many of the films of Charlie Chaplin, who was De Sica&#x27;s favourite filmmaker.
==Title==
The original Italian title is &quot;Ladri di biciclette&quot;. It literally translates into English as &quot;thieves of bicycles&quot;; both &quot;ladri&quot; and &quot;biciclette&quot; are plural. In Bartolini&#x27;s novel, the title referred to a post-war culture of rampant thievery and disrespect for civil order, countered only by an inept police force and indifferent allied occupiers.

When the film was screened in the United States in 1949, Bosley Crowther referred to it as &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; in his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and this came to be the title by which the film was known in English. When the film was re-released in the late-1990s, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; film critic Bob Graham said that he preferred that version, stating, &quot;Purists have criticized the English title of the film as a poor translation of the Italian &quot;ladri&quot;, which is plural. What blindness! &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; is one of those wonderful titles whose power does not sink in until the film is over&quot;. The 2007 Criterion Collection release in North America uses the title &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot;.
==Reception==
===Critical response===
When &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; was released in Italy, it was viewed with hostility and as portraying Italians in a negative way. Italian critic Guido Aristarco praised it, but also complained that &quot;sentimentality might at times take the place of artistic emotion.&quot; Fellow Italian neorealist film director Luchino Visconti criticized the film, saying that it was a mistake to use a professional actor to dub over Lamberto Maggiorani&#x27;s dialogue. Luigi Bartolini, the author of the novel from which de Sica drew his title, was highly critical of the film, feeling that the spirit of his book had been thoroughly betrayed because his protagonist was a middle-class intellectual and his theme was the breakdown of civil order.

Contemporary reviews elsewhere were positive. Bosley Crowther, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, lauded the film and its message in his review. He wrote, &quot;Again the Italians have sent us a brilliant and devastating film in Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s rueful drama of modern city life, &quot;The Bicycle Thief.&quot; Widely and fervently heralded by those who had seen it abroad (where it already has won several prizes at various film festivals), this heart-tearing picture of frustration, which came to [the World Theater] yesterday, bids fair to fulfill all the forecasts of its absolute triumph over here. For once more the talented De Sica, who gave us the shattering &quot;Shoeshine&quot;, that desperately tragic demonstration of juvenile corruption in post-war Rome, has laid hold upon and sharply imaged in simple and realistic terms a majorindeed, a fundamental and universaldramatic theme. It is the isolation and loneliness of the little man in this complex social world that is ironically blessed with institutions to comfort and protect mankind&quot;. Pierre Leprohon wrote in &quot;Cinéma D&#x27;Aujourd&#x27;hui&quot; that &quot;what must not be ignored on the social level is that the character is shown not at the beginning of a crisis but at its outcome. One need only to look at his face, his uncertain gait, his hesitant or fearful attitudes to understand that Ricci is already a victim, a diminished man who has lost his confidence.&quot; Then Paris-based Lotte H. Eisner called it the best Italian film since World War II, and UK critic Robert Winnington called it &quot;the most successful record of any foreign film in British cinema.&quot;

When the film was re-released in the late 1990s Bob Graham, staff film critic for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, gave the drama a positive review: &quot;The roles are played by non-actors, Lamberto Maggiorani as the father and Enzo Staiola as the solemn boy, who sometimes appears to be a miniature man. They bring a grave dignity to De Sica&#x27;s unblinking view of post-war Italy. The wheel of life turns and grinds people down; the man who was riding high in the morning is brought low by nightfall. It is impossible to imagine this story in any other form than De Sica&#x27;s. The new black-and-white print has an extraordinary range of grey tones that get darker as life closes in&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film reviewer Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;&quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; is so well-entrenched as an official masterpiece that it is a little startling to visit it again after many years and realize that it is still alive and has strength and freshness. Given an honorary Oscar in 1949, routinely voted one of the greatest films of all time, revered as one of the foundation stones of Italian neorealism, it is a simple, powerful film about a man who needs a job&quot;. Ebert added the film to his &quot;The Great Movies&quot; list. In 2020, A. O. Scott praised the film in an essay entitled &quot;Why You Should Still Care About &#x27;Bicycle Thieves&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; is a fixture on the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; and directors&#x27; polls of the greatest films ever made. The film ranked 1st and 7th on critics&#x27; poll in 1952 and 1962 respectively. It ranked 11th on the magazine&#x27;s 1992 Critics&#x27; poll, 45th in 2002 &quot;Critics&#x27; Poll&quot; and 6th on the 2002 &quot;Directors&#x27; Top Ten Poll&quot;. It was slightly lower in the 2012 directors&#x27; poll, 10th and 33rd on the 2012 critics&#x27; poll. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked the film at number 37 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. The film was voted at No. 99 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the prominent French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 2008.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films. The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Values&quot;.

&quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; has continued to gain very high praise from contemporary critics, with the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reporting 99% of 70 reviews as of April 2022 as positive, with an average rating of 9.20/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;An Italian neorealism exemplar, &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; thrives on its non-flashy performances and searing emotion.&quot;

==Legacy==
Many directors have cited the film as a major influence including Satyajit Ray, Ken Loach, Giorgio Mangiamele, Bimal Roy, Anurag Kashyap, Balu Mahendra, Vetrimaaran and Basu Chatterjee.

The film was noteworthy for film directors of the Iranian New Wave, such as Jafar Panahi and Dariush Mehrjui.

The film was one of 39 foreign films recommended by Martin Scorsese to Colin Levy.

It was parodied in the film &quot;The Icicle Thief&quot; (1989).

The film features incidentally in the 1992 Robert Altman film &quot;The Player&quot;. A Hollywood studio executive (played by Tim Robbins) tracks a screenwriter to a theater showing &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; and stages what he represents as a chance meeting.

Norman Loftis&#x27;s film &quot;Messenger&quot; (1994) is considered to be a remake of &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot;.

The episode &quot;The Thief&quot; from the American comedy-drama series &quot;Master of None&quot; is heavily influenced by &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot;.

<text>George Devey (1820, London – 1886, Hastings, Sussex) was an English architect notable for his work on country houses and their estates, especially those belonging to the Rothschild family. The second son of Frederick and Ann Devey, he was born and educated in London.

After leaving school he studied art, under John Sell Cotman and James Duffield Harding with an ambition to become a professional artist, but later trained as an architect.

==Career==
During his professional career Devey had a London office in Great Marlborough Street, where he specialised in country houses and estate cottages and lodges.

His first important work, in 1850, was on a group of cottages at the entrance gate of Penshurst Place in Kent, where he modified and added to existing buildings, to create a picturesque composition, with the intention of creating an illusion of genuine antiquity.
He worked extensively for the Duke of Sutherland at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire where he designed lodges and cottages in the vernacular style of the Sussex Weald. He often used tiles and timbers on external walls, in a way evocative or earlier periods, but always in a slightly differing way to the original. This style he adapted and personalised until it had his own distinctive stamp. Devey&#x27;s style was later developed by other architects such as Richard Norman Shaw and Charles Voysey, both of whom studied under him, and were to become be founder members of the Arts and Crafts movement a generation later.

He often tried to create an artificial impression of a building&#x27;s age, and of its development over time, by combining the styles and materials of different eras. For instance at St Alban&#x27;s Court at Nonington in Kent he built a brick upper level over a ragstone ground floor, the irregular join giving that gives the impression the stone part was from an earlier, ruined, structure.

== Commissions for the Rothschild family==
Despite having been in practice since the 1850s, business was slow until he was discovered by the Rothschild family. This international dynasty of bankers would provide Devey with numerous commissions and ensure a steady stream of work.

Devey first appears in Rothschild account books as the architect for a new school at Hulcott, and the rebuilding of the parsonage there. In 1863 he came to attention of Sir Anthony de Rothschild when he designed Buckland School for the vicar Edward Bonus on a site donated by the Rothschilds. He succeeded Joseph Paxton&#x27;s son-in-law George H. Stokes as Baron Mayer de Rothschild&#x27;s architect for the estate village at Mentmore, designing the stables and riding school there between 1869 and 1870. After the Baron&#x27;s death in 1877, Devey continued in the employ of his daughter Hannah de Rothschild building cottages at Wingrave and Mentmore. His most notable works on the Mentmore Estate are: Rosebery Arms at Cheddington, the School House at Cheddington, and the Thatched Lodge, which stands at the end of a long avenue approach to Mentmore Towers.

Devey was largely responsible for Ascott House, a neo-Tudor extravaganza developed from a small half-timbered farmhouse. He began work there in 1874 for Leopold de Rothschild. This house, conceived as a small hunting box, expanded, the intention was to make the house seem as though it had grown and developed over centuries. Devey designed numerous half-timbered extensions. He was still working on the house at his death in 1886, when his partner James Williams took over the project. Ascott House is probably Devey&#x27;s greatest monument, although further half-timbered extensions continued to be added to this house as late as the 1930s. Devey was also responsible for the large cottages on the Green, near the entrance of Ascott House, (now the Ascott Estate Office); these are very similar to those he designed at St. Albans&#x27;s Court, Kent, in the late 1880s.

A further Rothschild house by Devey was Aston Clinton, where he worked with George Stokes. The Italianate house with its huge porte-cochere is now demolished, a casualty of the huge country house demolitions of the 1950s. However, the Lodge and stables by Devey still stand, as does his West Lodge at Aston Clinton.

Although the records were destroyed in World War II, he is also believed to have worked on the &quot;improvements&quot; at Tring Park between 1874 and 1878, which involved turning a house designed by Sir Christopher Wren into a &quot;dix-huitieme&quot; French chateau complete with mansard roof. Devey later built a house very similar to the transformed Tring in Lennox Gardens, London, for a Mrs. Hunloke.

Devey was capable of working on more than one project at a time. In 1876, Alice de Rothschild commissioned him to build her a house at Eythrope in the Vale of Aylesbury. After the plans were drawn up, his patroness decided water at night was bad for her health Since the house was in a bend of the River Thame, rather than abandon the site, she decided Devey must design a house without bedrooms, and she would decamp every evening to her brother&#x27;s home, Waddesdon Manor. The result was the Eythrope Water Pavilion, one of the smaller of the Rothschild houses of Buckinghamshire, its design is an unostentatious complement to the great faux-chateau four miles away of Waddesdon Manor. Today (with a bedroom wing added in the 1920s) it is the only Rothschild mansion still in private hands in the Vale of Aylesbury. The Rothschilds also commissioned him to undertake work at their newly acquired property The King&#x27;s Head in Aylesbury itself. His work mainly consisted of creating what was considered a typical Tudor experience in the 14th century coaching inn, but actually followed Victorian conventions of the time. Much of his work here was not corrected until after the property was given to the National Trust, when a more authentic Tudor appearance was restored, though elements of his design can still be seen. He designed in Hampshire for George Carnegie, 9th Earl of Northesk

Devey had an interest in garden design and played an important role in not only the houses he designed, but also in garden buildings and follies. At Ascott this included the thatched half-timbered summer house, or skating hut overlooking the circular lily pool. He has also been credited with the design of the neo-Grecian temple terminating the avenue of mirror herbaceous borders, but the style is to very different that he normally employed.

==Other patrons==
The Shropshire Archives hold an archive on the rebuilding of Adderley Hall by Henry Reginald Corbet, who invited Devey &quot;to inspect the old house of Adderley to make it habitable&quot;. Devey concluded that little could be done on account of its outlook and recommended it be pulled down and a new hall placed on an elevated position to the northwest. Devey&#x27;s plans that were not to his clients&#x27; satisfaction and following discussions, led by Mrs Corbet, a new design was agreed.

In about 1875, Richard Henry Ainsworth employed Devey to extend and modernise Smithills Hall, his home near Bolton.

==Personal life==
Devey&#x27;s father was a London solicitor whose family originated from Worfield, Shropshire and Pattingham, Staffordshire. His mother, Ann, was the daughter of Durs Egg, a London gunmaker born in Switzerland and the artist Augustus Leopold Egg was a second cousin. 

Little is known of Devey&#x27;s personal life. As a young man, he had been in love with Flora Hoskins, the daughter of the vicar of Chiddingstone, near Penshurst. He left her £5,000 in his will &quot;on account of the engagement so cruelly broken off between us&quot;. In 1857, she married a clergy man, the Revd. H. W. Streatfield, of the Chiddingstone Castle family. He died in 1866 and Devey proposed to her again (according to W. H. Godfrey in &quot;R.I.B.A Journal&quot;, 3rd series, XII (1906), p. 505). Owing to &quot;certain divergences he was preferred to as a friend&quot;. The divergences were probably religious. Devey later supported the Theistic Church of the Revd. Charles Vosey (father of the architect C. F. A. Voysey).

He never married; on the 1881 census he is recorded living with an elderly aunt, cousin and elder brother at 12 Pelham Crescent, Hastings. He died there in November 1886. While never a household name, in the world of architecture he does have considerable standing. There is no doubt that his style was the forerunner of the arts and crafts school of design.

<text>The yellow pages are telephone directories of businesses, organized by category rather than alphabetically by business name, in which advertising is sold. The directories were originally printed on yellow paper, as opposed to white pages for non-commercial listings. The traditional term &quot;yellow pages&quot; is now also applied to online directories of businesses.

In many countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere, &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; (or any applicable local translations), as well as the &quot;Walking Fingers&quot; logo introduced in the 1970s by the Bell System–era AT&amp;T, are registered trademarks, though the owner varies from country to country, usually being held by the main national telephone company (or a subsidiary or spinoff thereof). However, in the United States, neither the name nor the logo was registered as trademarks by AT&amp;T, and they are freely used by several publishers.

== History ==
The name and concept of &quot;yellow pages&quot; came about in 1883, when a printer in Cheyenne, Wyoming, working on a regular telephone directory, ran out of white paper so they used yellow paper instead. In 1886, Reuben H. Donnelley created the first official Yellow Pages directory for the city of Chicago.

Today, the expression &quot;yellow pages&quot; is used globally in both English-speaking and non-English speaking countries. In the United States, it refers to the category, while in some other countries it is a registered name and therefore a proper noun. The term &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; is not a registered name within the United States and is freely used by many companies. Telephone directories using the Internet domain name &quot;yellowpages.&quot;cc&quot;&quot; (where &quot;cc&quot; is the ccTLD) exist in 75 countries. They are edited by many different phone companies and directory publishers, mostly independently.

A particular yellow pages is a print directory which provides an alphabetical listing of businesses within a specific geographical area (e.g. the Tampa Bay area), which are segregated under headings for similar types of businesses, such as plumbers. Traditionally, these directories have been published by the local phone company, but there are numerous independent directory publishers. Some yellow pages publishers focus on a particular demographic (e.g. Christian yellow pages or business pages).

Yellow pages directories are usually published annually and distributed for free to all residences and businesses within a given coverage area. The majority of listings are plain and in small black text. The yellow-pages publishers profit by selling advertising space or listings under each heading. Advertising may be sold by a direct sales force or by approved agencies (CMR&#x27;s). Available advertising space varies among publishers and ranges from bold names up to four color twin page ads (&quot;double trucks&quot;).

In the United States, the predominant yellow pages are DEX One&#x27;s DEX, the AT&amp;T Real Yellow Pages, Yellowbook, and the Superpages.

Business listings used for publication are obtained by several methods. Local phone companies that publish yellow pages directories rely on their own customer lists and include business listings that are provided by incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs).

Advertising in yellow pages directories requires payment in full prior to printing or may be billed monthly over the life of the contract, which is usually 12 months. Typically, sales representatives help customers to design their ads and provide a proof copy for review and approval.

Yellow pages&#x27; print usage is reported to be declining with both advertisers and shoppers increasingly turning to Internet search engines and online directories. According to a study by Knowledge Networks/SRI, in 2007, print yellow pages were referenced 13.4 billion times, while Internet yellow pages references increased to 3.8 billion, up from 2006&#x27;s 3.3 billion online searches. As a result, most yellow pages publishers have attempted to create online versions of their print directories. These online versions are referred to as IYP or Internet yellow pages. Independent ad agencies or Internet marketing consultants can assist business owners in determining sound opportunities for yellow pages advertising and provide objective information on usage, possession and preferences.

Archived yellow pages and telephone directories are important tools in local historical research and trademark litigation.

== Logo ==
The &quot;Walking Fingers&quot; logo was created by Henry Alexander, a New England artist. After graduating from the Swain School of Design in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Alexander began a freelance career as an illustrator and commercial designer. He formed a long association with the New England Telephone Company lasting thirty-one years. In 1962, he designed the &quot;walking fingers&quot; logo and within a year it became the national trademark for their yellow pages.

AT&amp;T, the creator and owner of the most famous three-fingered version of the &quot;Walking Fingers&quot; logo, never applied for a trademark on the logo. While they eventually received a trademark on a different version of the logo, the version with the three fingers was not considered by AT&amp;T to be proprietary and they in fact allowed any telephone directory to use it. Throughout the 1970s, many television ads showed a disembodied hand &quot;walking&quot; across an open copy of the Yellow Pages, with the slogan &quot;Let Your Fingers Do the Walking.&quot;

The Bell System later applied for a trademark on the logo but had its application denied on the grounds that it &quot;had become a generic indicator of the yellow pages without regard to any particular source.&quot; For a time in the late 1990s, the Yellow Pages Publishing Association began using a trademarkable logo with a lightbulb instead of the walking fingers (with the slogan &quot;Get an idea&quot;) as part of an ad campaign featuring Jon Lovitz, intended to portray the Yellow Pages as a consumer resource that would give customers ideas as opposed to simply being a telephone directory; the end of these ads showed the walking fingers reaching down and grabbing a lightbulb from within the pages beneath. The walking fingers logo returned two years later.

In some countries, the familiar &quot;walking fingers&quot; logo is not protected as a trademark and may be used by anyone. This logo is used in varying forms by almost every yellow pages publisher; however, there are companies that use it to imitate mainstream publishers.
In Belgium, the Republic of Ireland, Israel and the Netherlands the directory, although using the yellow pages logo, is called &quot;Golden Pages&quot;.

== Internet yellow pages ==
Online business directories are branded as IYP or Internet yellow pages. On a broader scale, they can be classified as vertical directories. There are consumer oriented and business oriented varieties. Providers of IYP offer online advertising.

According to several reports, the search term &quot;yellow pages&quot; was among the five highest revenue-generating search terms in Google&#x27;s AdWords program in 2010. Experian/Hitwise reported in January 2011 that the search term &quot;yellow pages&quot; was one of the top 50 search terms across all search engines and all search terms (millions of search terms). This made &quot;yellow pages&quot; one of the most searched-for things on the Internet in 2011.

The Yellow Pages Association said in February 2011 that 75 percent of adults in the United States still used print yellow pages and that for every $1 in investment, businesses returned $15.

IYP offers listings differently from standard search engines. Where search engines return results based on relevance to the true search term, IYP returns results based on a geographic area.

IYP is classified as a local search directory which provides content with the added ability to refine the search to find the needed service. The search engine prioritizes local businesses in its results rather than the results being dominated by regional or national companies. All services offer paid advertising options which typically offer preferred placement on search results pages.

== Environmental concerns ==
In later years, the yellow pages industry faced scrutiny from environmentalist groups who claim printed yellow pages are a wasteful resource, citing statistics that by 2011 nearly 70% of all Americans rarely or never used printed phone directories. In other results, approximately 58% of working U.S. adults said they used phone books at home, work, or both, according to a 2013 survey by RingCentral that appeared in USA Today.

The Product Stewardship Institute claims local governments spend $54 million a year to dispose of unwanted phone books and $9 million to recycle them. Phone books use low-grade glues and are therefore difficult to recycle, and they often clog recycling machinery. Conversely, publishers note that phone book directories are 100% recyclable and are made using soy-based and non-toxic inks, glues, and dyes.

In 2011, San Francisco became the first city in the United States to restrict yellow page distribution to people who opt in, but was being sued in federal court by the Local Search Association on freedom of speech grounds. According to the Sierra Club, 1.6 million phone books were distributed annually in San Francisco, producing 3,600 tons of waste, $1 million in disposal costs, and 6,180 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. In 2013, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed, and the Mayor signed, an ordinance that repealed the Yellow Pages Distribution Pilot Program (Ordinance 130186).

Also in 2011, the Yellow Pages Association and the Association of Directory Publishers started the yellowpagesoptout.com Web site allowing anyone in the United States to choose not to receive directories. The site remains active as of 2025.

The 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Municipal Solid Waste report classified directories as the smallest contributor of paper and paperboard products to the solid waste stream, representing only 0.3% – significantly less than all other paper product categories such as newspapers, magazines and books. In 2010, the EPA stopped measuring directories separately from newspapers, indicating the minor impact of directories on municipal waste.

Yellow Pages publishers&#x27; paper usage declined by nearly 60% between 2007–2012, and were projected to continue declining through 2013, according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council. The EPA&#x27;s 2011 Municipal Waste report showed that approximately 73% of phone directory, newspaper, and mechanical papers were recycled.

== Decline of print directories ==
In September 2017, Yell, the publisher of Yellow Pages in the United Kingdom, announced that the business would be fully digitized from January 2019, ending the publication&#x27;s 51-year run. The last UK copies were posted out on 18 January 2019.

The Irish publisher of the Golden Pages moved to an online-only model in 2017 after exiting examinership. The equivalent &quot;Independent Directory&quot; (similar to the UK&#x27;s Thomson Local directories) produced by Independent News &amp; Media ceased publication in 2009.

<doc id="642751" wikidata="Q310898" url="?curid=642751" title="Li Yu (1611–1680)">
<text>Li Yu (, given name: 仙侣 Xiānlǚ; courtesy name: 笠翁 Lìwēng; 1611–1680 AD), also known as Li Liweng, was a Chinese playwright, novelist and publisher.

==Life and writings==
Born in Rugao, in present-day Jiangsu province, he lived in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Although he passed the first stage of the imperial examination, he failed to pass higher levels before the political turmoil of the new dynasty, but instead turned to writing for the market. Li was an actor, producer, and director as well as a playwright, who traveled with his own troupe. His play &quot;Errors caused by the Kite&quot; () is performed in the Chinese Kun opera stage.

Li is the presumed author of &quot;The Carnal Prayer Mat&quot;, a comedy of Chinese erotic literature. He also wrote a book of short stories called &quot;Twelve Towers&quot; (). He addresses the topic of same-sex love in the tale &quot;House of Gathered Refinements&quot; (). This is a theme he revisits in the collection &quot;Silent Operas&quot; (i.e. &quot;novels&quot;; ) and his play &quot;The Fragrant Companion&quot;. Li prefaced and published the painting manual &quot;Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden&quot; in Jinling.

Li was also known for his informal essays, or &quot;xiaopin&quot; (), and for his gastronomy and gastronomical writings. Lin Yutang translated a number of these essays. Li&#x27;s &quot;On Having a Stomach&quot; proposes that the mouth and the stomach &quot;cause all the worry and trouble of mankind throughout the ages.&quot; He continues that the &quot;plants can live without a mouth and a stomach, and the rocks and the soil have their being without any nourishment. Why, then, must we be given a mouth and a stomach and endowed with these two extra organs?&quot; Lin also translated Li&#x27;s &quot;How to be Happy Though Rich&quot; and &quot;How to be Happy Though Poor&quot;, and &quot;The Arts of Sleeping, Walking, Sitting and Standing&quot;, which illustrate his satirical approach to serious topics.

Li was critical of gambling, describing dice as innocent objects transformed into devils in the hands of gamblers.

<doc id="642752" wikidata="Q2849275" url="?curid=642752" title="Mangala">
<text>Mangala (Sanskrit: मङ्गल, IAST: ) is the personification, as well as the name for the planet Mars, in Hindu literature. Also known as Lohita (), he is the deity of anger, aggression, as well as war. According to Vaishnavism, he is the son of Bhumi, the earth goddess, and Vishnu, born when the latter raised her from the depths of the primordial waters in his Varaha avatar. According to Shaivism, he was born from the god Shiva through a drop of his blood or sweat.

== Nomenclature ==
Mars (Mangala) is also called:
* Raktavarna (रक्तवर्ण) - whose color is like blood. 
* Bhauma (भौम) - son of Bhumi.
* Lohitānga (लोहिताङ्ग) - red bodied (Loha also means Iron, so could also mean Iron Bodied).
* Kuja (कुज) - he who is born from Earth.
* Bha (भ) - shining.
* Dharāputra (धरापुत्र) - son of Dharā.

==Iconography==
He is painted red or flame colour, four-armed, carrying a trident (Sanskrit: &quot;trishūla&quot;), mace (Sanskrit: &quot;gadā&quot;), lotus (Sanskrit: &quot;Padma&quot;), and a spear (Sanskrit: &quot;shūla).&quot; His mount (Sanskrit: &quot;vahana&quot;) is a ram. He presides over Tuesday.

== Legend ==

Mangala appears in the narrative of the Varaha avatar of Vishnu. When the king of the asuras, Hiranyaksha, abducts the goddess of the earth, Bhumi, Vishnu assumes his third avatar, and descends upon the earth to rescue her. Observing that the asura had dragged her deep within the primordial waters, he catches the goddess with his tusks, and successfully slays the asura, restoring her to her rightful place in the cosmos. As she rises, Vishnu realises that Bhumi is, in fact, an aspect of his consort, Lakshmi, and proceeds to sport with her, and from this union is born Mangala, meaning the auspicious one. 

According to Shaivism, once when Shiva was engrossed in meditation on Mount Kailash, three drops of perspiration from his forehead fell on Earth. From those drops was born a beautiful infant with a reddish complexion and four arms. Shiva handed the child to Mother Earth for upbringing. Brought up by Bhumi, the child was named Bhauma.

==Literature==

The word &quot;Mangala&quot; is ancient, first appearing in the Rigveda (2nd millennium BCE), and mentioned by grammarian Patanjali (~2nd century BCE), but not as an astrological term, rather to mean &quot;auspicious-successful&quot; (&quot;siddha&quot;) structure in literary arts. Panini too mentions it in verse I.3.1 in a similar context. In the Vedic texts, states Christopher Minkowski, there is no mention of auspicious rituals, or auspicious start or timing of a ritual, rather the &quot;mangala&quot; as auspicious practices likely emerged in the Indian traditions during the medieval era (after mid 1st millennium CE), thereafter found in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The ritualistic Mimamsa school of Hinduism did not include any &quot;mangala&quot; (auspicious) verses, related to plane &quot;Mangala&quot; in any of its text throughout the 1st millennium CE.

The Markandeya Purana contains the astrological &quot;Mangala Kavacha Stotram&quot;, which includes a prayer to be recited to Mangala for seeking protection.

==Astrology and worship==

Jyotisha, the tradition of Hindu astrology, includes Mangala in the concept of Nakshatra (see also List of Nakshathra temples), Navagraha (see also List of Navagraha temples), and Saptarishi. He is included in the list of Hindu deities, whose dedicated temples are found at various Hindu pilgrimage sites, to which Hindus perform their pilgrimage, called yatra.

==Planet==
Mangala, as a planet, appears in various Hindu astronomical texts in Sanskrit, such as the 5th century &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; by Aryabhata, the 6th century &quot;Romaka&quot; by Latadeva and &quot;Panca Siddhantika&quot; by Varahamihira, the 7th century &quot;Khandakhadyaka&quot; by Brahmagupta and the 8th century &quot;Sisyadhivrddida&quot; by Lalla. These texts present Mangala as one of the planets and estimate the characteristics of the respective planetary motion. Other texts such as &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; dated to have been complete sometime between the 5th century and 10th century present their chapters on various planets with deity mythologies.

The manuscripts of these texts exist in slightly different versions, present Mangala&#x27;s motion in the skies, but vary in their data, suggesting that the text were open and revised over their lives.

The 1st millennium CE Hindu scholars had estimated the time it took for sidereal revolutions of each planet including Mangala, from their astronomical studies, with slightly different results:

==Calendar and zodiac==
Mangala is the root of the word &#x27;Mangalavara&#x27; or Tuesday in the Hindu calendar. The word also means &quot;auspicious&quot; but the planet is considered malefic.

Similarly, the names of Tuesday in other Indo-European languages are often derived from the Roman god Mars, (such as the Latin word &quot;Martis&quot; &quot;Tuesday&quot;) or a god ascribed with similar characteristics. The root of the English word Tuesday, for instance, is the old Germanic god of war and victory, Tīw, also known as Týr.

Mangala is part of the Navagraha in Hindu zodiac system. The role and importance of the Navagraha developed over time with various influences. The earliest work of astrology recorded in India is the Vedanga Jyotisha which began to be compiled in the 14th century BCE.

Deifying planetary bodies and their astrological significance occurred as early as the Vedic period and was recorded in the Vedas. The classical planets, including Mars, were referenced in the Atharvaveda from the second millennium BCE. The Navagraha was furthered by additional contributions from Western Asia, including Zoroastrian and Hellenistic influences. The Yavanajataka, or &#x27;Science of the Yavanas&#x27;, was written by the Indo-Greek named &quot;Yavanesvara&quot; (&quot;Lord of the Greeks&quot;) under the rule of the Western Kshatrapa king Rudrakarman I. The Yavanajataka written in 120 CE is often attributed to standardizing Indian astrology. The Navagraha would further develop and culminate in the Shaka era with the Saka, or Scythian, people. Additionally the contributions by the Saka people would be the basis of the Indian national calendar, which is also called the Saka calendar.

<text>Wojciech Korfanty (; born Adalbert Korfanty; 20 April 1873 – 17 August 1939) was a Polish activist, journalist and politician, who served as a member of the German parliaments, the Reichstag and the Prussian Landtag, and later, in the Polish &quot;Sejm&quot;. Briefly, he also was a paramilitary leader, known for organizing the Polish Silesian Uprisings in Upper Silesia, which after World War I was contested by Germany and Poland. Korfanty fought to protect Poles from discrimination and the policies of Germanisation in Upper Silesia before the war and sought to join Silesia to Poland after Poland regained its independence.

==Early life==
He was born the son of a coal miner in Sadzawka, part of Siemianowice (at the time &quot;Laurahütte&quot;), in Prussian Silesia, then part of the German Empire. From 1895 until 1901, he studied philosophy, law, and economics, first at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (Berlin) (1895) and then at the University of Breslau, where the Marxist Werner Sombart was among his teachers. Korfanty and Sombart remained friends for many years.

In 1901, Korfanty became editor-in-chief of the Polish language paper &quot;Górnoslązak&quot; (&quot;The Upper Silesian&quot;), in which he appealed to the national consciousness of the region&#x27;s Polish-speaking population.

In 1903, Korfanty was elected to the German Reichstag and in 1904 also to the Prussian Landtag, where he represented the independent &quot;Polish circle&quot; (&quot;Polskie koło&quot;). That was a significant departure from tradition, as the Polish minority in Germany had so far predominantly supported the conservative Centre Party, which represented the large Catholic community in Germany, which felt inferior in the Protestant-dominated Reich. However, when it refused to advocate Polish minority rights (beyond the Poles&#x27; rights as Catholics), the Poles distanced themselves from it, seeking protection elsewhere. In a paper entitled &quot;Precz z Centrum&quot; (&quot;Away with the Centre Party&quot;, 1901), Korfanty urged the Catholic Polish-speaking minority in Germany to overcome their national indifference and shift their political allegiance from supra-national Catholicism to the cause of the Polish nation. However, Korfanty retained his Christian Democratic convictions and later returned to them in domestic Polish politics.

==Polish restoration==
During World War I, in 1916, a Kingdom of Poland was proclaimed by the German and the Austro-Hungarian Empires, which was then replaced by an independent Polish state in 1918. In a &quot;Reichstag&quot; speech on 25 October 1918, Korfanty demanded that the provinces of West Prussia (including Ermeland (Warmia)) and the city of Danzig (Gdańsk), the Province of Posen, and parts of the provinces of East Prussia (Masuria) and Silesia (Upper Silesia) to be included in the Polish state.

After the war, during the Great Poland Uprising, Korfanty became a member of the &quot;Naczelna Rada Ludowa&quot; (Supreme People&#x27;s Council) in Poznań and a member of the Polish provisional parliament, the &quot;Constituanta-Sejm&quot;. He was also the head of the Polish plebiscite committee in Upper Silesia. He was one of the leaders of the Second Silesian Uprising in 1920 and the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921, which were Polish insurrections against German rule in Upper Silesia. The German authorities were forced to leave their positions by the League of Nations. Poland was allotted by the League of Nations roughly half of the population and valuable mining districts, which were eventually attached to Poland. Korfanty was accused by Germans of organizing terrorism against German civilians of Upper Silesia. German propaganda newspapers also &quot;smeared&quot; him with ordering the murder of Silesian politician Theofil Kupka.

==Polish politics==
Korfanty was a member of the national &quot;Sejm&quot; from 1922 to 1930 and in the Silesian Sejm (1922–1935), where he represented a Christian Democratic viewpoint. He opposed the autonomy of the Silesian Voivodship, which he saw as an obstacle against its reintegration into Poland. However, he defended the rights of the German minority in Upper Silesia because he believed that the prosperity of minorities enriched the whole society of a region.

He briefly acted as vice-premier in the government of Wincenty Witos (October–December 1923). From 1924, he resumed his journalist activities as editor-in-chief of the papers &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; (&quot;The Republic&quot;, not to be confused with the modern newspaper of the same name) and &quot;Polonia&quot;. He opposed the May Coup of Józef Piłsudski and the subsequent establishment of &quot;Sanacja&quot;. In 1930, Korfanty was arrested and imprisoned in the Brest-Litovsk fortress, together with other leaders of the &quot;Centrolew&quot;, an alliance of left-wing and centrist parties in opposition to the ruling government.

==Exile==
In 1935, he was forced to leave Poland and emigrated to Czechoslovakia, from where he participated in the centre-right Morges Front group, founded by émigrés Ignacy Paderewski and Władysław Sikorski. After the German invasion of Czechoslovakia, Korfanty moved on to France. He returned to Poland in the April 1939, after Nazi Germany had cancelled the Polish-German non-aggression pact of 1934, hoping that the renewed threat to Polish independence would help overcome the domestic political cleavage. He was arrested immediately upon arrival. In August, he was released as unfit for prison because of his bad health and died shortly afterwards, two weeks before World War II began with the German invasion of Poland. Although the cause of death remains unclear, it has been claimed that the treatment he received in prison may have caused his health to deteriorate.

==Legacy==
After 1945, when the Polish communists sought legitimisation as the champions and guarantors of Polish independence, Korfanty was finally rehabilitated as a national hero for his fight to protect the Polish population in Upper Silesia from discrimination and for his efforts to join the Polish population in Silesia to Poland.

Today, many streets, places and institutions are named after him. When Opole Silesia became part of Poland in 1945, the town of Friedland in Oberschlesien, in German Upper Silesia, was renamed Korfantów in his honour.

<doc id="642755" wikidata="Q768510" url="?curid=642755" title="Reduviidae">
<text>The Reduviidae is a large cosmopolitan family of the suborder Heteroptera of the order Hemiptera (true bugs). Among the Hemiptera and together with the Nabidae almost all species are terrestrial ambush predators; most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic. The main examples of non-predatory Reduviidae are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae, with a few species from South America noted for their ability to transmit Chagas disease. Though spectacular exceptions are known, most members of the family are fairly easily recognizable: they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build, and formidable curved proboscis (sometimes called a rostrum). Large specimens should be handled with caution, if at all, because they sometimes defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis.

==Taxonomy==
The family members are almost all predatory, except for a few blood-sucking species, some of which are important as disease vectors. About 7000 species have been described, in more than 20 recognized subfamilies, making it one of the largest families in the Hemiptera.

The name Reduviidae is derived from the type genus, &quot;Reduvius&quot;. That name, in turn, comes from the Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;hangnail&quot; or &quot;remnant&quot;. Possibly this name was inspired by the lateral flanges on the abdomen of many species.

Common genera include:

* &quot;Lopodytes&quot;
* &quot;Melanolestes&quot;
* &quot;Platymeris&quot;
* &quot;Pselliopus&quot;
* &quot;Psyttala&quot;
* &quot;Rasahus&quot;
* &quot;Reduvius&quot;
* &quot;Rhiginia&quot;
* &quot;Sinea&quot;
* &quot;Zelus&quot;

While members of most subfamilies have no common names other than assassin bugs, some subfamilies have their own common names such as:
* Ambush bugs – subfamily Phymatinae
* Thread-legged bugs – subfamily Emesinae, including the genus &quot;Emesaya&quot;
* Kissing bugs (or cone-headed bugs) – subfamily Triatominae, unusual in that most species are blood-suckers and several are important disease vectors
* Wheel bugs – genus &quot;Arilus&quot;, including the common North American species &quot;Arilus cristatus&quot;
* Grass assassin bugs – genus &quot;Lopodytes&quot;

==Morphology==


Adult insects range from roughly , depending on the species. They most commonly have an elongated head with a distinct narrowed &#x27;neck&#x27;, long legs, and prominent, segmented, tubular mouthparts, most commonly called the proboscis, but some authors use the term &quot;rostrum&quot;. Most species are bright in colour with hues of brown, black, red, or orange.

The most distinctive feature of the family is that the tip of the proboscis fits into a ridged groove in the prosternum, where it can be used to produce sound by stridulation. Sound is made by rasping the proboscis against ridges in this groove or stridulitrum (stridulatory organ). These sounds are often used to discourage predators. When harassed, many species can deliver a painful stab with the proboscis, injecting venom or digestive juices. The effects can be intensely painful and the injection from some species may be medically significant.

==Feeding==


Predatory Reduviidae use the long rostrum to inject a lethal saliva that liquefies the insides of the prey, which are then sucked out. The saliva contains enzymes that digest the tissues they swallow. This process is generally referred to as extraoral digestion. The saliva is commonly effective at killing prey substantially larger than the bug itself.

The legs of some Reduviidae have areas covered in tiny hairs that aid in holding onto their prey while they feed. Others, members of the subfamily Phymatinae in particular, have forelegs that resemble those of the praying mantis, and they catch and hold their prey in a similar way to mantises.

As nymphs, some species cover and camouflage themselves effectively with debris or the remains of dead prey insects. The nymphal instars of the species &quot;Acanthaspis pedestris&quot; present one good example of this behaviour where they occur in Tamil Nadu in India. Another well-known species is &quot;Reduvius personatus&quot;, known as the masked hunter because of its habit of camouflaging itself with dust. Some species tend to feed on pests such as cockroaches or bedbugs and are accordingly popular in regions where people regard their hunting as beneficial. &quot;Reduvius personatus&quot; is an example, and some people breed them as pets and for pest control. Some assassin bug subfamilies are adapted to hunting certain types of prey; for example, the Ectrichodiinae eat millipedes, and feather-legged bugs eat ants. A spectacular example of the latter is &quot;Ptilocnemus lemur&quot;, an Australian species in which the adult attacks and eats ants, but the nymph waits until the ant bites the feathery tufts on its hind legs, upon which it whips around and pierces the ant&#x27;s head with its proboscis, and proceeds to feed.

Some research on the nature of the venom from certain Reduviidae is under way. The saliva of &quot;Rhynocoris marginatus&quot; showed some insecticidal activity &quot;in vitro&quot;, in tests on lepidopteran pests. The effects included reduction of food consumption, assimilation, and use. Its antiaggregation factors also affected the aggregation and mobility of haemocytes.

The saliva of the species &quot;Rhynocoris marginatus&quot; (Fab.) and &quot;Catamirus brevipennis&quot; (Servile) have been studied because of their activity against human pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria (including strains of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Proteus vulgaris&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot;) and the Gram-positive (&quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;).

Some species are bloodsuckers rather than predators, and they are accordingly far less welcome to humans. The blood-feeding habit is thought to have evolved from species that lived in the nests of mammalian hosts. Several species are known to live among bat roosts, including &quot;Cavernicola pilosa&quot;, &quot;Triatoma dimidiata&quot; and &quot;Eratyrus mucronatus&quot;. &quot;Triatoma&quot; species and other members of the subfamily Triatominae, such as &quot;Rhodnius&quot; species, &quot;Panstrongylus megistus&quot;, and &quot;Paratriatoma hirsuta&quot;, are known as kissing bugs, because they tend to bite sleeping humans in the soft tissue around the lips and eyes. A more serious problem than their bites is the fact that several of these haematophagous Central and South American species transmit the potentially fatal trypanosomal Chagas disease, sometimes called American trypanosomiasis. This results in the death of 12,000 people a year.

The Emesinae live among spider webs.

==Phylogeny and evolutionary history==

Current taxonomy is based on morphological characteristics. The first cladistic analysis based on molecular data (mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal DNA) was published in 2009 and called into question the monophyly of some current groups, such as the Emesinae. Reduviidae are monophyletic, and the &quot;Phymatine Complex&quot; is consistently recovered as the sister to the higher Reduviidae, which includes 90 percent of the reduviid species diversity. Reduviidae is suggested to have split from other Cimicomorphs during the Jurassic, based on molecular clock. The oldest fossils of the family are from the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) aged Burmese amber, represented by nymphs and the genus &quot;Paleotriatoma,&quot; belonging to the subfamily Triatominae.

<text>Sleepy Hollow Cemetery is a rural cemetery located on Bedford Street near the center of Concord, Massachusetts. The cemetery is the burial site of a number of famous Concordians, including some of the United States&#x27; greatest authors and thinkers, especially on a hill known as &quot;Author&#x27;s Ridge.&quot;

==History==
 Sleepy Hollow was designed in 1855 by noted landscape architects Cleveland and Copeland, and has been in use ever since. It was dedicated on September 29, 1855; Ralph Waldo Emerson gave a dedication speech and would be buried there decades later. Both designers of the cemetery had decades-long friendships with many leaders of the Transcendentalism movement and is reflected in their design.

&quot;Sleepy Hollow was an early natural garden designed in keeping with Emerson&#x27;s aesthetic principles,&quot; writes Joachim Wolschke-Bulmahn in his &quot;Nature and Ideology&quot;. In 1855, landscape designer Robert Morris Copeland delivered an address he entitled &quot;The Usefull [sic] and The Beautiful&quot;, tying his principles of naturalistic, organic garden design to Emerson&#x27;s Transcendentalist principles. Shortly afterward, Copeland and his partner were retained by the Concord Cemetery Committee, of which Emerson was an active member, to design a cemetery for the growing community.

On September 29, 1855, Emerson delivered the opening address of the cemetery&#x27;s consecration. In it he lauded the designers&#x27; work. &quot;The garden of the living,&quot; said Emerson, was as much for the benefit for the living, to communicate their relationship to the natural world, as it was to honor the dead. By situating the monuments to the dead within a natural landscape, the architects conveyed their message, said Emerson. A cemetery could not &quot;jealously guard a few atoms under immense marbles, selfishly and impossibly sequestering [them] from the vast circulations of nature [which] recompenses for new life [each decomposing] particle.&quot;

Known as Sleepy Hollow for some 20 years prior to its use as a cemetery, Emerson told his audience at the consecration ceremony that September day in Concord, &quot;When these acorns, that are falling at our feet, are oaks overshadowing our children in a remote century, this mute green bank will be full of history: the good, the wise, and the great will have left their names and virtues on the trees... will have made the air tuneable and articulate.&quot;

To realize their vision, Emerson noted that the cemetery&#x27;s designers had fitted the walks and drives into the site&#x27;s natural amphitheater. They also left much of the original natural vegetation in place, instead of removing it and replanting with ornamental shrubs, as was often the case. Several years after Emerson&#x27;s address, a visitor to the new cemetery noted the abundance of wild plants such as woodbine, raspberry, and goldenrod, as well as the natural moss and roots of pine trees which were left in situ by the designers.

The Melvin Memorial, also known as Mourning Victory, sculpted by Daniel Chester French marks the grave of three brothers killed in the Civil War. 

Several notable literary figures are buried on &quot;Author&#x27;s Ridge&quot;.

People are still being buried in Sleepy Hollow. The back of the newer portion of the cemetery leads to a path system which connects to the Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge.

<text>Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge—Mission (formerly Dewdney—Alouette) was a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2015.

==Demographics==
==Geography==
The district includes the northwestern quarter of the Fraser Valley Regional District (which includes Mission, Kent, Nicomen Island, and Lake Erock), and the District Municipalities of Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows and their vicinities.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1996 as &quot;Dewdney—Alouette&quot; riding from parts of Fraser Valley East and Mission—Coquitlam ridings. Its name was changed in 2004 to &quot;Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge—Mission&quot; in 2004.

The 2012 electoral redistribution saw this riding split into Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge and Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon for the 2015 election, the former Conservative MP Randy Kemp retired, with the Liberal Party picking up both new ridings.

<doc id="642769" wikidata="Q2870012" url="?curid=642769" title="Warrington bombings">
<text>The Warrington bombings were two bomb attacks that took place during early 1993 in Warrington, Cheshire, England. The first attack happened on 26 February, when a bomb exploded at a gas storage facility. This first explosion caused extensive damage, but no injuries. While fleeing the scene, the bombers shot and injured a police officer and two of the bombers were caught after a high-speed car chase. The second attack happened on 20 March, when two smaller bombs exploded in litter bins outside shops and businesses on Bridge Street. Two children were killed and 56 people were injured.

The attacks were carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). From the early 1970s, the IRA had been carrying out attacks in both Northern Ireland and England with the stated goal of putting pressure on the UK Government to withdraw from Northern Ireland. 

==First attack==

On the night of 25 February 1993, three IRA members planted Semtex bombs at the gas holders on Winwick Road, Warrington. At 11:45pm that night, a police officer stopped the three men in a van on Sankey Street. As he was questioning them, the IRA members shot him three times and sped off in the van. About an hour later, they hijacked a car in Lymm, put the driver in the boot and drove off towards Manchester. At about 1am, police spotted the car and chased it along the M62 motorway in the direction of Warrington. Shots were fired during the high-speed chase and two police vehicles were hit. Police stopped the car on the motorway near Croft and arrested two of the IRA members: Páidric MacFhloinn (age 40) and Denis Kinsella (age 25). The third member, Michael Timmins, escaped. At 4:10am on 26 February, the bombs exploded at the gas holders, sending a fireball into the sky and causing extensive damage to the facility. The emergency services arrived and evacuated about 100 people from their homes. There was much disruption to transport that morning as police set up roadblocks and trains were diverted away from Warrington.

In 1994, MacFhloinn was sentenced to 35 years in prison and Kinsella to 25 years for their part in the bombing. John Kinsella (age 49) was sentenced to 20 years for possessing Semtex explosives that he had hidden for the IRA unit. These explosives were previously supplied by Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

==Second attack==
Shortly before midday on Saturday, 20 March 1993, The Samaritans in Liverpool received a bomb warning by telephone. According to police, the caller said only that a bomb had been planted outside a Boots shop. Merseyside Police sent officers to branches of Boots in Liverpool and warned the Cheshire Constabulary, who patrolled nearby Warrington. About 30 minutes later, at about 12:25, two bombs exploded on Bridge Street in Warrington, about apart. The blasts happened within a minute of each other. One exploded outside Boots and McDonald&#x27;s, and one outside the Argos catalogue store. The area was crowded with shoppers. Witnesses said that shoppers fled from the first explosion into the path of the second. It was later found that the bombs had been placed inside cast-iron litter bins, causing large amounts of shrapnel. Buses were organised to ferry people away from the scene and 20 paramedics and crews from 17 ambulances were sent to deal with the aftermath.

Three-year-old Johnathan Ball died at the scene. He had been in town with his babysitter, shopping for a Mother&#x27;s Day card. The second victim, 12-year-old Tim Parry, was gravely wounded. He died on 25 March 1993 when his life support machine was switched off, after tests had found only minimal brain activity. Another 54 people were injured, four of them seriously. One of the survivors, 32-year-old Bronwen Vickers, the mother of two young daughters, had to have a leg amputated, and died just over a year later from cancer.

The Provisional IRA issued a statement the day after the bombing, acknowledging its involvement but saying:Responsibility for the tragic and deeply regrettable death and injuries caused in Warrington yesterday lies squarely at the door of those in the British authorities who deliberately failed to act on precise and adequate warnings. A day later, an IRA spokesman said that &quot;two precise warnings&quot; had been given &quot;in adequate time&quot;, one to the Samaritans and one to Merseyside Police. He added: &quot;You don&#x27;t provide warnings if it is your intention to kill&quot;. Cheshire&#x27;s assistant chief constable denied there had been a second warning and said: Yes, a warning was given half-an-hour before, but no mention was made of Warrington. If the IRA think they can pass on their responsibility for this terrible act by issuing such a nonsensical statement, they have sadly underestimated the understanding of the British public.

A piece on BBC North West&#x27;s &quot;Inside Out&quot; programme in September 2013 speculated that the bombing may have been the work of a &quot;rogue&quot; IRA unit, which was supported by the IRA but operated independently and who used operatives who were from England to avoid suspicion. The programme also examined a possible link between the attack and British leftist political group Red Action, though nothing was ever proven.

==Aftermath==
The deaths of two young children ensured that the 20 March bombings received major coverage in the media and caused widespread public anger. Shortly after the bombings, a group called &quot;Peace &#x27;93&quot; was set up in Dublin. The main organiser was Susan McHugh, a Dublin housewife and mother. On 25 March 1993, thousands held a peace rally in Dublin. They signed a condolence book outside the General Post Office and laid bouquets and wreaths, with messages of sorrow and apology, to be taken to Warrington for the boys&#x27; funerals. Some criticised Peace &#x27;93 for focusing only on IRA violence and for not responding to the deaths of children in Northern Ireland.

On 1 April 1993, the Irish Government announced measures designed to make extradition easier from the Republic of Ireland to the United Kingdom.

On 19 September 1994, Irish rock band The Cranberries released the song &quot;Zombie&quot;, which was written in protest at the bombings. The song went on to become their biggest hit.

On 14 November 1996, the Duchess of Kent officially inaugurated a memorial called The River of Life, depicting &quot;a symbol of hope for future generations&quot;, in Bridge Street. It was developed in the aftermath of the bomb attack and commissioned by the Warrington Borough Council. The project, consisting of a symbolic water sculpture that features a commemorative plaque, was designed by local primary school pupils and Stephen Broadbent.

The parents of Tim Parry set up the Tim Parry Trust Fund to promote greater understanding between Great Britain and Ireland. The Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace worked jointly with the NSPCC to develop The Peace Centre, close to Warrington town centre, which opened on the seventh anniversary of the attack in 2000. Its purpose is to promote peace and understanding amongst all communities affected by conflict and violence. The centre hosts an annual peace lecture, as well as being home to the local NSPCC and was the home of Warrington Youth Club until 2022.

The bombings received further attention in 2019 after the Brexit Party selected former &quot;Living Marxism&quot; writer Claire Fox as their lead candidate in the North West for the 2019 European Parliament election; the Revolutionary Communist Party, of which Fox was a leading member in 1993, defended the IRA&#x27;s bombing in their party newsletter. Despite the controversy, which saw another Brexit Party candidate resign from the party list in protest at the comments, Fox and the Brexit Party topped the poll in several areas of the North West, including in Warrington.

The killing of Ball and Parry is still on Cheshire Police&#x27;s list of unsolved murders.

==Made for television film==
The events around the second bombing, with the killing of two children, and the efforts of the parents of Tim Parry and &quot;Peace &#x27;93&quot; and McHugh, were dramatised in the 2018 television film, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;, starring Vicky McClure, Daniel Mays, and Anna Maxwell Martin.

<text>The Staten Island Zoo is an urban zoo in West New Brighton, Staten Island, New York City. The zoo is open year-round except on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year&#x27;s Day. It has been accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) since 1988.

==History==

The history of the Staten Island Zoo (Barrett Park) can be traced back to three Staten Island War heroes: Colonel Edward Harden, Colonel Richard Penn Smith, and Major Clarence Barrett. In the 1800s, Staten Island was home to many ranking military leaders including Colonel Harden and Colonel Penn Smith whose estates were located right across from each other on opposite sides of Clove Road.

The Staten Island Zoo was built on the former estate grounds of Colonel Edward Harden. Colonel Harden fought in the Spanish–American War and moved to 614 Broadway on Staten Island in 1908 with his wife Julia Harden where they resided in what was later known as the &quot;Harden Mansion&quot;. Julia Harden willed the land to the city upon her death under three conditions: that it be named for her brother-in-law, Civil War Major Clarence Barrett, that the property not be used for a playground, and that her husband Colonel Harden be allowed to reside in the house that stood on the property. Julia Harden died in 1930 and the property was transferred to the city of New York. The site was (and still is) officially called &quot;Barret Park&quot; in city planning records and it wasn&#x27;t until the 1960s when the &quot;Staten Island Zoo&quot; became the popular name for the site. In the first few years, the only mention of &quot;Zoo&quot; in the Zoo signs were in the word &quot;Zoological&quot; for the &quot;Staten Island Zoological Society&quot; which operated Barret Park.
In August 1933, the Staten Island Zoological Society was created and the park built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. On March 25, 1935, the Egbert-Robillard Bill was passed by the New York State Senate to have the city provide maintenance for the zoo. Two months later on May 7, 1935, the Governor of New York signed an agreement to allocate public funds for the zoo to cover operational and maintenance costs while the exhibits, animal care and educational programs were to be maintained by the Staten Island Zoological Society With the land now owned by the city and a Zoological Society in place to run and administer the site, zoo construction commenced in 1933 as part of the Federal Government&#x27;s works program to convert the 8-acre estate into a zoo. The zoo opened to the public on June 10, 1936, and was considered the first U.S. &quot;educational zoo&quot;.

From 1942 to 1966, Patricia O&#x27;Connor served as the chief animal caretaker at the zoo. She was reported to be &quot;the only woman veterinarian in any zoo in the country.&quot; 

In 1949 the zoo boasted a collection of over 1,200 animals, a 400-seat auditorium, and greeted 500,000 visitors per year. The zoo was reported to be &quot;spotless, modern, and odorless.&quot;

The parking lot which was built in 1968 and was built on a plot of land across from the zoo on the corner of Clove Road and Martling Avenue, The property was originally the mansion of United States Civil War Colonel Richard Penn Smith who fought at the Battle of Gettysburg. The war hero resided in Staten Island and is buried in Staten Island&#x27;s Moravian Cemetery on Richmond Road. Smith&#x27;s large stately home and surrounding plot of land was later purchased by the Actors Fund which turned the home into a retreat for actors with 50 bedrooms and views of Martling Pond. In the late 1920s, the retreat was closed and the 20 acres of the estate were eventually acquired and split between the Staten Island Zoological Society for use as a parking lot and by the Saint Peter&#x27;s Cemetery for expansion of burial sites.

In 1971 several animals at the zoo died from what later was found to be Lead poisoning. A Black Leopard named Mr Leo Pard suffered severe nerve damage due to lead poisoning. It was later found that the source of the Lead was from Tetraethyllead an additive in Gasoline. This incident contributed to the phaseout and ban of leaded gasoline in the United States.

==Staten Island Zoological Society==

Unlike all the other zoos in New York City, which are operated by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), the Staten Island Zoo is operated by the Staten Island Zoological Society which was created in August 1933 under the organization of Harold O&#x27;Connel. Local legend maintains that the society was partially formed from the Staten Island Reptile Club which was located nearby on Britton Street and Broadway. Although no written documentation exists regarding the merger it would explain the newly formed Staten Island Zoological Society&#x27;s affinity for reptiles and why the zoo was (and still is) known for its extensive reptile collection. Just short of one year after its organization on July 24, 1934, the Staten Island Zoological Society was officially incorporated. The Society included Harold O&#x27;Connel, Ellsworth Buck, Dr. James Chapin, George Allison, and Howard Worzel.

The Staten Island Zoological Society created the Zoo with the founding principle that it be an educational zoo. The Society held monthly evening lectures at the zoo, provided lessons at local schools, and provided zoo tours for school children. The zoo later expanded its education program under the zoo veterinarian, Dr. Patricia O&#x27;Conner, to include educational programs for hospital children and educational courses at the zoo for high school teachers and lectures for educators and local animal and wildlife clubs. The Staten Island Zoo still continues providing on-site and in-school lessons and special educational programs at the zoo. With a fully operational on-site veterinary clinic, the zoo has an extensive internship program for college students studying to become veterinary technicians and veterinarians. A small lecture auditorium was built in the basement level of the zoo building and a classroom and a private library are located on the second floor of the zoo building along with the administrative offices of the Zoological Society.

==Animals ==
Initially, the focus of the zoo was reptiles, in particular including the collection of snakes housed in the zoo&#x27;s Serpentarium. Although the focus of the zoo has broadened, the zoo&#x27;s collection of rattlesnakes is still regarded as among the largest and most complete in North America. The current collection comprises over 1,500 animals of over 350 different species. Among the zoo&#x27;s current exhibits is the African Savannah at Twilight.

Many of the animals were obtained through purchases and through procurements from other zoological parks. From the 1930s to the early 1960s, animals were also acquired through annual expeditions by zoological staff such as the collection trip in 1936 by curator Carl Kauffeld for rattlesnakes and a later 1965 trip by zookeeper Bob Zappalorti and through donations such as a pair of Solenodons which were donated by the Dominican Republic&#x27;s Rafael Trujillo. The Collection of Marine fish was donated by the Staten Island Aquarium Society in the late 1950s.

A The New York Times article in 1944 reported that there were &quot;over 600&quot; animals at the zoo, including a binturong, an ocelot, a spider monkey, a herring gull, as well as an African leopard named Tommy. 

In 1949 the &quot;Times&quot; reported that the zoo held over 1,200 animals, including a concave-casqued hornbill, a white pelican, a Pel&#x27;s fishing owl, a black mangabey ape, a pair of Guatemalan quetzal birds, a regal python, and &quot;perhaps the only bushmaster snake in the country.&quot;

The zoo is also the home of Staten Island Chuck, a groundhog who is the official Groundhog Day forecaster for New York City, and Grandpa, a Black-handed Spider Monkey who made local newspapers when he accurately &quot;predicted&quot; the outcome of six out of nine matches during the U.S. Open Tennis Championship.

* Groundhog
* Chinese alligator

<text>Prehistoric archaeology is a subfield of archaeology, which deals specifically with artefacts, civilisations and other materials from societies that existed before any form of writing system or historical record. Often the field focuses on ages such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age, although it also encompasses periods such as the Neolithic. The study of prehistoric archaeology reflects the cultural concerns of modern society by showing interpretations of time between economic growth and political stability. It is related to other disciplines such as geology, biology, anthropology, historiography and palaeontology, although there are noticeable differences between the subjects they all broadly study to understand; the past, either organic or inorganic or the lives of humans. Prehistoric archaeology is also sometimes termed as anthropological archaeology because of its indirect traces with complex patterns.

Due to the unique nature of prehistoric archaeology, in that written records can not be drawn upon to aid the study of the societies it focuses on, the subject matter investigated is entirely material remains as they are the only traceable evidence that is available. Material evidence includes pottery, burial goods, the remains of individuals and animals such as bones, jewellery and decorative items as well as many other artefacts. The subfield has existed since at least the late 1820s or early 1830s and is now a fully recognised and separate field of archaeology. Other fields of archaeology include; Classical archaeology, Near Eastern archaeology - as known as Biblical archaeology, Historical archaeology, Underwater archaeology and many more, each working to reconstruct our understanding of everything from the ancient past right up until modern times. Unlike continent and area specific fields of archaeology such as; Classical - which studies specifically the Mediterranean region and the civilisations of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome in antiquity, the field of prehistoric archaeology is not contained to one continent. As such, there are many excavations attributed to this field which have occurred and are occurring all over the world to uncover all different types of settlements and civilisations. 

Without history to provide evidence for names, places and motivations, prehistoric archaeologists speak in terms of cultures which can only be given arbitrary modern names relating to the locations of known occupation sites or the artifacts used. It is naturally much easier to discuss societies rather than individuals as these past people are completely anonymous in the archaeological record. Such a lack of concrete information means that prehistoric archaeology is a contentious field and the arguments that range over it have done much to inform archaeological theory.

==Origins==
Prehistoric archaeology, as with many other fields of archaeology, is attributed to multiple different individuals therefore an accurate and definitive timeline for its creation is difficult to present. The origins of prehistoric archaeology were marked by treasure hunting also known as antiquarianism and the individuals involved were not focused on scientific enquiry, as such the line between when the field moved from gathering artefacts to legitimate study is difficult to define. The first mention and use of the word prehistoric in archaeological terms was in the works of Daniel Wilson in 1851 within his book ‘The Archaeology and Prehistoric Annals of Scotland’, another early instance of prehistoric being used archaeologically is within Paul Tournal’s work in 1833 where he uses préhistoire to describe his work in Bize-Minervois located in the south of France. The phrase prehistoric archaeology did not officially become an English archaeological term until 1836, and further, the common three-age system coined by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen which classifies European prehistoric chronology was also invented during this year.

Beyond that, there are three other individuals who represented different field schools who are thought to have begun the first excavations dedicated solely to the study of prehistoric archaeology at roughly the same time between the 1820s to 1830s. Boucher de Perthes – a French archaeologist leading the Abbeville field school who uncovered handaxes in the Somme River, Jens Jacob Worsaae – a Danish archaeologist leading the Copenhagen field school who studied stratified assemblages in Denmark, and Giuseppe Scarabelli – an Italian archaeologist who led the Imola field school who studied stratigraphy in Italy. 
Outside of these individuals, each continent began to host excavations and field schools to explore their own prehistory across a wide spectrum of dates. Several examples, though not a complete list of every country, are listed below by continental area. Within Europe exploration began in England with several individuals such as amateur archaeologist William Pengelly who studied the Kent Cavern in approximately 1846, and within Turkey excavation into specifically prehistoric archaeological sites did not begin until much later between the 1980s to the 1990s into the region of Anatolia. In Asia and Australasia, prehistoric archaeology began in China in the 1920s with the work of amateur Swedish archaeologist Johan Gunnar Andersson who uncovered Homo erectus fossils in the Zhoukoudian cave in southwest Beijing and excavated Yangshao in Henan, in India excavation began with the works of Captain H. Congreve in 1847, in Japan prehistoric archaeology as it is defined by European standards began with the works of German collector Heinrich von Siebold in 1869 – though there had been an internal interest in prehistoric archaeology since the 1700s, in Vietnam excavation began in 1960 and in Australia the discipline of archaeology was solidified in the 1960s and 70s which allowed it to begin to expand and include Indigenous peoples and their heritage. In North America exploration began in the United States in the mid-1800s with the collective excavation interests being led by the works of the American Philosophical Society, the American Antiquarian Society, and the Smithsonian Institution and in Canada excavations started in 1935 though it was not until 1965 that it fully took off as an important field of archaeology. In South America within Argentina excavations began between 1880 and 1910. In Africa investigations into prehistoric civilisations began in roughly the 1960s and 70s and further prehistoric archaeology began explorations into the Middle East in areas such as Iran in 1884 with excavations by the French at Susa.

==Purpose==
The purpose of prehistoric archaeology is to explore and understand civilisations that existed before writing systems; including the Stone, Bronze and Iron Age societies across the world. Within its early origins prehistoric archaeology had a focus on gathering artefacts and treasures to display in museums and private collections often to bring wealth back for the individual. Later on the field allowed for the more legitimate study of material evidence and data in order to ascertain important details such as; when the site may have been occupied, who was living there, what activities they may have engaged in, and finally what happened to them to either cause them to leave or make the area uninhabitable.

==Notable archaeologists==
There are multitudes of credible past and emerging prehistoric archaeologists who have dedicated time and effort into honing their craft in order to accurately understand the lives of the individuals and societies they are studying. Some of the important foundational archaeologists are; Daniel Wilson – a Scottish-born Canadian archaeologist who first brought the term prehistoric into an archaeological context, Paul Tournal – a French amateur archaeologist, Christian Jürgensen Thomsen – a Danish antiquarian who classified the three age system important to aiding early European archaeological works, Boucher de Perthes – a French archaeologist who uncovered handaxes in the Somme River, Jens Jacob Worsaae – a Danish archaeologist who studied stratified assemblages in Denmark, Giuseppe Scarabelli – an Italian archaeologist who studied stratigraphy in Italy, and William Pengelly – an English archaeologist. They each fundamentally contributed to beginning the field of archaeology through defining how the subfield is different to archaeology.

More modern archaeologists, including Ali Umut Türkcan – who directed the excavations at Çatalhöyük as of 2022, have helped to further these developments in the field by directing excavations and studying materials found within the sites. Other modern archaeologists include; Paul Bahn – a British archaeologist who studies prehistoric rock art, Richard Bradley – a British archaeologist who specialises in European prehistory and has a particular focus on Prehistoric Britain, E. C. L. During Caspers (also known as Elizabeth Christina Louisa During Caspers) – a Dutch archaeologist who studied prehistoric Mesopotamia, Ufuk Esin – a Turkish archaeologist who specialised in prehistoric Anatolia, Pere Bosch-Gimpera – a Spanish-born Mexican archaeologist who studied prehistoric Spain, Lynne Goldstein – an American specialising in prehistoric eastern North America, Jakob Heierli – a Swedish archaeologist who studied prehistoric Sweden, Louise Steel – a British archaeologist who focused on prehistoric Cyprus, and Joyce White – an American archaeologist who specialises in prehistoric Southeast Asia. There are many more individuals whose importance to the continuation of this field has not been stated or acknowledged here.

==Main types and locations of sites==

Some of the main types of sites include early proto-city and proto city-states, settlements, temples and sanctuaries of worship and cave sites. To define each of these terms archaeologically; a proto city-state is a large town or village that existed in the Neolithic era, it is also categorised by its lack of central rule or deliberate city organisation of infrastructure. A settlement is an area where individuals lived either permanently or semi-permanently, conversely temples or sanctuaries were areas of cult practice or worship to the gods or beings associated with the specific people, areas of worship in early prehistoric sites or periods can also include spiritual areas of prominent religious importance without the presence of a directly associated deity. Cave sites are sheltered areas, usually in rock formations where individual members of a society may have gathered together in either semi-permanent or permanent basis to create art, to dwell or to prepare food. All prehistoric archaeology sites must contain evidence of humans – even if they did not actively live on the site or visited it occasionally, and a lack of historical record within the society. Sites that feature the ability of the inhabitants to record information about themselves are not considered prehistoric.
Prehistoric settlements are scattered all over the world, they vary in age and size. The period in which prehistoric archaeology covers is most often the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages, within each of these ages periods such as the Neolithic within the Stone age are explored deeply. In Western Europe the prehistoric period ends with Roman colonisation in 43 AD, with some non-Romanised areas the period does not end until as late as the 5th Century AD. Although in many other places, notably Egypt (at the end of the Third Intermediate Period ) it finishes much earlier and in others, such as Australia, much later. Some of the main sites that are being studied are; Çatalhöyük in Turkey, the Chauvet Cave in southern France, Bouldnor Cliff Mesolithic Village in the United Kingdom and Franchthi in Greece among many others. New sites are being uncovered regularly and their importance to understanding prehistoric peoples continues to further our knowledge of the past.

==Methods of investigation and analysis==
Archaeologists use many different methods to research the artefacts and materials that may be found during an excavation. Within early excavations dedicated to treasure hunting little to no care was taken when removing soil covering artefacts or when removing the artefacts and materials themselves from sites which may have led to the destruction of materials and has placed some recovered artefacts at risk. Often the digs were conducted by amateurs and treasure hunters who did not have the knowledge we do now about how to remove artefacts safely. Some of the main techniques used to gently recover artefacts or to ensure the integrity of the site remains for future exploration and the preservation of the site are; aerial photography – to survey the site, stratigraphic measurements – which document the layers of soil to aid in site dating, fieldwalking - which involves walking the ground and looking for objects and making site plans to record the locations of objects and remains on a site. Within aerial photography several important markers of archaeological sites can be revealed such as; shadow marks, crop marks and soil marks. Archaeologists also use a range of techniques when excavating a site to uncover materials including; digging test pits, creating trenches and using the box-grid or quadrant method to keep track of different areas of the site.

Some of the technology used to assist in looking for and uncovering materials in prehistoric archaeological sites are; electrical resistivity meters – which help locate objects underground non-disruptively, laser theodolites – to help map the site layout, satellite survey - which uses satellites to get an aerial view of the site, lidar - which uses lasers to scan for objects underground and sonar - which uses soundwaves to scan the earth for objects. None of these techniques are solely practised within prehistoric archaeology, most archaeological techniques may be used across many of the different subfields of archaeology.

==Issues in the field==
There are a vast amount of difficulties faced within prehistoric archaeology including; site degradation, which makes understanding a site very difficult as it erases evidence that may have been useful for gaining insight into the civilisation. Degradation of a site may be exacerbated by climate change as often prehistoric sites are delicate due to the nature of their age, for example, material evidence such as textile fabric which may have survived from antiquity in rare contexts due to being buried may be lost due to the top layers of the site being uncovered. However, as cosmologist Martin Rees and astronomer Carl Sagan have said ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’ which is highly relevant within the field of prehistoric archaeology as often archaeologists must work with missing pieces and theorise in order to understand a site. Due to the substantial gaps that exist in the prehistoric record, there are many periods of time, inventions and materials – particularly those that were made out of perishable materials such as wood or textile fabrics, that have been lost to time or that are incredibly difficult to locate due to the conditions that must exist in order for them to survive. It is because of these gaps that in order to understand the physical evidence that has been recovered prehistoric archaeologists, as well as their counterparts in the sibling fields of archaeology, must make educated guesses as to what is there and what should be there based on the finds that they have. The variety of theories regarding the purpose of objects or sites for example obliges archaeologists to adopt a critical approach to all evidence and to examine their own constructs of the past. Structural functionalism and processualism are two schools of archaeological thought which have made a great contribution to prehistoric archaeology.

Other issues within the field of prehistoric archaeology which also affect every other branch of archaeology is the ethics of removing artefacts and or storing finds in museums. This moral question is a delicate balance within prehistoric archaeology as all finds and bodies must be treated with respect but archaeologists also wish to study them in order to further their understanding of the different origins of humanity.

<text>A dungeon crawl is a type of scenario in fantasy role-playing games (RPGs) in which heroes navigate a labyrinth environment (a &quot;dungeon&quot;), battling various monsters, avoiding traps, solving puzzles, and looting any treasure they may find. Video games and board games which predominantly feature dungeon crawl elements are considered to be a genre.

== Board games ==
Dungeon crawling in board games dates to 1975 when Gary Gygax introduced &quot;Solo Dungeon Adventures&quot;. That year also saw the release of &quot;Dungeon!&quot;. Over the years, many games built on that concept. One of the most acclaimed board games of the late 2010s, &quot;Gloomhaven&quot;, is a dungeon crawler.

==Video games==

The first computer-based dungeon crawl was &quot;pedit5&quot;, developed in 1975 by Rusty Rutherford on the PLATO interactive education system based in Urbana, Illinois. Although this game was quickly deleted from the system, several more like it appeared, including &quot;dnd&quot; and &quot;Moria&quot;.

Computer games and series from the 1980s, such as &quot;Rogue&quot;, &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Soldier&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, &quot;Gauntlet&quot;, &quot;Madō Monogatari&quot;, &quot;Megami Tensei&quot;, &quot;Might and Magic&quot;, &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;, &quot;Ultima&quot;, and &quot;Wizardry&quot;, helped set the standards of the genre. Their primitive graphics were conducive to this style, due to the need for repetitive tiles or similar-looking graphics to create effective mazes. &quot;Game Developer&quot;″s Matt Barton described &quot;Telengard&quot; (1982) as a &quot;pure dungeon crawler&quot; for its lack of diversions, and noted its expansive dungeons as a &quot;key selling point&quot;.

Some dungeon crawlers from this era also employed action role-playing game combat, such as &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, and &quot;The Tower of Druaga&quot;. Games that grew out of this style are also considered dungeon crawlers, in that the player is limited to the confines of the walls of the dungeon, but still allows for complex systems around combat, enemy behavior, and loot systems, as well as the potential for multiplayer and online play. &quot;Gauntlet&quot;, &quot;Diablo&quot;, &quot;The Binding of Isaac&quot; and &quot;Enter the Gungeon&quot; are examples of these dungeon crawlers.

Variations on the dungeon crawl can be found in other genres. In the early 2010s there was a modest resurgence in their popularity, particularly in Japan, largely due to the success of the &quot;Etrian Odyssey&quot; series by Atlus.

=== Instance dungeon ===
In massively multiplayer online games, an instance is a special area, typically a dungeon or a restricted dungeon-like environment, that generates a new copy of the location for each group or certain number of players that enters the area. Instancing, the general term for the use of this technique, addresses several problems encountered by players in the shared spaces of virtual worlds, but also sacrifices the social element of shared spaces and realistic immersion in that virtual world. They also tend to be a lot smaller and more linear.

===First-person party-based dungeon crawlers===

This subgenre consists of RPGs where the player leads a party of adventurers in first-person perspective, typically in a grid-based environment. Examples include the aforementioned &quot;Wizardry&quot;, &quot;Might and Magic&quot; and &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; series; as well as the &quot;Etrian Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Elminage&quot; series. Games of this type are also known as &quot;blobbers&quot;, since the player moves the entire party around the playing field as a single unit, or &quot;blob&quot;.

Many &quot;blobbers&quot; are turn-based, such as the play-by-mail game &quot;Heroic Fantasy&quot;, but some games such as &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, &quot;Legend of Grimrock&quot; and &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; series are played in real-time. Early games in this genre lack an automap feature, forcing players to draw their own maps in order to keep track of their progress. Spatial puzzles are common, and players may have to, for instance, move a stone in one part of the level in order to open a gate in another part of the level.

<doc id="642780" wikidata="Q559224" url="?curid=642780" title="Pope Avilius of Alexandria">
<text>Pope Avilius of Alexandria (also known as Abilius, Sabellius, Abylius, Abitius, Milius and Melyos) (? – 95 AD), was the 3rd Patriarch of Alexandria.

==Overview==
Upon the death of Anianus of Alexandria, the suffragan bishops and priests of the area converged with the laity in Alexandria and unanimously elected Avilius in the month of December (Kiahk), 83 AD, during the reign of the Roman Emperor Domitian.

Pope Avilius was known for his chastity, and was pious and caring towards the people of Christ. He continued to establish the people in faith and the Christians grew in number in Egypt and in the five western provinces, and Sudan. During his time serving, the Egyptian people began renouncing the worshiping of idols and practiced their Christianity together, in groups. Despite the religion of Egypt being Roman Paganism, his time as pope was a time of peace for the church.

While some historians claim that Emperor Domitian expelled Avilius from the episcopal throne, and installed another in his place, there is no written record of this. According to historical records, he remained in his position for twelve years, and died on the first of &quot;Thout&quot; (11 September), in the year 95. Avilius was buried next to the remains of St. Mark the Evangelist in the Church of Baucalis in Alexandria.

==Veneration==
He is venerated as a saint in various churches. His feast day in the Coptic Church is on The Coptic New Year 1 Thout, which is September 11 in the Gregorian calendar, and on 29 August and 29 March in the Catholic Church, and February 22 in Eastern Orthodox Church.

<text>The Mayor of Warrington is the highest-ranking officer in the municipal government of Warrington, England.

==Role==
The Mayor of Warrington, as the first person of the borough, chairs meetings of Warrington Borough Council. Elected for one year, the mayor also is a representative of the town who is responsible for officially welcoming people and inviting people to the town. The mayor officially hosts civic events of the town. In this role and the mayor promotes the town of Warrington to attract more investment and visitors to the area.

==History==
The first mayor of Warrington was William Beamont. He became mayor following the incorporation of the borough in 1847. At that time, 27 councillors from the then much smaller borough were appointed to the small town hall in the centre of modern Warrington. As the town increased in size, the council was moved to Bank Hall, the former home of Lord Winmarleigh for £9,700. This is still the town hall and its &quot;golden gates&quot; are one of the town&#x27;s attractions.

<doc id="642791" wikidata="Q4483668" url="?curid=642791" title="Punxsutawney Phil">
<text>Punxsutawney Phil () is a groundhog residing in Young Township near Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, United States, who is the central figure in Punxsutawney&#x27;s annual Groundhog Day celebration.

== Folklore ==
On February 2 each year, Punxsutawney holds a civic festival with music and food. During the ceremony, which begins well before the winter sunrise, Phil emerges from his temporary home on Gobbler&#x27;s Knob, located in a rural area about southeast of the town. According to the tradition, if Phil sees his shadow and returns to his hole, he has predicted six more weeks of winter-like weather. If Phil does not see his shadow, he has predicted an &quot;early spring.&quot; Punxsutawney&#x27;s event is the most famous of many Groundhog Day festivals held in the United States and Canada. The event formally began in 1887, although its roots go back even further.

The event is based upon a communal light-hearted suspension of disbelief which extends to the assertion that the same groundhog has been making predictions since the 19th century.

The event is organized by the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; – recognizable by their top hats and tuxedos – who ostensibly communicate with Phil to receive his prediction.
The vice president of the Inner Circle prepares two scrolls in advance of the actual ceremony, one proclaiming six more weeks of winter and one proclaiming an early spring. At daybreak on February 2, Punxsutawney Phil awakens from his burrow on Gobbler&#x27;s Knob, is helped to the top of the stump by his handlers, and purportedly explains to the president of the Inner Circle, in a language known as &quot;Groundhogese&quot;, whether he has seen his shadow. The president of the Inner Circle, the only person able to understand Groundhogese through his possession of an ancient acacia wood cane, then interprets Phil&#x27;s message, and directs the vice president to read the proper scroll to the crowd gathered on Gobbler&#x27;s Knob and the masses of &quot;phaithphil phollowers&quot; tuned in to live broadcasts around the world.

Outside of Groundhog Day, Phil resides with a mate, Phyllis, at the Punxsutawney Memorial Library in a climate-controlled environment. In March 2024, the Inner Circle announced that Phil had sired two babies, the first time in the history of the event that such a siring had happened; the birth surprised the Inner Circle, which had assumed that groundhogs do not breed in captivity. As a result of the births, the family will move permanently to Gobbler&#x27;s Knob. The Inner Circle disowned the babies from ever inheriting their father&#x27;s position.

== Punxsutawney Phil canon ==
The practices and lore of Punxsutawney Phil&#x27;s predictions are predicated on a light-hearted suspension of disbelief by those involved. According to the lore, there is only one Phil, and all other groundhogs are impostors. It is claimed that this one groundhog has lived to make weather prognostications since 1886, sustained by drinks of &quot;groundhog punch&quot; or &quot;elixir of life&quot; administered at the annual Groundhog Picnic in the fall. The lifespan of a groundhog in the wild is roughly six years.

According to the Groundhog Club, Phil, after the prediction, speaks to the club president in the language of &#x27;Groundhogese&#x27;, which supposedly only the current president can understand, and then his prediction is translated and revealed to all.

The Groundhog Day celebration is rooted in Germanic tradition that says that if a hibernating animal casts a shadow on February 2, the Christian celebration of Candlemas, winter and cold weather will last another six weeks. If no shadow is seen, legend says, spring will come early. In Germany, the tradition evolved into a myth that if the sun came out on Candlemas, a hedgehog would cast its shadow, predicting snow all the way into May. When German immigrants settled in Pennsylvania, they transferred the tradition onto local fauna, replacing hedgehogs with groundhogs. Several other towns in the region hold similar Groundhog Day events.

Phil first received his name in 1961. The origins of the name are unclear, but speculation suggests that it may have been indirectly named after Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

== Reception ==

Prior to 1993, the Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney attracted crowds of approximately 2,000. The popularity of the film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; brought significantly more attention to the event, with annual crowds rising to 10,000–20,000. A notable exception was 2021, when the event took place without any crowds due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since approximately 2018, the event is streamed online each year.

Also given the recent increase in crowd sizes, three sitting governors of Pennsylvania have attended the festivities, all since 2000: Ed Rendell in 2003, Tom Corbett in 2012, and Josh Shapiro in 2023, 2024 and 2025.

Phil was named the &quot;Official&quot; State Meteorologist by Governor Shapiro during the 2024 ceremony.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals object to the event, claiming that Phil is put under stress. They suggest replacing Phil with a robotic groundhog.

In some cases where Phil&#x27;s prognostications have been incorrect, organizations have jokingly made legal threats against the groundhog. Such tongue-in-cheek actions have been made by a prosecutor in Ohio, the sheriff&#x27;s office of Monroe County, Pennsylvania, and the Merrimack, New Hampshire Police Department.

== In media and popular culture ==

* Phil and the town of Punxsutawney were portrayed in the 1993 film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. The actual town used to portray Punxsutawney in the film is Woodstock, Illinois.
* In &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, the 2016 Broadway musical adaptation of the film, Phil is ascribed a more mythical role.
* In 1995, Phil flew to Chicago for a guest appearance on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, which aired on Groundhog Day, February 2, 1995.
* A 2002 episode of the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Stanley&quot;, titled &quot;Searching for Spring&quot;, featured Punxsutawney Phil.
* Phil was the main attraction in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, the April 10, 2005 episode of the MTV series &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;. In the episode, street skater Bam Margera holds a downhill race in honor of Punxsutawney Phil at Bear Creek Mountain Resort in Macungie, Pennsylvania.
* The Pennsylvania Lottery&#x27;s mascot is a groundhog named Gus, referred to in commercials as &quot;the second most famous groundhog in Pennsylvania&quot;, in deference to Phil. Because the Groundhog Club Inner Circle has trademarked the use of the name &quot;Punxsutawney Phil&quot;, no commercial entity may use the name without the permission from the Inner Circle, which does not allow commercialization of the name.
* Phil is the antagonist of the 2024 play &quot;How to Kill a Rodent&quot;. In the play, Canadians Guy and Carrie go to Punxsutawney to commit an act of terrorism against the United States by assassinating Phil on live television.

== Past predictions ==


=== Predictive accuracy ===
The Inner Circle, in keeping with the suspension of disbelief, claims a 100% accuracy rate, and an approximately 80% accuracy rate in recorded predictions. They claim that whenever the prediction is wrong, the person in charge of translating the message must have made a mistake in their interpretation. Impartial estimates place the groundhog&#x27;s accuracy between 35% and 41%.

<text>Westy is a suburban district in Warrington, England. It lies between the River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal. The village of Westy is a suburban area, itself unofficially a suburb of Latchford. The area features mainly inter-war council housing, however some of these homes are now privately owned. There is an apparent strong community spirit with its hub at the community centre and also a thriving community hall based within St Margaret&#x27;s Community Centre on Lindley Avenue, hosting activities for all age groups.

<text>Resistance to interrogation, RTI or R2I is a type of military training to British and other NATO soldiers to prepare them, after capture by the enemy, to resist interrogation techniques such as humiliation and torture.

The trainees undergo practices such as hooding, sleep deprivation, time disorientation, prolonged nakedness, sexual humiliation and deprivation of warmth, water and food. Many of these techniques are against international law if used in interrogations.

In such interrogation sessions, the subjects must maintain dead silence regardless of the practice being inflicted on them. Only three pieces of information can be surrendered: name, rank and serial number. Both the subjects and the practitioner have a right to insist on a return to unit every hour.

Standard RTI for most special military branches of American and European governments covers both tortures that are condemned by the United Nations and interrogation techniques that are considered legitimate, usually presented along a sliding scale. For instance, a soldier would be subjected to slight discomforts before being subjected to more torturous techniques.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; has reported that according to a former British special forces officer, the acts committed by U.S. Army soldiers who committed torture and prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib resembled the techniques used in RTI training.
