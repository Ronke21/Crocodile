<text>The Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure (SSCLI), previously codenamed Rotor, is Microsoft&#x27;s shared source implementation of the CLI, the core of .NET. Although the SSCLI is not suitable for commercial use due to its license, it does make it possible for programmers to examine the implementation details of many .NET libraries and to create modified CLI versions. Microsoft provides the Shared Source CLI as a reference CLI implementation suitable for educational use.

==History==
Beginning in 2001, Microsoft announced they would release part of the .NET Framework infrastructure source code in Shared source through ECMA, as part of the C# and CLI standardization process.

In March 2002, Microsoft released version 1.0 of the Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure, also called Rotor. The Shared Source CLI was initially pre-configured to run on Windows, but could also be built on FreeBSD (version 4.7 or newer), and Mac OS X 10.2. It was designed such that the only thing that needed to be customized to port the Shared Source CLI to a different platform was a thin Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL).

The last 2.0 version of SSCLI was released in March 2006, and contains most of the classes and features of version 2.0 of the .NET Framework. SSCLI 2.0 can be downloaded directly from Microsoft downloads and requires Perl and Visual Studio 2005 running on Windows XP SP2 to compile. Microsoft has not updated the source and build requirements since 2006. Even Microsoft MVPs, important part of Microsoft community ecosystem, complained about the lack of support for other Visual Studio versions and operating systems. However, a non-official patch for Visual Studio 2008 was provided by a Microsoft employee in the MSDN Blog and another for Visual Studio 2010 was released by the community.

Later versions of .NET, originally known as .NET Core and now referred to simply as .NET, have been open sourced under the more permissive MIT license.

==License==
The Shared Source CLI use the non-free Microsoft Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure license. This license allows modifications and redistribution of the code for personal or academic usages, but they can&#x27;t be used for commercial products.

<text>Anjeza Shahini (; born 4 May 1987) is an Albanian singer. She is best known for being the first representative of Albania at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2004, after winning the 42nd edition of Festivali i Këngës.

== Career ==

=== 2003–2009 ===

Anjeza Shahini was born on 4 May 1987 in the city of Tirana, then part of the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania, present Albania. In 2003, Shahini won the first edition of &quot;Ethet e së premtes mbrëma&quot;. In later 2003, along with 29 other singers, she competed in the Festivali I Këngës 42 with the song &quot;Imazhi yt&quot;. After two preliminary rounds, Shahini reached the final on 20 December, at the end of which, hosts Adi Krasta and Ledina Çelo presented her as the winner of the combined jury and televote. That meant she would represent Albania in the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest in Istanbul, Turkey, in Albania&#x27;s debut year in the competition. For the ESC finals, a three-minute English version of the song entitled &quot;The Image of You&quot; was created. Anjeza sang in the semi-final of ESC on 12 May 2004, and finished fourth out of twenty-two. This top-ten finish, secured Anjeza a place in the final where on 15 May she competed with contestants from twenty-four other countries and finished seventh with a total of 106 points.
 
In 2004, Anjeza recorded a song (&quot;Në mes nesh&quot;) with Kosovo-Albanian band Marigona. In 2005 she signed a contract with an artist management agency based in Vienna. During her two years in Vienna she continued private studies in music and collaborated with the well known Austrian producer Harald Hanisch, including the song &quot;Pse Ndal&quot; (Why Stop) which was used at the Albanian National Song Festival (Festivali i Këngës), the Albanian selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest. &quot;Anjeza Shahini&quot; made it through the two semi-finals to the last twenty at the National Final and was one of the favourites to win. However, at the final, which aired on 18 December 2005, the winner was announced as the song &quot;Zjarr e ftohtë&quot;, sung by Luiz Ejlli.

On 3 June 2006, Anjeza Shahini was a special guest performer at the Euro Video Grand Prix contest, which was held in Albania. She opened the contest with the song &quot;Welcome to Europe&quot;.

In 2007, Anjeza returned to Albania and signed a contract with the Albanian record label &quot;Eurostar&quot;. She performed at Këngët e Shekullit 2, a successful series on TV Klan consisting of remakes of the best Albanian songs from the past century. She took part in Kënga Magjike 2007 with the song &quot;Nxënësja më e mirë&quot; (&quot;The best student&quot;), where the other singers&#x27; votes landed her in 4th place, but she did receive the critics&#x27; award.

In August 2008, Anjeza Shahini released her first album, &quot;Erdhi momenti&quot;, containing only new songs, all in Albanian. Some of the songs were composed by Adrian Hila, but she also collaborated with other well known composers such as Pirro Cako, Alfred Kacinari and Genti Myftaraj and some of the lyrics were written by Anjeza&#x27;s sister, Bela. The songs &quot;Erdhi Momenti&quot; and &quot;Lot Pendimi&quot; were promoted with a music video produced by Max Production.

Anjeza Shahini took part in Festivali i Këngës 48 with the ballad &quot;Në pasqyrë&quot; (In the mirror), placing second.

=== 2010s ===

In 2010, Shahini finished her contract with Eurostar and became an independent artist. In the same year she completed her studies in International Relations at the European University of Tirana. In 2011, she participated for the first time in Top Fest performing a duet with Kosovo band Dren Abazi &amp; Zig Zag Orchestra. Their song &quot;Ti dhe une&quot; got &quot;Best Interpretation&quot; award. A music video was released after in partnership with &quot;PinkMoon&quot; production. In 2012, she released the ballad &quot;Te desha shume&quot;, composed by Endrit Shani and produced by Sebastian Video Production.

Anjeza Shahini was again very close to winning &quot;Festivali I Kenges&quot; in 2013 with the song &quot;LOVE&quot;, but the jury placed her second.

Anjeza Shahini was a guest in the new release of the German artist Martin Kilger in the song &quot;Kastanien Lied&quot; a song dedicated to Albania,she plays the role of Albanian girl, singing her part in the Albanian language.

During 2014 she released three singles in collaboration with the songwriter Mario Deda. Together they produced &quot;Ujë në shkretëtirë&quot; a triphop ballad. The video was produced in partnership with ID Production. Soon that year they released the song &quot;Magnet&quot; a project supported by an Albanian development company. The video produced by Entermedia showcases tall and new buildings of Tirana projecting a new, futuristic capital city of Albania, (electronic pop-dance).

In October 2014, Shahini released the song &quot;Energji&quot; (Energy), an electronic pop-drum &amp; bass, the song was performed at Kenga Magjike and received the award &quot;Tendence&quot; (Best Trend Song).

Anjeza appeared on the BBC Eurovision 2017 semi-final show with Scott Mills and Lucie Jones and performed at the second annual Eurostarz event in London, together with other Eurovision former acts, including Anne Marie David, Kurt Calleja, Mihai Traistariu, Karl William Lund and Salena Mastroianni.

=== 2020s ===
On 27 October 2023, Shahini co-hosted, alongside Adi Krasta and Besim Dina, the second night of the Kosovan version of Festivali i Këngës, at its inaugural edition.

<text>The Jaguar XJ is a series of mid-size/full-size luxury cars produced by British automobile manufacturer Jaguar Cars (becoming Jaguar Land Rover in 2013) from 1968 to 2019. It was produced across four basic platform generations (debuting in 1968, 1986, 2003, and 2009) with various updated derivatives of each. From 1970, it was Jaguar&#x27;s flagship four-door model. The original model was the last Jaguar saloon to have been designed under the leadership of Sir William Lyons, the company&#x27;s founder, and the model has been featured in countless media and high-profile appearances.

== Series 1, 2, and 3 (1968–1992)==
The first generation Jaguar XJ was produced for a total period of 24 years, with two major facelifts – in 1973 and in 1979, with a raised front bumper and less tall grilles.

For four years, the 1968 introduced XJ (later known as the Series 1) was a four-door, straight-six saloon on a wheelbase. In 1972, a more spacious, longer wheelbase (LWB) option, and a 5.3 litre V12 engine were added. On the XJ series 2 (from 1973), the standard wheelbase (SWB) saloons were cancelled in 1974 – but a SWB two-door (series II only) coupé was sold from 1975–1978.

The 1979 series 3 saloons received a redesigned greenhouse (upper body) and bumpers. The 6-cylinder series 3 models were replaced by the second generation Jaguar XJ in 1987, but the V12 models were not replaced until 1992.

===Series 1 (1968–1973)===

The XJ6 replaced most of Jaguar&#x27;s saloons – which, in the 1960s, had expanded to four separate ranges. It carried over the 2.8-litre () and 4.2-litre () cylinder versions of Jaguar&#x27;s renowned straight-six XK engine, and front and rear suspensions, from previous models: the widest version of Jaguar&#x27;s IRS unit from the Mark X, and the subframe-mounted independent front suspension first seen in the 1955 Mark 1, with new anti-dive geometry.
An upmarket version was marketed as the Daimler Sovereign, continuing the name from the Daimler version of the Jaguar 420. The car was introduced in September 1968. Power-assisted steering and leather upholstery were standard on the 2.8 L De Luxe and 4.2 L models. Air conditioning was offered as an optional extra on the 4.2 L Daimler versions, which were launched in October 1969 in a series of television advertisements featuring Sir William. In these advertisements, he referred to the car as &quot;the finest Jaguar ever&quot;. An unusual feature inherited from the Mark X and S-Type saloons was the twin fuel tanks, positioned on each side of the boot, and filled using two separately lockable filler caps: one on the top of each wing above the rear wheel arches. Preliminary reviews of the car were favourable, noting the effective brakes and good ride quality.

In March 1970, it was announced that the Borg-Warner Model 8 automatic transmission, which the XJ6 had featured since 1968, would be replaced on the 4.2-litre XJ6 with the Borg-Warner Model 12. The new transmission had three different forward positions accessed via the selector lever, which effectively enabled performance oriented drivers to hold lower ratios at higher revs to achieve better acceleration. &quot;Greatly improved shift quality&quot; was also claimed for the new system. Around this time other, minor changes were made as well, such as moving the rear reflectors from beside to below the rear lights; on the interior the chrome gauge bezels were replaced with black ones, to cut down on distracting reflections. In 1972, the option of a long-wheelbase version, providing a 4-inch increase in leg room for passengers on the rear seats, became available.
A high-performance version called the XJ12 was announced in July 1972, featuring a simplified grille treatment, and powered by a Jaguar&#x27;s 5.3 L V12 engine coupled to the Borg-Warner Model 12 transmission. At the time, it was the only mass-produced 12-cylinder, four-door car in the world and, with a top speed of &quot;around&quot; , it was the &quot;fastest full four-seater available in the world&quot;.

Although it had been the manufacturer&#x27;s intention from launch that the XJ would use the 12-cylinder engine its installation was nonetheless a tight fit, and providing adequate cooling had been a challenge for Jaguar&#x27;s engineers. Bonnet louvres such as those fitted on the 12-cylinder E-Type were rejected and instead the XJ12 featured a complex &quot;cross-flow&quot; radiator divided into two separated horizontal sections supported with coolant feeder tanks at each end. The engine fan was geared to rotate at 1¼ times the speed of the engine, subject to a limiter which cut in at a fan speed of 1,700 rpm. The fuel system incorporated a relief valve that returned fuel to the tank when pressure in the lines to the carburettors exceeded 1.5 psi, to reduce the risk of vapour locks occurring at the high operating temperatures, while the car&#x27;s battery had its own thermostatically-controlled cooling fan.
3,228 Series 1 XJ12s were built. A badge-engineered version, the Daimler Double-Six, was introduced in 1972, reviving the Daimler model name of 1926–1938.


===Series 2 (1973–1979)===
The XJ line received a facelift in Autumn 1973 for the 1974 model year, thereafter known as the Series II; retrospectively the earlier cars were referred to as the Series I. The 4.2 L XJ6 straight-6 engine (most popular in the United Kingdom) and the 5.3 L V12 XJ12 were continued with an addition of a version of the XK engine available from 1975. The Series II and Series II coupé were the last Jaguar models with direct input by Sir William Lyons before his retirement.

Initially, the Series II was offered with two wheelbases, but at the 1974 London Motor Show Jaguar announced the withdrawal of the standard wheelbase version: subsequent saloons all featured the extra 4 inches (10 cm) of passenger cabin length hitherto featured only on the long-wheelbase model. By this time, the first customer deliveries of the two-door coupe, which retained the shorter standard-wheelbase (and which had already been formally launched more than a year earlier) were only months away.

Series II cars are visually differentiated from their predecessors by raised front bumpers to meet US crash safety regulations, which necessitated a smaller grille, complemented by a discreet additional inlet directly below the bumper. The interior received a substantial update, including simplified heating and A/C systems to address criticisms of the complex and not very effective Series I systems.

In April 1975, the North American models got a slightly revised set of front bumpers which had rubber over-riders covering the full length of the bumper with embedded turn signals at each end, and the Zenith-Stromberg carburettors of the V12-powered cars were replaced by Bosch-Lucas electronic fuel injection. In 1978 the carburettors were similarly replaced with EFI in the 4.2 L 6-cylinder XJ6L. In May 1977, it was announced that the 12-cylinder engine would receive the General Motors&#x27; three-speed &quot;Turbo-Hydramatic 400&quot; automatic transmission in place of the British-built Borg-Warner.

The 1978 UK model range included the Jaguar XJ 3.4, XJ 4.2, XJ 5.3, Daimler Sovereign 4.2, Double-Six 5.3, Daimler Vanden Plas 4.2 and Double-Six Vanden Plas 5.3. In New Zealand, knock-down kits of the Series II were assembled locally by the New Zealand Motor Corporation (NZMC) at their Nelson plant. In the last year of production in New Zealand (1978), a special &#x27;SuperJag&#x27; (XJ6-SLE) model was produced which featured half leather, half dralon wide pleat seats, vinyl roof, chrome steel wheels and air conditioning as standard. New Zealand produced models featured speedometers in km/h, and the black vinyl mats sewn onto the carpets in the front footwells featured the British Leyland &quot;L&quot; logo.

Though worldwide production of the Series II ended in 1979, a number were produced in Cape Town, South Africa until 1981. A total of 91,227 Series II models were produced, of which 14,226 were fitted with the V12 engine.

=== XJ Coupé===
A 9,378 car production run of two-door XJ coupés with a pillarless hardtop body called the XJ-C was built between 1975 and November 1977, in addition to about 2,000 Daimler-badged examples. The car was originally shown at the London Motor Show in October 1973, but it subsequently became clear that it was not ready for production. The economic troubles resulting from the 1973 oil crisis unfolding in the Western world at that time seemed to have reduced any sense of urgency about producing and selling the cars. Amongst other productionisation problems, sealing the frameless windows caused delays. XJ coupés finally started to appear in Jaguar show-rooms some two years later. The coupé was based on the short-wheelbase version of the XJ. The coupé&#x27;s elongated doors were made out of a lengthened standard XJ front door (the weld seams are clearly visible under the interior panels where two front door shells were grafted together with a single outer skin). A few XJ-C cars were modified by Lynx Cars and Avon into a convertible body style with a retractable canvas top, but this was not a factory product. Lynx conversions (16 in total) did benefit from powered tops. Both six and twelve-cylinder models were offered, 6,505 of the former and 1,873 of the latter were made. Even with the delays, these cars suffered from water leaks and wind noise. The delayed introduction, the labour-intensive work required by the modified saloon body, the higher price than the four-door car, and the early demise promulgated by the new XJ-S, all ensured a small production run.

All coupés came with a vinyl roof as standard. Since the coupé lacked B-pillars, the roof flexed enough that the paint used by Jaguar at the time would develop cracks. More modern paints do not suffer such problems, so when coupés are repainted it is advisable to remove the vinyl. Today many XJ-Cs thus no longer have their vinyl roof, which also minimises the threat of roof rust. Some owners also modified their XJ-C by changing to Series III bumpers. This lifted the front indicators from under the bumper and provided built in rear fog lights. A small number of Daimler versions of the XJ-C were made. One prototype of the Daimler Vanden Plas XJ-C was also made; however, this version never went into production.

The XJC was also raced, although the results were less than satisfying - memories of the failed effort made British Leyland decline to provide factory backing for the TWR-prepared XJS five years later. The XJ12C racing car was developed for the European Touring Car Championship by Ralph Broad of Broadspeed. With Derek Bell at the wheel, it briefly led its debut race, the RAC Tourist Trophy at Silverstone in September 1976, but failed to finish. This became the modus operandi for the XJC racing effort: Overweight and unreliable, the best result was a second place at Nürburgring in 1977 and British Leyland cancelled the program before completing the season.

=== Series 3 (1979–1992)===
The car was significantly facelifted again in April 1979, known as the Series III, incorporating a subtle exterior redesign by Pininfarina. Changes from the Series II included thicker and more incorporated rubber bumpers with decorative chrome only on the top edge, flush door handles, one-piece front door glass without a separate quarter light, a grille with only vertical vanes, reverse lights moved from the boot plinth to the larger rear light clusters, and a revised roofline with narrower door frames and increased glass area. The C-pillar was also subtly modified with a more prominent &quot;Hofmeister kink&quot; at its base. The option of a sunroof and cruise control were also offered for the first time. Also For the series 3 Jaguar asked Pirelli to develop a new tyre the Cinturato P5 to improve the handling and performance of these luxury cars in 205/70R15 Cinturato P5 for the 6 cylinder cars and 215/70R15 Cinturato P5 for the V12.

The 5.3 L V12, 4.2 L and 3.4 L straight-six engines carried over from the Series II, with minor changes. The larger six-cylinder and V12 models incorporated Bosch fuel injection (made under licence by Lucas) while the smaller six-cylinder remained carburetted. The smaller six-cylinder engine was never offered in the US, and the V12 was no longer offered there after 1980.

The 1979 UK model range included the Jaguar XJ6 3.4 and 4.2, XJ12 5.3, Daimler Sovereign 4.2 and Double-Six 5.3, and Daimler Vanden Plas 4.2 and Double-Six Vanden Plas 5.3. In 1981, the cylinder heads of the V12 engine were replaced by the new Fireball high-compression design by Swiss racing driver Michael May, and were badged from this time onwards to 1985 as &quot;HE&quot; (High Efficiency) models.

In late 1981, the Daimler Sovereign and Double Six models received a minor interior upgrade for the 1982 model year with features similar to Vanden Plas models. Also for the 1982 model year, a top spec Jaguar Vanden Plas model was introduced in the US market. In late 1982, the interior of all Series III models underwent a minor update for the 1983 model year. A trip computer appeared for the first time and was fitted as standard on V12 models. A new and much sought-after alloy wheel featuring numerous distinctive circular holes was also introduced, commonly known as the &quot;pepperpot&quot; wheel. Pirelli tyres were also fitted as standard equipment.

For the 1984 model year, the Sovereign name was transferred from the Daimler marque to a new top-specification Jaguar model, the Jaguar Sovereign. A base Jaguar XJ12 was no longer available, with the V12 engine only being offered as a Jaguar Sovereign HE or Daimler Double Six. The Vanden Plas name was also dropped at the time in the UK market, due to Jaguar being split from British Leyland and privatised; the name was used on top-of-the-range Rover-branded cars. Daimler models became the Daimler 4.2 and Double Six and were the most luxurious XJ Series III models, being fully optioned with Vanden Plas spec interiors. The Vanden Plas trademark was retained by Jaguar in North America, and top-of-the-line XJs were still sold there with the Vanden Plas name. The 1984 UK model range included the Jaguar XJ6 3.4 and 4.2, Sovereign 4.2 and 5.3, and Daimler 4.2 and Double Six 5.3.

Production of the six-cylinder Series III XJs continued until early 1987, after which it was replaced by the all-new XJ40, while production of 12-cylinder Series III XJs continued until 1992. The last 100 cars built were numbered and sold in Canada as part of a special series commemorating the end of production. These 100 cars featured the option of having a brass plaque located in the cabin. It was the original purchaser&#x27;s option to have this plaque, which also gave a number to the car, such as No. 5 of 100, fitted to the glove box, to the console woodwork or not fitted at all. This brass plaque initiative did not come from Jaguar in Coventry: it was a local effort by Jaguar Canada staff and the brass plaques were engraved locally.

132,952 Series III cars were built, 10,500 with the V12 engine. In total between 1968 and 1992 approximately 318,000 XJ6 and XJ12 cars were produced.

=== Technical specifications ===
==XJ40, X300, and X308 (1986–2003)==
The second generation of the XJ was produced for a total of 17 years with the arrival of the XJ40 in 1986 with its X300 and X308 derivatives being introduced later. 

===XJ40 (1986–1994)===
The intended replacement for the Series XJ models was code-named XJ40, and development on the all-new car began in the early 1970s (with small scale models being built as early as 1972). The project suffered a number of delays due to problems at parent company British Leyland and events such as the
1973 oil crisis. The XJ40 was finally unveiled on 8 October 1986 at the British International Motor Show.

With the XJ40, Jaguar began to place more emphasis on build quality as well as simplification of the XJ&#x27;s build process. With 25% fewer body panel pressings required versus the outgoing model, the new process also saved weight, increased the stiffness of the chassis, and reduced cabin noise.
The new platform came with significantly different styling, which was more squared-off and angular than the outgoing Series III. Individual round headlamps were replaced with rectangular units on the higher-specification cars, either 390mm millimetric tyres or 15&quot; wheels with 225/65R15 Pirelli Cinturato P5 tyres and all models came with only a single, wide-sweeping windshield wiper. The interior received several modernisations such as the switch to a digital instrument cluster, although this was eventually discontinued for the 1990 model year in favour of analogue instruments.

The six-cylinder XJ40s are powered by the AJ6 inline-six engine, which replaced the XK unit used in earlier XJs. The new unit featured a four-valve, twin overhead cam design. In 1993, one year before XJ40 production ended, the V12-powered XJ12 and Daimler Double Six models were reintroduced.
===X300 (1994–1997)===


The X300, introduced in October 1994 at the Paris Motor Show, was stylistically intended to evoke the image of the more curvaceous Series XJ models. The front of the car was redesigned significantly to return to four individual round headlamps that provided definition to the sculptured bonnet. Mechanically, it was similar to the XJ40 that it replaced.

Six-cylinder X300 models are powered by the AJ16 inline-six engine, which is a further enhancement of the AJ6 engine that uses an electronic distributorless ignition system. The V12 remained available until the end of the X300 production in 1997, although it ended one year earlier in the United States market due to problems meeting OBD-II-related emissions requirements. Jaguar first introduced the supercharged XJR model in the X300&#x27;s production run; the first supercharged road car manufactured by the company.

Design of the X300 was directly affected by Ford&#x27;s ownership of Jaguar (between 1990 and 2007). According to &quot;Automotive News&quot;, this was evident in general &quot;product development processes&quot;, more than the use of Ford components. The X300&#x27;s traction control system was obtained from the Ford Mondeo and it also featured a Denso air conditioner purchased through Ford channels. In a &quot;Car and Driver&quot;″s comparison test, it was stated that the X300 Jaguar XJ is less roomy than the E39 BMW 5 Series and W210 Mercedes-Benz E-Class despite being longer dimensionally.
===X308 (1997–2003)===

After the XJ40, Jaguar&#x27;s intention was to launch a brand new saloon with a new V8 engine. Ford halted development of the saloon, termed XJ90, and proposed to install its new engine and front and rear ends onto the centre section of the XJ40 model; however, the V8 was not ready until after the X308 model, and the X300 went on to become one of Jaguar&#x27;s most successful models. With the introduction of the X308 generation in 1997 came a switch from the XJ6 and XJ12 nomenclature to XJ8, reflecting the fact that the X308 cars were powered by a new V8 engine. The exterior styling of the X308 is similar to the X300 with minor refinements. The biggest change in the appearance was the switch to a stylistically rounded design for all of the exterior lights, indicators and interior trim and fittings, including information displays and switches.

The X308 kept much of the same exterior styling as its predecessor, carrying its rounded four-headlamp bonnet, low roofline, sloping tail, and wrap-around rear light clusters. From the front, the two generations can be differentiated by the shape of the indicator lenses (rectangular on the X300, oval on the X308), and also by the shape of the fog lamps and lower valance air intake, both of which are more rounded on the X308. The interior was updated to eliminate the rectangular instrument binnacle that had gone largely unchanged since the original XJ40; instead, three large gauges were set into recesses in the walnut-faced dashboard in front of the driver similar in design to the recently launched Jaguar XK (X100). The front and rear bumpers were both changed along with the taillights which had red/clear lenses rather than red/grey lenses. The grill surround and badging was slightly changed. The headlight fixtures also included forward parking lights housed with the brights, new to X308.
The biggest change to the interior on the X308 was to the dashboard, which had remained essentially the same since the original XJ40 with only detail changes over the years. The rectangular instrument binnacle gave way to three deeply recessed dials similar in style to the recently introduced Jaguar XK8. The new fascia also allowed for the restoration of a proper glove compartment, which had been lost when the original XJ40 dash had been retrofitted with a passenger side airbag. Door trim and the design of the center console were also slightly revised.

The major mechanical change was the replacement of both the inline-six and V12 engines with new eight-cylinder AJ-V8 in either a displacement of 3.2 L or 4.0 L, with the 4.0 L also available in supercharged form in the Jaguar XJR, a sport-oriented model. Certain markets, such as the United States, only received cars powered by the 4.0 L version. No manual transmission was available, and all X308 models were supplied with a five-speed automatic gearbox. Computer-controlled active suspension was available as a feature named Computer Active Technology Suspension (CATS).
==X350, X356, and X358 (2003–2009)==
=== XJ (X350) (2003–2005) ===

In 2003, Jaguar introduced the re-engineered and newly designed third generation of the XJ, continuing with the XJ8 model designation. Designated internally as the X350, it featured an all-aluminium body and chassis, a new V8 engine, as well as greater interior and luggage spaces. It was the first Jaguar XJ to be completely designed under Ford ownership and used electronics and computer-controlled systems sourced through existing partner suppliers or directly produced by Ford. Just under 85,000 were manufactured over its seven year production run.

The V8 engine was offered in larger 3.5 and 4.2-litre displacements as well in a supercharged variation. A 3.0-litre V6 engine was also offered; neither the V6 petrol nor diesel engines were available in US markets. A new six-speed automatic gearbox was fitted which was lighter and offered better economy with lock-up on all gears and a larger spread of ratios.

Air suspension was fitted at the front and rear, providing adaptive damping as well as rear self leveling— with computer-controlled ride height and suspension mode. Dynamic stability control as well as traction control were standard. Radar based adaptive cruise control was offered. Two-zone climate control was also standard, with four-zone available on long-wheelbase models. An optional touch screen interface controlled default settings, satellite navigation, the Alpine audio system, and bluetooth telephone. Jaguar Voice offered voice control of many functions.
===XJ (X356) (2005–2007)===

The facelifted X350 debuted in 2005 for the model year 2006, with a revised front grille and with slightly redesigned front fenders. Some vehicle electronics systems were updated.

===XJ (X358) (2007–2009)===
Jaguar launched the X358 facelift to the X350 at the end of February 2007 with a revised lower grille, prominent faux side air vents, small bootlid spoiler, and revised seating.
A Jaguar emblem within the grille replaced the previous bonnet-mounted bonnet mascot. The front lights were revised and door mirrors incorporated side repeaters. The side sills, rear bumper, and taillights were revised. The interior featured redesigned front seats.
==X351 (2010–2019)==

In July 2009, the redesigned XJ was unveiled at the Saatchi Gallery in London, with Jay Leno and Elle Macpherson unveiling the new car. The unveiling was broadcast live on the Jaguar website.

In keeping with Ian Callum&#x27;s new design direction for Jaguar, the XJ has an all-new exterior design and a break from the XJ Series mould carried over on all previous generations. It is a longer, wider car that is much bigger than its predecessor. The front has clear links with the XF executive car, although with slimmer, sleeker lights and a larger, squarer grille add a more aggressive appearance. The rear is the contentious part, an unusual design element for a Jaguar automobile. The upright, swooping taillights, nicknamed &quot;cat&#x27;s claws&quot;, and black roof panels at each side of the rear screen, which aim to hide the XJ&#x27;s width, are the most striking aspects. There is also a standard full-length sunroof, that extends all the way back with just a single body-coloured roof panel that the designer refers as bridges on yachts. The new XJ features an innovative, all-LCD dashboard and console displays. The dashboard can be configured to display various virtual dials in addition to the obligatory speedometer. The console display presents different views to the driver and passenger, including control of a sophisticated video and audio system.

Like several of its predecessors, the X351 is available in both standard and long-wheelbase form, as well as many special editions. Engines are modern units already seen in other JLR products: the 5.0-litre petrol V8 either normally aspirated or supercharged, or a 3.0-litre diesel twin-turbocharged V6 that is predicted to account for most of the sales. For 2013, a 3.0-litre supercharged V6 was introduced to the line-up, primarily as an alternative to the diesel unit for improved fuel economy. The X351 received a minor facelift in 2014, primarily upgrading the suspension and rear seat facilities on the long wheelbase versions, but also introducing small cosmetic changes across the range, and making stop-start technology standard on all engines.

The X351 received another facelift in 2015, adding LED headlights, J-Blade rear taillights, and adding several new driver assistance and safety features such as lane assist, adaptive cruise control with a new feature known as &quot;Queue assist&quot;, reverse traffic direction, closing vehicle sensing, a 360 degree camera system, and semi-automated parking features.

The X351 is one of the cars used by the British royal family and an armoured car version was used for transporting three former British prime ministers, such as David Cameron, Theresa May, and Boris Johnson. The prime ministerial car, aside from having classified security measures, has armoured under plates and engine plates.

===Worldwide sales===

==Electric XJ (cancelled)==

On 5 July 2019, Jaguar Land Rover confirmed that they intended to build an all-electric XJ luxury saloon car at their Castle Bromwich plant. The car was expected to be launched in 2020. First official images of new generation&#x27;s taillights were shown. The taillights were shown and based on them the new generation was rendered again in 2020.

On 15 February 2021, Jaguar Land Rover announced that the all-electric XJ project had been shelved, as it was no longer part of the company&#x27;s current vision. The company said: &quot;Following a thorough technology review against the exponential change in the automotive industry, we concluded that the planned XJ replacement does not fit with our vision for a reimaged Jaguar brand.&quot;
==XJ numbering of cars and engines==
Just prior to World War II, Jaguar, known then as SS Cars, started using a numbering system beginning with the letter X for internal projects. X meaning experimental, XB for military chassis projects, and XF to XK for engines. This numbering system has never been consistent and there appear to be many omissions and duplications.

==Special uses==
The Jaguar XJ has been used by British prime ministers. Dating back to the Jaguar XJ (Series III), various versions of the XJ were used by Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, and Gordon Brown. On 11 May 2010, David Cameron took delivery of the dark grey car No. 10 Jaguar XJ (X351) Sentinel as his prime ministerial car. In 2011, Cameron took the delivery of another XJ Sentinel featuring bomb proof doors, bullet proof glass, and armoured plating beneath the floor of the car, respectively replacing the previous XJ Sentinel. The XJ Sentinel was used for transporting Theresa May, and was also used by Boris Johnson. Under Johnson, the XJ was replaced for the first time since 1979 by the Range Rover Abio Sentinel as the prime ministerial car in 2019.

<doc id="657877" wikidata="Q4273853" url="?curid=657877" title="Khoums">
<text>The khoums (singular and plural in English; ; ) is the subdivisory unit of the Mauritanian monetary system, the ouguiya. Five khoums make an ouguiya, hence one khoums can be expressed as 0.2 ouguiya.

When the ouguiya was adapted in 1973, it replaced the CFA franc as 5 francs to the ouguiya, thus a khoums was equal to the franc. As the franc had no subdivisional unit, all wealths in francs could be converted to ouigiya with no rounding. On the khoums coin (minted in Kremnica Mint, Slovakia), the obverse is in Arabic with the date of the Islamic calendar and the reverse in French in the Gregorian calendar with national arms on each side, identical to all other Mauritanian coins. However, on the Arabic side, instead of a number like on the other coins, the word is used.

The khoums is one of only two subdivisions of currency that are not in a multiple of ten, and the only one still in everyday use; the other is the Malagasy iraimbilanja, also based on the franc.

 the value of one khoums is about US$0.0054347846/¢0.54347846.

<doc id="657881" wikidata="Q5891957" url="?curid=657881" title="Hon Sui Sen">
<text>Benedict Hon Sui Sen (; 16 April 1916 – 14 October 1983) was a Singaporean politician who served as Minister for Finance between 1970 and 1983. A member of the governing People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP), he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Havelock Constituency between 1970 and 1983.

==Early life==
Hon was born in a Hakka Chinese family on 16 April 1916 in Penang in the British Straits Settlements. Educated at Saint Xavier&#x27;s Institution, he earned the top place in the 1932 Senior Cambridge Certificate Examination. In 1935, he commenced studies at Raffles College in Singapore and graduated in 1938 with a Class I Diploma in Science.

==Career==
After graduation, Hon entered the Straits Settlements Civil Service as a Police Court Magistrate. Following this, he assumed responsibilities as a Deputy Collector of Land Revenue prior to the Japanese occupation of Malaya and Singapore. After the War, Hon remained with the Land Office and by 1957 had become Land Commissioner. In 1960, Hon was attached to the World Bank for an economic management course, where he met Albert Winsemius. Winsemius led the United Nations Survey Mission to Singapore in late 1960 and played a major role in the formulation of Singapore&#x27;s national economic development strategy.

===Economic Development Board===
From 1961 to 1968, Hon returned to serve as the first Chairman of the Economic Development Board (EDB) and then from 1968 to 1970 as Chairman of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS).

As Chairman of the EDB, Hon played a key role in the implementation of Singapore&#x27;s industrialisation strategy, with the Jurong Industrial Estate (JIE) as the first major project. Sited on swamplands in the west of Singapore, the JIE soon became the centrepiece of an industrialisation programme that stretched from garments and toys to petrochemicals and electronics. The first factory in Jurong, the National Iron and Steel Mill, was opened on 2 August 1963. By 1968, there were about 300 factories employing 21,000 people in Jurong. In conjunction with the development of the industrial estate, satellite towns were built in the west of Singapore, transforming the Jurong area into a centre of both industrial and residential development.

===Singapore Institute of Management===
From 1965 to 1968, Hon was a council member of the Singapore Institute of Management.

===Development Bank of Singapore &amp; Intraco===
In 1968, Hon helped to spearhead the formation of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) and Intraco. During his time with DBS, Hon was a supporter of the establishment of the Asian dollar market and thus played a key role in the development of Singapore&#x27;s financial services industry.

==Political career==
In 1970, Hon succeeded Goh Keng Swee as Minister of Finance and served in that capacity for 13 years until 1983. In a letter by his daughter Joan many years after Hon&#x27;s passing, Joan wrote that Hon was drawing a salary of $10,000 per month at DBS before he became a Minister, a job that paid him $3,000 instead; by 1983 when he died, Hon received $14,000 in total per month.

In 1982, Hon was named the Economic Minister of the Year by &quot;Euromoney&quot;.

As Singapore&#x27;s Finance Minister, Hon established the Bases Economic Conversion Department to oversee the conversion and commercialisation of lands and facilities that had been left behind by the British military following their withdrawal in 1968. Hon also played a major role in the development of Singapore&#x27;s tourism industry, beginning with the transformation of Pulau Blakang Mati, a previously fortified island off the southern coast of Singapore, into a resort destination under the new appellation of Sentosa Island.

Hon was appointed as the chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) between 1971 and 1980.

==Awards==
Hon was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal in 1967.

== Legacy ==
The National University of Singapore&#x27;s Hon Sui Sen Memorial Library and Hon Sui Sen Drive in the campus are named after him. His office is also preserved within the library, while some of his legacy artefacts have been donated by family and put on showcase at the National Museum of Singapore as of December 2015.

==Personal life==
Hon was married to Annie and had four daughters.

Hon died of a heart attack on 14 October 1983 while still in office as Finance Minister.

<doc id="657884" wikidata="Q1740491" url="?curid=657884" title="Khalid Abdul Muhammad">
<text>Khalid Abdul Muhammad (born Harold Moore Jr.; January 12, 1948 – February 17, 2001) was an African-American Muslim minister and activist who became a prominent figure in the Nation of Islam and later the New Black Panther Party. After a racially inflammatory 1993 speech at Kean College, Muhammad was condemned and removed from his position in the Nation of Islam by Louis Farrakhan. He was also censured by both Houses of the United States Congress.

After being removed from the Nation of Islam, he served as the National Chairman of the New Black Panther Party until his death in 2001 from a brain aneurysm. He advocated black independence and stated a personal practice of anti-miscegenation.

== Early life ==
Harold Moore Jr. was raised by his aunt, Carrie Moore Vann, in Houston, Texas, where he attended Bruce Elementary School, E.O. Smith Junior High School, and all-black Phillis Wheatley High School. After graduating high school, Moore went to Dillard University in Louisiana, where he was known as Harold Vann, to pursue a degree in theological studies, but he did not graduate. At this time, he ministered at Sloan Memorial Methodist Church. In 1967, he was initiated into Omega Psi Phi fraternity (Theta Sigma chapter). Later, Moore transferred to Pepperdine University and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree.

==Nation of Islam==
In 1970, while attending Dillard, Moore joined the Nation of Islam, which was then under the leadership of Elijah Muhammad. He changed his name to Harold Smith or Harold X, then to Malik Rushaddin, became Minister Louis Farrakhan&#x27;s protégé, and was active as a recruiter within the organization. In 1978, Rushaddin was appointed Western Regional Minister of the Nation of Islam and leader of Mosque #27. In 1983, Minister Farrakhan named him Khalid after the Islamic general Khalid ibn al-Walid, a follower of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, calling him the Sword of Allah.

By 1984, Muhammad had become one of Louis Farrakhan&#x27;s most trusted advisors in the Nation of Islam. He traveled to Libya on a fund-raising trip, where he became well acquainted with that country&#x27;s leader, Muammar al-Gaddafi. Muhammad&#x27;s dedication to Farrakhan and to the message of the NOI eventually secured him the title of national spokesman and he was named one of Louis Farrakhan&#x27;s friends in 1981. He served at Nation of Islam mosques in New York and Atlanta throughout the 1980s. A federal court convicted him in 1987 of mortgage fraud and sentenced him to nine months in prison. After his prison term he returned to the Nation, becoming Farrakhan&#x27;s national advisor in 1991.

==1993 speech and aftermath==
In 1993, Muhammad gave a speech at Kean College in Union Township, New Jersey, in which Muhammad referred to Jews as &quot;bloodsuckers&quot; of the black community, labeled the Pope a &quot;no-good cracker,&quot; and advocated the murder of any and all white South Africans who would not leave the nation subsequent to a warning period of 24 hours. The United States Senate and United States House of Representatives both voted overwhelmingly to support resolutions condemning the speech. Farrakhan responded by publicly repudiating Muhammad&#x27;s speech. However, Minister Farrakhan specified that he opposed the &quot;tone&quot; of Muhammad&#x27;s speech, while acknowledging the &quot;truths&quot; in it. Despite this, Muhammad&#x27;s remarks also resulted in not only Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) members distancing themselves from the Nation of Islam, but also CBC chairman Kweisi Mfume, (D-MD), ending his relationship with the Nation of Islam as well. In September 1993, Mfume announced a &quot;covenant&quot; between the Nation of Islam and CBC members to work together on strengthening the black community after he had invited Farrakhan to address the black caucus’ annual legislative conference.

The day after Mfume held a press conference announcing his break with the Nation of Islam in February 1994, Farrakhan demoted Muhammad and also removed him as the NOI&#x27;s spokesman. He was silenced as a minister and suspended from the NOI soon afterward. In 1994, Muhammad appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. When asked how he felt about being condemned by the United States House of Representatives, Muhammad said: &quot;as a freedom fighter and a revolutionary, it is one of the greatest honors that could be paid.&quot; During the show he participated in heated arguments with white Jewish and non-Jewish audience members, amid explanations of his public statements.

Muhammad was shot by James Bess, a former NOI member, after he spoke at the University of California, Riverside on May 29, 1994. He survived the shooting. Muhammed himself, along with many others within the black nationalist community, believed the shooting was a part of a conspiracy.

==New Black Panther Party==
After being stripped of his position as NOI spokesman, Muhammad became the national chairman of the New Black Panther Party. On May 21, 1997, he delivered a heated speech at San Francisco State University in which he criticized Jews, whites, Catholics and homosexuals.

In 1998, Muhammad organized the &quot;Million Youth March&quot; in New York City which attracted an estimated 6,000 participants. New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani denied the organizers a permit, calling it a hate march. A court ruled that the event could go on but scaled back its duration and size. At the conclusion of the rally, just as Muhammad appeared on the stage to speak, the demonstration was interrupted by a low-flying police helicopter. Muhammad alleges that was the signal for more than 3,000 police in riot gear, including some mounted on horseback, to come in and disperse the crowd. In response, Muhammad exhorted the rally participants to attack the oncoming police, to beat them with rails, and to shoot them with their own guns. Dozens were arrested, and 30 officers and five civilians were injured. Mayor Giuliani said that the march turned out to be precisely what he predicted, &quot;filled with hatred, horrible, awful, vicious, anti-Semitic and other anti-white rhetoric, as well as exhortations to kill people, murder people ... the speeches given today should not occur [at] any place.&quot; Muhammad convened a second march in 1999.

In the year 2000, it was revealed that one of the contestants on the American version of the Dutch television show &quot;Big Brother&quot;, William Collins (Hiram Ashantee), was a follower of Muhammed.

== Musical influence ==
As a prominent Afrocentrist and speaker on African history, Muhammad attracted interest from several hip-hop artists, who sampled him in their songs. Public Enemy quoted him in the introduction of its 1988 track &quot;Night of the Living Baseheads&quot; from the album &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot;:

Have you forgotten that once we were brought here, we were robbed of our name, robbed of our language. We lost our religion, our culture, our god ... and many of us, by the way we act, we even lost our minds.

He also appeared on Ice Cube&#x27;s albums &quot;Death Certificate&quot; (1991) and &quot;Lethal Injection&quot; (1993) as a guest rapper. On the former album, Muhammad appeared in the tracks &quot;Death&quot; and &quot;The Birth&quot;. On the latter, he appeared in the song &quot;Cave Bitch&quot;, a song ridiculing white women. On the Scarface song &quot;Hand of the Dead Body&quot;, Ice Cube also mentioned Muhammad, saying &quot;Down with Kahlid Abdul Muhammad / Do he got a brother? I&#x27;m it now.&quot; On MC Ren&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;The Villain in Black&quot; Muhammad appeared in the track &quot;Muhammad Speaks&quot;, where he spoke about the history of the rights of African-Americans.

Musical references to Muhammad since his death include a quote of his &quot;Kill the White Man&quot; speech on The Used&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Artwork&quot;, a sample of his interview with Louis Theroux in the Chase &amp; Status song &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, and excerpts from a recording of one of his speeches concerning Jesus in the D&#x27;Angelo song &quot;1000 Deaths&quot; on the 2014 album &quot;Black Messiah&quot;.

==Personal life==
Muhammad had five children, including Farrah Gray, who grew up in Chicago&#x27;s South Side. Although Gray saw his father only during occasional visits, he credits Muhammad for inspiring him with confidence. Gray rose from poverty to become a successful business entrepreneur, but did not join his father&#x27;s political activities.

==Death==
In 2001, Muhammad died unexpectedly of a brain aneurysm in Atlanta, Georgia, at the age of 53. He was buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in Westchester County, New York, near the grave of Malcolm X.

<doc id="657897" wikidata="Q204225" url="?curid=657897" title="Zina">
<text>Zināʾ () or zinā ( or ) is an Islamic legal term referring to unlawful sexual intercourse. According to traditional jurisprudence, &quot;zina&quot; can include adultery, fornication, prostitution, sodomy, incest, and bestiality. &quot;Zina&quot; must be proved by testimony of four Muslim eyewitnesses to the actual act of penetration, confession repeated four times and not retracted later. The offenders must have acted of their own free will. Rapists could be prosecuted under different legal categories which used normal evidentiary rules. Making an accusation of &quot;zina&quot; without presenting the required eyewitnesses is called &quot;qadhf&quot; (), which is itself a &quot;hudud&quot; offense.

There are very few recorded examples of the stoning penalty for &quot;zinā&quot; being implemented legally. Prior to legal reforms introduced in several countries during the 20th century, the procedural requirements for proving the offense of &quot;zinā&quot; to the standard necessary to impose the stoning penalty were effectively impossible to meet.

&quot;Zina&quot; became a more pressing issue in modern times, as Islamist movements and governments employed polemics against public immorality. In recent decades several countries passed legal reforms that incorporated elements of hudud laws into their legal codes, and many modern Islamists have also disregarded the condition of strict evidence requirements. In Nigeria, local courts have passed several stoning sentences, all of which were overturned on appeal or left unenforced. In Pakistan, the Hudood Ordinances of 1979 subsumed prosecution of rape under the category of &quot;zina&quot;, making rape extremely difficult to prove and exposing the victims to jail sentences for admitting illicit intercourse forced upon them, although these laws were amended in 2006, and again in 2016. According to human rights organizations, stoning to death for &quot;zina&quot; has also been carried out in Saudi Arabia. &quot;Zina&quot; and rape are two different crimes under Islamic Law. Ordinances like the Hudood Ordinances are not Islamic, in terms of rape and &quot;zina.&quot;

==Islamic scriptures==
Muslim scholars have historically considered &quot;zinā&quot; a &quot;hudud&quot; sin, or crime against God. It is mentioned in both Quran and in the Hadiths.

===Introduction and definition===
The Quran deals with &quot;zina&quot;ʾ in several places. First is the Qur&#x27;anic general rule that commands Muslims not to commit &quot;zina&quot;:
In the Hadiths, the definitions of &quot;zina&quot; have been described as all the forms of sexual intercourse, penetrative or non-penetrative, outside of marriage.

===Adultery and fornication===
====Quran====

Stoning punishment, a form of capital punishment for adultery, is not mentioned in the canonical text of the Quran.
Most of the rules related to fornication, adultery and false accusations from a husband to his wife or from members of the community to chaste women, can be found in Surah an-Nur (the Light). The surah starts by giving very specific rules about punishment for &quot;zina&quot;:

According to Jonathan A.C. Brown, Surah an-Nisa verse 4:25 prescribes punishment for a female slave guilty of a sexual offense as half of the punishment of a free woman:

====Hadith====

The public lashing punishment for fornication and adultery are also prescribed in Hadiths, the books most trusted in Islam after Quran, particularly in &quot;Kitab Al-Hudud&quot;.

Hadith Sahih al Bukhari, another authentic source of sunnah, has several entries which refer to death by stoning. For example,

Other hadith collections on &quot;zina&quot; between men and woman include:
* The stoning (Rajm) of a Jewish man and woman for having committed illegal sexual intercourse.
* Abu Hurairah states that the Prophet, in a case of intercourse between a young man and a married woman, sentenced the woman to stoning and the young man to flogging and banishment for a year. (Sahih Muslim 17:4209) 

===Rape===
Rape has been defined as &quot;zina al-jabr&quot; (forceful illicit sex) in the traditional Islamic texts. Few hadiths have been found regarding rape in the time of Muhammad. The most popular transmitted hadith given below indicates the ordinance of stoning for the rapist but no punishment and no requirement of four eyewitnesses for the rape victim.


The hadiths declare rape of a free or slave woman as &quot;zina&quot;.

====View of scholars====


If a confession or the four witnesses required to prove a &quot;hadd&quot; crime are not available, but rape can be proved by other means, the rapist is sentenced under the &quot;ta&#x27;zir&quot; system of judicial discretion. According to the eleventh-century Maliki jurist Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Barr:

===Homosexuality===

Islamic teachings (in the &quot;hadith&quot; tradition) presume same-sex attraction, extol abstention and (in the Qur&#x27;an) condemn consummation. 
There are no reports relating to homosexuality in the best known and authentic hadith collections of &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; and &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot;, other canonical collections record a number of condemnations of the &quot;act of the people of Lut&quot; (male-to-male anal intercourse). Some Quranic verses are used to propose a prohibition of homosexual activities, including:

In another verse, the statement of prophet Lot has been also pointed out,
Some scholars indicate this verse as the prescribed punishment for homosexuality in the Quran:
However, there are different interpretations of the last verse where who the Quran refers to as &quot;two among you&quot;. Pakistani scholar Javed Ahmed Ghamidi sees it as a reference to premarital sexual relationships between men and women. In his opinion, the preceding Ayat of Sura Nisa deals with prostitutes of the time. He believes these rulings were temporary and were abrogated later when a functioning state was established and society was ready for permanent rulings, which came in Sura Nur, Ayat 2 and 3, prescribing flogging as a punishment for adultery. He does not see stoning as a prescribed punishment, even for married men, and considers the Hadiths quoted supporting that view to be dealing with either rape or prostitution, where the strictest punishment under Islam for spreading &quot;fasad fil ardh&quot;, meaning corruption in the land, referring to egregious acts of defiance to the rule of law was carried out.

Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali jurists insist that anal sex between men is a hudud crime punished with death, however Hanafi jurists argue that the act is immoral and forbidden but does not qualify as a hudud violation.

The Hadiths consider homosexuality as &quot;zina&quot;. For example, Abu Dawud state,
The discourse on homosexuality in Islam is primarily concerned with activities between men. There are, however, a few hadith mentioning homosexual behavior in women; The jurists are agreed that &quot;there is no hadd punishment for lesbianism, because it is not zina. Rather a ta’zeer punishment must be imposed, because it is a sin..&#x27;&quot;. Although punishment for lesbianism is rarely mentioned in the histories, al-Tabari records an example of the casual execution of a pair of lesbian slavegirls in the harem of al-Hadi, in a collection of highly critical anecdotes pertaining to that Caliph&#x27;s actions as ruler. Some jurists viewed sexual intercourse as possible only for an individual who possesses a phallus; hence those definitions of sexual intercourse that rely on the entry of as little as the corona of the phallus into a partner&#x27;s orifice. Since women do not possess a phallus and cannot have intercourse with one another, they are, in this interpretation, physically incapable of committing &quot;zina&quot;.

=== Anal sex ===

All Sunni Muslim jurists agree that anal sex is haram (prohibited), based on the hadith of Muhammad. In contrast, according to Twelver Shia Muslim jurists, anal sex is considered makruh (strongly disliked) but is permissible with the consent of the wife.

Many scholars point to the story of Lot in the Quran as an example of sodomy being an egregious sin. However multiple others hold the view that the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was not specifically due to the sodomy practiced in those towns, but as a combination of multiple transgressions. The death by stoning for people of Sodom and Gomorrah is similar to the stoning punishment stipulated for illegal heterosexual sex. There is no punishment for a man who sodomizes a woman because it is not tied to procreation. However, other jurists insist that any act of lust in which the result is the injecting of semen into another person constitutes sexual intercourse.

Sodomy often falls under that same category as sex between an unmarried man and woman engaging in sexual acts. Male-male intercourse is referred to as &quot;liwat&quot; while female-female intercourse is referred to as &quot;sihaq&quot;. Both are considered reprehensible acts but there is no consensus on punishment for either. Some jurists define &quot;zināʾ&quot; exclusively as the act of unlawful vaginal penetration, hence categorizing and punishing anal penetration in different ways. Other jurists included both vaginal and anal penetration within the definition of &quot;zināʾ&quot; and hence extended the punishment of the one to the other.

Religious discourse has mostly focused on such sexual acts, which are unambiguously condemned. The Quran refers explicitly to male-male sexual relations only in the context of the story of Lot, but labels the Sodomites&#x27;s actions (universally understood in the later tradition as anal intercourse) an &quot;abomination&quot; (female-female relations are not addressed). Reported pronouncements by Muhammad (&quot;hadith&quot;) reinforce the interdiction on male-male sodomy, although there are no reports of his ever adjudicating an actual case of such an offence; he is also quoted as condemning cross-gender behaviour for both sexes and banishing them from local places, but it is unclear to what extent this is to be understood as involving sexual relations. Several early caliphs, confronted with cases of sodomy between males, are said to have had both partners executed, by a variety of means. While taking such precedents into account, medieval jurists were unable to achieve a consensus on this issue; some legal schools prescribed capital punishment for sodomy, but others opted only for a relatively mild discretionary punishment. There was general agreement, however, that other homosexual acts (including any between females) were lesser offences, subject only to discretionary punishment.

===Incest===
Hadith forbids incestuous relationship (&quot;zinā bi&#x27;l-mahārim&quot;), sexual intercourse between someone who is mahram and prescribes execution as punishment.

===Masturbation===
Islamic scripture does not specifically mention masturbation. Like most people prior to the morals of the Age of Enlightenment, pre-modern Islam faced masturbation mostly with indifference. A few &quot;hadiths&quot; underline this view. Muhammad is reported to have said that &quot;it is your fluid, or your member, so do whatever you like, as it were.&quot; There are a few &quot;hadiths&quot; demonizing masturbation but these are classified as unreliable.

To prohibit masturbation scholars (ulama) of &quot;fiqh&quot; (Islamic jurisprudence) may have invoked the Qur&#x27;anic proclamation (Quran 23:1-6) that Muslims must protect their sexual organs, except from their legal spouses (&quot;azwājihim&quot;) or what their right hands own. The Mālikīs jurists follow suit and seem to categorically prohibit masturbation. Abū Bakr b. al-ʿArabī goes as far as to demonize this practise, stating that it was introduced by &quot;šayṭān&quot; (devil). Imam al-Shafi&#x27;i states that male masturbation (&quot;istimmā″&quot;) runs afoul of the Qur&#x27;anic proclamation (Quran 23:1-6) that Muslims must protect their sexual organs, except from their legal spouses (&quot;azwājihim&quot;) or what their right hands own. The Shafi&#x27;i school agree with the Mālikīs, and some of them consider masturbation a lesser form of &quot;zinā&quot;. The founder al-Shafi&#x27;i argued that this encourages men to neglect their wives and may cause the termination of family lineage.

The Ḥanafīs have mixed opinions. Most of them are rather critical about, but generally allow for unmarried people, and even obligatory if the alternative is illicit sex. Similarly, diverse are opinions among the Ḥanbalīs. Ibn Taimiyya&#x27;s statement, a proto-Salaf Hanbalite scholar, that the consensus of early and later jurists (salafan wa-ḫalafan) was to categorically prohibit masturbation, is clearly an overstatement. Due to a lack of concern about masturbation from Quran and &quot;hadiths&quot;, Ḥanbalīs generally disliked (&quot;makrūh&quot;), but not forbid masturbation. However, if one couldn&#x27;t find a spouse, one would be encouraged to masturbate.

Those who didn&#x27;t adhere to any of these four major schools are often going into more detail. Ibn Ḥazm explains that &quot;a woman who rubs something against herself (without inserting it) until she climaxes is not guilty of sin; the same is true of a man who masturbates. No scholar, he points out, disagrees that it is perfectly lawful for a person to touch their sex organ (specifying the use of the left hand for men), and since no scriptural text explicitly prohibits masturbation, it must be lawful&quot;. However, he adds that it is not appropriate for civilized people to do this.

===Bestiality===
According to hadith, bestiality is defined under &quot;zina&quot; and its punishment is execution of the accused man or woman along with the animal.

==Inclusions in the definition==
Technically, &quot;zina&quot; only refers to the act of penetration, while non-penetrative sex acts outside of marriage were censured by Muhammad as that which can lead to &quot;zina&quot;.

According to Sharia, the punishment for &quot;zina&quot; varies according to whether the offender is &quot;muhsan&quot; (adult, free, Muslim and married at least once) or not &quot;muhsan&quot; (i.e. a minor, a slave, a non-Muslim or never married). A person only qualifies as &quot;muhsan&quot; if he or she meets all of the criteria. The punishment for an offender who is &quot;muhsan&quot; is stoning. (&quot;rajm&quot;); the punishment for an offender who is not &quot;muhsan&quot; is 100 lashes. 
==Accusation process and punishment==
Islamic law requires evidence before a man or a woman can be punished for &quot;zina&quot;. These are:

#A Muslim confesses to &quot;zina&quot; four separate times. However, if the confessor takes back his words before the punishment is enforced or during the punishment, he/she will be released and set free. The confessor is in fact encouraged to take back their confession.
#Four free adult male Muslim witnesses of proven integrity. They must testify that they observed the couple engaged in unlawful sexual intercourse without any doubt or ambiguity. They are able to say that they saw their private parts meet &quot;like the Kohl needle entering the Kohl bottle.&quot;
# Unlike witnesses in most other circumstances, they are neither legally nor morally obliged to testify, and in fact legal texts state that it is morally better if they don&#x27;t.
# If any of the witnesses take back their testimony before the actual punishment is enforced, then the punishment will be abandoned, and the witnesses will be punished for the crime of false accusation.
# The witnesses must give their testimony at the earliest opportunity.
# If the offense is punished by stoning to death, the witnesses must throw the stones.

If a pregnant woman confesses that her baby was born from an illegal relationship then she will be subject to conviction in the Islamic courts. In cases where there are no witnesses and no confession then the woman will not receive punishment just because of pregnancy. Women can fall pregnant without committing illegal sexual intercourse. A woman could be raped or coerced. In this case, she is a victim and not the perpetrator of a crime. Therefore, she cannot be punished or even accused of misconduct merely on the strength of her falling pregnant.

The four witnesses requirement for &quot;zina&quot; is revealed by Quranic verses 24:11 through 24:13 and various hadiths. The testimony of women and non-Muslims is not admitted in cases of &quot;zina&quot; or in other &quot;hadd&quot; crimes.

Any witness to or victim of non-consensual sexual intercourse, who accuses a Muslim of &quot;zina&quot;, but fails to produce four adult, pious male eyewitnesses before a sharia court, commits the crime of false accusation (&quot;Qadhf&quot;, القذف), punishable with eighty lashes in public.

These requirements made &quot;zina&quot; virtually impossible to prove in practice. Hence, there are very few recorded examples of stoning for &quot;zina&quot; being legally carried out. In the 623-year history of the Ottoman Empire, the best-documented and most well-known pre-modern Islamic legal system, there is only one recorded example of the stoning punishment being applied for &quot;zina&quot;, when a Muslim woman and her Jewish lover were convicted of &quot;zina&quot; in 1680 and sentenced to death, the woman by stoning and the man by beheading. This was a miscarriage of justice according to the standards of Islamic law: adequate evidence was not produced, and the correct penalty for non-Muslims was 100 lashes rather than death.

Some schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) created the principle of &quot;shubha&quot; (doubt). According to this principle, if there is room for doubt in the perpetrator&#x27;s mind about whether the sexual act was illegal, he or she should not receive the hadd penalty, but could receive a less severe punishment at the discretion of the judge. Jurists had varying opinions on what counted as legitimate &quot;doubt&quot; for this purposes. A typical example is a man who has sex with his wife&#x27;s or his son&#x27;s slave. This is &quot;zina&quot; - a man can lawfully have sex only with his own slave. But a man might plausibly believe that he had ownership rights over his wife&#x27;s or his son&#x27;s property, and so think that having sex with their slaves was legal. The Ḥanafī jurists of the Ottoman Empire applied the concept of doubt to exempt prostitution from the hadd penalty. Their rationale was that since legal sex is legitimized, in part, by payment (the dower paid by the husband to the wife upon marriage, or the purchase price of a slave), a man might plausibly believe that prostitution, which also involves a payment in return for sexual access, was legal. This principle did not mean that such acts were treated as legal: they remained offenses, and could be punished, but they were not liable for the hadd penalty of 100 lashes or stoning.

===Sunni practice===
Persons who are not &quot;muhsan&quot; (i.e. a slave, a minor, never married) are punished for &quot;zina&quot; with one hundred lashes in public.

Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence considers pregnancy as sufficient and automatic evidence, unless there is evidence of rape. Other Sunni schools of jurisprudence rely on early Islamic scholars that state that a fetus can &quot;sleep and stop developing for 5 years in a womb&quot;, and thus a woman who was previously married but now divorced may not have committed &quot;zina&quot; even if she delivers a baby years after her divorce. They also argue that the woman may have been forced or coerced (see section above, &#x27;Accusation process and punishment&#x27;). The position of modern Islamic scholars varies from country to country. For example, in Malaysia which officially follows the Shafi&#x27;i fiqh, Section 23(2) through 23(4) of the Syariah (Sharia) Criminal Offences (Federal Territories) Act 1997 state,

Minimal proof for &quot;zina&quot; is still the testimony of four male eyewitnesses, even in the case of homosexual intercourse.

Prosecution of extramarital pregnancy as &quot;zina&quot;, as well as prosecution of rape victims for the crime of &quot;zina&quot;, have been the source of worldwide controversy in recent years.

===Shi&#x27;a practice===
Again, minimal proof for &quot;zina&quot; is the testimony of four male eyewitnesses. The Shi&#x27;is, however, also allow the testimony of women, if there is &quot;at least one male witness&quot;, testifying together with &quot;six women&quot;. All witnesses must have seen the act in its most intimate details, i.e. the penetration (like &quot;a stick disappearing in a kohl container,&quot; as the fiqh books specify). If their testimonies do not satisfy the requirements, they can be sentenced to eighty lashes for unfounded accusation of fornication (). If the accused freely admits the offense, the confession must be repeated &quot;four&quot; times, just as in Sunni practice. Pregnancy of a single woman is also sufficient evidence of her having committed &quot;zina&quot;.

==Human rights controversy==

The &quot;zina&quot; and rape laws of countries under Sharia law are the subjects of a global human rights debate.

Hundreds of women in Afghan jails are victims of rape or domestic violence. This has been criticized as leading to &quot;hundreds of incidents where a woman subjected to rape, or gang rape, was eventually accused of zināʾ&quot; and incarcerated.
Iran has prosecuted many cases of &quot;zina&quot;, and enforced public stoning to death of those accused between 2001 and 2010.

&quot;Zina&quot; laws are one of many items of reform and secularization debate with respect to Islam. In the early 20th century, under the influence of the colonial era, many penal laws and criminal justice systems were reformed away from Sharia in Muslim-majority parts of the world. By contrast, in the second half of the 20th century, after respective independence, a number of governments including Pakistan, Malaysia and Iran have reverted to Sharia with traditional interpretations of Islam&#x27;s sacred texts. &quot;Zina&quot; and hudud laws have been re-enacted and enforced.

Contemporary human right activists refer this as a new phase in the politics of gender in Islam, the battle between forces of traditionalism and modernism in the Muslim world, and the use of religious texts of Islam through state laws to sanction and practice gender-based violence.

In contrast to human rights activists, Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider &#x27;universal human rights&#x27; arguments as impositions of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and sexual codes that are central to Islam. &quot;Zina&quot; laws come under hudud seen as a crime against Allah; the Islamists refer to this pressure and proposals to reform &quot;zina&quot; and other laws as contrary to Islam. Attempts by international human rights to reform religious laws and codes of Islam has become the Islamist rallying platforms during political campaigns.

<text>Gilbert Theodore Fox (November 29, 1915 – May 15, 2004) was an American political cartoonist, comic book artist and editor, and animator.

==Biography==
Fox began his career in animation at Max Fleischer&#x27;s studio, but left due to labor unrest associated with a 1937 strike. He entered the comic book industry, working for a number of studios and companies, including DC Comics. During this period he was an editor and a cover artist for Quality Comics, with his work gracing the covers of such titles as &quot;Torchy&quot; and &quot;Plastic Man&quot;. In 1941, he wrote several weeks of continuity for the &quot;Spirit&quot; daily newspaper strip. A 1941 comic book written by Gill Fox, describing a German attack on Pearl Harbor, was published one month before the real-life Japanese attack on that U.S. naval base.

He left his editorial position at Quality in 1943 to serve in World War II, where he worked for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. Once discharged from military service, Fox freelanced for Quality Comics until the early 1950s.

Fox later moved to advertising, working for the Johnstone and Cushing advertising agency. There he met Dik Browne, and assisted him on Browne&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Hi and Lois&quot;. He also assisted/ghosted on several other strips as favors to friends.

Fox later worked as a political cartoonist for the Connecticut newspapers &quot;The Fairfield Citizen&quot; and the &quot;Connecticut Post&quot;; he was nominated for two Pulitzer Prizes. In the late 1980s, Fox created illustrations of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that were used on many licensed products. 

He died in Redding Ridge, Connecticut, at age 88.

== Personal life and family ==
Fox was the brother of the illustrator Lorraine Fox.

Circa 1940, Gill Fox married Helen Fittipaldi, who died in 1998. They had two children, daughters Donna Morency and Susan Fox.

<doc id="657901" wikidata="Q1359158" url="?curid=657901" title="Jamie Whitten">
<text>Jamie Lloyd Whitten (April 18, 1910September 9, 1995) was an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who represented his native state of Mississippi in the United States House of Representatives from 1941 to 1995. He was at the time of his departure the longest-serving U.S. Representative ever. From 1979 to 1995, he was Dean of the U.S. House of Representatives. He is the longest-serving member of Congress ever from Mississippi. He was a New Deal liberal on economic matters, and took a leading role in Congress in forming national policy and spending regarding agriculture. Whitten was the last remaining member of Congress to have served during the FDR administration.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Jamie Whitten was born in Cascilla, Mississippi. He attended local public schools and the University of Mississippi where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He worked as a school teacher and principal and was elected as a Democrat to the Mississippi House of Representatives, where he served in 1931 and 1932. He was admitted to the bar in 1932, and from 1933 to 1941, he was District Attorney of Mississippi&#x27;s 17th District, which included his home county of Tallahatchie.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

In 1941, Whitten was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in a special election to represent the state&#x27;s 2nd District, in the northern part of the state. The seat had become vacant as a result of incumbent Congressman Wall Doxey&#x27;s election to the United States Senate. He was elected to a full term in 1942 and was re-elected 25 more times.

Whitten&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 1st District after the 1970 Census.

===Tenure as leader in agricultural policy===
Whitten had the support of the Democratic caucus and served as chair of the Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture (1949-1953 and 1954-1978). He was chair of the entire committee 1979-1992. Throughout that period he had a decisive voice on agricultural spending and to a large extent on policies.
In 1977, his subcommittee lost control of environmental issues. He lost his influence after suffering a debilitating stroke in February 1992. As a champion for American farmers, he fought against the FDA&#x27;s early 1970s recommendation of restricting the use of antibiotics in livestock. He required that scientists prove the danger of antibiotic use.

Whitten was an ardent New Dealer who supported most liberal spending issues. He supported distribution of free food to the poor from surplus commodity stocks, school lunch programs and food stamps in coalition with urban Democrats. In the 1980s, he clashed with the conservative Reagan administration on policy matters. He voted against Reagan&#x27;s economic plans, tax cuts, increased defense spending, balanced budget initiative, tort reform, welfare reform, abortion restrictions, missile defense system, and the Persian Gulf War. Although Whitten represented a district that grew increasingly suburban and Republican-leaning from the 1970s onward, his opposition to Reagan&#x27;s program did not affect him at the ballot box. Indeed, his seniority and popularity resulted in his facing only token, or &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot;, opponents on the occasions he faced any opposition at all, even in years when Republican presidential candidates carried the district by landslide margins. Nonetheless, it was assumed that he would be succeeded by a Republican when he retired.

=== Record on racial issues ===
Whitten was originally a segregationist, as were many of his colleagues from Mississippi and the rest of the South. He signed the Southern Manifesto condemning the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which ordered the desegregation of public schools. Along with virtually the entire Mississippi congressional delegation, he voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 24th Amendment to the Constitution. Whitten later apologized for these votes, calling them a &quot;mistake&quot; caused by severe misjudgment. He voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1991.

=== Committees ===
Throughout most of his tenure in the House, Whitten served on the Appropriations Committee, ultimately serving as chairman from the 1979 retirement of George H. Mahon until newly-elected Democrats in the House Democratic Caucus removed him in favor of William Huston Natcher after the 1992 election. In 1985, when then-junior Appropriations Committee member Dick Durbin spoke with Chairman Whitten about possibly sitting on the Budget Committee, Whitten told him, &quot;Well, if you want to be on that committee, you can be on that committee, but I want you to remember one thing, the Budget Committee deals in hallucinations and the Appropriations Committee deals in facts.&quot; While on the floor of the Senate on March 21, 2018, now Senator Durbin referred to that quote from Whitten as &quot;Whitten&#x27;s Law,&quot; which implies that the Budget Committee is a political branch that makes budget promises while the Appropriations Committee is obliged to either make or break those promises during the budget-making process.

=== Retirement from the House ===

Declining to run for reelection to a historic 28th term in 1994, Whitten retired from the House as America&#x27;s longest-serving Congressman (53 years and two months). He retired to his home in Oxford, Mississippi and died there on September 9, 1995, aged 85. His service from November 4, 1941, to January 3, 1995 set a record for length of service in the House, which remained unbroken until February 11, 2009, when Michigan Rep. John Dingell surpassed it. Whitten is also the 5th longest-serving Congressmember (House and/or Senate) behind Dingell, Daniel Inouye, Carl Hayden, and Robert Byrd.

==Publications==
Whitten authored &quot;That We May Live&quot;, written largely as a pro-development, pro-chemical pesticide answer to Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, the seminal 1962 book that helped spur the modern environmental movement.

==Legacy and honors==
The Jamie Whitten Historical Site is located at the bridge of the Natchez Trace Parkway over the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, two projects that Whitten had successfully fought to fund over his house tenure, overcoming strong opposition from conservatives to their construction using federal funds.

In June 1995, Congress renamed the main headquarters building of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. the Jamie L. Whitten Building in his honor.

The Beta Beta chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity at the University of Mississippi has named their leadership award after brother Whitten. Each year, one graduating brother is selected to receive the award based on his leadership and commitment to the chapter, university, and community.

<text>Christina Milian ( , Flores; born September 26, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and entrepreneur. Following a number of minor television and film roles in the late nineties, Milian made her recording debut on American rapper Ja Rule&#x27;s 2000 single, &quot;Between Me and You&quot;, which peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

Under Island Records, she released her 2001 debut single &quot;AM to PM&quot;, which became a US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 40 single. In 2002, she performed the theme song &quot;Call Me, Beep Me!&quot;, for the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Kim Possible&quot;. Following a series of delays, her first album, &quot;Christina Milian&quot;, was only released internationally in 2002, where it charted moderately. Her second album, &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; (2004), spawned the number 5 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit &quot;Dip It Low&quot; (featuring Fabolous). Her third album, &quot;So Amazin&#x27;&quot; (2006) yielded the US top 40 single, &quot;Say I&quot; (featuring Jeezy). Milian experienced particular success in the UK, where each of her singles released under Island charted within the top 10. She parted ways with Island following the release of &quot;So Amazin&quot;&#x27; and independently released her first extended play, &quot;4U&quot;, in 2015.

As an actress, her first lead film role was in &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing&quot; (2003). She subsequently had lead roles in the films &quot;Be Cool&quot; (2005), &quot;Pulse&quot; (2006), and in the direct-to-DVD film &quot;Bring It On: Fight to the Finish&quot; (2009). Milian also starred in the ABC Family Original Movie &quot;Christmas Cupid&quot; (2010). From 2015 to 2016, she starred in the sitcom &quot;Grandfathered&quot;. MiliaI also co-founded and co-owns Beignet Box, a dessert shop in the Los Angeles area.

==Early life==
Milian (Milián in Spanish) was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and is of Afro-Cuban descent. Her parents are Don Flores and Carmen Milian.

Flores changed her name and adopted her mother&#x27;s maiden name (Milian) in the hopes of landing a wider range of acting roles. The oldest of three sisters, including Danielle and Elizabeth, she moved with her family to Waldorf, Maryland, soon after her birth. Milian was four years old when she showed an interest in show business, and when her family realized that she was a talented actress, she became determined to pursue an entertainment career. As a child, Milian was &quot;very imaginative and very creative&quot;, and watching television and listening to the radio became her life. They inspired her to have fun, and she convinced her parents that she &quot;did not want to be inside the TV&quot;, although it took some time to convince them. By the time she was nine years old, Milian had begun auditioning with local talent agencies, shot commercials for Wendy&#x27;s and Honeycomb, and played the lead role in the musical &quot;Annie&quot;. Milian&#x27;s mother noticed her daughter&#x27;s potential and left her husband and moved to Los Angeles with her three daughters when Milian was 13 years old. Her father had to stay in Maryland and divorced her mother soon after the move.

When Milian moved to Los Angeles, her only desire was to be an actress. She always wanted to be in the record business, but did not know how to obtain a recording contract. During this time, she was a host for Disney Channel&#x27;s series &quot;Movie Surfers&quot;, by the name of Tina. After living in Los Angeles for six months, Milian moved into the same apartment complex as songwriter and producer Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, who (like Milian) was also born in New Jersey. Jerkins heard about Milian from a boy band he was working with and once he heard her sing, they began working together. For a year and a half, Milian went into a studio every day and worked with Jerkins, which is where she started meeting people in the record business. She began writing songs at the age of 17 because she needed a demo to help her obtain a recording contract. According to Milian, every time she recorded a song, the producer would refuse to give her the demo, or would write lyrics that she did not agree with. She felt that she had to write a song, record a demo, and send it out on her own.

==Career==

===2000–2002: &quot;Christina Milian&quot;, record deal and acting debut===
Milian&#x27;s first major acting role was offered by the Disney Channel to join &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;; however, she did not accept and opted to star as a reporter on &quot;Movie Surfers&quot;. During this time, she had minor roles in film and television, including &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;, &quot;Smart Guy&quot;, &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;, &quot;Get Real&quot;, &quot;The Wood&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot;. Milian made her first professional musical appearance on rapper Ja Rule&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Rule 3:36&quot; (2000), performing vocals on the song &quot;Between Me and You&quot;. The song was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in 2000, peaking at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and in the top 30 of the UK Singles Chart. Milian co-wrote and performed vocals for the track &quot;Play&quot; for Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s album &quot;J. Lo&quot; (2001), and co-wrote &quot;Same Ol&#x27; Same Ol&#x27;&quot;, the second single from girl group PYT&#x27;s debut album &quot;PYT (Down with Me)&quot; (2001).

Milian&#x27;s collaboration with Ja Rule led to a record deal with Def Soul Records, prompted by his affiliation with Murder Inc. Records, an imprint that was distributed through Def Jam, the parent label of Def Soul Records. She travelled to Sweden and recorded her self-titled debut album. The album was released outside North America on January 23, 2002, reaching number 23 in the UK. The album&#x27;s domestic release was canceled, primarily due to the September 11 attacks. Two singles were taken from the album, &quot;AM to PM&quot; and &quot;When You Look at Me&quot;, both of which charted worldwide. A music video for the track &quot;Get Away&quot; was filmed in Paris, although it was not officially released as a single. Critical response to the album was generally mixed to positive. In the following years, she was featured on the track &quot;It&#x27;s All Gravy&quot;, a duet with British rapper Romeo, which peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Milian&#x27;s third top ten hit in Britain as a credited artist, and fourth overall; provided the theme song for the hit Disney Channel animated series &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, &quot;Call Me, Beep Me!&quot;; and collaborated with Hilary Duff on the song &quot;I Heard Santa on the Radio&quot; for Duff&#x27;s debut album &quot;Santa Claus Lane&quot; (2002).

In 2002, Milian was appointed the host of the live competitive music series &quot;Becoming Presents: Wannabe&quot; on MTV, where she met director Joseph Kahn. Kahn suggested she audition for a lead role in the film &quot;Torque&quot;. Her audition was successful and she played a supporting role in the film. She was subsequently cast in her first lead role in &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing&quot;.

===2003–2004: &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; and continued acting===
Milian felt that Island Def Jam was confused as to how they wanted her image to be portrayed. In 2003, Milian&#x27;s label, Def Soul, later shifted its focus into R&amp;B veterans under its Def Soul Classics faction; Def Soul would later be folded into its parent, Def Jam, in 2011. However, Milian would later be drafted to sister label Island Records. After the international release of her debut album, Milian went back into the recording studio. The singer felt that music trends had changed into rock music, hardcore hip hop and tribute songs, and her music did not fall into those categories. Milian decided to stop recording and toured overseas for a year and a half. When she returned to the US, she decided not to release her previous album domestically, and started working on a new album. Milian traveled the world, working with the popular producers Bloodshy &amp; Avant, &quot;Darkchild&quot;, Cory Rooney, Warryn Campbell, Bryan-Michael Cox and Polli Paul. Milian also appeared in the video game &quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot; (2003), where she plays non-playable character Angeline &quot;Angel&quot; Rodriguez.

Milian&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;, was released in the US on July 13, 2004. The critical response to the album was mixed; the club tracks, most notably lead single &quot;Dip It Low&quot;, were praised while the ballads were said to be disappointing. The style and sound of the album was compared to that of Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez by several critics. Milian later admitted that her new sexy image for &quot;Dip It Low&quot; and the whole album was mainly for shock value. She had to make her way back into the US market, and by choosing a sexier image, she made a name for herself. &quot;Dip It Low&quot; was also meant to show that she was not the same 18-year-old girl in the &quot;AM to PM&quot; video. To create her new image, Milian also decided to change her appearance and lightened her hair. Taking inspiration from Janet Jackson who constantly changed her image, Milian thought to herself, &quot;&#x27;When did I like Janet Jackson the most?&#x27; It was when she had her lightened hair.&quot;

Milian believed that the album was more R&amp;B when compared to her &quot;bubble-gum&quot; pop debut album. The change was reflected in the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Dip It Low&quot;, which was more of a club and R&amp;B track than her previous pop release &quot;AM to PM&quot;. Milian performed as an opening act on Usher&#x27;s &quot;Truth&quot; tour to promote her album. The album debuted and peaked at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and number 21 in the UK, selling a total of 382,000 and 63,708 copies respectively, and received a Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album&quot; in 2005. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Dip It Low&quot;, became Milian&#x27;s biggest hit to date, reaching number two in the UK and number five in the US. The single was certified Gold by the RIAA for digital sales, and earned a Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Best Rap/Sung Collaboration&quot;. The album&#x27;s second and final single, &quot;Whatever U Want&quot;, featuring Joe Budden, failed to reprise the success of the lead single. &quot;Whatever U Want&quot; was more successful in the United Kingdom, where the song peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart in October 2004.

===2005–2006: &quot;So Amazin″&quot; and label departure===
Milian starred in &quot;Be Cool&quot; (2005), the sequel to &quot;Get Shorty&quot;, with John Travolta and Uma Thurman, and recorded two songs for its soundtrack. She was then cast in a lead role in the horror film &quot;Pulse&quot;, starring alongside Kristen Bell and Ian Somerhalder. The film was a remake of the Japanese film &quot;Kairo&quot; (2001), and was adapted by Wes Craven and Ray Wright. Filming took place in Romania, a traumatic time for Milian, where she endured racial abuse and discovered that boyfriend Nick Cannon was cheating on her. The same year, Milian was awarded with a humanitarian award at The Reign fundraiser from the Elton John AIDS Foundation for being a role model for young children. Milian said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never been rewarded that way and never been acknowledged like that. That was really nice of them, and I was happy I was able to show up for the kids.&quot;

Whereas Milian&#x27;s previous albums had pop and R&amp;B stylings, she was encouraged by Island Def Jam to target a new audience and release an urban record. L.A. Reid suggested to Milian that she should work with Cool &amp; Dre, with whom she ended up working with as the first people to start off the album. Although Milian was originally supposed to work with several different music producers, she felt that the chemistry they had in the first week was so &quot;instant and real&quot; that she felt she could not get a better &quot;vibe&quot; with anybody else other than them. Milian ended up working with Cool &amp; Dre on the majority of the production of the album, producing ten of the album&#x27;s eleven tracks together. The album was completed within a three-month period.

Milian&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;So Amazin&#x27;&quot;, was released on May 16, 2006. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Say I&quot;, featured rapper Young Jeezy. The single saw peak positions of number four in the UK, and number twenty-one in the US. &quot;So Amazin″&quot; debuted and peaked at number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, selling 54,000 copies in its first week and 163,000 copies in total. Internationally, the album peaked at number 55 on the Swiss Albums Chart, 67 on the UK Albums Chart, and 139 on the France Albums Chart. Reviews of &quot;So Amazin″&quot; were mixed; critics felt that while Milian claimed that she was displaying the various sides of her personality, the album could &quot;only [scratch] the surface of who she really is.&quot; &quot;Say I&quot; was praised by several critics, and was described as &quot;instantly rousing&quot; and &quot;intoxicating&quot;. In June 2006, Milian&#x27;s representative confirmed that Island had released her from the imprint. In an interview with &quot;Rap-Up&quot;, Milian revealed she was dropped a week after her album was released. The singer believed it was a &quot;budget cut&quot;, and that Island Def Jam wanted to spend more money on label mate Rihanna; Milian also turned down what would later be Rihanna&#x27;s hit single, &quot;SOS&quot;. She said, &quot;it was embarrassing. It was a week after my album got put out. I would be in my room a lot of the time crying by myself.&quot; After leaving Def Jam, Milian released her first compilation album, &quot;The Best of Christina Milian&quot; (2006).

=== 2007–2010: Canceled album and continued acting ===

In 2007, Milian worked with the Children Uniting Nations charity, in which she was a big sister to foster children. In May, it was reported that she was to be a leading character in The CW&#x27;s show &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; as Olivia, alongside Mario Lopez, but The CW decided not to pick up the series due to the Writers Guild of America strike. In December, Milian starred as the main character in the Christmas television movie for the ABC Family channel entitled &quot;Snowglobe&quot;, alongside Lorraine Bracco. That year, Milian began working on material for her fourth studio album, first announced to be titled &quot;Dream in Color&quot; in 2008 but retitled as &quot;Elope&quot; the following year. She collaborated with numerous producers, including Cool &amp; Dre, J. R. Rotem, The Runners, Danja, Terry &quot;MaddScientist&quot; Thomas, T-Pain, Jim Jonsin and Toby Gad.

Milian signed with MySpace Records in 2008. The single &quot;Us Against the World&quot; premiered via MySpace on October 6, 2008, and was made available by digital download the next day. Milian appeared in the video game &quot;Need for Speed: Undercover&quot; (2008) as one of the female leads, Carmen Mendez.

In early 2009, Milian began working with The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, and L.O.S. Da Maestro, which led to her signing a deal with Radio Killa Records. Milian revealed that aside from &quot;Us Against the World&quot;, The-Dream and Tricky Stewart would be producing all the songs on her album. In June 2009, The-Dream said that the album was finished. Upon completion of the album, Milian said it represented &quot;independence, not having to answer to any type of &#x27;authority&#x27;, being a woman at her best and feeling very confident&quot;. In August 2009, Milian confirmed that she had signed a deal to release &quot;Elope&quot; through Interscope Records with a 2010 release date. Milian became romantically involved with The-Dream, and the pair eloped that September. Milian announced that she was pregnant, and in October, it was reported that the album had been postponed. The pair separated in late 2009, only three months after their wedding. Despite the separation, Milian and The-Dream continued to &quot;work together and write together&quot;. That year, Milian had a minor role in &quot;Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&quot; alongside Matthew McConaughey, and starred as the lead role in the straight-to-DVD film &quot;Bring It On: Fight to the Finish&quot;.

In January 2010, Milian said that she was going back into the studio in the summer to record more material. Although the album had already been finished, she wanted to &quot;go back and re-do some of the music and make some new songs and find my new inspiration&quot;. At the 2010 Los Angeles Fashion Week, Milian performed &quot;Dip It Low&quot; and the new song &quot;Zipper&quot;. At the 2010 American Music Awards, she said the album would be ready in 2011. In September 2011, however, she confirmed that the material recorded for &quot;Elope&quot; would not be released, and the album was ultimately shelved.

===2010–present: Return to music, &quot;The Voice&quot; and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;===
In June 2011, her collaboration with The Jackie Boyz titled &quot;Memory&quot; was released in Japan. It appeared on their album &quot;Songs In My Blackberry&quot;. NBC announced on October 27 that Milian would serve as the official Social Media Correspondent for &quot;The Voice&quot; during its second season. The role saw Milian make regular appearances during the live broadcasts. Milian maintained the role through its fourth season.

On February 12, 2012, Christina Milian parted ways with Radio Killa Records and signed with Young Money. The next day, a song titled &quot;Mr. Valentine&quot; leaked onto the internet. In May 2013, she collaborated with the Stafford Brothers and Lil&#x27; Wayne on the single &quot;Hello&quot; which reached the Top 15 on the Billboard Dance charts. In September 2013, Milian became a contestant on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (season 17). She was partnered with professional dancer Mark Ballas. She was eliminated in the fifth week, finishing in the ninth place. In November 2014, she collaborated with Lil&#x27; Wayne on his single, &quot;Start a Fire&quot;, which they performed on the American Music Awards.
On January 18, 2015, Milian&#x27;s reality show, &quot;Christina Milian Turned Up,&quot; premiered on E!. The series follows the day-to-day lives of Christina, her mother Carmen and her two sisters, Danielle and Liz Flores. It was renewed for a second season in April, which premiered in November 2015. In March, she released the singles &quot;Rebel&quot; and &quot;We Ain&#x27;t Worried&quot;; the latter was used to promote her &quot;We Are Pop Culture&quot; clothing line. In July, she announced she was going to release a 5-track EP and video set, and was working with director Mike Ho. That month, she performed the National Anthem at the 2015 Americafest and premiered a new single &quot;Like Me&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg. A few months later, she released another single &quot;Do It&quot; with Lil&#x27; Wayne. Her EP &quot;4U&quot; was released on December 4, 2015. The EP was released independently through her own label, Milianheiress Music, though she remained signed to Young Money.

In 2016, she collaborated with So Solid Crew&#x27;s MC Harvey on the dance track &quot;We Own the Night&quot; which premiered on August 12, 2016. In June 2017, she appeared as a judge/panelist on the Fox television show, &quot;Superhuman&quot;.

In 2019, Milian starred in the Netflix romantic comedy &quot;Falling Inn Love&quot; (2019), costarring Adam Demos. &quot;Falling Inn Love&quot; was the first Netflix movie to be shot entirely in New Zealand. In 2023 she joined the Netflix romantic comedy, &quot;Meet Me Next Christmas&quot;, as executive producer and cast member. The film was released in November 2024 on the streaming plattform. In 2024, Milian was cast as María LaGuerta in &quot;Dexter&quot;-prequel television show &quot;&quot;.

== Entrepreneurship ==
Milian co-owns Viva Diva Wines with her mother and manager Carmen Milian, as well as her publicist Robyn Santiago.

==Personal life==

=== Heritage ===
Milian has been faced with the challenges of being an Afro-Latina, stating:
I&#x27;m Cuban but [people] didn&#x27;t get it because I was also brown-skinned... Latinos come in all colors, all shades... You should see my mom and her brothers and sisters... We just vary in color, shapes and sizes. But we&#x27;re still Latinos — that doesn&#x27;t change a damn thing.

=== Relationships and children ===
Milian met actor Nick Cannon on the set of their film, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing&quot;, in 2003, and they began dating. After being together for two and a half years, Milian ended her relationship with Cannon in 2005 because of his infidelity.

After the production of &quot;So Amazin″&quot; in 2006, Milian began dating Andre Lyon from the production group Cool &amp; Dre. The pair dated until February 2009.

In February 2009, reports emerged that Milian was dating musician The-Dream. In late May 2009, it was reported that Milian and The-Dream were getting married, and the couple celebrated their engagement party in Las Vegas in June. On September 4, 2009, Milian and The-Dream eloped and were married at the Little White Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. MTV reported that Milian and The-Dream would get married again in Rome, Italy, and then renew their vows in the US in front of family and friends. On September 11, 2009, it was announced that Milian and The-Dream were expecting their first child together. The pair separated in late 2009, after only three months. On February 26, 2010, Milian gave birth to a daughter. This was Milian&#x27;s first child, and the fourth for The-Dream, who had three children with ex-wife Nivea. As a Catholic, she baptized her daughter into the faith. Two years after she and The-Dream separated, their divorce became finalized on October 23, 2011.

In September 2010, Milian began dating James &quot;Jas&quot; Prince, Jr., son of impresario James Prince, the founder and CEO of Rap-A-Lot Records. In April 2013, Milian and Prince became engaged. However, she moved out of the couple&#x27;s home on June 19, 2014, and the couple called off their engagement.

In July 2014, it was rumored she was dating rapper Lil Wayne, with whom she attended the ESPY Awards. They later confirmed their relationship in mid-2015. They split in August 2015 after collaborating on various singles, videos, and concert dates.

Milian has been in a relationship with French singer M. Pokora since 2017. In July 2019, the couple announced they were expecting a baby boy together, who was born in January 2020. In December 2020, the couple announced they were expecting their second child together, and they were also married that month. In April 2021, they welcomed their second son. Since 2023, Milian lives in France.

==Artistry==
Milian possesses a soprano vocal range. Her vocal style has been compared to Paula Abdul and Aaliyah by critics. David Peisner of &quot;Maxim&quot; commented on her talent and described her voice as being &quot;silky and sassy.&quot; Earlier in her career, Milian was mainly an urban pop and teen pop singer but as she matured and grew her sound later grew to branch out into a more hip hop soul and straight forward R&amp;B sound on her later two releases &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; (2004) and &quot;So Amazin″&quot; (2006).

Milian described the sound of the album as &quot;hip hop under-toned with nice, pop melodies&quot;, and later said the genre of the album was &quot;bubble-gum pop&quot;. She described lead single &quot;AM to PM&quot; as a &quot;very pop&quot; and &quot;fun, party/club song&quot;. The genre of the album was described by one critic as &quot;light-hearted, energetic R&amp;B pop tunes&quot;. Sonically, the album was said to stick &quot;rigidly to the sherbert-snorting pop formula of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera&quot;. One reviewer compared Milian to other singers of her generation, and found that &quot;while Spears has gone raunchy with &#x27;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&#x27;, Christina Aguilera down and dirty on &quot;Stripped&quot;, and even clean-cut Mandy Moore has brashly cut her hair Felicity-style, Milian still seems young and real.&quot; The critic also compared Milian to Beyoncé, &quot;while Beyonce is shaking her bootylicious body like crazy on &#x27;Crazy In Love&#x27;, Milian is simply enjoying becoming a young star.&quot;
Milian described the genre of &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; as more R&amp;B in comparison to her &quot;bubble-gum pop&quot; debut album. Discussing the change of genre between her lead singles, Milian said that the &quot;first single off my last album, &#x27;AM to PM&#x27;, was more of a kiddie kind of thing, very pop. [Dip It Low] is more R&amp;B, kind of a club/party kind of vibe.&quot; An issue Milian had with the album was that it did not flow. The various pop and urban influences in that album, she found, confused the audience. For her next studio album, Milian said that she wanted a more consistent feel.

==Other ventures==
In 2010, Milian signed Australian singers, Kasey Osborne and Kelsey-Maree, as their manager. Milian said, &quot;the girls have everything it takes to be the biggest international duo out there. The world is definitely ready for these beautiful girls to hit the stage and kill it on screen.&quot; She said that the duo were the &quot;most exciting project&quot; she had worked on.

<text>Agkistrodon is a genus of pit vipers commonly known as American moccasins. The genus is endemic to North America, ranging from the Southern United States to northern Costa Rica. Eight species are currently recognized, all of them monotypic and closely related. Common names include: cottonmouths, copperheads, and cantils.

==Name origin==
The name &quot;Agkistrodon&quot; comes from the Greek words (, &#x27;fishhook&#x27;, with the irregular transliteration &quot;gk&quot; rather than the usual &quot;nk&quot;) and () &#x27;tooth&#x27; and is likely a reference to the fangs.

Some varieties of the genus are given the common name &quot;moccasin&quot; or &quot;moccasin snake&quot; in the United States, which is the Algonquian word for &quot;shoe&quot;. The origin of this nickname is unknown. The first known use of &quot;moccasin&quot; to refer to a deadly venomous snake was in a 1765 publication. The nickname is used to refer to both cottonmouths and copperheads. According to the Word Detective, this use may be related to their color and appearance or the silence with which they move. Another source for this name may be the Native American word &quot;mokesoji&quot; of unknown origin and meaning.

==Description==

Members of this genus have a number of features in common. All species have a relatively broad head with short fangs. A loreal scale is present, except in &quot;A. piscivorus&quot;. Usually, nine large symmetrical platelike scales are on the crown of the head, but in all species, these are often irregularly fragmented or have sutures, especially in &quot;A. bilineatus&quot;. All have a sharply defined canthus rostralis and a vertically elliptical pupil. Usually eight (6-10) supralabial scales and usually 10-11 (8-13) sublabials are present. The dorsal scales are mostly keeled and at midbody number 21-25 (usually 23), while &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; has 23-27 (usually 25). The snake has 127-157 ventral scales and 36-71 subcaudals. Of the latter, some may be divided. The anal scale is single. All have a color pattern of 10-20 dark crossbands on a lighter ground color, although sometimes the crossbands are staggered as half bands on either side of the body.

The phylogeny of the species has long been controversial. Studies based on morphological and venom characteristics support the idea that &quot;A. bilineatus&quot; and &quot;A. contortrix&quot; are more closely related. However, an analysis of mitochondrial DNA, as well as more recent molecular studies, have concluded that &quot;A. bilineatus&quot; and &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; are sister taxa, with &quot;A. contortrix&quot; being a sister species to them both.

==Geographic range==

They are found in North America from the northeastern and central United States southward through peninsular Florida and southwestern Texas, and in Central America on the Atlantic versant from Tamaulipas and Nuevo León southward to the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, and Guatemala. They are seen along the Pacific coastal plain and lower foothills from Sonora south through Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to northwestern Costa Rica.

==Behavior==
All are semiaquatic to terrestrial and are often found near sources of water. However, &quot;A. contortrix&quot; and &quot;A. bilineatus&quot; are also found in dry habitats, often far from permanent streams or ponds.

==Reproduction==
The members of this genus are all ovoviviparous.

A 2012 study found that they are not only capable of parthenogenesis (asexual reproduction), but that litters created without a male may account for up to 5% of litters in the wild, even in areas that have males present. This phenomenon had previously only been observed in captive populations. 

==Venom==
Pit vipers of the genus &quot;Agkistrodon&quot; rely on a potent venom they produce for their survival. Used to immobilize prey and fend off predators, one bite can inject enough venom into a human to cause severe pain, swelling, weakness, difficulty breathing, hemorrhaging, gangrene, fever, vomiting, and in rare instances, even death.

The venom of all three species is assumed to be not unlike that of &quot;A. contortrix&quot;, which contains thrombin-like enzymes that act upon the coagulant activity of the blood. A study of electrophoretic patterns of proteins in venoms among and within populations of &quot;A. contortrix&quot; and &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; showed that substantial variation exists, and no reason exists to believe that these differences do not correspond with variations in toxicity.

===Research===
In a study conducted at the College of Medicine at the University of Florida, venom from &quot;A. piscivorous&quot; was injected into the lymph fluid of a frog. The frog immediately suffocated because of the collapse of its lung sacs. The venom even resulted in lung constriction when directly applied to the surface of the frog&#x27;s lungs. To test this, trace amounts of venom were dropped onto a single pulmonary sac in a frog&#x27;s lung after it was anesthetized and its chest cavity dissected open. A drop of solution containing a venom concentration of 1 mg/ml was enough to cause contraction of the pulmonary artery adventitia after 5-8 sec in a frog weighing 40 g. The study found, however, that this toxic effect is simply a tool the snake can choose to employ from an accessory venom gland it has. In most instances, the viper injects a venom that tends to immobilize, not kill, its prey before ingestion. In this case, the main venom glands secrete a toxin that inhibits the prey&#x27;s sympathetic response to flee or fend off its predator. This essentially stuns the animal so that the predator can easily attack.

==Species==

T Type species.

==Taxonomy==
This genus was previously much larger and also included the following genera:

* &quot;Calloselasma&quot; - Ground pit viper found in Southeast Asia (Malaya).
* &quot;Deinagkistrodon&quot; - The Hundred-pace viper found mostly in southern China.
* &quot;Gloydius&quot; - Ground pit vipers found in Asia.
* &quot;Hypnale&quot; - Hump-nosed vipers found in India and Sri Lanka.

<text>Manas-vijnana (Skt. &quot;&#x27;मानस-विज्ञान&quot;&#x27;; mānas-vijñāna; &quot;mind-knowledge&quot;, compare &quot;man-tra&quot;, jñāna) is the seventh of the eight consciousnesses as taught in Yogacara and Zen Buddhism, the higher consciousness or intuitive consciousness that on the one hand localizes experience through thinking and on the other hand universalizes experience through intuitive perception of the universal mind of alayavijnana. Manas-vijnana, also known as klista-manas-vijnana or simply manas, is not to be confused with &quot;manovijnana&quot; which is the sixth consciousness.

== Overlapping Pali terms for &quot;mind&quot; ==
According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the post-canonical Pali commentary uses the three terms &quot;viññāa&quot;, &quot;mano&quot; and &quot;citta&quot; as synonyms for the mind sense base (&quot;mana-ayatana&quot;); however, in the Sutta Pitaka, these three terms are generally contextualized differently:
* Viññāa refers to awareness through a specific internal sense base, that is, through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind. Thus, there are six sense-specific types of &quot;Viññāa&quot;. It is also the basis for personal continuity within and across lives.
* Manas refers to mental &quot;actions&quot; (&quot;kamma&quot;), as opposed to those actions that are physical or verbal. It is also the sixth internal sense base (&quot;ayatana&quot;), that is, the &quot;mind base,&quot; cognizing mental sensa (&quot;dhammā&quot;) as well as sensory information from the physical sense bases.
* Citta includes the formation of thought, emotion and volition; this is thus the subject of Buddhist mental development (&quot;bhava&quot;), the mechanism for release.

== Overlapping Sanskrit terms for &quot;mind&quot; ==
According to Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki (who uses the term &quot;Manas&quot; rather than &quot;Manas Vijnana&quot; for the seventh consciousness) the Lankavatara Sutra presents the Zen view of the Eight Consciousnesses rather than the Yogacara view. In his introduction to his translation of the Lankavatara Sutra he clarifies the distinction between the overlapping terms:

:What may be termed Buddhist psychology in the Laṅkā consists in the analysis of mind, that is, in the classification of the Vijñānas. To understand thus the psychology of Buddhism properly the knowledge of these terms is necessary: citta, manas, vijñāna, manovijñāna, and ālayavijñāna.
:To begin with Vijñāna. Vijñāna is composed of the prefix vi, meaning &quot;to divide&quot;, and the root jñā which means &quot;to perceive&quot;, &quot;to know&quot;. Thus, Vijñāna is the faculty of distinguishing or discerning or judging. When an object is presented before the eye, it is perceived and judged as a red apple or a piece of white linen; the faculty of doing this is called eye-vijñāna. In the same way, there are ear-vijñāna for sound, nose-vijñāna for odour, tongue-vijñāna for taste, body-vijñāna for touch, and thought-vijñāna (manovijñāna) for ideas—altogether six forms of Vijñāna for distinguishing the various aspects of world external or internal.
:Of these six Vijñānas, the Manovijñāna is the most important as it is directly related to an inner faculty known as Manas. Manas roughly corresponds to mind as an organ of thought, but in fact it is more than that, for it is also a strong power of attaching itself to the result of thinking. The former may even be considered subordinate to this power of attachment. The Manas first wills, then it discriminates to judge; to judge is to divide, and this dividing ends in viewing existence dualistically. Hence the Manas&#x27; tenacious attachment to the dualistic interpretation of existence. Willing and thinking are inextricably woven into the texture of Manas.
:Citta comes from the root cit, &quot;to think&quot;, but in the Laṅkā the derivation is made from the root ci, &quot;to pile up&quot;, &quot;to arrange in order&quot;. The Citta is thus a storehouse where the seeds of all thoughts and deeds are accumulated and stored up. The Citta, however, has a double sense, general and specific. When it is used in the general sense it means &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;mentation&quot;, &quot;ideas&quot;, including the activities of Manas and Manovijñāna, and also of the Vijñānas; while specifically it is a synonym of Ālayavijñāna in its relative aspects, and distinguishable from all the rest of the mental faculties. When, however, it is used in the form of Citta-mātra, Mind-only, it acquires still another connotation. We can say that Citta appears here in its highest possible sense, for it is then neither simply mentation nor intellection, nor perception as a function of consciousness. It is identifiable with the Ālaya in its absolute aspect. This will become clearer later on.
:Ālayavijñāna is ālaya+vijñāna, and ālaya is a store where things are hoarded for future use. The Citta as a cumulative faculty is thus identified with the Ālayavijñāna. Strictly speaking, the Ālaya is not a Vijñāna, has no discerning power in it; it indiscriminately harbours all that is poured into it through the channel of the Vijñānas. The Ālaya is perfectly neutral, indifferent, and does not offer to give judgments.

== Various descriptions of &quot;Manas-vijnana&quot; ==
* One of the primary functions of Manas-vijnana is to perceive the subjective position of the store consciousness and erroneously regard it as one&#x27;s own ego, thereby creating ego attachment.
* The basic nature of Manas-vijnana is that of thought.
* There is a difference between the &quot;thought&quot; of this seventh consciousness, Manas-vijnana, and the sixth consciousness &quot;thought&quot; of cognition.
* Not consciously controllable, Manas-vijnana is said to be a mind of a realm that gives rise to contradiction of conscious decisions, and to incessant self-love.
* Manas-vijnana can be described as &quot;the consciousness which sees the limits of human variation from within&quot;.
* Manas-vijnana consciousness is also described as the place where good and evil are eternally accumulated.
* Manas-vijnana consciousness is theorized as the connecting realm between the &quot;mano&quot;-consciousness and the &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;.
* Manas-vijnana as the seventh consciousness is the basis of human existence, which unceasingly continues and changes, and serves as the ground for the sixth consciousness of cognition.
* In part II of Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki&#x27;s Introduction, to his translation of the Lankavatara Sutra, the Manovijñāna, or &quot;that which knows thought&quot;, is directly related to an inner faculty known as &quot;Manas&quot;. &quot;Manas&quot; is a strong power that attaches to the &quot;result&quot; of thinking. From this viewpoint one could discern that the &quot;thought-consciousness&quot;, that part of the mind that is conscious of thought, also has the power to &quot;velcro&quot; itself to a completed thought process. This would explain the human difficulty of observing one&#x27;s own thoughts, as the &quot;manas&quot; or &quot;velcro&quot; must first be detached, so to speak.

<text>Cut Spelling is a system of English-language spelling reform which reduces redundant letters and makes substitutions to improve correspondence with the spoken word. It was designed by Christopher Upward and was for a time being popularized by the Simplified Spelling Society. The resulting words are 8–15% shorter than standard spellings. The name &quot;Cut Spelling&quot; was coined by psychologist Valerie Yule.

Unlike some other proposed reforms, Cut Spelling does not attempt to make English spelling phonemic, but merely attempts to remove many of the unneeded difficulties of the current spelling. Cut Spelling differs from &quot;traditional orthography&quot; mainly in removing letters from words and makes relatively few substitutions of letters compared with other proposed reforms. According to its designers, this allows readers accustomed to traditional orthography to get used to Cut Spelling fairly quickly and easily, while still giving learners of the language a much-simplified and more systematic spelling system.

== Rules ==
Cut Spelling uses three main reduction rules to convert traditional spellings into &quot;cut spellings&quot;:

# Letters irrelevant to pronunciation. This rule deletes most silent letters, except when these letters (such as &quot;magic e&quot;) help indicate pronunciation. Omitting or including the wrong silent letters are common errors. Examples: &quot;peace&quot; → &quot;pece&quot;, &quot;except&quot; → &quot;exept&quot;, &quot;plaque&quot; → &quot;plaq&quot;, &quot;blood&quot; → &quot;blod&quot;, &quot;pitch&quot; → &quot;pich&quot;.
# Cutting unstressed vowels. English unstressed syllables are usually pronounced with the vowel schwa , which has no standard spelling, but can be represented by any vowel letter. Writing the wrong letter in these syllables is a common error ─ for example, writing &quot;&quot; for &quot;separate&quot;. Cut Spelling eliminates these vowel letters completely before approximants ( and ) and nasals (, , and ). In addition, some vowel letters are dropped in suffixes, reducing the confusion between &quot;-able&quot; and &quot;-ible&quot;. Examples: &quot;symbol&quot; → &quot;symbl&quot;, &quot;victim&quot; → &quot;victm&quot;, &quot;lemon&quot; → &quot;lemn&quot;, &quot;glamour/glamor&quot; → &quot;glamr&quot;, &quot;permanent&quot; → &quot;permnnt&quot;, &quot;waited&quot; → &quot;waitd&quot;, &quot;churches&quot; → &quot;churchs&quot;, &quot;warmest&quot; → &quot;warmst&quot;, &quot;edible&quot; → &quot;edbl&quot;.
# Simplifying doubled consonants. This rule helps with another of the most common spelling errors: failing to double letters (&quot;accommodate&quot; and &quot;committee&quot; are often misspelled) or introducing erroneously doubled letters. Cut Spelling does not eliminate all doubled letters: in some words (especially two-syllable words) the doubled consonant letter is needed to differentiate from another differently pronounced word (e.g., &quot;holly&quot; and &quot;holy&quot;). Examples: &quot;innate&quot; → &quot;inate&quot;, &quot;necessary&quot; → &quot;&quot;, &quot;spell&quot; → &quot;spel&quot;.
The Cut Spelling system also uses three substitution rules:
# The digraphs &quot;gh&quot; and &quot;ph&quot; become &quot;f&quot; when pronounced . Examples: &quot;draught&quot; → &quot;draft&quot;, &quot;sulphur&quot; → &quot;sulfr&quot;, &quot;photograph&quot; → &quot;fotograf&quot;.
# The letter &quot;g&quot; is changed to &quot;j&quot; when pronounced or . Examples: &quot;judge&quot; → &quot;juj&quot;, &quot;rouge&quot; → &quot;ruje&quot;.
# The combinations &quot;ig&quot; and &quot;igh&quot; are changed to &quot;y&quot; when pronounced . Examples: &quot;flight&quot; → &quot;flyt&quot;, &quot;sign&quot; → &quot;syn&quot;.

&quot;The Cut Spelling Handbook&quot; also lists optional additional rules such as replacing &quot;ch&quot; with &quot;k&quot; when it makes the sound, respelling as &quot;y&quot; unusual patterns that make the diphthong, as well as replacing &quot;-tion&quot;, &quot;-cian&quot;, &quot;-sion&quot;, &quot;-ssion&quot;, etc. with &quot;-shn&quot;.

<text>Vipers are snakes in the family Viperidae, found in most parts of the world, except for Antarctica, Australia, Hawaii, Madagascar, New Zealand, Ireland, and various other isolated islands. They are venomous and have long (relative to non-vipers), hinged fangs that permit deep penetration and injection of their venom. Three subfamilies are currently recognized. They are also known as viperids. The name &quot;viper&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;vipera&quot;, -&quot;ae&quot;, also meaning viper, possibly from &quot;vivus&quot; (&quot;living&quot;) and &quot;parere&quot; (&quot;to beget&quot;), referring to the trait viviparity (giving live birth) common in vipers like most of the species of Boidae.

==Description==
All viperids have a pair of relatively long solenoglyphous (hollow) fangs that are used to inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws, just behind the eyes. Each of the two fangs is at the front of the mouth on a short maxillary bone that can rotate back and forth. When not in use, the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth and are enclosed in a membranous sheath. This rotating mechanism allows for very long fangs to be contained in a relatively small mouth. The left and right fangs can be rotated together or independently. During a strike, the mouth can open nearly 180° and the maxilla rotates forward, erecting the fangs as late as possible so that the fangs do not become damaged, as they are brittle. The jaws close upon impact and the muscular sheaths encapsulating the venom glands contract, injecting the venom as the fangs penetrate the target. This action is very fast; in defensive strikes, it will be more a stab than a bite. Viperids use this mechanism primarily for immobilization and digestion of prey. Pre-digestion occurs as the venom contains proteases, which degrade tissues. Secondarily, it is used for self defense, though in cases with nonprey, such as humans, they may give a dry bite (not inject any venom). A dry bite allows the snake to conserve its precious reserve of venom, because once it has been depleted, time is needed to replenish it, leaving the snake vulnerable. In addition to being able to deliver dry bites, vipers can inject larger quantities of venom into larger prey targets, and smaller amounts into small prey. This causes the ideal amount of predigestion for the lowest amount of venom.

Almost all vipers have keeled scales, a stocky build with a short tail, and a triangle-shaped head distinct from the neck, owing to the location of the venom glands. The great majority have vertically elliptical, or slit-shaped, pupils that can open wide to cover most of the eye or close almost completely, which helps them to see in a wide range of light levels. Typically, vipers are nocturnal and ambush their prey.

Compared to many other snakes, vipers often appear rather sluggish. Most are ovoviviparous: the eggs are retained inside the mother&#x27;s body, and the young emerge living. However, a few lay eggs in nests. Typically, the number of young in a clutch remains constant, but as the weight of the mother increases, larger eggs are produced, yielding larger young.

==Geographic range==

Viperid snakes are found in the Americas, Africa, Eurasia, and South Asia. In the Americas, they are native from south of 48°N. In the Old World, viperids are located everywhere except Siberia, Ireland, and north of the Arctic Circle in Norway and Sweden. Wild viperids are not found in Australia. The common adder, a viperid, is the only venomous snake found in Great Britain.

==Venom==
Viperid venoms typically contain an abundance of protein-degrading enzymes, called proteases, that produce symptoms such as pain, strong local swelling and necrosis, blood loss from cardiovascular damage complicated by coagulopathy, and disruption of the blood-clotting system. Also being vasculotoxic in nature, viperine venom causes vascular endothelial damage and hemolysis. Death is usually caused by collapse in blood pressure. This is in contrast to elapid venoms, which generally contain neurotoxins that disable muscle contraction and cause paralysis. Death from elapid bites usually results from asphyxiation because the diaphragm can no longer contract, but this rule does not always apply; some elapid bites include proteolytic symptoms typical of viperid bites, while some viperid bites produce neurotoxic symptoms.

Proteolytic venom is also dual-purpose: first, it is used for defense and to immobilize prey, as with neurotoxic venoms; second, many of the venom&#x27;s enzymes have a digestive function, breaking down molecules such as lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. This is an important adaptation, as many vipers have inefficient digestive systems.

Due to the nature of proteolytic venom, a viperid bite is often a very painful experience and should always be taken seriously, though it may not necessarily prove fatal. Even with prompt and proper treatment, a bite can still result in a permanent scar, and in the worst cases, the affected limb may even have to be amputated. A victim&#x27;s fate is impossible to predict, as this depends on many factors, including the species and size of the snake involved, how much venom was injected (if any), and the size and condition of the patient before being bitten. Viper bite victims may also be allergic to the venom or the antivenom.

===Behavior===
These snakes can decide how much venom to inject depending on the circumstances. The most important determinant of venom expenditure is generally the size of the snake; larger specimens can deliver much more venom. The species is also important, since some are likely to inject more venom than others, may have more venom available, strike more accurately, or deliver a number of bites in a short time. In predatory bites, factors that influence the amount of venom injected include the size of the prey, the species of prey, and whether the prey item is held or released. The need to label prey for chemosensory relocation after a bite and release may also play a role. In defensive bites, the amount of venom injected may be determined by the size or species of the predator (or antagonist), as well as the assessed level of threat, although larger assailants and higher threat levels may not necessarily lead to larger amounts of venom being injected.

===Prey tracking===

Hemotoxic venom takes more time than neurotoxic venom to immobilize prey, so viperid snakes need to track down prey animals after they have been bitten, in a process known as &quot;prey relocalization&quot;. Vipers are able to do this via certain proteins contained in their venom. This important adaptation allowed rattlesnakes to evolve the strike-and-release bite mechanism, which provided a huge benefit to snakes by minimizing contact with potentially dangerous prey animals. This adaptation, then, requires the snake to track down the bitten animal to eat it, in an environment full of other animals of the same species. Western diamondback rattlesnakes respond more actively to mouse carcasses that have been injected with crude rattlesnake venom. When the various components of the venom were separated out, the snakes responded to mice injected with two kinds of disintegrins, which are responsible for allowing the snakes to track down their prey.

==Subfamilies==

Type genus = &quot;Vipera&quot; 

== Sensory organs ==

=== Heat-sensing pits ===
Pit vipers have specialized sensory organs near the nostrils called heat-sensing pits. The location of this organ is unique to pit vipers. These pits have the ability to detect thermal radiation emitted by warm-blooded animals, helping them better understand their environment. Internally the organ forms a small pit lined with membranes, external and internal, attached to the trigeminal nerve. Infrared light signals the internal membranes, which in turn signal the trigeminal nerve and send the infrared signals to the brain, where they are overlaid onto the visual image created by the eyes.

==Taxonomy==
Whether family Viperidae is attributed to Oppel (1811), as opposed to Laurenti (1768) or Gray (1825), is subject to some interpretation. The consensus among leading experts, though, is that Laurenti used &quot;viperae&quot; as the plural of &quot;vipera&quot; (Latin for &quot;viper&quot;, &quot;adder&quot;, or &quot;snake&quot;) and did not intend for it to indicate a family group taxon. Rather, it is attributed to Oppel, based on his Viperini as a distinct family group name, despite the fact that Gray was the first to use the form Viperinae.

<text> (; &quot;The Electoral Gazette&quot; in English) is a Polish nationwide daily newspaper based in Warsaw, Poland. It was launched on 8 May 1989 on the basis of the Polish Round Table Agreement and as a press organ of the trade union &quot;Solidarity&quot; in the election campaign before the Contract Sejm. Initially created to cover Poland&#x27;s first partially free parliamentary elections, it rapidly grew into a major publication, reaching a circulation of over 500,000 copies at its peak in the 1990s.

It is published by Agora, with its original editor-in-chief Adam Michnik, appointed by Lech Wałęsa, is one of Poland&#x27;s newspapers of record, covering the gamut of political, international and general news from a left-liberal perspective. &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot; also publishes thematic supplements addressing topics such as economy, law, education, and health, including &quot;Duży Format&quot;, &quot;Co Jest Grane 24&quot;, and &quot;Wysokie Obcasy&quot;.

Since its founding, &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;&#x27;s investigative journalism has played a key role in shaping the Polish public opinion, such as its coverage of the Rywin affair, the Skin Hunters scandal in 2002, and the PKN Orlen scandal in 2004. In recent years, &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot; has emerged as a leading liberal voice on issues like the separation of church and state and civil liberties, including women&#x27;s rights and LGBT rights, which has sometimes resulted in conflicts with Poland&#x27;s conservative PiS-led government (which was in power between 2015 and 2023). , had over 290,000 digital subscribers, and 80,000 print sales. In 2020, was the 10th most read newspaper in Europe.

==History and profile==

=== Founding ===
 was established in accordance with the arrangements of the Round Table, as a press organ of the Solidarity Civic Committee in the election campaign before the parliamentary elections in 1989. Initially, the daily was to be called &quot;Gazeta Codzienna&quot;, and the adjective &quot;election&quot; was to function only during the election campaign. The first eight-page issue was published on 8 May 1989, in a circulation of 150,000 copies.

 was first published on 8 May 1989, under the rhyming masthead motto, &quot;Nie ma wolności bez Solidarności&quot; (&quot;There&#x27;s no freedom without Solidarity&quot;). The founders were Andrzej Wajda, Aleksander Paszyński and Zbigniew Bujak. Its founding was an outcome of the Polish Round Table Agreement between the communist government of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland and political opponents centred on the Solidarity movement. It was initially owned by Agora SA. Later the American company Cox Communications partially bought the daily.

The paper was to serve as the voice of the Solidarity movement during the run-up to the 1989 parliamentary elections (hence its title). As such, it was the first legal newspaper published outside the government&#x27;s control since its founding of regime in the late 1940s.

It was prepared by 20 journalists, most previously associated with the underground weekly &quot;Tygodnik Mazowsze&quot;. Michnik convinced Wałęsa to name him the editor-in-chief. Helena Łuczywo and Ernest Skalski became Michnik&#x27;s deputies. The first editorial office was located in a former kindergarten in Mokotów.

According to the editors, the first edition was small (150,000 copies) and relatively expensive due to the limited supplies of paper made available by the government. A year and a half later, the daily run had reached 500,000 copies. In September 1990, during the breakup of the Solidarity camp following the collapse of the communist government, Wałęsa revoked the paper&#x27;s right to use the Solidarity logo on its masthead. Since then, the has been an independent newspaper broadly aligned with the centre-left and liberal position.

After the Round Table talks during the presidential crisis, on 3 July 1989, an article by Michnik, with the headline: &quot;Your president, our prime minister,&quot; where he opted for the election of the president on the recommendation of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party and at the same time entrusting the mission of forming a government to a representative of the &quot;Solidarity,&quot; postulating &quot;an alliance of the democratic opposition with the reformist wing of the ruling camp.&quot; This proposal is currently interpreted as a proof of sensing the aspirations of the Solidarity camp to take over more power than was agreed at the Round Table, but officially met with opposition. Nevertheless, it was actually implemented: while Wojciech Jaruzelski, the current First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, took over the position of president, the opposition, thanks to the votes of former allies of the communist party, formed the first non-communist government in Eastern Europe with Tadeusz Mazowiecki as prime minister.

From the second half of 1989, the environment concentrated in the editorial office &quot;of Wyborcza&quot; sympathized with the government of Tadeusz Mazowiecki , and at the same time was in conflict with the representatives &quot;of Tygodnik Solidarność&quot;. These antagonisms correlated with the political conflict known as the &quot;War on the Mountain&quot;, during which Wałęsa allied himself with the Civic Committee faction represented by the brothers Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński against Mazowiecki. Adam Michnik supported the Prime Minister&#x27;s environment, as a result of which, in September 1990, the National Commission of &quot;Solidarity&quot; adopted a resolution aimed at taking away &quot;Wyborcza&quot; the right to place the &quot;Solidarity&quot; stamp on the vignette. It was argued that &quot;the bias of articles aimed at discrediting and ridiculing the chairman of Lech Wałęsa&quot; and explaining that &quot;&quot;Gazeta&quot; is not an information organ of &quot;S&quot;, but a private company.&quot;

At that time, &quot;Tygodnik Solidarność&quot;, whose editor-in-chief at the time was Jarosław Kaczyński, published columns by columnists such as Romuald Szeremietiew, who accused the newspaper of manipulating information, including concealing events . As a result, the daily lost the right to use the union&#x27;s logo and the slogan &quot;There is no freedom without Solidarity&quot;. In addition, Wałęsa demanded the dismissal of Michnik (since July 1990 belonging to the Movement of Citizens, Democratic Action party ) from the post of editor-in-chief. Michnik resigned, but his resignation was not accepted by the members of the editorial office, and therefore he remained in office. A group of former oppositionists associated with Lech Wałęsa left the editorial office, which was the result of a dispute within the editorial office with a group of post-Solidarity circles representing different views.

== Controversies ==
In the following years, &quot;Wyborcza&#x27;s&quot; publications contributed to the disclosure of socio-political events in Poland. The daily began a journalistic investigation into the 1997 &quot;gelatin scandal,&quot; a monopoly scam which included an entrepreneur Kazimierz Grabek.

===Rywin affair===
On 27 December 2002, &quot;Wyborcza&quot; published an article &quot;An act for a bribe. Rywin comes to Michnik,&quot; related to an attempt to bribe the editor-in-chief of the newspaper by the film producer Lew Rywin. The aim of Rywin&#x27;s actions, who presented himself as a representative of the &quot;group holding power&quot;, was to persuade Michnik to support the law prepared by the ruling Alliance of the Democratic Left, preventing the expansion of media companies to electronic media. Smoleński&#x27;s article initiated the Rywin affair, which resulted in the appointment of a parliamentary investigative commission. Together with other corruption scandals plaguing the country, the Rywin affair plunged the government of Leszek Miller, but Michnik himself—also screened by the commission in terms of business connections with Agora—met with a wave of criticism from other media.

In 2003, a Polish film producer Lew Rywin was accused by of attempted bribery after he had allegedly solicited a bribe of $17.5 million from the editor Adam Michnik in exchange for amendments to a draft media legislation. The adoption of the draft law in the government&#x27;s original form would have prevented Agora S.A. from purchasing Polsat, one of Poland&#x27;s private TV stations. The case, dubbed the Rywin affair, led to an official inquiry by the Polish Parliament. Consequently, Lew Rywin was sentenced for attempting to influence the parliamentary legislative process aimed at enabling a Polish media company to buy a television station. The controversial draft legislation ended up being rejected by the Polish parliament.

=== Other major reports ===
A newspaper article from 23 January 2002 revealed an affair regarding the killing of patients by the employees of the Lodz ambulance service and the sale of information about deaths to funeral parlors.

An April 2004 report revealed irregularities related to the detention by the State Protection Office of the president of PKN Orlen, Andrzej Modrzejewski, and depriving him of his position in February 2002, initiating the Orlen scandal. The parliamentary investigative committee showed unclear interests in the then attempted privatization of Orlen, and Zbigniew Siemiątkowski, the head of the UOP responsible for arresting Modrzejewski, was convicted by a final judgment for abuse of power.

As a result of the article from 4 December 2006 entitled &quot;Work for sex in Self-Defense,&quot; another political and moral scandal called the sex scandal broke out. Kącki revealed that Andrzej Lepper, president of the Samoobrona RP party and incumbent deputy prime minister, allegedly employed young women in party offices in exchange for sex.

==Criticism==
 used its influence to whitewash former communists, particularly General Jaruzelski. After the fall of real socialism, the paper was criticized for taking part in an &quot;intensive propaganda campaign&quot; and particularly for rigorously trying to revamp Jaruzelski&#x27;s image.

==Circulation==

The paper is a multi-section daily newspaper and it publishes daily local editions for the following cities: Warsaw, Białystok, Bydgoszcz, Częstochowa, Gdańsk, Gorzów Wielkopolski, Katowice, Kraków, Kielce, Lublin, Łódź, Olsztyn, Opole, Płock, Poznań, Radom, Rzeszów, Szczecin, Toruń, Wrocław, and Zielona Góra.

The had a circulation of 432,000 copies during the first three quarters of 1998. The circulation of the paper reached 459,473 copies between January and February 2001. Its circulation was 542,000 copies in 2003, making it the second best selling newspaper in the country. The 2004 circulation of the paper was 516,000 copies on weekdays and 686,000 copies on weekends. The average circulation of the newspaper peaked at 672,000, making the the largest-selling newspaper in Poland. However, by 2010 the circulation had declined by more than half, to 319,000, and &quot;Fakt&quot; overtook the as Poland&#x27;s leading newspaper. The decline continued in 2013 when circulation was down to 190,000. At this time, Wyborcza began to invest more in its electronic version, and launched a subscription service. Paper circulation dropped to 86,000 in 2019, and stabilised at 81,000 in early 2020. As of January 2021, average daily circulation is 62,000. In August 2021, average daily circulation dropped to 53,190.

=== Changing the operating mode ===
In September 2020, the office space occupied by the editorial office at ul. Czerska in Warsaw has decreased by 40%, because the journalists of the newspaper and its website work outside the office: the employees of the paper edition can work homework, and most of the journalists and editors of the website work remotely.

==Sections==

 is divided into several sections. On the other side of the diary there is a collection of columns written by people associated with the magazine&#x27;s editorial office, entitled &quot;On the other side&quot;. The following sections are arranged according to the topics covered:

* The &quot;Country&quot; and &quot;World&quot; sections apply to news coming from Poland and abroad, respectively.

=== Print style ===
 is published in a five-column block format, which was adopted at the beginning of the daily&#x27;s existence. The magazine is printed in color on white paper, and its cover exposes the most important subject of the day in the form of a large headline. The current style of the daily is based on the change made on 7 March 2006, when its graphic design was updated, taken over from Agora&#x27;s closed daily &quot;Nowy Dzien&quot;. The primary typeface used in the articles is of the Tribune type, designed by the Boston-based company Font Bureau.

==Online presence==
For the first time, content from supplements to was made available by Agora on the Internet in 1994. The first archived pages of the magazine&#x27;s information website come from December 1996 (located in the gazeta.pl domain), and from May 2001 (located in the Wyborcza.pl domain). As early as 2001, the website functioning in the gazeta.pl domain, initially being the Internet version &quot;of Wyborcza&quot; , was transformed into a separate informational Internet portal .
In 2006, a separate website, gazetawyborcza.pl, was separated from the Gazeta.pl portal, being an electronic version of . Currently, the website operates in the Wyborcza.pl domain, functioning as the name of the website. The first editor-in-chief of the website was Edward Krzemień. The Wyborcza.pl website publishes articles that were simultaneously published in the printed version of the daily and its supplements. In addition, the website publishes additional content not present in the printed : video materials, thematically grouped photos, drawings. In 2012, an online archive of was launched.

In addition to the Wyborcza.pl portal, the content of the magazine is also published on a separate website Wyborcza.biz, devoted to economics and the economy. The Wyborcza.pl website is linked to the BIQdata portal, where socio-political reports are published in the form of charts, infographics and other graphic representations of numerical values. Its opening took place on 23 September 2014.

&quot;Wysokie Obcasy.pl&quot; features content concerning women and includes section on psychology, health and beauty, food, and jobs. &quot;Biqdata.wyborcza.pl&quot; is dedicated to stories and developments as seen through the prism of big data and the wider world of information technology.

In 2014, introduced a digital subscription. The basic package includes access to the news on the website and through the app. The premium package offers access to all of its content including 28 local editions. The club package offers access to its editorial team, special events, and two additional subscriptions for family members. The entire content of on the Internet has been payable since February 4, 2014. The number of digital subscriptions in subsequent years was: 55,000 (2014), 77,000 (2015), 100,000 (2016), 200,000 (2019), 220,000 (2020), and 260,000 (2021).

=== Mobile app ===
Content from is available both in the version for personal computers and via the mobile application. On 10 June 2009, iPhone owners were able to download the journal app from the App Store. On 20 July 2012, the iPad application was launched. In February 2012, viewing journal articles was made possible on the Kindle. The first version of the application for devices with the Android operating system, produced by the We Like Caps development studio, appeared on Google Play on 7 July 2014.

<text>Kedem Winery is a kosher food and beverage manufacturing and distribution company, incorporated in the United States since 1958, established as Royal Wine Corporation in June 1948 and run by the Herzog family since 1958. 

Kedem currently sells over a million cases of kosher wine and grape juice annually, in sixteen countries worldwide. Formerly headquartered in New York City, it is now based in Bayonne, New Jersey. Vineyards for wine and grape juice are based in Marlboro, New York. It is especially known for its grape juice and NY state wines, as well as Kedem Tea Biscuits.

Kedem Foods is a sister brand that also produces other food products, and has merged with Kenover Marketing and B&amp;W Foods to form the largest kosher food conglomerate, Kayco Kosher, which in turn owns other kosher food brands, such as Manischewitz, Hadar, and Gefen.

==History==
The Herzog family first operated a winery in Czechoslovakia. The winery was the exclusive wine supplier to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, who granted Philip Herzog (1843-1918) the title of baron. Though the wines for the emperor were not necessarily kosher wines, all of the other wines were produced under the full scrutiny of kosher law.

During World War II, the Herzog winery was seized by the Nazis. The Herzogs, who stayed in hiding, immigrated to the United States after the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état. Living in New York City, Eugene Herzog—Philip&#x27;s grandson—began working for the Royal Wine Corporation and part of his salary was paid in company shares. By 1958, he was a majority stockholder and purchased the company and started doing business under the name Kedem. The current CEO of Royal Wine Corporation is Mordechai Herzog.

Kedem wines are part of the Royal Wine Corporation, the largest importer of Israeli wines and spirits in the US., which is in turn owned by KayCo, the largest Kosher food distributor.

<doc id="657958" wikidata="Q1418321" url="?curid=657958" title="Cooperative game theory">
<text>In game theory, a cooperative game (or coalitional game) is a game with groups of players who form binding “coalitions” with external enforcement of cooperative behavior (e.g. through contract law). This is different from non-cooperative games in which there is either no possibility to forge alliances or all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).

Cooperative games are analysed by focusing on coalitions that can be formed, and the joint actions that groups can take and the resulting collective payoffs.

== Mathematical definition ==

A cooperative game is given by specifying a value for every coalition. Formally, the coalitional game consists of a finite set of players formula_1, called the &quot;grand coalition&quot;, and a &quot;characteristic function&quot; formula_2 from the set of all possible coalitions of players to a set of payments that satisfies formula_3. The function describes how much collective payoff a set of players can gain by forming a coalition.

== Cooperative game theory definition ==
Cooperative game theory is a branch of game theory that deals with the study of games where players can form coalitions, cooperate with one another, and make binding agreements. The theory offers mathematical methods for analysing scenarios in which two or more players are required to make choices that will affect other players wellbeing. 

Common interests: In cooperative games, players share a common interest in achieving a specific goal or outcome. The players must identify and agree on a common interest to establish the foundation and reasoning for cooperation. Once the players have a clear understanding of their shared interest, they can work together to achieve it.

Necessary information exchange: Cooperation requires communication and information exchange among the players. Players must share information about their preferences, resources, and constraints to identify opportunities for mutual gain. By sharing information, players can better understand each other&#x27;s goals and work towards achieving them together.

Voluntariness, equality, and mutual benefit: In cooperative games, players voluntarily come together to form coalitions and make agreements. The players must be equal partners in the coalition, and any agreements must be mutually beneficial. Cooperation is only sustainable if all parties feel they are receiving a fair share of the benefits.

Compulsory contract: In cooperative games, agreements between players are binding and mandatory. Once the players have agreed to a particular course of action, they have an obligation to follow through. The players must trust each other to keep their commitments, and there must be mechanisms in place to enforce the agreements. By making agreements binding and mandatory, players can ensure that they will achieve their shared goal.

== Subgames ==

Let formula_4 be a non-empty coalition of players. The &quot;subgame&quot; formula_5 on formula_6 is naturally defined as

: formula_7

In other words, we simply restrict our attention to coalitions contained in formula_6. Subgames are useful because they allow us to apply solution concepts defined for the grand coalition on smaller coalitions.

== Properties for characterization ==
=== Superadditivity ===
Characteristic functions are often assumed to be superadditive . This means that the value of a union of disjoint coalitions is no less than the sum of the coalitions&#x27; separate values:

formula_9 whenever formula_10 satisfy formula_11.

=== Monotonicity ===
Larger coalitions gain more:

formula_12.

This follows from superadditivity. i.e. if payoffs are normalized so singleton coalitions have zero value.

=== Properties for simple games ===
A coalitional game is considered simple if payoffs are either 1 or 0, i.e. coalitions are either &quot;winning&quot; or &quot;losing&quot;.

Equivalently, a simple game can be defined as a collection of coalitions, where the members of are called winning coalitions, and the others losing coalitions.
It is sometimes assumed that a simple game is nonempty or that it does not contain an empty set. However, in other areas of mathematics, simple games are also called hypergraphs or Boolean functions (logic functions).

* A simple game is monotonic if any coalition containing a winning coalition is also winning, that is, if formula_13 and formula_14 imply formula_15.
* A simple game is proper if the complement (opposition) of any winning coalition is losing, that is, if formula_13 implies formula_17.
* A simple game is strong if the complement of any losing coalition is winning, that is, if formula_18 implies formula_19.
** If a simple game is proper and strong, then a coalition is winning if and only if its complement is losing, that is, formula_13 iff formula_17. (If is a coalitional simple game that is proper and strong, formula_22 for any .)
* A veto player (vetoer) in a simple game is a player that belongs to all winning coalitions. Supposing there is a veto player, any coalition not containing a veto player is losing. A simple game is weak (&quot;collegial&quot;) if it has a veto player, that is, if the intersection formula_23 of all winning coalitions is nonempty.
** A dictator in a simple game is a veto player such that any coalition containing this player is winning. The dictator does not belong to any losing coalition. (Dictator games in experimental economics are unrelated to this.)
* A carrier of a simple game is a set formula_24 such that for any coalition , we have formula_13 iff formula_26. When a simple game has a carrier, any player not belonging to it is ignored. A simple game is sometimes called &quot;finite&quot; if it has a finite carrier (even if is infinite).
* The Nakamura number of a simple game is the minimal number of &quot;winning coalitions&quot; with empty intersection. According to Nakamura&#x27;s theorem, the number measures the degree of rationality; it is an indicator of the extent to which an aggregation rule can yield well-defined choices.

A few relations among the above axioms have widely been recognized, such as the following
(e.g., Peleg, 2002, Section 2.1):

* If a simple game is weak, it is proper.
* A simple game is dictatorial if and only if it is strong and weak.

More generally, a complete investigation of the relation among the four conventional axioms
(monotonicity, properness, strongness, and non-weakness), finiteness, and algorithmic computability
has been made (Kumabe and Mihara, 2011),
whose results are summarized in the Table &quot;Existence of Simple Games&quot; below.

The restrictions that various axioms for simple games impose on their Nakamura number were also studied extensively.
In particular, a computable simple game without a veto player has a Nakamura number greater than 3 only if it is a &quot;proper&quot; and &quot;non-strong&quot; game.

== Relation with non-cooperative theory ==

Let &quot;G&quot; be a strategic (non-cooperative) game. Then, assuming that coalitions have the ability to enforce coordinated behaviour, there are several cooperative games associated with &quot;G&quot;. These games are often referred to as &quot;representations of G&quot;. The two standard representations are:

* The α-effective game associates with each coalition the sum of gains its members can &#x27;guarantee&#x27; by joining forces. By &#x27;guaranteeing&#x27;, it is meant that the value is the max-min, e.g. the maximal value of the minimum taken over the opposition&#x27;s strategies.
* The β-effective game associates with each coalition the sum of gains its members can &#x27;strategically guarantee&#x27; by joining forces. By &#x27;strategically guaranteeing&#x27;, it is meant that the value is the min-max, e.g. the minimal value of the maximum taken over the opposition&#x27;s strategies.

== Solution concepts ==

The main assumption in cooperative game theory is that the grand coalition formula_1 will form. The challenge is then to allocate the payoff formula_28 among the players in some way. (This assumption is not restrictive, because even if players split off and form smaller coalitions, we can apply solution concepts to the subgames defined by whatever coalitions actually form.) A &quot;solution concept&quot; is a vector formula_29 (or a set of vectors) that represents the allocation to each player. Researchers have proposed different solution concepts based on different notions of fairness. Some properties to look for in a solution concept include:

* Efficiency: The payoff vector exactly splits the total value: formula_30.
* Individual rationality: No player receives less than what he could get on his own: formula_31.
* Existence: The solution concept exists for any game formula_32.
* Uniqueness: The solution concept is unique for any game formula_32.
* Marginality: The payoff of a player depends only on the marginal contribution of this player, i.e., if these marginal contributions are the same in two different games, then the payoff is the same: formula_34 implies that formula_35 is the same in formula_36 and in formula_37.
* Monotonicity: The payoff of a player increases if the marginal contribution of this player increase: formula_38 implies that formula_35 is weakly greater in formula_37 than in formula_36.
* Computational ease: The solution concept can be calculated efficiently (i.e. in polynomial time with respect to the number of players formula_42.)
* Symmetry: The solution concept formula_43 allocates equal payments formula_44 to symmetric players formula_45, formula_46. Two players formula_45, formula_46 are &quot;symmetric&quot; if formula_49; that is, we can exchange one player for the other in any coalition that contains only one of the players and not change the payoff.
* Additivity: The allocation to a player in a sum of two games is the sum of the allocations to the player in each individual game. Mathematically, if formula_32 and formula_51 are games, the game formula_52 simply assigns to any coalition the sum of the payoffs the coalition would get in the two individual games. An additive solution concept assigns to every player in formula_52 the sum of what he would receive in formula_32 and formula_51.
* Zero Allocation to Null Players: The allocation to a null player is zero. A &quot;null player&quot; formula_45 satisfies formula_57. In economic terms, a null player&#x27;s marginal value to any coalition that does not contain him is zero.

An efficient payoff vector is called a &quot;pre-imputation&quot;, and an individually rational pre-imputation is called an imputation. Most solution concepts are imputations.

The stable set of a game (also known as the &quot;von Neumann-Morgenstern solution&quot; ) was the first solution proposed for games with more than 2 players. Let formula_32 be a game and let formula_43, formula_60 be two imputations of formula_32. Then formula_43 &quot;dominates&quot; formula_60 if some coalition formula_64 satisfies formula_65 and formula_66. In other words, players in formula_6 prefer the payoffs from formula_43 to those from formula_60, and they can threaten to leave the grand coalition if formula_60 is used because the payoff they obtain on their own is at least as large as the allocation they receive under formula_43.

A &quot;stable set&quot; is a set of imputations that satisfies two properties:

* Internal stability: No payoff vector in the stable set is dominated by another vector in the set.
* External stability: All payoff vectors outside the set are dominated by at least one vector in the set.

Von Neumann and Morgenstern saw the stable set as the collection of acceptable behaviours in a society: None is clearly preferred to any other, but for each unacceptable behaviour there is a preferred alternative. The definition is very general allowing the concept to be used in a wide variety of game formats.

==== Properties ====

* A stable set may or may not exist , and if it exists it is typically not unique . Stable sets are usually difficult to find. This and other difficulties have led to the development of many other solution concepts.
* A positive fraction of cooperative games have unique stable sets consisting of the core .
* A positive fraction of cooperative games have stable sets which discriminate formula_72 players. In such sets at least formula_73 of the discriminated players are excluded .

=== The core ===
Let formula_32 be a game. The &quot;core&quot; of formula_32 is the set of payoff vectors

: formula_76

In words, the core is the set of imputations under which no coalition has a value greater than the sum of its members&#x27; payoffs. Therefore, no coalition has incentive to leave the grand coalition and receive a larger payoff.

==== Properties ====

* The core of a game may be empty (see the Bondareva–Shapley theorem). Games with non-empty cores are called &quot;balanced&quot;.
* If it is non-empty, the core does not necessarily contain a unique vector.
* The core is contained in any stable set, and if the core is stable it is the unique stable set; see for a proof.

=== The core of a simple game with respect to preferences ===

For simple games, there is another notion of the core, when each player is assumed to have preferences on a set formula_77 of alternatives.
A &quot;profile&quot; is a list formula_78 of individual preferences formula_79 on formula_77.
Here formula_81 means that individual formula_82 prefers alternative formula_83
to formula_84 at profile formula_85.
Given a simple game formula_36 and a profile formula_85, a &quot;dominance&quot; relation formula_88 is defined
on formula_77 by formula_90 if and only if there is a winning coalition formula_91
(i.e., formula_92) satisfying formula_81 for all formula_94.
The &quot;core&quot; formula_95 of the simple game formula_36 with respect to the profile formula_85 of preferences
is the set of alternatives undominated by formula_88
(the set of maximal elements of formula_77 with respect to formula_88):

: formula_101 if and only if there is no formula_102 such that formula_103.

The &quot;Nakamura number&quot; of a simple game is the minimal number of winning coalitions with empty intersection.
&quot;Nakamura&#x27;s theorem&quot; states that the core formula_95 is nonempty for all profiles formula_85 of &quot;acyclic&quot; (alternatively, &quot;transitive&quot;) preferences
if and only if formula_77 is finite &quot;and&quot; the cardinal number (the number of elements) of formula_77 is less than the Nakamura number of formula_36.
A variant by Kumabe and Mihara states that the core formula_95 is nonempty for all profiles formula_85 of preferences that have a &quot;maximal element&quot;
if and only if the cardinal number of formula_77 is less than the Nakamura number of formula_36. (See Nakamura number for details.)

=== The strong epsilon-core ===

Because the core may be empty, a generalization was introduced in . The &quot;strong formula_113-core&quot; for some number formula_114 is the set of payoff vectors

: formula_115

In economic terms, the strong formula_113-core is the set of pre-imputations where no coalition can improve its payoff by leaving the grand coalition, if it must pay a penalty of formula_113 for leaving. formula_113 may be negative, in which case it represents a bonus for leaving the grand coalition. Clearly, regardless of whether the core is empty, the strong formula_113-core will be non-empty for a large enough value of formula_113 and empty for a small enough (possibly negative) value of formula_113. Following this line of reasoning, the &quot;least-core&quot;, introduced in , is the intersection of all non-empty strong formula_113-cores. It can also be viewed as the strong formula_113-core for the smallest value of formula_113 that makes the set non-empty .

=== The Shapley value ===
The &quot;Shapley value&quot; is the unique payoff vector that is efficient, symmetric, and satisfies monotonicity. It was introduced by Lloyd Shapley who showed that it is the unique payoff vector that is efficient, symmetric, additive, and assigns zero payoffs to dummy players. The Shapley value of a superadditive game is individually rational, but this is not true in general. 

=== The kernel ===

Let formula_2 be a game, and let formula_29 be an efficient payoff vector. The &quot;maximum surplus&quot; of player &quot;i&quot; over player &quot;j&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot; is

: formula_127

the maximal amount player &quot;i&quot; can gain without the cooperation of player &quot;j&quot; by withdrawing from the grand coalition &quot;N&quot; under payoff vector &quot;x&quot;, assuming that the other players in &quot;i&quot;&#x27;s withdrawing coalition are satisfied with their payoffs under &quot;x&quot;. The maximum surplus is a way to measure one player&#x27;s bargaining power over another. The &quot;kernel&quot; of formula_36 is the set of imputations &quot;x&quot; that satisfy

* formula_129, and
* formula_130

for every pair of players &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. Intuitively, player &quot;i&quot; has more bargaining power than player &quot;j&quot; with respect to imputation &quot;x&quot; if formula_131, but player &quot;j&quot; is immune to player &quot;i&quot;&#x27;s threats if formula_132, because he can obtain this payoff on his own. The kernel contains all imputations where no player has this bargaining power over another. This solution concept was first introduced in .

===Harsanyi dividend ===

The &quot;Harsanyi dividend&quot; (named after John Harsanyi, who used it to generalize the Shapley value in 1963) identifies the surplus that is created by a coalition of players in a cooperative game. To specify this surplus, the worth of this coalition is corrected by subtracting the surplus that was already created by subcoalitions. To this end, the dividend formula_133 of coalition formula_91 in game formula_36 is recursively determined by

formula_136

An explicit formula for the dividend is given by formula_137. The function formula_138 is also known as the Möbius inverse of formula_139. Indeed, we can recover formula_36 from formula_141 by help of the formula formula_142.

Harsanyi dividends are useful for analyzing both games and solution concepts, e.g. the Shapley value is obtained by distributing the dividend of each coalition among its members, i.e., the Shapley value formula_143 of player formula_82 in game formula_36 is given by summing up a player&#x27;s share of the dividends of all coalitions that she belongs to, formula_146.

=== The nucleolus ===

Let formula_2 be a game, and let formula_29 be a payoff vector. The &quot;excess&quot; of formula_43 for a coalition formula_150 is the quantity formula_151; that is, the gain that players in coalition formula_6 can obtain if they withdraw from the grand coalition formula_1 under payoff formula_43 and instead take the payoff formula_155. The &quot;nucleolus&quot; of formula_32 is the imputation for which the vector of excesses of all coalitions (a vector in formula_157) is smallest in the leximin order. The nucleolus was introduced in .

 gave a more intuitive description: Starting with the least-core, record the coalitions for which the right-hand side of the inequality in the definition of formula_158 cannot be further reduced without making the set empty. Continue decreasing the right-hand side for the remaining coalitions, until it cannot be reduced without making the set empty. Record the new set of coalitions for which the inequalities hold at equality; continue decreasing the right-hand side of remaining coalitions and repeat this process as many times as necessary until all coalitions have been recorded. The resulting payoff vector is the nucleolus.

==== Properties ====

* Although the definition does not explicitly state it, the nucleolus is always unique. (See Section II.7 of for a proof.)
* If the core is non-empty, the nucleolus is in the core.
* The nucleolus is always in the kernel, and since the kernel is contained in the bargaining set, it is always in the bargaining set (see for details.)

Introduced by Shapley in , convex cooperative games capture the intuitive property some games have of &quot;snowballing&quot;. Specifically, a game is &quot;convex&quot; if its characteristic function formula_32 is supermodular:

: formula_160

It can be shown (see, e.g., Section V.1 of ) that the supermodularity of formula_32 is equivalent to

: formula_162

that is, &quot;the incentives for joining a coalition increase as the coalition grows&quot; , leading to the aforementioned snowball effect. For cost games, the inequalities are reversed, so that we say the cost game is &quot;convex&quot; if the characteristic function is submodular.

=== Properties ===

Convex cooperative games have many nice properties:

* Supermodularity trivially implies superadditivity.
* Convex games are &quot;totally balanced&quot;: The core of a convex game is non-empty, and since any subgame of a convex game is convex, the core of any subgame is also non-empty.
* A convex game has a unique stable set that coincides with its core.
* The Shapley value of a convex game is the center of gravity of its core.
* An extreme point (vertex) of the core can be found in polynomial time using the greedy algorithm: Let formula_163 be a permutation of the players, and let formula_164 be the set of players ordered formula_165 through formula_45 in formula_167, for any formula_168, with formula_169. Then the payoff formula_29 defined by formula_171 is a vertex of the core of formula_32. Any vertex of the core can be constructed in this way by choosing an appropriate permutation formula_167.

=== Similarities and differences with combinatorial optimization ===

Submodular and supermodular set functions are also studied in combinatorial optimization. Many of the results in have analogues in , where submodular functions were first presented as generalizations of matroids. In this context, the core of a convex cost game is called the &quot;base polyhedron&quot;, because its elements generalize base properties of matroids.

However, the optimization community generally considers submodular functions to be the discrete analogues of convex functions , because the minimization of both types of functions is computationally tractable. Unfortunately, this conflicts directly with Shapley&#x27;s original definition of supermodular functions as &quot;convex&quot;.

Corporate strategic decisions can develop and create value through cooperative game theory. This means that cooperative game theory can become the strategic theory of the firm, and different CGT solutions can simulate different institutions.

<text>Lanuvium, modern Lanuvio, is an ancient city of Latium vetus, some southeast of Rome, a little southwest of the Via Appia.

Situated on an isolated hill projecting south from the main mass of the Alban Hills, Lanuvium commanded an extensive view over the low country between it and the sea. 

==History==

According to legend, Lanuvium was founded by Diomedes, or by one Lanoios, an exile from Troy. The first documented traces of the settlement date from the 9th century BC and by the 6th century BC it was part of the Latin League.

The city warred against Rome at the battles of Aricia (504 BC) and Lake Regillus (496 BC), as well as in 383 and 341 BC, mostly with negative outcomes. Rome conquered Lanuvium in 338 BC; at first, its inhabitants did not enjoy the right of Roman citizenship, but acquired it later. In imperial times the city&#x27;s chief magistrate and municipal council kept the titles of &quot;dictator&quot; and &quot;senatus&quot; respectively.

In the 11th c. the city became known as Civita Lavinia, a result of the confusion between it and ancient Lavinium.

==Cult of Juno==

Lanuvium was especially noted for its rich and much venerated temple of Juno Sospes (Livy 8.14; Cic. &quot;Nat. D.&quot; 1.83; &quot;Fin.&quot; 2.63), from which Octavian borrowed money in 31 BC, and the possessions of which extended as far as the coast of the Mediterranean. It possessed many other temples repaired by Antoninus Pius, who was born close by (S. H. A. &quot;Ant. Pius&quot; 1), as was Commodus.

==Prominent citizens==
One prominent native of Lanuvium was Lucius Licinius Murena (consul of 62 BC), whom Cicero defended in late 63 BC. Others include the actor Roscius (Cic. &quot;Div.&quot; 36), the political agitator Titus Annius Milo, who was convicted for the murder of Clodius (Cic. &quot;Mil.&quot; 27) and Publius Sulpicius Quirinius, consul of 12 BC and later legate of Syria.

==Monuments==

Remains of the ancient theatre and of the city walls exist in the modern town, and above it is an area surrounded by a portico, in &quot;opus reticulatum&quot;, upon the north side of which is a rectangular building in &quot;opus quadratum&quot;, probably connected with the temple of Juno where archaic decorative terracottas artifacts have been found. The acropolis of the primitive city was probably on the highest point above the temple to the north. The neighborhood, which is now covered with vineyards, contains the remains of many Roman villas, one of which is traditionally attributed to the Emperor Antoninus Pius.

<doc id="657967" wikidata="Q241115" url="?curid=657967" title="Elke Sommer">
<text>Elke Sommer (; née Schletz, 5 November 1940) is a German actress. She appeared in numerous films throughout the 1960s and 1970s, including roles in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; sequel &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (1964), the Bob Hope comedy &quot;Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number!&quot; (1966), Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1974), and the British &quot;Carry On&quot; series in &quot;Carry On Behind&quot; (1975).

== Early life ==
Sommer was born in Berlin to Baron Peter von Schletz, a Lutheran minister, and his wife Renata, &quot;née&quot; Topp. During the Second World War (in 1942), the family was evacuated to Niederndorf, a village near Erlangen, a small university town in Franconia. From 1950, she attended a gymnasium (university-preparatory secondary school). Her father died when she was 14. Elke was good with languages, but math and science posed challenges, so her mother let her drop out of gymnasium in 1957 one year after graduating from middle school. In the spring of 1957, she moved to London for one year to work as an au pair for the family of now actress Vicki Michelle and to attend an English language institute three times a week. This was her first time away from home and family, and she was quite homesick.

== Career ==
=== Discovery ===
Sommer was spotted by film director Vittorio De Sica while on holiday in Italy, and she began appearing in films there in 1958. Also that year, she changed her surname from Schletz to Sommer. She soon became a sex symbol and moved to Hollywood in the early 1960s. Sommer became one of the more popular pin-up girls of the time, posing for pictorials in the September 1964 and December 1967 issues of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

=== The 1960s ===
Sommer became one of the top film actresses of the 1960s. She made 99 film and television appearances from 1959 to 2005, including &quot;The Prize&quot; (1963) with Paul Newman, &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (1964) with Peter Sellers, &quot;The Art of Love&quot; (1965) with James Garner and Dick Van Dyke, &quot;The Oscar&quot; (1966) with Stephen Boyd, &quot;Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number!&quot; (1966) with Bob Hope, the Bulldog Drummond extravaganza &quot;Deadlier Than the Male&quot; (1966), &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; (1968) with Dean Martin and Sharon Tate, and &quot;The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz&quot; (1968); in each of these films she was the leading lady.

In 1964, she won a Golden Globe award as Most Promising Newcomer Actress for &quot;The Prize&quot;, a film in which she co-starred with Paul Newman and Edward G. Robinson.

A frequent guest on television, Sommer sang and participated in comedy sketches on episodes of &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and on Bob Hope specials, made 10 appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and was a panelist on the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; game show many times between 1971 and 1980, when Peter Marshall was its host.

=== The 1970s ===
Sommer&#x27;s films during the 1970s included the thriller &quot;Zeppelin&quot;, in which she co-starred with Michael York, and a 1974 remake of Agatha Christie&#x27;s murder mystery &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;. In 1972, she starred in two Italian horror films directed by Mario Bava: &quot;Baron Blood&quot; and &quot;Lisa and the Devil&quot;. The latter was re-edited (with 1975 footage inserted) to make a different film titled &quot;House of Exorcism&quot;. Sommer went back to Italy to act in additional scenes for &quot;Lisa and the Devil&quot;, which its producer inserted into the film to convert it to &quot;House of Exorcism&quot; against the wishes of the director.

In 1975, Peter Rogers cast her in the British comedy &quot;Carry On Behind&quot; as the Russian Professor Vrooshka. She became the &quot;Carry On&quot; films&#x27; joint highest-paid performer, at £30,000; this was an honour that she shared with Phil Silvers (who starred in &quot;Follow That Camel&quot;).

Most of her movie work during the decade came in European films. After the 1979 comedy &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, which reunited her with Sellers, the actress did virtually no more acting in Hollywood films, concentrating more on her artwork.

Sommer also performed as a singer, recording and releasing several albums.

=== Later work ===
In the 1980s, Sommer hosted a syndicated programme titled &quot;The Exciting World of Speed and Beauty&quot;. She also appeared twice on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in episodes that aired in May of 1987 and in May of 1989.

After the 1990s, Sommer concentrated more on painting than on acting. As an actress, she had worked in six countries learning the languages (she speaks seven languages) and storing images which she has expressed on canvas. Her artwork shows a strong influence from Marc Chagall.

Sommer was embroiled in a long-running feud with Zsa Zsa Gabor that began in 1984 when both appeared on &quot;Circus of the Stars&quot;. The feud escalated into a multimillion-dollar libel suit by 1993, resulting in Sommer being awarded $3.3-million in damages from Gabor and her husband, Frederick von Anhalt, for defaming her in interviews published in a pair of German publications in 1990.

In 2001, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her.

Sommer provided the voice of Yzma in the German version of &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;.

== Personal life ==

In 1964, Sommer married Hollywood columnist Joe Hyams (1923–2008), who was 17 years her senior, in Las Vegas.

They later divorced, and she met Wolf Walther, eight years her junior and the managing director of a luxury hotel, Essex House, in New York City. They were married on 29 August 1993 in Franconia. In a 2014 interview, Sommer described how she and Walther met:

I was in New York City starring in &quot;Tamara&quot; and had to stay there for four months. So, I had to find an apartment but they were excruciatingly expensive, tiny and loud. As I knew the managing director of the Essex House, I wanted to talk to him about renting a room but the hotel had a new managing director, a man by the name of Wolf Walther. So we met. For him, it was love at first sight. For me, it took a little longer, but not much longer. As you may know, &quot;Tamara&quot; is a play in which the audience follows the actor of their choice, and as you may also know, my husband is 6&#x27;5&quot; and hard to miss. I saw him every night in the audience, following me. Every night. And that was the beginning of the greatest love story of my life, still unfolding and getting better by the day.

As of May 2017, Sommer was living in Los Angeles, California.

<text>Scott Edward Spiezio (; born September 21, 1972) is an American former professional baseball infielder. He is well known for his time as a member of the Anaheim Angels, when he hit a three-run home run in Game Six of the 2002 World Series against the San Francisco Giants, sparking the Angels to a dramatic come-from-behind victory. He also played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, and St. Louis Cardinals, and is the son of former major leaguer Ed Spiezio.

In addition to Spiezio&#x27;s pivotal moment helping the Angels win the World Series, was also his most productive full season, with a .807 OPS. Spiezio was a utility player on the St. Louis Cardinals 2006 World Series championship team.

==Amateur career==
Spiezio attended Morris High School in Morris, Illinois, and was a letterman in baseball. In baseball, he was named his league&#x27;s MVP and was an All-State selection.

Spiezio played college baseball for the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. He made the All-Big 10 Team in baseball in and . In 1992, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and returned to the league in 1993 to play for the Cotuit Kettleers.

==Professional career==
===Oakland A&#x27;s===
Spiezio was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the 1993 player draft and signed later that year. He made his debut with the 1996 A&#x27;s and established himself as a classic utility player, making starts at first base, second base, and third base, and as a switch hitter with more power when batting left-handed.

===Anaheim Angels===
Spiezio signed as a free agent with the Anaheim Angels ahead of the 2000 season. During his years with the Angels, he made appearances in left field and right field, as well as first, second, and third base. In 2002, he had a career year. Playing every day, he set career highs in batting average, on-base percentage and RBI. It was in the postseason that he had his greatest success. Spiezio batted 18 for 55 (.327) for Anaheim in the playoffs that year. In Game 6 of the 2002 World Series, with Anaheim trailing three games to two in the series, trailing 5–0 in the seventh inning of the game, and facing a Series loss, Spiezio hit a three-run homer off of Félix Rodríguez to pull his team to within two runs. A lead off homer by Darin Erstad followed by a two-run double by Troy Glaus in the next inning won the game for the Angels by a 6–5 score, and the Angels would go on to win their first ever World Series championship 4–3. Spiezio tied Sandy Alomar Jr.&#x27;s postseason record with 19 RBI in one postseason that was set in 1997.

===Seattle Mariners===
After the 2003 season, Spiezio became a free agent and signed a contract with the Seattle Mariners. The next two seasons were the worst of his career. He tripped over a mound during 2004 spring training, resulting in a debilitating back injury. At one point, there were concerns the injury could threaten his career and potentially leave him paralyzed. He hit .215 that season and played only 29 games the next year (compiling an .064 average) before the Mariners released him on August 19, 2005.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
On February 18, 2006, Spiezio signed a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals with an invitation to the club&#x27;s spring training. Spiezio played well enough during the Cardinals&#x27; exhibition to secure a roster spot with the team as a reserve infielder entering the 2006 season. This move would reunite Spiezio with his former Angels teammate, shortstop David Eckstein.

Spiezio, used as a pinch hitter and all-around reserve player as well as the primary backup to Scott Rolen at third base, had his best season since 2002 for the 2006 Cardinals, hitting 13 home runs and driving in 52 runs despite only getting 276 at-bats. He would have another dramatic moment in the playoffs. With the Cardinals trailing, 6–4, in the seventh inning of Game 2 of the 2006 National League Championship Series, Spiezio hit a two-run triple to tie the score. The Cardinals went on to win the game and the series in seven games, then proceeded to win the 2006 World Series, earning Spiezio his second World Series ring.

On November 16, 2006, Spiezio signed a two-year contract to return to the Cardinals until the end of the 2008 season, with a club option for 2009. The deal was worth an estimated $4.5 million.

On June 15, 2007, Spiezio took the mound as a relief pitcher in the bottom of the eighth inning of a lopsided loss against the Athletics. His fastball was clocked as high as 87 mph. He pitched one inning, giving up one walk, no hits, no runs, and no strikeouts. After having pitched in one game, Spiezio played six positions in his career (seven counting designated hitter), missing catcher, shortstop, and center field.

===Release===
On August 7, 2007, Spiezio received IV fluids. He was described as being &quot;irritable and anxious&quot;. Spiezio disconnected his IV and left the stadium rather than accept medical treatment. On August 9, 2007, the Cardinals placed him on the restricted list. The Cardinals stated that Spiezio would be seeking treatment for an unspecified substance abuse problem. On September 14, 2007, Spiezio was removed from the restricted list after 36 days and also reactivated to play in that evening&#x27;s home game.

On February 27, 2008, the Cardinals released Spiezio after police in Irvine, California issued a warrant for his arrest. The warrant was issued on six charges relating to a car crash on December 30, 2007. According to Irvine police, a drunken Spiezio crashed his BMW into a fence, then ran from the scene. In April, he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation and 80 hours community service. He was also ordered to undergo three months of alcohol treatment and attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

On March 31, 2008, Spiezio signed a minor league deal with the Atlanta Braves and was assigned to their top affiliate, the Richmond Braves. He showed signs of his old form, batting .333 in five games. However, he was released on April 12 for being unprepared to play in a game. Spiezio later said that while he was sober at the time, he was in a deep depression after being released by the Cardinals and wasn&#x27;t ready to take the field. Combined with a strained relationship with his first wife and the prospect of not being able to see his kids for two months, he decided to go home for the year.

===Independent leagues===
Spiezio believed he was finished with baseball after his major league career, but decided to give it another shot in 2009. The Angels put him in touch with the Orange County Flyers of the independent Golden Baseball League. Flyers manager Phil Nevin, a former major leaguer, decided to sign Spiezio after letting him work out for a week and getting assurances he was mentally ready to play. Spiezio signed another one-year deal to play the 2010 season for the Newark Bears. He hit .279 with three home runs and 35 RBI while appearing in 52 games.

==Personal life==
Spiezio is the son of two-time World Series champion Ed Spiezio.

On April 7, 2015, at 2:30 AM, police in Ottawa, Illinois, responded to a call that Spiezio punched out a window at the apartment where his then-girlfriend and infant son lived. Spiezio fled police and was later found through the use of a K-9 tracker behind a building, resulting in him being tased in order to be brought into custody. No charges were immediately filed.

In a 2022 interview with &quot;The Athletic,&quot; Spiezio revealed that he had spent the better part of 13 years battling substance abuse. He traced his downward spiral to the 2004 spring training injury, when the strain of being sidelined led him to begin drinking heavily, eventually drinking as much as a gallon of vodka per day. Over the years, he also became a cocaine addict. He admitted that during his time with the Cardinals, he frequently drank during games. As early as 2006, he had alienated so many of his friends in his hometown that no one joined him to celebrate the 2006 World Series win; in contrast, his friends threw him a huge party after the 2002 Series. By 2022, he had 12 stints in rehab and five arrests. His drug habit cost him both of his marriages and strained relationships with his family. His parents did not speak to him at all from 2005 to 2007 and had only sporadic contact with him from 2007 to 2011. He finally bottomed out in 2018, when he went to the hospital with severe jaundice from a badly damaged liver. He has been sober since then.

<text>Cheng Weishi Lun (, CWSL, Sanskrit reconstruction: &quot;*Vijñaptimātrāsiddhiśāstra&quot;, English: &quot;The Treatise on the Demonstration of Consciousness-only,&quot; Taisho Catalog number 1585), is a comprehensive treatise on the philosophy of Yogacara Buddhism and a commentary on Vasubandhu&#x27;s seminal work, the &quot;Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā&quot; (&quot;Thirty Verses on Consciousness-only&quot;). 

The CWSL was written by the early Tang dynasty monk Xuanzang (602–664), who drew on numerous Indian Yogacara sources and scholars as well as his experience of studying under Indian Yogacara masters like Nalanda&#x27;s Śīlabhadra and Prasenajit. 

==Overview==

When Xuanzang was studying Buddhism in India at Nālandā University with masters Śīlabhadra and Prasenajit, he is said to have studied ten commentaries on Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā,&quot; those of: Dharmapala, Sthiramati, Nanda, Citrabhanu, Bandhusri, Suddhacandra, Jinaputra, Gunamati, Jinamitra, and Jñanacandra. 

Back in China, Xuanzang drew upon his studies in India to write a detailed explanation of Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā&quot;. This synthetic commentary became the &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot;. Kuiji claimed that the interpretations of Dharmapāla were the only correct ones found in the CWSL and that Xuanzang follows the views of Dharmapāla. However, modern scholars have found that Kuiji often attributes to Dharmapāla certain interpretations which are actually found in the works of Sthiramati. Some modern scholars like Dan Lusthaus suggest that it is actually more likely that the CWSL reflects the views of Xuanzang&#x27;s teacher Prasenajit, as well as Xuanzang&#x27;s broad studies in other sources like the &quot;Yogacarabhumi&quot;. 

According to Francis Cook,The theory of the Ch’eng wei-shih lun is that basic or fundamental consciousness (mula-vijñana) comes to appear naturally and spontaneously in the form of a seeing part (darsana-bhaga) and a seen part (nimitta-bhaga). The seeming reality of an inner self perceiving external events is nothing more than one aspect of consciousness perceiving itself in the form of images. A third part of consciousness, the manas, or thinking aspect, interprets the two parts as a self and an external world. This situation is also the basis for hatred, craving, fear, and other passions. In fact, the apparently real external world of things is nothing but internal images perceived by consciousness and grasped as a source of attachment by thought.

=== Influence and commentaries ===
The &quot;Chéng Wéishì Lùn&quot; became one of the key texts of East Asian Yogācāra, both by Chinese (&quot;Faxiang&quot;) and Japanese (&quot;Hossō&quot;) thinkers. It is a major doctrinal source and summa for this tradition, also known as the Consciousness Only School (&quot;Wéishí-zōng&quot;). 

Kuiji, one of Xuanzang&#x27;s key pupils, wrote a commentary on the CWSL, called the &quot;Chéng Wéishì Lùn Shuji&quot; (成唯識 論述記; Taishō no. 1830, vol. 43, 229a–606c). Kuiji&#x27;s commentary relies on the epistemology of Dignāga and remains focused on an orthodox Yogacara interpretation. 

The Korean monk Woncheuk, another influential pupil of Xuanzang, wrote his own commentary, the &quot;Chéng Wéishì Lùn Ceshu&quot;, which disagrees with several of Kuiji&#x27;s positions. Woncheuk was a follower of the Shelun school (攝論宗) of Yogacara, which draws on the work of Paramārtha (499–569). This tradition defended Parāmartha&#x27;s teaching that there was a ninth consciousness called the &quot;pure consciousness&quot; (&quot;amalavijñāna&quot;). This position had been rejected by Xuanzang and Kuiji.

Another student of Xuanzang, the Japanese monk Dōshō (道昭, 629–700 CE) brought the CWSL to Japan in 660, creating the doctrinal foundation for the Japanese Consciousness-only (Jp: &quot;Hossō&quot;) school at Nara&#x27;s Gangōji Temple.

==English translations==
The Chinese scholar and philosopher Wei Tat translated the &quot;Chéng Wéishì Lùn&quot; into English for the first time in Hong Kong in 1973. He drew on various Chinese and Western sources for his research, especially the French translation of the CWSL by Louis de La Vallée Poussin. Poussin&#x27;s translation also included numerous annotations and passages from Kuiji&#x27;s commentary.

Francis Cook made a new English translation for the Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research&#x27;s Taishō Tripiṭaka translation effort.

In 2017, a new translation closely based on Louis de La Vallée Poussin&#x27;s French (along with many annotations) was published by Motilal Banarsidass as &quot;Vijñapti-mātratā-siddhi: A Commentary (Chéng Wéishì Lùn) on Vasubandhu&#x27;s Triṃśikā by Xuanzang.&quot; It is the work of Lodrö Sangpo, Migme Chödrön and A. L. Mayer. 

Peter Lunde Johnson has published a translation that is entitled &quot;&quot;On Realizing There is Only The Virtual Nature of Consciousness&quot; in 2019.

<text>La Cucaracha (, &quot;The Cockroach&quot;) is a popular folk song about a cockroach who cannot walk. The song&#x27;s origins are Spanish, but it became popular in the 1910s during the Mexican Revolution. The modern song has been adapted using the Mexican genre. The song&#x27;s melody is widely known and there are many alternative stanzas.

==Structure==

The song consists of verse-and-refrain (strophe-antistrophe) pairs, with each half of each pair consisting of four lines featuring an ABCB rhyme scheme.

===Refrain===

The song&#x27;s earliest lyrics, from which its name is derived, concern a cockroach that has lost two of its six legs and struggles to walk with the remaining four. 

:&quot;La &quot;cu&quot;-ca- | ra-&quot;cha&quot;, la &quot;cu&quot;-ca-ra-&quot;cha
:| ya &quot;no &quot;pue&quot;-de &quot;ca&quot;-mi-&quot;nar
:&quot;por-&quot;que&quot; no | tie-&quot;ne&quot;, por-&quot;que&quot; le fal-&quot;tan
:| las &quot;dos &quot;pa- &quot;titas&quot; &quot;de&quot; a-trás.— 

::(&quot;The cockroach, the cockroach / can no longer walk / because she doesn&#x27;t have, because she lacks / the two hind legs to walk&quot;; these lyrics form the basis for the refrain of most later versions. Syllables having primary stress are in boldface; syllables having secondary stress are in roman type; unstressed syllables are in italics. Measure divisions are independent of text line breaks and are indicated by vertical bar lines; note that the refrain begins with an anacrusis/&quot;pickup.&quot;)

Many later versions of the song, especially those whose lyrics do not mention the cockroach&#x27;s missing leg(s), extend the last syllable of each line to fit the more familiar 6/4 meter. Almost all modern versions, however, use a 4/4 meter instead with a clave rhythm to give the feeling of three pulses.

===Verses===

The song&#x27;s verses fit a traditional melody separate from that of the refrain but sharing the refrain&#x27;s meter (either 5/4, 6/4, or 4/4 clave as discussed above). In other respects, they are highly variable, usually providing satirical commentary on contemporary political or social problems or disputes.

==Historical evolution==

The origins of &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; are obscure. The lyrics of the refrain make no explicit reference to historical events, so it is difficult, if not impossible, to date them. However, because the verses are improvised according to the needs of the time, and mention contemporary social or political conditions, a rough estimate of their age can be made.

===Pre-Revolution lyrics===
Several early (pre-Revolution) sets of lyrics exist, referring to historical events.

In his book &quot;Cantos Populares Españoles&quot; (1883), Francisco Rodríguez Marín notes lyrics referring to the then recent Hispano-Moroccan War (1859–1860), which were probably developed by the troops during the campaign to boost their morale, using an existing melody:
Some early versions of the lyrics refer to the confrontation between Spanish and Moroccan troops (popularly referred to as &quot;Moors&quot; by the Spanish) during the Hispano-Moroccan War, that reflect Spanish popular imagery during their development from 1859 to 1860.

One of the earliest written references to the song appears in the 1819 novel &quot;La Quijotita y su Prima&quot;, by Mexican writer and political journalist José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, in which it is suggested that:

Other early stanzas concern events such as the Carlist Wars (1833–1876) in Spain, and the French intervention in Mexico (1861).

The period of the Mexican Revolution, from 1910 to about 1920, saw the first major period of verse production for &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;, because both rebel and government forces invented political lyrics for the song. Many stanzas were added during that period, today associated mostly with Mexico.

===Revolutionary lyrics===
The Mexican Revolution was a period of great political upheaval, during which the majority of the stanzas known today were written. Political symbolism was a common theme in those verses, and explicit and implicit references were made to events of the conflict, major political figures, and the effects of the war on the civilians in general. Today, few pre-Revolution verses are known, and the most commonly quoted portion of the song are the two Villist anti-Huerta stanzas:

That version, popular among Villist soldiers, contains hidden political meanings, as is common for revolutionary songs. The cockroach represents President Victoriano Huerta, a notorious drunk who was considered a villain and traitor due to his part in the death of revolutionary President Francisco Madero.

Due to the multi-factional nature of the Mexican Revolution, competing versions were also common, including the Huertist, anti-Carranza stanza:

An example of two Zapatist stanzas is:

&quot;La Cucaracha&quot; was a popular tune among Mexican civilians at the time, and there are numerous examples of non-aligned political verses. Many were general complaints about the hardships created by the war, and were often written by pro-Zapatistas. Other non-aligned verses contained references to various factions, in a non-judgmental manner:

===La Cucaracha as a woman===
Soldiering has been a profession for women in Mexico since pre-Columbian times. Among the nicknames for women warriors, and camp followers, were &quot;Soldaderas&quot;, &quot;Adelitas&quot;, &quot;Juanas&quot;, and &quot;Cucarachas&quot;.

Soldiers in Porfirio Diaz&#x27;s army sang &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; about a &quot;soldadera&quot; who wanted money to go to the bullfights. In &quot;Mexican Military: Myth and History&quot;, Elizabeth Salas writes that, for the Villistas, &quot;&#x27;La cucaracha&#x27; wanted money for alcohol and marijuana. She was often so drunk or stoned that she could not walk straight. Unlike corridos about male revolutionaries like Villa and Zapata, none of the well-known &quot;corridos&quot; about &quot;soldaderas&quot; give their real names or are biographical. Consequently, there are very few stanzas that ring true about women in battle or the camps.&quot;

===Other verses===
Apart from verses making explicit or implicit reference to historical events, hundreds of other verses exist. Some are new, and others are ancient, but the lack of references and the largely oral tradition of the song, makes dating the verses difficult, if not impossible. Some examples are:


==Influences==

In the novel &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell, the animals&#x27; rebellion song, &quot;Beasts of England&quot;, is described as a blend of the tunes of &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; and &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot;.

FC Utrecht has a long history of playing the tune at home games after the team has scored.

This song is a theme song of a kiddie gag show, &quot;Goin Bulilit&quot;.

<doc id="657978" wikidata="Q5052587" url="?curid=657978" title="Catherine Chidgey">
<text>Catherine Chidgey (born 8 April 1970) is a New Zealand novelist, short-story writer and university lecturer. She has published eight novels. Her honours include the inaugural Prize in Modern Letters; the Katherine Mansfield Fellowship to Menton, France; Best First Book at both the New Zealand Book Awards and the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize (South East Asia and Pacific Region); the Acorn Foundation Fiction Prize at the Ockham New Zealand Book Awards on two occasions; and the Janet Frame Fiction Prize.

==Early life and family==
Chidgey was born in Auckland and grew up in the Hutt Valley. At Victoria University of Wellington she completed a BSc in Psychology, and a BA in German Language and Literature. In 1993 she was awarded a German Academic Exchange Service scholarship to study at the Freie Universität Berlin. She returned to Victoria University in 1997 to complete an MA in Creative Writing under Bill Manhire.

 she lives in Hamilton with her husband and daughter. Chidgey has explained that the 13-year gap between her third and fourth novels was due to infertility issues keeping her from writing; she and her husband finally had their daughter in 2015.

== Career ==
===Early novels===
Her debut novel, &quot;In a Fishbone Church&quot;, was published in 1998 and was widely praised in New Zealand and overseas, winning the Hubert Church Award for Best First Book of Fiction at the New Zealand Book Awards in 1998. The writer Nick Hornby said &quot;Catherine Chidgey is a wonderful new talent, and &quot;In a Fishbone Church&quot; marks the beginning of what promises to be a glorious literary career&quot;. Louis de Bernières called the novel &quot;warm, subtle and evocative. You will be thinking about it long after you have finished reading&quot;. In 1999 &quot;In a Fishbone Church&quot; won Best First Book at the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize (South East Asia and Pacific Region). It also won a Betty Trask Award for a first book (UK), and was longlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction (UK).

Her second novel, &quot;Golden Deeds&quot;, was published in 2000, and was runner-up for the Deutz Medal for Fiction at the 2000 New Zealand Book Awards. It was published by Picador in the UK and by Henry Holt in the US (under the title &quot;The Strength of the Sun&quot;), where it was a 2002 Notable Book of the Year in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book Review, and a 2002 Best Book in the &quot;LA Times&quot; Book Review. The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; called it &quot;magnanimous and merciless, a work reminiscent at times of darkest Atwood ... A witty and melancholy alchemy of heat and chill, a work of craft and fluency, which revitalizes the book in all its guises ... for those who love books, Catherine Chidgey is a find&quot;. The &quot;Sunday Express&quot; called it &quot;a wonderful, gripping read. Human relations and needs are explored in all their complexity. Chidgey proves herself to be among that elite group of authors who possess a true grasp of the patterns of life&quot;. &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; said the novel &quot;ensnares you, creeps up and snaffles you with its small, tense concerns. I could not stop thinking about it. I could not put it down ... I finished &quot;Golden Deeds&quot; with that delicious and rare feeling: that I was in the presence of a proper, grown-up storyteller who cared not a toss for gimmicks or manifestoes, but dared instead to put her case with real authorial power and verve&quot;.

&quot;The Transformation&quot;, Chidgey&#x27;s third novel, was published in 2003, and that year she was named New Zealand&#x27;s best novelist under forty by &quot;The New Zealand Listener&quot;. The book tells the story of a shadowy Parisian wig-maker who flees to Tampa, Florida in the 1890s. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; said that &quot;Chidgey spins a horror story which, miraculously avoiding easy sensationalism, is both troubling and haunting&quot;, and the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; said it was &quot;her third and best so far ... Chidgey could tackle any subject and produce something wonderful from it. She has that gift of the imagination that finds metaphor, contiguity and paradox wherever she looks, and a seemingly innate feel for structuring events, times and historical detail to make one whole, satisfying narrative out of a myriad unexpected parts&quot;. &quot;The Sunday Express&quot; remarked, &quot;This really is a novel to get lost in ... A highly original read, as beautiful as it is terrifying, which manages to be riotously chilling without ever going over the top&quot;.

===Later novels===
Her fourth novel, &quot;The Wish Child&quot;, set in Nazi Germany, was published in New Zealand in 2016 and was a bestseller, winning the 2017 Acorn Foundation Fiction Prize at the Ockham New Zealand Book Awards—the country&#x27;s richest literary prize. Radio New Zealand called it &quot;a brilliant, brilliant novel ... a masterpiece&quot;. The &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; found it &quot;meticulously crafted and superbly written ... provocative, haunting, intelligent and lyrical ... breath-taking... It will stay with you long after you finish the final page&quot;. The &quot;Sunday Star-Times&quot; commented &quot;Right from the first sentences I was caught up in the exquisite lure of the writing: musical, clear, lovingly tended. Nothing seems forced ... I loved this book with its subterranean mysteries and spiky issues. I love the way, at this critical point in the world, when fundamental human values are violated, &quot;The Wish Child&quot; reminds us with grace and understated wisdom of a need to strive for universal good. I ached as I read. This novel is unmissable&quot;. It was published in the UK in July 2017 by Chatto &amp; Windus, with &quot;The Times&quot; calling it &quot;a remarkable book with a stunningly original twist&quot;. In October 2018 Counterpoint published it in the US as a lead Fall title.

Her fifth book was released in November 2017. A &#x27;found&#x27; novel, &quot;The Beat of the Pendulum&quot; was written during 2016, with Chidgey drawing on newspaper articles, Facebook posts, emails, radio broadcasts, books, street signs and conversations to create an entry for every day of the year. Radio New Zealand selected it as a Best Book of 2017, calling it &quot;Important in terms of its form as much as its content ... sensationally clever writing ... an enormously skilled writer who totally gets the craft&quot;. It was longlisted for the Ockham New Zealand Book Awards and was published in the UK by Lightning Books in 2019.

Chidgey&#x27;s sixth book, &quot;Remote Sympathy&quot;, was published in 2020, and like &quot;The Wish Child&quot; is set in Nazi Germany. It was shortlisted for the 2021 Ockham New Zealand Book Awards. It was a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Book of the Month, and was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;immersive, profound and beautifully plotted&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised Chidgey&#x27;s exploration of the intersecting stories of former Nazis and Holocaust survivors, concluding: &quot;With its multiple registers and complex view of humanity, this marks a vital turn in Holocaust literature&quot;. It was one of New Zealand&#x27;s top ten best-selling novels in 2021, was shortlisted for the 2022 International Dublin Literary Award, and was longlisted for the 2022 Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction. In 2022 it was named by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of the best books of the year.

In October 2022, her seventh novel, &quot;The Axeman&#x27;s Carnival&quot;, was published. Set in Central Otago, the novel tells the story of the relationship of a farming couple and is narrated by a magpie called Tama. Chidgey drew from her husband&#x27;s family&#x27;s farming experiences in writing the novel. Rachael King, reviewing the book for &quot;Newsroom&quot;, described it as &quot;remarkable, brilliant, a classic in the making&quot;, with Tama&#x27;s voice providing &quot;dark poetry, dramatic irony, startling wisdom and trickster delights&quot;. The book featured eighth on the list of New Zealand fiction bestsellers of 2022, and won New Zealand&#x27;s top book award, the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Fiction, at the 2023 Ockham New Zealand Book Awards.

In 2023, her eighth novel, &quot;Pet&quot;, a thriller about the relationship between a 12-year-old girl and her schoolteacher, was published in New Zealand, the UK and the United States. Ruth Franklin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;lingering, haunting book&quot;, and &quot;a landmark in the small but potent canon of contemporary novels about unusual girls reckoning with themselves and the world around them&quot;.

==Other works==
, Chidgey is a senior lecturer of creative writing at the University of Waikato and has also taught at the Manukau Institute of Technology. In her role at Waikato she founded the Sargeson Prize, New Zealand&#x27;s richest short story competition.

Chidgey has translated more than a dozen children&#x27;s picture books from the German for Gecko Press. In November 2019, OneTree House published her first original picture book, &quot;Jiffy, Cat Detective&quot;, illustrated by Astrid Matijasevich. A follow-up, &quot;Jiffy&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, was published in 2022.

<text>The Nambu Line () is a Japanese railway line which connects Tachikawa Station in Tachikawa, Tokyo and Kawasaki Station in Kawasaki, Kanagawa. For most of its length, it parallels the Tama River, the natural border between Tokyo and Kanagawa prefectures. It lies along the Tama Hills. It is part of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) network. The line forms part of what JR East refers to as the &quot;Tokyo Mega Loop&quot; () around Tokyo, consisting of the Keiyo Line, Musashino Line, Nambu Line, and the Yokohama Line. The name refers to the southern () part of the ancient province of Musashi () (now Tokyo and northern Kanagawa prefecture), through which the Nambu Line runs.

==History==
The private Nambu Railway opened the line in five stages between 1927 and 1930 (freight branches are omitted):
* 27 March 1927: Kawasaki – Noborito
* 1 November 1927: Noborito – Ōmaru (near Minami-Tama)
* 11 December 1928: Ōmaru – Bubaigawara (then called Yashikibun)
* 11 December 1929: Bubaigawara – Tachikawa
* 25 March 1930: Shitte – Hama-Kawasaki

Passenger trains utilised electric multiple units (EMUs) from the beginning. Freight initially consisted primarily of gravel hauled from the Tama River. When the railway reached Tachikawa and made connection with the Ōme Electric Railway, limestone became one of the main freight commodities. The railway was controlled by Asano zaibatsu, which enabled the transport of limestone from its own quarry in Western Tokyo to its cement plant in Kawasaki without using the government railways.

On 1 April 1944, the railway was nationalised by the imperial government and became the Nambu Line of Japanese Government Railways. After the end of World War II, there were several calls for the privatisation of the line, but the line remained a part of the Japanese National Railways (JNR) until its privatization in 1987.

The postwar growth of the Tokyo urban area resulted in the conversion of most of the farmlands along the Nambu Line into residential areas and increased the passenger traffic on the line. Freight traffic reduced after the opening of the Musashino Line (parallel to the Nambu Line) in 1976 and the discontinuance of the limestone freight in 1998, except for the Nambu Branchline, which remains a major freight route.

Limited-stop &quot;Rapid&quot; services between Kawasaki and Noborito with stops at Musashi-Kosugi and Musashi-Mizonokuchi started on 15 December 1969, but were discontinued by the timetable revision on 2 October 1978. After 33 years, Rapid services between Kawasaki and Tachikawa with more stops started on 9 April 2011, postponed from the originally scheduled 12 March due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

On 20 August 2016, station numbering was introduced with Nambu line stations being assigned station numbers between JN01 and JN26. Numbers increase towards in the westbound direction towards Tachikawa. In addition, station numbers JN51 to JN54 were assigned to the branch line stations with numbers increasing in the direction of Hama-Kawasaki.

Starting in March 2025, Nambu line will run using driver-only operation(One-person operation).

<doc id="657988" wikidata="Q3267569" url="?curid=657988" title="Water mass">
<text>An oceanographic water mass is an identifiable body of water with a common formation history which has physical properties distinct from surrounding water. Properties include temperature, salinity, chemical - isotopic ratios, and other physical quantities which are conservative flow tracers. Water mass is also identified by its non-conservative flow tracers such as silicate, nitrate, oxygen, and phosphate.

Water masses are generally distinguished not only by their respective tracers but also by their location in the Worlds&#x27; oceans. Water masses are also distinguished by their vertical position so that there are surface water masses, intermediate water masses and deep water masses.

== Global water masses ==
Common water masses in the world ocean are:

* Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW): Antarctic Bottom Water is a very important water mass. Antarctic Bottom Water is the left over part when sea ice is being made. It is very cold but, not quite freezing so the water moves down and along the ocean floor.
* North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) 
* Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) 
* Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) 
* Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) 
* Arctic Intermediate Water (AIW) 
* North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) 
* The central waters of various oceanic basins 
* Various ocean surface waters.

== Characteristics of water masses ==
Although there are many types of water masses, they all share characteristics. Water Masses are formed from regions of water having different temperatures. When ice is being formed in a cold climate like Antarctica, the cold temperatures separate the molecular bonds of the water causing it to become less dense. However, because water increases its volume by about 9% when frozen, this makes the ice less dense than the water which is why glaciers float. This also in turn causes the salinity of the water to decrease. The salinity of the water makes water freeze at lower temperatures than freshwater. Freshwater freezes at the standard 0 °C (32 °F), while saltwater freezes at an average of -2 °C (28.4 °F).

== Water mass classification ==
=== Temperature and salinity diagram ===

The best method of classifying a water mass is through using a T-S diagram. In the diagram pictured at the top, it categorises a water mass by the temperature and salinity of the water and is represented by a single point. However, water masses are not constant. Throughout time climates can change, seasons can drag out, or there could be less rainfall meaning that the water masses might change in temperature or salinity. To have a complete water mass classification, it requires the water type of the source and the standard deviations of the temperature and salinity. It can take many years to establish the standard deviations of the water mass and requires constant surveillance. Once all of the necessary measures are completed, the data will now determine what the current density of the water is and help further classify the water mass.

<doc id="658010" wikidata="Q5380819" url="?curid=658010" title="Entry (cards)">
<text>An entry, in trick-taking card games such as bridge, is a means of gaining the lead in a particular hand, i.e. winning the trick in that hand. Gaining the lead when some other player (including one&#x27;s partner) led to the previous trick is referred to as &quot;entering&quot; one&#x27;s hand; a card that wins a trick to which another player made the lead (except to the last trick) is therefore known as an &quot;entry card&quot;.

==Example==

If South declares this hand at notrump and the opening lead is a club, he will probably take just nine tricks with the top cards in his hand. Although the dummy holds the top six spades, they can win no tricks unless someone leads a spade; South has no spades, and so cannot do so and the opponents are unlikely to do so either. If South had just one spade (and one less card elsewhere), he could play it as a means of entering the North hand, enabling it to win six spades tricks.

On the same deal, if South declares with hearts as trump, he has a good chance of making 13 tricks on any lead. For example, if a club is led, he wins the ace in his hand, plays two rounds of trump and then leads the three of clubs which he ruffs in dummy - an entry play. Unless the defense can ruff one of the next three top spade leads from dummy, South&#x27;s three small diamonds can be discarded on the three top spades. A diamond is subsequently lead from dummy to enter the South hand with the ace of diamonds, followed by the remaining trump and the king of diamonds.

<text>The Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā (Sanskrit; ), also known simply as the Triṃśikā or occasionally by its English translation Thirty Verses on Manifestation Only, is a brief poetic treatise by the Indian Buddhist monk Vasubandhu. It was composed in the 4th or 5th century CE and became one of the core texts for the Yogācāra school of Mahāyāna Buddhism. In it he touches on foundational Yogācāra concepts such as the storehouse consciousness, the afflicted mental consciousness, and the three natures, among others. Together with the &quot;Vimśatikā&quot; form a standard summary of Vasubandhu&#x27;s understanding of Yogācāra.

== Manuscripts and translations ==
The &quot;Triṃśikā&quot; was translated into Chinese by Xuanzang in 648 CE at Hongfu Monastery. It was also translated into Tibetan in antiquity. A version in the original Sanskrit also survives.

== Commentaries ==
In India, the most influential commentary on the &quot;Triṃśikā&quot; was written by Sthiramati in the 6th century. According to Xuanzang, who studied the &quot;Triṃśikā&quot; at Nalanda in the 7th century under Śīlabhadra, there were 10 known prose commentaries on the text. These were by Sthiramati, Dharmapala of Nalanda, Nanda, Citrabhānu, Guṇamati, Jinamitra, Jñānamitra, Jñānacandra, Bandhuśrī, Śuddhacandra, and Jinaputra. Xuanzang initially intended to translate all of these, but on the advice of his students, especially Kuiji, Xuanzang instead chose to combine them into a single text that focused primarily on Dharmapala&#x27;s commentary. He did so because his teacher Śīlabhadra was a student of Dharmapala, and thus Xuanzang believed Dharmapala&#x27;s interpretation to be the most accurate. Among the others commentators, Xuanzang most often included excerpts from Sthiramati, Nanda, and Citrabhānu, but usually only to provide contrast with Dharmapala. The result of this work was the &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot;, which became the most important text for the tradition of East Asian Yogācāra. Xuanzang&#x27;s student Kuiji in turn created his own commentary on this text, the Cheng weishi lun shuji.

After Xuanzang&#x27;s pilgrimage, Indian commentary on the &quot;Triṃśikā&quot; continued to be produced. In the late 7th century or early 8th century, Vinītadeva, also working at Nalanda, produced commentaries on both the &quot;Triṃśikā&quot; and the &quot;Vimśatikā&quot; which survive in Tibetan translation and some Sanskrit fragments.

<text>The Jaz drive is a removable hard disk storage system sold by the Iomega company from 1995 to 2002.

Following the success of the Iomega Zip drive, which in its original version stores data on high-capacity floppy disks with 100 MB nominal capacity, and later 250 and then 750 MB, the company developed and released the Jaz drive. First shipping to OEMs in December 1995, the Jaz drive featured 1 GB capacity per removable disk. A new Jaz drive model, released in February 1998, increased the individual disk capacity to 2 GB.

The Jaz drive uses a SCSI interface, with both internal and external drive models. Iomega produced a Jaz Jet SCSI adapter PCI card for PCs. Iomega also produced a number of external adapters, including the Jaz Traveller interface that connected it to a standard parallel port, and, later, a SCSI-USB adapter and SCSI-Firewire adapter. An ATA version of the drive was planned but never released.

==Reception==
The Jaz never attained as much success or market penetration as the Zip drive. While the Zip drive was marketed as a high-capacity floppy disk for the home and small office/home office (SOHO) markets, the Jaz drive was originally advertised as a higher-end product. SCSIs were standard in Apple Macintosh computers but were rare in the much larger market of end-user PCs, usually requiring an extra interface card to be bought and installed. The rising popularity and decreasing price of CD-R/CD-RW drives greatly hurt the success of the Jaz drive, offering a much lower price-per-megabyte and the convenience of the CD media being readable in almost any standard CD-ROM drive.

==Problems==
Earlier Jaz drives could overheat, and loading-mechanism jams could leave a disk stuck in the drive. This became known in the profession as the &quot;click of death&quot;, because of clicking sound it made as it tried and failed to eject the disc. Forcibly ejecting a stuck disk could destroy both the drive and disk. Jaz drives are hard-disk technology, making them susceptible to contaminants in the drive; dust and grit could be introduced through a hole in the disk case where the motor drove the platters, and any dust built up on the external case could enter the drive with its next insertion. Additionally, the metal sliding door was capable of wearing the plastic, resulting in debris and head crashes.

Furthermore, the mechanism used to attach the platters to the spindle motor was complex and tended to vibrate noisily. Iomega implemented an anti-gyro device (much like an optical CD/DVD drive) within the cartridge to prevent vibration at spin-up, but this device lost effectiveness with age. As a result, the two platters could lose alignment, rendering the cartridge unusable. The plastic tabs attached to the bottom of a Jaz cartridge could become stripped or broken, rendering the inserted disk physically incapable of spinning up to operating speed. Some drives also had firmware problems.

==Legacy==
The later Iomega REV drive tried to use similar technology to address the same market segment that the Jaz drive had reached. The REV&#x27;s design is derived partly from the IBM 2310&#x27;s use of a &quot;voice coil actuator (VCA) motor to improve the reliability and reduce the seek time of an HDD&#x27;s read–write heads&quot; in a removable media cartridge. It also is derived from the IBM 3340&#x27;s use of &quot;low-cost, low-load, landing read/write heads with lubricated disks&quot;. Neither the Jaz drive nor the REV drive copied the IBM 3340 in making the heads a part of the cartridge, although the REV drive moved the motor into the cartridge—which the IBM 3340 had not done. It was left to the RDX Technology drive to move the heads into the cartridge, which increased reliability by essentially making the cartridge an electro-mechanical duplicate of a modern external disk drive.

<text>The FN Minimi (short for ; &quot;mini machine gun&quot;) is a Belgian 5.56mm or 7.62mm light machine gun, also classified as a squad automatic weapon developed by Ernest Vervier for FN Herstal. Introduced in the late 1970s, it is in service in more than 75 countries. The weapon is manufactured at the FN facility in Herstal and their U.S. subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC.

The Minimi fires from an open bolt. It is an air-cooled, gas operated long-stroke piston weapon that is capable of fully automatic fire only. It can be belt fed or fired from a magazine. The Minimi is configured in several variants: the Standard model as a platoon or squad support weapon, the shortened Para version for paratroopers and the Vehicle model as secondary armament for fighting vehicles.

==Design details==
===Operating mechanism===

The Minimi uses a gas-actuated long-stroke piston system. The barrel is locked with a rotary bolt, equipped with two massive locking lugs, forced into battery by a helical camming guide in the bolt carrier. Upon firing, the piston is forced to the rear by expanding propellant gases bled through a port in the barrel near the muzzle end. The piston rod acts against the bolt carrier, which begins its rearward motion guided on two rails welded to the receiver walls, while the bolt itself remains locked. This sequence provides a slight delay that ensures chamber pressure has dropped to a safe level by the time a cam in the bolt carrier rotates and unlocks the bolt, increasing extraction reliability as the empty cartridge casing has had the time to cool down and contract, exerting less friction against the chamber walls.

The Minimi fires from an open bolt, which reduces the danger of a round cooking off after extended periods of continuous fire, since a cartridge is only momentarily introduced into the chamber prior to ignition, and the movement of the bolt and bolt carrier forces air through the chamber and barrel after each shot, ventilating the barrel and removing heat. Gas escaping the gas cylinder is directed upward, avoiding kicking up dust and debris that would reveal the shooter&#x27;s position.

===Features===

The Minimi has a manually adjustable gas valve with two positions, normal and adverse. The adverse setting increases the cyclic rate of fire from 700–850 rounds per minute to 950–1,150 rounds per minute and is used only in extreme environmental conditions or when heavy fouling is present in the weapon&#x27;s gas tube. The spring extractor is located inside the bolt, while the tilting lever ejector is contained inside the receiver housing. Spent casings are removed through a port located at the bottom of the right side of the receiver, protected from debris with a spring-loaded dust cover. The Minimi is striker-fired and the bolt carrier functions as the striker mechanism.

The Minimi has a push-button type manual safety installed in the trigger housing, above the pistol grip. In the &quot;weapon safe&quot; position, it disables the sear mechanism; pushing the button to the right side exposes a red-coloured rim on the left side of the firearm and indicates the weapon is ready to fire. The black polymer pistol grip from the FAL and FNC rifles was initially used, but the Minimi is currently fitted with a modified grip with lateral grooves, installed at a smaller angle to the receiver.

The Minimi features a welded receiver made from stamped steel. Both the standard and Para variants are equipped with a fixed, folding bipod mounted to the gas tube and stowed under the handguard. The bipod can be adjusted in height and each leg has three height settings. The bipod also offers a 15° range of rotation to either side. With the bipod fully extended, the bore axis is elevated to a height of . The Minimi can also be fired from the Belgian FN360° tripod or the American M122 mount using an M60 pintle. The vehicle-mounted Minimi is fitted with an electrically powered trigger that enables it to be fired remotely from within an armoured fighting vehicle.
The standard light machine gun version has a barrel and a skeletonized aluminium stock with a folding wire shoulder strap. The shortened Para model has a barrel and a collapsible metal stock, while the vehicle-mounted model has a barrel but does not have a stock or iron sights. All models can alternatively be fitted with a fixed synthetic stock, the same used on the M249, which contains a hydraulic buffer that contributes to stabilizing the rate of fire and reducing recoil forces.

===Feeding===
The weapon is fed from the left-hand side by disintegrating-link M27 ammunition belts (a miniaturized version of the 7.62mm M13 belt), from either an unsupported loose belt, enclosed in a polymer ammunition box with a 200-round capacity attached to the base of the receiver, or from detachable STANAG magazines, used in other NATO 5.56 mm assault rifles such as the M16 and FNC. Magazine feeding is used only as an auxiliary measure, when belted ammunition has been exhausted. The ammunition belt is introduced into the feed tray, magazines are seated inside the magazine port at a 45° angle, located beneath the feed tray port. When a belt is placed in the feed tray it covers the magazine port. Likewise, a magazine inserted into the magazine well will prevent the simultaneous insertion of a belt. The magazine port, when not in use, is closed with an L-shaped hinged flap equipped with a tooth, which engages a corresponding opening in the magazine and serves as a magazine release. This feature was developed by FN&#x27;s Maurice V. Bourlet and allows the Minimi to be instantly changed from belt feed to magazine feed without any modification.

The pawl-type feeding mechanism is modelled on the system used in the MAG general-purpose machine gun, which was originally used in the World War II-era MG 42. The belt is moved in two stages during both the forward and rearward movement of the reciprocating bolt carrier, which provides for a smooth and continuous feeding cycle. The feeding mechanism top cover features a device that indicates the presence of a cartridge in the feed path.

===Barrel===

The barrels used in the Minimi have an increased heat capacity for sustained fire, feature a chrome-lined rifled bore (six right-hand grooves) and are manufactured in two versions: with a 178 mm (1:7 in) twist rate used to stabilize the heavier Belgian 5.56×45mm SS109 projectile, or a 305 mm (1:12 in) twist for use with American M193 ammunition. The barrels have a quick-change capability; a lever is provided on the left side of the weapon that unlocks the barrel allowing the shooter to push it forward removing it from its trunnion. A carrying handle is also fixed to the barrel and assists in the barrel change process. A trained soldier can perform a barrel change and ready the weapon for aimed fire in 6 to 7 seconds. Early models of the Minimi had a flash suppressor with side ports as seen on the FN FAL, FN CAL, and FN FNC rifles; new production guns have a shorter, cone-shaped slotted flash suppressor.

===Sights===
Both the standard and Para models come with a rear sight, adjustable for windage and elevation, that provides a peep aperture for ranges from , in increments. The sight line radius is . The hooded front sight is installed in a post on the gas block and is also adjustable for elevation and windage. Early models of the Minimi had the rear sight mounted forward of the feed cover and the front post secured to the barrel, closer to the muzzle end. An adapter can also be used that allows the use of standard NATO night and day sights.

===Accessories===
Standard equipment supplied with the Minimi consists of three ammunition boxes, a cleaning kit stored inside the forearm, lubricant bottle, sling and blank-firing barrel.

==Variants==
===M249===


The M249 version of the Minimi was adopted by the US military in 1982; since 1984, production for the US military has been carried out entirely in the US by a local subsidiary, FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina.

As part of the US military&#x27;s M249 Product Improvement Program (PIP), the M249 was updated with: a new synthetic stock and modified buffer assembly, a single-position gas regulator, a so-called birdcage type flash hider/compensator from the M16A2, a polymer barrel heat guard, and a folding carry handle. As a result, the weapon&#x27;s weight increased to . Many of the PIP upgrades were later incorporated by FN for the Minimi.

A lightweight variant of the Para with a Picatinny top cover rail adapter is known as the Minimi Special Purpose Weapon (SPW). It had the magazine feed port removed to further reduce weight, and a railed MIL-STD-1913 handguard was used that enables the use of standard tactical accessories.

Another variant of the SPW requested by the US Special Operations Forces is the Mk 46 Mod 0 that incorporates a lightweight fluted barrel but lacks the magazine feed system, vehicle mounting lugs and carry handle. A railed forearm ensures modularity and mission-adaptability permitting the use of flashlights, vertical grips, and infrared laser designators. An improved variant known as the Mk 46 Mod 1 with an improved forward rail and lightweight titanium bipod has been adopted by the United States Navy.

===Minimi 7.62===


The Minimi prototype was originally designed in 7.62×51mm NATO, and later redesigned for the 5.56 mm cartridge. When the USSOCOM issued the requirements for the Mk 48 Mod 0 in the early 2000s, the original plans for the Minimi were retrieved and used to develop this new model. As a result of favourable reviews of the Mk 48 Mod 0 and increasing demand for a more powerful variant of the Minimi, FN Herstal introduced the Minimi 7.62. In November 2006, a FN Herstal press release said the Minimi 7.62 had recently been &quot;launched onto the market&quot; and was available &quot;with a fixed or telescopic buttstock and a standard or triple rail handguard&quot;. Apart from the different caliber, the Minimi 7.62 incorporates a non-adjustable, self-regulating gas system and a hydraulic recoil buffer in the buttstock assembly. The Minimi 7.62 also has a different sight setup calibrated for the larger cartridge. The rear sight is adjustable from , in increments. The sight can also be corrected for windage. The Minimi 7.62 TR is a variant equipped with a Picatinny rail handguard from the factory. In Australian service, the Minimi 7.62 is known as the &quot;Maximi&quot;.

===Japanese version===


Sumitomo Heavy Industries conducts licensed production, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) have adopted it under the name 5.56mm Machine Gun MINIMI (5.56mm機関銃MINIMI) The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) began procurement from the 1993 fiscal year as a successor to the Type 62 7.62mm machine gun, and by the 2017 fiscal year, they had procured 4,922 units. The procurement price was approximately 2 million yen. Not only the JGSDF, but also the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) has procured it for base security units and self-defense weapons for the UH-60J, while the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) has procured it as an onboard weapon for escort ships. The license-produced MINIMI can be equipped with the Type 62 GPMG tripod using a special attachment, and is used when precise shooting is required. Additionally, for long-range shooting, a “direct sight scope” (scope) may be mounted. There are also examples of attaching low-light night vision devices. The model adopted by the JSDF is the so-called standard type with a metal tube stock, and it has unique modifications such as a different shape for the barrel change lever. The side of the gun body is marked with 5.56mm Machine Gun MINIMI. A distinctive feature is the unique heat cover (upper sleeve) mounted on the top of the barrel. This cover, similar to the M249 used by US Military, is an added component that became equipped after adoption. However, the number of cooling vents in the central column has been reduced from 8 (on the original version) to 7, indicating a shape difference. Furthermore, the magazine stop for STANAG magazines is not used because it prevents training with blank rounds. 

On December 18, 2013, the Ministry of Defense announced that Sumitomo Heavy Industries had falsified inspection data over several decades and had delivered machine guns that did not meet the required performance standards. As a result, the company was placed under a 5-month suspension of designation. It is reported that at least 5,350 units, including 12.7mm heavy machine guns, 7.62mm machine guns, and 5.56mm machine guns, were delivered since 1979. Even before the data falsification was discovered, personnel in the field had recognized that the MINIMI produced by Sumitomo Heavy Industries was of low performance. 

In April 2021, Sumitomo Heavy Industries announced its withdrawal from the production of machine guns and the development of 5.56mm machine guns due to budget constraints and reduced order volumes. However, the company stated it would continue producing parts for maintenance and repair. Due to the obsolescence of the MINIMI Mk1 and the cessation of procurement, the JGSDF conducted a selection for its next machine gun. The JGSDF decided to continue using the 5.56mm caliber and chose the MINIMI Mk3 over Germany’s Heckler &amp; Koch MG4. The “5.56mm Machine Gun MINIMI(B)” is being procured not through domestic production, but via imports. The procurement plan includes 3,100 units of MINIMI(B), which will replace the existing MINIMI Mk1 over time, including an additional procurement of approximately 800 units that had not been previously acquired. 

===Minimi Mk3===
In November 2013, FN Herstal unveiled the Mk3 version of the Minimi light machine gun the Minimi 5.56 Mk3 and the Minimi 7.62 Mk3. The Mk3 upgrades were based on operational experience and user feedback over the past 10 to 15 years. The stock is 5-position adjustable that is also adjustable for cheek rest height with a folding shoulder rest and hydraulic buffer. The feed tray has retaining pawls to hold ammunition from the belt in place while loading. The handguard has three forward picatinny rails. A new bipod is 3-position height adjustable and seamlessly integrates into the shape of the handguard when folded back regardless of accessories that may be attached. Others features include a more ergonomic cocking handle and an optional heat shield, enabled by an added on long pin, to protect from barrel heat. The Minimi 7.62 Mk3 can be converted to fire 5.56×45mm rounds. Users that already have Minimi machine guns can partially or completely upgrade their existing weapons with the Mk3 features.

===Production in other countries===
The Minimi is being licence-built in Canada, Australia, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, Sweden, Greece and Switzerland by Colt Canada, Lithgow Arms, Beretta, Pindad, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Bofors Carl Gustaf, and Astra Arms S.A. respectively.

Copies of the Minimi have been produced for export by Norinco and made by Changfeng Machinery Co., Ltd in China without license, designated as in 2011, and chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO. Another clone, known as the XY 5.56, is made by Yunnan Xiyi Industry Company Limited. This was supposed to be mistaken for the CS/LM8 when news of the weapon was made in 2008.

Taiwan also produced the Minimi without license, as the &quot;T75&quot;. In addition, Egypt also produces the Minimi under license.

<doc id="658049" wikidata="Q428688" url="?curid=658049" title="Dodge Challenger">
<text>The Dodge Challenger is the name of three generations of automobiles produced by the American automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge dates back to 1959 for marketing a &quot;value version&quot; of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.

From model years 1970 to 1974, the first-generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing significant components with the Plymouth Barracuda.

The second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda / Sapporo, a coupe version of an economical compact car.

The third and current generation is a full-size muscle car that was introduced in early 2008 initially as a rival to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro.

In November 2021, Stellantis announced that the 2023 model year would be the final model year for both the LD Dodge Charger and LA Dodge Challenger, as the company will focus its plans on electric vehicles rather than fossil fuel-powered vehicles, due to tougher emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency for the 2023 model year. Challenger production ended on December 22, 2023, and the Brampton, Ontario, assembly plant will be re-tooled to assemble an electrified successor.
==First generation (1970–1974)==

The E-body Challenger was introduced in the autumn of 1969 for the 1970 model year, similar in appearance to but somewhat larger than its less expensive, platform-sharing Plymouth sibling, the Barracuda. It was positioned to compete against the Mercury Cougar and Pontiac Firebird in the upper end of the pony car market, a large and lucrative niche of two-door sport coupes that the Ford Mustang had pioneered in April 1964. Like the Barracuda, it was available in a wide variety of trim and option levels. In spite of its premium price, size, and market placement, Chrysler intended the new Challenger to be the most potent pony car ever, and virtually every engine in its inventory (including the famed 426 Hemi) was made available. 

The vehicle was all new, but Dodge had used the Challenger name for a two-door 1959 Dodge Coronet coupe called the Silver Challenger.

The 1970 Challenger&#x27;s longer wheelbase, larger dimensions, and more luxurious interior than the Mustang or its smaller Chrysler products stablemate, the Baracuda, were prompted by the launch of the upscale 1967 Mercury Cougar, a bigger, better appointed, and more expensive pony car aimed at affluent young American buyers. The wheelbase was longer than the Barracuda&#x27;s, and the Dodge differed in its sheet metal, much as the Cougar differed from the shorter-wheelbase Mustang. Air conditioning and a rear window defogger were optional. With 1971 being the sole exception, the front ends of both cars differed from each other in that the Challenger had four headlights and the Barracuda had only two. 

The exterior design was penned by Carl Cameron, who was also responsible for the exterior designs of the 1966 Dodge Charger. Cameron based the 1970 Challenger grille on an older sketch of a stillborn 1966 Charger prototype that was to have a turbine engine. The pony car segment was already declining by the time the Challenger arrived. Sales fell dramatically after 1970, and though sales rose for the 1973 model year with over 27,800 cars being sold, Challenger production ceased midway through the 1974 model year. A total of 165,437 first-generation Challengers were sold.

==Second generation (1978–1983)==
Beginning with the 1978 model year, Dodge marketed a rebadged variant of the early Mitsubishi Galant Lambda coupe as the Dodge Challenger — through Dodge dealers as a captive import, initially as the &quot;Dodge Colt Challenger&quot;. Chrysler&#x27;s Plymouth brand marketed its rebadged variant as the Plymouth Sapporo, and a rebadged variant was marketed overseas as the Mitsubishi Sapporo/Scorpion and sold.

The Sapporo and Challenger were redesigned in 1981 with revised bodywork with increased footroom, headroom, trunk capacity, and soundproofing. Both cars were marketed until 1983, when they were replaced by the Conquest using the same rear-wheel-drive platform through 1989, and in 1984 by the front-wheel-drive Laser and Daytona.

The car retained the frameless hardtop styling of the old Challenger, but had smaller engines, a 1.6 L inline-four and a 2.6 L inline-four instead of the slant-6 and V8 engines of the original Challenger models. The engines were rated at power outputs of . Mitsubishi pioneered the use of balance shafts to help damp engine vibrations.

==Third generation (2008–2023)==

In late 2005, Dodge teased spy photos of the third-generation Dodge Challenger prototype on the internet, which was announced on November 21, 2005, with an official sketch of the vehicle. The Dodge Challenger Concept was unveiled at the 2006 North American International Auto Show; production started in 2008. Many design cues of the Dodge Challenger Concept were adapted from the 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T.

==Racing==
The Challenger was introduced to the SCCA Trans Am Series in 1970. Two factory-backed cars were prepared by Ray Caldwell&#x27;s Autodynamics and driven by Sam Posey and Tony Adamowicz. The No.77 car was built at Autodynamics from a street Challenger T/A taken from a local dealer showroom. The No.76 chassis arrived mid-season from Dan Gurney&#x27;s All-American Racers and was completed by Autodynamics.
* Dodge&#x27;s early to mid-1970s factory-supported &quot;Kit Car&quot; program for short-track late-model stock car racing offered a choice of Challenger, and a few (less than 12) were made. Still, in 1974, Dodge ended the Challenger line, and they went to the Dodge Dart Sports and Dodge Aspen bodies over a steel-tube chassis.
* Blackforest Motorsports has currently entered a Challenger in the Continental Challenge.
* The Challenger R/T has been used as the Chrysler model for starting in 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series competition.

With Dodge officially out of NASCAR at the end of the 2012 season, the remaining cars and racing parts have been bought up by &quot;privateer&quot; racing teams and continue to show up in Nationwide Series during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. J. J. Yeley indicated his two-car team would continue to field a Challenger in the series for as long as he can find parts to keep the cars running. The team stopped after the 2014 season after his No. 93 (later No. 28) regularly ran in the top 20 during races. However, the Mike Harmon-owned No. 74, and the Derek White-operated No. 40 qualified and ran Dodges in 2015. Mike Harmon Racing ran a Dodge the entire season and also did so in 2016, and has raced in over half of the 2017 season so far. Likewise, White&#x27;s MBM Motorsports team fielded the Nos. 13 and 40 as Dodges in some races. MBM continues to field Dodges into 2018 with Timmy Hill in the 66 (was the 13).

In late 2014, two Challengers fielded by Miller Racing with the support of SRT and Mopar, driven by Cameron Lawrence and Joe Stevens, started racing in the Trans-Am Series TA2 class. Both cars used a spec Howe road racing tube chassis with fiberglass bodies. Powered by a Hemi 392 slightly modified for road racing extremes and restricted by class rules, the cars made around 500 horsepower. Except for the slightly bulged fenders and a large rear wing, the cars look much like the stock/street version despite being roughly 7/8s the size of the road car. Lawrence won four of the twelve races in the 2015 season, finishing third overall in the Trans Am TA2 championship.
Joe Stevens in the No. 11 &quot;Green Car&quot; finished sixth overall after fourth place at the season finale at Daytona International Speedway. Joe Stevens also received the Cool Shirt Hard Charger award for his excellent rookie season performance. For the 2016 season, the Stevens-Miller Team fielded three Challengers in the TA2 series and ran in 16 events, scoring a few wins. The No. 77 car was painted in a throw-back scheme similar to the 1970 No. 77 car driven by Sam Posey. The No. 12 car occasionally fielded a blue scheme paying tribute to the Plymouth Cuda Trans-Am car driven by Swede Savage.

In March 2017, the Challenger returned to compete at Sebring after a nearly 40-year absence from Trans-Am&#x27;s fastest racing class TA class in Tra. Jeff Hinkle drove it under the American V8 Road Racing team with John Debenedictis as crew chief. The car was orange and purple with stripes of many of the other challenger colors to celebrate the current stable of cars for the street. It is powered by a Penske Engines Mopar R5 / P7 carbureted engine producing . In its debut, it qualified 16th and finished 9th out of 24.

At all Superbike World Championship races in the United States, Fiat&#x27;s Alfa Romeo safety car is replaced with Chrysler&#x27;s Dodge Challenger.

== Discontinuation and future plans ==
On August 15, 2022, Stellantis formally announced that Dodge Challenger, Charger, and Chrysler 300 production would end following the 2023 model year, stating tightening U.S. EPA emissions requirements as reasons for doing so. In response, the company announced a series of &quot;Last-Call&quot; models with special paint and unique trims to commemorate the Challenger and Charger. The final Dodge Challenger, a Pitch-Black Demon 170, rolled off the Brampton assembly line on December 22, 2023; it was also the very last vehicle built on a derivative of the long-running Chrysler LX Platform, which was introduced in 2004 for the 2005 model year. After production, the Brampton, Ontario assembly plant will be re-tooled to assemble electric vehicles and the next-generation Jeep Compass.

While it is currently unknown whether the Challenger name will return on a future vehicle, Stellantis announced that an electrified successor to both the Charger and Challenger would be introduced in 2024 for the 2025 model year in the form of a three-door liftback, utilizing the Charger name. Moreover, the company announced that the all-new electric power plants will produce 455 horsepower on the base model and over 800 horsepower using the &quot;Banshee&quot; 800-volt power plant. An internal combustion version is rumored to be offered as well, utilizing the twin-turbocharged 3.0L &quot;Hurricane&quot; inline-6 engine, shared with the Jeep Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer and 2025 Ram 1500; it is set to be paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission.

<text>Saugatuck Dunes State Park is a public recreation area covering on the shore of Lake Michigan between Saugatuck and Holland in Allegan County, Michigan.

==History==
The site was once part of the estate of inventor Dorr E. Felt, whose summer home, the Felt Mansion, is an in-holding within the state park that is undergoing restoration. Built by the inventor of the comptometer in 1928, the Felt&#x27;s summer home was sold to the St. Augustine Seminary in 1949 and used as housing for young students, and later on, for cloistered nuns. In the 1970s, the building was purchased by the state of Michigan and used as a state police post, with nearby buildings serving as a prison. The state completed purchasing the site for state park purposes in 1978.

==Activities and amenities==
The largely undeveloped state park features of hiking trails, sand dunes covered with trees and grass, and of beachfront located two-thirds of a mile from the picnic parking area.

<text>The Gulf or Bay of Honduras is a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea, indenting the coasts of Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. From north to south, it runs for approximately 200 km (125 miles) from Dangriga, Belize, to La Ceiba, Honduras.

The inner Gulf of Honduras is lined by the Belize Barrier Reef which forms the southern part of the 900 km (600 mile) long Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the second-largest coral reef system in the world. The Belize Barrier Reef includes a number of small islands, called cays, and collectively known as the Pelican Cays.

The Gulf of Honduras is marked by complex dynamics of coastal and open waters, and ocean currents, which have produced a very diverse and unique ecosystem with a wide variety of coastal marine waters, including coastline estuaries, barrier beaches, lagoons, intertidal salt marshes, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, keys and barrier reefs.

The gulf receives the runoff from the watersheds of 12 rivers with an estimated discharge of 1,232,000 litres (approx. 300,000 gallons) per second.

Tourists are often taken on boat trips to the Pelican Cays, notably Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye.

In 1961 Hurricane Hattie swept across the Gulf of Honduras, destroying buildings in Belize.

The infamous pirate Blackbeard spent the winter of 1717–1718 harassing shipping boats sailing to and from the port of Vera Cruz, Mexico and traversing the Bay of Honduras. In April 1718, at Turneffe Atoll, Blackbeard captured the logwood cutting sloop &quot;Adventure&quot; and forced its captain, David Herriot, to join him. Blackbeard then made Israel Hands captain of the &quot;Adventure&quot; and began sailing for North Carolina.

== Extent ==
=== Current ===
The Gulf&#x27;s limits have not been demarcated by the International Hydrographic Organization. Its northernmost point is variously given as Belize City, Dangriga, or Gladden Spit; its easternmost point as Punta Sal, Punta Izopo, or La Ceiba. The northern limits are in the Belize or Stann Creek districts of Belize, while the eastern ones are in the Atlántida Department of Honduras.

=== Historical ===
During the 16th through 20th centuries, the Gulf&#x27;s limits were thought to run from Cape Catoche to Cape Gracias a Dios.

==== 20th century ====
In 1012 December 1989, the Central American Integration System established the Commission for the Environment and Development, a body charged with coordinating environmental protection policies, projects, and programmes across the region. Upon the 12 October 1994 signing of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America, the Commission adopted its first regional environmental management plan. In 1995 and 2005, the Commission secured grant financing for its work in the Gulf.

In 1996, nine NGOs in Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras established the Trinational Alliance for the Conservation of the Gulf of Honduras (aka TRIGOH). The alliance seeks to harmonise members&#x27; management policies for marine and coastal protected areas in the Gulf, and to coordinate their management and research activities.

== Geography ==
=== Political ===
=== Physical ===
==== Terrestrial ====
The Gulf&#x27;s northern (ie Belizean) shores consist mostly of sandy beach ridges, saline tidal swamps, and shelf lagoons. It is dotted with small estuaries, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, patch and barrier reefs, and mangrove and coral cayes. The coast in the mouth of the Gulf (ie Guatemalan coastline) consists mainly of mangrove thickets, large estuaries, seagrass beds, and beaches. The southern coast (in Honduras) is marked by long beaches, vast mangroves, and mangrove and coral cays.

==== Marine ====
The Gulf&#x27;s continental shelf extends some 9.32–24.85 miles (15–40 km) from shore. The northern shelf holds part of the Belize Barrier Reef, which stretches to the Sapodilla Cayes. The shelf in the mouth of the Gulf holds five parallel submarine ridges of continental origin, which jut out towards the north-northeast. It is cleaved by the Swan Island fault, which divides the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates, and forms the southern boundary of the Cayman Trough.

== Climate ==
The Gulf&#x27;s climate is tropical or sub-tropical (ie &quot;Am&quot; and &quot;Af&quot; Köppen climate classifications). Temperature varies little throughout the year, averaging , though this is slightly moderated to by cold northerlies and trade winds blowing from North America during the winter months. Rainfall and humidity are seasonal; rainfall averages per month during the JuneOctober wet season, and per month during the NovemberMay dry season. The wet season is brought by the annual northern migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Rainfall and humidity additionally vary by location, with some 118–157 inches (3,000–4,000 mm) of annual rainfall in the coastal areas, and some in the Maya Mountains. The northeasterly trade winds are the most dominant influence on the Gulf&#x27;s annual wind pattern; their speeds range from to per second. Tropical storms and hurricanes are regular between August and October, with the Gulf&#x27;s northeastern (ie Belizean) section averaging 60 storms per century, and the southwestern coast (ie Guatemalan and Honduran) averaging 20 storms per century.

== Geology ==
=== Terrestrial ===
The Gulf&#x27;s northern (ie Belizean) coast consists primarily of three geologic formations metamorphosed sediments (ie &quot;metasediments&quot;) and granite intrusions in the Maya Mountains, and coastal alluvial sediments east, southeast, and south of this range. The metasediments are the oldest rocks in Belize, formed during the Palaeozoic era some 300 mya. They form part of the Santa Rosa Group, and are composed of fine-grained phyllites, slates, and mudstones. The alluvial sediments formed during the Tertiary period some 10 mya. Primary soil types are Ossory (from metasediments), Stopper (from granite), Melinda and Puletan (from alluvial sediment), and tintal soils (ie wet, swampy type soils). The Belize Barrier Reef protects this coast from open sea waves. As such, the north-south littoral drift along this coast is primarily driven by waves formed within the reef.

The coast at the mouth of the Gulf (ie Guatemalan coast) consists primarily of alluvial material from the Quaternary era. The southern (ie Honduran) coast consists primarily of sedimentary alluvium (surficial bounders, cobbles, gravel, sand, and mud) and intrusive plutonic formations of granite, granodiorite, and diorite. These formed during the Quaternary and Cretaceous eras. The west-east littoral drift along this coast is driven mainly by open sea waves, which tend to approach the shoreline from east to west.

=== Marine ===
The Gulf is part of the Cayman Trench, one of five deepwater basins in the Caribbean Sea. It contains the open-sea lagoon formed by the Belize Barrier Reef, the Amatique Bay, the Atlantic coast of Guatemala, and the eastern part of the coast of Honduras. The western part of the Gulf sits on the continental shelf, which extends offshore, and so is rather shallow, with mean depths of less than . Large freshwater discharge from the Sarstoon, Dulce, and Motagua rivers limit coral development in the mouth of the Gulf to a few isolated patches, as at Hunting Caye, for instance. Towards the northeastern section of the Gulf, the continental shelf drops off abruptly, from some 98 feet at the shelf break to some 6,560 feet in the Cayman Trench.

=== Formation ===
The Gulf&#x27;s northern coast, upon the Yucatan Peninsula, reached its present location during the Late Jurassic age some 150 Mya. It was joined by the Central American platform during the Eocene epoch some 40 Mya, thereby forming a gulf or bay in or about the present location of the Gulf of Honduras.

== Hydrology ==
=== Watersheds ===
Eight primary, and 17 subsidiary, watersheds replenish the Gulf. These cover some , with 2,240 sq. mi. in Belize, 7,070 sq. mi. in Guatemala, and 11,430 sq. mi. in Honduras. They contain 13 major, and various minor, rivers, with the former discharging some of freshwater per second, on average, and the latter, some 7,060 cubic feet per second, on average. Annually, the Gulf receives some 17.75–18.23 cubic miles (74–76 km3) of water from its watersheds. Sedimentary discharge from Belizean rivers into the Gulf was, on average, 80, 15, and 5 per cent mud, clay, and sand, respectively. Peak freshwater and sedimentary discharge occurs in the wet season, which usually exceeds dry season discharge by a factor of 59.


=== Currents ===
The Gulf&#x27;s open sea experiences the Caribbean Current and a quasi-permanent cyclonic eddy generated in the southwest corner of the Cayman Tranch. The latter is centred at about 19°N 86°W, generating a sea surface height anomaly of negative , with peripheral current velocities of 7.9 to 15.8 inches per second (0.2–0.4 m/s).

The Caribbean Current flows from east to west in the deep waters off the continental shelf of Honduras. In doing so, every few months, it generates cyclonic, counterclockwise gyres, characterised by a central water level depression of 812 inches (2030 cm), which take 23 months to progress westwards along the Honduran coast towards the Belize Barrier Reef.

Along the Gulf&#x27;s northern (ie Belizean) coast, persistent northeasterly trade winds maintain a constant southerly downwelling, with speeds of 3.9 to 7.9 inches per second (0.1–0.2 m/s). This southern drift, in turn, drives a counterclockwise eddy along the Gulf&#x27;s mouth, and along its southern coast (ie the Guatemalan and Honduran coasts).

=== Tides ===
The Gulf experiences a mixed, mainly semidiurnal microtide with a mean sea surface elevation range of some . The semidiurnal and diurnal constituent amplitudes range within 1.182.76 inches (0.030.07 m). The dominant semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents propagate westwards along the coast of Honduras, and northwards along the Belize Barrier Reef. Currents induced by the tide may be appreciable in constricted channels along the Belize Barrier Reef, reaching 15.75 inches per second (0.4 m/s) here. Astronomical tides are weak, and at times completely dominated by meteorological tides. For instance, the storm surge associated with Hurricane Mitch raised the mean water level at Gladden Spit 9.2 feet (2.8 m) on 27 October 1998.

=== Waves ===
The northeasterly and easterly trade winds give rise to both wind waves and swell, especially during December–May. These are intensified by cold northerlies and north-westerlies blowing in from North America during November–April in bursts lasting one to three days. Waves are typically 3.28–9.84 feet (1–3 m) high, with periods of 3–7 seconds, though hurricanes may increase their height to 32.81 feet (10 m), and their period to 12.7 seconds. Mean wave direction is towards 255° (ie towards the west-southwest). The wet season&#x27;s thunderstorms are often accompanied by intense gusts from varying directions, followed by periods of calm.

=== Water ===
Sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf range from in JanuaryFebruary to in AugustSeptember, with the former lower temperatures associated with coastal upwelling driven by intensified trade winds. The Gulf&#x27;s upper mixed layer, which has uniform temperature and salinity, is about in its northwest section, featuring temperatures of to . A thermocline develops offshore at 49 to 66 feet (15 to 20 m). Sea-surface salinity in the Gulf averages 36,200 parts per million (36.2 g per kg) offshore, but drops off closer towards the coast, and especially near estuaries like the Amatique Bay, where salinity dips to 5,000–10,000 ppm (5–10 g/kg) during the wet season. Visibility in the Gulf ranges from less than near estuaries to a maximum of inside the Belize Barrier Reef. Dissolved oxygen ranges from 0.9 ppm (0.9 mg/L) near coastal areas of wastewater discharge, to 5.2–9.6 ppm (5.2–9.6 mg/L) near the Belize Barrier Reef. pH ranges from 5.8 in areas without marine vegetation (eg seagrass beds), to 7.4 in lagoons and estuaries, to 8.8 near coral reefs. Nitrate and phosphate concentrations range from levels below the detection threshold (near coral reefs), to 7.0 μM and 1.0 μM respectively (near estuaries). Chlorophyll-a concentrations range from undetectable to 0.55 ppm (0.55 mg/L).

== Ecology ==
=== Ecosystems ===
The most significant ecosystems in the Gulf are mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and coral reefs, these being some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth, in terms of mean net primary productivity, and some of the most vulnerable to changes in water quality.

==== Mangrove forests ====
The Gulf&#x27;s mangrove forests are dominated by red mangroves, though black, white, and buttonwood mangroves are also present. Mangrove stands act as sediment traps in estuaries, thereby protecting coral reefs from sedimentation, and providing a primary source of nutrition and a nursery habitat for coastal marine life. They also act as a physical buffer from tropical storms for inland settlements. The largest forests sit on the Sarstoon–Temash, and the Port Honduras–Payne&#x27;s Creek areas (on the southern coast of Belize, and the Atlantic coast of Guatemala). Smaller forests are located near Livingston, Dulce River, Puerto Barrios, Punta de Manabique, and in the Jeanette Kawas National Park. Mangrove stands cover at least of land in Belize, and some of Guatemala&#x27;s Atlantic coast.

==== Seagrass beds ====
The Gulf&#x27;s seagrass beds are dominated by turtle grass, though shoal, manatee, and tape grasses also appear. Seagrass meadows are predominantly found in clear, sandy-bottomed, surf-free, shallow waters, as found off the coast of Belize, in the Amatique Bay, and in Graciosa Bay. They cover some of the Gulf, reaching a density of some 133 plants per square foot (1,433 plants per m2). They provide a source of nutrition for marine life, and help stabilise the coast. In Belize, they serve as an important habitat for queen conch, the country&#x27;s second-most important commercial fish species.

==== Coral reefs ====

The most significant coral reefs in the Gulf are those of the Belize Barrier Reef, itself part of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, the second-largest reef in the world. It is composed of lagoon patch reefs, fringing reefs, and offshore atolls. It is home to some 60 coral, 350 mollusc, and 500 fish species. Isolated coral patches dot the Guatemalan and Honduran coasts of the Gulf.

=== Biodiversity ===
The Gulf&#x27;s marine life is particularly diverse. It is home to a number of threatened and endangered marine species, most notably West Indian manatees, and green, leatherback, and hawksbill turtles.
=== Protection ===
Belize was the first country in the Gulf to establish a system of protected areas. The Crown Lands Ordinance of 1924 authorised the Governor-in-Council to classify some Crown land as protected areas. The first area so classified was the Half Moon Caye Crown Reserve, a bird sanctuary established on 1 September 1928. Guatemala and Honduras established protected areas by the 1990s. Over 43, 29, and 27 per cent of the territory of Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras, respectively, are under some form of protection. Efforts to establish an international protected area in the Gulf have been hindered by the Belizean–Guatemalan territorial dispute.
== Economy ==
=== Demographics ===
The Gulf proper encompasses the Toledo and Stann Creek districts of Belize, the Izabal department of Guatemala, and the Cortés and Atlántida departments of Honduras, though the Gulf&#x27;s watersheds encompass additional districts and departments. These districts are predominantly rural, ethnically diverse, and agrarian.

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture is the dominant economic activity in the Gulf, employing over 30 per cent of the labour force in Belize&#x27;s southern districts, for instance. Agriculture is undertaken both for subsistence and for commerce, with coffee, cacao, and bananas being the lead exports. Bananas are an important export in all three countries of the Gulf, while coffee is a major product of Guatemala and Honduras. Smallholders tend to focus on maize, beans, and &quot;maicillo&quot;.

=== Fisheries ===
The Gulf sustains a number of commercially-fished species, including shrimp, spiny lobster, queen conch, and scale fish (eg swordfish, jurel, sea bass, barracuda, tuna, &quot;pejerrey&quot;, and anchovy). Some 14.3 million pounds of fish are caught in the Gulf each year, worth some $22.8 million ( million USD), with spiny lobster, queen conch, shrimp, and sardines being the major earners. The Belizean coast is particularly known for its shrimping grounds, especially off the Moho, Temash, and Sarstoon rivers, where over 150,000 pounds of shrimp are caught annually by some 200 small-scale fishermen and 10 large-scale trawlers. In the southern coast of the Gulf, some 1,415 Guatemalan and 647 Honduran small-scale fisherman are active.

=== Aquaculture ===
Four aquaculture farms operate on the Belizean coast of the Gulf. These predominantly grow whiteleg shrimp. In 1999, these farms grew prawn in 107 ponds spanning 722 acres, with an annual production of over two million pounds for local consumption and export.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism is the second-largest foreign exchange earner in the Gulf countries. In Belize, tourism has historically focussed on cayes and reefs in the northern part of the country, outside the Gulf. In 2001, for instance, only 11.1 per cent of tourists were destined towards the country&#x27;s southern districts, accounting for only 6 per cent of income derived from tourist accommodation. Activities were primarily eco-cultural, with the main attractions being Mayan archaeological sites and various marine and coastal parks. Tourism infrastructure in the Guatemalan and Honduran coasts is more limited (with the exception of the Honduran Bay Islands).

=== Transport ===
The major port facilities in the Gulf are the Big Creek and Belize City ports in Belize, Puerto Barrios and Puerto Santo Tomás in Guatemala, and Puerto Cortés in Honduras, with the Honduran port being the only deepwater port in Central America, and one of the best equipped for cargo. In 2001, these ports accommodated nearly 4,000 ships and 12 million metric tonnes of cargo.
=== Industry ===
Industrial manufacturing is limited in the Gulf, particularly in the Belizean coast, where the only major factories in 2003 were two citrus and one rice processing plants. Guatemalan and Honduran manufacturing are heavily concentrated on the Gulf&#x27;s watersheds.

<doc id="658061" wikidata="Q385398" url="?curid=658061" title="Ōme Line">
<text>The is a railway line operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in western Tokyo, Japan. It links Tachikawa and the Chūō Line with the town of Okutama. Many Chūō Line trains operate via the Ōme Line to Ōme Station, providing a direct service to Tokyo Station.

The section between Ōme and Oku-Tama is now nicknamed as the &quot;Tokyo Adventure Line (東京アドベンチャーライン)&quot;.

==Services==
=== Ōme Line Local ===
Local trains stop at all stations. However, they rarely run along the entire Ōme Line, with services splitting at Ōme Station.

=== Through services ===
The Ōme Line, at times, runs through services along the Chūō Rapid, Itsukaichi, and Hachikō lines. Supplemental trains during the peak season may also run along the Nambu Line. Trains that operate only on the Ōme Line have &quot;Ōme-Itsukaichi Line&quot; displayed at the front.

* Chūō - Ōme Line through service: Some Chūō Line trains operate through service to the Ōme Line via Tachikawa. Most through services only go as far as Ōme, and stop at all stations on the Ōme Line, except the &quot;Holiday Rapid Okutama&quot; (See below). There are two other through service variations which uses the Ōme Line as an intermediate line, which are shown below.
** Chūō - Ōme - Itsukaichi Line through service: At rush hours, few Chūō Line trains run through services between Tokyo and the Itsukaichi Line via Haijima. These services are always joined with another through service train, which couples / decouples at Haijima. During morning rush, some trains from Musashi-Itsukaichi on the Itsukaichi Line, and another train from Ōme on the Ōme Line, or from Hakonegasaki / Komagawa on the Hachiko Line, couple at Haijima, and head for Tokyo. During evening rush, the reverse occurs.
** Chūō - Ōme - Hachiko Line through service: As mentioned above, there are through services from Tokyo on the Chūō Line to the Hachiko Line, via the Ōme Line. These trains terminate at Hakonegasaki or Komagawa.
* Ōme - Itsukaichi Line through service: Some Itsukaichi Line operate through service to the Ōme Line via Haijima. They operate between Musashi-Itsukaichi and Tachikawa. Note that these trains do not go on the Chūō Line.

=== &quot;Ōme Limited Express&quot; ===
The Ōme Limited Express (特急おうめ) is a limited express train service for commuters on the Chūō Rapid Line and Ōme Line. The train operates on weekdays only. Prior to 16 March 2019, this train operated as the Ōme Liner (青梅ライナー).

=== &quot;Holiday Rapid Okutama&quot; ===

&quot;Holiday Rapid Okutama&quot; services run on weekends from Tokyo.

== Station list ==
* All stations are located in Tokyo.
* Local, rapid, and special rapid trains stop at all stations.
* On the track column, stations where trains can pass one another are marked &quot;∥&quot;, &quot;◇&quot;, &quot;∨&quot;, and &quot;∧&quot;, and those where trains cannot pass each other at stations marked &quot;｜&quot;.

== Rolling stock ==
* E233-0 series
* &quot;209-1000 series&quot;

Services on the Ōme Line are usually formed of E233-0 series 10-car / 6+4 car EMUs. However, while 209-1000 series trains usually only run on the Chuo Line (Rapid) between Tokyo and Takao stations, on rare occasions (such as a shortage of train sets due to an accident) they may also run on the Ome Line as far as Ome station. Due to the lack of passenger-operated door controls on these sets all doors open at each station on these sets.

==History==
The section between Tachikawa and Ōme was opened in 1894 by the Ōme Railway as a gauge line, extended 2 km as a freight-only section to Hinatawada the following year. Passenger services were extended to Hinatawada in 1898, and the line was converted to in 1908. A further freight-only section opened to Miyanohira in 1914, and to Futamatao in 1920. Passenger services were extended to Miyanohira in 1923, the same year the entire line was electrified at 1,200 V DC. The line was further extended to Mitake in 1929, when the company changed its name to the Ōme Electric Railway Co. and the voltage raised to 1,500 V DC in 1930. Passenger services were extended to Mitake in 1935.

The company was nationalized on 1 April 1944, the same year that the Tachikawa to Nagakami section was double-tracked.

The Okutama Electric Railway was constructing a line from Mitake to Hikawa (now Okutama) when it was nationalised, and the line opened on 1 July 1944, creating the present-day Ōme Line.

The Nakagami to Haijima section was double-tracked in 1946, and direct services to Tokyo commenced in 1949. The Haijima to Higashi-Ōme section was double-tracked between 1961 and 1962, CTC signalling was commissioned in 1971, and freight services ceased in 1998.

On 20 August 2016, station numbering was introduced to the Ōme Line, with stations being assigned station numbers between JC51 (Nishi-Tachikawa) and JC74 (Oku-Tama).

From the timetable revision on 18 March 2023, operation on the Ōme Line has been almost completely divided at Ōme Station, with very few trains operating along the entire length of the line.

===Former connecting lines===
* Oku-Tama Station: The Tokyo Waterworks Bureau operated a 7 km line to the Ogouchi dam during its construction between 1952 and 1957. It featured 23 tunnels and 23 bridges. In 1963 it was transferred to the Seibu Railway, which transferred it to the Okutama Limestone Quarrying Co. in 1978, and although the line is now known as the Mizune Freight Line, it has been out of service for some time.

==Future developments==
In February 2015, JR East announced plans to introduce Green (first class) cars on Chuo Line (Rapid) and through-running Ome Line services from fiscal 2020. This will involve adding two bilevel Green cars to 10- and 6-car E233-0 series EMU sets, forming 12- and 8-car sets. Work is now undergoing to lengthen station platforms and depot facilities to handle the longer trains.

<doc id="658063" wikidata="Q1016935" url="?curid=658063" title="Giffnock">
<text>Giffnock (; ; , ) is a town and the administrative centre of East Renfrewshire in the Central Lowlands of Scotland.

It lies east of Barrhead, east-southeast of Paisley and northwest of East Kilbride, at the southwest of the Greater Glasgow conurbation.

Giffnock has frequently been named amongst the most affluent areas in Scotland. It had been first place but that title went to Stockbridge, Edinburgh in 2020.

Giffnock is mentioned in documents as early as the seventeenth century as a scattered agricultural settlement. In the late eighteenth century, Archibald Montgomerie, the Earl of Eglinton, was forced to partition the land into a number of smaller properties.

The urbanisation and development of Giffnock began in the mid to late nineteenth century with the construction of several sandstone quarries, and this prompted the development of the first railway link with nearby Glasgow. Large-scale quarrying continued in Giffnock for almost a century. However, the quarrying ceased by the 1920s, and other uses were found for the quarries. An additional railway service began at the start of the twentieth century, closely followed by the arrival of Glasgow Corporation Tramways. Giffnock&#x27;s relative closeness to Glasgow coupled with the local industry and good transports links helped it to develop into a suburban town, as many wealthy merchants chose to construct villas in its smog-free environs and commute daily to the city. 
Although heavy industry died out in the area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland&#x27;s densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a dormitory town, supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents in the early twentieth century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much of the land is now urbanised or designated parkland, leaving little room for further expansion.

==History==
The Scottish Gaelic name for Giffnock is Giofnag and is of partially Brythonic and Gaelic origin. &#x27;Cefn&#x27; (i.e. &#x27;Giff&#x27;) comes from the Brythonic meaning &#x27;ridge&#x27; and the Gaelic &quot;cnoc&quot; (i.e. &#x27;nock&#x27;) meaning &quot;hill&quot;. In Gaelic, &quot;oc&quot; or &quot;og&quot; is a diminutive, and thus when added to &quot;cefn&quot; gives Giffnock the meaning of &quot;Little Ridge&quot;.

The first written mention of Giffnock came in 1530, when James V presented Rockend (Ruken) Mill and the surrounding lands to Hugh Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Eglinton.
The settlement of Giffnock first appeared as Gisnock, in an atlas created by Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in 1654, the first atlas of Scotland. Giffnock was primarily a scattered farming community until the late 1780s, when Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton was forced to partition the land into a number of small properties for sale to raise finances.

===Industry===
In 1835, the first sandstone quarry in Giffnock opened. Before long, the town became known for this industry, and at its peak, there were four quarries in Giffnock, three surface quarries and one underground quarry, which together employed over 1,000 men. The quarries produced two types of sandstone: &quot;liver rock&quot; and &quot;moor rock&quot;. &quot;Liver rock&quot; was particularly popular with masons thanks to its lack of stratification, which made the stone easy to work with.

In 1854 Giffnock and Orchard Quarries were taken over by the former foreman and clerk, De Hort Baird and William Stevenson. They formed the firm Baird &amp; Stevenson, which became a major force in Scottish quarrying; they later owned Locharbriggs Quarry in Dumfriesshire, thus supplying Glasgow with both blond Giffnock and red Dumfries sandstone. By 1866 the Busby Railway was built, allowing them to transport the stone by rail. Originally, a lower level line was laid from Giffnock railway station into the Orchard Quarry to facilitate the extraction of the stone.

Sandstone from the Giffnock quarries was primarily used within the nearby city of Glasgow and can be found in older parts of the University of Glasgow and the interior of Kelvingrove Art Gallery. A small amount of trade was done with Belfast, and some of the finer &quot;liver rock&quot; was even transported as far as America and South Africa to build both buildings and monuments.

Quarrying in Giffnock continued until 1912 when, due to flooding and the high cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue that needed to be resolved. In the early 1930s, William Bearmore &amp; Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries. The slag tipping continued until 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s. Today the ground is a wasteland.

Coal mining was also carried out in Giffnock, between 1850 and 1926. The coal produced was of a very poor quality and was of little value to householders. The main use of Giffnock coal was with commercial and industrial customers such as Busby Gas Works.

===Urbanisation and expansion===
The opening of Giffnock railway station in 1866 allowed business people to build sandstone villas and commute daily to the city. At the time, it was much more desirable to live in Giffnock than to live in the smog-polluted city. By the early 1890s, residential Giffnock began to grow around the railway station and Eastwood Toll, and by 1892 gas was introduced to the area. Gas street lamps were erected by Busby and District Gas Company in 1893; however, these were supported by a voluntary subscription that many households refused to pay, leaving many areas unlit. It was not until October 1896, when Eastwood Parish Council took over street lighting, that the area was consistently lit at night.

In 1903, two more railway stations were built on the edge of Giffnock, at Williamwood and Whitecraigs. These stations lay on the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway, originally built to provide a through route from the Lanarkshire coalfields to ports such as Ardrossan on the Ayrshire coast.

The growth of Giffnock was furthered in 1905 by the arrival of the first Glasgow Corporation Tramways tram in the town. The addition of this tram link and the nearby Whitecraigs railway station helped the popularity of Giffnock as a weekend destination and lead to the opening of Rouken Glen park in 1906 by Archibald Corbett (later Lord Rowallan), the M.P. for Tradeston. The Giffnock tramline was one of Glasgow Corporation Tramways&#x27;s most profitable routes; up to 15,000 travelled to Giffnock on a Sunday to visit Rouken Glen.

During the great housing boom of the late 1930s, Giffnock began to grow rapidly. Between 1930 and 1940, as many as 3,000 dwellings were constructed, and the population rose dramatically, from 1,425 to 3,471 in 1939 and 9,144 in 1951.
On 7 May 1941, during the Greenock Blitz of World War II, the Nazi German Luftwaffe dropped a group of bombs over Giffnock, but only two houses were destroyed. 
On 10 May 1941, Rudolf Hess, a prominent Nazi politician and deputy to Adolf Hitler parachuted out of his Messerschmitt Bf 110D near Waterfoot. Hess had flown solo to Scotland in an attempt to negotiate peace with the United Kingdom. He was detained by the Home Guard in the battalion headquarters in the Giffnock Scout hall, where he was questioned by Major Donald, the Assistant Group Officer of the Glasgow Royal Observer Corps before being transferred to Maryhill Barracks in Glasgow the following day. The wreckage of Hess&#x27;s aircraft was salvaged by 63 Maintenance Unit (MU) between 11 and 16 May 1941. Part of the aeroplane is now in London&#x27;s Imperial War Museum.

Proposals were put forward in 2008 to expand the town with the building of 178 houses on the currently dangerous Braidbar Quarries site next to Huntly Park, involving the Park closing for a period of two years. However, following 2,000 objections from local people and the opposition of the Scottish Government&#x27;s reporter, East Renfrewshire Council abandoned the plans in October 2011.
==Governance==

Giffnock is represented by several tiers of elected government. Giffnock Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten community councils of the East Renfrewshire council area.

East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local council, is based in Giffnock and is the Executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Within East Renfrewshire, Giffnock and Thornliebank is one of five multi-member wards created in 2007, which elects three council members. For the purposes of the Scottish Parliament, Giffnock forms part of the Eastwood Constituency, which is represented by Jackson Carlaw MSP, of the Scottish Conservative Party. In the UK Parliament, Giffnock is within the county constituency of East Renfrewshire, electing one member of parliament (MP) to the House of Commons. Kirsten Oswald of the SNP was elected as MP for East Renfrewshire in the 2015 General Election. Before its creation in 2005, Giffnock was in the Eastwood Constituency.

==Geography==


At (55.803°, −4.30°) Giffnock is situated in Scotland&#x27;s Central Lowlands. The town lies east of Barrhead, northwest of East Kilbride and south-southwest of Glasgow. 
The territory of Giffnock is contiguous with Glasgow and forms part of Greater Glasgow, the United Kingdom&#x27;s fifth largest conurbation.

Giffnock is situated on the plateau that encircles Glasgow. It is at edge of the area that defines the basin that Glasgow has developed within. 
The underlay is composed mainly of sedimentary rocks and freestone from the Strathclyde and Clackmannan groups of early to mid Carboniferous age (354 to 316 million years). 
The relatively soft and easily eroded rocks have resulted in the landform in the area being mostly flat with gentle undulations.
The area of Giffnock is typically around to above sea level, with the highest point in the area reaching .

Giffnock experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year.

Giffnock&#x27;s built environment is characterised by its mixture of nineteenth and twentieth-century single and two-storey dwellings, most of which are semi-detached or terraced. Towards the south of Giffnock the properties are generally grander two-storey detached villas, commonly built with local sandstone many of which are now listed buildings.
Giffnock is a postal district within the post town of Glasgow in the G postcode area. Giffnock consists of postcode district G46, which also extends beyond the town boundary to include neighbouring settlements Kennishead, Thornliebank, Deaconsbank, Carnwadric and Arden.

==Demography==

According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, the census locality (town and sub-area) of Giffnock had a total resident population of 16,178, or 18% of the total of East Renfrewshire. The median age of males and females living in Giffnock was 39 and 43 respectively, compared to 37 and 39 years for those in the whole of Scotland. Fifty six percent were married, 3.5% were cohabiting couples, 6.9% were lone parent families and 28.7% of households were made up of individuals.

The place of birth of the towns residents was 94.4% United Kingdom (including 87.8% from Scotland), 0.6% Ireland, 0.9% from other European Union countries and 4.2% from elsewhere in the world. Compared with the average demographics of Scotland, Giffnock has higher proportions of people born outside the Europe and people over pensionable age.

Of residents 16–74, 39.6% were in full-time employment, 12.1% in part-time employment, 8.9% self-employed and 2% unemployed compared with Scotland as a whole which has 40.3%, 11.1%, 6.6% and 4% respectively. Additionally, in Giffnock 4.2% students have jobs while 5.2% do not, 16% are retired, 5.7% look after their home or family, 3.9% are permanently sick or disabled, and 2.4% are economically inactive for other reasons.

==Transport==

The area has a number of high-volume road links to neighbouring Glasgow. The A77 main Glasgow to Kilmarnock road passes through the centre of the town and crosses the A727 from Paisley to East Kilbride at the Eastwood Toll. The nearest motorway is the M77, of which Junction 3 Darnley is the interchange for Giffnock.

Giffnock lies within the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport Passenger transport executive and is served by three railway stations, all of which are managed by ScotRail: 
*Giffnock railway station, opened on 1 January 1866, lies on the East Kilbride branch of the Glasgow South Western Line, which runs from Glasgow Central north-northeast.
*Whitecraigs railway station, opened on 1 May 1903, lies on the Neilston branch of the Cathcart Circle south-southwest of Glasgow Central.
*Williamwood railway station, opened on 1 May 1903, lies on the Neilston branch of the Cathcart Circle south-southwest of Glasgow Central.

The closest airport is Glasgow Airport, north-west of Giffnock, followed by Glasgow Prestwick Airport, .

Giffnock is serviced by a number of bus routes by various operators. The main bus link to the city is the number 38 line operated by First Glasgow, which runs at least every 10 minutes throughout the day.

==Education==
The first evidence of education in Giffnock is of a small private school that operated in the lodge house at the Redhurst Hotel. Due to the increased population, the first public school opened in 1902 in the Tower Rooms of Giffnock United Free Church, known now as the Orchardhill Parish Church.

Giffnock has a number of high schools, including St Ninian&#x27;s High School, a co-educational Roman Catholic High School which was built in 1984 and is Scotland&#x27;s top-performing state school. St Ninian&#x27;s was the first state-funded school in Scotland to abandon the Standard Grade examination system in favour of the Higher Still system, using Access 3, Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 for pupils in third and fourth year, while maintaining Highers in fifth year and Advanced Highers in sixth year.
The school roll was 1784 as of September 2011.

Furthermore, Giffnock has a library and two primary schools: Giffnock Primary School and Braidbar Primary school, non-denominational feeder primary schools for Woodfarm High School.

==Culture and community==

===Religion===
Until the end of the nineteenth century, Giffnock had no church buildings, and religious meetings took place in the waiting room of Giffnock Railway Station and, later, in the clubhouse at Eastwood Golf Course. Orchardhill Parish Church, designed by HE Clifford and completed in 1899, was the first church built within Giffnock. Now a category B listed building, the Church is built in a Gothic revival style of architecture and is built mainly of locally quarried stone.
Also located in Giffnock is Giffnock Synagogue, founded in 1938 and home to the largest Jewish religious congregation in Scotland.

===Recreation===
In 1936 the Tudor Cinema was constructed in Giffnock by Alex Frutin. It opened in December as a &quot;superb suburban cinema&quot;. The Tudor was an Art Deco style building and is considered Glasgow&#x27;s first &quot;entertainment complex&quot;, featuring a ballroom and restaurant as well as the 2,400-seat cinema.

Giffnock has numerous parks, including Rouken Glen, Huntly Park and Eastwood Park, where the East Renfrewshire Council offices are based. There remains some ancient woodland in Giffnock, which could be as old as 8,000 years.
The lands of Rouken Glen Park originally belonged to the Scottish Crown. Ownership shifted to the Earl of Eglinton when James V presented the land to Hugh Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Eglinton on the marriage of his son in 1530. The area of the estate was farmed until the end of the 18th century and, in 1858, the estate was purchased by local merchant Walter Crum. Alexander Crum inherited the estate in 1879 and is responsible for the layout of Rouken Glen as it is today. On his sudden death in August 1893, the house passed into the hands of his brother, William Graham Crum, who later sold the estate to Archibald Cameron Corbett, MP (later Lord Rowallan) on 19 May 1905. In 1906 the estate was given to the City of Glasgow by Lord Rowallan, with the provision that it be for the &quot;citizens of Glasgow for all time&quot;. Rouken Glen Park was officially opened on Saturday, 25 May 1906 by Lord Rowallan.

Eastwood Park Leisure Centre has a 25-metre (82 ft) swimming pool, two additional smaller pools and two gyms. Activities in the leisure centre include casual swimming, swimming lessons, pool fun sessions, fitness classes, a sauna and gym sessions. 
Greenbank Garden, an 18th-century house and garden owned by the National Trust for Scotland, is located between nearby Clarkston and Newton Mearns. The house has a walled garden, sixteen rooms and barns and stables. This building is protected as a Category A listed building.

The Giffnock North Social Club, located on Braidbar Road, is a community non-profit making venue run by its members. The club host a wide and diverse range of live music events. Facilities at the club include a lounge and a games room with pool tables, darts and large screen TV. It also has a function hall which can be hired out for special occasions, accommodating up to 150 guests.

=== Sport ===
In 1905 the Whitecraigs Golf Club was founded. The course was originally designed by Willie Fernie, who was The Open Championship winner in 1883 and also designed the Ailsa course at Turnberry. Alterations to the course were made in the 1930s by James Braid, who won The Open Championship five times between 1901 and 1910.

Many golfing events have been hosted by the Whitecraigs Golf Club. The club was visited by the United States Ryder Cup teams of 1929 and 1933. The teams included many golfing legends such as Walter Hagen, Gene Sarazen and Horton Smith. Whitecraigs hosted the World Senior Championship in 1976 and 1978. In 1983, Jack Nicklaus visited the club to play an exhibition match and run a clinic.

Whitecraigs Rugby Club is a rugby union team based at Newton Mearns, near Giffnock. As of the 2011–2012 season, the team competes in the Scottish Premiership Division A.

The Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians RFC (often abbreviated to GHA) are based in Giffnock.

<doc id="658068" wikidata="Q10310534" url="?curid=658068" title="Infinitesimal transformation">
<text>In mathematics, an infinitesimal transformation is a limiting form of &quot;small&quot; transformation. For example one may talk about an infinitesimal rotation of a rigid body, in three-dimensional space. This is conventionally represented by a 3×3 skew-symmetric matrix &quot;A&quot;. It is not the matrix of an actual rotation in space; but for small real values of a parameter ε the transformation

:formula_1

is a small rotation, up to quantities of order ε2.

==History==
A comprehensive theory of infinitesimal transformations was first given by Sophus Lie. This was at the heart of his work, on what are now called Lie groups and their accompanying Lie algebras; and the identification of their role in geometry and especially the theory of differential equations. The properties of an abstract Lie algebra are exactly those definitive of infinitesimal transformations, just as the axioms of group theory embody symmetry. The term &quot;Lie algebra&quot; was introduced in 1934 by Hermann Weyl, for what had until then been known as the &quot;algebra of infinitesimal transformations&quot; of a Lie group.
==Examples==
For example, in the case of infinitesimal rotations, the Lie algebra structure is that provided by the cross product, once a skew-symmetric matrix has been identified with a 3-vector. This amounts to choosing an axis vector for the rotations; the defining Jacobi identity is a well-known property of cross products.

The earliest example of an infinitesimal transformation that may have been recognised as such was in Euler&#x27;s theorem on homogeneous functions. Here it is stated that a function &quot;F&quot; of &quot;n&quot; variables &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; that is homogeneous of degree &quot;r&quot;, satisfies

:formula_2

with

:formula_3

the Theta operator. That is, from the property

:formula_4

it is possible to differentiate with respect to λ and then set λ equal to 1. This then becomes a necessary condition on a smooth function &quot;F&quot; to have the homogeneity property; it is also sufficient (by using Schwartz distributions one can reduce the mathematical analysis considerations here). This setting is typical, in that there is a one-parameter group of scalings operating; and the information is coded in an infinitesimal transformation that is a first-order differential operator.

==Operator version of Taylor&#x27;s theorem==
The operator equation

:formula_5

where 

:formula_6

is an operator version of Taylor&#x27;s theorem — and is therefore only valid under &quot;caveats&quot; about &quot;f&quot; being an analytic function. Concentrating on the operator part, it shows that &quot;D&quot; is an infinitesimal transformation, generating translations of the real line via the exponential. In Lie&#x27;s theory, this is generalised a long way. Any connected Lie group can be built up by means of its infinitesimal generators (a basis for the Lie algebra of the group); with explicit if not always useful information given in the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula.

<doc id="658070" wikidata="Q3555069" url="?curid=658070" title="Cyprus Convention">
<text>The Cyprus Convention of 4 June 1878 was a secret agreement reached between Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire which granted administrative control of Cyprus to Britain (see British Cyprus), in exchange for its support of the Ottomans during the Congress of Berlin. Provisions in the Convention retained Ottoman rights over the territory of Cyprus. 

This agreement was the result of secret negotiations that took place earlier in 1878. The Convention was abrogated by the British on 5 November 1914, when Britain and the Ottoman Empire found themselves at war with each other.

==British administration established, 1878==

The Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, ceded the administration of Cyprus to Britain, in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression. The British had been offered Cyprus three times (in 1833, 1841, and 1845) before accepting it in 1878.

In the mid-1870s, Britain and other European powers were faced with preventing Russian expansion into areas controlled by a weakening Ottoman Empire. Russia was trying to fill the power vacuum by expanding the Czar&#x27;s empire west and south toward the warm water port of Constantinople and the Dardanelles. British administration of Cyprus was intended to forestall such an expansion. In June 1878, clandestine negotiations between Britain and the Porte culminated in the Cyprus Convention, by which &quot;His Imperial Majesty the Sultan further consents to assign the island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by England.&quot;

There was some opposition to the agreement in Britain, especially from Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone. When Gladstone returned to power he did not return the island. Greek Cypriot nationalism made its presence known to the new rulers, when, in a welcoming speech at Larnaca for the first British High Commissioner to Cyprus, the bishop of Kition expressed the hope that the British would expedite the unification of Cyprus and Greece as they had previously done with the Ionian Islands. Thus, the British were confronted at the very beginning of their administration with the reality that &quot;enosis&quot; was vital to many Greek Cypriots.

The island served Britain as a key military base on the sea route to British India, which was then Britain&#x27;s most important overseas possession. In 1906, a new harbour at Famagusta was completed, increasing the importance of Cyprus as a strategic naval outpost protecting the approaches to the Suez Canal. Early in the First World War the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers, and on 5 November 1914 Britain annexed Cyprus, bringing an end to the Convention.

==Cyprus Tribute==

The terms of the Convention provided that the excess of the island&#x27;s revenue over the expenditures for government should be paid as an &quot;annual fixed payment&quot; by Britain to the Sultan. This provision enabled the Porte to assert that it had not ceded or surrendered Cyprus to the British, but had merely temporarily turned over administration. Because of these terms, the action was sometimes described as a British leasing of the island. The &quot;Cyprus Tribute&quot; became a major source of discontent underlying later Cypriot unrest.

Negotiations eventually determined the sum of the annual fixed payment at exactly 92,799 pounds sterling, eleven shillings, and three pence. Governor of the island Ronald Storrs later wrote that the calculation of this sum was made with &quot;all that scrupulous exactitude characteristic of faked accounts.&quot; The Cypriots found themselves not only paying the tribute, but also covering the expenses incurred by the British colonial administration, creating a steady drain on an already poor economy.

From the start, the matter of the Cyprus Tribute was severely exacerbated by the fact that the money was never paid to Turkey. Instead it was deposited in the Bank of England to pay off Turkish Crimean War loans (guaranteed by both Britain and France) on which Turkey had defaulted. This arrangement greatly disturbed the Turks as well as the Cypriots. The small sum left over went into a contingency fund, which further irritated the Porte. Public opinion on Cyprus held that the Cypriots were being forced to pay a debt with which they were in no way connected. Agitation against the tribute was incessant, and the annual payment became a symbol of British oppression.

There was also British opposition to the tribute. Undersecretary of State for the Colonies Winston Churchill visited Cyprus in 1907 and, in a report on his visit, declared, &quot;We have no right, except by force majeure, to take a penny of the Cyprus Tribute to relieve us from our own obligations, however unfortunately contracted.&quot; Parliament soon voted a permanent annual grant-in-aid of 50,000 pounds sterling to Cyprus and reduced the tribute accordingly.

==Annexation of Cyprus by Britain, 1914, ends Convention==

Following the outbreak of the First World War, the Ottoman Empire decided to join the war on the side of the Central Powers, and on 5 November 1914 the British formally annexed Cyprus as a Crown colony. At the same time, the Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt and the Sudan was declared to be the Sultanate of Egypt, a British protectorate.

<doc id="658074" wikidata="Q2998314" url="?curid=658074" title="Observational cosmology">
<text>Observational cosmology is the study of the structure, the evolution and the origin of the universe through observation, using instruments such as telescopes and cosmic ray detectors.

==Early observations==
The science of physical cosmology as it is practiced today had its subject material defined in the years following the Shapley-Curtis debate when it was determined that the universe had a larger scale than the Milky Way galaxy. This was precipitated by observations that established the size and the dynamics of the cosmos that could be explained by Albert Einstein&#x27;s General Theory of Relativity. In its infancy, cosmology was a speculative science based on a very limited number of observations and characterized by a dispute between steady state theorists and promoters of Big Bang cosmology. It was not until the 1990s and beyond that the astronomical observations would be able to eliminate competing theories and drive the science to the &quot;Golden Age of Cosmology&quot; which was heralded by David Schramm at a National Academy of Sciences colloquium in 1992.

===Hubble&#x27;s law and the cosmic distance ladder===
Distance measurements in astronomy have historically been and continue to be confounded by considerable measurement uncertainty. In particular, while stellar parallax can be used to measure the distance to nearby stars, the observational limits imposed by the difficulty in measuring the minuscule parallaxes associated with objects beyond our galaxy meant that astronomers had to look for alternative ways to measure cosmic distances. To this end, a standard candle measurement for Cepheid variables was discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt in 1908 which would provide Edwin Hubble with the rung on the cosmic distance ladder he would need to determine the distance to spiral nebula. Hubble used the 100-inch Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory to identify individual stars in those galaxies, and determine the distance to the galaxies by isolating individual Cepheids. This firmly established the spiral nebula as being objects well outside the Milky Way galaxy. Determining the distance to &quot;island universes&quot;, as they were dubbed in the popular media, established the scale of the universe and settled the Shapley-Curtis debate once and for all.

In 1927, by combining various measurements, including Hubble&#x27;s distance measurements and Vesto Slipher&#x27;s determinations of redshifts for these objects, Georges Lemaître was the first to estimate a constant of proportionality between galaxies&#x27; distances and what was termed their &quot;recessional velocities&quot;, finding a value of about 600 km/s/Mpc. He showed that this was theoretically expected in a universe model based on general relativity. Two years later, Hubble showed that the relation between the distances and velocities was a positive correlation and had a slope of about 500 km/s/Mpc. This correlation would come to be known as &quot;Hubble&#x27;s law&quot; and would serve as the observational foundation for the expanding universe theories on which cosmology is still based. The publication of the observations by Slipher, Wirtz, Hubble and their colleagues and the acceptance by the theorists of their theoretical implications in light of Einstein&#x27;s General theory of relativity is considered the beginning of the modern science of cosmology.

===Nuclide abundances===

Determination of the cosmic abundance of elements has a history dating back to early spectroscopic measurements of light from astronomical objects and the identification of emission and absorption lines which corresponded to particular electronic transitions in chemical elements identified on Earth. For example, the element Helium was first identified through its spectroscopic signature in the Sun before it was isolated as a gas on Earth.

Computing relative abundances was achieved through corresponding spectroscopic observations to measurements of the elemental composition of meteorites.
===Detection of the cosmic microwave background===
A cosmic microwave background was predicted in 1948 by George Gamow and Ralph Alpher, and by Alpher and Robert Herman as due to the hot Big Bang model. Moreover, Alpher and Herman were able to estimate the temperature, but their results were not widely discussed in the community. Their prediction was rediscovered by Robert Dicke and Yakov Zel&#x27;dovich in the early 1960s with the first published recognition of the CMB radiation as a detectable phenomenon appeared in a brief paper by Soviet astrophysicists A. G. Doroshkevich and Igor Novikov, in the spring of 1964. In 1964, David Todd Wilkinson and Peter Roll, Dicke&#x27;s colleagues at Princeton University, began constructing a Dicke radiometer to measure the cosmic microwave background. In 1965, Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson at the Crawford Hill location of Bell Telephone Laboratories in nearby Holmdel Township, New Jersey had built a Dicke radiometer that they intended to use for radio astronomy and satellite communication experiments. Their instrument had an excess 3.5 K antenna temperature which they could not account for. After receiving a telephone call from Crawford Hill, Dicke famously quipped: &quot;Boys, we&#x27;ve been scooped.&quot; A meeting between the Princeton and Crawford Hill groups determined that the antenna temperature was indeed due to the microwave background. Penzias and Wilson received the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery.

==Modern observations==
Today, observational cosmology continues to test the predictions of theoretical cosmology and has led to the refinement of cosmological models. For example, the observational evidence for dark matter has heavily influenced theoretical modeling of structure and galaxy formation. When trying to calibrate the Hubble diagram with accurate supernova standard candles, observational evidence for dark energy was obtained in the late 1990s. These observations have been incorporated into a six-parameter framework known as the Lambda-CDM model which explains the evolution of the universe in terms of its constituent material. This model has subsequently been verified by detailed observations of the cosmic microwave background, especially through the WMAP experiment.

Included here are the modern observational efforts that have directly influenced cosmology.

===Redshift surveys===

With the advent of automated telescopes and improvements in spectroscopes, a number of collaborations have been made to map the universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the large-scale structure of the universe. The Great Wall, a vast supercluster of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.
The first redshift survey was the CfA Redshift Survey, started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982. More recently, the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey determined the large-scale structure of one section of the Universe, measuring &quot;z&quot;-values for over 220,000 galaxies; data collection was completed in 2002, and the final data set was released 30 June 2003. (In addition to mapping large-scale patterns of galaxies, 2dF established an upper limit on neutrino mass.) Another notable investigation, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), is ongoing and aims to obtain measurements on around 100 million objects. SDSS has recorded redshifts for galaxies as high as 0.4, and has been involved in the detection of quasars beyond &quot;z&quot; = 6. The DEEP2 Redshift Survey uses the Keck telescopes with the new &quot;DEIMOS&quot; spectrograph; a follow-up to the pilot program DEEP1, DEEP2 is designed to measure faint galaxies with redshifts 0.7 and above, and it is therefore planned to provide a complement to SDSS and 2dF.

===Cosmic microwave background experiments===


===Telescope observations===

====Radio====
The brightest sources of low-frequency radio emission (10 MHz and 100 GHz) are radio galaxies which can be observed out to extremely high redshifts. These are subsets of the active galaxies that have extended features known as lobes and jets which extend away from the galactic nucleus distances on the order of megaparsecs. Because radio galaxies are so bright, astronomers have used them to probe extreme distances and early times in the evolution of the universe.

====Infrared====
Far infrared observations including submillimeter astronomy have revealed a number of sources at cosmological distances. With the exception of a few atmospheric windows, most of infrared light is blocked by the atmosphere, so the observations generally take place from balloon or space-based instruments. Current observational experiments in the infrared include NICMOS, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Keck Interferometer, the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy, and the Herschel Space Observatory. The next large space telescope planned by NASA, the James Webb Space Telescope will also explore in the infrared.

An additional infrared survey, the Two-Micron All Sky Survey, has also been very useful in revealing the distribution of galaxies, similar to other optical surveys described below.

====Optical rays (visible to human eyes)====
Optical light is still the primary means by which astronomy occurs, and in the context of cosmology, this means observing distant galaxies and galaxy clusters in order to learn about the large scale structure of the Universe as well as galaxy evolution. Redshift surveys have been a common means by which this has been accomplished with some of the most famous including the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. These optical observations generally use either photometry or spectroscopy to measure the redshift of a galaxy and then, via Hubble&#x27;s law, determine its distance modulo redshift distortions due to peculiar velocities. Additionally, the position of the galaxies as seen on the sky in celestial coordinates can be used to gain information about the other two spatial dimensions.

Very deep observations (which is to say sensitive to dim sources) are also useful tools in cosmology. The Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra Deep Field, Hubble Extreme Deep Field, and Hubble Deep Field South are all examples of this.

==Future observations==

===Cosmic neutrinos===

It is a prediction of the Big Bang model that the universe is filled with a neutrino background radiation, analogous to the cosmic microwave background radiation. The microwave background is a relic from when the universe was about 380,000 years old, but the neutrino background is a relic from when the universe was about two seconds old.

If this neutrino radiation could be observed, it would be a window into very early stages of the universe. Unfortunately, these neutrinos would now be very cold, and so they are effectively impossible to observe directly.

<text>:&quot;This page primarily is meant to list non-video game designers. Please see list of computer and video game industry people for a list of well-known video game designers.&quot;

A game designer is a person who invents games at the conceptual level. Most game designers are &quot;unsung&quot;; for example, no one knows who invented Chess or Hearts.

However, many public figures in game design, include commercial game developers and game-inventing mathematicians.

<text>Venn Spearman Young (16 February 1929 – 14 January 1993) was a New Zealand politician. He was a member of the National Party, and served as a Cabinet Minister in the government of Robert Muldoon. He is known for his failed attempt to legalise &quot;homosexual acts&quot; in 1975.

==Early life==
Young was born in Stratford, Taranaki. He attended primary school in Stratford, but received his high school education in Nelson, at Nelson College from 1942 to 1944. He then returned to Taranaki, becoming a dairy farmer. He gained some distinction as a rugby player, representing Taranaki. He was also active in the Anglican Church.

==Member of Parliament==




In the 1966 election, Young stood as the National Party&#x27;s candidate for the Egmont electorate, and was successful. He was to hold Egmont in the next three elections, gaining a straight majority each time. At the 1978 election, the Egmont electorate was abolished, and Young successfully contested the new Waitotara electorate. He remained the MP for Waitotara until his departure from politics.

===Private members&#x27; Bill===
In mid 1974, Young attracted considerable controversy by putting forward a private members&#x27; bill to legalise private &quot;homosexual acts&quot; between consenting adults. The proposed age of consent was twenty-one, and although this was later reduced to twenty by a select committee, a number of homosexual lobbyists criticised it on this count. By far the most vocal criticism, however, came from conservatives, including many of his National Party colleagues. On 4 July 1975, the bill was defeated, with 34 votes against and 29 votes in favour. There were 24 abstentions.

===Cabinet minister===
Despite having alienated many of his party colleagues, Young entered Cabinet when National won the 1975 election. Robert Muldoon, the new Prime Minister, appointed Young to the Lands, Forests, and Environment portfolios, which he held for two parliamentary terms from December 1975 to 1981. In 1981, Young was moved to the Social Welfare portfolio, which he retained until National&#x27;s defeat in the 1984 election.

In the 1990 New Year Honours, Young was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services.

==Later life, death, and legacy==
In 1986, Young voted against the Homosexual Law Reform Bill (promoted by Labour&#x27;s Fran Wilde), after an amendment he had proposed setting the homosexual age of consent at 20 was rejected.

Young retired from parliament at the 1990 election.

He died in January 1993 following a heart attack, and was buried in Hawera Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and nine children, including Jonathan Young who served as the National MP for the New Plymouth electorate from 2008 to 2020 and Audrey Young, senior political correspondent and former political editor of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;.

<doc id="658084" wikidata="Q166849" url="?curid=658084" title="Magnifying glass">
<text>A magnifying glass is a convex lens that is used to produce a magnified image of an object. The lens is usually mounted in a frame with a handle. A magnifying glass can be used to focus light, such as to concentrate the Sun&#x27;s radiation to create a hot spot at the focus for fire starting.

A sheet magnifier consists of many very narrow concentric ring-shaped lenses, such that the combination acts as a single lens but is much thinner. This arrangement is known as a Fresnel lens.

The magnifying glass is an icon of detective fiction, particularly that of Sherlock Holmes.

==History==
&quot;The evidence indicates that the use of lenses was widespread throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean basin over several millennia&quot;. Archaeological findings from the 1980s in Crete&#x27;s Idaean Cave unearthed rock crystal lenses dating back to the Archaic Greek period, showcasing exceptional optical quality. These discoveries suggest that the use of lenses for magnification and possibly for starting fires was widespread in the Mediterranean and Middle East, indicating an advanced understanding of optics in antiquity. The earliest explicit written evidence of a magnifying device is a joke in Aristophanes&#x27;s &quot;The Clouds&quot; from 424 BC, where magnifying lenses to ignite tinder were sold in a pharmacy, and Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;lens&quot;, a glass globe filled with water, used to cauterize wounds. (Seneca wrote that it could be used to read letters &quot;no matter how small or dim&quot;.) A convex lens used for forming a magnified image was described in the &quot;Book of Optics&quot; by Ibn al-Haytham in 1021. After the book was translated during the Latin translations of the 12th century, Roger Bacon described the properties of a magnifying glass in 13th-century England. This was followed by the development of eyeglasses in 13th-century Italy. In the late 1500s, two Dutch spectacle makers Jacob Metius and Zacharias Janssen crafted the compound microscope by assembling several magnifying lenses in a tube. Hans Lipperhey introduced the telescope in 1608 and Galileo Galilei improved on the device in 1609.

==Magnification==
The magnification of a magnifying glass depends upon where it is placed between the user&#x27;s eye and the object being viewed, and the total distance between them. The &quot;magnifying power&quot; is equivalent to angular magnification (this should not be confused with optical power, which is a different quantity). The magnifying power is the ratio of the sizes of the images formed on the user&#x27;s retina with and without the lens. For the &quot;without&quot; case, it is typically assumed that the user would bring the object as close to one eye as possible without it becoming blurry. This point, known as the &quot;near point of accommodation&quot;, varies with age. In a young child, it can be as close as 5 cm, while, in an elderly person it may be as far as one or two metres. Magnifiers are typically characterized using a &quot;standard&quot; value of 0.25 m.

The highest magnifying power is obtained by putting the lens very close to one eye, and moving the eye and the lens together to obtain the best focus. The object will then typically also be close to the lens. The magnifying power obtained in this condition is , where is the optical power in dioptres and is the near point of the eye, which is typically assumed to be 0.25 m. This value of the magnifying power is the one normally used to characterize magnifiers. It is typically denoted &quot;, where . This is sometimes called the &quot;total power&quot; of the magnifier (not to be confused with optical power).

Magnifiers are not always used as described above because it is more comfortable to put the magnifier close to the object (one focal length away). The eye can then be a larger distance away, and a good image can be obtained very easily; the focus is not very sensitive to the eye&#x27;s exact position. The magnifying power in this case is roughly .

A typical magnifying glass might have a focal length of 25 cm, corresponding to an optical power of 4 dioptres. Such a magnifier would be sold as a &quot;2×&quot; magnifier. In actual use, an observer with &quot;typical&quot; eyes would obtain a magnifying power between 1 and 2, depending on where lens is held. The dependence on the value of near point means that an older person obtains more magnification from a magnifying glass than a young person does.

==Alternatives==
Magnifying glasses typically have low magnifying power: 2×–6×, with the lower-power types being much more common. At higher magnifications, the image quality of a simple magnifying glass becomes poor due to optical aberrations, particularly spherical aberration. When more magnification or a better image is required, other types of hand magnifier are typically used. A Coddington magnifier provides higher magnification with improved image quality. Even better images can be obtained with a multiple-lens magnifier, such as a Hastings triplet. High power magnifiers are sometimes mounted in a cylindrical or conical holder with no handle, often designed to be worn on the head; this is called a loupe.

Such magnifiers can reach up to about 30×, and at these magnifications the aperture of the magnifier becomes very small and it must be placed very close to both the object and the eye. For more convenient use or for magnification beyond about 30×, a microscope is necessary.

Fresnel lenses are used as magnifiers, for example for reading printed text.

== Use as a symbol ==
The magnifying glass (, or U+1F50D in Unicode: 🔍) is commonly used as a symbolic representation for the ability to search or zoom, especially in computer software and websites. U+1F50E is a right-pointing version: 🔎.

<text>Newtown St Boswells (; ) is a village in the Scottish Borders council area, in south-east Scotland. The village lies south of the Eildon Hills on the Sprouston and Newtown burns, approximately south-east of Edinburgh. It is the administrative centre of the Scottish Borders, and was historically in the county of Roxburghshire.

==History==
Newtown St Boswells is an old settlement, well-established by the 16th century. The town has been known at various times as Newtoune, Newtown of Eildon, Neuton and Newtown of Dryburgh. It lies split between the civil parishes of Melrose and St Boswells.

Historically, Newtown St Boswells was a centre for milling grain, with watermills on its burns. It became a regional centre of communication and an exporter of livestock after the opening of its railway station. This importance has declined since the closure of the station in 1969.
Roxburghshire County Council established offices at Newtown St Boswells in 1896, and subsequently moved its meeting place there from Jedburgh in 1930. A large new building was added to the site in 1968. From 1975 to 1996, the offices served as the administrative centre for Borders Regional Council. Since the 1996 the offices have been the headquarters of Scottish Borders Council and known as the Council Headquarters.

==Education==
The village is served by Newtown Primary School, which is a feeder school to Earlston High School, about away in Earlston. The primary school also has nursery provision for preschool-aged children. A Borders College campus at the southeastern tip of the village specialises in agricultural education.

<doc id="658095" wikidata="Q15856" url="?curid=658095" title="Olm">
<text>The olm () or proteus (Proteus anguinus) is an aquatic salamander which is the only species in the genus Proteus of the family Proteidae and the only exclusively cave-dwelling chordate species found in Europe; the family&#x27;s other extant genus is &quot;Necturus&quot;. In contrast to most amphibians, it is entirely aquatic, eating, sleeping, and breeding underwater. Living in caves found in the Dinaric Alps, it is endemic to the waters that flow underground through the extensive limestone bedrock of the karst of Central and Southeastern Europe in the basin of the Soča River () near Trieste, Italy, southern Slovenia, southwestern Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Introduced populations are found near Vicenza, Italy, and Kranj, Slovenia. It was first mentioned in 1689 by the local naturalist Valvasor in his &quot;Glory of the Duchy of Carniola&quot;, who reported that, after heavy rains, the olms were washed up from the underground waters and were believed by local people to be a cave dragon&#x27;s offspring.

This cave salamander is most notable for its adaptations to a life of complete darkness in its underground habitat. The olm&#x27;s eyes are undeveloped, leaving it blind, while its other senses, particularly those of smell and hearing, are acutely developed. Most populations also lack any pigmentation in their skin. The olm has three toes on its forelimbs, but only two toes on its hind feet. It exhibits neoteny, retaining larval characteristics like external gills into adulthood, like some American amphibians, the axolotl and the mudpuppies (&quot;Necturus&quot;).

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;olm&quot; is a German loanword that was incorporated into English in the late 19th century. The origin of the German or &#x27;cave olm&#x27;, is unclear. It may be a variant of the word &#x27;salamander&#x27;.

=== Common names ===
It is also called the &quot;human fish&quot; by locals because of its fleshy skin color (translated literally from , , , , ), as well as &quot;cave salamander&quot; or &quot;white salamander&quot;. In Slovenia, it is called &quot;močeril&quot; (from *&quot;močerъ&quot; &#x27;earthworm, damp creepy-crawly&#x27;; &quot;moča&quot; &#x27;dampness&#x27;).

== Description ==
===External appearance===

The olm&#x27;s body is snakelike, long, with some specimens reaching up to , which makes them some of the largest cave-dwelling animals in the world. The average length is between 23 and 25 cm. Females grow larger than males, but otherwise the primary external difference between the sexes is in the cloaca region (shape and size) when breeding. The trunk is cylindrical, uniformly thick, and segmented with regularly spaced furrows at the myomere borders. The tail is relatively short, laterally flattened, and surrounded by a thin fin. The limbs are small and thin, with a reduced number of digits compared to other amphibians: the front legs have three digits instead of the normal four, and the rear have two digits instead of five. Its body is covered by a thin layer of skin, which contains very little of the pigment riboflavin, making it yellowish-white or pink in color.

The white skin color of the olm retains the ability to produce melanin, and will gradually turn dark when exposed to light; in some cases the larvae are also colored. One population, the black olm, is always pigmented and dark brownish to blackish when adult. The olm&#x27;s pear-shaped head ends with a short, dorsoventrally flattened snout. The mouth opening is small, with tiny teeth forming a sieve to keep larger particles inside the mouth. The nostrils are so small as to be imperceptible, but are placed somewhat laterally near the end of the snout. The regressed eyes are covered by a layer of skin. The olm breathes with external gills that form two branched tufts at the back of the head. They are red in color because the oxygen-rich blood shows through the non-pigmented skin. The olm also has rudimentary lungs, but their role in respiration is only accessory, except during hypoxic conditions.

===Sensory organs===
Cave-dwelling animals have been prompted, among other adaptations, to develop and improve non-visual sensory systems in order to orient in and adapt to permanently dark habitats. The olm&#x27;s sensory system is also adapted to life in the subterranean aquatic environment. Unable to use vision for orientation, the olm compensates with other senses, which are better developed than in amphibians living on the surface. It retains larval proportions, like a long, slender body and a large, flattened head, and is thus able to carry a larger number of sensory receptors.

====Photoreceptors====
Although blind, the olm swims away from light. The eyes are regressed, but retain sensitivity. They lie deep below the dermis of the skin and are rarely visible except in some younger adults. Larvae have normal eyes, but development soon stops and they start regressing, finally atrophying after four months of development. The pineal body also has photoreceptive cells which, though regressed, retain visual pigment like the photoreceptive cells of the regressed eye. The pineal gland in &quot;Proteus&quot; probably possesses some control over the physiological processes. Behavioral experiments revealed that the skin itself is also sensitive to light. Photosensitivity of the integument is due to the pigment melanopsin inside specialized cells called melanophores. Preliminary immunocytochemical analyses support the existence of photosensitive pigment also in the animal&#x27;s integument.

====Chemoreceptors====
The olm is capable of sensing very low concentrations of organic compounds in the water. They are better at sensing both the quantity and quality of prey by smell than related amphibians. The nasal epithelium, located on the inner surface of the nasal cavity and in the Jacobson&#x27;s organ, is thicker than in other amphibians. The taste buds are in the mucous epithelium of the mouth, most of them on the upper side of the tongue and on the entrance to the gill cavities. Those in the oral cavity are used for tasting food, where those near the gills probably sense chemicals in the surrounding water.

====Mechano- and electroreceptors====
The sensory epithelia of the inner ear are very specifically differentiated, enabling the olm to receive sound waves in the water, as well as vibrations from the ground. The complex functional-morphological orientation of the sensory cells enables the animal to register the sound sources. As this animal stays neotenic throughout its long life span, it is only occasionally exposed to normal adult hearing in air, which is probably also possible for &quot;Proteus&quot; as in most salamanders. Hence, it would be of adaptive value in caves, with no vision available, to profit from underwater hearing by recognizing particular sounds and eventual localization of prey or other sound sources, i.e. acoustical orientation in general.
Behavioural (ethological) tests have shown that its sensitivity for detecting underwater sound waves reaches into the area of frequencies of sound waves between 10 and more than 12,000 Hz, while the greatest sensitivity is reached between 1,500 and 2,000 Hz. The ethological experiments indicate that the best hearing sensitivity of &quot;Proteus&quot; is between 10 Hz and up to 12,000 Hz. The lateral line supplements inner ear sensitivity by registering low-frequency nearby water displacements.

A new type of electroreception sensory organ has been analyzed on the head of &quot;Proteus&quot;, utilizing light and electron microscopy. These new organs have been described as ampullary organs.

Like some other lower vertebrates, the olm has the ability to register weak electric fields. Some behavioral experiments suggest that the olm may be able to use Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to orient itself. In 2002, &quot;Proteus&quot; &quot;anguinus&quot; was found to align itself with natural and artificially modified magnetic fields.

==Ecology and life history==
The olm lives in well-oxygenated underground waters with a typical, very stable temperature of , infrequently as warm as . There have also been observations in northeastern Italy where they swim to the surface in springs outside the caves, even in daylight, where they occasionally feed on earthworms. The black olm may occur in surface waters that are somewhat warmer.

The olm swims by eel-like twisting of its body, assisted only slightly by its poorly developed legs. It is a predatory animal, feeding on small crustaceans (for example, &quot;Troglocaris&quot; shrimp, &quot;Niphargus&quot;, &quot;Asellus&quot;, and &quot;Synurella&quot; amphipods, and &quot;Oniscus asellus&quot;), snails (for example, &quot;Belgrandiella&quot;), and occasionally insects and insect larvae (for example, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Diptera). It does not chew its food, instead swallowing it whole. The olm is resistant to long-term starvation, an adaptation to its underground habitat. It can consume large amounts of food at once, and store nutrients as large deposits of lipids and glycogen in the liver. When food is scarce, it reduces its activity and metabolic rate, and can also reabsorb its own tissues in severe cases. Controlled experiments have shown that an olm can survive up to 10 years without food.

Olms are gregarious, and usually aggregate either under stones or in fissures. Sexually active males are an exception, establishing and defending territories where they attract females. The scarcity of food makes fighting energetically costly, so encounters between males usually only involve display. This is a behavioral adaptation to life underground.

===Breeding and longevity===
Reproduction has only been observed in captivity so far. Sexually mature males have swollen cloacas, brighter skin color, two lines at the side of the tail, and slightly curled fins. No such changes have been observed in the females. The male can start courtship even without the presence of a female. He chases other males away from the chosen area, and may then secrete a female-attracting pheromone. When the female approaches, he starts to circle around her and fan her with his tail. Then he starts to touch the female&#x27;s body with his snout, and the female touches his cloaca with her snout. At that point, he starts to move forward with a twitching motion, and the female follows. He then deposits the spermatophore, and the animals keep moving forward until the female hits it with her cloaca, after which she stops and stands still. The spermatophore sticks to her and the sperm cells swim inside her cloaca, where they attempt to fertilize her eggs. The courtship ritual can be repeated several times over a couple of hours.

The female lays up to 70 eggs, each about in diameter, and places them between rocks, where they remain under her protection. The average is 35 eggs and the adult female typically breeds every 12.5 years. The tadpoles are long when they hatch and live on yolk stored in the cells of the digestive tract for a month.

At a temperature of , the olm&#x27;s embryonic development (time in the eggs before hatching) is 140 days, but it is somewhat slower in colder water and faster in warmer, being as little as 86 days at . After hatching, it takes another 14 years to reach sexual maturity if living in water that is . The larvae gain adult appearance after nearly four months, with the duration of development strongly correlating with water temperature. Unconfirmed historical observations of viviparity exist, but it has been shown that the females possess a gland that produces the egg casing, similar to those of fish and egg-laying amphibians. Paul Kammerer reported that female olm gave birth to live young in water at or below and laid eggs at higher, but rigorous observations have not confirmed that. The olm appears to be exclusively oviparous.

Development of the olm and other troglobite amphibians is characterized by heterochrony – the animal does not undergo metamorphosis and instead retains larval features. The form of heterochrony in the olm is neoteny – delayed somatic maturity with precocious reproductive maturity, i.e. reproductive maturity is reached while retaining the larval external morphology. In other amphibians, the metamorphosis is regulated by the hormone thyroxine, secreted by the thyroid gland. The thyroid is normally developed and functioning in the olm, so the lack of metamorphosis is due to the unresponsiveness of key tissues to thyroxine.

Longevity is estimated at up to 58 years. A study published in &quot;Biology Letters&quot; estimated that they have a maximum lifespan of over 100 years and that the lifespan of an average adult is around 68.5 years. When compared to the longevity and body mass of other amphibians, olms are outliers, living longer than would be predicted from their size.

==Taxonomic history==
Olms from different cave systems differ substantially in body measurements, color, and some microscopic characteristics. Earlier researchers used these differences to support the division into five species, while modern herpetologists understand that external morphology is not reliable for amphibian systematics and can be extremely variable, depending on nourishment, illness, and other factors; even varying among individuals in a single population. &quot;Proteus anguinus&quot; is now considered a single species. The length of the head is the most obvious difference between the various populations – individuals from Stična, Slovenia, have shorter heads on average than those from Tržič, Slovenia, and the Istrian peninsula, for example.

===Black olm===
The black olm (Proteus anguinus parkelj ) is the only recognized subspecies of the olm other than the nominate subspecies. It is endemic to the underground waters near Črnomelj, Slovenia, an area smaller than . It was first found in 1986 by members of the Slovenian Karst Research Institute, who were exploring the water from Dobličica karst spring in the White Carniola region.

It has several features separating it from the nominotypical subspecies (&quot;Proteus a. anguinus&quot;):
=== &quot;Proteus bavaricus&quot; ===
A potential species, &quot;Proteus bavaricus&quot;, is speculated to be closely related to &quot;P. anguinus&quot;. The species was described from a single bone by George Brunner, and the holotype is housed in his private collection. It was found in Bavaria&#x27;s Devil&#x27;s Cave, in the Pleistocene layer. In his 1998 book, J. Alan Hollman described the species as a &quot;problematic&quot; taxon, saying that Brunner&#x27;s drawing of the bone does not adequately show the differences between &quot;P. bavaricus&quot; and &quot;P. anguinus&quot;.

==Research history==
The first written mention of the olm is in Johann Weikhard von Valvasor&#x27;s &quot;The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola&quot; (1689) as a baby dragon. Heavy rains of Slovenia would wash the olms up from their subterranean habitat, giving rise to the folklore belief that great dragons lived beneath the Earth&#x27;s crust, and the olms were the undeveloped offspring of these mythical beasts. In his book Valvasor compiled the local Slovenian folk stories and pieced together the rich mythology of the creature and documented observations of the olm as &quot;Barely a span long, akin to a lizard, in short, a worm and vermin of which there are many hereabouts&quot;.

The first researcher to retrieve a live olm was a physician and researcher from Idrija, Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, who sent dead specimens and drawings to colleagues and collectors. Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti, though, was the first to briefly describe the olm in 1768 and give it the scientific name &quot;Proteus anguinus&quot;. It was not until the end of the century that Carl Franz Anton Ritter von Schreibers from the Naturhistorisches Museum of Vienna started to look into this animal&#x27;s anatomy. The specimens were sent to him by Sigmund Zois. Schreibers presented his findings in 1801 to The Royal Society in London, and later also in Paris. Soon, the olm started to gain wide recognition and attract significant attention, resulting in thousands of animals being sent to researchers and collectors worldwide. A Dr Edwards was quoted in a book of 1839 as believing that &quot;...the Proteus Anguinis is the first stage of an animal prevented from growing to perfection by inhabiting the subterraneous waters of Carniola.&quot;

In 1880 Marie von Chauvin began the first long-term study of olms in captivity. She learned that they detected prey&#x27;s motion, panicked when a heavy object was dropped near their habitat, and developed color if exposed to weak light for a few hours a day, but could not cause them to change to a land-dwelling adult form, as she and others had done with axolotl.

The basis of functional morphological investigations in Slovenia was set up by in the 1980s. More than twenty years later, the Research Group for functional morphological Studies of the Vertebrates in the Department of Biology (Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana), is one of the leading groups studying the olm under the guidance of Boris Bulog. There are also several cave laboratories in Europe in which olms have been introduced and are being studied. These are Moulis, Ariège (France), Choranche cave (France), Han-sur-Lesse (Belgium), and Aggtelek (Hungary). They were also introduced into the Hermannshöhle (Germany) and Oliero (Italy) caves, where they still live today. Additionally, there is evidence that a small number of olms were introduced to the United Kingdom in the 1940s, although it&#x27;s highly likely that the animals perished shortly after being released.

The olm was used by Charles Darwin in his seminal work &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; as an example for the reduction of structures through disuse:

An olm (Proteus) genome project is currently underway by the University of Ljubljana and BGI. With an estimated genome size roughly 15-times the size of human genome, this will likely be the largest animal genome sequenced so far.

==Conservation==
The olm is extremely vulnerable to changes in its environment, due to its adaptation to the specific conditions in caves. Water resources in the karst are extremely sensitive to all kinds of pollution. The contamination of the karst underground waters is due to the large number of waste disposal sites leached by rainwater, as well as to the accidental overflow of various liquids. The reflection of such pollution in the karst underground waters depends on the type and quantity of pollutants, and on the rock structure through which the waters penetrate. Self-purification processes in the underground waters are not completely understood, but they are quite different from those in surface waters.

Among the most serious chemical pollutants are chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides, fertilizers, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are or were used in a variety of industrial processes and in the manufacture of many kinds of materials; and metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic. All of these substances persist in the environment, being slowly, if at all, degraded by natural processes. In addition, all are toxic to life if they accumulate in any appreciable quantity. The olm is nevertheless noted for its capability of surviving higher concentrations of accumulated PCBs than related aquatic organisms.

The olm was included in annexes II and IV of the 1992 EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). The list of species in annex II, combined with the habitats listed in annex I, is used by individual countries to designate protected areas known as &#x27;Special Areas of Conservation&#x27;. These areas, combined with others created by the older Birds Directive were to form the Natura 2000 network. Annex IV additionally lists &quot;animal and plant species of community interest in need of strict protection&quot;, although this has little legal ramifications. Areas inhabited by the olm were eventually included in the Slovenian, Italian and Croatian parts of the Natura 2000 network.

The olm was first protected in Slovenia in 1922 along with all cave fauna, but the protection was not effective and a substantial black market came into existence. In 1982 it was placed on a list of rare and endangered species. This list also had the effect of prohibiting trade of the species. After joining the European Union in 2004, Slovenia had to establish mechanisms for protection of the species included in the EU Habitats Directive. The olm is included in a &quot;Slovenian Red list&quot; of endangered species, thus its capturing or killing is allowed only under specific circumstances determined by the local authorities (e.g. scientific study).

In Croatia, the olm is protected by the legislation designed to protect amphibians – collecting is possible only for research purposes by permission of the National Administration for Nature and Environment Protection. As of 2020 the Croatian population has been assessed as &#x27;critically endangered&#x27; in Croatia. As of 1999, the environmental laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro had not yet been clarified for this species.

In the 1980s the IUCN claimed that some illegal collection of this species for the pet trade took place, but that the extent of this was unknown: this text has been copied into subsequent assessments, but by now the anecdotic claims are not considered to be indicative of a major threat. Since the 1980s until the most recent assessment in 2022 the organisation has rated the conservation status for the IUCN Red List as &#x27;vulnerable&#x27;, this because of its natural distribution being fragmented over a number of cave systems as opposed to being continuous, and what they consider a decline in extent and quality of its habitat, which they assume means that the population has been decreasing for the last 40 years.

Zagreb Zoo in Croatia houses the olm. Historically, olms were kept in several zoos in Germany, as well as in Belgium, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United Kingdom. At present they can only be experienced at Zagreb Zoo, &quot;Hermannshöhle&quot; in Germany and Vivarium Proteus (Proteus Vivarium) within &quot;Postojnska jama&quot; (Postojna Cave) in Slovenia. There are also captive breeding programs in places like France.

==Cultural significance==
The olm is a symbol of Slovenian natural heritage. The enthusiasm of scientists and the broader public about this inhabitant of Slovenian caves is still strong 300 years after its discovery. Postojna Cave is one of the birthplaces of biospeleology due to the olm and other rare cave inhabitants, such as the blind cave beetle. The image of the olm contributes significantly to the fame of Postojna Cave, which Slovenia successfully utilizes for the promotion of ecotourism in Postojna and other parts of Slovenian karst. Tours of Postojna Cave also include a tour around the speleobiological station – the Proteus vivarium, showing different aspects of the cave environment.

The olm was also depicted on one of the Slovenian tolar coins. It was also the namesake of &quot;Proteus&quot;, the oldest Slovenian popular science magazine, first published in 1933.

<doc id="658099" wikidata="Q156141" url="?curid=658099" title="Plumbaginaceae">
<text>Plumbaginaceae is a family of flowering plants, with a cosmopolitan distribution. The family is sometimes referred to as the leadwort family or the plumbago family.

Most species in this family are perennial herbaceous plants, but a few grow as lianas or shrubs. The plants have perfect flowers and are pollinated by insects. They are found in many different climatic regions, from arctic to tropical conditions, but are particularly associated with salt-rich steppes, marshes, and sea coasts.

The family has been recognized by most taxonomists. The APG II system (2003; unchanged from the APG system of 1998), recognizes this family and assigns it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots. It includes 30 genera and about 725 species.

The 1981 Cronquist system placed the family in a separate order Plumbaginales, which included no other families. The Dahlgren system had segregated some of these plants as family Limoniaceae.

<text>The vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), or simply vervet, is an Old World monkey of the family Cercopithecidae native to Africa. The term &quot;vervet&quot; is also used to refer to all the members of the genus &quot;Chlorocebus&quot;. The five distinct subspecies can be found mostly throughout Southern Africa, as well as some of the eastern countries. These mostly herbivorous monkeys have black faces and grey body hair color, ranging in body length from about for females, to about for males.

In addition to behavioral research on natural populations, vervet monkeys serve as a nonhuman primate model for understanding genetic and social behaviors of humans. They have been noted for having human-like characteristics, such as hypertension, anxiety, and social and dependent alcohol use. Vervets live in social groups ranging from 10 to 70 individuals, with males moving to other groups at the time of sexual maturity. Studies done on vervet monkeys involve their communication and alarm calls, specifically in regard to kin and group recognition, and particular predator sightings.

== Taxonomy ==

The vervet monkey was previously classified as &quot;Cercopithecus aethiops&quot;, now renamed &#x27;grivet&#x27;, and reclassified as &quot;Chlorocebus&quot;. The vervet and malbrouck have also been considered conspecific, or as subspecies of a widespread &quot;Ch. aethiops&quot;. The different taxa are distinguished by coat colour and other morphological characteristics. The characteristics of &quot;Ch. aethiops&quot; graduate into &quot;Ch. pygerythrus&quot; where their ranges meet, and thus deciding if the vervets commonly known to occur in Kenya are actually &quot;Ch. aethiops&quot; is difficult; animals in the same pack may be classified as one species or the other, and &quot;Ch. pygerythrus&quot; may also interbreed with &quot;Ch. tantalus&quot; where their ranges meet.

Colin Groves recognised the below five subspecies of vervet monkey in the third edition of &quot;Mammals of the World&quot;:

* &quot;Chlorocebus pygerythrus excubitor&quot;
* &quot;Ch. p. hilgerti&quot; from southern Kenya
* &quot;Ch. p. nesiotes&quot;
* &quot;Ch. p. pygerythrus&quot; from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, and Eswatini.
* &quot;Ch. p. rufoviridis&quot; from Mozambique and Uganda has a distinctly reddish-coloured back, which is darker towards the base of the tail.

Groves used &quot;Ch. p. hilgerti&quot; for all East African vervets except the insular subspecies &quot;Ch. p. excubitor&quot; and &quot;Ch. p. nesiotes&quot;. The name &quot;Ch. p. centralis&quot; has been suggested to have precedence, and that &quot;Ch. p. hilgerti&quot; should be restricted to the population of southern Ethiopia.

=== Synonymy ===
&quot;Ch. p. pygerythrus&quot;, as &quot;Cercopithecus aethiops&quot;, was also formerly divided into four subspecies:

*&quot;C. a. pygerythrus&quot;, from South Africa (Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and southern KwaZulu-Natal), and Lesotho; is said to have pale-colored limbs and white hands and feet (though the hands are also said to be black with a scattering of greyish hairs), and a greyish body colour with an olive sheen.
*&quot;C. a. cloetei&quot;, from northern KwaZulu-Natal, Eswatini, and northern South Africa; is darker, with greyish-brown speckles and dark feet.
*&quot;C. a. marjoriae&quot;, from southern Botswana and the North West Province of South Africa; is pale in colour (light ash-grey).
*&quot;C. a. ngamiensis&quot;, from north-eastern Botswana and the Okavango; has pale feet and a yellowish back and the tail is darker (especially towards the tip) than in other southern vervets.

These subspecies are no longer recognised and are synonymous with &quot;Ch. p. pygerythrus&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==

=== Natural habitat ===
The vervet monkey ranges throughout much of Southern and East Africa, being found from Ethiopia and extreme southern South Sudan all the way down to South Africa. It is not found west of the East African Rift or the Luangwa River, where it is replaced by the closely related malbrouck (&quot;C. cynosuros&quot;) species. The vervet monkey inhabits savanna, riverine woodland, coastal forest, and mountains up to 4000 m (13,100 ft). They are adaptable and able to persist in secondary and/or highly fragmented vegetation, including cultivated areas, and sometimes are found living in both rural and urban environments. Annual home range size has been observed to be as high as 176 ha, with an average population density of 54.68 animals/km2.

=== Introduced ===
Vervet monkeys that are naturalised (introduced by humans) are found in Cape Verde, Ascension Island, Saint Helena, St Kitts and Nevis, and Barbados. Dania Beach, Florida, is home to about 40 introduced vervets.

== Physical description ==
The vervet monkey very much resembles a gray langur, having a black face with a white fringe of hair, while its overall hair color is mostly grizzled-grey. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism; the males are larger in weight and body length and may be recognized by a turquoise-blue scrotum. Adult males weigh between , averaging , and have a body length between , averaging from the top of the head to the base of the tail. Adult females weigh between and average , and measure between , averaging .

== Behaviour ==

===Social behaviour===
When males reach sexual maturity, they move to a neighboring group. Often, males move with a brother or peer, presumably for protection against aggression by males and females of the resident group. Groups that had previously transferred males show significantly less aggression upon the arrival of another male. In almost every case, males migrate to adjacent groups. This obviously increases benefits in regard to distance traveled, but also reduces the amount of genetic variance, increasing the likelihood of inbreeding.

Females remain in their groups throughout life. Separate dominance hierarchies are found for each sex. Male hierarchies are determined by age, tenure in the group, fighting abilities, and allies, while female hierarchies are dependent on maternal social status. A large proportion of interactions occurs between individuals that are similarly ranked and closely related. Between unrelated individuals, female competition exists for grooming members of high-ranking families, presumably to gain more access to resources. These observations suggest individual recognition is possible and enables discrimination of genetic relatedness and social status. Interactions between different groups are variable, ranging from highly aggressive to friendly. Furthermore, individuals seem to be able to recognise cross-group vocalisations, and identify from and to which monkey each call is intended, even if the call is made by a subadult male, which is likely to transfer groups. This suggests the members within a group are actively monitoring the activity of other groups, including the movement of individuals within a group.

Within groups, aggression is directed primarily at individuals that are lower on the hierarchy. Once an individual is three years or older, it is considerably more likely to be involved in conflict. Conflict often arises when one group member shows aggression toward a close relative of another. Further, both males and females may redirect aggression towards individuals in which both had close relatives that were previously involved in a conflict. This suggests complex recognition not only of individuals, but also of associations between individuals. This does not suggest recognition of other&#x27;s individual kinship bonds is possible, but rather that discrimination of social relationships does occur.
=== Alarm calls and offspring recognition ===
Vervet monkeys have four confirmed predators: leopards, eagles, pythons, and baboons. The sighting of each predator elicits an acoustically distinct alarm call. As infants, vervets learn to make the variety of calls from observation alone, without explicit tutelage. In experimentation with unreliable signalers, individuals became habituated to incorrect calls from a specific individual. Though the response was lessened for a specific predator, if an unreliable individual gives an alarm call for a different predator, group members respond as if the alarm caller is, in fact, reliable. This suggests vervet monkeys are able to recognize and to respond to not only the individual calling, but also to the semantics of what the individual is communicating. Vervet monkeys are thought to have up to 30 different alarm calls. In the wild, they have been seen giving a different call when seeing a human being approaching, leading researchers to believe that vervet monkeys may have a way of distinguishing between different land and flight predators.

Mothers can recognise their offspring by a scream alone. A juvenile scream elicits a reaction from all mothers, yet the juvenile&#x27;s own mother has a shorter latency in looking in the direction of the scream, as well as an increased duration in her look. Further, mothers have been observed to help their offspring in conflict, yet rarely aid other juveniles. Other mothers evidently can determine to which mother the offspring belongs. Individuals have been observed to look towards the mother whose offspring is creating the scream.

=== Kin relationships ===
Siblings likely provide the prevailing social relationships during development. Within social groups, mother-offspring and sibling interactive units are distinct groups. The sibling interactions are heavily supportive and friendly, but do have some competition. Contests primarily involve postweaning resource allocation by the common mother. For example, siblings have conflict over grooming time allocated by their mother. Offspring are usually not born in extremely close time proximity due to the interbirth period of the mother. This time can be reduced by use of an allomother. The clarity of the familial and sibships within a group may act as a form of alliance, which would come at relatively low cost in regards to grooming. Other alliances are shown through conflict with aggressive individuals that have acted against a closely related sibling.
Allomothering is the process when another individual besides the mother cares for an infant. In groups of vervet monkeys, infants are the target of a tremendous amount of attention. Days after an infant is born, every member of the group inspects the infant at least once by touching or sniffing. While all group members participate in infant caretaking, juvenile females that cannot yet menstruate are responsible for the majority of allomothering. The benefit is mutual for the mother and allomother. Mothers that use allomothers are able to shorten their interbirth periods, the time between successive births. At the same time, allomothers gain experience in rearing infants, and had more success in raising their own offspring. Juvenile females discriminate in preference for the infant they choose to allomother, and usually choose siblings or infants of high-ranking individuals. When a mother allows her juvenile daughter to become an allomother for a newborn sibling, the mother decreases her own investment in the infant, while increasing the chances of successful rearing of her immature daughter.

Grandmothers and grandchildren share one-quarter of their genes, so they should be more likely to form affiliative relationships than unrelated members in a group. Not only do infants approach their grandmothers more often than unrelated members, but they also prefer their grandmothers compared to other adult female kin, not including their own mothers. Additional research has shown grandmothers show no preference over the sex of their grandchild. Interest in the grandchild spurred from the rank of the grandmother within a group. Higher-ranking grandmothers showed more interest in caring for their grandchildren when compared to low-ranking grandmothers. The presence of grandmothers has been associated with a decrease in mortality of infants.

=== Spite ===

Spiteful actions are extremely rare in the animal kingdom. Often, an indirect benefit is gained by the individual acting &#x27;spitefully&#x27;, or by a close relative of that individual. Vervet monkeys have been observed to destroy a competitor&#x27;s food source rather than consume or steal it themselves. While energy is being lost on destroying the food, an advantage is obtained by the individual due to an increase in competitive gain. This would be pertinent for a male that could be displaced within his group by immigrating males.

=== Reproduction ===
Female vervets do not have external signs indicating estrus, thus elaborate social behaviors involving reproduction do not occur. Typically, a female gives birth once a year, between September and February, after a gestation period around 165 days. Usually, only one infant is born at a time, though twins can occur rarely. A normal infant weighs .

== Ecology ==

=== Diet ===
The vervet monkey eats a primarily herbivorous diet, living mostly on wild fruits, flowers, leaves, seeds, and seed pods. In agricultural areas, vervets become problem animals, as they raid bean, pea, young tobacco, vegetable, fruit, and grain crops. Animal foods of their diet include grasshoppers and termites. Raids of cattle egrets and weaver bird nests have been observed where the vervets eat the eggs and chicks.

A list of some natural food plants and part of the plant eaten, in South Africa:

* &quot;Acacia erioloba&quot; – seeds and pods
* &quot;Aloe&quot;spp. – nectar (flowers)
* &quot;Celtis africana&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Colophospermum mopane&quot; – seeds
* &quot;Deinbollia oblongifolia&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Euphorbia ingens&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Euphorbia tirucalli&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Ficus abutilifolia&quot; – figs
* &quot;Ficus sur&quot; – figs
* &quot;Ficus sycomorus&quot; – figs
* &quot;Grewia afra&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Harpephyllum afrum&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Hyphaene coriacea&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Phoenix reclinata&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Protorhus longifolia&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Rhus chirindensis&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Sclerocarya birrea&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Strelitzia nicolai&quot; – soft parts of the flowers
* &quot;Ximenia afra&quot; – fruit
* &quot;Ziziphus mucronata&quot; – fruit
=== Relationship with humans ===
The monkeys are used for biomedical research. Many people living in close proximity to vervet colonies see them as pests, as they steal their food. Heavy fines in some areas discourage the killing of vervet monkeys.

Its status according to the IUCN is &quot;least concern&quot;.

This species was known in ancient Egypt, including the Red Sea Mountains and the Nile Valley. From fresco artworks found in Akrotiri on the Mediterranean island of Santorini there is evidence that the vervet monkey was known to the inhabitants of this settlement around 2000 BC; this fact is most noted for evidence of early contact between Egypt and Akrotiri. Excavations dated to the end of the 1st century AD from Berenike, a Roman-Egyptian port-town on the Red Sea coast, demonstrate that vervet monkeys must have been kept as pets at that time.

<text>Heather Mallick (born 1959) is a Canadian columnist, author and lecturer. She has been a staff columnist for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; since 2010, writing a news column on Saturday and on the opinion page on Monday and Wednesday. She writes about feminism, news and politics. She has previously written for the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, and the &quot;Financial Post&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Mallick was born in Norway House, Manitoba, to an Indian Bengali father from Kolkata and a Scottish mother. She was raised in the Northern Ontario town of Kapuskasing, and in other remote communities where her father worked as a physician. During her childhood, she very much enjoyed reading. At the age of nine she had finished &quot;Cancer Ward&quot; by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and when she turned 11 she read &quot;Lucy Crown&quot; by Irwin Shaw. Mallick attended the University of Toronto where she received a bachelor&#x27;s and Master of Arts degrees in English Literature. She also earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Journalism from Ryerson University after attending Seymour Hersh&#x27;s lecture about Vietnam War&#x27;s My Lai Massacre and studying there for two years. While studying, she worked for the local student newspaper, &quot;The Ryersonian&quot; and during her late university years worked as a summer intern in coveted reporting for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. Mallick is an atheist.

==Career==
After graduation, she got another summer internship at the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, while maintaining a freelance reporter position at &quot;The Globe&quot;. In 1988, she was employed at the Canadian financial daily newspaper &quot;Financial Post&quot; where she first worked as a copy editor and later became a news editor. She left &quot;Financial Post&quot; in 1991, after marrying Stephen Petherbridge, a senior British/Canadian journalist.

She first came to public notice in Canada during the 1990s as the book review editor and writer for the Sunday edition of the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, where she won two Canadian Newspaper Association National Newspaper Awards for critical writing in 1994 and feature writing in 1996. Mallick had quit the &quot;Sun&quot; in 1999 with a quote &quot;I could not bear the thought of turning 40 and working there.&quot;

Mallick later wrote for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; where her left-of-centre political opinion column &quot;As If&quot; was a regular part of the paper&#x27;s Saturday edition until December 2005. She also wrote major and minor pieces for the newspaper on lifestyle and other issues as well as &quot;Chatelaine&quot; magazine. She joined the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in August 2010.

Mallick&#x27;s first book, &quot;Pearls in Vinegar&quot;, was published in September 2004, in Canada. She published a collection of new essays for Knopf Canada in April 2007, entitled &quot;Cake or Death: The Excruciating Choices of Everyday Life&quot;.

In October 2007, Mallick gave the second annual Mel Hurtig Lecture on the Future of Canada, at the University of Alberta.

==Themes==
Shortly after joining &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; in 2010, Mallick wrote an article describing her &quot;painful sordid history&quot; with &quot;Fox News&quot;, &quot;with rancour on their side and disgust on mine.&quot;

In 2010, Montréal, Québec-based Quebecor Media Inc., owned by Pierre Karl Péladeau (PKP), who is also president and CEO of Quebecor Inc., and Sun Media Corporation, was applying to the CRTC, then under the direction of Konrad von Finckenstein, for a &quot;special CRTC-granted status&quot; that would give &quot;Sun TV News&quot; a &quot;&#x27;mandatory&quot; cable deal&#x27;&quot;. Mallick reported that, according to Péladeau, without this concession, the channel would &quot;collapse&quot;. This much sought-after special status would mean the mandatory inclusion of &quot;Sun TV News&quot; in &quot;one tier, or cable package[s]&quot;.

In 2008, after Sarah Palin was selected as the U.S. Republican party&#x27;s Vice-Presidential candidate, Mallick, among other things, labelled Palin as &quot;white trash&quot; and an &quot;Alaskan hillbilly&quot; and likened her to a &quot;toned-down ... porn actress&quot; in a column for the CBC. The column aroused fierce criticism. Jonathan Kay, writing in the &quot;National Post&quot;, accused Mallick of &quot;childish vulgarity&quot; and &quot;hypocrisy&quot; and said that her writing &quot;is haunted by hateful hang-ups about Americans, country-dwellers and the political right. Some of her obsessions are downright weird — such as her prurient insistence that male conservatives embrace bad policy because they are impotent and horny.&quot; An investigation by the CBC ombudsman found that &quot;many of her most savage assertions lack a basis in fact&quot;, and that her aspersions on the sexual inadequacy of Republican men &quot;would easily be seen as, at best, puerile&quot; if &quot;applied to any other group&quot;. The publisher of CBC news, John Cruickshank, apologized for publishing Mallick&#x27;s column, which he called &quot;viciously personal, grossly hyperbolic and intensely partisan&quot;.

The July 22, 2011 Norway attacks, in which dozens of people, including participants of a youth camp in Norway, were perpetrated by Anders Behring Breivik, who was later convicted of mass murder and terrorism. According to a July 26, 2011 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, about 90 minutes before his attacks, Breivik emailed his 1,518 page manifesto, called &quot;A European Declaration of Independence&quot; to 1,003 email addresses with the greeting &quot;Western Europe patriot&quot;. In her July 28, 2011, article, in &quot;The Toronto Sun&quot;, entitled &quot;What to do when a monster likes your work&quot;, Mallick described the recipients of the emails as a &quot;small but select crowd of people in Canada, the U.S. and Europe&quot;, as &quot;agitators who woke up last Saturday to find that the Norwegian monster Anders Breivik liked them.&quot;

A British journalist mentioned in the column, Melanie Phillips, promptly commenced legal action. The &quot;Star&quot; printed an apology, stating in part, &quot;The column made reference to Ms. Phillips&#x27; writings in an entirely misleading and inappropriate manner.&quot; The paper also removed the column from their website, and settled with Phillips for full legal costs, plus a donation to a charity of her choice in lieu of damages.

==Works==

<doc id="658122" wikidata="Q811014" url="?curid=658122" title="Battle of the Year">
<text>Battle of the Year, commonly referred to as BOTY, is an annual international breakdancing competition that began in 1990. It has been regarded as the premier b-boying competition in the world
 and has been referred to as the &quot;World Cup of B-Boying&quot;. Regional qualifying tournaments, also known as &quot;preliminaries&quot;, are held worldwide culminating in the &quot;BOTY International&quot;, the world finals event which is currently held at Sud de France Arena in Montpellier, France.

For the first twenty-three editions, Battle of the Year was a crew competition; in 2013, a one-on-one competition was added. Since 2014, the one-on-one portion of Battle of the Year is one of ten tournaments that are a part of the World BBoy Series.

The competition spawned the 2007 documentary &quot;Planet B-Boy&quot; as well as a 2013 eponymously named feature film &quot;Battle of the Year&quot;, both directed by Benson Lee. It has also gained attention for positive promotion of hip-hop culture and social unity.

==Past Battle of the Year results==

In 2006, 2 semifinal battles were implemented, with the winner of each battle advancing to the finals. The losers of the semifinal battles do not battle each other; therefore, there is no longer a fourth-place award.

Until 2006, one battle was held solely for first place and one battle was held solely for third place.

==Series Format==

=== World Finals Format===
The format comprises firstly a round in which all crews perform a routine of no more than six minutes in length demonstrating their ability in the different styles of breakdance. Judges rank all competing crews by evaluating certain criteria based on the shows.

Following the showcase round, the top four crews are selected to take part in a crew-vs-crew battle playoff. In the semifinals, the top-ranked crew battles the 4th-ranked crew and the 2nd-ranked crew battles the 3rd-ranked crew. The winner of each semifinal then battle each other for the championship.

An award, &quot;Best Show&quot;, is also given to the crew that had the best-scoring showcase.

===Scoring Criteria===
Judges evaluate the showcase round on two main elements, artistry and technicality, each of which includes several criteria. The artistry element includes theme, music, synchronicity, and choreography, among others. The technicality element includes toprock, uprock, footwork, and power moves, among others.

===Qualification and Preliminaries===
The champion of the world finals is always invited directly to the following year&#x27;s world finals to defend their title. All other crews qualify via preliminary tournaments, although historically there have been a few instances of directly-invited crews (usually when there is no preliminary in that crew&#x27;s region).

Qualification is moving towards a two-step system consisting of individual country preliminaries followed by regional preliminaries. Historically, each country had an individual preliminary and sent one crew to the world finals; however, countries have become more and more regionalized over the years. For example, starting in 2007, there is a new BOTY Asia regional preliminary that will send the top 3 finishers to the world finals; in 2006 and years prior, Asia region countries such as South Korea, Japan, China, and Taiwan had their own preliminaries and sent one crew each to the world finals.

The following is a chart showing the regions and countries in the region, as well as number of crews sent to the world finals, for the 2007 season.
&quot;*&quot; Winner of BOTY India will participate in BOTY Asia from 2011
&quot;*&quot; BOTY North East Europe regional preliminary was canceled. On July 10, 2007, it was announced that BOTY North East Europe member countries would be allowed to enter BOTY Scandinavia.
&quot;**&quot; On September 7, 2007, the BOTY USA 2007 qualifier was announced; however, it was canceled less than one month later.

===World Finals Format History===

Prior to 2006, the current championship playoff system was not used. Instead, there were only two battles: two crews would compete for first place, while two other crews would compete for third place. While a &quot;Best Show&quot; award was still granted based on showcase performance, the judges would also rank the crews as to who they thought should participate in the championship battle. This resulted in frequently-occurring situations where the crew that received the &quot;Best Show&quot; award was not even able to compete for the championship, as they were picked for the third place battle instead of the championship battle. Examples include three &quot;Best Show&quot; winners in the final five years under the old format: Break the Funk (2004), Fire Works (2003), and Visual Shock (2001). The change to the playoff system also brought the world finals format into line with some of the qualifier formats, such as the BOTY Korea Preliminary, which has been using the four-crew playoff system for years.

Starting in 2004, a strict 6-minute time limit per crew on the showcase was enforced for the world finals, with scoring penalties assessed for going over time. This was enacted so that the world finals event would finish in a shorter time period. The 6-minute limit was quickly adopted at preliminaries.

In 1990, when the event was known as the &quot;International Breakdance Cup&quot;, there were only shows and no battles. From 1991-1996, there were battles resulting in a crowned champion, but no &quot;Best Show&quot; award was given.

==Media==
An official DVD documenting the event is usually released a few months after the tournament. It is a perennial best seller on breaking and hip-hop media retail web sites.

Several documentaries have been produced based on the competition, including the 2007 feature-length documentary Planet B-Boy. The film premiered at the 2007 TriBeCa Film Festival and was released on DVD on November 11, 2008.

A movie based on this competition, called Battle of the Year, was released on September 20, 2013. The film was directed by Benson Lee, who produced Planet B-Boy, and featured famous artist Chris Brown in the primary role.

On occasion with the annual competition, a CD/LP titled &quot;The Official Battle Of The Year Motion Soundtrack&quot; is released since 1998. It features some of the leading B-Boy Funk artists such as Mr. Confuse, Cosmic EFI, DJ Nas&#x27;D, Esone, Def Cut, Cutmaster GB, and DJ Phantom. The cover artwork is drawn by Graffiti artist Mode 2.

<doc id="658129" wikidata="Q1126170" url="?curid=658129" title="Gluteus medius">
<text>The gluteus medius, one of the three gluteal muscles, is a broad, thick, radiating muscle. It is situated on the outer surface of the pelvis.

Its posterior third is covered by the gluteus maximus, its anterior two-thirds by the gluteal aponeurosis, which separates it from the superficial fascia and integument.

==Structure==
The gluteus medius muscle starts, or &quot;originates&quot;, on the outer surface of the ilium between the iliac crest and the posterior gluteal line above, and the anterior gluteal line below; the gluteus medius also originates from its own fascia, the gluteal aponeurosis, that covers its outer surface.

The fibers of the muscle converge into a strong flattened tendon that inserts on the lateral surface of the greater trochanter. More specifically, the muscle&#x27;s tendon inserts into an oblique ridge that runs downward and forward on the lateral surface of the greater trochanter. Before the insertion the fibers cross from anterior to posterior and vice versa.

===Relations===
A bursa, the &quot;Bursa trochanterica m. glutaei medii&quot;, separates the tendon of the muscle from the surface of the trochanter over which it glides. The deep surface of the gluteus medius is in relation to the gluteus minimus.

===Variations===
The posterior border may be more or less closely united to the piriformis, or some of the fibers end on its tendon.

==Function==
* The anterior part acting alone helps to flex and internally rotate the hip.
* The posterior part acting alone helps to extend and externally rotate the hip.
* The anterior and posterior parts working together abduct the hip and stabilize the pelvis in the coronal plane.
* Most of the muscle inserts behind the centre of rotation of the hip. However, its function changes in different positions of the femur. For example: If the leg is flexed, the whole muscle will flex.
The posterior fibres of gluteus medius contract to produce hip extension, lateral rotation and abduction. During gait, the posterior fibres help to decelerate internal rotation of the femur at the end of swing phase.

Together with the gluteus minimus and other short pelvi-trochanteric muscles it centers and stabilises the hip. Thus, its preservation and the accurate anatomical reconstruction of the femoral offset and anteversion is of quintessential importance for the result of surgical hip replacement.

==Clinical significance==
Dysfunction of the gluteus medius or the superior gluteal nerve can potentially be indicated by a positive Trendelenburg&#x27;s sign.

<text>The gluteus minimus, or glutæus minimus, the smallest of the three gluteal muscles, is situated immediately beneath the gluteus medius.

== Structure ==
It is fan-shaped, arising from the outer surface of the ilium, between the anterior and inferior gluteal lines, and behind, from the margin of the greater sciatic notch.

The fibers converge to the deep surface of a radiated aponeurosis, and this ends in a tendon which is inserted into an impression on the anterior border of the greater trochanter, and gives an expansion to the capsule of the hip joint.

=== Relations ===
A bursa is interposed between the tendon and the greater trochanter.

Between the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus are the deep branches of the superior gluteal vessels and the superior gluteal nerve.

The deep surface of the gluteus minimus is in relation with the reflected tendon of the rectus femoris and the capsule of the hip joint.

=== Variations ===
The muscle may be divided into an anterior and a posterior part, or it may send slips to the piriformis, the superior gemellus or the outer part of the origin of the vastus lateralis.

== Function ==
The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus abduct the thigh, when the limb is extended, and are principally called into action in supporting the body on one limb, in conjunction with the tensor fasciæ latæ.

Their anterior fibers also flex the hip, and by drawing the greater trochanter forward, rotate the thigh inward, in which action they are also assisted by the Tensor fasciæ latæ.

Both gluteus minimus and medius have the same function. Their primary function is abduction of the femur, while internal rotation and flexion can occur depending on the position of the femur. Additionally, with the hip flexed, the gluteus minimus internally rotates the thigh. With the hip extended, gluteus minimus externally rotates the thigh.

It is also a local stabilizer for the hip. The attachment to the superior capsule of the hip may also serve to retract the capsule away from the joint during motion. This mechanism may prevent capsular impingement similar to the role of the articularis genus in the knee.

== Clinical significance ==
Paralysis of this muscle or gluteus medius, such as may be caused by the superior gluteal nerve palsy, can lead to difficulty abducting the leg. People will compensate for their difficulty walking by adopting a Trendelenburg gait.

<doc id="658133" wikidata="Q114434785" url="?curid=658133" title="The Bloody Baron">
<text>&quot;Family Matters&quot; (), more commonly called &quot;The Bloody Baron&quot; (), is a quest in &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot;. It was designed by Paweł Sasko and written by Karolina Stachyra. The quest follows Geralt, the protagonist of the series, as he helps the eponymous Baron find his family in the war-torn region of Velen.

The Bloody Baron has been hailed by multiple journalists as one of the best quests in the game. It won a Golden Joystick Award in 2015 for &quot;Best Gaming Moment.&quot;

== Quest summary ==

=== Background ===
Geralt of Rivia, the protagonist and player character of &quot;The Witcher 3&quot;, is a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher. The game centers on Geralt&#x27;s search for his adopted daughter, Ciri of Cintra, who is on the run from the Wild Hunt. His search leads him to the fortress of the Bloody Baron, a warlord who recently conquered the region of Velen. The Baron admits to harboring Ciri and offers information about her whereabouts in return for finding his missing wife, Anna, and their daughter, Tamara.

=== Locating Tamara ===
Searching the Baron&#x27;s family home, Geralt finds a lost talisman under the floorboards and signs of a violent struggle. The Baron claims to be oblivious, admitting that he often passes out from binge drinking. He suggests that Geralt seek information from a holy man called the pellar.

The pellar performs a divination on the talisman and reveals that Anna was pregnant but had miscarried due to abuse from the Baron, causing the fetus to become an undead creature called a botchling. He explains that the botchling is bonded with Anna and can be used to continue tracking her. Geralt returns to the fortress and confronts a drunken Baron about his abusive rages. The Baron insists that he never hit his daughter but confesses to hitting his wife. He also admits to burying the fetus in an unmarked grave.

Geralt and the Baron visit the grave to find it empty, and the pair are confronted by the botchling. The player is given the choice to kill the botchling and use its blood in another ritual with the pellar, or convince the Baron to hold the botchling in a naming ritual which lifts the curse and earns the botching&#x27;s help. Either option results in Geralt tracking Anna to a nearby fisherman.

The fisherman admits he tried to help the women leave the region, but glowing marks appeared on Anna&#x27;s hands, and she was kidnapped by a fiend. Meanwhile, Tamara found refuge in a nearby town. Geralt finds Tamara but she refuses to return to her father.

=== Locating Anna ===
Geralt reports to the Baron, who is frustrated that Geralt did not retrieve his daughter. The Baron recounts the story of his failed marriage; as a young soldier, the Baron was constantly away, and the hardships of war drove him to alcoholism. He became physically and emotionally distant from Anna, and she proceeded to have an affair. When he found out, he killed Anna&#x27;s lover and their marriage turned from strained to abusive. The player is given the option for Geralt to react with understanding, condemnation, or apathy.

Content that Geralt has fulfilled his promise, the Baron helps track Ciri to the Crookbag Bog. There Geralt finds an old woman with several orphans who affectionately call her &quot;Gran&quot;. Gran reacts coldly to Geralt, but the children direct him to a nearby spirit who may have seen Ciri. Geralt helps the friendly spirit retrieve its voice from a magical object hidden in a monster nest. The spirit then convinces Gran to help Geralt find Ciri. 

Gran shows Geralt a haunted tapestry which speaks in the voices of three women. The tapestry withholds information about Ciri until Geralt defeats a spirit known as the Whispering Hillock. After a confrontation with the Hillock, Geralt learns that three witches called &quot;the Crones&quot; have manipulated him through the tapestry. He deduces that Gran is actually Anna; the Crones have transformed her into their slave by branding her hands. Anna had been using the talisman to protect herself from the Crones, but upon losing it, she became vulnerable and was kidnapped. 

The story can end in one of two ways:

* If Geralt frees the Whispering Hillock, the Crones curse Anna and turn her into a water hag. Geralt can lift the curse and save Anna from her undead fate, but at the cost of her life. When Geralt reports back to the Baron, he has hanged himself due to guilt and grief.
* If Geralt kills the Whispering Hillock, the Crones thank Geralt and abscond with the orphans, hinting at their desire to eat them. Geralt and the Baron find Anna, but she has gone mad from her ordeals. The Baron desperately takes Anna to find a healer and the soldiers at the Baron&#x27;s fortress become more ruthless in his absence.

== Development ==

=== Quest design ===

Quests in &quot;The Witcher 3&quot; are conceptualized by two teams: the writers, who create an overview of what happens in the quest, and the designers, who develop a more detailed outline of the player&#x27;s actions. The teams then collaborate to finalize the overall experience. The &quot;Bloody Baron&quot; quest was designed by Paweł Sasko (lead technical quest designer at CD Projekt RED) and written by Karolina Stachyra.

Sasko revealed the teams&#x27; overall approach to quest design at the Game Developers Conference in 2017. A quest&#x27;s story sequence is typically mapped to a pacing graph that illustrates the relative tension of each scene and story beat, as well as any involved combat or other types of interactive gameplay. Sasko&#x27;s strategy is to avoid using clichés unless they are used self-consciously, and his team frequently discards their initial ideas to adhere to this.
=== Setting and characters ===
According to Sasko, the concept of the quest originated from a single sentence: &quot;Geralt meets a &#x27;Baron&#x27; who wants the Witcher to kill a monster, and offers information about Ciri in return.&quot; The quest is designed to embody the region of Velen &quot;with all of its beauty and troubles&quot;, highlighting its themes of war, famine, death, lost people, magical rituals, and monsters. Sasko&#x27;s approach to the storyline was influenced by his experience growing up in a poor village in the Polish mountains where he saw multiple cases of alcoholism and domestic violence.

Sasko and Stachyra designed the Baron to serve as a contrasting character to Geralt; both men are searching for their families and have a bloody past, but the Baron&#x27;s position as warlord and history of marital abuse complicates his moral standing. The designers focused on the irony of the character who wants to reunite his family being revealed as the one responsible for breaking them up. Sasko also designed The Baron to have charisma and a sense of humor in order to make the player feel conflicted. To that effect, the team intentionally planned the revelation of the Baron&#x27;s abuse to come after the player learned that the Baron had provided refuge to Ciri.

The botchling, a half-bat half-newborn whose name derives from the Polish word for &quot;miscarriage&quot;, was inspired by a demon from Slavic folklore.

=== Themes ===
The development team have called &quot;Family Matters&quot; one of the most difficult quests to design due to its ambitious subjects and nuanced themes. Both Sasko and Stachyra wanted the story to reflect the idea that no one is completely good or completely evil.

Sasko has stated that the choice to forgive the Baron was added as an opportunity for players to reflect on the quest&#x27;s themes and form their own opinion; he noted that a majority of players forgave the Baron and considers that as validation that the team had designed an interesting choice. Stachrya has stated that they feel stories should not necessarily have a happy ending, and Geralt should not always be able to find a perfect solution.

=== Production ===
The Baron was voiced by Tomasz Dedek in the original Polish version and James Clyde in the English translation. Dedek had done dubbing since 1989, but for Clyde (a classically-trained stage actor) this was his first video game role. The script was sent to Clyde in fragments, leading to confusion over the overarching plot of the quest. Clyde consulted with lead writer Borys Pugacz-Muraszkiewicz for clarification during recording sessions.

== Reception ==

VG247 calls &quot;Family Matters&quot; one of the best and most memorable quests in &quot;The Witcher 3&quot;. PC Gamer describes it as the best quest in the game, praising its writing, acting, and dynamic storytelling. PCGamesN also calls it the game&#x27;s best quest, attributing its &quot;emotional punch&quot; to the quality of its writing and voice acting. They further described it as the game&#x27;s most notorious quest, and credit it for the game&#x27;s success in its exploration of the theme of family. The quest has also been called the best in the game by GameSpot.

Polygon highlights the quest&#x27;s cult status among fans, stating that &quot;the Baron&#x27;s deeply sad tale is the first time some players realize the game is something special, [earning] the Bloody Baron a spot on our best characters of last decade list.&quot; They further describe the Bloody Baron&#x27;s quest as &quot;the standout moment in &quot;The Witcher 3&quot;&quot;.

The quest has made several top 10 lists on TheGamer, including those for the game&#x27;s most heartbreaking moments and moments they hoped to see in the adapted television series. TheGamer also calls the quest the peak of the game&#x27;s storytelling, further listing it as one of the most meaningful choices that can only be understood through a replay and one of the game&#x27;s darkest, most difficult choices. The site also attributes two of the game&#x27;s most heartbreaking cut-scenes and two of the game&#x27;s most deserved deaths to the quest.

&quot;Family Matters&quot; was awarded &quot;Best Gaming Moment&quot; at the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards. Developer Chris Avallone cited the critical reception of the quest as a reason for hiring the same writers on the game &quot;Dying Light 2&quot;.

<text>Peridotite ( ) is a dense, coarse-grained igneous rock consisting mostly of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene. Peridotite is ultramafic, as the rock contains less than 45% silica. It is high in magnesium (Mg2+), reflecting the high proportions of magnesium-rich olivine, with appreciable iron. Peridotite is derived from Earth&#x27;s mantle, either as solid blocks and fragments, or as crystals accumulated from magmas that formed in the mantle. The compositions of peridotites from these layered igneous complexes vary widely, reflecting the relative proportions of pyroxenes, chromite, plagioclase, and amphibole.

Peridotite is the dominant rock of the upper part of Earth&#x27;s mantle. The compositions of peridotite nodules found in certain basalts are of special interest along with diamond pipes (kimberlite), because they provide samples of Earth&#x27;s mantle brought up from depths ranging from about 30 km to 200 km or more. Some of the nodules preserve isotope ratios of osmium and other elements that record processes that occurred when Earth was formed, and so they are of special interest to paleogeologists because they provide clues to the early composition of Earth&#x27;s mantle and the complexities of the processes that occurred.

The word &quot;peridotite&quot; comes from the gemstone peridot, which consists of pale green olivine. Classic peridotite is bright green with some specks of black, although most hand samples tend to be darker green. Peridotitic outcrops typically range from earthy bright yellow to dark green; this is because olivine is easily weathered to iddingsite. While green and yellow are the most common colors, peridotitic rocks may exhibit a wide range of colors including blue, brown, and red.

==Classification==
Igneous rocks rich in magnesium and iron with a color index greater than 90 are defined as ultramafic. Ultramafic rocks may be further classified by their relative proportions of olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and hornblende, which are the most abundant families of mafic minerals in most ultramafic rocks. Peridotite is then defined as coarse-grained ultramafic rock in which olivine makes up 40% or more of the total volume of these four mineral families in the rock.

Peridotites are further classified as follows:

* Dunite: more than 90% olivine
: Dunite is found as prominent veins in the peridotite layer of ophiolites, which are interpreted as slices of oceanic lithosphere (crust and upper mantle) thrust onto continents. Dunite also occurs as a cumulate in layered intrusions, where olivine crystallized out of a slowly cooling body of magma and accumulated on the floor of the magma body to form the lowest layer of the intrusion. Dunite almost always contains accessory chromite.

*Kimberlite: formed in volcanic pipes and at least 35% olivine
: Kimberlite is a highly brecciated variant of peridotite formed in volcanic pipes and is known for being the host rock to diamonds. Unlike other forms of peridotite, kimberlite is quite rare.

* Pyroxene peridotite: From 40% to 90% olivine and less than 5% hornblende
** Harzburgite: less than 5% clinopyroxene
:: Harzburgite makes up the bulk of the peridotite layer of ophiolites. It is interpreted as depleted mantle rock, from which basaltic magma has been extracted. It also forms as a cumulate in Type I layered intrusions, forming a layer just above the dunite layer. Harzburgite likely makes up most of the mantle lithosphere underneath continental cratons.
:* Wehrlite: less than 5% orthopyroxene
:: Wehrlite makes up part of the transition zone between the peridotite layer and overlying gabbro layer of ophiolites. In Type II layered intrusions, it takes the place of harzburgite as the layer just above the dunite layer.

:* Lherzolite: intermediate content of clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene
:: Lherzolite is thought to make up much of the upper mantle. It has almost exactly the composition of a mixture of three parts harzburgite and one part tholeiitic basalt (&quot;pyrolite&quot;) and is the likely source rock for basaltic magma. It is found as rare xenoliths in basalt, such as those of Kilbourne Hole in southern New Mexico, US, and at Oahu, Hawaii, US.

* Hornblende peridotite: From 40% to 90% olivine and less than 5% pyroxene
: Hornblende peridotite is found as rare xenoliths in andesites above subduction zones. They are direct evidence of alteration of mantle rock by fluids released by the subducting slab.

* Pyroxene hornblende peridotite: Intermediate between pyroxene peridotite and hornblende peridotite
: Pyroxene hornblende peridotite is found as rare xenoliths, such as those of Wilcza Góra in southwest Poland. Here it likely formed by alteration of mantle rock by carbonated hydrous silicic fluids associated with volcanism.

==Composition==

Mantle peridotite is highly enriched in magnesium, with a typical magnesium number of 89. In other words, of the total content of iron plus magnesium, 89 mol% is magnesium. This is reflected in the composition of the mafic minerals making up the peridotite.

Olivine is the essential mineral found in all peridotites. It is an iron-magnesium orthosilicate with the variable formula . The magnesium-rich olivine of peridotites is typically olive-green in color.

Pyroxenes are chain silicates having the variable formula comprising a large group of different minerals. These are divided into orthopyroxenes (with an orthorhombic crystal structure) and clinopyroxenes (with a monoclinic crystal structure). This distinction is important in the classification of pyroxene peridotites since clinopyroxene melts more easily than orthopyroxene or olivine. The most common orthopyroxene is enstatite, , in which iron substitutes for some of the magnesium. The most important clinopyroxene is diopside, , again with some substitution of iron for magnesium (hedenbergite, ). Ultramafic rock in which the fraction of pyroxenes exceeds 60% are classified as pyroxenites rather than peridotites. Pyroxenes are typically dark in color.

Hornblende is an amphibole, a group of minerals resembling pyroxenes but with a double chain structure incorporating water. Hornblende itself has a highly variable composition, ranging from tschermakite () to pargasite () with many other variations in composition. It is present in peridotite mostly as a consequence of alteration by hydrous fluids.

Although peridotites are classified by their content of olivine, pyroxenes, and hornblende, a number of other mineral families are characteristically present in peridotites and may make up a significant fraction of their composition. For example, chromite is sometimes present in amounts of up to 50%. (A chromite composition above 50% reclassifies the rock as a &quot;peridotitic chromitite&quot;.) Other common accessory minerals include spinel, garnet, biotite, or magnetite. A peridotite containing significant amounts of one of these minerals may have its classification refined accordingly; for example, if a lhertzolite contains up to 5% spinel, it is a &quot;spinel-bearing lhertzolite&quot;, while for amounts up to 50%, it would be classified as a &quot;spinel lhertzolite&quot;. The accessory minerals can be useful for estimating the depth of formation of the peridotite. For example, the aluminium in lhertzolite is present as plagioclase at depths shallower than about , while it is present as spinel between 20 km and and as garnet below 60 km.

==Distribution and location==
Peridotite is the dominant rock of the Earth&#x27;s mantle above a depth of about 400 km; below that depth, olivine is converted to the higher-pressure mineral wadsleyite.

Oceanic plates consist of up to about 100 km of peridotite covered by a thin crust. The crust, commonly about 6 km thick, consists of basalt, gabbro, and minor sediments. The peridotite below the ocean crust, &quot;abyssal peridotite,&quot; is found on the walls of rifts in the deep sea floor. Oceanic plates are usually subducted back into the mantle in subduction zones. However, pieces can be emplaced into or overthrust on continental crust by a process called obduction, rather than carried down into the mantle. The emplacement may occur during orogenies, as during collisions of one continent with another or with an island arc. The pieces of oceanic plates emplaced within continental crust are referred to as ophiolites. Typical ophiolites consist mostly of peridotite plus associated rocks such as gabbro, pillow basalt, diabase sill-and-dike complexes, and red chert. &quot;Alpine peridotite&quot; or &quot;orogenic peridotite massif&quot; is an older term for an ophiolite emplaced in a mountain belt during a continent-continent plate collision.

Peridotites also occur as fragments (xenoliths) carried up by magmas from the mantle. Among the rocks that commonly include peridotite xenoliths are basalt and kimberlite. Although kimberlite is a variant of peridotite, kimberlite is also considered as brecciated volcanic material as well, which is why it is referred to as a source of peridotite xenoliths. Peridotite xenoliths contain osmium and other elements whose stable isotope ratios provide clues on the formation and evolution of the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Such xenoliths originate from depths of up to nearly or more.

The volcanic equivalent of peridotites are komatiites, which were mostly erupted early in the Earth&#x27;s history and are rare in rocks younger than Archean in age.

Small pieces of peridotite have been found in lunar breccias.

The rocks of the peridotite family are uncommon at the surface and are highly unstable, because olivine reacts quickly with water at typical temperatures of the upper crust and at the Earth&#x27;s surface. Many, if not most, surface outcrops have been at least partly altered to serpentinite, a process in which the pyroxenes and olivines are converted to green serpentine. This hydration reaction involves considerable increase in volume with concurrent deformation of the original textures. Serpentinites are mechanically weak and so flow readily within the earth. Distinctive plant communities grow in soils developed on serpentinite, because of the unusual composition of the underlying rock. One mineral in the serpentine group, chrysotile, is a type of asbestos.

==Color, morphology, and texture==

Most peridotite is green in color due to its high olivine content. However, peridotites can range in color from greenish-gray to nearly black to pale yellowish-green. Peridotite weathers to form a distinctive brown crust in subaerial exposures and to a deep orange color in submarine exposures.

Peridotites can take on a massive form or may be in layers on a variety of size scales. Layered peridotites may form the base layers of layered intrusions. These are characterized by cumulate textures, characterized by a fabric of coarse (&gt;5mm) interlocking euhedral (well-formed) crystals in a groundmass of finer crystals formed from liquid magma trapped in the cumulate. Many show poikilitic texture in which crystallization of this liquid has produced crystals that overgrow and enclose the original cumulus crystals (called &quot;chadrocrysts&quot;).

Another texture is a &quot;well-annealed&quot; texture of equal sized anhedral crystals with straight grain boundaries intersecting at 120°. This may result when slow cooling allowed recrystallization to minimize surface energy. Cataclastic texture, showing irregular fractures and deformation twinning of olivine grains, is common in peridotites because of the deformation associated with their tectonic mode of emplacement.

==Origin==

Peridotites have two primary modes of origin: as mantle rocks formed during the accretion and differentiation of the Earth, or as cumulate rocks formed by precipitation of olivine ± pyroxenes from basaltic or ultramafic magmas. These magmas are ultimately derived from the upper mantle by partial melting of mantle peridotites.

Mantle peridotites are sampled as ophiolites in collisional mountain ranges, as xenoliths in basalt or kimberlite, or as abyssal peridotites (sampled from ocean floor). These rocks represent either fertile mantle (lherzolite) or partially depleted mantle (harzburgite, dunite). Alpine peridotites may be either of the ophiolite association and representing the uppermost mantle below ocean basins, or masses of subcontinental mantle emplaced along thrust faults in mountain belts.

Layered peridotites are igneous sediments and form by mechanical accumulation of dense olivine crystals. They form from mantle-derived magmas, such as those of basalt composition. Peridotites associated with Alaskan-type ultramafic complexes are cumulates that probably formed in the root zones of volcanoes. Cumulate peridotites are also formed in komatiite lava flows.

==Associated rocks==
Komatiites are high temperature partial melts of peridotite characterized by a high degree of partial melting deep below the surface.

Eclogite is a metamorphic rock composed primarily of omphacite (sodic clinopyroxene) and pyrope-rich garnet. Eclogite is associated with peridotite in some xenolith occurrences; it also occurs with peridotite in rocks metamorphosed at high pressures during processes related to subduction.

==Economic geology==
Peridotite may potentially be used in a low-cost, safe and permanent method of capturing and storing atmospheric CO2 as part of climate change-related greenhouse gas sequestration. It was already known that peridotite reacts with CO2 to form a solid carbonate-like limestone or marble mineral; and this process can be sped up a million times or more by simple drilling and hydraulic fracturing to allow injection of the CO2 into the subsurface peridotite formation.

Peridotite is named for the gemstone peridot, a glassy green gem originally mined on St. John&#x27;s Island in the Red Sea and now mined on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona.

Peridotite that has been hydrated at low temperatures is the protolith for serpentinite, which may include chrysotile asbestos (a form of serpentine) and talc.

Layered intrusions with cumulate peridotite are typically associated with sulfide or chromite ores. Sulfides associated with peridotites form nickel ores and platinoid metals; most of the platinum used in the world today is mined from the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa and the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe. The chromite bands found in peridotites are the world&#x27;s major source of chromium.

<doc id="658146" wikidata="Q195567" url="?curid=658146" title="Acanthophis">
<text>Acanthophis is a genus of elapid snakes. Commonly called death adders, they are native to Australia, New Guinea and nearby islands, and are among the most venomous snakes in the world. Despite their common name, they are not adders at all and belong to the Elapidae family (like cobras). The name of the genus derives from the Ancient Greek / (&#x27;spine&#x27;) and / (&#x27;snake&#x27;), referring to the spine on the death adder&#x27;s tail.

Eight species are listed by ITIS, though it remains unclear how many species this genus includes, with figures ranging from 4 to 15 species being quoted.

== Taxonomy ==
French naturalist François Marie Daudin established the genus &quot;Acanthophis&quot; in 1803, with the common death adder (&quot;A. cerastinus&quot;) as its only species.

Although the death adders resemble vipers of the family Viperidae, they are actually members of the family Elapidae, which includes cobras, mambas, and coral snakes.

It remains unclear how many species are included in this genus. Traditionally, only &quot;A. antarcticus&quot;, &quot;A. praelongus&quot; and &quot;A. pyrrhus&quot; have been recognised. In 1985, Wells &amp; Wellington proposed four new species – &quot;A. armstrongi&quot;, &quot;A. hawkei&quot;, &quot;A. lancasteri&quot;, and &quot;A. schistos&quot; – but these were not widely adopted at the time. In 1998 five new species were described (&quot;A. barnetti&quot;, &quot;A. crotalusei&quot;, &quot;A. cummingi&quot;, &quot;A. wellsi&quot; and &quot;A. woolfi&quot;) and in 2002 an additional three were described (&quot;A. groenveldi&quot;, &quot;A. macgregori&quot; and &quot;A. yuwoni&quot;). These were received with scepticism, and only &quot;A. wellsi&quot;, where an extended description has been published, has been widely recognised. Further confusion exists over the death adders from Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. They have variously been placed in &quot;A. antarcticus&quot; or &quot;A. praelongus&quot;. In 2005 it was shown that neither is appropriate, and the New Guinea death adders fall into two main clades: The rather smooth-scaled &quot;A. laevis&quot; complex (including death adders from Seram), and the rough-scaled &quot;A. rugosus&quot; complex. The latter can be divided into two sub-clades; one, &quot;A. rugosus sensu stricto&quot;, from southern New Guinea, and a second, &quot;A. hawkei&quot;, from northern Queensland and the Northern Territory in Australia. It is likely some of these include more than one species, as populations included in e.g. &quot;A. laevis&quot; show extensive variation in both pattern and scalation.

=== Species ===

* Not including the nominate subspecies.
TType species.

== Description ==
Death adders are very viper-like in appearance, having a short, robust body, triangular shaped heads, small subocular scales, many small scales on the top of the head, and elevated supraocular scales. Dorsal scales may be smooth or keeled. Body patterning is generally crossbanding, and they have vertically elliptical pupils. Their fangs are also longer and more mobile than for most other elapids, although still far from the size seen in some of the true vipers. Despite their name, they are not related to adders, which are members of the family Viperidae, and their similar appearance is due to convergent evolution.

They normally take 2–3 years to reach adult size. Females are generally slightly larger than the males. They can also be easily distinguished from other Australian snakes because of a small, worm like lure on the end of their tail, which is used to attract prey. Most have large bands around their bodies, though the colour itself is variable, depending on their locality. Colours are usually black, grey or red and yellow, but also include brown and greenish-grey.

Death adders are ovoviviparous with the embryos developing in membranous sacs inside the female who will give birth to litters of 8 to 30 live neonates.

== Origin of name ==
Early settlers of Australia called them &quot;deaf adders&quot;. How &quot;deaf&quot; became &quot;death&quot; is not recorded.

Unlike other snakes that tend to flee from human disturbance, the death adder is inclined to hold its ground, leading to the notion that the death adder cannot hear. However, death adders, like other snakes, perceive ground vibrations.

== Hunting ==

Unlike most snakes, death adders do not actively hunt, but rather lie in ambush and draw their prey to them. When hungry, death adders bury themselves among the substrate. This may be leaf litter, soil or sand, depending on their environment. The only part of themselves they expose are their head and their tail, both generally very well camouflaged. The end of the tail is used for caudal luring and when wiggled, it is easily mistaken for a grub or worm. When the snake&#x27;s prey attempts to seize it, the death adder strikes. Although it has been claimed to have the quickest strike of any snake in the world, this topic has not been well enough studied to make reliable comparisons. They commonly feed on local geckos such as the Dubious dtella.

== Venom ==
Death adders can inject on average 40–100 mg of highly toxic venom with a bite. The of the venom was reported as 0.4–0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous and it is completely neurotoxic, containing neither haemotoxins nor myotoxins, unlike the venoms of most venomous snakes.

A bite from a death adder can cause paralysis which seems minor at first but can cause death from a complete respiratory shutdown in six hours. Symptoms of envenomation can be reversed through the use of death adder antivenom, or using anticholinesterases, which break the synaptic blockade by making acetylcholine more available to the parasympathetic nervous system, thus mitigating the effects of the venom.

Before antivenom was introduced, it is reported that about 50% of death adder bites were fatal. A fatal bite is less likely now as the anti-venom is widely available and the progression of envenomation symptoms is slow.

<doc id="658150" wikidata="Q1276110" url="?curid=658150" title="Jackie Curtis">
<text>Jackie Curtis (February 19, 1947 – May 15, 1985) was an American underground actor, singer, and playwright best known as a Warhol superstar. Primarily a stage actor in New York City, Curtis performed as both a man and in drag. 

Curtis made his stage debut as Nefertiti&#x27;s brother in Tom Eyen&#x27;s play &quot;Miss Nefertiti Regrets&quot; (1965). He subsequently wrote several plays, including &quot;Glamour, Glory and Gold&quot; (1967), &quot;Amerika Cleopatra&quot; (1968), and &quot;Vain Victory: Vicissitudes of the Damned&quot; (1971). Curtis appeared in the films &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Flesh&quot; (1968), directed by Paul Morrissey, and starred in &quot;Women in Revolt&quot; (1971), a comedic spoof of the women&#x27;s liberation movement. 

While performing in drag on stage and screen, Curtis would typically wear lipstick, glitter, bright red hair, ripped dresses, and stockings. Curtis pioneered this combination of camp trashy glamour as a style that inspired many entertainers, including Jayne County, the New York Dolls, and glam rock performers such as David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Gary Glitter and Mott the Hoople.

==Life and career==
Jackie Curtis was born John Curtis Holder Jr. in New York City to singer John Holder and Jenevive Uglialoro and had one sibling, half-brother Timothy Holder, who is an openly gay Episcopal priest. Their parents divorced and Curtis was mostly raised by maternal grandmother Slugger Ann (Ann Uglialoro), an East Village bar owner.

In 1965, Curtis appeared in Tom Eyen&#x27;s play &quot;Miss Nefertiti Regrets&quot; at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club along with fellow newcomer Bette Midler. Curtis reprised the role as Ptolemy II. 

Curtis&#x27; play &quot;Glamour, Glory and Gold&quot;, which chronicled the ascent and decline of a female film star, debuted in an East Village basement in 1967. The play starred Darling, Melba LaRose, Jr., and Robert De Niro in his first appearance on stage, playing several roles. Curtis played a supporting part as a witty chorus dancer. The program notes explained that Curtis was an emergency fill-in since the girl cast in the part had abruptly quit. &quot;This seemed to account for the strangely amorphous portrayal, neither male nor female, but a comedic talent&quot; said Ernest Leogrande of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

Curtis took the starring roles in his following plays. He followed up his theatrical debut with a musical called &quot;Lucky Wonderful&quot; (1968) featuring featuring Candy Darling, Paul Serrato, Holly Woodlawn, and Melba LaRose. The playboy socialite Tommy Manville, who had a number of odd and exotic spouses, served as the inspiration for the play.

The paly &quot;Amerika Cleopatra&quot; (1968) featured Agosto Machado and Harvey Fierstein and ran at the WPA Theatre.

In 1968, Curtis was cast in the Warhol-produced film &quot;Flesh&quot; (1968), which was directed by Paul Morrissey. Curtis then starred alongside transgender Warhol superstars Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn in &quot;Women in Revolt&quot; (1971), which satirizes the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement and alludes to Valerie Solanas and her &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot;. Warhol said of Curtis, &quot;Jackie Curtis is not a drag queen. Jackie is an artist. A pioneer without a frontier.&quot; Years later when Warhol attended a Boy George concert, he remarked, &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t like him because it reminded me of what Jackie Curtis could have been.&quot;

Curtis had arranged to marry Warhol superstar Eric Emerson as a publicity stunt on July 21, 1969. When Emerson failed to show up, Curtis married a wedding guest. The mock wedding was covered by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. 

In 1969, Curtis performed with the Playhouse of the Ridiculous in Tom Murrin&#x27;s &quot;Cock-Strong&quot; alongside Penny Arcade, Anthony Ingrassia, and others. Music for the production was written by Ralph Czitrom and performed by the Silver Apples.

In between filming with Warhol and Morrissey, Curtis continued to write plays. The play &quot;Heaven Grand in Amber Orbit&quot; (1970) with Ruby Lynn Reyner and Holly Woodlawn ran at the Playhouse of the Ridiculous for weeks. Another play, &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; (1970) starred Patti Smith, Jayne County and Penny Arcade.

Curtis wrote &quot;Vain Victory: The Vicissitudes Of The Damned&quot; and co-directed a production of the play at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club and the WPA in 1971. The play starred Candy Darling and Mario Montez.

In 1974, Curtis and Holly Woodlawn performed together in &quot;Cabaret in the Sky: An Evening with Holly Woodlawn and Jackie Curtis&quot; at the New York Cultural Center. The poster for the show was designed by &quot;Interview&quot; magazine illustrator Richard Bernstein. 

Reportedly, Curtis graduated from Hunter College in 1975, but this can not be confirmed because no diploma has been found.

Curtis&#x27;s poem &quot;B-Girls&quot;, much of which is based on observations of people who visited grandmother Slugger Ann&#x27;s bar, was included in the 1979 book &quot;The Poets&#x27; Encyclopedia&quot;. At eight pages long, it was the longest poem in the book.

Curtis directed and performed in Nick Markovich&#x27;s &quot;I Died Yesterday&quot; at La MaMa in 1983. Curtis portrayed a nurse in the documentary film &quot;Burroughs&quot; (1983).

Curtis had a second wedding ceremony on May 26, 1984, with Gary Majchrzak as the groom and Curtis being given away by art dealer Leo Castelli.

Curtis&#x27;s final play &quot;Champagne&quot; ran at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club January 3–27, 1985 and featured George Abagnalo as the male lead.

In 1985, Curtis used the name Shannon Montgomery and started going to the HB Studio for acting classes. New headshots of him were taken by photographer Francesco Scavullo and he began to audition for male parts in soap operas and plays in New York.

==Death==
Curtis had a heroin addiction, and died from an overdose in on May 15, 1985. The wake was held at the Andrett Funeral Home, while the funeral service took place in St. Ann Church in New York. Curtis was laid to rest as a man wearing a suit, with a white flower on his lapel and his hair slicked back. A plaque bearing the words &quot;John Holder, a.k.a. Jackie Curtis&quot; and show business mementos were placed inside his coffin. Photographs of Curtis in drag were displayed on poster boards.

Upon hearing news of Curtis&#x27; death, Warhol recorded in his diary, &quot;It was an awful day ... somebody called and said that Jackie Curtis O.D.&#x27;d. He&#x27;s gone. And that wasn&#x27;t something I wanted to hear.&quot; The following week, Warhol said, &quot;Somebody told me that Jackie Curtis had a long obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. I still keep wanting to think it was a put-on like his weddings.&quot;

== Gender identity ==
Throughout his adult life, Curtis dressed as both a woman and a man. He had taken on a male persona and was auditioning for male roles the year he died. Photographer Peter Hujar took a photo of Curtis in his casket wearing a suit, lying next to a picture of himself in drag.

In an article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in November 1969, Curtis was quoted saying, &quot;not a boy, not a girl, not a faggot, not a drag queen, not a transsexual — just me, Jackie ... I&#x27;m not trying to pass as a woman.&quot;

&quot;In 1968, Jackie lived as a woman twenty-four hours a day. She sort of became Marisa Berenson,&quot; said journalist Michael Musto in his 1986 &quot;Village Voice&quot; feature on Curtis. &quot;In 1972, she/he returned to facial hair. . . . And in 1985, Jackie looked back on that era and told me: &#x27;I&#x27;d say, &quot;I&#x27;m tired of being Jackie Curtis,&quot; and someone would say, &quot;But you have to be. We need Jackie Curtis.&quot; But it was a chore and I was already turning my auto-suggestive possession into a reincarnation of James Dean. I wanted to play James Dean, so I became him.&#x27;&quot;

==Legacy ==
Curtis is named in Lou Reed&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; which was about the &#x27;superstars&#x27; he knew from Warhol&#x27;s Factory. The verse speaks of her drug addiction and fascination with James Dean: &quot;Jackie is just speeding away / Thought she was James Dean for a day / Then I guess she had to crash / Valium would have helped that bash&quot;.

In 2004, a documentary &quot;Superstar in a Housedress&quot; exposed some little-known facts about Curtis to a wider public. Curtis&#x27;s influence on a number of people, including friends and associates such as Holly Woodlawn, Joe Dallesandro, and Penny Arcade, and observers such as David Bowie, are noted in the film. Jayne County writes of Curtis as being &quot;the biggest influence on me at this time.&quot;

An album by Paul Serrato collecting songs from the Curtis works &quot;Lucky Wonderful&quot; and &quot;Vain Victory&quot;, including the love ballad &quot;Who Are You&quot;, which Curtis sang to Darling, was released in 2004.

<doc id="658155" wikidata="Q17164695" url="?curid=658155" title="Lumbar spinal stenosis">
<text>Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a medical condition in which the spinal canal narrows and compresses the nerves and blood vessels at the level of the lumbar vertebrae. Spinal stenosis may also affect the cervical or thoracic region, in which case it is known as cervical spinal stenosis or thoracic spinal stenosis. Lumbar spinal stenosis can cause pain in the low back or buttocks, abnormal sensations, and the absence of sensation (numbness) in the legs, thighs, feet, or buttocks, or loss of bladder and bowel control.
The precise cause of LSS is unclear. Narrowing of spinal structures in the spinal cord such as the central canal, the lateral recesses, or the intervertebral foramen (the opening where a spinal nerve root passes) must be present, but are not sufficient to cause LSS alone. Many people who undergo MRI imaging are found to have such changes but have no symptoms. These changes are commonly seen in people who have spinal degeneration that occurs with aging (e.g., spinal disc herniation). LSS may also be caused by osteophytes, osteoporosis, a tumor, trauma, or various skeletal dysplasias, such as with pseudoachondroplasia and achondroplasia.
Medical professionals may clinically diagnose lumbar spinal stenosis using a combination of a thorough medical history, physical examination, and imaging (CT or MRI). EMG may be helpful if the diagnosis is unclear. Useful clues that support a diagnosis of LSS are age; radiating leg pain that worsens with prolonged standing or walking (neurogenic claudication) and is relieved by sitting, lying down, or bending forward at the waist; and a wide stance when walking. Other helpful clues may include objective weakness or decreased sensation in the legs, decreased reflexes in the legs, and balance difficulties, all of which are strongly associated with LSS. Most people with LSS qualify for initial conservative non-operative treatment. Nonsurgical treatments include medications, physiotherapy, and injection procedures. Decompressive spinal surgery may modestly improve outcomes but carries greater risk than conservative treatment. Overall, there is limited supporting evidence to determine the most effective surgical or nonsurgical treatment for people with symptomatic LSS. Evidence to support the use of acupuncture is also limited.
Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common condition and causes substantial morbidity and disability. It is the most common reason people over the age of 65 pursue spinal surgery. The condition affects over 200,000 people in the United States.

==Signs and symptoms==
Understanding the meaning of signs and symptoms of lumbar stenosis requires an understanding of what the syndrome is, and the prevalence of the condition. A review of lumbar stenosis in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; &quot;Rational Clinical Examination Series&quot; emphasized that the syndrome can be considered when lower extremity pain occurs in combination with back pain. The syndrome occurs in 12% of older community-dwelling men and up to 21% of those in retirement communities.

Because the leg symptoms in lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) are similar to those found with vascular claudication, the term pseudoclaudication is often used for symptoms of LSS. These symptoms include pain, weakness, and tingling of the legs, which may radiate down the legs to the feet. Additional symptoms in the legs may be fatigue, heaviness, weakness, a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness, and leg cramps, as well as bladder symptoms. Symptoms are most commonly bilateral and symmetrical, but they may be unilateral; leg pain is usually more troubling than back pain.

Pseudoclaudication, now generally referred to as neurogenic claudication, typically worsens with standing or walking, and improves with sitting, and is often related to posture and lumbar extension. Lying on the side is often more comfortable than lying flat, since it permits greater lumbar flexion. Vascular claudication can resemble spinal stenosis, and some individuals experience unilateral or bilateral symptoms radiating down the legs rather than true claudication.

The first symptoms of stenosis include bouts of low back pain. After a few months or years, this may progress to claudication. The pain may be radicular, following the classic neurologic pathways. This occurs as the spinal nerves or spinal cord become increasingly trapped in a smaller space within the canal. Determining whether pain in the elderly is caused by lack of blood supply or stenosis is difficult; testing can usually differentiate between them, but patients can have both vascular disease in the legs and spinal stenosis.

Among people with lower-extremity pain in combination with back pain, lumbar stenosis as the cause is two times more likely in those older than 70 years of age while in those younger than 60 years it is less than half as likely. The character of the pain is also useful for diagnosis. When the discomfort does not occur while seated, the likelihood of lumbar spinal stenosis increases considerably, around 7.4 times. Other features increasing the likelihood of lumbar stenosis are improvement in symptoms on bending forward (6.4 times), pain that occurs in both buttocks or legs (6.3 times), and the presence of neurogenic claudication (3.7 times). On the other hand, the absence of neurogenic claudication makes lumbar stenosis much less likely as the explanation for the pain.

==Causes==

Spinal stenosis may be congenital (rarely) or acquired (degenerative), overlapping changes normally seen in the aging spine.
Stenosis can occur as either central stenosis (the narrowing of the entire canal) or foraminal stenosis (the narrowing of the foramen through which the nerve root exits the spinal canal). Severe narrowing of the lateral portion of the canal is called lateral recess stenosis. The ligamentum flavum (yellow ligament), an important structural component intimately adjacent to the posterior portion of the dural sac (nerve sac) can become thickened and cause stenosis. The articular facets, also in the posterior portion of the bony spine can become thickened and enlarged, causing stenosis. These changes are often called &quot;trophic changes&quot; or &quot;facet trophism&quot; in radiology reports. As the canal becomes smaller, resembling a triangular shape, it is called a &quot;trefoil&quot; canal.

===Degenerative spondylolisthesis===

Forward displacement of a proximal vertebra in relation to its adjacent vertebra in association with an intact neural arch, and in the presence of degenerative changes, is known as degenerative spondylolisthesis, which narrows the spinal canal, and symptoms of spinal stenosis are common. Of these, neural claudication is most common. Any forward slipping of one vertebra on another can cause spinal stenosis by narrowing the canal. If this forward slipping narrows the canal sufficiently, and impinges on the contents of the spinal column, it is spinal stenosis by definition. If associated symptoms of narrowing exist, the diagnosis of spinal stenosis is confirmed. With increasing age, the occurrence of degenerative spondylolisthesis becomes more common. The most common spondylolisthesis occurs with slipping of L4 on L5. Frymoyer showed that spondylolisthesis with canal stenosis is more common in diabetic women who have undergone oophorectomy (removal of ovaries). The cause of symptoms in the legs can be difficult to determine. A peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes can have the same symptoms as spinal stenosis.

===Ankylosing spondylitis===


== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is based on clinical findings. Some patients can have a narrowed canal without symptoms, and do not require therapy.

The normal lumbar central canal has a midsagittal diameter (front to back) greater than 13 mm, with an area of 1.45 cm2. Relative stenosis is said to exist when the anterior-posterior canal diameter measures between 10 and 13 mm. Absolute stenosis of the lumbar canal exists anatomically when the anterior-posterior measurement is 10 mm or less.

Plain X-rays of the lumbar or cervical spine may or may not show spinal stenosis. The definitive diagnosis is established by either computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Identifying the presence of a narrowed canal makes the diagnosis of spinal stenosis.

=== Bicycle test of van Gelderen ===
In 1977, Dyck and Doyle reported on the bicycle test, a simple procedure in which the patient is asked to pedal on a stationary bicycle. If the symptoms are caused by peripheral artery disease, the patient will experience claudication, a sensation of not getting enough blood to the legs; if the symptoms are caused by lumbar stenosis, symptoms will be relieved when the patient is leaning forward while bicycling. Although diagnostic progress has been made with newer technical advances, the bicycle test remains an inexpensive and easy way to distinguish between claudication caused by vascular disease and spinal stenosis.

===MRI===

MRI is the preferred method of diagnosing and evaluating spinal stenosis of all areas of the spine, including cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. MRI is useful to diagnose cervical spondylotic myelopathy (degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine with associated damage to the spinal cord). The finding of degeneration of the cervical spinal cord on MRI can be ominous; the condition is called myelomalacia or cord degeneration. It is seen as an increased signal on the MRI. In myelopathy (pathology of the spinal cord) from degenerative changes, the findings are usually permanent and decompressive laminectomy will not reverse the pathology. Surgery can stop the progression of the condition. In cases where the MRI changes are due to vitamin B12 deficiency, a brighter prospect for recovery can be expected.

===Establishing the diagnosis===
The detection of spinal stenosis in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine confirms only the anatomic presence of a stenotic condition. This may or may not correlate with the diagnosis of spinal stenosis which is based on clinical findings of radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication, weakness, bowel and bladder dysfunction, spasticity, motor weakness, hyperreflexia and muscular atrophy. These findings, taken from the history and physical examination of the patient (along with the anatomic demonstration of stenosis with an MRI or CT scan), establish the diagnosis.

==Management==
Nonoperative therapies and laminectomy are the standard treatment for LSS. A trial of conservative treatment is typically recommended. Individuals are generally advised to avoid stressing the lower back, particularly with the spine extended. A physical-therapy program to provide core strengthening and aerobic conditioning may be recommended. Overall scientific evidence is inconclusive on whether conservative approach or a surgical treatment is better for lumbar spinal stenosis.

===Medication===
The evidence for the use of medical interventions for LSS is poor. Injectable but not nasal calcitonin may be useful for short-term pain relief. Epidural blocks may also transiently decrease pain, but no evidence of long-term effect has been found. Adding corticosteroids to these injections does not improve the result; the use of epidural steroid injections is controversial and evidence of their efficacy is contradictory.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics are often used to treat low back pain, but evidence of their efficacy is lacking.

===Surgery===

Surgery appears to lead to better outcomes if symptoms continue after 3–6 months of conservative treatment. Laminectomy is the most effective of the surgical treatments. In those who worsen despite conservative treatments surgery leads to improvement in 60–70% of cases. Another procedure using an interspinous distraction device known as X-STOP was less effective and more expensive when more than one spinal levels are repaired. Both surgical procedures are more expensive than medical management.

== Prognosis ==

Most people with mild to moderate symptoms do not get worse. While many improve in the short term after surgery, this improvement decreases somewhat with time. A number of factors present before surgery are able to predict the outcome after surgery, with people with depression, cardiovascular disease, and scoliosis doing in general worse, while those with more severe stenosis beforehand and better overall health doing better.

The natural evolution of disc disease and degeneration leads to stiffening of the intervertebral joint. This leads to osteophyte formation—a bony overgrowth about the joint. This process is called spondylosis, and is part of the normal aging of the spine. This has been seen in studies of normal and diseased spines. Degenerative changes begin to occur without symptoms as early as age 25–30 years. Not uncommonly, people experience at least one severe case of low back pain by the age of 35. This can be expected to improve and become less prevalent as the individual develops osteophyte formation around the discs.

In the US workers&#x27; compensation system, once the threshold of two major spinal surgeries is reached, the vast majority of workers never return to any form of gainful employment. Beyond two spinal surgeries, any more are likely to make the patient worse, not better.

== Epidemiology ==
There are many causes for spinal stenosis but degenerative changes are a precursor to spinal stenosis becoming symptomatic. While the exact prevalence of degenerative LSS is unknown, it is estimated that it ranges from 1.7% to 13.1%. However, the results from these statistics have been put into question. This is mainly due to unclear diagnostic criteria. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are the most common ways to diagnosis LSS, but clinically significant definitions of canal, foraminal, or subarticular narrowing do not exist.

In addition to this, the lumbar and cervical types are more common than the rarer thoracic stenosis. Although stenosis can be found isolated in one region of the spine, developmental spinal stenosis will most likely involve both the cervical and lumbar sections.

The age that people develop spinal stenosis is correlated with change in the joint&#x27;s biomechanics. Because of this, there has been a recent increasing trend seen by physicians, of lumbar spinal stenosis being more commonly diagnosed in older patients. Low back pain accounts for 17% of all physician visits of people aged 65 and older. From this population, a large portion of radicular pain stems not from disk pathology, but from lumbar spinal stenosis. According to Kalff et al., 21% of people over the age of 60 have lumbar spinal stenosis, as confirmed by radiological screening. Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis has been predominantly seen in the 50 to 60-year-old population. A recent study in Japan found that the incidence of LSS increases with age. The study supports that LSS incidence increases incrementally in the following age groups, 1.7–2.2% in 40–49 years old population, and 10.3%–11.2% in 70–79 years old population. It is estimated that around 200,000 adults are affected by LSS in the United States and that by the year 2025, this number will rise to 64 million elderly. The syndrome occurs in 12% of older community-dwelling men and up to 21% of those in retirement communities.

Spinal stenosis generally affects more men than women. A study in Geneva found that the ratio between men and women is 1.28. It went on to state that while the disease is strongly related to aging, men are affected earlier in life than women. This is likely due to heavy workload and a higher body mass index (BMI). Although spinal stenosis tends to affect men more than women, degenerative spondylolisthesis in association with spinal stenosis is more prevalent in women. Occupation, race, and smaller canal diameter also do not appear to have a correlation with the development of spinal stenosis.

Furthermore, there is now a disproportionate rise in spinal surgery being performed. The incidence in the 1980s in Sweden was 5 per 100,000 people and increased 300% between 1987 and 1999. Again in 2013, Sweden reported an incidence of 40 per 100,000 people. The large increase in surgical treatment for this disease is well known and studied. The United States has also followed similar trends.

==History==
A description of LSS was published by Sachs and Frankel in 1900, but the first clinical description of LSS is usually attributed to the Dutch neurosurgeon Henk Verbiest, whose report appeared in 1954.

Spinal stenosis began to be recognized as an impairing condition in the 1950s and 1970s. Individuals who experience back pain and other symptoms are likely to have bigger spinal canals than those who are asymptomatic. A normal-sized lumbar canal is rarely encountered in persons with either disc disease or those requiring a laminectomy.

During the 1970s and 1980s, many case reports showed successful surgical treatment rates, but these were based on subjective assessment by surgeons. In 1992, Johnsson, Rosén and Udén described the natural history of LSS, with different conclusions about prognosis and treatment: &quot;70% of patients reported no significant change in symptoms, 15% showed significant improvement, whereas 15% showed some deterioration. The investigators concluded that observation is a reasonable treatment option for lumbar stenosis and that significant neurologic deterioration is rare.&quot;

==Society and culture==

===United States===
Under rules promulgated by Titles II and XVI of the United States Social Security Act, spinal stenosis is recognized as a disabling condition under Listing 1.04 C. The listing states: &quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis resulting in neurogenic claudication, established by findings on appropriate medically acceptable imaging, manifested by chronic nonradicular pain and weakness, and resulting in inability to ambulate effectively, as defined in 1.00B2b.&quot; The regulation is written specifically for lumbar stenosis.

<doc id="658160" wikidata="Q524840" url="?curid=658160" title="Joseph Lakanal">
<text>Joseph Lakanal (14 July 1762 – 14 February 1845) was a French politician, and an original member of the &quot;Institut de France&quot;.

==Early career==
Born in Serres, in present-day Ariège, his name was originally &quot;Lacanal&quot;, and was altered to distinguish him from his Royalist brothers. He studied theology, and joined one of the teaching congregations (&quot;Pères de la Doctrine Chrétienne&quot;), and for fourteen years taught in their schools. He was professor of rhetoric at Bourges, and of philosophy at Moulins.

He was elected by his native &quot;département&quot; to the National Convention of the French Republic in 1792, where he sat until 1795; Lakanal was one of the noted administrators of the French Revolution. At the time of his election, he was acting as vicar to his uncle Bernard Font (1723–1800), the constitutional bishop of Pamiers. In the convention, he sat with The Mountain and voted for the execution of King Louis XVI.

==Projects and reforms==
Lakanal became a member of the Committee of Public Instruction early in 1793, and after carrying many useful decrees on the preservation of national monuments, on the military schools, on the reorganization of the &quot;Jardin des Plantes&quot; as the &quot;Muséum national d&#x27;Histoire naturelle&quot;, and other matters (such as the creation of the &quot;École publique des Langues Orientales vivantes&quot;), he brought forward on 26 June his &quot;Projet d&#x27;éducation nationale&quot; (printed at the Imprimerie Nationale), which proposed to lay the burden of primary education on the public funds, but to leave secondary education to private enterprise; public &quot;fêtes&quot; were also assigned specified sums, and a central commission was to be entrusted with educational questions.

The project, to which Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès also contributed, was refused by the convention, who submitted the whole question to a special Commission of six, which, under the influence of Maximilien Robespierre, adopted a report by Louis-Michel Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau (shortly before his death).

Lakanal, who was a member of the commission, now began to work for the organization of higher education, and, abandoning the principle of his &quot;Projet&quot;, advocated the establishment of state-aided schools for primary, secondary and university education. In October 1793, he was sent by the convention to the south-western &quot;départements&quot; and did not return to Paris until after the revolution of Thermidor that toppled Robespierre.

==Thermidor and Directory==
He became president of the Education Committee, and promptly abolished the system which had had Robespierre&#x27;s support. He drew up schemes for normal schools of &quot;départements&quot;, for primary schools (in accordance with his previous &quot;Projet&quot;) and central schools; Lakanal accepted resolutions against his own system, but continued his educational reforms after his election to the Council of the Five Hundred in 1795.

In 1799 he was sent by the Directory to organize the defence of the four &quot;départments&quot; on the left bank of the Rhine (in present-day Germany), threatened by the invasion of counter-Revolution forces (the Second Coalition).

==Later life and exile==
Under the Consulate and Empire, Lakanal resumed his professional work, as a professor at the Lycée Charlemagne, and after the battle of Waterloo (1815), he retired to the United States. He was welcomed there by President James Madison, and the United States Congress gave him a grant of in the Vine and Olive Colony in Alabama. He then later became a planter, therefore owning slaves, and was afterward chosen president of the &quot;University of Louisiana&quot; that he reorganized with the support of local masonic lodges, known today as Tulane University.

He returned to France in 1834, and published in 1838 an &quot;Expos sommaire des travaux de Joseph Lakanal&quot;. Shortly afterwards, in spite of his advanced age, Lakanal married a second time. He died in Paris; his widow died in 1881. Lakanal&#x27;s &quot;éloge&quot; at the Academy of Moral and Political Science, of which he was a member, was pronounced by the Comte de Rémusat (16 February 1845), and a &quot;Notice historique&quot; by François Mignet was read on 2 May 1857.

==Freemasonry==
Probably initiated at a Moulins lodge between 1786 and 1788, Lakanal was member of &quot;Le point parfait&quot; lodge in Paris from 1790. After the Revolution, he created two High Degree Chapters &quot;La Triple Harmonie&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Abeille Impériale&quot;.

<doc id="658161" wikidata="Q877541" url="?curid=658161" title="Olympic Charter">
<text>The Olympic Charter is a set of rules and guidelines for the organisation of the Olympic Games, and for governing the Olympic movement. Its last revision was on the 17th of July 2020 during the 136th IOC Session, held by video conference. Adopted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), it is the codification of the fundamental principles, rules and by-laws. French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Charter.

==Purpose==
Throughout the history of the Olympics, the Olympic Charter has often decided the outcome of Olympic controversy. As expressed in its introduction, the Olympic Charter serves three main purposes:
*to establish principles and values of Olympism
*to serve as IOC law
*to define the rights and obligations of the three main constituents of the Olympic movement: the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Federations and the National Olympic Committees.

==Main components==
With its 6 chapters and 61 articles, the Olympic Charter outlines in detail several guidelines and rules. This article highlights and summarises those items considered most important to governing the Olympic Games, the Olympic movement, and its three main constituents: the International Olympic Committee, the International Federations, and the National Olympic Committees.

===Chapter 1: The Olympic Movement and its Action===
Article 2: The mission of the IOC is to promote Olympism throughout the world
and to lead the Olympic Movement. This includes upholding ethics in sports, encouraging participation in sports, ensuring the Olympic Games take place on a regular period, protecting the Olympic Movement, and encouraging and supporting the development of sport.

Article 6: The Olympic Games are competitions between athletes in individual or team events and not between countries.
Article 8: The Olympic symbol consists of five interlocking rings which, from left to right are blue, yellow, black, green and red.

===Chapter 2: The International Olympic Committee (IOC)===
This chapter outlines the membership, meetings, and guiding doctrines of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

===Chapter 3: The International Federations (IFs)===
Chapter 3 discusses the role of International Federations (IFs) in the Olympic movement. IFs are international non-governmental organisations that administer to sports at the world level and encompass organisations administering such sports at the national level. For each sport that is part of the Olympic Games, an International Federation exists. These IFs work to ensure their sports are developed in a way that agrees with the Olympic Charter and the Olympic spirit. With technical expertise in its particular sport, an IF has control over eligibility for competition as well as details of the venue in which the athletic competition takes place.

===Chapter 4: The National Olympic Committees (NOCs)===
Article 28: The mission of the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) is to develop, promote and protect the Olympic Movement in their respective countries. The role of NOCs within each country is to promote the spirit of Olympicism, ensure the observance of the Olympic Charter, and to encourage ethics in and development of sports. They are in charge of their country&#x27;s representation at the Games, deciding on a host city for the Games, and cooperation with governmental and non-governmental bodies during the Games.

===Chapter 5: The Olympic Games===
This chapter addresses the celebration of the Olympic Games, the selection of the host city, the eligibility code for participation in the games, those sports included in the Games, media coverage, publications, and propaganda allowed for the Games.

In addition, Section 3 of this chapter discusses applicable protocol for Olympic functions and events. This includes an outline of use of the Olympic flag, flame, and opening and closing ceremonies.
The five rings of the Olympic games signify the five continents.

===Chapter 6: Measures and Sanctions, Disciplinary Procedures and Dispute Resolution ===
This chapter addresses (Measures and Sanctions, Disciplinary Procedures and Dispute Resolution)
* Rule: 59 – Measures and sanctions
* Rule : 60 – Challenging IOC decisions 
* Rule : 61 – Dispute resolution

==Fundamental Principles of Olympism==
# Olympism is a philosophy of life, exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will and mind. Blending sport with culture and education, Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy of effort, the educational value of good example, social responsibility and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.
# The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity.
# The Olympic Movement is the concerted, organised, universal and permanent action, carried out under the supreme authority of the IOC, of all individuals and entities who are inspired by the values of Olympism. It covers the five continents. It reaches its peak with the bringing together of the world&#x27;s athletes at the great sports festival, the Olympic Games. Its symbol is five interlaced rings.
# The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play.
# Recognising that sport occurs within the framework of society, sports organisations within the Olympic Movement shall have the rights and obligations of autonomy, which include freely establishing and controlling the rules of sport, determining the structure and governance of their organisations, enjoying the right of elections free from any outside influence and the responsibility for ensuring that principles of good governance be applied.
# The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Olympic Charter shall be secured without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
# Belonging to the Olympic Movement requires compliance with the Olympic Charter and recognition by the IOC.

==In the media==
The Olympic Charter is not simply a matter of unenforced policy for the Olympic Games. Throughout history, it has served as guidance for the proceedings of the Games. Below are a few of the most recent examples:

* 2011 – 2012: Human Rights Watch accused Saudi Arabia of contravening the Olympic Charter by systematically preventing women from practising sports in the country, and by not allowing Saudi women athletes to take part in the Olympic Games, thus violating the fourth, sixth and seventh fundamental principles of the Charter, which every member of the Olympic Movement is bound to. This came as Anita DeFrantz, chair of the IOC&#x27;s Women and Sports Commission, suggested that the country be barred from participating in the Olympics until it agrees to send women athletes to the Games. IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau, however, indicated that the Committee &quot;would not mandate that the Saudis have female representation in London&quot;, arguing that &quot;the IOC does not give ultimatums nor deadlines but rather believes that a lot can be achieved through dialogue&quot;.
*2012: The Lebanese judo team at the 2012 London Olympics refused to practice next to the Israeli one, and a makeshift barrier was erected to split their gym into two halves. Due to the alphabetical order of the English language, the two teams were scheduled to use the same mats at the ExCel to finalize their preparations. However, due the Lebanese constitution, the athletes would not train in view of the Israeli team, and insisted some sort of barrier be placed between them. Organisers accepted the Lebanese coach&#x27;s demand to separate the teams, erecting a barrier so that the Lebanese team would not see the Israeli athletes.

== Olympic Congress ==

The Olympic Congress is organized by the IOC. The Congress include representatives of the constituents of the Olympic Movement. The date and place of the Olympic Congress is determined by the Session. The Session also determines the duties of the president of the Congress. The Olympic Congress&#x27; participants are the members, Honorary President, honorary members and honour members of the IOC, the delegates representing the IFs and the NOCs. The representatives of the organizations recognized by the IOC may also take place at the Congress.

<text>Dingley Village is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 23 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Dingley Village recorded a population of 10,495 at the .

==History==

Dingley was the original name before being renamed to Dingley Village in 1991.

In 1856, Thomas Attenborough bought land in the area and named his house Dingley Grange, after Dingley Hall in Dingley in his native Northamptonshire, England. A farming community developed, relatively remote from either the bayside or Gippsland railway lines, moving into market gardens and poultry to supply metropolitan markets. There was no identifiable centre to the area apart from Christ Church (1873) at the corner of Centre and Old Dandenong Roads. The post office opened on 21 July 1913.

A family of five brothers – the Gartside – solved the problem of vegetable gluts by opening a cannery around 1920. The cannery employed up to 50 local people. The Gartside brothers donated land for the primary school which opened in 1925. In 1936 the Kingswood Golf Club, Dandenong, opened its new course in Dingley. A progress association was formed in 1947 and a recreation reserve acquired in 1954.

Urbanisation in Dingley began in the early 1960s. A small shopping centre, school, kindergarten, reserve and, later, Sunday markets on the reserve created a village atmosphere which resulted in the official change of name.

Two more primary schools, one Catholic, opened later, along with the Spring Park Public Golf course and nearby tennis courts complex. Near the Moorabbin Airport is an industrial zone set in a garden landscape, separated from the Dingley Village residential area by the Mornington Peninsula Freeway.

Dingley Village became part of the municipality of the City of Kingston on 15 December 1994.

It is located by the City of Kingston&#x27;s green wedge and is bordered to its south by Braeside Park.

The rock band Jet originated from the suburb.

<doc id="658177" wikidata="Q4929623" url="?curid=658177" title="Blue Peter badge">
<text>A &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge is an award for &quot;Blue Peter&quot; viewers, given by the BBC children&#x27;s television programme for those appearing on the show, or in recognition of achievement. They are awarded to children aged 5 to 15, or to adults who have been guests on the programme. Adults can also get a Gold badge if they have done something extraordinary. Approximately 22,000 are distributed annually.

The pin badges were introduced to the programme by editor Biddy Baxter in 1963, from an idea by &quot;Blue Peter&quot; producer Edward Barnes. The design, a shield containing the Blue Peter ship logo, was designed by Tony Hart. Coincidentally, Hart&#x27;s plasticine companion, Morph, was awarded one in 1981 by &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter at the time Sarah Greene. Although the original white-and-blue design remains the most common and well-known, differently coloured variations have been created for various purposes. Gold badges are the highest level of award, being reserved for exceptional achievements and former presenters.

The badge provides the wearer with free entry to many British attractions, particularly museums and exhibitions that are featured on the show although many of the attractions will only allow one badge holder for each full price paying adult. The programme producers suspended the privileges amid concerns about the badges being sold in March 2006, but they were reintroduced with additional security a few months later.

== Use by presenters ==
The presenters almost always wear their badges on the show – the only exception being when their apparel is incompatible (for example, a life jacket), in which case a sticker with the ship emblem is normally used instead. In addition, large prints or stickers of the ship are attached to vehicles driven by the presenters during filming assignments.

Sometimes new presenters first appear on the programme with no badge before it is clarified to the audience that they are a new presenter. For example, Zöe Salmon appeared on the show as a guest a week before being introduced as a presenter. Simon Groom first appeared during a filming assignment at a disco where he was a DJ and Gethin Jones made a debut appearance disguised as Santa Claus on Zoe Salmon&#x27;s first appearance.

Many presenters are awarded the more prestigious &quot;gold badge&quot; when they leave the show. When Simon Thomas left in 2005, he was awarded a gold badge on his last programme. This has since become a tradition with Liz Barker, Matt Baker, Konnie Huq, Katy Hill, Joel Defries, Andy Akinwolere, Helen Skelton, Lindsey Russell, Adam Beales and Barney Harwood also being awarded gold badges on their final show. Conversely, when Richard Bacon was fired from the show for drug use, he was required to hand back his Blue Peter badge.

Several former presenters have been awarded them when appearing as guests on the programme. Valerie Singleton was awarded a gold badge during a studio interview recorded for the 1990 video release &quot;The Best of Blue Peter, the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s&quot;. Her fellow presenters John Noakes and Peter Purves were given gold badges on the first programme in 2000 when the time capsule for the year 2000 was dug up. Peter Duncan was presented with a gold badge in February 2007, whilst appearing on the programme as a guest.

== Awards to viewers ==
&quot;Blue Peter&quot; badges are frequently given out to children who appear on the show. Additionally, viewers aged 6–15 can apply for a badge by corresponding with the show by post. Applications require a message of at least 50 words explaining why a badge is deserved and often include drawings, poems, or other creative works. There are different types of badges, representing different types of achievement.

== History of badges ==
The badge was originally introduced in 1963, featuring the blue ship logo on a white plastic shield inspired by the ship from Disney&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. This design remained unchanged until the 1990s when a revised badge featuring a raised moulding of the ship design by Tony Hart was introduced (more detailed and neater than the previous printed reproduction). This version disappeared in 1997 when the old-style badge returned.

In 2004, coinciding with the show&#x27;s September revamp, a new badge design was introduced. It is slightly larger in dimension and with a much bolder printing of the new-style traditional ship without its rigging detail (though the pre-2000 style flags remain).

In 2016, it was announced that any future Green badges awarded (see below) would be made out of recycled yoghurt pots to try to make them &#x27;greener&#x27;. The Blue and Purple badges followed suit during early 2017. These badges are slightly smaller, thinner and lighter than the badges before this change, but have the same ship design as the 2004 badge.

== Types ==
&quot;Blue Peter&quot; awards seven different types of badges, as well as, occasionally, some limited edition variants.

===Main badges===

* The Blue or White badge (a blue ship on a white shield): This is what the presenters on the show usually wear. Viewers of the programme can win one by either sending in an interesting letter, poem, picture or story, or by appearing on the programme.
* The Silver and Blue badge (a silver ship on a blue shield; not to be confused with the newer Silver badge described below): This was awarded to viewers who have already won a Blue badge, for a further achievement, until it was retired in 2022 in favour of the new Silver badge.
* The Green badge (a white ship on a green shield): This is &quot;Blue Peter&#x27;s&quot; environmental award, awarded for any correspondence from viewers with a conservation, nature or environmental theme. Presenters on the programme occasionally wear this badge instead of the blue one, as does the gardener Chris Collins, and they have been given out to those appearing on editions of the programme dedicated to environmental issues. On the Thursday 2 June 2016 show, it was announced that the Green badge would be made out of recycled material from then onwards.
* The Competition Winners, or Orange badge (a white ship on an orange shield): This is given to viewers who have been either a winner or runner up in any of &quot;Blue Peter&#x27;s&quot; many competitions. This replaced the original competition winners badge, which was a circular metal badge with the ship in the centre and the words &quot;Blue Peter Competition Winner&quot; around the outside, in 2005.
* The Fan Club, Purple, or Team Player&#x27;s badge (a white ship on a purple shield): Introduced in September 2006, this was originally awarded to 12 children a month who won the chance to spend a day working with the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; team by having ideas for the programme. It was also awarded to the &#x27;Purple Lady&#x27; visited by Gethin Jones on the show broadcast on Thursday 10 May 2007. From the September 2007 series, the team players scheme was changed and viewers are now awarded these badges when writing a review of an edition of the programme.
* The Silver badge (a silver ship on a sparkling silver shield) was launched on 14 October 2022, and was awarded for acts of kindness and supporting others. This badge was retired on 10 February 2025.
* The Book badge was introduced in 2023. It is awarded to children for showing an interest in reading. It was designed by Sir Quentin Blake in his caricature style.
* The Gold badge (a gold-plated brooch in the shape of the ship logo): This is &quot;Blue Peter&#x27;s&quot; highest award and is given for exceptional achievement, such as to people who have performed acts of extreme bravery, or represented their country in a major event. It takes the form of a gold-plated ship-shaped pin brooch. Gold badge holders include Leo Stuchbury (1993) who was awarded this badge for being the youngest ever person to complete the National Swimathon at the age of 6, David Beckham, J. K. Rowling, Stephen Payne, Queen Elizabeth II (2001), Tom Daley (2009), David Tennant (2009), Sir Lewis Hamilton (2009), Karina Bailey McNally (2009), Dani Harmer (2009), Anthony Horowitz (2011), Sir Jonathan Ive (2013), Helen Glover (2014), Peter Lord (2015), Steven Spielberg (2016), Roald Dahl (posthumously 2016), the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (2017), Ed Sheeran (2018), Madonna, Sir Peter Jackson, Sir David Attenborough, Sir Paul McCartney (2019), Captain Tom Moore (2020), Anne Wood CBE (2020), Marcus Rashford (2021), King Charles III and Queen Camilla (2023). Also, Matthew McGuinness for outstanding cricket despite living with cystic fibrosis in 2006, E Henshaw for fundraising efforts in 2013 and Emily Burrows for bravery and fundraising in 2019. Two dogs have also received the Gold badge: Bonnie in 1991 and Endal in 2003. Valerie Singleton was the first former presenter to be awarded the gold badge, being presented with it by Yvette Fielding and John Leslie during the recording of a commercial VHS home video &quot;Blue Peter – The Best Of The 1960s And 1970s&quot;, released in 1990. John Noakes and Peter Purves were awarded their gold badges during the programme broadcast in January 2000 where the presenters reunited to open the box buried for the millennium in 1971. It has become traditional to present a leaving presenter with a gold badge on their final show, firstly with Simon Thomas, (see Use by presenters, above). Former editors of the programme; Biddy Baxter and Lewis Bronze were both given the badge live on their last shows, whilst Richard Marson was awarded one after his last programme by Baxter. Janet Ellis was awarded her gold badge in November 2017 on BBC’s breakfast news by presenter Radzi Chingyanganya.

===Limited edition badges===
As well as the badges listed above, some types of badges have been produced as limited editions for various occasions:
* A 25th birthday badge, introduced in October 1983.
* A 30th birthday badge, introduced in October 1988.
* A 35th birthday badge, introduced in October 1993.
* A badge to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the launch of the original badge in 1963, introduced in October 2003. This moulding was made of rubber and larger than the traditional badge; it consisted of a white shield with a raised &#x27;bubble ship&#x27; applique.
* A 50th birthday badge, introduced in October 2008. This was a gold shield with a blue ship, with the digits &quot;50&quot; superimposed. It was awarded to viewers who sent in something to the programme which celebrated the 50th birthday. However this badge was not announced on the programme itself.
* The Factbyte Factory badge (a shield containing a hologram which oscillates between the Blue Peter logo and a &quot;factbyte&quot; logo): was introduced in early 2009, this badge was awarded to those achieving VIP Level 7 in the online &quot;Factbyte Factory&quot; game. This is achieved by collecting &quot;factbytes&quot; (interesting facts and information represented by a gold circle containing an &quot;f&quot;) from the programmes and the website. This was a limited edition badge and ended after the close of the 2009 series.
* The Sport Badge was introduced for a limited time in 2013 to try to get more children to participate in a sport (from the months of July to September – a child&#x27;s usual summer holiday.) The badge is shield-shaped and made from the same material as the common Blue badge. It is a white badge with a medal shape on the front of it (the round-shaped medal which is blue, but has the white Blue Peter ship on it. The ribbon &#x27;attached&#x27; to the medal is made from stripes of blue, white and red.) The child could earn the badge by introducing someone to a new sport, maybe a friend or a brother or sister. Children could apply for the sport badge during the summer months of every year since, with slight changes in the badge&#x27;s design. The 2014 and 2015 badge had borders added to the design, which were blue and red respectively. To celebrate the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, a competition was launched to design the 2016 sport badge. The sports badge was also awarded in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The 2021/22 Sport badge was designed by skateboarder Sky Brown; it features a wave design, and the raised motto &quot;The sky is the limit&quot; in a ring around the ship logo.
* The Music badge, designed by Ed Sheeran, was launched for BBC Music Day in 2019; it has a black ship on a multi-coloured shield featuring musical instruments and other motifs 
* The Diamond badge, given out in 2018 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Blue Peter and given to viewers who had already received a blue badge.
* The Doctor Who badge, given out in 2023 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and was given to the top 500 competition entries for the Blue Peter Doctor Who Competition.

=== Other awards ===
As well as the badges, an &quot;Outstanding Endeavour&quot; award was introduced to the show in 1978. It is circular, made from brass, and bears the show&#x27;s ship logo. It was presented to the programme on its 20th-anniversary show by original presenter Christopher Trace. Trace was working at a factory at the time and his colleagues made the award to be presented to a viewer who had achieved some remarkable endeavour, such as saving a life or overcoming a particular adversity. Trace had not informed the production team ahead of the live broadcast he was planning on introducing the award on the programme. Initially it was presented annually on the show&#x27;s October birthday edition, being given to, amongst others, pop group Musical Youth in 1982 and trampoline champion Andrea Holmes in 1983, who received the award from Trace himself on the 25th-anniversary show. 11-years-old lifesaver Martin Pout won the award in 1984 followed by Bob Geldof in 1985. Don Allum took the award in 1987 and teenagers Simon Marsh and Anthony Walters were recognised in 1988 for saving a school bus from disaster, being given their award by Valerie Singleton on the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary edition. In 1989 the show honoured the boys of Emanuel School who had assisted the victims of the Clapham Junction rail crash on 12 December 1988 This was the last time the award was presented.

== Badges for sale ==
In March 2006, the news that &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badges were available for sale on auction websites such as eBay attracted a great deal of media interest, with the suspicion that the right to free entry was being abused. In a leader article &quot;The Times&quot; described the news as &quot;a knife to the national psyche&quot;, while &quot;The Sun&quot; launched a campaign in which readers could &quot;send in the names of people they know who have an illegal &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge&quot;.

After news of the sales reached a wide audience, the number of badges for sale on eBay exploded from a few dozen to 300. eBay said that it would remove any auctions proven to involve fake badges on the grounds of copyright infringement, but that trade in real badges was not illegal and would not be halted by eBay administrators.

On 29 March 2006, the decision was made to withdraw the privileges the badges offered until measures could be put in place to stop the badges being sold for commercial gain, with the show appealing to the public for ideas. Accompanying the statement of suspensions the show&#x27;s editor Richard Marson said &quot;Blue Peter&quot; wished to &quot;protect children who have earned their badges and who are feeling very let down by this cynical trade.&quot;

&quot;Blue Peter&quot; badges were re-introduced on 19 June 2006, under a new system in which all current holders of a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge and those who win a badge will also need to be issued with a photo ID card. The idea was thought up by 11-year-old &quot;Blue Peter&quot; viewer and Blue badge winner Helen Jennings, who even included a prototype design of the ID card in the letter that she sent to the show. The producers awarded Jennings a Silver badge for proposing the system. ID cards for previous badge winners aged 6 to 15 can be obtained by entering details into a form on the Blue Peter website.

<doc id="658183" wikidata="Q1649571" url="?curid=658183" title="Industrial process control">
<text>Industrial process control (IPC) or simply process control is a system used in modern manufacturing which uses the principles of control theory and physical industrial control systems to monitor, control and optimize continuous industrial production processes using control algorithms. This ensures that the industrial machines run smoothly and safely in factories and efficiently use energy to transform raw materials into high-quality finished products with reliable consistency while reducing energy waste and economic costs, something which could not be achieved purely by human manual control. State-Based Control is among a spectrum of automation styles within ISA106, Procedure Automation for Continuous Process Operation. Industrial process control can be incorporated into State-Based Control to achieve operational excellence through higher levels of automated operating discipline. 
In IPC, control theory provides the theoretical framework to understand system dynamics, predict outcomes and design control strategies to ensure predetermined objectives, utilizing concepts like feedback loops, stability analysis and controller design. On the other hand, the physical apparatus of IPC, based on automation technologies, consists of several components. Firstly, a network of sensors continuously measure various process variables (such as temperature, pressure, etc.) and product quality variables. A programmable logic controller (PLC, for smaller, less complex processes) or a distributed control system (DCS, for large-scale or geographically dispersed processes) analyzes this sensor data transmitted to it, compares it to predefined setpoints using a set of instructions or a mathematical model called the control algorithm and then, in case of any deviation from these setpoints (e.g., temperature exceeding setpoint), makes quick corrective adjustments through actuators such as valves (e.g. cooling valve for temperature control), motors or heaters to guide the process back to the desired operational range. This creates a continuous closed-loop cycle of measurement, comparison, control action, and re-evaluation which guarantees that the process remains within established parameters. The HMI (Human-Machine Interface) acts as the &quot;control panel&quot; for the IPC system where small number of human operators can monitor the process and make informed decisions regarding adjustments. IPCs can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel (controlled environment tank for mixing, separating, reacting, or storing materials in industrial processes.) to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand control feedback loops. 
IPC provides several critical benefits to manufacturing companies. By maintaining a tight control over key process variables, it helps reduce energy use, minimize waste and shorten downtime for peak efficiency and reduced costs. It ensures consistent and improved product quality with little variability, which satisfies the customers and strengthens the company&#x27;s reputation. It improves safety by detecting and alerting human operators about potential issues early, thus preventing accidents, equipment failures, process disruptions and costly downtime. Analyzing trends and behaviors in the vast amounts of data collected real-time helps engineers identify areas of improvement, refine control strategies and continuously enhance production efficiency using a data-driven approach.
IPC is used across a wide range of industries where precise control is important. The applications can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel, to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand control loops. In automotive manufacturing, IPC ensures consistent quality by meticulously controlling processes like welding and painting. Mining operations are optimized with IPC monitoring ore crushing and adjusting conveyor belt speeds for maximum output. Dredging benefits from precise control of suction pressure, dredging depth and sediment discharge rate by IPC, ensuring efficient and sustainable practices. Pulp and paper production leverages IPC to regulate chemical processes (e.g., pH and bleach concentration) and automate paper machine operations to control paper sheet moisture content and drying temperature for consistent quality. In chemical plants, it ensures the safe and efficient production of chemicals by controlling temperature, pressure and reaction rates. Oil refineries use it to smoothly convert crude oil into gasoline and other petroleum products. In power plants, it helps maintain stable operating conditions necessary for a continuous electricity supply. In food and beverage production, it helps ensure consistent texture, safety and quality. Pharmaceutical companies relies on it to produce life-saving drugs safely and effectively. The development of large industrial process control systems has been instrumental in enabling the design of large high volume and complex processes, which could not be otherwise economically or safely operated.
Historical milestones in the development of industrial process control began in ancient civilizations, where water level control devices were used to regulate water flow for irrigation and water clocks. During the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, there was a growing need for precise control over boiler pressure in steam engines. In the 1930s, pneumatic and electronic controllers, such as PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers, were breakthrough innovations that laid the groundwork for modern control theory. The late 20th century saw the rise of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and distributed control systems (DCS), while the advent of microprocessors further revolutionized IPC by enabling more complex control algorithms.

==History==
Early process control breakthroughs came most frequently in the form of water control devices. Ktesibios of Alexandria is credited for inventing float valves to regulate water level of water clocks in the 3rd century BC. In the 1st century AD, Heron of Alexandria invented a water valve similar to the fill valve used in modern toilets.

Later process controls inventions involved basic physics principles. In 1620, Cornelis Drebbel invented a bimetallic thermostat for controlling the temperature in a furnace. In 1681, Denis Papin discovered the pressure inside a vessel could be regulated by placing weights on top of the vessel lid. In 1745, Edmund Lee created the fantail to improve windmill efficiency; a fantail was a smaller windmill placed 90° of the larger fans to keep the face of the windmill pointed directly into the oncoming wind.

With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the 1760s, process controls inventions were aimed to replace human operators with mechanized processes. In 1784, Oliver Evans created a water-powered flourmill which operated using buckets and screw conveyors. Henry Ford applied the same theory in 1910 when the assembly line was created to decrease human intervention in the automobile production process.

For continuously variable process control it was not until 1922 that a formal control law for what we now call PID control or three-term control was first developed using theoretical analysis, by Russian American engineer Nicolas Minorsky. Minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the US Navy and based his analysis on observations of a helmsman. He noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error, but also on past error, as well as the current rate of change; this was then given a mathematical treatment by Minorsky.
His goal was stability, not general control, which simplified the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to steady-state error), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term was added to improve stability and control.

==Development of modern process control operations==

Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-staffed central control room. Effectively this was the centralization of all the localized panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process.

With the coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around the plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control system (DCS) was born.

The introduction of DCSs allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

==Hierarchy==

The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels in a large process using processor and computer-based control.

Referring to the diagram: Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors (process value readings - PV), and final control elements (FCE), such as control valves; Level 1 contains the industrialized Input/Output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors; Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which collate information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens; Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets; Level 4 is the production scheduling level.

==Control model==
To determine the fundamental model for any process, the inputs and outputs of the system are defined differently than for other chemical processes. The balance equations are defined by the control inputs and outputs rather than the material inputs. The control model is a set of equations used to predict the behavior of a system and can help determine what the response to change will be. The state variable (x) is a measurable variable that is a good indicator of the state of the system, such as temperature (energy balance), volume (mass balance) or concentration (component balance). Input variable (u) is a specified variable that commonly include flow rates.

The entering and exiting flows are both considered control inputs. The control input can be classified as a manipulated, disturbance, or unmonitored variable. Parameters (p) are usually a physical limitation and something that is fixed for the system, such as the vessel volume or the viscosity of the material. Output (y) is the metric used to determine the behavior of the system. The control output can be classified as measured, unmeasured, or unmonitored.

==Types==
Processes can be characterized as batch, continuous, or hybrid. Batch applications require that specific quantities of raw materials be combined in specific ways for particular duration to produce an intermediate or end result. One example is the production of adhesives and glues, which normally require the mixing of raw materials in a heated vessel for a period of time to form a quantity of end product. Other important examples are the production of food, beverages and medicine. Batch processes are generally used to produce a relatively low to intermediate quantity of product per year (a few pounds to millions of pounds).

A continuous physical system is represented through variables that are smooth and uninterrupted in time. The control of the water temperature in a heating jacket, for example, is an example of continuous process control. Some important continuous processes are the production of fuels, chemicals and plastics. Continuous processes in manufacturing are used to produce very large quantities of product per year (millions to billions of pounds). Such controls use feedback such as in the PID controller A PID Controller includes proportional, integrating, and derivative controller functions.

Applications having elements of batch and continuous process control are often called hybrid applications.

==Control loops==

The fundamental building block of any industrial control system is the control loop, which controls just one process variable. An example is shown in the accompanying diagram, where the flow rate in a pipe is controlled by a PID controller, assisted by what is effectively a cascaded loop in the form of a valve servo-controller to ensure correct valve positioning.

Some large systems may have several hundreds or thousands of control loops. In complex processes the loops are interactive, so that the operation of one loop may affect the operation of another. The system diagram for representing control loops is a Piping and instrumentation diagram.

Commonly used control systems include programmable logic controller (PLC), Distributed Control System (DCS) or SCADA.

A further example is shown. If a control valve were used to hold level in a tank, the level controller would compare the equivalent reading of a level sensor to the level setpoint and determine whether more or less valve opening was necessary to keep the level constant. A cascaded flow controller could then calculate the change in the valve position.

==Economic advantages==
The economic nature of many products manufactured in batch and continuous processes require highly efficient operation due to thin margins. The competing factor in process control is that products must meet certain specifications in order to be satisfactory. These specifications can come in two forms: a minimum and maximum for a property of the material or product, or a range within which the property must be. All loops are susceptible to disturbances and therefore a buffer must be used on process set points to ensure disturbances do not cause the material or product to go out of specifications. This buffer comes at an economic cost (i.e. additional processing, maintaining elevated or depressed process conditions, etc.).

Process efficiency can be enhanced by reducing the margins necessary to ensure product specifications are met. This can be done by improving the control of the process to minimize the effect of disturbances on the process. The efficiency is improved in a two step method of narrowing the variance and shifting the target. Margins can be narrowed through various process upgrades (i.e. equipment upgrades, enhanced control methods, etc.). Once margins are narrowed, an economic analysis can be done on the process to determine how the set point target is to be shifted. Less conservative process set points lead to increased economic efficiency. Effective process control strategies increase the competitive advantage of manufacturers who employ them.

<text>Samuel John Atlee (1739 – November 25, 1786) was an American soldier and statesman from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress for the Province of Pennsylvania from 1778 to 1782.

==Early life==
Samuel was born in Trenton, New Jersey, but his family moved to Lancaster before he was seven. He was educated at home, and began the study of law. But his studies were interrupted by the French and Indian War.

==Military career==
In 1756 he joined the Lancaster company and was commissioned as an ensign. He served on the Forbes Expedition to Fort Duquesne in 1758, and by 1759 he was a captain.

In 1776, Pennsylvania began raising new units for the Continental Army, and on March 21, 1776, Atlee was named Colonel of a unit, the &quot;Pennsylvania Musketry Battalion&quot;. Once they were organized, he led them north to the defense of New York City. During the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776, he led the original defense of the &quot;Old Stone House&quot; in Brooklyn, New York. The house was situated on high ground and covered the American withdrawal. Atlee&#x27;s force was driven from the house, but General William Alexander (American general) came to support him. The Americans twice recaptured the house. The defenders directly engaged three British regiments, led by General Cornwallis. They held out until noon, allowing most of the Continental forces in Brooklyn to successfully withdraw to the Brooklyn Heights. At last, surrounded and cut off by the Hessians, General Alexander surrendered in the early afternoon. While watching this action from fortifications to the north on Brooklyn Heights, General Washington remarked, &quot;Good God, what brave men must I lose this day!&quot; Samuel Atlee remained a prisoner of war until he was exchanged in October 1778.

==Political career==
When Atlee returned home, the Pennsylvania General Assembly named him as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He served there until 1782. In 1782, Lancaster County sent Atlee to the Pennsylvania Assembly. In 1783, he became a charter member in the Pennsylvania branch of the Society of the Cincinnati, and was named the County executive for Lancaster County. In 1784, he served on the commission negotiating Indian treaties that acquired most of the remaining Native American lands in Pennsylvania.

Atlee was returned to the state assembly in 1785 and 1786. He died on November 25, 1786, while attending a meeting of the legislature in Philadelphia, and is buried in the Christ Church Burial Ground there.

The reconstructed &quot;Old Stone House&quot; that he defended in the battle of Brooklyn located at the corner of Fourth Avenue and Third Street, it was moved a few feet during its reconstruction and is at a higher grade level. It is in Byrne Park, and is open to the public on a limited basis.

<text>Arthur&#x27;s Pass is a mountain pass in the Southern Alps of the South Island of New Zealand. The pass sits above sea level and marks part of the boundary between the West Coast and Canterbury regions. Located 140 km from Christchurch and 95 km from Greymouth, the pass comprises part of a saddle between the valleys of the Ōtira River (a tributary of the Taramakau River in the west) and of the Bealey River (in the east). Arthur&#x27;s Pass lies on the border of the Selwyn and Westland districts.

A township of the same name ([[Arthur&#x27;s Pass]]) lies about 5 km south of the mountain pass. The pass is named after Arthur Dudley Dobson and a memorial at the pass commemorates him.

==History==
For hundreds of years Māori had crossed the Southern Alps by every pass free of snow in the summer months. The reason for making this difficult journey was greenstone (&quot;pounamu&quot;), highly prized both for its hardness and beauty and found only on the West Coast of the South Island. By the time Europeans arrived, the only pass in regular use was the one now known as Harper Pass, north of Arthur&#x27;s Pass. When Leonard Harper was led in 1857 by Māori guides across the pass which now bears his name, Tarapuhi, chief at the Māori settlement of Māwhera (now Greymouth), told him about a route across the mountains at the head of the Ōtira River that had not been used in living memory. Bad weather prevented Harper from exploring it on his return journey.

In 1860 writer and explorer Samuel Butler had seen a pass at the head of the Bealey Valley, but was travelling alone and did not want to leave his horse unattended so &quot;shirked investigation&quot;.

In 1864 Arthur Dudley Dobson (1841–1934) along with his brother Edward were the first Europeans to cross the pass. In 1863 Dobson went to the mostly unexplored West Coast for seven months of survey work. His area of work extended from the Grey River to Abut Head, and inland up to the Main Divide. His brother Edward, meanwhile, was clearing a rough track over Harper Pass. Arthur Dobson returned to Christchurch and reported his findings to the chief surveyor, Thomas Cass.
Cass then commissioned Arthur Dobson in 1864 to find out whether there was a suitable pass from the Waimakariri watershed to the West Coast. George and Arthur Dobson set out in March 1864, later to be joined by their brother Edward at Craigieburn. While George surveyed road lines there, Edward and Arthur proceeded to explore the high country. On 13 March 1864 they found the pass mentioned by Tarapuhi to Harper, which steeply descended to what became known as Otira. They explored the gorge as far as the junction of the Rolleston River, but saw no good sheep country so retraced their steps. Arthur prepared a report, which included a sketch of the pass which he described as the &quot;Arahura Saddle&quot;, thinking it led to the Arahura River, and presented it to Cass.

Soon after, the discovery of gold triggered the West Coast gold rush. The provincial engineer, their father Edward Dobson, was commissioned to examine every possible pass to the West Coast from the watersheds of the Waimakariri, Taramakau and Hurunui Rivers. After finishing his examination, he declared that &quot;Arthur&#x27;s pass&quot; was by far the most suitable to get to the gold fields. The provincial government decided that a road was to be built between Christchurch and Hokitika, a distance of , and Edward Dobson was put in charge of the project. The road was opened on 20 March 1866. The alpine pass became known as Arthur&#x27;s Pass, with a nearby village and a later a national park also taking this name. Arthur Dobson had a long and distinguished career, was knighted in 1931, and after his death in 1934, calls for a memorial came up. The Arthur Dudley Dobson memorial, a stone column of in height, was unveiled in April 1937 at the alpine pass that bears his name.

==Road link==
State Highway 73 passes over Arthur&#x27;s Pass and is the highest of only three roads crossing the Southern Alps, the other crossings being the Haast Pass and the Lewis Pass. However, Porters Pass, on the same road, is higher (at 939 m) than Arthur&#x27;s Pass, but it is not considered one of the alpine passes, as it is located in the Canterbury foothills not far away from Springfield.

Previously prone to be blocked by landslides or avalanches, the road on the western side of the pass has seen extensive civil engineering work in the late 1990s. Most notably, the impressive Otira Viaduct, near the settlement of Otira and spanning 440 metres of unstable terrain, was completed in 1999.

==Rail link==
The Midland Line, connecting Christchurch and the West Coast, crosses the Main Divide by means of the Otira Tunnel, between Arthur&#x27;s Pass township and Otira. When opened in 1923, the tunnel was the longest in the British Empire.

<doc id="658193" wikidata="Q16201200" url="?curid=658193" title="Initial reaction force">
<text>An initial reaction force (IRF), also known as an internal reaction force, or extreme reaction force (ERF) to inmates, is a type of small-scale riot squad in U.S. military prisons such as the Camp Delta detention center of Guantanamo Bay.
A squad is suited up and ready to respond, at all times, in instances when one or more detainees are combative or resistive.

==Controversy==

It is alleged by detainees that the units also act as a punishment squad for detainees whose level of insubordination does not fit the criteria for IRF deployment. Part of the allegations charge that regular guards will create reasons to call on the IRF to brutalize detainees over petty or non-existent infractions; refusing to agree to the third cell search in a day or infractions as slight as placing their toiletries on their shelf in the wrong order.
claims: &quot;16. I have witnessed the activities of the Internal Reaction Force (hereinafter &quot;IRF&quot;), which consists of a squad of soldiers that enter a detainee&#x27;s cell and brutalize him with the aid of an attack dog. The IRF invasions were so common that the term to be &quot;IRF&#x27;d&quot; became part of the language of the detainees. I have seen detainees suffer serious injuries as a result of being IRF&#x27;ed. I have seen detainees IRF&#x27;ed while they were praying, or for refusing medication.&quot;

Another allegation by ex-detainees is that while the IRF squad is en route to the target detainee&#x27;s cell they will chant, &quot;IRF! IRF! IRF!&quot; in order to intimidate and terrify the detainee. Part of the allegation claims that, when the squad arrives at a detainee&#x27;s cell, they shout out demands to comply.

In his first interview, after his repatriation, Tarek Dergoul asserted that a sixth member of the ERF team always stood outside the cell, with a video camera, recording the action.
Camp authorities confirmed every ERF action was filmed, and Senator Patrick Leahy called for the recordings to be made available to the Senate Judiciary Committee, to see if they contained instances of the kind of abuse recorded in the Abu Ghraib trophy photos.
Camp Commandant Jay Hood appeared before the committee two months later with a selection of recordings of the use of the ERF squad.

<doc id="658196" wikidata="Q2073982" url="?curid=658196" title="Cordotomy">
<text>Cordotomy (or chordotomy) is a surgical procedure that disables selected pain-conducting tracts in the spinal cord, in order to achieve loss of pain and temperature perception. This procedure is commonly performed on patients experiencing severe pain due to cancer or other incurable diseases. Anterolateral cordotomy is effective for relieving unilateral, somatic pain while bilateral cordotomies may be required for visceral or bilateral pain.

==Indications==

Cordotomy is performed as for patients with severe intractable pain, usually but not always due to cancer. Being irreversible and relatively invasive, cordotomy is used exclusively for pain where treatment to level 3 of the World Health Organization pain ladder (i.e., use of major opiates such as morphine) has proved inadequate. Cordotomy is especially indicated for pain due to asbestos-related cancers such as pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma.

==Procedure==

Most cordotomies are now performed percutaneously with fluoroscopic or CT guidance while the patient is awake under local anesthesia. The spinothalamic tract is normally divided at the level C1-C2.

Open cordotomy, which requires a laminectomy (removal of part of one or more vertebrae), takes place under general anaesthetic and has a longer recovery time and a higher risk of side-effects including permanent weakness. However, it is still sometimes used where percutaneous cordotomy is unfeasible, especially in children or other patients who are unable to co-operate. In open cordotomy, a thoracic approach is normally used so that the spinal cord tracts controlling the breathing muscles are not put at risk.

==Adverse effects==

Cordotomy can be highly effective in relieving pain, but there are significant side effects. These include dysesthesia (abnormal sensation), urinary retention and (for bilateral cervical cordotomy) apnea during sleep (acquired central hypoventilation syndrome) caused by inadvertent division of the reticulospinal tracts.

==History==

Cordotomy was first performed in 1912 by the American Neurosurgeons, William Gibson Spiller (1863–1940) and Edward Martin (1859–1938). Due to the surgical risks, it remained a rare procedure until the percutaneous technique was developed in 1965. During the 1990s the procedure became less widely used, partly because medical pain-control options had improved, and partly due to concern about side-effects. Nevertheless, it is still considered an effective treatment for severe pain.

==Alternative surgical procedures for pain==

A number of alternative surgical procedures have evolved in the 20th century. These include:

Commissural myelotomy, for bilateral pain arising from pelvic or abdominal malignancies 

Punctate or limited midline myelotomy for pelvic and abdominal visceral pain,

Other options for medically intractable pain which do not involve open surgery include implantation of an intrathecal pump (a syringe driver delivering medication into the space around the spinal cord) administering local anaesthetics and/or opiates

<text>The order Cyatheales, which includes most tree ferns, is a taxonomic order of the fern class, Polypodiopsida. No clear morphological features characterize all of the Cyatheales, but DNA sequence data indicate the order is monophyletic. Some species in the Cyatheales have tree-like growth forms from a vertical rhizome, others have shorter or horizontal expanding rhizomes.

Some species have scales on the stems and leaves, while others have hairs. However, most plants in the Cyatheales are tree ferns and have trunk-like stems up to tall. It is unclear how many times the tree form has evolved and been lost in the order.

==Description==
While the Cyatheales have been shown to be monophyletic through molecular analysis, no prominent morphological characteristics are common to the entire group. Though loosely referred to as &quot;tree ferns&quot;, most but not all members of the order possess the characteristic tree fern morphology: the rhizome is massive, woody, and rather than creeping horizontally below or on the ground, it stands erect and above ground, like a tree trunk, bearing a crown of fronds. This habit is most evident in families Dicksoniaceae and Cyatheaceae. Outside of the Cyatheales, a few ferns in other groups could be considered tree ferns, such as several ferns (&quot;Leptopteris&quot; and &quot;Todea&quot;) in the family Osmundaceae that can achieve short trunks under tall. A few species in the genera &quot;Blechnum and Sadleria&quot; could also be considered tree ferns in a liberal interpretation of the term.

Like all ferns, tree ferns reproduce by means of spores developed in sporangia on the undersides of the fronds.

The fronds of tree ferns are usually very large and multiple-pinnated, but at least one type has entire (undivided) fronds. The fronds of tree ferns also exhibit circinate vernation, meaning the young fronds emerge in coils that uncurl as they grow.

Unlike flowering plants, tree ferns do not form new woody tissue in their trunk as they grow. Rather, the trunk is supported by a fibrous mass of roots that expands as the tree fern grows.

Some genera — for example &quot;Dicksonia&quot; and &quot;Cibotium&quot;, and some &quot;Cyathea&quot; — can be transplanted by severing the top portion from the rest of the trunk and replanting it. If the transplanted top part is kept moist it will regrow a new root system over the next year. The success rate of transplantation increases if the roots are dug up intact. If the crown of the Tasmanian tree fern &quot;Dicksonia antarctica&quot; (the most common species in gardens) is damaged, it will die because all new growth occurs there. But other clump-forming tree fern species, such as &quot;D. squarrosa&quot; and &quot;D. youngiae&quot;, can regenerate from basal offsets or from &quot;pups&quot; emerging along the surviving trunk length. Tree ferns often fall over in the wild, yet manage to reroot from this new prostrate position and begin new vertical growth.

The number of tree fern species is likely to be around a thousand. Although new species are discovered in New Guinea with each botanical survey, many species throughout its range have become extinct in the last century as forest habitats have come under pressure from human activities.

==Taxonomy==
In the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, the Cyatheales were placed in the leptosporangiate ferns, class Polypodiopsida. Eight families, Thyrsopteridaceae, Loxsomataceae, Culcitaceae, Plagiogyriaceae, Cibotiaceae, Cyatheaceae, Dicksoniaceae, and Metaxyaceae, were recognized. The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al. (2011), intended for compatibility with the classification of Chase and Reveal (2009) which placed all land plants in Equisetopsida, reclassified Smith&#x27;s Polypodiopsida as subclass Polypodiidae and placed the Cyatheales there. The circumscription of the order and its families was not changed. The classification of Christenhusz and Chase (2014) placed all members of the Cyatheales in a more broadly defined Cyatheaeaceae, reducing the eight existing families to subfamilies as Thyrsopteridoideae, Loxsomatoideae, Culcitoideae, Plagiogyrioideae, Cibotioideae, Cyatheoideae, Dicksonioideae, and Metaxyoideae. The PPG I classification (2016) returned to the eight-family definition of the order., but this is not yet accepted by the general botanical community.

Historically, the Plagiogyriaceae were considered the single member of order Plagiogyriales, thought to be more closely related to Osmundales than to the tree ferns, but this hypothesis has been disproven by molecular phylogenetics.

==Distribution and habitat==
Tree ferns are found growing in tropical and subtropical areas, as well as temperate rainforests in South Africa, Australia, Spain, Portugal, New Zealand, and other island groups nearby; a few genera extend further, such as &quot;Culcita&quot; in southern Europe.

While many ferns are able to achieve a widespread distribution because of their spore reproduction, tree fern species tend to be very local. This makes their species much more susceptible to the effects of local deforestation. Why species are not more widespread is unknown, especially considering they have sufficient height to have a greater chance of getting spores into the wind stream.

==Conservation==
Where feral pigs are a problem, as in some Hawaiian rainforests, they will knock over tree ferns to root out the starchy pith, killing the plant.
