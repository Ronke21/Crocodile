<doc id="649633" wikidata="Q2141879" url="?curid=649633" title="Uranium City">
<text>Uranium City is a northern settlement in Saskatchewan, Canada. Located on the northern shores of Lake Athabasca near the border of the Northwest Territories, it is above sea level. The settlement is northwest of Prince Albert, northeast of Edmonton and south of the Northwest Territories-Saskatchewan boundary. For census purposes, it is located within the province&#x27;s Division No. 18 territory.

== History ==
In 1949, athabascaite was discovered by S. Kaiman while he was researching radioactive materials around Lake Athabasca near Uranium City.

In 1952, the provincial government decided to establish a community to service the mines in the Beaverlodge uranium area developed by Eldorado Mining and Refining, a federal crown corporation. In 1954, the local newspaper, &quot;The Uranium Times&quot;, noted that 52 mines were operating and 12 open-pit mines were next to Beaverlodge Lake. Initially, most of the residences in Uranium City were simply tents.

Some of the mines operating in the area included the Gunnar Mine, the Lorado Mine, and the Fay-Ace-Verna Mine in Eldorado, Saskatchewan.

Two options were considered for communities in the region: small communities near the mine site or larger more centralized communities with adequate services. Not wanting to replicate some of the problems associated with small mining towns at the time in Northern Ontario, the government pushed for the second option and modelled Uranium City after the community of Arvida, Quebec. In 1956, the provincial government passed the &quot;Municipal Corporation of Uranium City and District Act&quot;, creating a unique, chartered &quot;district&quot; with authority over education, health, and welfare.

The population of Uranium City started to grow significantly only once Eldorado Resources made a deliberate initiative in 1960 to see staff housed in Uranium City instead of the Eldorado campsite.

After reaching a population of 2,507 in 1981, the closure of the mines in 1982 led to economic collapse, with most residents of the community leaving. The &quot;Uranium City Act&quot; was repealed on 1 October 1983, reducing the community to an unincorporated &quot;northern settlement&quot;. The local hospital closed in the spring of 2003. Its population in 2016 was 73, including a number of Métis and First Nations people. The town is considered a uranium boomtown due to the rapid increase in population during the mining period and substantial depopulation that followed.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Uranium City had a population of 91 living in 41 of its 59 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 73. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Transportation ==
The community has a certified airport, Uranium City Airport, that features a treated gravel runway of operated by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure. The airport is one of the few employers left in the community. West Wind Aviation previously served Uranium City with flights to Prince Albert and Saskatoon three times a week. Norcanair served the community with scheduled flights until it ceased operations in 2005. Transwest Air also provided a route with Saskatoon and Regina until that company cancelled its service in November 2008. It now serves Uranium City with a flight from Saskatoon that stops in Prince Albert, Points North and Stony Rapids. There is also a small water aerodrome located next to Uranium City.

There is no normal road access connecting Uranium City with the rest of Canada. There is provision for a winter road which connects with Fond-du-Lac. Saskatchewan Highway 962 provides travel for a short distance within the local area. A significant bridge replacement project on Highway 962 was conducted in 2001 at the Fredette River.

== Communications ==

Local telephone service is provided by SaskTel and was first available in Uranium City on 30 November 1955. Current telephone numbers for international calling are of the form +1 306 498 xxxx (NPA-NXX: 306–498, CLLI: URCYSK05DS0).

Canada Post continues to deliver mail to the community. The post office is located at the municipal office (Postal Code: S0J 2W0).

Radio broadcasting in the community is provided by:
* 97.9 FM – VF2142 – rebroadcasts CKRW-FM
* 99.9 or 101.1 FM – Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation
* 103.1 FM – VF2240 – rebroadcasts CFMI-FM
* 105.1 FM – CBDH-FM, CBC Radio One, rebroadcasting CBKA-FM La Ronge.

Until 2012, television service was provided by CBKAT operating on channel 8 at a power of 15 watts. This was a rebroadcast of CBC Television service from CBKST Saskatoon. Until 2003, the local transmitter&#x27;s television programming originated from CBC North. This repeater was one of 620 analog television signals nationwide shut down by the CBC on 31 July 2012 due to budget cuts.

== Climate ==
Uranium City is part of the Taiga Shield Ecozone and experiences a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with long, cold, snowy winters, brief transitional periods, and short, cool, and humid summers. The temperature range is typically large due to frigidly cold winter temperatures that often plunge below . The highest temperature ever recorded in the settlement was on 30 June 2021 during the 2021 Western North America heat wave. Wind chill factors are prominent as well in the winter months, making the cold temperatures seem to be much colder than they actually are. Uranium City has recorded one of the coldest wind chill factors of any Canadian location, with wind chill reading being recorded on 28 January 2002. Additionally, an average of 34 days a year record wind chill readings below . The lowest temperature ever recorded in the settlement was on 15 January 1974 and on 7 February 2021.

== Education ==
Education in Uranium City is under the authority of the Northern Lights School Division #113, a school district that covers most of northern Saskatchewan. The only remaining school in Uranium City is Ben McIntyre School, serving classes from kindergarten to Grade 9. The school opened in 1977 and is named after the first teacher in Uranium City who established the first school in the community in 1952 with 40 students in ten grades. As of September 2005, 10 students were enrolled.

Secondary education was provided by CANDU High School, named after a nuclear reactor. According to travellers Vincent Chan and Tricia Holopina who visited the city in 2002, locals state that the school was opened in 1979 and closed in 1983 after only three years of service, with the building since sustaining extensive vandalism.

== Notable people ==

* Bert Burry, pilot and ice hockey player
* Gina Kingsbury, member of gold medal-winning Canadian women&#x27;s ice hockey team at the 2006 Winter Olympics

<doc id="649634" wikidata="Q1116374" url="?curid=649634" title="Pinus longaeva">
<text>Pinus longaeva (commonly referred to as the Great Basin bristlecone pine, intermountain bristlecone pine, or western bristlecone pine) is a long-living species of bristlecone pine tree found in the higher mountains of California, Nevada, and Utah. Methuselah is a Great Basin bristlecone pine that is years old and has been credited as the oldest known living non-clonal organism on Earth. To protect it, the exact location of this tree is kept secret. In 1987, the bristlecone pine was designated one of Nevada&#x27;s state trees.

==Description==
It is a medium-size tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to . The bark is bright orange-yellow, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The needles are in fascicles of five, stout, long, deep green to blue-green on the outer face, with stomata confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces. The leaves show the longest persistence of any plant, with some remaining green for 45 years (Ewers &amp; Schmid 1981).

The cones are ovoid-cylindrical, long and broad when closed, green or purple at first, ripening orange-buff when 16 months old, with numerous thin, fragile scales, each scale with a bristle-like spine long. The cones open to broad when mature, releasing the seeds immediately after opening. The seeds are long, with a wing; they are mostly dispersed by the wind, but some are also dispersed by Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers.

These ancient trees have a gnarled and stunted appearance, especially those found at high altitudes, and have reddish-brown bark with deep fissures. As the tree ages, much of its vascular cambium layer may die. In very old specimens, often only a narrow strip of living tissue connects the roots to a handful of live branches.

The Great Basin bristlecone pine differs from the Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine in that the needles of the former always have two uninterrupted resin canals, so it lacks the characteristic small white resin flecks appearing on the needles of the latter. The Great Basin bristlecone pine differs from the foxtail pine because the cone bristles of the former are over long, and the cones have a more rounded (not conic) base. The green pine needles give the twisted branches a bottle-brush appearance. The name &#x27;bristlecone pine&#x27; refers to the dark purple female cones that bear incurved prickles on their surface.
==Distribution and ecology==

The species occurs in Utah, Nevada and eastern California. In California, it is restricted to the White Mountains, the Inyo Mountains, and the Panamint Range, in Mono and Inyo counties. In Nevada, it is found in most of the higher ranges of the Basin and Range from the Spring Mountains near Las Vegas north to the Ruby Mountains, and in Utah, northeast to South Tent in the Wasatch Range. Due to the inaccessibility of many of the sites that this species occupies, information on their location and abundance is incomplete, and thus is needed.  Environmental niche modelling has been used to better map the distribution of Great Basin bristlecone pine using topographic and spectral variables calculated from a geographic information system (GIS).

The tree grows in large open stands, unlike the related foxtail pine, which sometimes form dense forests. &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot; trees generally do not form closed canopies, usually covering only 15-50%. &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot; shares habitats with a number of other pine species, including the ponderosa pine, the white fir and, notably, the limber pine, a similarly long-lived high-elevation species. The tree is a &quot;vigorous&quot; primary succession species, growing quickly on new open ground. It is a &quot;poor competitor&quot; in good soils, however, and the species does best in harsh terrain. &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot; is often the dominant species in high-elevation dolomite soils, where few plants can grow.
Bristlecone pines are protected in a number of areas owned by the United States federal government, such as the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest in the White Mountains of California and the Great Basin National Park in Nevada. These areas prohibit the cutting or gathering of wood.

Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers may play a role in seed distribution for &quot;P. longaeva&quot;, though direct observations of the birds foraging on these seeds have not been reported. The nutcrackers use conifer seeds as a food resource, storing many for later use in the ground, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new plants; these trees often exhibit a &quot;multi-trunk&quot; growth form from several seeds germinating at the same time. The prevalence of multi-trunk &quot;P. longaeva&quot; individuals in areas in which Clark&#x27;s Nutcrackers are present has been used as evidence that the birds disperse &quot;P. longaeva&quot; seeds.

An introduced fungal disease known as white pine blister rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;) is believed to affect some individuals. The species was placed on the IUCN Red List and listed as &quot;Vulnerable&quot;, or threatened, in 1998. In 2011, however, a population survey found the population of &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot; to be stable, with no known subpopulations decreasing in size. White pine blister rust was found to have a negligible effect on the population. As a result, the species was moved to &quot;Least Concern&quot;.

===Fire ecology===

The tree is extremely susceptible to fire, and is damaged by even low-intensity burns. The resinous bark is capable of igniting quickly, and a crown fire will almost certainly kill the tree. However, populations of &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot; are known to be extremely resilient, and as a primary succession species, it is believed that populations of the tree would reestablish itself quickly after a fire. That said, large-scale fires are extremely uncommon where the species grows, and are not a major factor in the species&#x27; long-term viability. Historically, &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot; stands experienced low to high severity fires, and fuels structures changed considerably across elevational gradients. In low elevation, mixed species stands, fuels are often heavy and in close proximity to anthropogenic ignition sources. Yet at high elevations near treeline, &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot; typically grow on limestone outcroppings that provide little or no surface fuels to propagate a wildfire. However, warmer temperatures will likely increase the duration of fire season, and thus the frequency of fire in &quot;Pinus longeava&quot; systems at low and mid elevations could increase where stands are typically denser and surface fuel is greatest. While rare, wild fires such as The Carpenter 1 fire in southern Nevada (July 2013) and the Phillips Fire in Great Basin National Park, (September 2000) that started in lower elevation fuel types and moved through the crowns of trees with the aid of extreme fire weather, could become more likely.

==Age==

A specimen located in the White Mountains of California was measured by Tom Harlan, a researcher with the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, to be 5,062 years old as of 2010. This would make it the oldest known non-clonal tree in the world. The identity of the specimen was kept secret by Harlan. Harlan passed away in 2013, and neither the tree nor the core Harlan studied have been found, making the age or existence of this tree unable to be confirmed.

The confirmed oldest tree of this species, &quot;Methuselah&quot;, is also located in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest of the White Mountains. Methuselah is years old, as measured by annual ring count on a small core taken with an increment borer. Its exact location is kept secret.

Among the White Mountain specimens, the oldest trees are found on north-facing slopes, with an average of 2,000 years, as compared to the 1,000 year average on the southern slopes. The climate and the durability of their wood can preserve them long after death, with dead trees as old as 7,000 years persisting next to live ones.

<text>The Haute Route (or the High Route or Mountaineers&#x27; Route) is the name given to a route (with several variations) undertaken on foot or by ski touring between Chamonix, France, and the Matterhorn, in Zermatt, Switzerland.

First charted as a summer mountaineering route by members of the English Alpine Club in the mid-19th century, the route takes around 12+ days walking (or 7+ days skiing) for the 180 km from the Chamonix valley, home of Mont Blanc, to Zermatt, home of the Matterhorn. Originally dubbed &quot;The High Level Route&quot; in English by members of the hiking club, the term was translated into French when first successfully undertaken on skis in 1911. Since then the French term has prevailed. While the term &quot;haute route&quot; has become somewhat genericized for any of the many multi-day, hut-to-hut alpine tours, the &quot;Chamonix-Zermatt Haute Route&quot; remains the original.

Besides the original Haute Route, there is nowadays also a &quot;Walker&#x27;s&quot; Haute Route, which is an alpine hiking trail that follows a network of well-marked and signposted paths. The &quot;Walker&#x27;s&quot; route stays below 3000 meters and takes advantage of the popular mountain huts and small inns and hotels in the villages along the way. In the spring, summer and fall, this route is safe, entirely non-technical (requires no ropes, crampons, or protection devices, unlike the actual Haute Route) and while challenging because of its daily elevation gains and distances, is achievable by any hiker in reasonably good physical condition.

The original Haute Route has large portions of glacier travel, for which suitable mountaineering gear and experience is necessary. In the winter, ski touring gear is required, and depending upon the weather and route chosen, may require crampons, ropes and avalanche protection gear.

==Summer Haute Routes==
There is occasionally a danger of collapsing glaciers which can render the path virtually impassable. However, a lower level variation exists that avoids crossing glaciers. The majority of hikers complete it in 12–16 days

==Ski Touring Haute Route==

First successfully completed in 1911, the Haute Route ski tour is probably the most famous and coveted ski tour in the world. Using high mountain huts to allow skiers to stay high and cover substantial distances, it winds through the highest, most dramatic peaks of the Alps from Mont Blanc to the Matterhorn. It requires good weather, favourable snow conditions and strong effort to complete this line. Because of this, roughly half of the skiers who begin the tour do not complete it.

There are many variations of the HLR (High Level Route) that work their way between Chamonix and Zermatt, including those listed below. It is also possible to add ascents of a number of ski peaks to any of the routes. The winter Haute Route deviates from the summer route to avoid terrain that is dangerous or impassable when snow-covered. Many people also ski the Haute Route in the opposite direction, by variations that select better ascent and descents.

Lionel Claudepierre, a member of PGHM of Bourg Saint Maurice, set a new record of 18h35m on Monday 15 April 2013.

=== Classic Route ===
The winter Haute Route&#x27;s original line which involves long climbs and mountaineering with ice axe and crampons.
*Day 1: Argentiere village, France, over the Col du Chardonnet and the Fenêtre du Saleina to the Trient Hut.
*Day 2: Champex-Lac via the Val d&#x27;Arpette. Bus or taxi to Bourg-Saint-Pierre.
*Day 3: Long climb up to the Valsorey Hut on the shoulder of Grand Combin.
*Day 4: Over the Plateau du Couloir and down the Glacier du Mont Durand to the Chanrion Hut.
*Day 5: A long climb up the Otemma Glacier to the Vignettes Hut.
*Day 6: A long day to Zermatt over the Col de l&#x27;Evêque, Col du Mont Brulé and Col de Valpelline, then a long descent under the shoulder of the Matterhorn and Dent d&#x27;Herens.
*Day 7: Optional extension to Saas-Fee over the Adler Pass.

*Day 7: Optional extension to Saas-Fee over the Adler Pass.

=== Grande Lui variation ===
A longer, harder, more technical route that eliminates the road break of the Verbier and Classic variations.
*Day 1: Argentiere village, France, over the Col du Chardonnet and the Fenêtre du Saleina to the Trient Hut or down to the Bivouac Dorés.
*Day 2: Over the Grande Lui through the Col du Saleina or around it via the Swiss Three Cols and a long descent to the village of La Fouly.
*Day 3: Up the Val Ferret and over to Grand St. Bernard Hospice.
*Day 4: Down to Great St Bernard Pass and over the shoulder of Mont Vélan to the Vélan Hut.
*Day 5: Up the Grand Combin and over the Plateau du Couloir, down the Glacier du Mont Durand to the Chanrion Hut.
*Day 6: A long non-technical climb up the Otemma Glacier or a stiffer climb over Les Portons to the Vignettes Hut.
*Day 7: A long day to Zermatt over the Col de l&#x27;Evêque, Col du Mont Brulé and Col de Valpelline, then a long descent under the shoulder of the Matterhorn and Dent d&#x27;Herens.
*Day 8: Optional extension to Saas-Fee over the Adler Pass.

===&quot;Backward&quot; Haute Route===
*Day 1: From Zermatt under the Matterhorn up to the Schonbiel Hut.
*Day 2: Over the Col de Valpelline and up to the Bertol Hut.
*Day 3: Down then up over Col Collon to the Vignettes Hut.
*Day 4: Over the Pigne d&#x27;Arolla and down Les Portons to Chanrion Hut.
*Day 5: Across the Otemma Gorge, up &amp; over into the Aosta Valley. Hitchhike to La Palud.
*Day 6: Ride the lift to the Vallée Blanche. Descend to Montenvers and ski or take the cog train out to Chamonix.

===Peaks and passes on the route===
See the route descriptions.

Optional ski peak ascents along the listed Haute Route variations include the Mont Blanc, Rosablanche, Pigne d&#x27;Arolla, Mont Blanc de Cheilon, Mont Vélan, Breithorn. Some of these peak ascents will require an additional day or more, and range from easy to very technical and difficult.

<doc id="649654" wikidata="Q420614" url="?curid=649654" title="Coronene">
<text>Coronene (also known as superbenzene and cyclobenzene) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) comprising seven peri-fused benzene rings. Its chemical formula is . It is a yellow material that dissolves in common solvents including benzene, toluene, and dichloromethane. Its solutions emit blue light fluorescence under UV light. It has been used as a solvent probe, similar to pyrene.

The compound is of theoretical interest to organic chemists because of its aromaticity. It can be described by 20 resonance structures or by a set of three mobile Clar sextets. In the Clar sextet case, most stable structure for coronene has only three isolated outer sextets as fully aromatic although superaromaticity would still be possible when these sextets are able to migrate into next ring.

==Occurrence and synthesis==

Coronene occurs naturally as the very rare mineral carpathite, characterized by flakes of pure coronene embedded in sedimentary rock. This mineral may be created from ancient hydrothermal vent activity. In earlier times this mineral was also called karpatite or pendletonite.

The presence of coronene putatively formed from contact of magma with fossil fuel deposits has been used to argue that Permian-Triassic “Great Dying” event was caused by a greenhouse gas warming episode triggered by large-scale Siberian vulcanism.

Coronene is produced in the petroleum-refining process of hydrocracking, where it can dimerize to a fifteen ring PAH, trivially named &quot;dicoronylene&quot; . Centimeter-long crystals can be grown from a supersaturated solution of molecules in toluene (ca. 2.5 mg/ml), which is slowly cooled (ca. 0.04 K/min) from 328 K to 298 K over a period of 12 hours.

==Structure==

Coronene is a planar circulene. It forms needle-like crystals with a monoclinic, herringbone-like structure. The most common polymorph is γ, but β form can also be produced in an applied magnetic field (ca. 1 Tesla) or by phase transition from γ decreasing the temperature below 158 K. The structure containing two C-H groups on one benzene ring, so-called DUO, was analyzed by infrared spectroscopy.

==Other uses==

Coronene has been used in the synthesis of graphene. For example, coronene molecules evaporated onto a copper surface at 1000 degrees Celsius will form a graphene lattice which can then be transferred onto another substrate.

<text>The Nose, Op. 15, () is Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s first opera, a satirical work completed in 1928 based on Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s 1836 story of the same name.

==Style and structure==
The opera was written between 1927 and 1928. The libretto is by Shostakovich, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Georgy Ionin, and Alexander Preis. Shostakovich stated it was a satire on the times of Alexander I. The plot concerns a Saint Petersburg official whose nose leaves his face and develops a life of its own.

Gogol&#x27;s original work was expanded by borrowing from some of his other works, including &quot;The Overcoat&quot;, &quot;Marriage&quot;, &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, and &quot;Dead Souls&quot; as well as &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1881) by Dostoyevsky. The latter occurs in act 2, scene 6, where Kovalyov returns home to find Ivan singing. The song is Shostakovich&#x27;s setting of the words of part 2, book 5, chapter 2 of &quot;Karamazov&quot;, where the lackey, Smerdiakov, sings to his neighbour Mariia Kondratevna.

An invisible force ties to my beloved. Bless us, O Lord, her and me! Her and me! I&#x27;ll give up a king&#x27;s crown, if my beloved is happy. Bless us, O Lord, her and me! Her and me!

Shostakovich uses a montage of different styles, including folk music, popular song, and atonality. The apparent chaos is given structure by formal musical devices such as canons and quartets, a device taken from Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot;.

According to the British composer Gerard McBurney writing for Boosey &amp; Hawkes, &quot;&quot;The Nose&quot; is one of the young Shostakovich’s greatest masterpieces, an electrifying tour de force of vocal acrobatics, wild instrumental colours and theatrical absurdity, all shot through with a blistering mixture of laughter and rage... The result, in Shostakovich&#x27;s ruthlessly irreverent hands, is like an operatic version of Charlie Chaplin or Monty Python... despite its magnificently absurd subject and virtuosic music, &quot;The Nose&quot; is a perfectly practical work and provides a hugely entertaining evening in the theatre.&quot;

==Performance history==
In June 1929, &quot;The Nose&quot; was given a concert performance, against Shostakovich&#x27;s own wishes: &quot;&quot;The Nose&quot; loses all meaning if it is seen just as a musical composition. For the music springs only from the action...It is clear to me that a concert performance of &quot;The Nose&quot; will destroy it.&quot; Indeed, the concert performance caused bewilderment, and was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM).

The original plan was to mount a stage production at the Bolshoi Theatre under the direction of Vsevolod Meyerhold, but plans fell through because Meyerhold was too busy with other productions. The stage premiere, conducted by Samuil Samosud, took place at the Maly Operny Theatre in Leningrad on 18 January 1930. It opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension amongst musicians. Even so, the conductor Nikolai Malko, who had taught Shostakovich at the Leningrad Conservatory and conducted the premiere of his pupil&#x27;s First Symphony, reckoned the opera a &quot;tremendous success&quot;; indeed it was given 16 performances with two alternating casts over six months.

The opera was not performed again in the Soviet Union until 1974, when it was revived by Gennady Rozhdestvensky and Boris Pokrovsky. Interviewed for a 2008 documentary, Rozhdestvensky related that he had found an old copy of &quot;The Nose&quot; in the Bolshoi Theatre in 1974, supposedly the last copy in the Soviet Union. The composer attended the rehearsal and premiere in 1974.

&quot;The Nose&quot; was given its Italian premiere on 23 May 1964 by the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence. The cast included Renato Capecchi (Platòn Kusnic Kavaliòf), Italo Tajo (Ivàn Jákovlevic), Antonio Pirino (the Nose), Cesy Broggini (Pelagia Grigorievna Podtochina) and Jolanda Meneguzzer (Podtochina&#x27;s daughter). It was conducted by Bruno Bartoletti and directed by Eduardo De Filippo. The set designs were by Mino Maccari.It was the first performance in Europe since the 1930 stage premiere in Leningrad.

The opera received its United States professional premiere at the Santa Fe Opera in 1965, conducted by Erich Kunzel and was performed again by the Santa Fe company in 1987, conducted by Edo de Waart. It was performed in July 2004 at Bard College&#x27;s SummerScape in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, directed by Francesca Zambello and performed by the American Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leon Botstein.

The opera was staged at Opera Boston in early 2009, and at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in March 2010. This production was revived in 2013, and was beamed to cinemas around the world as part of the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD programme on 26 October.

Barrie Kosky&#x27;s production of a new English-language version by David Pountney for The Royal Opera, Opera Australia and the Komische Oper Berlin premiered in 2016 at the Royal Opera House in London, Kosky&#x27;s debut at that house, and in 2018 at the Sydney Opera House and in Berlin.

Opera in 3 acts and 10 scenes, without intermission.

===Act 1===

====Prologue====
St Petersburg. Kovalyov, a Collegiate Assessor is being shaved by Ivan Yakovlevich (a barber). He is one of Yakovlevich&#x27;s regular customers.

The next morning, Yakovlevich finds a nose in his bread. His wife, believing he has cut off one of his customers&#x27; noses, requests him to dispose of it. He tries to dispose of it in the street, but is foiled by running into people he knows, then he throws it into the Neva River, but he is seen by a police officer and taken away for questioning. Meanwhile, Kovalyov wakes and finds his nose missing. His first reaction is disbelief, then shock, and he sets out to find it. He later sees his nose praying in the Kazan Cathedral, now the size of a human being. Since the nose has acquired a higher rank (State Councillor) than he, it refuses to have any dealings with him, and leaves.

===Act 2===
In his search, Kovalyov finds himself at the Chief of Police&#x27;s apartment, but he is not at home. Next he visits the newspaper office to place an advertisement about the loss of his nose, where they are dealing with a missing dog. After explaining his loss, his request is refused on the grounds of the newspaper&#x27;s reputation. Upon demonstrating his loss, the clerk suggests he tell his story. Kovalyov feels insulted and leaves.

He returns to his apartment, where his servant is playing the balalaika, he dismisses him and wallows in self-pity.

===Act 3===
The police take up the search. A group of policemen are at a railway station, in order to prevent the nose from escaping, where an inspector rallies them. The nose runs in and tries to stop the train, and a general pursuit ensues, resulting in its capture. The nose is then beaten into its normal size, wrapped and returned to Kovalyov by the inspector, but Kovalyov is unable to reattach it. Nor can a doctor. He then suspects that he has been placed under a spell by a woman called Madame Podtochina, because he would not marry her daughter. He writes to ask her to undo the spell, but she misinterprets the letter as a proposal to her daughter. She convinces him that she is innocent. In the city, crowds fuelled by rumours gather in search of the nose till the police restore order.

====Epilogue====
Kovalyov wakes up with his nose reattached, and dances a polka in joy. Yakovlevich has been released from prison and arrives to shave him. Afterwards Kovalyov wanders along Nevsky Prospekt greeting acquaintances, while people discuss the story.

<text>The Mizrachi () is a religious Zionist organization founded in 1902 in Vilnius at a world conference of religious Zionists called by Rabbi Yitzchak Yaacov Reines. Bnei Akiva, which was founded in 1929, is the youth movement associated with Mizrachi. Both Mizrachi and the Bnei Akiva youth movement continued to function as international movements. Here the word &quot;Mizrahi&quot; is a notarikon (a kind of acronym) for &quot;Merkaz Ruhani&quot; lit. &quot;Spiritual centre&quot;: מרכז רוחני, introduced by rabbi Samuel Mohilever.

Mizrachi believes that the Torah should be at the centre of Zionism and also sees Jewish nationalism as a means of achieving religious objectives. The Mizrachi Party was the first official religious Zionist party and founded the Ministry of Religious Affairs in State of Israel and pushed for laws enforcing kashrut and the observance of the sabbath in the workplace. It also played a role prior to the establishment of Israel, building a network of religious schools that exist to this day, and took part in the 1951 elections.

==In Poland==
During the interwar period, the Mizrachi party was represented in the kehilla councils as well as in the municipal councils and in the Polish Sejm and Senate, e.g. by the Vilnius Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Rubinstein (1888–1945), Mizrachi senator (1922–1930, 1938–1939) and deputy (1930–1935), and by Rabbi Simon Federbusch, Sejm member from 1922 until 1927.

==In Israel==
Major figures in the Religious Zionist Movement include Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook who became the Ashkenazi Jews Chief Rabbi of the British Mandate of Palestine in 1924 and tried to reconcile Zionism with Orthodox Judaism. However, Kook refused to be associated with Mizrachi specifically.

Mizrachi had a separate trade union wing, founded in 1921, Hapoel HaMizrachi, which represented religious Jews in the Histadrut and tried to attract religious Labor Zionists. The trade union also operated as a political party by the same name in the early days of Israel&#x27;s existence, becoming the fourth-largest party in the 1951 elections.

In 1956, the Mizrachi party and Hapoel HaMizrachi merged to form the National Religious Party to advance the rights of religious Jews in Israel, having fought the 1955 election together as the National Religious Front. The party was an ever-present government coalition member until 1992. In 2008, the party merged into The Jewish Home, essentially a successor party.

==In the United States==
In the United States the ideals of and work of the Mizrachi movement have been carried out through the official Religious Zionists of America (RZA) movement that has been an important source of the ideology and guidance for Modern Orthodox Judaism and its rabbis and followers. It is affiliated with the Bnei Akiva youth movement which has a great influence on the Modern Orthodox Jewish day schools and synagogues. The American movement has served as a fundraising and lobbying arm for its Israeli counterparts.

Many of the Jewish leaders and rabbis of Yeshiva University actively identify with and support Mizrachi.

== In Latvia ==

In interwar Latvia, the Mizrahi (Mizrachi) political movement was regularly represented in the parliament, the Saeima until 1934, as well as engaged in other public activities.

<text>Daniel Bautista Alcántara (born May 24, 1972) is a Dominican former Major League Baseball outfielder.

Bautista was signed by the Detroit Tigers in 1989. In 1993, he joined the major leagues with the Tigers. Although he hit for an average of .331 his first season as a Tiger, his power numbers there were not spectacular, and his batting average as a member of the Tigers decreased considerably over the next four seasons.

In 1996, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for a minor leaguer. He played three seasons there as a reserve outfielder, but he also failed to produce good offensive numbers, his best batting average as a Brave being .250 in 1998. His most notable moment as a Brave may have been on June 27, 1996, when a pitch by Jeff Parrett hit him in the face and broke his eye socket, sending him to the hospital and ending his season.

He produced somewhat better offensive numbers as a member of the Florida Marlins in 1999, hitting for an average of .288. In 2000, he continued his improvement in offensive numbers, hitting double digits in homeruns for the first time in his career (11), while hitting for an average of .317 after a midseason trade to the Arizona Diamondbacks. He ended that year hitting a combined season average of .283. He would reach double digit homeruns once more in his final MLB season; hitting 11 in 2004.

Bautista won a World Series ring when the Diamondbacks beat the New York Yankees in seven games at the 2001 World Series, hitting .583 in the Series, fifth all-time in a single World Series.

In 2004, Bautista hit safely in 21 consecutive games. The streak ended during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies when Bautista went hitless in two at-bats. Bautista announced his retirement from baseball on March 19, 2005, following an ankle injury. Bautista had, at the time of his retirement, 685 hits at the major league level with a batting average of .272.

Danny played in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated with MLB, for the York Revolution in the first season of the team&#x27;s existence. After a trade, he played for the Camden Riversharks.

<doc id="649664" wikidata="Q332556" url="?curid=649664" title="Absolutely Free">
<text>Absolutely Free is the second album by American rock band the Mothers of Invention, released on May 26, 1967, by Verve Records. Much like their 1966 debut &quot;Freak Out!&quot;, the album is a display of complex musical composition with political and social satire, whose blend of jazz, classical, avant-garde and rock idioms within multi-sectional, suite-like compositions is seen as an important and influential precursor to progressive rock. The band had been augmented since &quot;Freak Out!&quot; by the addition of woodwinds player Bunk Gardner, keyboardist Don Preston, rhythm guitarist Jim Fielder, and drummer Billy Mundi; Fielder quit the group before the album was released, and his name was removed from the album credits.

==Background and Recording==
&quot;Freak Out!&quot; cost Verve $20,000 to make, more than double the cost of a typical album at the time. When it struggled to sell, the record company only allowed a budget of $11,000 for the follow up, which was recorded on four-track over just four days from November 15–18, 1966 at TTG studios in Los Angeles, with additional mixing and editing at MGM in New York City a week later. Tom Wilson again sat in the producer&#x27;s chair, although it is generally agreed that he took a hands-off approach and let Zappa have full creative control. Unlike &quot;Freak Out!&quot;, which used extensive orchestration, the budget this time only allowed for orchestral additions to &quot;Brown Shoes Don&#x27;t Make It&quot;, with the band playing virtually live in the studio for most tracks. Since many of the songs were complex multi-sectional pieces, the group would do up to 30 takes of each specific section of a track, which were then strung together in editing. According to Zappa, the group had &quot;one day with 15 minutes per tune to do all the vocals on that album. That&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s called &#x27;sing or get off the pot&#x27;.&quot;

==Songs==
Zappa intended the album to be divided into two operatic suites with all the songs continually linked, which at the time of recording predated the release of The Who&#x27;s &quot;A Quick One While He&#x27;s Away&quot; and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. The first suite, entitled &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;, is essentially a send-up of a romantic love story with fruits and vegetables acting as a metaphor for people; the second suite, &quot;The M.O.I. American Pageant&quot;, is a trenchant social commentary on American life including aspects of social status and mobility, consumerism, alcoholism, greed, and political corruption.

Plastic People

&quot;Plastic People&quot; evolved from the group&#x27;s cover of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, with new lyrics. It opens with an announcement of the President of the United States, who is ill and needs chicken soup, before going on to critique the &quot;plastic&quot; hippies who hung out at clubs like Pandora&#x27;s Box, the epicenter of the Sunset Strip Riots happening at the time of the album&#x27;s recording. &quot;Son of Suzy Creamcheese&quot; later in the album goes further into the subject, which presages the themes of The Mothers&#x27; next album.

The Duke of Prunes

The primary subject of the suite, food, appears on this mock- love ballad with comedic lyrics improvised by Ray Collins, who, as the Duke of Prunes, attempts to pick up a woman at the supermarket by using food references that are meant as euphemisms for sex. The track was based on an original piece called &quot;And Very True&quot;, which Zappa had composed for the score of a Western called &quot;Run Home, Slow&quot;.

Amnesia Vivace

According to the album&#x27;s libretto, the Duke attempts to pick up two cheerleaders in a parking lot when they bash him in the face, giving him amnesia. This is portrayed musically as a one minute free-jazz freak out which eventually quotes Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Firebird&quot;.

The Duke Regains His Chops

The Duke suddenly recovers his memory as a reprise of &quot;Duke of Prunes&quot; appears in a faster tempo before the Duke attempts his final pick-up by singing a Supremes-like tune reminiscent of &quot;Baby Love&quot;.

Call Any Vegetable

The food imagery continues on this frantic rocker, although Zappa claimed &quot;vegetables&quot; referred to people who are inactive in society, but who might be &quot;woken up&quot; if moved sufficiently—hence the idea to call the vegetable and release the person from apathy.

Invocation and Ritual Dance of the Young Pumpkin

This seven-minute instrumental opens with a quote from Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot; before morphing into a wild, proto-jazz fusion group jam in which Zappa displays his improvisational guitar skills for the first time on record.

Soft-Cell Conclusion

A reprise of &quot;Call Any Vegetable&quot;, somewhat slower and bluesier with harmonica accompaniment, in which Zappa instructs his listeners how to call to vegetables. The speed then increases to a very fast tempo before ending on a series of sexual pants.

America Drinks

The second suite opens with this send-up of a lounge ballad, sung deliberately off-tempo as if the singer is very drunk, to illustrate the empty phoniness of American culture. This is followed by quotes from Fucik&#x27;s &quot;Entrance of the Gladiators&quot; and the overture to Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Tsar&#x27;s Bride&quot;, for a cartoonish circus ambience.

Status Back Baby

One of Zappa&#x27;s doo-wop parodies, although there are oblique insertions of quotes from Stravinsky and Debussy. The lyrical content skewers high school social cliques, as a self-absorbed jock finds he&#x27;s losing status with the pom-pom girls.

Uncle Bernie&#x27;s Farm

This relatively straightforward, fast-paced rocker critiques the makers of violent children&#x27;s toys and compares them to the child&#x27;s equally plastic parents. It closes with several overlapping voices attempting to sell the listener toy bombs, rockets, intestines, brass knuckles, and other grotesque products.

Son of Suzy Creamcheese

The character of Suzy Creamcheese, a groupie, was first introduced on &quot;Freak Out!&quot; Here we learn more about her desire to be &quot;in&quot; as she drops acid, stays out all night on Sunset Strip, steals her boyfriend&#x27;s stash of drugs and attends a protest march in Berkeley. Zappa admitted that the rocker was one of the most difficult songs for The Mothers to learn to play due to its dizzying change of time signatures, moving between 4/4, 8/8, 9/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8 and back to 4/4.

Brown Shoes Don&#x27;t Make It

Described by François Couture of AllMusic as a &quot;condensed two-hour musical&quot;, the album&#x27;s longest song, at over seven minutes, moves through 22 distinct sections covering psychedelia, chamber music, Sprechstimme, garage rock, classical, music hall, doo-wop, The Beach Boys, electronics, and more. It is the only track on the album to feature outside orchestration, which climaxes the piece. There is also a homemade synthesizer played by Don Preston, one of the earliest appearances of such an instrument on a rock record. The song&#x27;s primary subject is corruption in politics, as a city hall official fantasizes sleeping with a thirteen-year-old girl in graphic detail. The line &quot;I&#x27;d like to make her do a nasty on the White House lawn&quot; apparently held up the album&#x27;s release, as an MGM exec protested its inclusion and wanted to change the line to &quot;I&#x27;d like to make her do a crossword puzzle on the back of TV Guide.&quot;

America Drinks and Goes Home

A reprise of &quot;America Drinks&quot; set at the &quot;Pompadour-a-Go-Go&quot;, this is a similar piano-based lounge ballad Zappa penned in 1964 over which sounds of drinking, gambling, and slot machines get louder until the song fades and only the sounds of drunk partygoers&#x27; grotesque laughs and screams remain, meant to illustrate the casual disrespect such audiences have for the performers. There is a stylistic similarity between this number and the later Beatles B-side &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)&quot; as well as The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;On with the Show&quot;.

==Album Cover and Libretto==
The album was planned for release in January 1967 but ran into trouble when Verve objected to Zappa&#x27;s idea of printing the lyrics on the back cover, as well as to the phrase &quot;war means work for all&quot; on a billboard included in the illustrated collage which had also been constructed by Zappa. Months passed before a compromise was reached: the lyrics would not be printed on the album, but it was allowed for an ad to be placed in the gatefold for listeners to send one dollar for a complete libretto booklet containing lyrics and plot explanations. 
==Release and Reception==
The album was eventually released on May 26, 1967. This was incidentally the same day as the UK release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, which also had the idea of printed lyrics and no gaps between its songs; had &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;&#x27;s release not been significantly delayed by issues over its cover art and lyrics, it would have predated The Beatles on these innovations. The album fared much better overall than &quot;Freak Out!&quot;, charting at #41 on Billboard and becoming a favorite of the underground.

In a contemporary review, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine wondered whether the band were putting their audience on, but concluded that the album would rack up huge sales. Retrospectively, the album has received high praise as an early peak for Zappa&#x27;s lyrical and compositional innovation, which had evolved considerably since &quot;Freak Out!&quot;. AllMusic calls it a &quot;fabulously inventive record, bursting at the seams with ideas&quot; while &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; awarded four-and-a-half stars. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was somewhat less charitable, claiming that &quot;as rock and roll it&#x27;s a moderately amusing novelty record, much too obvious in its satire.&quot;

In the book &quot;Necessity Is...&quot;, former Mothers of Invention band member Ray Collins said that &quot;Absolutely Free&quot; is probably his favorite of the classic Mothers albums.

==Versions==
The UK-67 release (Verve VLP/SVLP 9174) came in a laminated flip-back cover, with a Mike Raven poem at the reverse that was not on any other issue.

The CD reissue adds, between sides one and two, two songs that were featured on a rare Verve single of the time. The songs from the single, &quot;Why Dontcha Do Me Right?&quot; (titled &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Do Me Right&quot; on the 45) and &quot;Big Leg Emma&quot;, were both described as &quot;an attempt to make dumb music to appeal to dumb teenagers&quot;.

<doc id="649665" wikidata="Q1577041" url="?curid=649665" title="Religious Zionism">
<text>Religious Zionism () is a religious denomination that views Zionism as a fundamental component of Orthodox Judaism. Its adherents are also referred to as Dati Leumi (), and in Israel, they are most commonly known by the plural form of the first part of that term: Datiim (). The community is sometimes called &#x27;Knitted kippah&#x27; (), the typical head covering worn by male adherents to Religious Zionism.

Before the establishment of the State of Israel, most Religious Zionists were observant Jews who supported Zionist efforts to build a Jewish state in the Land of Israel. Religious Zionism revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel. The Hardal () are a sub-community, stricter in its observance, and more statist in its politics. Those Religious Zionists who are less strict in their observance – although not necessarily more liberal in their politics – are informally referred to as &quot;&quot;dati&quot; lite&quot;.

== History ==
In 1862, German Orthodox Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer published his tractate &quot;Derishat Zion&quot;, positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the Prophets, can come about only by self-help. Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Glasner was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, who justified Zionism according to Jewish law, and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular Labour Zionists to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring Geula (&quot;salvation&quot;) to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the re-foundation of the Jewish homeland, the Messiah will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Mandatory Palestine, he tried to reconcile Zionism with Orthodox Judaism.

== Ideology ==

Religious Zionists believe that &quot;Eretz Israel&quot; (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient Israelites by God. Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the Torah&#x27;s high standards of justice. To generations of diaspora Jews, Jerusalem has been a symbol of the Holy Land and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous Biblical prophecies. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by human agency was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God&#x27;s power, and therefore, a rebellion against God.

Rabbi Kook developed a theological answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: &quot;Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of God to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland – the land He promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God wants the children of Israel to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of Torah and Halakha, and commit the Mitzvot of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the Land of Israel). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling Israel is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God&#x27;s will.&quot;

Socialist Zionism envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced socialist society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of antisemitism. The early kibbutz was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as kashrut. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook&#x27;s answer was as follows:Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact – the actual reason for them coming to resettle in Israel is a religious Jewish spark (&quot;Nitzotz&quot;) in their soul, planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great Mitzvah.

The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is Judaism and teach them Torah with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of Torah are the key to true harmony and a socialist state (not in the Marxist meaning) that will be a light for the nations and bring salvation to the world.Shlomo Avineri explained the last part of Kook&#x27;s answer: &quot;... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation – their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.&quot; (page 2221)

== Ideological opposition to Zionism ==
Some Haredi Jews view establishing Jewish sovereignty in the Holy Land before the coming of the Messiah as forbidden, as a violation of the Three Oaths. This would apply whether those who established this sovereignty were religious or secular.

Another reason Haredi Jews opposed Zionism that had nothing to do with the establishment of a state or immigration to Palestine was the ideology of secular Zionism itself. Zionism&#x27;s goal was first and foremost a transformation of the Jewish People from a religious society – whose sole shared characteristic was the Torah – into a political nationality, with a common land, language, and culture.

Elchonon Wasserman said:The nationalist concept of the Jewish people as an ethnic or nationalistic entity has no place among us, and it&#x27;s nothing but a foreign implant into Judaism; it is nothing but idolatry. And its younger sister, &quot;religious nationalism (l&#x27;umis datis)&quot;, is idol worship that combines Hashem&#x27;s name and heresy together (avodah zarah b&#x27;shituf).

Chaim Brisker said, &quot;The Zionists have already won because they got the Jews to look at themselves as a nation.&quot;

Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, also known as the Rebbe Rashab, was the fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe. He opposed both secular and religious Zionism. In 1903, he published &quot;Kuntres Uma&#x27;ayan&quot;, which included a strong criticism against Zionism. He was concerned that nationalism would replace Judaism as the basis of Jewish identity.

Rav Elyashiv also denounced the actions of religious Jews joining Zionist organizations as separating from authentic Judaism. In 2010, Rav Elyashiv published a letter criticizing the Shas Party for joining the World Zionist Organization (WZO)&quot;.&quot; He wrote that the Party &quot;is turning its back on the basics of Charedi Jewry of the past hundred years. He compared this move to the decision of the Mizrachi movement to join the WZO [over one hundred years ago], which was the deciding factor in their separation from authentic Torah Judaism.

== Organizations ==
The first rabbis to support Zionism were Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai and Zvi Hirsch Kalischer. They argued that the change in the status of Western Europe&#x27;s Jews following emancipation was the first step toward redemption (גאולה), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation – whose main pillars are the &quot;Kibbutz Galuyot&quot; (&quot;Gathering of the Exiles&quot;), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (עבודת אדמה), and the revival of the everyday use of the Hebrew language.

The Mizrachi organization was established in 1902 in Vilna at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a youth movement, Bnei Akiva, which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the Torah should be at the centre of Zionism, a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan &quot;Am Yisrael B&#x27;Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael&quot; (&quot;The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel&quot;). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.

In 1937–1948, the Religious Kibbutz Movement established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the Beit Shean Valley, the second was in the Hebron mountains south of Bethlehem (known as Gush Etzion), and the third was in the western Negev. Kibbutz Yavne was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.

== Political parties ==
The Labor Movement wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan &quot;Torah va&#x27;Avodah&quot; (Torah and Labor), was called HaPoel HaMizrachi. It represented religiously traditional Labour Zionists, both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the Histadrut. In 1956, Mizrachi, HaPoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the National Religious Party (NRP) to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel.

The NRP operated as an independent political party until the 2003 elections. In the 2006 elections, the NRP merged with the National Union (HaIchud HaLeumi). In the 2009 elections, the Jewish Home (HaBayit HaYehudi) was formed in place of the NRP.

Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are Gush Emunim, Tkuma, and Meimad. Kahanism, a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose party, Kach, was eventually banned from the Knesset.

Today, Otzma Yehudit and National Religious Party–Religious Zionism are the leading Dati Leumi parties.

== Educational institutions ==

The flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the yeshiva founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor &quot;Mercaz haRav&quot; (lit., the Rabbi&#x27;s center).
Other Religious Zionist yeshivot include Ateret Cohanim, Beit El yeshiva, and Yeshivat Or Etzion, founded by Rabbi Haim Druckman, a foremost disciple of Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook.
Machon Meir is specifically outreach-focused.

There are approximately 90 &quot;Hesder&quot; yeshivot, allowing students to continue their Torah study during their National Service (see below).
The first of these was Yeshivat Kerem B&#x27;Yavneh, established in 1954; the largest is the Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot, with over 800 students.
Others which are well known include Yeshivat Har Etzion, Yeshivat HaKotel, Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Maale Adumim, Yeshivat Har Bracha, Yeshivat Sha&#x27;alvim, and Yeshivat Har Hamor.

These institutions usually offer a kollel for &quot;Semikha&quot;, or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the &quot;Semikha&quot; test of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel (the &quot;Rabbanut&quot;); until his passing in 2020, often for that of the posek R. Zalman Nechemia Goldberg.
Training as a Dayan (rabbinic judge) in this community is usually through &quot;Machon Ariel&quot; (&quot;Machon Harry Fischel&quot;), also founded by Rav Kook, or &quot;Kollel Eretz Hemda&quot;; the Chief Rabbinate also commonly.
The Meretz Kollel has trained hundreds of community Rabbis.

Women study in institutions which are known as &quot;Midrashot&quot; (sing.: Midrasha) – prominent examples are Midreshet Ein HaNetziv and Migdal Oz. These are usually attended for one year either before or after &quot;sherut leumi&quot;.
Various &quot;midrashot&quot; offer parallel degree coursework, and they may then be known as a &quot;machon&quot;.
The Midrashot focus on Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and &quot;Machshavah&quot; (Jewish thought); some offer specialized training in Halakha: 
Nishmat certifies women as &quot;Yoatzot Halacha&quot;, Midreshet Lindenbaum as &quot;to&#x27;anot&quot;; 
Lindenbaum, Matan, and Ein HaNetziv offer Talmud-intensive programs in rabbinic-level halakha.
Community education programs are offered by &quot;Emunah&quot;, and Matan, across the country.

For degree studies, many attend Bar Ilan University, which allows students to combine Torah study with university study, especially through its &quot;Machon HaGavoah LeTorah&quot;; 
Jerusalem College of Technology similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).
There are also several colleges of education which are associated with the &quot;Hesder&quot; and the &quot;Midrashot&quot;, such as Herzog College, Talpiot, and the Lifshitz College of Education. These colleges often offer (master&#x27;s level) specializations in Tanakh and &quot;Machshava&quot;.

High school students study at &quot;Mamlachti Dati&quot; (religious state) schools,
 often associated with &quot;Bnei Akiva&quot;.
These schools offer intensive Torah study alongside the matriculation syllabus, and emphasize tradition and observance; see . 
The first of these schools was established at Kfar Haroeh by Moshe-Zvi Neria in 1939; 
&quot;Yashlatz&quot;, associated with Mercaz HaRav, was founded in 1964, and predates several schools similarly linked to &quot;Hesder yeshivot&quot;, such as that at Sha&#x27;alvim;
see also the school-networks AMIT and Tachkemoni.
Today, there are 60 such institutions, with more than 20,000 students. A &quot;Dati Leumi&quot; girls&#x27; high school is referred to as an &quot;&quot;Ulpana&quot;; a boys’ high school is a &quot;Yeshiva Tichonit&quot;&quot;.

Some institutions are aligned with the &quot;Hardal&quot; community, with an ideology that is somewhat more &quot;statist&quot;.
The leading Yeshiva here is Har Hamor;
several high schools also operate.

== Politics ==

Most Religious Zionists embrace right-wing politics, especially the religious right-wing Jewish Home party and more recently the Religious Zionist Party, but many also support the mainstream right-wing Likud. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi Michael Melchior, whose views were represented by the Meimad party (which ran together with the Israeli Labor party). Many Israeli settlers in the West Bank are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the Gaza Strip in August and September 2005.

== Military service ==

Generally, all adult Jewish males and females in Israel are obligated to serve in the IDF. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service, in order to engage in full-time Torah study for purpose of spiritual development in unison with warfare. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.

For this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the Hesder program, a concept conceived by Rabbi Yehuda Amital which allows military service to be combined with yeshiva studies. Some others attend a pre-army Mechina educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. 
Students at Mercaz HaRav, and some Hardal yeshivot, undertake their service through a modified form of Hesder.

While some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as Sherut Leumi, instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).
In November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism, in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF. The IDF undertook that all modesty and kosher issues will be handled, in order to make female Religious Zionists comfortable.

== Dress ==

Religious Zionists are often called &quot;Kippot sruggot&quot;, or &quot;sruggim&quot;, in reference to the knitted or crocheted &quot;kippot&quot; (skullcaps; sing. &quot;kippah&quot;) which are worn by the men (although some of the men wear other types of head coverings, such as black velvet &quot;kippot&quot;). Otherwise – particularly for the &quot;dati lite&quot; – their style of dress is largely the same as secular Israelis, with jeans less common; on Shabbat, they wear a stereotypically white dress shirt (recently a polo shirt in some sectors), and often a white &quot;kippah&quot;. Women usually wear (long) skirts, and often cover their hair, usually with a hair accessory, as opposed to a &quot;sheitel&quot; (wig) in the Haredi style.

In the &quot;Hardal&quot; community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat. The kippot, which are also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for tzitzit to be visibly worn, in keeping with the Haredi practice; &quot;payot&quot; (sidelocks) are similarly common, as is an (untrimmed) beard. Women invariably cover their hair – usually with a snood, or a &quot;mitpachat&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;kerchief&quot;) – and often wear sandals; their skirts are longer and looser fitting. On Shabbat, men often wear a (blue) suit – atypical in Israel outside the Haredi world – and a large white crocheted &quot;kippah&quot;.

At prayer, the members of the community typically use the Koren Siddur or the &quot;Rinat Yisrael&quot;. Homes often have on their bookshelves a set of the Steinsaltz Talmud (much as the Artscroll is to be found in American &quot;Haredi&quot; homes), &quot;Mishnah&quot; with Kehati, &quot;Rambam La&#x27;Am&quot;, Peninei Halakha, and/or &quot;Tzurba M&#x27;Rabanan&quot;; as well as a selection of the numerous popular books by leading &quot;Dati Leumi&quot; figures on the weekly parsha, the festivals, and &quot;hashkafa&quot; (discussions on Jewish thought). Similar to Haredi families, more religious homes will also have all of &quot;The Traditional Jewish Bookshelf&quot;.

<text>Mayra Cristina Gómez Martínez (14 February 1948 – 13 October 2024), better known as Mayra Gómez Kemp, was a Cuban-Spanish television host, actress and singer. She was the host of &quot;Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez&quot; from 1982 to 1988.

She was the first woman in the world to host a TV quiz show.

==Life and career==
Mayra Cristina Gómez Martínez Kemp Febles was born on 14 February 1948 in Havana, Cuba. She was the daughter of two famous Cuban artists, Ramiro Gómez Kemp and Velia Martínez. She had an older sister named Georgina, who is an accountant in Miami. On 1 February 1960, her family moved to Puerto Rico, later moving to Venezuela and finally settling in Miami. In 1966, as a college student she appeared in the William Grefé-directed &quot;B&quot;-movie &quot;The Death Curse of Tartu&quot;, under the stage name Mayra Christine. In the 1970s, Mayra went to Spain to perform in the Spanish theatrical production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. On stage, she worked alongside Argentine actor Alberto Berco who played the role of the narrator, who in time became her husband.

In 1976, when the successful Televisión Española game show &quot;Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez&quot; returned to television to be broadcast in color for the first time, Mayra auditioned for the role of one of the secretaries on the program. Although she wasn&#x27;t selected as a secretary, she was hired to perform small roles as a comic actress on the show and Mayra&#x27;s appearances made her famous by the time she left the show in 1977.

That year, Mayra teamed with two of the show&#x27;s former secretaries, María Durán and Beatriz Escudero, to form the pop vocal band Trío Acuario (Aquarius Trio because that was the zodiac sign of all three women). With Mayra as lead vocalist, they enjoyed a brief but intense popularity thanks to their vocal skills and their charmingly sexy image, scoring a summer hit with &quot;Rema, Rema, Marinero&quot; (&quot;Row, Row, Sailor&quot;). Mayra left the group in 1978 to pursue a solo career, recording the album &quot;Una Dama&quot; (&quot;One Lady&quot;), which included her cover of Julio Ramos&#x27;s anti-abortion pop hit &quot;No Te Dejan Nacer&quot; (&quot;They Won&#x27;t Let You Be Born&quot;).

She began her career as a television presenter on Television Española programs such as &quot;625 Lineas&quot; (her debut as presenter and first TP de Oro out of four as best presenter) and &quot;Ding Dong&quot;. Mayra also returned to film in 1978 with &quot;Donde Hay Patrón...&quot;, starring alongside Manolo Escobar. After becoming a Spanish citizen, Mayra turned to radio as one of the original announcers on the new station Antena 3 (now defunct). Along with other presenters she appeared on the children&#x27;s show &quot;Sabadabada&quot;, later titled &quot;Dabadabada&quot;. She left &quot;Dabadabada&quot; in 1982 when she was chosen by Chicho Ibáñez Serrador as a substitute for Kiko Ledgard, the famous host of &quot;Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez&quot;, who had suffered a near-fatal accident. Mayra won the audience over and remained with the program for six years, longer than any other host, earning three more TP awards for best host.

After leaving the show in 1988, she continued working on radio and hosted the chat show &quot;Tres mas Una&quot; on regional station Canal Sur.

With the launch of commercial television in Spain in 1989, Mayra returned to television and hosted &quot;La Ruleta de la Fortuna&quot;, Spain&#x27;s version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; on Antena 3 TV, until 1991. On the same channel, she fronted the talk show &quot;Simplemente Mayra&quot;. After &quot;La Ruleta de la Fortuna&quot;, she hosted the regional show &quot;Luna de miel&quot; in 1992.

After then, Mayra&#x27;s television appearances slowed, appearing on the occasional regional show. In 1996, she hosted the medical program &quot;El ritmo de la vida&quot; on Madrid-based Canal 7. She last hosted a show in 1999 for the cookery-based game show &quot;Tomates y Pimientos&quot; (Antena 3 TV). She appeared sporadically as a talk show guest on various programs, and gave numerous interviews. She made contributions to &quot;Menta y Chocolate&quot; (Antena 3 TV), &quot;Salsa Rosa&quot;, &quot;Dolce Vita&quot;, &quot;A Tu Lado&quot; and &quot;TNT&quot; (Telecinco).

At the end of 2006, she appeared on the second season of the stand-up contest show &quot;El Club de Flo&quot; (LaSexta), winning second place. In 2007, she briefly appeared on the show &quot;A 3 Bandas&quot; (Antena 3 TV). In 2008 she appeared regularly as a guest on the morning talk-show &quot;Sin ir más lejos&quot; (Aragón TV).

In October 2009, she revealed that in January of the same year she had been diagnosed with tongue cancer, for which she had surgery. While not resulting in any threat to her life, it affected her speech, making it initially impossible for her to talk. Over the course of a year, with the help of speech therapists and specialists, she completely regained her ability to speak, albeit with a slightly affected pronunciation as an after effect of the operation.

In 2010, she began making appearances on shows on Telecinco such as &quot;Sálvame Deluxe&quot; to talk about her successful recovery from her illness. However, on February 11, 2012, she revealed on &quot;La noria&quot; that the cancer had returned, this time in her throat. On July 13, she officially announced on &quot;Sálvame Deluxe&quot; that she was cancer-free.

Gomez Kemp died from complications of a fall in Madrid, on 13 October 2024, at the age of 76.

<text>Pelit (&quot;Games&quot;) is a Finnish video games magazine published in Helsinki, Finland.

==History==
&quot;Pelit&quot; dates back to 1987, as an annual extra games-only issue of &quot;MikroBitti&quot; and &quot;C-lehti&quot;. Another annual issue was published in 1988, and in 1989 it became semi-annual (two times per year). In 1992, the staff of the semi-annual computer game book launched &quot;Pelit&quot; as a fully-fledged magazine. 

Its layout and contents have occasionally been revised over the years. Game walkthroughs were dropped as the adventure and old-fashioned role-playing games fell out of fashion. A comic, &quot;KyöPelit&quot;, was started in 1993. While the magazine started with four computer platforms, coverage of the Amiga, Commodore 64 and Atari ST was reduced as the market share for those platforms diminished. The most notable changes to the magazine format were the 1998 founding of its sister publication, the PlayStation-focused &quot;Peliasema&quot;, and the later merging of the two due to the growth of the console market and the weakening of the PC games market.

The magazine was published 11 times a year by Sanoma Magazines, a division of the Sanoma Group. The group sold the magazine to Fokus Media Finland on 1 September 2014.

Pelit&#x27;s editor-in-chief was Tuija Lindén. Its staff include Niko Nirvi and the cartoonist Wallu. Jyrki Kasvi spent several years as a game reviewer and columnist under the pseudonym &quot;Wexteen the Wizard&quot;, before entering politics and becoming a member of the Finnish Parliament between 2003–2011. Pelit&#x27;s review scores are listed on Metacritic.

The 2011 circulation of the monthly was 26,245 copies. The magazine had a circulation of 21,469 copies in 2013.

<doc id="649677" wikidata="Q3504213" url="?curid=649677" title="Super League (Australia)">
<text>Super League was an Australian rugby league football administrative body that conducted professional competition in Australia and New Zealand for one season in 1997. Along with Super League of Europe, it was created by News Corporation during the Super League war which arose following an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the pay television rights to rugby league in Australia. After two years of legal battles the competition was played for a single season in 1997 alongside the rival Australian Rugby League (ARL) competition before the two merged in 1998 to form the National Rugby League (NRL).

==History==

The Super League war was the corporate dispute that was fought in and out of court during the mid-1990s between the Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation-backed Super League and the Kerry Packer and Optus Vision-backed Australian Rugby League organisations over broadcasting rights for, and ultimately control of the top-level professional rugby league football competition of Australasia. After much court action from the already-existing ARL to prevent it from happening, Super League ran one premiership season parallel to the ARL&#x27;s in 1997 after signing enough clubs disenchanted with the traditional administration to do so. At the conclusion of that season a peace deal was reached and both Leagues united to form the National Rugby League of today.

==Teams==
Ten clubs competed in domestic competition; eight which had previously competed in the Australian Rugby League, and two new teams. The teams were:


=== Referees ===
Super League was successful in recruiting some of the best referees from the ARL. These included Bill Harrigan, Graham Annesley, Tim Mander, Steve Clark and Brian Grant.

==Super League competitions==
===Telstra Cup===

The Telstra Cup was a ten team competition held over 18 rounds. The season was dominated by the minor premiers, the Brisbane Broncos, who won 14 of their 18 matches, losing only to the Penrith Panthers, the Hunter Mariners and eventual runners-up, the Cronulla Sharks. The Grand Final was played at Brisbane&#x27;s ANZ Stadium in front of 58,912 people, the ground record for that venue. Brisbane defeated Cronulla 26–8 to win their third premiership. Auckland had teams in both the Reserve grade and two age-group Grand Finals but lost all three.

The winners in all grades were:

1st/Seniors Grade: Brisbane defeated Cronulla
2nd/Reserve Grade: Canterbury defeated Auckland
3rd/Under-19s Grade: Penrith defeated Auckland
4th/Under-17s Grade: Brisbane defeated Auckland

===Tri-series===

The Super League Tri-series was contested by New South Wales, New Zealand and Queensland. Each team played the others once, with the best two teams playing a final. New South Wales defeated Queensland 23–22 in the final at ANZ Stadium

===International matches===
In 1997 the Super League Australia team played two games against New Zealand, winning the inaugural ANZAC Test and losing the return match. At the end of the season Australia also played a three-Test series against Great Britain in the British Gas Test series. Australia won the series by two games to one. Although these matches are considered to be Tests by the New Zealand Rugby League and the English Rugby Football League, they are not recognised by the Australian Rugby League.

As News had signed up most rugby league organisations outside of Australia, the ARL was starved of international competition. They had intended playing a team of New Zealand players signed with ARL clubs but the New Zealand Rugby League took out an injunction in the Federal Court preventing the ARL from using the terms &quot;Test&quot;, &quot;Representative Team&quot;, &quot;New Zealand&quot; or &quot;All Golds&quot;. The ARL instead played Tests against rebel teams from Papua New Guinea and Fiji, as well as playing a Test against a Rest of the World team in July 1997.

The Oceania Cup was run by Super League in place of the Pacific Cup. It was contested by the Cook Islands, Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand Māori, New Zealand XIII and Papua New Guinea. New Zealand XIII defeated New Zealand Maori 20–15 in the final.

===World Club Challenge===

The World Club Challenge, which had been contested occasionally since 1975, was expanded in 1997 to include all ten Australian Super League clubs competing against all twelve European clubs. The European teams were outclassed, winning only 8 of 83 matches, and suffering many heavy defeats. The competition was unpopular in Australia, and it lost $6,000,000 due to small crowds and heavy travel expenses. The Brisbane Broncos won the final defeating the Hunter Mariners 36–12 at Ericsson Stadium, Auckland.

===Super League Challenge Cup===
The Super League Challenge Cup competition was played between the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. The Australian Capital Territory won the competition, defeating the Northern Territory 40–14 at ANZ Stadium Brisbane on 19 May 1997.

===World Nines===

In 1996 and 1997 the Super League World Nines competition was held. In 1997 the tournament was known as the &quot;Gatorade Super League World Nines&quot; due to sponsorship. Nines rugby league is a faster form of the game with only nine players per side and playing in shorter halves. The World Nines competition were held as an alternative to the ARL&#x27;s World Sevens.

The 1996 World Nines were held in Suva, Fiji from 22 to 24 February. The winner of this competition was New Zealand. The 1996 World Nines marked the first time that a video referee was used for a game of rugby league. The 1997 World Nines were held in Townsville, Queensland from 31 January to 2 February. New Zealand won this competition for the second year in a row.

==Legacy==
Although Super League damaged the public perceptions and financial standing of rugby league in Australia, a number of concepts that it introduced lived on into the new millennium.

===ANZAC Test===

An addition to the regular tests played between Australia and New Zealand, the ANZAC Test was introduced by Super League. There was some controversy at the time for the use of the word ANZAC, as many considered it inappropriate to compare sportspeople to soldiers. Although it was dropped from the annual schedule in the early years of the new millennium, it was revived in 2004 and was played annually until 2017.

===Night grand finals===
The Super League Telstra Cup Grand Final was played on a Saturday night in Brisbane, whereas all NSWRL and ARL grand finals were traditionally played on a Saturday afternoon (until 1980), or Sunday afternoon (from 1981). From 2001 the NRL has played its grand finals on the Sunday night in October (although in the afternoon/early evening between 2008 and 2012 because of television scheduling), to coincide with a public holiday in New South Wales the following day.

Although a ratings success for the Nine Network, this scheduling continues to upset traditionalists, who believe that having the Grand Final on a Sunday afternoon allows people to better celebrate the day, particularly with a Grand Final barbecue. Some in Sydney also believe that holding the grand final at night dissuades parents with young children attending.

===Video referees===
At the Super League World Nines in 1996 the video referee was used for the first time. The Video referee allows an official to check the veracity of tries scored using footage from the television broadcasters. The NRL used Video Referees from its first season in 1998.

===Rule changes===
A number of rule changes were introduced in both the Super League and the ARL during the war that have been adopted by the NRL. Super League innovations include:
*Zero tackle rule (in a modified form).
*Scrums packed 20 metres in from touch.

An ARL rule change for the 1997 season that was adopted by the NRL and is still in force is the popular 40/20 rule. Under this rule, attacking teams kicking the ball into touch &#x27;on the bounce&#x27; from inside the 40 metres closest to their goal line, with the ball crossing the sideline inside the opposing team&#x27;s 20-metre area, receives a scrum feed. Previously the defending team received the scrum feed. The other major difference in Super League was that the scorer kicked off to the other team as opposed to the ARL and NRL rule where the scorer receives.

<text>Castleconnell (, historically &quot;Caisleán Uí Chonaing&quot;) is a village in County Limerick on the banks of the River Shannon. It is from Limerick city and near the boundaries of County Clare and County Tipperary.

==History==

The ruins of the Castle of Connell ( or originally ), from which the name of the town derives, was built on a rock outcrop overlooking the bend of the river. It was destroyed in a siege by the army of General Ginkel, fighting in support of the Williamite Army of William of Orange at the end of the 17th century. A large chunk of the castle wall now lies approximately fifty feet from the castle, thrown clear by siege cannons. A footbridge over the Shannon – built during The Emergency (1939–45) by the Irish Army under Captain Carley Owens – connects counties Limerick and Clare.

The nearby Mountshannon House was the home of John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare, who in the late 18th century was the Attorney-General for Ireland and subsequently Lord Chancellor of Ireland. FitzGibbon was opposed to relaxation of the penal laws and helped usher in the Acts of Union 1800, which resulted in the Irish parliament&#x27;s abolition. The house where his descendants lived was burnt to the ground by the IRA in the 1920s.

A number of 18th- and 19th-century buildings overlook the Shannon in Castleconnell. One of these, the former schoolhouse (built in 1867), was previously home to the Irish Harp Centre. Another, the former convent (built ), is now the Castleoaks House Hotel.

==Fishing==
Castleconnell is known for its fishing – both coarse and game – and has been a fishing destination since at least the 19th century. The main catch was salmon and trout. The Shannon Inn, a local pub, has hosted fishing clientele over the years.

The Shannon Electricity Scheme and its Ardnacrusha dam at Parteen changed the fortunes of the Castleconnell in the 1930s when it reduced the flow of water south of the dam to approximately one sixth, dropping water levels along the Shannon.

The engineers added a fish lift to the dam, allowing fish to be lifted in a water-filled container and thereby pass upstream to their traditional spawning beds. The river at Castleconnell is also known for its bird life, and particularly its swans, many of which are migratory Icelandic whooper swans wintering and breeding on the river.

==Sport==
===Gaelic games===
Castleconnell is the home of Ahane GAA club, which has won 19 Limerick Senior Hurling Championships between 1931 and 1948 and provided many of the Limerick hurling team that won All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championships in 1934, 1936 and 1940. Among its most notable players were Mick Mackey and Jackie Power.

===Boxing===
Boxer Andy Lee was raised in Castleconnell from the age of 14. He became World WBO Middleweight champion in 2014.

===Rowing===
Castleconnell boat club has been in existence since 1983. It is located at World&#x27;s End (also known as Worral&#x27;s End). Rowers have a smooth, wide water to row on for to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bridge. Just beyond the bridge, rowers have another 1.5 kilometers before they come to a water flow regulator.

==Transport==
Castleconnell railway station opened on 8 August 1858. The station lies on the Limerick–Ballybrophy railway line.

==Administration==
The town was previously under the jurisdiction of Limerick County Council. Since 2014, it is part of the amalgamated local authority of Limerick City and County Council, where it is in the local electoral area of Limerick City East, which is part of the Metropolitan District of Limerick City.

<doc id="649681" wikidata="Q1920700" url="?curid=649681" title="Santana (1969 album)">
<text>Santana is the debut studio album by American Latin rock band Santana, released on August 22, 1969, by Columbia Records. Over half of the album&#x27;s length is composed of instrumental music, recorded by what was originally a purely free-form jam band. At the suggestion of manager Bill Graham, the band took to writing more conventional songs for more impact, but managed to retain the essence of improvisation in the music.

The album was destined to be a major release, given a boost by the band&#x27;s performance at the Woodstock Festival earlier that August. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Jingo&quot;, was only a modest performer, spending eight weeks on the chart and reaching #56; however, &quot;Evil Ways&quot;, the second single taken from the album, was a U.S. Top 10 hit, reaching #9 and spending thirteen weeks on the chart. The album spent more than two years (108 weeks) on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 pop album chart and peaked at #4 in November 1969. It also reached #26 on the UK Albums Chart. It has been mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. The album cover features artwork by Lee Conklin.

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Langdon Winner panned &quot;Santana&quot; as &quot;a masterpiece of hollow techniques&quot; and &quot;a speed freak&#x27;s delight - fast, pounding, frantic music with no real content&quot;. He compared the music&#x27;s effect to methedrine, which &quot;gives a high with no meaning&quot;, finding Rolie and Santana&#x27;s playing repetitively unimaginative, amidst a monotony of incompetent rhythms and inconsequential lyrics. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau shared Winner&#x27;s sentiment in his &quot;unreconstructed opposition to the methedrine school of American music. A lot of noise&quot;.

A retrospective &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review was more enthusiastic, finding &quot;Santana&quot; &quot;thrilling ... with ambition, soul and absolute conviction - every moment played straight from the heart&quot;. In 2003, the magazine ranked &quot;Santana&quot; number 150 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, moving up to 149 in a 2012 revised list. Colin Larkin deemed it an excellent example of Latin rock in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2011).

<doc id="649687" wikidata="Q231348" url="?curid=649687" title="Iván Córdoba">
<text>Iván Ramiro Córdoba Sepúlveda (, born 11 August 1976) is a Colombian former professional footballer who played as a defender. He began his career in Colombia with Deportivo Rionegro and Atlético Nacional, before moving to Argentine club San Lorenzo. In 2000, he joined Italian side Inter Milan, where he spent most of his career, remaining with the club until his retirement in 2012. At international level, Córdoba played for the Colombia national team, and represented his nation at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, and four editions of the Copa América, winning the tournament in 2001, where he scored the winning goal in the final. He was the vice-captain of Inter Milan and has also served as captain for his country&#x27;s national team.

==Club career==
Córdoba made his debut with the Colombian Serie B team Deportivo Rionegro in 1993, his wonderful performances earned him a transfer to Colombian heavyweights Atlético Nacional in 1996. He made his name playing for San Lorenzo in Argentina from 1998 but signed for Italian side Inter Milan the winter transfer window, January 2000, costing the club €16 million, rejecting another offer from Real Madrid in doing so. He has become a mainstay of the Inter Milan defence for several years, forming a highly effective partnership in central defence with Marco Materazzi. His long career at Inter led him to be named the club&#x27;s vice-captain behind Javier Zanetti; because of this, he had the honour of lifting the Coppa Italia in 2005 when Zanetti was absent due to his involvement in the Confederations Cup with Argentina.

On 19 February 2008, Córdoba injured his left anterior cruciate ligament during the Champions League round of 16 fixture against Liverpool, resulting in having to sit out the rest of the season as Inter won the league title for the third consecutive year. On 9 June 2008 he renewed his contract until 30 June 2012 with Inter, ensuring that he would effectively finish his career with Inter.

On 5 May 2012, Córdoba announced that he would leave Inter at the end of the season. A day later, Córdoba was brought on in the 84th minute of the Derby della Madonnina, making his last competitive appearance in an Inter shirt after 13 years in the San Siro; during the match (the club&#x27;s last home game of the 2011–12 season), Inter&#x27;s players wore the Córdoba #2 shirt while warming up before the kick-off. In May, he traveled with 18 other Inter players (with Dellafiore an exception) to Indonesia for a friendly tour, before ending his career.

In total, he won five Serie A championships, four Coppa Italia titles, three Supercoppa Italiana titles, one UEFA Champions League, and one FIFA Club World Cup with Inter.

==International career==
Córdoba captained Colombia to win the 2001 Copa América competition, scoring the only goal in the final. Córdoba also was called up for his country at the 1998 World Cup (taking shirt number 2 from Andrés Escobar who was murdered in the previous tournament) without appearing in a match, the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup (where they finished in fourth place), and in three other editions of the Copa América (1997, 1999, and 2007).

==Post-playing career==
On 10 February 2021, Córdoba was announced as the new sporting director of Italian Serie B club Venezia.

==Style of play==
Usually a central defender, Córdoba was an experienced and extremely fast, energetic, versatile, and athletic defender, who relied mostly on his pace, stamina, man-marking ability and timing, which made him difficult to beat in one on one situations; due to his characteristics, he was also capable of playing as a full back or wing-back on the right flank on occasion. Despite being only 173 centimeters tall, he was also a good jumper and an accurate header of the ball, and had a penchant for scoring goals with his head. Throughout his career, Córdoba also stood out for his leadership in addition to his ability as a footballer.

<text>The Sand River (French: &quot;Rivière Sand&quot;) is a river in the Unorganized North Part of Algoma District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Great Lakes Basin, is a tributary of Lake Superior, and its entire course lies within Lake Superior Provincial Park.

The river is named after the sand bar formed across its mouth. The Ojibway name for the river is &quot;Pinguisibi&quot;, where &quot;pingui&quot; means &quot;fine white sand&quot; and &quot;sibi&quot; means &quot;river&quot;.

==Course==
The Sand River begins at Sand Lake, in geographic Stoney Township, on which is located the railway point of Sand Lake on the Algoma Central Railway. It leaves the lake South over Sand Lake Dam about west of the community of Millwood. It travels South into geographic Barnes Township, geographic Barager Township, and geographic Broome Township, the latter in which it heads over Calwin Falls. The river continues south into geographic Goodwillie Township, flows over Lady Evelyn Falls, and takes in the left tributary Kwagama Creek. It then heads southwest, descends a series of low cascades, passes under Ontario Highway 17 and reaches its mouth at Lake Superior.

==Recreation==
The entire river is a designated canoe route. There is a picnic area at the mouth of the river next to Highway 17 where many travelers stop to enjoy a view of the cascading falls, and the Pinguisibi hiking trail follows the right bank from the river mouth.

<doc id="649702" wikidata="Q336286" url="?curid=649702" title="Defender (association football)">
<text>In the sport of association football, a defender is an outfield player whose primary role is to stop attacks during the game and prevent the opposition from scoring.

Defenders fall into four main categories: centre-backs, full-backs, sweepers, and wing-backs. The centre-back and full-back positions are most common in modern formations. The sweeper and wing-back roles are more specialised, often limited to certain formations dependent on the manager&#x27;s style of play and tactics.

==Centre-back==
The centre-back (also known as a central defender or centre-half, as the modern role of the centre-back arose from the centre-half position) defends in the area directly in front of the goal and tries to prevent opposing players, particularly centre-forwards, from scoring. Centre-backs accomplish this by blocking shots, tackling, intercepting passes, contesting headers and marking forwards to discourage the opposing team from passing to them. Centre-backs are often tall and positioned for their ability to win duels in the air. In the modern game, most teams employ two or three centre-backs in front of the goalkeeper. The 4–2–3–1, 4–3–3, and 4–4–2 formations all use two centre-backs.

In possession of the ball, centre-backs are generally expected to make long and pinpoint passes to their teammates, or to kick unaimed long balls down the field. For example, a clearance is a long unaimed kick intended to move the ball as far as possible from the defender&#x27;s goal. Due to the many skills centre-backs are required to possess in the modern game, many successful contemporary central-defensive partnerships have involved pairing a more physical defender with a defender who is quicker, more comfortable in possession and capable of playing the ball out from the back; examples of such pairings have included Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique for Barcelona and Spain, David Luiz, Gary Cahill, John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho with Chelsea, Sergio Ramos, Raphaël Varane or Pepe with Real Madrid, Diego Godín and José María Giménez with Atlético Madrid and Uruguay, Nemanja Vidić and Rio Ferdinand with Manchester United, or Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci, Andrea Barzagli and Medhi Benatia with Juventus.

Under normal circumstances, centre-backs are unlikely to score goals. However, when their team takes a corner kick or other set pieces, centre-backs may move forward to the opponents&#x27; penalty area; if the ball is passed in the air towards a crowd of players near the goal, then the heading ability of a centre-back is useful when trying to score. In this case, other defenders or midfielders will temporarily move into the centre-back positions.

There are two main defensive strategies used by defensive lines: the zonal defence, where each centre-back covers a specific area of the pitch; and man-to-man marking, where each centre-back has the job of tracking a particular opposition player. In the now obsolete man–to–man marking systems such as &quot;catenaccio&quot;, as well as the &quot;zona mista&quot; strategy that later arose from it, there were often at least two types of centre-backs who played alongside one another: at least one man–to–man marking centre-back, known as the &quot;stopper&quot;, and a free defender, which was usually known as the &quot;sweeper&quot;, or &quot;libero&quot;, whose tasks included sweeping up balls for teammates and also initiating attacks.

==Sweeper (&quot;libero&quot;)==

The sweeper (or &quot;libero&quot;) is a more versatile centre-back who &quot;sweeps up&quot; the ball if an opponent manages to breach the defensive line. This position is rather more fluid than that of other defenders who man-mark their designated opponents. Because of this, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;libero&quot;, which is Italian for &quot;free&quot;.

Austrian manager Karl Rappan is thought to be a pioneer of this role, when he incorporated it into his &quot;catenaccio&quot; or &quot;verrou&quot; (also &quot;doorbolt/chain&quot; in French) system with Swiss club Servette during the 1930s, deciding to move one player from midfield to a position behind the defensive line, as a &quot;last man&quot; who would protect the back-line and start attacks again. As coach of Switzerland in the 1930s and 1940s, Rappan played a defensive sweeper called the &quot;verrouilleur&quot;, positioned just ahead of the goalkeeper.

During his time with Soviet club Krylya Sovetov Kuybyshev in the 1940s, Aleksandr Abramov also used a position similar to a sweeper in his defensive tactic known as the &quot;Volzhskaya Zashchepka&quot;, or the &quot;Volga clip&quot;. Unlike the &quot;verrou&quot;, his system was not as flexible and was a development of the WM rather than the 2–3–5, but it also featured one of the half-backs dropping deep; this allowed the defensive centre-half to sweep in behind the full-backs.

In Italy, the &quot;libero&quot; position was popularised by Nereo Rocco&#x27;s and Helenio Herrera&#x27;s use of &quot;catenaccio&quot;. The current Italian term for this position, &quot;libero&quot;, which is thought to have been coined by Gianni Brera, originated from the original Italian description for this role &quot;libero da impegni di marcatura&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;free from man-marking tasks&quot;); it was also known as the &quot;battitore libero&quot; (&quot;free hitter&quot;, in Italian, i.e. a player who was given the freedom to intervene after their teammates, if a player had got past the defence, to clear the ball away). In Italian football, the &quot;libero&quot; was usually assigned the number six shirt.

One of the first predecessors of the &quot;libero&quot; role in Italy was used in the so–called &quot;vianema&quot; system, a predecessor to &quot;catenaccio&quot;, which was used by Salernitana during the 1940s. The system originated from an idea that one of the club&#x27;s players – Antonio Valese – posed to his manager Giuseppe Viani. Viani altered the English WM system – known as the &quot;sistema&quot; in Italy – by having his centre-half-back retreat into the defensive line to act as an additional defender and mark an opposing centre-forward, instead leaving his full-back (which, at the time, was similar to the modern centre-back role) free to function as what was essentially a sweeper, creating a 1–3–3–3 formation; he occasionally also used a defender in the centre-forward role, and wearing the number nine shirt, to track back and mark the opposing forwards, thus freeing up the full-backs from their marking duties. Andrea Schianchi of notes that this modification was designed to help smaller teams in Italy, as the man–to–man system often put players directly against one another, favouring the larger and wealthier teams with stronger individual players.

In Italy, the &quot;libero&quot; is also retroactively thought to have evolved from the centre-half-back role in the English WM system, or sistema, which was known as the &quot;centromediano metodista&quot; role in Italian football jargon, due to its association with the &quot;metodo&quot; system; in the &quot;metodo&quot; system, however, the &quot;metodista&quot; was given both defensive and creative duties, functioning as both a ball–winner and deep-lying playmaker. Juventus manager Felice Borel used Carlo Parola in the centre-half role, as a player who would drop back into the defence to mark opposing forwards, but also start attacks after winning back possession, in a similar manner to the sweeper, which led to the development of this specialised position. Indeed, Herrera&#x27;s &quot;catenaccio&quot; strategy with his &quot;Grande Inter&quot; side saw him withdraw a player from his team&#x27;s midfield and instead deploy them further-back in defence as a sweeper.

Prior to Viani, Ottavio Barbieri is also thought by some pundits to have introduced the sweeper role to Italian football during his time as Genoa&#x27;s manager. Like Viani, he was influenced by Rappan&#x27;s &quot;verrou&quot;, and made several alterations to the English WM system or &quot;sistema&quot;, which led to his system being described as &quot;mezzosistema&quot;. His system used a man-marking back-line, with three man-marking defenders and a full-back who was described as a &quot;terzino volante&quot; (or &quot;vagante&quot;, as noted at the time by former footballer and &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; journalist Renzo De Vecchi); the latter position was essentially a &quot;libero&quot;, which was later also used by Viani in his &quot;vianema&quot; system, and Rocco in his &quot;catenaccio&quot; system.

Though sweepers may be expected to build counter-attacking moves, and as such require better ball control and passing ability than typical centre-backs, their talents are often confined to the defensive realm. For example, the &quot;catenaccio&quot; system of play, used in Italian football in the 1960s, often employed a predominantly defensive sweeper who mainly &quot;roamed&quot; around the back line; according to Schianchi, Ivano Blason is considered to be the first true &quot;libero&quot; in Italy, who – under manager Alfredo Foni with Inter and subsequently Nereo Rocco with Padova – would serve as the last man in his team, positioned deep behind the defensive line, and clearing balls away from the penalty area. Armando Picchi was subsequently also a leading exponent of the more traditional variant of this role in Helenio Herrera&#x27;s &quot;Grande Inter&quot; side of the 1960s.

The more modern &quot;libero&quot; possesses the defensive qualities of the typical &quot;libero&quot; while being able to expose the opposition during counterattacks by carrying or playing the ball out from the back. Some sweepers move forward into midfield, and distribute the ball up-field, while others intercept passes and get the ball off the opposition without needing to hurl themselves into tackles. If the sweeper does move up the field to distribute the ball, they will need to make a speedy recovery and run back into their position. In modern football, its usage has been fairly restricted, with few clubs in the biggest leagues using the position.
The modern example of this position is most commonly believed to have been pioneered by Franz Beckenbauer, and subsequently Gaetano Scirea, Morten Olsen and Elías Figueroa, although they were not the first players to play this position. Aside from the aforementioned Blason and Picchi, earlier proponents also included Alexandru Apolzan, Velibor Vasović, and Ján Popluhár. Giorgio Mastropasqua was known for revolutionising the role of the &quot;libero&quot; in Italy during the 1970s; under his Ternana manager Corrado Viciani, he served as one of the first modern exponents of the position in the country, due to his unique technical characteristics, namely a player who was not only tasked with defending and protecting the back-line, but also advancing out of the defence into midfield and starting attacking plays with their passing after winning back the ball. Other defenders who have been described as sweepers include Bobby Moore, Daniel Passarella, Franco Baresi, Ronald Koeman, Fernando Hierro, Matthias Sammer, and Aldair, due to their ball skills, vision, and long passing ability. Though it is rarely used in modern football, it remains a highly respected and demanding position.

Recent and successful uses of the sweeper include by Otto Rehhagel, Greece&#x27;s manager, during UEFA Euro 2004. Rehhagel utilised Traianos Dellas as Greece&#x27;s sweeper to great success, as Greece became European champions. For Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan, Brazilian international Lúcio adopted the sweeper role too, but was also not afraid to travel long distances with the ball, often ending up in the opposition&#x27;s final third.

Although this position has become largely obsolete in modern football formations, due to the use of zonal marking and the offside trap, certain players such as Daniele De Rossi, Leonardo Bonucci, Javi Martínez and David Luiz have played a similar role as a ball-playing central defender in a 3–5–2 or 3–4–3 formation; in addition to their defensive skills, their technique and ball-playing ability allowed them to advance into midfield after winning back possession, and function as a secondary playmaker for their teams.

Some goalkeepers, who are comfortable leaving their goalmouth to intercept and clear through balls, and who generally participate more in play, such as René Higuita, Manuel Neuer, Edwin van der Sar, Fabien Barthez, Hugo Lloris, Marc-André ter Stegen, Bernd Leno, Alisson Becker and Ederson, among others, have been referred to as sweeper-keepers.

==Full-back==
The full-backs (the left-back and the right-back) locate the holding wide positions and traditionally stay in defence at all times, until a set-piece. There is one full-back on each side of the field except in defences with fewer than four players, where there may be no full-backs and instead only centre-backs.

In the early decades of football under the 2–3–5 formation, the two full-backs were essentially the same as modern centre-backs in that they were the last line of defence and usually covered opposing forwards in the middle of the field.

The later 3–2–5 style involved a third dedicated defender, causing the left and right full-backs to occupy wider positions. Later, the adoption of 4–2–4 with another central defender led the wide defenders to play even further over to counteract the opposing wingers and provide support to their own down the flanks, and the position became increasingly specialised for dynamic players who could fulfil that role as opposed to the central defenders who remained fairly static and commonly relied on strength, height and positioning.

In the modern game, full-backs have taken on a more attacking role than was the case traditionally, often overlapping with wingers down the flank. Wingerless formations, such as the diamond 4–4–2 formation, demand the full-back to cover considerable ground up and down the flank. Some of the responsibilities of modern full-backs include:

* Provide a physical obstruction to opposition attacking players by shepherding them towards an area where they exert less influence. They may manoeuvre in a fashion that causes the opponent to cut in towards the centre-back or defensive midfielder with their weaker foot, where they are likely to be dispossessed. Otherwise, jockeying and smart positioning may simply pin back a winger in an area where they are less likely to exert influence.
* Making off-the-ball runs into spaces down the channels and supplying crosses into the opposing penalty box.
* Throw-ins are often assigned to full-backs.
* Marking wingers and other attacking players. Full-backs generally do not commit to challenges in their opponents&#x27; half. However, they aim to quickly dispossess attacking players who have already breached the defensive line with a sliding tackle from the side. Markers must, however, avoid keeping too tight on opponents or risk disrupting the defensive organisation.
* Maintaining tactical discipline by ensuring other teammates do not overrun the defensive line and inadvertently play an opponent onside.
* Providing a passing option down the flank; for instance, by creating opportunities for sequences like one-two passing moves.
* In wingerless formations, full-backs need to cover the roles of both wingers and full-backs, although defensive work may be shared with one of the central midfielders.
* Additionally, attacking full-backs help to pin both opposition full-backs and wingers deeper in their own half with aggressive attacking intent. Their presence in attack also forces the opposition to withdraw players from central midfield, which the team can seize to its advantage.

Due to the physical and technical demands of their playing position, successful full-backs need a wide range of attributes, which make them suited for adaptation to other roles on the pitch. Many of the game&#x27;s utility players, who can play in multiple positions on the pitch, are natural full-backs. Two rather prominent examples are former A.C. Milan left-back Paolo Maldini and the former PSG full-back Sergio Ramos, who have played on the flanks as full-backs and in central defence throughout their career. In the modern game, full-backs often chip in a fair share of assists with their runs down the flank when the team is on a counter-attack like Leighton Baines and Trent Alexander-Arnold. The more common attributes of full-backs, however, include:

* Pace and stamina to handle the demands of covering large distances up and down the flank and outrunning opponents.
* A healthy work rate and team responsibility.
* Marking and tackling abilities and a sense of anticipation.
* Good off-the-ball ability to create attacking opportunities for their team by running into empty channels.
* Dribbling ability. Many of the game&#x27;s eminent attacking full-backs are excellent dribblers in their own right and occasionally deputise as attacking wingers.
* Player intelligence. As is common for defenders, full-backs need to decide during the flow of play whether to stick close to a winger or maintain a suitable distance. Full-backs that stay too close to attacking players are vulnerable to being pulled out of position and leaving a gap in the defence. A quick passing movement like a pair of one-two passes will leave the channel behind the defending full-back open. This vulnerability is a reason why wingers considered to be dangerous are double-marked by both the full-back and the winger. This allows the full-back to focus on holding their defensive line.

Full-backs rarely score goals, as they often have to stay back to cover for the centre-backs during corner kicks and free kicks, when the centre backs usually go forward to attempt to score from headers. That said, full-backs can sometimes score during counterattacks by running in from the wings, often involving one-two passing moves with midfield players.

==Wing-back==
The wing-back is a variation on the full-back, but with a heavier emphasis on attack. Wing-backs are typically some of the fastest players on a team, when employed. Wing-backs are typically used in a formation with three centre-backs and are sometimes classified as midfielders instead of defenders. They can, however, be used in formations with only two centre-backs, such as in Jürgen Klopp&#x27;s 4–3–3 system that he used at Liverpool, in which the wing-backs play high up the field to compensate for a lack of width in attack. In the evolution of the modern game, wing-backs are the combination of wingers and full-backs. As such, this position is one of the most physically demanding in modern football. Successful use of wing-backs is one of the main prerequisites for the 3–5–2 and 5–3–2 formations to function effectively.

Wing-backs are often more adventurous than full-backs and are expected to provide width, especially in teams without wingers. A wing-back needs to be of exceptional stamina, be able to provide crosses upfield and defend effectively against opponents&#x27; attacks down the flanks. A defensive midfielder may be fielded to cover the advances of wing-backs. It can also be occupied by wingers and side midfielders in a three centre-back formation, as seen by Italian manager Antonio Conte.

Examples of players who could and did play as wing-backs were AC Milan teammates Cafu and Serginho, Barcelona player Dani Alves, Roberto Carlos of Real Madrid&#x27;s Galácticos era, former River Plate&#x27;s defender Juan Pablo Sorín, World Cup winning German Andreas Brehme, Parma&#x27;s legend Antonio Benarrivo, Angelo Di Livio of Juventus and Italy and former Corinthians, Arsenal and Barcelona star Sylvinho.

<text>X.21, also referred to as X21, is an interface specification for differential communications introduced in the mid-1970s by the CCITT, now ITU-T. X.21 was the first digital signaling interface developed. The connector specification is defined by the ISO document 4903.

At the time, most physical layer protocols such as RS-232-C and RS-449 use analog signaling. X.21 was first introduced as a means to provide a digital signaling interface for telecommunications. This includes specifications for DTE/DCE physical interface elements, alignment of call control characters and error checking, elements of the call control phase for circuit switching services, and test loops.

X.21 normally is found on a 15-pin D-sub connector and is capable of running full-duplex data transmissions. The Signal Element Timing, or clock, is provided by the carrier (the telephone company), and is responsible for correct clocking of the data. X.21 was primarily used in Europe and Japan, for example in the Scandinavian DATEX and German circuit-switched networks during the 1980s.

A variant of X.21 can be found in select legacy applications as “circuit switched X.21”.

== Electrical characteristics ==
Electrical characteristics for V.10 and V.11 specifies voltage levels. V.10 is for unbalanced circuits, whereas V.11 is for balanced circuits.

With electrical characteristics V.11, it provides synchronous data transmission at rates from 600 bit/s to 10 Mbit/s.

With electrical characteristics V.10, it provides transmission speeds of up to 100Kb/s.

<doc id="649711" wikidata="Q2563571" url="?curid=649711" title="Vector boson">
<text>In particle physics, a vector boson is a boson whose spin equals one. Vector bosons that are also elementary particles are gauge bosons, the force carriers of fundamental interactions. Some composite particles are vector bosons, for instance any vector meson (quark and antiquark). During the 1970s and 1980s, intermediate vector bosons (the W and Z bosons, which mediate the weak interaction) drew much attention in particle physics.

A pseudovector boson is a vector boson that has even parity, whereas &quot;regular&quot; vector bosons have odd parity. There are no fundamental pseudovector bosons, but there are pseudovector mesons.

== In relation to the Higgs boson ==

The W and Z particles interact with the Higgs boson as shown in the Feynman diagram.

== Explanation ==
The name &quot;vector boson&quot; arises from quantum field theory. The component of such a particle&#x27;s spin along any axis has the three eigenvalues −, 0, and + (where is the reduced Planck constant), meaning that any measurement of its spin can only yield one of these values. (This is true for massive vector bosons; the situation differs for massless particles such as the photon, for reasons beyond the scope of this article. See &quot;Wigner&#x27;s classification&quot;.)

The space of spin states therefore is a discrete degree of freedom consisting of three states, the same as the number of components of a vector in three-dimensional space. Quantum superpositions of these states can be taken such that they transform under rotations just like the spatial components of a rotating vector (the so-called 3 representation of SU(2)). If the vector boson is taken to be the quantum of a field, the field is a vector field, hence the name.

The &quot;boson&quot; part of the name arises from the spin-statistics relation, which requires that all integer spin particles be bosons.

<text>Operation Teapot was a series of 14 nuclear test explosions conducted at the Nevada Test Site in the first half of 1955. It was preceded by &quot;Operation Castle&quot;, and followed by &quot;Operation Wigwam&quot;. &quot;Wigwam&quot; was, administratively, a part of &quot;Teapot&quot;, but it is usually treated as a class of its own. The aims of the operation were to establish military tactics for ground forces on a nuclear battlefield and to improve the nuclear weapons used for strategic delivery.

==Individual blasts==

===Wasp===

During shot &quot;Wasp&quot;, ground forces took part in Exercise Desert Rock VI which included an armored task force &quot;Razor&quot; moving to within of ground zero, under the still-forming mushroom cloud.

===Bee===

An augmented test unit from the United States Marine Corps participated in shot &quot;Bee&quot; during the March 1955 exercises.

===MET===

The &quot;MET&quot; was the first bomb core to include uranium-233 (a rarely used fissile isotope that is the product of thorium-232 neutron absorption), along with plutonium; this was based on the plutonium/U-235 pit from the TX-7E, a prototype Mark 7 nuclear bomb design used in the 1951 &quot;Operation Buster-Jangle Easy&quot; test. It produced a yield of 22kt (comparable to the &quot;Fat Man&quot; plutonium-only weapon that exploded over Nagasaki), but significantly less than the expected amount. Since it was a military effects test, the DoD specified that the device should have a calibrated yield within 10% of ratings. However, weapon designers at Los Alamos substituted the experimental core without notifying the DoD. The unexpected lower yield, 33% less than the DoD expected, ruined many of the military&#x27;s tests.

===Apple-2===


The Civil Defense &quot;Apple-2&quot; shot on May 5, 1955 was intended to test various building construction types in a nuclear blast. An assortment of buildings, including residential houses and electrical substations, were constructed at the site nicknamed &quot;Survival Town&quot; by some and &quot;Doom Town&quot; by others. The buildings were populated with mannequins, and stocked with different types of canned and packaged foods. Not all of the buildings were destroyed in the blast, and some of them still stand at Area 1, Nevada Test Site. A short film about the blast, referred to as &quot;Operation Cue&quot;, was distributed by the Federal Civil Defense Administration. The houses are still standing at , at the east and west ends of the road loop. They are stops on the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) tour.

From declassified documents dated February to May 1956, the Apple-2 shot, as part of Operation Teapot Project 35.5 &quot;Effects of Nuclear Explosion on Records and Records Storage Equipment&quot; was staged on the Nevada Test Site to determine the effects of nuclear explosions on various types of records and record storage equipment.

<doc id="649718" wikidata="Q736955" url="?curid=649718" title="Lashkar-e-Taiba">
<text>Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT; ; literally &quot;Army of the Good&quot;, translated as &quot;Army of the Righteous&quot;, or &quot;Army of the Pure&quot; and alternatively spelled as &quot;Lashkar-e-Tayyiba&quot;, &quot;Lashkar-e-Toiba&quot;, &quot;Lashkar-i-Taiba&quot;, &quot;Lashkar-i-Tayyeba&quot;) is a Pakistani Islamist Salafi jihadist organisation. Described as one of Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;most powerful jihadi groups&quot;, it is most infamous outside Pakistan. The organisation&#x27;s primary stated objective is to merge the whole of Kashmir with Pakistan. It was founded in 1985–1986 by Hafiz Saeed, Zafar Iqbal Shehbaz, Abdullah Azzam and several other Islamist mujahideen with funding from Osama bin Laden during the Soviet–Afghan War. It has been designated a terrorist group by numerous countries.

Affiliated organisations that share the group&#x27;s &quot;ideological inclinations and motivations&quot; include the Milli Muslim League, a political party, and Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), the group&#x27;s &quot;charity wing&quot;, a front for the LeT that emerged later. The group differs from most other militant organisations in Pakistan in following the Islamic interpretation of Ahl-i Hadith (which is similar to Wahhabism and Salafism), and in foreswearing attacks on the government of Pakistan and sectarian attacks on Pakistanis &quot;who have professed faith&quot; in Islam.

==Objectives==
While the primary area of operations of LeT&#x27;s jihadist activities is the Kashmir Valley, their professed goal is not limited to challenging India&#x27;s sovereignty over Jammu and Kashmir. LeT sees the issue of Kashmir as part of a wider global struggle. Once Kashmir is liberated, LeT seeks to use it &quot;as a base of operations to conquer India and force Muslim rule to the Indian subcontinent.&quot;

LeT’s ideology is fundamentally anti-Western, with the British Raj held responsible for the decline of the Mughal Empire. Consequently, LeT opposes any form of Western or British influence in Pakistan and the broader South Asian region. In its publications and on various platforms, the organization has consistently articulated its primary political goals, which include the destruction of India, Hinduism, and Judaism. The organization considers jihad a religious duty for all Muslims, with the establishment of a caliphate as its central religious and political objective.

C. Christine Fair, who has analyzed LeT propaganda since 1995, notes that the militant organization has consistently condemned what it describes as a &quot;Brahmanic-Talmudic-Crusader&quot; alliance of Hindus, Jews, and Christians, whom it accuses of collaborating to undermine the Ummah. 

Its followers are proponents of the South Asian group Ahl-e-Hadith (AeH) Islam, which is considered Salafist. 
It has adopted maximalist agenda of global jihad including attacks on civilians. The group justifies its ideology on verse 2:216 of the Quran. 

Extrapolating from this verse, the group asserts that military jihad is a religious obligation of all Muslims and defines the many circumstances under which it must be carried out. In a pamphlet entitled &quot;Why Are We Waging Jihad?&quot;, the group states that all of India along with many other countries were once ruled by Muslims and were Muslim lands, which is their duty to take it back from the non-Muslims. It declared United States, India, and Israel as &quot;existential enemies of Islam&quot;. LeT believes that jihad is the duty of all Muslims and must be waged until eight objectives are met: Establishing Islam as the dominant way of life in the world, forcing disbelievers to pay jizya, exacting revenge for killed Muslims, punishing enemies for violating oaths and treaties, defending all Muslim states, and recapturing occupied Muslim territory. The group construes lands once ruled by Muslims as Muslim lands and considers it as their duty to get them back. It embraces a pan-Islamist rationale for military action.

In the wake of the 2008 Mumbai attacks investigations of computer and email accounts revealed a list of 320 locations worldwide deemed as possible targets for attack. Analysts believed that the list was a statement of intent rather than a list of locations where LeT cells had been established and were ready to strike.

Unlike other Pakistan-based Salafi-jihadist terrorist organizations, LeT has &quot;publicly renouncing sectarian violence against other Islamic sects&quot;. While it has waged violent jihad outside of Pakistan, &quot;inside&quot; the country, the group has spent considerable effort and resources on &quot;preaching and social welfare&quot;. This along with its professed opposition to not fighting &quot;those who have professed Faith&quot; in Islam (where thousands of Muslims have been killed in sectarian attacks), has built up significant goodwill among Pakistanis, especially pious Muslims and the poor (helping to protect the group from foreign pressure on the Pakistan government to stop LeT&#x27;s killing of foreigners). Although it views Pakistan&#x27;s ruling powers as hypocrites (self-proclaimed but insincere Muslims), it doesn&#x27;t support revolutionary jihad at home because the struggle in Pakistan &quot;is not a struggle between Islam and disbelief&quot;. The pamphlet &quot;Why do we do Jihad?&quot; states, &quot;If we declare war against those who have professed Faith, we cannot do war with those who haven’t.&quot; The group instead seeks to reform errant Muslims through dawa. It aims to bring Pakistanis to LeT&#x27;s interpretation of Ahl-e-Hadith Islam and thus, transforming the society in which they live.

LeT&#x27;s leaders have argued that Indian-administered Kashmir was the closest occupied land, and observed that the ratio of occupying forces to the population there was one of the highest in the world, meaning this was among the most substantial occupations of Muslim land. Thus, LeT cadres could volunteer to fight on other fronts but were obligated to fight in Indian-administered Kashmir.

In January 2009, LeT publicly declared that it would pursue a peaceful resolution in the Kashmir issue and that it did not have global jihadist aims, but the group is still believed to be active in several other spheres of anti-Indian terrorism. The disclosures of Abu Jundal, who was sent to India by the Saudi Arabian government, however, revealed that LeT is planning to revive militancy in Jammu and Kashmir and conduct major terror strikes in India.

==Leadership==
* Hafiz Muhammad Saeed – founder of LeT and &quot;aamir&quot; of its political arm, JuD. Shortly after the 2008 Mumbai attacks Saeed denied any links between the two groups: &quot;No Lashkar-e-Taiba man is in Jamaat-ud-Dawa and I have never been a chief of Lashkar-e-Taiba.&quot; On 25 June 2014, the United States declared JuD an affiliate of LeT.
* Abdul Rehman Makki – second in command of LeT. Until his death, he was the brother-in-law of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. The US has offered a reward of $2 million for information leading to the location of Makki.
* Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi – released on bail from custody of Pakistan military – senior member of LeT. Named as one of the masterminds of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. On 18 December 2014 (two days after the Peshawar school attack), the Pakistani anti-terrorism court granted Lakhvi bail against payment of surety bonds worth Rs. 500,000.
* Yusuf Muzammil – senior member of LeT and named as a mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks by surviving gunman Ajmal Kasab.
* Zarrar Shah – in Pakistani custody – one of LeT&#x27;s primary liaisons to the ISI. A US official said that he was a &quot;central character&quot; in the planning behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Zarrar Shah has boasted to Pakistani investigators about his role in the attacks.
* Muhammad Ashraf – LeT&#x27;s top financial officer. Although not directly connected to the Mumbai plot, after the attacks he was added to the UN list of people that sponsor terrorism. However, Geo TV reported that six years earlier Ashraf became seriously ill while in custody and died at Civil Hospital on 11 June 2002.
* Mahmoud Mohamed Ahmed Bahaziq – the leader of LeT in Saudi Arabia and one of its financiers. Although not directly connected to the Mumbai plot, after the attacks he was added to the UN list of people that sponsor terrorism.
* Nasr Javed – a Kashmiri senior operative, is on the list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom for &quot;engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs.&quot;
* Abu Nasir (Srinagar commander)
* Zafar Iqbal is a senior leader and co-founder of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Born in one of the Pakistani, well-known, prosperous landlord,(zamindar) of Gujrat Sardar Ali Khan&#x27;s house. Iqbal has five brothers, the elder of whom, Allah Bakhsh Khan Khichi, has died. As Amir Hamza, informed people about the news of his death in his published newspaper and wrote an article on him by giving the title of a &#x27;golden tree&#x27;. He formed in the late 1980s with current LeT emir Hafiz Muhammad Saeed and LeT financier and senior member Mahmoud Mohammad Bahaziq. Zafar Iqbal has served in various Lashkar-e-Tayyiba/Jamaat-ud-Dawa (LeT/JuD) senior leadership positions. Zafar Iqbal has also been involved in LeT/JuD fundraising activities. Iqbal traveled to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to request financial support from former Al-Qaida leader Usama bin Laden. 
As of late 2010, Iqbal was in charge of the LeT/JuD finance department.
As of early 2010, Iqbal was also the director of the LeT/JuD education.
As of 2010, Iqbal was also the president of the LeT/JuD medical wing and secretary of a university trust created by LeT/JuD to carry out unspecified activities on behalf of the group.

==History==

===Formation===
In 1985, Hafiz Mohammed Saeed and Zafar Iqbal formed the &quot;Jamaat-ud-Dawa&quot; (Organization for Preaching, or JuD) as a small missionary group dedicated to promoting an Ahl-e-Hadith version of Islam. In the next year, Zaki-ur Rehman Lakvi merged his group of anti-Soviet jihadists with the JuD to form the &quot;Markaz-ud Dawa-wal-Irshad&quot; (Center for Preaching and Guidance, or MDI). The MDI had 17 founders originally, and notable among them was Abdullah Azzam. Azzam would be killed in a car bombing orchestrated by Khad in 1989.

The LeT was formed in Afghanistan&#x27;s Kunar province in 1990 and gained prominence in the early 1990s as a military offshoot of MDI. MDI&#x27;s primary concerns were dawah and the LeT focused on jihad although the members did not distinguish between the two groups&#x27; functions. According to Hafiz Saeed, &quot;Islam propounds both dawa[h] and jihad. Both are equally important and inseparable. Since our life revolves around Islam, therefore both dawa and jihad are essential; we cannot prefer one over the other.&quot;

Most of these training camps were located in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and many were shifted to Pakistan administered Jammu and Kashmir for the sole purpose of training volunteers for terrorism in Kashmir India. From 1991 onward, militancy surged in Kashmir India, as many Lashkar-e-Taiba volunteers were infiltrated into Indian administered Kashmir from Pakistan administered Jammu and Kashmir with the help of the Pakistan Army and ISI. As of 2010, the degree of control that Pakistani intelligence retains over LeT&#x27;s operations is not known.

===Designation as terrorist group===
On 28 March 2001, in Statutory Instrument 2001 No. 1261, British Home Secretary Jack Straw designated the group a Proscribed Terrorist Organization under the Terrorism Act 2000.

On 5 December 2001, the group was added to the Terrorist Exclusion List. In a notification dated 26 December 2001, United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, designated Lashkar-e-Taiba a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned in Pakistan on 12 January 2002.

It is banned in India as a designated terrorist group under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

It was listed as a terrorist organization in Australia under the &quot;Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002&quot; on 11 April 2003 and was re-listed on 11 April 2005 and 31 March 2007.

On 2 May 2008, it was placed on the Consolidated List established and maintained by the committee established by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 as an entity associated with al-Qaeda. The report also proscribed Jamaat-ud-Dawa as a front group of the LeT. Bruce Riedel, an expert on terrorism, believes that LeT with the support of its Pakistani backers is more dangerous than al-Qaeda.

===Aftermath of Mumbai attacks===

According to a media report, the US accused JuD of being the front group for the prime suspects of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Lashkar-e-Taiba, the organization that trained the 10 gunmen involved in these attacks.

On 7 December 2008, under pressure from the US and India, Pakistani army launched an operation against LeT and raided a &quot;markaz&quot; (center) of the LeT at Shawai Nullah, 5 km from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan administered Azad Kashmir. The army arrested more than twenty members of the LeT including Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks. They are said to have sealed off the center, which included a madrasah and a mosque alongside offices of the LeT according to the government of Pakistan.

On 10 December 2008, India formally requested the United Nations Security Council to designate JuD as a terrorist organization. Subsequently, Pakistan&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations Abdullah Hussain gave an undertaking, saying,
A similar assurance was given by Pakistan in 2002 when it clamped down on the LeT; however, the LeT was covertly allowed to function under the guise of the JuD. While arrests have been made, the Pakistani government has categorically refused to allow any foreign investigators access to Hafiz Muhammad Saeed.

On 11 December 2008, the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on JuD, declaring it a global terrorist group. Saeed, the chief of JuD, declared that his group would challenge the sanctions imposed on it in all forums. Pakistan&#x27;s government also banned the JuD on the same day and issued an order to seal the JuD in all four provinces, as well as Pakistan administered Kashmir. Before the ban JuD, ran a weekly newspaper named &quot;Ghazwah&quot;, two monthly magazines called &quot;Majalla Tud Dawaa&quot; and &quot;Zarb e Taiba&quot;, and a fortnightly magazine for children, &quot;Nanhe Mujahid&quot;. The publications have since been banned by the Pakistani government. In addition to the prohibition of JuD&#x27;s print publications, the organization&#x27;s websites were also shut down by the Pakistani government.

After the UNSC ban, Hindu minority groups in Pakistan came out in support of JuD. At protest marches in Hyderabad, Hindu groups said that JuD does charity work such as setting up water wells in desert regions and providing food to the poor. However, according to the BBC, the credibility of the level of support for the protest was questionable as protesters on their way to what they believed was a rally against price rises had been handed signs in support of JuD. The JuD ban has been met with heavy criticism in many Pakistani circles, as JuD was the first to react to the Kashmir earthquake and the Ziarat earthquake. It also ran over 160 schools with thousands of students and provided aid in hospitals as well. JuD disguises terrorist activities by showing fake welfare trusts.

In January 2009, JuD spokesperson, Abdullah Muntazir, stressed that the group did not have global jihadist aspirations and would welcome a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue. He also publicly disowned LeT commanders Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and Zarrar Shah, who have both been accused of being the masterminds behind the Mumbai attacks.

In response to the UN resolution and the government ban, the JuD reorganized itself under the name of Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Qibla Awal (TTQA).

On 25 June 2014, the United States added several of LeT affiliates including Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Al-Anfal Trust, Tehrik-e-Hurmat-e-Rasool, and Tehrik-e-Tahafuz Qibla Awwal to the list of foreign terrorist organizations.

According to Stephen Tankel, writing in 2011, despite the &quot;chorus&quot; of diplomats, security officials and military officers&quot; calling for Pakistan to clamp down on LeT, Pakistan has and will continue to resist. This is because LeT is &quot;one of the few militant outfits that officially refrain from launching attacks in Pakistan&quot;, which, with the group&#x27;s trained fighters and resources would be very bad for the stability of Pakistan if it did. Secondly, 

===Milli Muslim League===
Jamaat-ud-Dawa members on 7 August 2017 announced the creation of a political party called &quot;Milli Muslim League&quot;. Tabish Qayoum, a JuD activist working as the party spokesman, stated they had filed registration papers for a new party with Pakistan&#x27;s electoral commission. Later in August, JuD under the banner of the party fielded a candidate for the 2017 by-election of Constituency NA-120. Muhammad Yaqoob Sheikh filed his nomination papers as an independent candidate.

The registration application of the party was rejected by ECP on 12 October. Hafiz Saeed announced in December, a few days after release from house arrest on 24 November, that his organization will contest the 2018 elections.

===Name changes===
In February 2019, after the Pulwama attack, the Pakistan government placed the ban once again on Jamat-ud-Dawa and its charity organisation Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF). To evade the ban, their names were changed to Al Madina and Aisar Foundation respectively and they continued their work as before.

===The Resistance Front===

The Resistance Front (TRF) was launched after the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. Lashkar-e-Taiba leaders form the core of the TRF. TRF has taken responsibility for various attacks in Kashmir in 2020 including the deaths of five Indian Army para commandos. In June 2020, Army&#x27;s XV Corps commander Lt General B. S. Raju said &quot;There is no organisation called TRF. It is a social media entity which is trying to take credit for anything and everything that is happening within the Valley. It is in the electronic domain.&quot;

===People&#x27;s Anti-Fascist Front===

The PAFF was originally thought to be a faction of Lashkar-e-Taiba according to Indian officials. The Indian police claimed it is an offshoot of Jaish-e-Muhammad. The PAFF was created during the wake of the 2019 Kashmir Protests after the revocation of autonomy of the Jammu and Kashmir. The PAFF has claimed responsibility of many attacks in Kashmir against Indian forces.

===Influence in Kashmir===

After the Mujahideen victory against the Soviet Union occupation in Afghanistan, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Mujahideen fighters, with the aid of Pakistan, slowly infiltrated Kashmir with the goal of spreading a radical Islamist Ideology to Jihad against Indian administration in Jammu and Kashmir.

==Activities==
The group conducts terrorists training camps and humanitarian work. Across Pakistan, the organisation runs 16 Islamic institutions, 135 secondary schools, an ambulance service, mobile clinics, blood banks and seminaries according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal.

The group actively carried out suicide attacks on Indian Armed Forces in Jammu and Kashmir.

Some breakaway Lashkar members have been accused of carrying out attacks in Pakistan, particularly in Karachi, to mark its opposition to the policies of former president Pervez Musharraf.

===Publications===
Christine Fair estimates that, through its editing house Dar al Andalus, &quot;LeT is perhaps the most prolific producer of &quot;jihadi&quot; literature in Pakistan.&quot; By the end of the 90s, the Urdu monthly magazine &quot;Mujallah al-Dawah&quot; had a circulation of 100 000, another monthly magazine, &quot;Ghazwa&quot;, of 20 000, while other weekly and monthly publications target students (&quot;Zarb-e-Tayyaba&quot;), women (&quot;Tayyabaat&quot;), children and those who are literate in English (&quot;Voice of Islam&quot; and &quot;Invite&quot;) or Arabic (&quot;al-Ribat&quot;.) It also publishes, every year, around 100 booklets, in many languages. It has been described as a &quot;profitable department, selling lacs of books every year.&quot;

===Training camps===
The LeT terrorist training camps are in a number of locations in Pakistan. These camps, which include the base camp, Markaz-e-Taiba in Muridke near Lahore and the one near Manshera, are used to impart training to militants. In these camps, the following trainings are imparted:
* the 21-day religious course (&quot;Daura-e-Sufa&quot;)
* the 21-day basic combat course (&quot;Daura-e-Aam&quot;)
* the three-month advanced combat course (&quot;Daura-e-Khaas&quot;)

A 26/11 conspirator, Zabiuddin Ansari, alias Abu Jundal, was arrested in 2012 by Indian intelligence agencies and was reported to have disclosed that paragliding training was also included in the training curriculum of LeT cadres at is camps in Pakistan administered Jammu and Kashmir, Muzaffarabad.

These camps have been tolerated since inception by Pakistan&#x27;s powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency because of their usefulness against India and in Afghanistan although as of 2006 they had been instructed not to mount any operations. A French anti-terrorism expert, Jean-Louis Bruguière, in his &quot;Some Things that I Wasn&#x27;t Able to Say&quot; has stated that the regular Pakistani army officers trained the militants in the LeT terrorist training camps until recently. He reached this conclusion after interrogating a French militant, Willy Brigitte, who had been trained by the LeT and arrested in Australia in 2003.

====Markaz-e-Taiba====
The LeT base camp Markaz-e-Taiba is in Nangal Saday, about 5 km north of Muridke, on the eastern side of the G.T. road; about 30 km from Lahore, was established in 1988. It is spread over and contains a madrassa, hospital, market, residences, a fish farm and agricultural tracts. The initial sectarian religious training, &quot;Daura-e-Sufa&quot; is imparted here to the militants.

====Other training camps====
In 1987, LeT established two terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. The first one was the Muaskar-e-Taiba at Jaji in Paktia Province and the second one was the Muaskar-e-Aqsa in Kunar Province. US intelligence analysts justify the extrajudicial detention of at least one Guantanamo detainee because they allege he attended a LeT training camp in Afghanistan. A memorandum summarising the factors for and against the continued detention of Bader Al Bakri Al Samiri asserts that he attended a LeT training camp.

Mariam Abou Zahab and Olivier Roy in their &quot;Islamist Networks: The Afghan-Pakistan Connection&quot; (London: C. Hurst &amp; Co., 2004) mentioned three training camps in Pakistan administered Jammu and Kashmir, the principal one is the Umm-al-Qura training camp at Muzaffarabad. Every month five hundred militants are trained in these terrorist camps. Muhammad Amir Rana in his &quot;A to Z of Jehadi Organizations in Pakistan&quot; (Lahore: Mashal, 2004) listed five training camps. Four of them, the Muaskar-e-Taiba, the Muaskar-e-Aqsa, the Muaskar Umm-al-Qura and the Muaskar Abdullah bin Masood are in Pakistan administered Jammu and Kashmir and the Markaz Mohammed bin Qasim training camp is in Sanghar District of Sindh. Ten thousand militants had been trained in these terrorist camps up to 2004.

===Funding===
The government of Pakistan began to fund the LeT during the early 1990s and by around 1995 the funding had grown considerably. During this time the army and the ISI helped establish the LeT&#x27;s military structure with the specific intent to use the militant group against Indians. The LeT also obtained funds through efforts of the MDI&#x27;s Department of Finance.

Until 2002, the LeT collected funds through public fundraising events usually using charity boxes in shops. The group also received money through donations at MDI offices, through personal donations collected at public celebrations of an operative&#x27;s martyrdom, and through its website. The LeT also collected donations from the Pakistani immigrant community in the Persian Gulf and United Kingdom, Islamic Non-Governmental Organizations, and Pakistani and Kashmiri businessmen. LeT operatives have also been apprehended in India, where they had been obtaining funds from sections of the Muslim community.

Although many of the funds collected went towards legitimate uses, e.g. factories and other businesses, a significant portion was dedicated to military activities. According to US intelligence, the LeT had a military budget of more than $5 million by 2009.

====Use of charity aid to fund relief operations====
LeT assisted victims after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. In many instances, they were the first on the scene, arriving before the army or other civilians.

A large amount of funds collected among the Pakistani expatriate community in Britain to aid victims of the earthquake were funneled for the activities of LeT although the donors were unaware. About £5 million were collected, but more than half of the funds were directed towards LeT rather than towards relief efforts. Intelligence officials stated that some of the funds were used to prepare for an attack that would have detonated explosives on board transatlantic airflights. Other investigations also indicated the aid received for earthquake relief was used to increase fighter recruitment.

===Notable incidents===
* 1998 Wandhama massacre: 23 Kashmiri pandits were murdered on 25 January 1998.
* In March 2000, Lashkar-e-Taiba militants are claimed to have been involved in the Chittisinghpura massacre, where 35 Sikhs in the town of Chittisinghpura in Kashmir were killed. An 18-year-old male, who was arrested in December of that year, admitted in an interview with a &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent to the involvement of the group and expressed no regret in perpetrating the anti-Sikh massacre. In a separate interview with the same correspondent, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed denied knowing the young man and dismissed any possible involvement of LeT. In 2010, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) associate David Headley, who was arrested in connection with the 2008 Mumbai attacks, reportedly confessed to the National Investigation Agency that the LeT carried out the Chittisinghpura massacre. He is said to have identified an LeT militant named Muzzamil as part of the group which carried out the killings apparently to create communal tension just before Clinton&#x27;s visit.
* The LeT was also held responsible by the government for the 2000 terrorist attack on Red Fort, New Delhi. LeT confirmed its participation in the Red Fort attack.
* LeT claimed responsibility for an attack on the Srinagar Airport that left five Indians and six militants dead.
* The group claimed responsibility for an attack on Indian security forces along the border.
* The Indian government blamed LeT, in coordination with Jaish-e-Mohammed, for a 13 December 2001 assault on parliament in Delhi.
* 2002 Kaluchak massacre 31 killed 14 May 2002. Australian government attributed this massacre to Lashkar-e-Taiba when it designated it as a terrorist organization.
* 2003 Nadimarg Massacre 24 Kashmiri pandits gunned down on the night of 23 March 2003.
* 2005 Delhi bombings: During Diwali, Lashkar-e-Taiba bombed crowded festive Delhi markets killing 60 civilians and maiming 527. It claimed the attack under the pseudonym of &quot;Islami Inqilabi Mahaz&quot; (Islamic Revolutionary Front) on a jihadist website.
* 2006 Varanasi bombings: Lashkar-e-Taiba was involved in serial blasts in Varanasi in the state of Uttar Pradesh. 37 people died and 89 were seriously injured.
* 2006 Doda massacre 34 Hindus were killed in Kashmir on 30 April 2006.
* 2006 Mumbai train bombings: The investigation launched by Indian forces and US officials have pointed to the involvement of Lashkar-e-Taiba in Mumbai serial blasts on 11 July 2006. The Mumbai serial blasts on 11 July claimed 211 lives and maimed about 407 people and seriously injured another 768.
* On 12 September 2006 the propaganda arm of the Lashkar-e-Taiba issued a fatwa against Pope Benedict XVI demanding that Muslims assassinate him for his controversial statements about Muhammad.
* On 16 September 2006, a top Lashkar-e-Taiba militant, Abu Saad, was killed by the troops of 9-Rashtriya Rifles in Nandi Marg forest in Kulgam. Saad belongs to Lahore in Pakistan and also oversaw LeT operations for the past three years in Gul Gulabhgash as the outfit&#x27;s area commander. Apart from a large quantity of arms and ammunition, high denomination Indian and Pakistani currencies were also recovered from the slain militant.
* 2008 Mumbai attacks In November 2008, Lashkar-e-Taiba was the primary suspect behind the Mumbai attacks but denied any part. The lone surviving gunman, Ajmal Amir Kasab, captured by Indian authorities admitted the attacks were planned and executed by the organization. United States intelligence sources confirmed that their evidence suggested Lashkar-e-Taiba is behind the attacks. A July 2009 report from Pakistani investigators confirmed that LeT was behind the attack.
* On 7 December 2008, under pressure from USA and India, the Pakistan Army launched an operation against LeT and Jamat-ud-Dawa to arrest people suspected of 26/11 Mumbai attacks.
* In August 2009, LeT issued an ultimatum to impose Islamic dress code in all colleges in Jammu and Kashmir, sparking fresh fears in the tense region.
* In September and October 2009, Israeli and Indian intelligence agencies issued alerts warning that LeT was planning to attack Jewish religious places in Pune, India and other locations visited by Western and Israeli tourists in India. The gunmen who attacked the Mumbai headquarters of the Chabad Lubavitch movement during the November 2008 attacks were reportedly instructed that, &quot;Every person you kill where you are is worth 50 of the ones killed elsewhere.&quot;
* News sources have reported that members of LeT were planning to attack the U.S. and Indian embassies in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on 26 November 2009, to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. At least seven men were arrested in connection to the plot, including a senior member of LeT.

=== The Resistance Front (TRF) ===

The Resistance Front (TRF) is a group alleged to be a proxy organization associated with the terrorist outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Established in 2019, TRF has been accused by the Indian government of engaging in various activities that threaten peace and security in the Jammu and Kashmir region. These activities include planning attacks on security forces and civilians, coordinating weapon transportation for proscribed terrorist groups, recruitment of militants, infiltration across borders, and smuggling of weapons and narcotics. In January 2023, TRF was banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and its commander, Sheikh Sajjad Gul, was designated as a terrorist. This action followed suspicions of TRF&#x27;s involvement in the conspiracy to assassinate Kashmiri journalist Shujaat Bukhari in June 2018.

==External relationships==

===Support from Saudi Arabia===
According to a secret December 2010 paper signed by the US secretary of state, &quot;Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qaeda, the Taliban, LeT and other terrorist groups.&quot; LeT used a Saudi-based front company to fund its activities in 2005.

===Role in India-Pakistan relations===
LeT attacks have increased tensions in the already contentious relationship between India and Pakistan. Part of the LeT strategy may be to deflect the attention of Pakistan&#x27;s military away from the tribal areas and towards its border with India. Attacks in India also aim to exacerbate tensions between India&#x27;s Hindu and Muslim communities and help LeT recruitment strategies in India.

LeT cadres have also been arrested in different cities of India. On 27 May, a LeT militant was arrested from Hajipur in Gujarat. On 15 August 2001, a LeT militant was arrested from Bhatinda in Punjab. Mumbai police&#x27;s interrogation of LeT operative, Abu Jundal revealed that LeT has planned 10 more terror attacks across India and he had agreed to participate in these attacks. A top US counter-terrorism official, Daniel Benjamin, in a news conference on 31 July 2012, told that LeT was a threat to the stability in South Asia urging Pakistan to take strong action against the terror outfit. Interrogation of Jundal revealed that LeT was planning to carry out aerial attacks on Indian cities and had trained 150 paragliders for this. He knew of these plans when he visited a huge bungalow in eastern Karachi where top LeT men, supervised by a man called Yakub were planning aerial and sea route attacks on India.

====Inter-Services Intelligence involvement====
The ISI have provided financial and material support to LeT. In 2010, Interpol issued warrants for the arrest of two serving officers in the Pakistan Army for alleged involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The LeT was also reported to have been directed by the ISI to widen its network in the Jammu region where a considerable section of the populace comprised Punjabis. The LeT has a large number of activists who hail from Indian Punjab and can thus effectively penetrate into Jammu society. A 13 December 2001 news report cited a LeT spokesperson as saying that LeT wanted to avoid a clash with the Pakistani government. He claimed a clash was possible because of the suddenly conflicting interests of the government and of the militant outfits active in Jammu and Kashmir even though the government had been an ardent supporter of Muslim freedom movements, particularly that of Kashmir.

Pakistan denies giving orders to LeT&#x27;s activities. However, the Indian government and many non-governmental think-tanks allege that the Pakistani ISI is involved with the group. The situation with LeT causes considerable strain in Indo-Pakistani relations, which are already mired in suspicion and mutual distrust.

===Role in Afghanistan===
The LeT was created to participate in the Mujahideen conflict against the Najibullah regime in Afghanistan. In the process, the outfit developed deep linkages with Afghanistan and has several Afghan nationals in its cadre. The outfit had also cultivated links with the former Taliban regime in Afghanistan and also with Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network. Lashkar-e-Taiba is also a Punjabi group, but its Ahl-e Hadith faith (Salafi) and close relationship with the Pakistani military establishment have contributed to a historically rocky relationship with Deobandi militant groups and other Anti-Salafi Taliban elements, thus, the Taliban has a less ideological interest in letting LeT operate from Afghan soil. Even while refraining from openly displaying these links, the LeT office in Muridke was reportedly used as a transit camp for third country recruits heading for Afghanistan.

Guantanamo detainee Khalid Bin Abdullah Mishal Thamer Al Hameydani&#x27;s Combatant Status Review Tribunal said that he had received training via Lashkar-e-Taiba.

Lashkar-e-Taiba&#x27;s directed attacks against Indian targets in Afghanistan. Three major attacks occurred against Indian government employees and private workers in Afghanistan.

The Combatant Status Review Tribunals of Taj Mohammed and Rafiq Bin Bashir Bin Jalud Al Hami, and the Administrative Review Board hearing of Abdullah Mujahid and Zia Ul Shah allege that they too were members or former members of Lashkar-e-Taiba.

===Links with other militant groups===
While the primary focus for the Lashkar is the operations in Indian Kashmir, it has frequently provided support to other international terrorist groups. Primary among these is the al-Qaeda Network in Afghanistan. LeT members also have been reported to have engaged in conflicts in the Philippines, Bosnia, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also allegations that members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam conducted arms transfers and made deals with LeT in the early 1990s.

====Al-Qaeda====
* The Lashkar is claimed to have operated a military camp in post–11 September Afghanistan, and extending support to the ousted Taliban regime. The outfit had claimed that it had assisted the Taliban militia and Osama bin Laden&#x27;s al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan during November and December 2002 in their fight against the US-aided Northern Alliance.
* A leading al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah, who became operational chief of al-Qaeda after the death of Mohammed Atef, was caught in a Lashkar safehouse at Faisalabad in Pakistan.
* A news report in the aftermath of 11 September attacks in the U.S. has indicated that the outfit provides individuals for the outer circle of bin Laden&#x27;s personal security.
* Other notable al-Qaeda operatives said to have received instruction and training in LeT camps include David Hicks, Richard Reid and Dhiren Barot.

====Jaish-e-Mohammed====
News reports, citing security forces, said that the latter suspect that on 13 December 2001 attack on India&#x27;s Parliament in New Delhi, a joint group from the LeT and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) were involved. The attack precipitated the 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff.

====Hizb-ul-Mujahideen====
The Lashkar is reported to have conducted several of its major operations in tandem with the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.They conducted various operations together and it&#x27;s believed that they still work together in J &amp; K.

====Ties to attacks in the United States====
* The Markaz campus at Muridke in Lahore, its headquarters, was used as a hide-out for both Ramzi Yousef, involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and Mir Aimal Kansi, convicted and executed for the January 1993 killing of two Central Intelligence Agency officers outside the agency&#x27;s headquarters in Langley, Virginia.
* A group of men dubbed the Virginia Jihad Network attended LeT training camps and were convicted in 2006 of conspiring to provide material support to the LeT. The leader of the group, Ali al-Timimi, urged the men to attend the LeT camps and to &quot;go abroad to join the mujahideen engaged in jihad in Afghanistan.&quot; The men also trained with weapons in Virginia.
* Two U.S. citizens, Syed Haris Ahmed and Ehsanul Sadequee were arrested in 2006 for attempting to join LeT. Ahmed traveled to Pakistan in July 2005 to attend a terrorist training camp and join LeT. The men also shot videos of U.S. landmarks in the Washington, D.C. area for potential terrorist attacks. They were convicted in Atlanta during the summer of 2009 for conspiring to provide material support to terrorists.
* U.S. citizen Ahmad Abousamra was indicted in November 2009 for providing material support to terrorists. He allegedly went to Pakistan in 2002 to join the Taliban and LeT, but failed. The F.B.I. issued a $50,000 reward for his capture on 3 October 2012.

<text>An aside is a dramatic device in which a character speaks to the audience. By convention, the audience is to realize that the character&#x27;s speech is unheard by the other characters on stage. It may be addressed to the audience expressly (in character or out) or represent an unspoken thought. An aside is usually a brief comment rather than a speech, such as a monologue or soliloquy. 

The aside was used by Ian Richardson&#x27;s character Francis Urquhart in the 1990 BBC mini-series &quot;House of Cards&quot;, as well as by Kevin Spacey&#x27;s character Frank Underwood in the 2013 Netflix original series of the same name. It can be used to explain the often complex politics on the show, describe what the character&#x27;s plans/emotions are or simply for humorous effect.

It was also used by Michaela Coel’s character Tracey in the Channel 4 comedy series &quot;Chewing Gum&quot;; and by the titular character in &quot;Fleabag&quot;, written and played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.

<text>In mathematics, a cubic plane curve is a plane algebraic curve defined by a cubic equation

applied to homogeneous coordinates for the projective plane; or the inhomogeneous version for the affine space determined by setting in such an equation. Here is a non-zero linear combination of the third-degree monomials

These are ten in number; therefore the cubic curves form a projective space of dimension 9, over any given field . Each point imposes a single linear condition on , if we ask that pass through . Therefore, we can find some cubic curve through any nine given points, which may be degenerate, and may not be unique, but will be unique and non-degenerate if the points are in general position; compare to two points determining a line and how five points determine a conic. If two cubics pass through a given set of nine points, then in fact a pencil of cubics does, and the points satisfy additional properties; see Cayley–Bacharach theorem.

A cubic curve may have a singular point, in which case it has a parametrization in terms of a projective line. Otherwise a &quot;non-singular&quot; cubic curve is known to have nine points of inflection, over an algebraically closed field such as the complex numbers. This can be shown by taking the homogeneous version of the Hessian matrix, which defines again a cubic, and intersecting it with ; the intersections are then counted by Bézout&#x27;s theorem. However, only three of these points may be real, so that the others cannot be seen in the real projective plane by drawing the curve. The nine inflection points of a non-singular cubic have the property that every line passing through two of them contains exactly three inflection points.

The real points of cubic curves were studied by Isaac Newton. The real points of a non-singular projective cubic fall into one or two &#x27;ovals&#x27;. One of these ovals crosses every real projective line, and thus is never bounded when the cubic is drawn in the Euclidean plane; it appears as one or three infinite branches, containing the three real inflection points. The other oval, if it exists, does not contain any real inflection point and appears either as an oval or as two infinite branches. Like for conic sections, a line cuts this oval at, at most, two points.

A non-singular plane cubic defines an elliptic curve, over any field for which it has a point defined. Elliptic curves are now normally studied in some variant of Weierstrass&#x27;s elliptic functions, defining a quadratic extension of the field of rational functions made by extracting the square root of a cubic. This does depend on having a -rational point, which serves as the point at infinity in Weierstrass form. There are many cubic curves that have no such point, for example when is the rational number field.

The singular points of an irreducible plane cubic curve are quite limited: one double point, or one cusp. A reducible plane cubic curve is either a conic and a line or three lines, and accordingly have two double points or a tacnode (if a conic and a line), or up to three double points or a single triple point (concurrent lines) if three lines.

== Cubic curves in the plane of a triangle ==
Suppose that is a triangle with sidelengths formula_1 formula_2 formula_3 Relative to , many named cubics pass through well-known points. Examples shown below use two kinds of homogeneous coordinates: trilinear and barycentric.

To convert from trilinear to barycentric in a cubic equation, substitute as follows:

:formula_4

to convert from barycentric to trilinear, use

:formula_5

Many equations for cubics have the form

:formula_6

In the examples below, such equations are written more succinctly in &quot;cyclic sum notation&quot;, like this:

:formula_7.

The cubics listed below can be defined in terms of the isogonal conjugate, denoted by , of a point not on a sideline of . A construction of follows. Let be the reflection of line about the internal angle bisector of angle , and define and analogously. Then the three reflected lines concur in . In trilinear coordinates, if formula_8 then formula_9

<text>The Batchawana River is a river in Algoma and Sudbury Districts of Ontario, Canada, which empties into Batchawana Bay on Lake Superior north of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.

The name &quot;Batchawana&quot; is derived from the Ojibwe word &quot;obatchiwanang&quot;, meaning &quot;current at the strait&quot; or &quot;narrows and swift water there&quot;, and refers to the turbulent or bubbling waters flowing between Batchawana Island and Sand Point (directly east of the Batchawana River&#x27;s mouth).

A trading post was established near the mouth of the river for fur trading around 1817 or 1819 by clerks of the North West Company. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company appears to have operated a post there as well circa 1868-1869.

Batchawana River Provincial Park encompasses portions of the river, and Batchawana Bay Provincial Park, with a large sandy beach, is located just west of the river&#x27;s mouth on Batchawana Bay. The Algoma Central Railway crosses the river at the settlement of Batchewana.

North of Batchawana Bay is Pancake Bay, so named because fur traders travelling east from Fort William had only enough flour left to make pancakes.

== Batchawana River Provincial Park ==
The Batchawana River Provincial Park protects certain sections of the river and its banks, as well as some adjacent forests. It was established in 2004 and is meant for canoeing and fishing. Features in the park include wide meanders, numerous rapids, islands, shifting stream channels and a long canyon. The forests include yellow birch, white pine and eastern hemlock, that at the northern end of its range.

It is a non-operating park, meaning that there are no facilities or services.

<text>Physical Review Letters (PRL), established in 1958, is a peer-reviewed, scientific journal that is published 52 times per year by the American Physical Society. The journal is considered one of the most prestigious in the field of physics. Over a quarter of Physics Nobel Prize-winning papers between 1995 and 2017 were published in it.

&quot;PRL&quot; is published both online and as a print journal. Its focus is on short articles (&quot;letters&quot;) intended for quick publication. The Lead Editor is Hugues Chaté. The Managing Editor is Robert Garisto.

==History==
The journal was created in 1958. Samuel Goudsmit, who was then the editor of &quot;Physical Review&quot;, the American Physical Society&#x27;s flagship journal, organized and published &quot;Letters to the Editor of Physical Review&quot; into a new standalone journal&quot;,&quot; which became &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;. It was the first journal intended for the rapid publication of short articles, a format that eventually became popular in many other fields.

=== Notable articles ===

* 1964 &quot;PRL&quot; symmetry breaking papers
* First report of a functional scanning tunneling microscope (1982)
* Invention of the atomic force microscope (1986)
* First observation of gravitational waves (2016)

==Scope==
&quot;PRL&quot; covers all areas of physics. The journal is divided into the following sections:

*General Physics: Statistical and Quantum mechanics, Quantum information, etc.
*Gravitation and astrophysics
*Elementary particles and fields
*Nuclear physics
*Atomic, molecular, and optical physics
*Nonlinear dynamics, Fluid dynamics, Classical optics, etc.
*Plasma and beam physics
*Condensed matter: Structure, etc.
*Condensed Matter: Semiconductor-Electronic properties, etc.
*Polymer, Soft matter, Biological, and Interdisciplinary physics

A section before the table of contents highlights a small number of particularly notable articles in each edition.

<text>In geometry, an affine plane is a system of points and lines that satisfy the following axioms:
* Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.
* Given any line and any point not on that line there is a unique line which contains the point and does not meet the given line. (Playfair&#x27;s axiom)
* There exist four points such that no three are collinear (points not on a single line).

In an affine plane, two lines are called &quot;parallel&quot; if they are equal or disjoint. Using this definition, Playfair&#x27;s axiom above can be replaced by:
* Given a point and a line, there is a unique line which contains the point and is parallel to the line.

Parallelism is an equivalence relation on the lines of an affine plane.

Since no concepts other than those involving the relationship between points and lines are involved in the axioms, an affine plane is an object of study belonging to incidence geometry. They are non-degenerate linear spaces satisfying Playfair&#x27;s axiom.

The familiar Euclidean plane is an affine plane. There are many finite and infinite affine planes. As well as affine planes over fields (and division rings), there are also many non-Desarguesian planes, not derived from coordinates in a division ring, satisfying these axioms. The Moulton plane is an example of one of these.

==Finite affine planes==
If the number of points in an affine plane is finite, then if one line of the plane contains points then:
* each line contains points,
* each point is contained in lines,
* there are points in all, and
* there is a total of lines.
The number is called the &quot;order&quot; of the affine plane.

All known finite affine planes have orders that are prime or prime power integers. The smallest affine plane (of order 2) is obtained by removing a line and the three points on that line from the Fano plane. A similar construction, starting from the projective plane of order 3, produces the affine plane of order 3 sometimes called the Hesse configuration. An affine plane of order exists if and only if a projective plane of order exists (however, the definition of order in these two cases is not the same). Thus, there is no affine plane of order 6 or order 10 since there are no projective planes of those orders. The Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem provides further limitations on the order of a projective plane, and thus, the order of an affine plane.

The lines of an affine plane of order fall into equivalence classes of lines apiece under the equivalence relation of parallelism. These classes are called &quot;parallel classes&quot; of lines. The lines in any parallel class form a partition the points of the affine plane. Each of the lines that pass through a single point lies in a different parallel class.

The parallel class structure of an affine plane of order may be used to construct a set of mutually orthogonal latin squares. Only the incidence relations are needed for this construction.

==Relation with projective planes==
An affine plane can be obtained from any projective plane by removing a line and all the points on it, and conversely any affine plane can be used to construct a projective plane by adding a line at infinity, each of whose points is that point at infinity where an equivalence class of parallel lines meets.

If the projective plane is non-Desarguesian, the removal of different lines could result in non-isomorphic affine planes. For instance, there are exactly four projective planes of order nine, and seven affine planes of order nine. There is only one affine plane corresponding to the Desarguesian plane of order nine since the collineation group of that projective plane acts transitively on the lines of the plane. Each of the three non-Desarguesian planes of order nine have collineation groups having two orbits on the lines, producing two non-isomorphic affine planes of order nine, depending on which orbit the line to be removed is selected from.

==Affine translation planes==

A line in a projective plane is a translation line if the group of elations with axis acts transitively on the points of the affine plane obtained by removing from the plane . A projective plane with a translation line is called a translation plane and the affine plane obtained by removing the translation line is called an affine translation plane. While in general it is often easier to work with projective planes, in this context the affine planes are preferred and several authors simply use the term translation plane to mean affine translation plane.

An alternate view of affine translation planes can be obtained as follows: Let be a -dimensional vector space over a field . A spread of is a set of -dimensional subspaces of that partition the non-zero vectors of . The members of are called the components of the spread and if and are distinct components then . Let be the incidence structure whose points are the vectors of and whose lines are the cosets of components, that is, sets of the form where is a vector of and is a component of the spread . Then:
: is an affine plane and the group of translations for a vector is an automorphism group acting regularly on the points of this plane.

==Generalization: -nets==

An incidence structure more general than a finite affine plane is a -&quot;net of order&quot; . This consists of points and lines such that:
* Parallelism (as defined in affine planes) is an equivalence relation on the set of lines.
* Every line has exactly points, and every parallel class has lines (so each parallel class of lines partitions the point set).
* There are parallel classes of lines. Each point lies on exactly lines, one from each parallel class.

An -net of order is precisely an affine plane of order .

A -&quot;net of order&quot; is equivalent to a set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order .

===Example: translation nets===

For an arbitrary field , let be a set of -dimensional subspaces of the vector space , any two of which intersect only in {0} (called a partial spread). The members of , and their cosets in , form the lines of a translation net on the points of . If this is a -net of order . Starting with an affine translation plane, any subset of the parallel classes will form a translation net.

Given a translation net, it is not always possible to add parallel classes to the net to form an affine plane. However, if is an infinite field, any partial spread with fewer than members can be extended and the translation net can be completed to an affine translation plane.

==Geometric codes==
Given the &quot;line/point&quot; incidence matrix of any finite incidence structure, , and any field, the row space of over is a linear code that we can denote by . Another related code that contains information about the incidence structure is the Hull of which is defined as:
:formula_1
where is the orthogonal code to .

Not much can be said about these codes at this level of generality, but if the incidence structure has some &quot;regularity&quot; the codes produced this way can be analyzed and information about the codes and the incidence structures can be gleaned from each other. When the incidence structure is a finite affine plane, the codes belong to a class of codes known as &quot;geometric codes&quot;. How much information the code carries about the affine plane depends in part on the choice of field. If the characteristic of the field does not divide the order of the plane, the code generated is the full space and does not carry any information. On the other hand, 
* If is an affine plane of order and is a field of characteristic , where divides , then the minimum weight of the code is and all the minimum weight vectors are constant multiples of vectors whose entries are either zero or one.

Furthermore, 
* If is an affine plane of order and is a field of characteristic , then and the minimum weight vectors are precisely the scalar multiples of the (incidence vectors of) lines of .

When the geometric code generated is the -ary Reed-Muller Code.

==Affine spaces==
Affine spaces can be defined in an analogous manner to the construction of affine planes from projective planes. It is also possible to provide a system of axioms for the higher-dimensional affine spaces which does not refer to the corresponding projective space.

<text>International cricket matches are played between the teams representing their nations, administrated by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The main forms are Test matches, One Day (ODI) matches and Twenty20 (T20I) matches.

Most games are played as part of &quot;tours&quot; when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. World Cups featuring several countries at once, are organized by the ICC. The ICC is also responsible for cricket games played at multi-sport events such as Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, African Games, Asian Games, South Asian Games and Pacific Games.

In addition to ICC&#x27;s administration, there are also five regional bodies, Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Africa Cricket Association (ACA), ICC Europe, ICC Americas and ICC East Asia-Pacific which aim to promote the sport of cricket in their respective regions.

== History ==
There was no formal structure for international cricket until the early 20th century. In 1744, the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; were codified for the first time and then amended with new additions such as lbw and middle stump. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), founded in 1787; immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made periodic revisions and recodifications subsequently. The first international match was contested in 1844 between teams representing the United States and Canada, at St George&#x27;s Cricket Club in New York. The ICC founded in 1909 as the Imperial Cricket Conference, overtook the governance of international cricket since, although the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; have remained under the governance of the MCC.

== Tours ==
Most Test, ODI and T20I matches take place in the form of &quot;tours&quot;. Test series can last from two to six matches, but some tours consist of only a single Test. Six-match series were common in the 1970s and early 1980s, with the last six-match series to date taking place in 1997–98 season between the West Indies and England. The Ashes in England were six-match Test series between 1981 and 1997, but Australia reverted to five matches in its home series from 1982 to 1983. ODI series generally last from three to seven matches. T20I series last from one to five matches. Tours may include a multi-team one-day tournament, often referred to as a &quot;triangular&quot; or &quot;quadrangular&quot; tournament.

Sometimes, a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winning team. Some notable perpetual trophies include:

* Anthony de Mello Trophy (IND v ENG in India)
* The Ashes (AUS v ENG)
* Basil D&#x27;Oliveira Trophy (ENG v SA)
* Benaud–Qadir Trophy (AUS v PAK)
* Border–Gavaskar Trophy (AUS v IND)
* Chappell–Hadlee Trophy (AUS v NZ)
* Clive Lloyd Trophy (WIN v ZIM)
* Crowe–Thorpe Trophy (NZ v ENG)
* Frank Worrell Trophy (WIN v AUS)
* Freedom Trophy (IND v SA)
* Pataudi Trophy (ENG v IND in England)
* Richards–Botham Trophy (ENG v WIN)
* Sir Vivian Richards Trophy (SA v WIN)
* Sobers–Tissera Trophy (WIN v SL)
* Southern Cross Trophy (AUS v ZIM)
* Tangiwai Shield (NZ v SA)
* Trans-Tasman Trophy (AUS v NZ)
* Warne–Muralitharan Trophy (AUS v SL)
=== ICC Future Tours Programme ===

The &quot;ICC Future Tours Programme&quot; (FTP) is a schedule of international cricket tours and tournaments which structure the programme of cricket events for ICC full members, with an objective of each team playing each other at least once at home and once away over a period of 10 years known as the &quot;Ten Year Plan&quot;. If the cricket boards of two individual countries reach an agreement, they can play more than two series. If a team does not want to travel to a particular country for a bilateral series due to security reasons, then, by the mutual agreement of the respective boards, that series can be shifted to a neutral venue such as United Arab Emirates or any other country where the facilities are deemed adequate.

== International tournaments ==
=== ICC events ===
The main international competitions organized by ICC are ICC World Test Championship, Cricket World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy and Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup for men&#x27;s, Women&#x27;s Cricket World Cup, Women&#x27;s T20 World Cup and ICC Women&#x27;s Champions Trophy for women&#x27;s, and Under-19 Men&#x27;s Cricket World Cup and Under-19 Women&#x27;s T20 World Cup for Under-19 teams.

=== Multi-sport events ===
Cricket was originally scheduled to be included in the inaugural Olympics in Athens but was cancelled due to insufficient entries. A men&#x27;s cricket tournament was introduced as medal sport in the second Olympics but was cancelled in the following Olympics due to lack of entries. Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cricket are to be reintroduced in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. A men&#x27;s cricket tournament was played at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, a women&#x27;s cricket tournament was played at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, and both tournaments were to be included in the 2026 Commonwealth Games but was cancelled following the announcement of a streamlined event.

Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cricket were introduced in the 2010 Asian Games, were removed in the 2018 Asian Games, and were reintroduced in the 2022 Asian Games. Men&#x27;s cricket was played in the Pacific Games (South Pacific Games until 2007) since 1979, and women&#x27;s cricket was played since 2015, until 2019 and both tournaments were removed in 2023 as a result of the Pacific Games charter amendment in 2019. A men&#x27;s cricket tournament was played at the 2010 South Asian Games, and both men&#x27;s cricket and women&#x27;s cricket were introduced in the 2019 South Asian Games. Both men&#x27;s cricket and women&#x27;s cricket have been played in the SEA Games since 2017. Both men&#x27;s cricket and women&#x27;s cricket have been played in the African Games since 2023.

=== ICC qualifying competitions ===
=== ACC events ===
The Asia Cup and the Women&#x27;s Asia Cup are the only two non-ICC competitions to be featured in the ICC Future Tours Programme.

==ICC International rankings==
=== Test rankings ===
In essence, after every Test series, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team&#x27;s points total is divided by the total number of matches to give a &#x27;rating&#x27;, and the Test-playing teams are by order of rating (this can be shown in a table).

From 2002 to 2019, the top-ranked Test team was awarded with the ICC Test Championship mace and the top team at each 1 April cut-off (until 2019) was also awarded a cash prize, the winners of which are listed below. The mace is now awarded to the winners of the ICC World Test Championship.

The following table shows the test mace won by each team:
=== ODI rankings ===
The ICC Men&#x27;s ODI Team Rankings were created, and are run, by the ICC for reasons similar to the Test Rankings. The rankings are simply an international ranking scheme overlaid on the regular ODI (One Day International) match schedule. After every ODI match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team&#x27;s points total is divided by the total number of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked on a table in order of rating. The ranking does not replace the World Cup; the latter still carries much more significance to most cricket fans.

The ranking consisted two separate tables until merged into a single table in 2018. The ten ICC Full Members that play Test cricket were automatically listed on the main table while the six Associate Members with One Day International status were listed on a secondary table, but are eligible for promotion to the main table by meeting certain criteria.

=== T20I rankings ===
As with the Test and ODI Rankings, the ICC Men&#x27;s T20I Team Rankings are an international Twenty20 ranking system run by the ICC. It is simply a ranking scheme overlaid on the regular T20I match schedule. After every T20I match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team&#x27;s points total is divided by the total number of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked on a table in order of rating. This ranking does not replace the ICC World Twenty20 competition.

<doc id="649735" wikidata="Q334720" url="?curid=649735" title="Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse">
<text>During the early stages of the Iraq War, members of the United States Army and the Central Intelligence Agency committed a series of human rights violations and war crimes against detainees in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. These abuses included physical abuse, sexual humiliation, physical and psychological torture, and rape, as well as the killing of Manadel al-Jamadi and the desecration of his body. The abuses came to public attention with the publication of photographs by CBS News in April 2004, causing shock and outrage and receiving widespread condemnation within the United States and internationally.

The George W. Bush administration stated that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were isolated incidents and not indicative of U.S. policy. This was disputed by humanitarian organizations including the Red Cross, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, which stated that the abuses were part of a wider pattern of torture and brutal treatment at American overseas detention centers, including those in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and at Guantanamo Bay (GTMO). There were also 36 prisoners killed at Abu Ghraib due to insurgent mortar attacks, which provoked further criticism due to the facility&#x27;s location in a combat zone. The International Committee of the Red Cross reported that most detainees at Abu Ghraib were civilians with no links to armed groups.

Documents known as the Torture Memos came to light a few years later. These documents, prepared in the months leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States Department of Justice, authorized certain &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; (generally considered to involve torture) of foreign detainees. The memoranda also argued that international humanitarian laws, such as the Geneva Conventions, did not apply to American interrogators overseas. Several subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, including &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; (2006), overturned Bush administration policy, ruling that the Geneva Conventions do apply.

In response to the events at Abu Ghraib, the United States Department of Defense removed 17 soldiers and officers from duty. Eleven soldiers were charged with dereliction of duty, maltreatment, aggravated assault and battery. Between May 2004 and April 2006, these soldiers were court-martialed, convicted, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service. Two soldiers, found to have perpetrated many of the worst offenses at the prison, Specialist Charles Graner and PFC Lynndie England, were subject to more severe charges and received harsher sentences. Graner was convicted of assault, battery, conspiracy, maltreatment of detainees, committing indecent acts and dereliction of duty; he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and loss of rank, pay, and benefits. England was convicted of conspiracy, maltreating detainees, and committing an indecent act and sentenced to three years in prison. Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted to the rank of colonel. Several more military personnel accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted. In 2004, President George W. Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld apologized for the Abu Ghraib abuses.

== Background ==

=== War on terror ===

The war on terror, also known as the Global War on Terrorism, is an international military campaign launched by the United States government after the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitt/slogan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President George W. Bush first used the phrase &quot;war on terrorism&quot; on September 16, 2001, and then used the phrase &quot;war on terror&quot; a few days later in a speech to Congress. In the latter speech, Bush stated, &quot;Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them.&quot;

=== Iraq War ===

The Iraq War began in March 2003 as an invasion of Ba&#x27;athist Iraq by a force led by the United States. The Ba&#x27;athist government led by Saddam Hussein was toppled within a month. This conflict was followed by a longer phase of fighting in which an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. During this insurgency, the United States was in the role of an occupying power.

=== Abu Ghraib prison ===

The Abu Ghraib prison in the town of Abu Ghraib was one of the most notorious prisons in Iraq during the government of Saddam Hussein. The prison was used to hold approximately 50,000 men and women in poor conditions, and torture and execution were frequent. The prison was located on about 110 hectares (272 acres) of land 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of Baghdad. After the collapse of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government, the prison was looted and everything that was removable was carried away. Following the invasion, the U.S. army refurbished it and turned it into a military prison. It was the largest of several detention centers in Iraq used by the U.S. military. In March 2004, during the time that the U.S. military was using the Abu Ghraib prison as a detention facility, it housed approximately 7,490 prisoners. At its peak, it held an estimated 8,000 detainees.

Three categories of prisoners were imprisoned at Abu Ghraib by the U.S. military. These were &quot;common criminals&quot;, individuals suspected of being leaders of the insurgency, and individuals suspected of committing crimes against the occupational force led by the U.S. Although most prisoners lived in tents in the yard, the abuses took place inside cell blocks 1a and 1b. The 800th Military Police Brigade, from Uniondale, New York, was responsible for running the prison. The brigade was commanded by Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, who was in charge of all of the U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. She did not have previous experience in running a prison. The individuals who committed abuses at the prison were members of the 372nd Military Police Company, which was a constituent of the 320th Military Police Battalion, which was overseen by Karpinski&#x27;s Brigade headquarters.

The Fay Report noted that &quot;contracting-related issues contributed to the problems at Abu Ghraib prison&quot;. Over half the interrogators working at the prison were employees of CACI International, while Titan Corporation supplied linguistics personnel. In his report, General Fay notes that &quot;The general policy of not contracting for intelligence functions and services was designed in part to avoid many of the problems that eventually developed at Abu Ghraib&quot;.

==First reports of human rights abuses==

In June 2003, Amnesty International published reports of human rights abuses by the U.S. military and its coalition partners at detention centers and prisons in Iraq. These included reports of brutal treatment at Abu Ghraib prison, which had once been used by the government of Saddam Hussein, and had been taken over by the United States after the invasion. On June 20, 2003, Abdel Salam Sidahmed, deputy director of AI&#x27;s Middle East Program, described an uprising by the prisoners against the conditions of their detention, saying &quot;The notorious Abu Ghraib Prison, centre of torture and mass executions under Saddam Hussein, is yet again a prison cut off from the outside world. On June 13, there was a protest in this prison against indefinite detention without trial. Troops from the occupying powers killed one person and wounded seven.&quot;

On July 23, 2003, Amnesty International issued a press release condemning widespread human rights abuses by U.S. and coalition forces. The release stated that prisoners had been exposed to extreme heat, not provided clothing, and forced to use open trenches for toilets. They had also been tortured, with the methods including denial of sleep for extended periods, exposure to bright lights and loud music, and being restrained in uncomfortable positions.

On November 1, 2003, the Associated Press presented a special report on the massive human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib. Their report began; &quot;In Iraq&#x27;s American detention camps, forbidden talk can earn a prisoner hours bound and stretched out in the sun, and detainees swinging tent poles rise up regularly against their jailers, according to recently released Iraqis.&quot; The report went on to describe abuse of the prisoners at the hands of their American captors: They confined us like sheep,&#x27; the newly freed Saad Naif, 38, said of the Americans. &#x27;They hit people. They humiliated people. In response, U.S. Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, who oversaw all U.S. detention facilities in Iraq, claimed that prisoners were being treated &quot;humanely and fairly&quot;. The AP report also stated that as of November 1, 2003, there were two legal cases pending against U.S. military personnel; one involving the beating of an Iraqi prisoner, while the other arose out of the death of a prisoner in custody.

Since the beginning of the invasion, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had been allowed to oversee the prison, and submitted reports about the treatment of the prisoners. In response to an ICRC report, Karpinski stated that several of the prisoners were intelligence assets, and therefore not entitled to complete protection under the Geneva Conventions. The ICRC reports led to Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the commander of the Iraqi task force, appointing Major General Antonio Taguba to investigate the allegations on January 1, 2004. Taguba submitted his findings (the Taguba Report) in February 2004, stating that &quot;numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on several detainees. This systemic and illegal abuse of detainees was intentionally perpetrated by several members of the military police guard force.&quot; The report stated that there was widespread evidence of this abuse, including photographic evidence. The report was not released publicly.

The scandal came to widespread public attention in April 2004, when a &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; news report was aired on April 28 by CBS News, describing the abuse, including pictures showing military personnel taunting naked prisoners. An article was published by Seymour Hersh in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, posted online on April 30 and published days later in the May 10 issue, which also had a widespread impact. The photographs were subsequently reproduced in the press across the world. The details of the Taguba report were made public in May 2004. Shortly afterwards, U.S. President George W. Bush stated that the individuals responsible would be &quot;brought to justice&quot;, while United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that the effort to reconstruct a government in Iraq had been badly damaged.

==Authorization of torture==
===Executive order===
On December 21, 2004, the American Civil Liberties Union released copies of internal memoranda from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it had obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. These discussed torture and abuse at prisons in Guantanamo Bay detention camp, Afghanistan, and Iraq. One memorandum dated May 22, 2004 was from an individual described as the &quot;On Scene Commander – Baghdad&quot;, but whose name had been redacted. This individual referred explicitly to an executive order that sanctioned the use of extraordinary interrogation tactics by U.S. military personnel. The torture methods sanctioned included sleep deprivation, hooding prisoners, playing loud music, removing all detainees&#x27; clothing, forcing them to stand in so-called &quot;stress positions&quot;, and the use of dogs. The author also stated that the Pentagon had limited use of the techniques by requiring specific authorization from the chain of command. The author identifies &quot;physical beatings, sexual humiliation or touching&quot; as being outside the Executive Order. This was the first internal evidence since the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse affair became public in April 2004 that forms of coercion of captives had been mandated by the president of the United States.

=== Authorization from Ricardo Sanchez ===
Documents obtained by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and the ACLU showed that Ricardo Sanchez, who was a Lieutenant General and the senior U.S. military officer in Iraq, authorized the use of military dogs, temperature extremes, reversed sleep patterns, and sensory deprivation as interrogation methods in Abu Ghraib. A November 2004 report by Brigadier General Richard Formica found that many troops at the Abu Ghraib prison had been following orders based on a memorandum from Sanchez, and that the abuse had not been carried out by isolated &quot;criminal&quot; elements. ACLU lawyer Amrit Singh said in a statement from the union that &quot;General Sanchez authorized interrogation techniques that were in clear violation of the Geneva Conventions and the army&#x27;s own standards.&quot;
In an interview for her hometown newspaper &quot;The Signal&quot;, Karpinski stated that she had seen unreleased documents from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld which authorized the use of these tactics on Iraqi prisoners.

===Authorization from Donald Rumsfeld===
A 2004 report by the &quot;New Yorker&quot; stated that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had authorized the interrogation tactics used in Abu Ghraib, and which had previously been used by the U.S. in Afghanistan. In November 2006, Janis Karpinski, who had been in charge of Abu Ghraib prison until early 2004, told Spain&#x27;s &quot;El País&quot; newspaper that she had seen a letter signed by Rumsfeld, which allowed civilian contractors to use techniques such as sleep deprivation during interrogation. &quot;The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation... playing music at full volume, having to sit in uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques.&quot; According to Karpinski, the handwritten signature was above his printed name, and the comment &quot;Make sure this is accomplished&quot; was in the margin in the same hand-writing. Neither the Pentagon nor U.S. Army spokespeople in Iraq commented on the accusation. In 2006, a criminal complaint was filed in a German Court against Donald Rumsfeld by eight former soldiers and intelligence operatives, including Karpinski and former army counterintelligence special agent David DeBatto. Among other things, the complaint stated that Rumsfeld both knew of and authorized so-called &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; that he knew to be illegal under international law.
==Prisoner abuse==
===Death of Manadel al-Jamadi===

Manadel al-Jamadi, a prisoner at Abu Ghraib prison, died after CIA officer Mark Swanner and a private contractor (&quot;identified in military-court papers only as &#x27;Clint C.) interrogated and tortured him in November 2003. After al-Jamadi&#x27;s death, his corpse was packed in ice; the corpse was in the background for widely reprinted photographs of grinning U.S. Army specialists Sabrina Harman and Charles Graner, each of whom offered a &quot;thumbs-up&quot; gesture. Al-Jamadi had been a suspect in a bomb attack that killed 12 people in a Baghdad Red Cross facility, even though there was no confirmation of his involvement in these attacks. A military autopsy declared al-Jamadi&#x27;s death a homicide. No one has been charged with his death. In 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder said that he had opened a full criminal investigation into al-Jamadi&#x27;s death. In August 2012, Holder announced that no criminal charges would be brought.

===Prisoner rape===
Stripping prisoners of their clothes was a common form of sexual humiliation and degradation during the torture at Abu Ghraib. In 2004, Antonio Taguba, a major general in the U.S. Army, wrote in the Taguba Report that a detainee had been sodomized with &quot;a chemical light and perhaps a broomstick.&quot; In 2009, Taguba stated that there was photographic evidence of American soldiers and translators having raped detainees at Abu Ghraib. An Abu Ghraib detainee told investigators that he heard an Iraqi teenage boy screaming, and saw an Army translator raping him, while a female soldier took pictures. A witness identified the alleged rapist as an American-Egyptian who worked as a translator. In 2009, he was the subject of a civil court case in the United States. Another photo shows an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner. Other photos show interrogators sexually assaulting prisoners with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube, and a female prisoner having her clothing forcibly removed to expose her breasts. Taguba supported United States President Barack Obama&#x27;s decision not to release the photos, stating, &quot;These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency.&quot; Obama, who had initially agreed to release the photographs, changed his mind after lobbying from senior military figures; Obama stated that their release could put troops in danger and &quot;inflame anti-American public opinion&quot;.

In other instances of sexual abuse, soldiers were found to have raped female inmates. Senior U.S. officials admitted that rape had taken place at Abu Ghraib. Some of the women who had been raped became pregnant, and in some cases, were later killed by their family members in what were thought to be instances of honor killing. In addition, journalist Seymour Hersh alleged in July 2004 that the Department of Defense had in its possession videos showing male children being raped by Iraqi prison staff in front of female prisoners.

===Other abuses===

In May 2004, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported evidence given by Ameen Saeed Al-Sheikh, detainee No. 151362. It quoted him as saying; &quot;They said we will make you wish to die and it will not happen ... They stripped me naked. One of them told me he would rape me. He drew a picture of a woman to my back and made me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks apart.&quot; Do you pray to Allah?&#x27; one asked. I said yes. They said, &#x27;[Expletive] you. And [expletive] him.&#x27; One of them said, &#x27;You are not getting out of here healthy, you are getting out of here handicapped. And he said to me, &#x27;Are you married?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Yes.&#x27; They said, &#x27;If your wife saw you like this, she will be disappointed.&#x27; One of them said, &#x27;But if I saw her now she would not be disappointed now because I would rape her. &quot;They ordered me to thank Jesus that I&#x27;m alive.&quot; &quot;I said to him, &#x27;I believe in Allah.&#x27; So he said, &#x27;But I believe in torture and I will torture you.

On January 12, 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on further testimony from Abu Ghraib detainees. The abuses reported included urinating on detainees, pounding wounded limbs with metal batons, pouring phosphoric acid on detainees, and tying ropes to the detainees&#x27; legs or penises and dragging them across the floor.
In her video diary, a prison guard said that prisoners were shot for minor misbehavior, and claimed to have had venomous snakes used to bite prisoners, sometimes resulting in their deaths. The guard said that she was &quot;in trouble&quot; for having thrown rocks at the detainees. Hashem Muhsen, one of the naked prisoners in the human pyramid photo, later said the men were also forced to crawl around the floor naked while soldiers rode them like donkeys.

===Systematic torture===

On May 7, 2004, Pierre Krähenbühl, operations director for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), stated that inspection visits made by the ICRC to detention centers run by the US and its allies showed that acts of prisoner abuse were not isolated acts, but were part of a &quot;pattern and a broad system&quot;. He went on to say that some of the incidents they had observed were &quot;tantamount to torture&quot;.

Many of the torture techniques used were developed at Guantánamo detention center, including prolonged isolation; the frequent flyer program, a sleep deprivation program whereby people were moved from cell to cell every few hours so they could not sleep for days, weeks, or even months; short shackling in painful positions; nudity; extreme use of heat and cold; the use of loud music and noise; and preying on phobias.

Armed forces in the US and the UK are jointly trained in techniques known as &quot;resistance to interrogation (R2I)&quot; techniques. These R2I techniques are taught ostensibly to help soldiers cope with, or resist, torture if they are captured. On May 8, 2004, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that according to a former British special forces officer, the acts committed by the Abu Ghraib prison military personnel resembled the techniques used in R2I training.

The same report stated the following:
Historian Alfred W. McCoy, who authored a book on torture in the Philippines armed forces, noted similarities in the abusive treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and the techniques described in the KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation manual published by the United States Central Intelligence Agency in 1963. He asserts that what he calls &quot;the CIA&#x27;s no-touch torture methods&quot; have been in continuous use by the CIA and the US military intelligence since that time.

===Casualties===
A 2006 study tried to count the number of deaths by looking at public domain reports, as total figures had not been given by the US government. It counted 63 detainee deaths at Abu Ghraib from all causes. Of these, 36 occurred due to insurgent mortar attacks, others were due to natural causes and homicide.

The issue of deaths due to mortar attack received criticism. The Geneva Convention requires prisoners not be kept at facilities vulnerable to artillery attack. As Abu Ghraib was located in the combat zone, its vulnerability to such an attack had been raised early on, but ultimately it was decided to keep the prisoners there. No other US detention facility in Iraq suffered casualties due to mortar attacks.

==Media coverage==
===Associated Press report (2003)===

On November 1, 2003, the Associated Press published a lengthy report on inhumane treatment, beatings, and deaths at Abu Ghraib and other American prisons in Iraq. This report was based on interviews with released detainees, who told journalist Charles J. Hanley that inmates had been attacked by dogs, made to wear hoods, and humiliated in other ways. The article gained little notice. One freed detainee said that he wished somebody would publish pictures of what was happening.

When the US military first acknowledged the abuse in early 2004, much of the United States media showed little initial interest. On January 16, 2004, United States Central Command informed the media that an official investigation had begun involving abuse and humiliation of Iraqi detainees by a group of US soldiers. On February 24, it was reported that 17 soldiers had been suspended. The military announced on March 21, 2004, that the first charges had been filed against six soldiers.

===&quot;60 Minutes II&quot; broadcast (2004)===

In late April 2004, the U.S. television news-magazine &quot;60 Minutes II&quot;, a franchise of CBS, broadcast a story on the abuse. The story included photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners. The news segment was delayed by two weeks at the request of the Department of Defense and Richard Myers, an air force general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. After learning that &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine planned to publish an article and photographs on the topic in its next issue, CBS proceeded to broadcast its report on April 28. In the CBS report, Dan Rather interviewed then-deputy director of Coalition operations in Iraq, Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, who said:

Kimmitt also acknowledged that he knew of other cases of abuse during the American occupation of Iraq. Bill Cowan, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was also interviewed, and said: &quot;We went into Iraq to stop things like this from happening, and indeed, here they are happening under our tutelage.&quot; In addition, Rather interviewed Army Reserve Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick, who was party to some of the abuses. Frederick&#x27;s civilian job was as a corrections officer at a Virginia prison. He said, &quot;We had no support, no training whatsoever. And I kept asking my chain of command for certain things ... like rules and regulations, and it just wasn&#x27;t happening.&quot; Frederick&#x27;s video diary, sent home from Iraq, provided some of the images used in the story. In it he listed detailed, dated entries that chronicled abuse of CIA prisoners, as well as their names: &quot;The next day the medics came in and put his body on a stretcher, placed a fake [intravenous drip] in his arm and took him away. This [CIA prisoner] was never processed and therefore never had a number.&quot; Frederick implicated the Military Intelligence Corps as well, saying &quot;MI has been present and witnessed such activity. MI has encouraged and told us great job [and] that they were now getting positive results and information.&quot;

===&quot;New Yorker&quot; article (2004)===
In 2004, Seymour M. Hersh authored an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine discussing the abuses in detail, relying on a copy of the Taguba report for substantiation. Under the direction of editor David Remnick, the magazine also posted a report on its website by Hersh, along with a number of images of the torture taken by U.S. military prison guards. The article, entitled &quot;Torture at Abu Ghraib&quot;, was followed in the next two weeks by two further articles on the same subject, &quot;Chain of Command&quot; and &quot;The Gray Zone&quot;, also by Hersh.

===Later coverage (2006)===
In February 2006, previously unreleased photos and videos were broadcast by SBS, an Australian television network, on its &quot;Dateline&quot; program. The Bush administration attempted to prevent release of the images in the U.S., arguing that their publication could provoke antagonism. These newly released photographs depicted prisoners crawling on the floor naked, being forced to perform sexual acts, and being covered in feces. Some images also showed prisoners killed by the soldiers, some shot in the head and some with slit throats. BBC World News stated that one of the prisoners, who was reportedly mentally unstable, was considered by prison guards as a &quot;pet&quot; for torture. The UN expressed hope that the pictures would be investigated immediately, but the Pentagon stated that the images &quot;have been previously investigated as part of the Abu Ghraib investigation.&quot;

On March 15, 2006, &quot;Salon&quot; published what was then the most extensive documentation of the abuse. A report accessed by &quot;Salon&quot; included the following summary of the material: &quot;A review of all the computer media submitted to this office revealed a total of 1,325 images of suspected detainee abuse, 93 video files of suspected detainee abuse, 660 images of adult pornography, 546 images of suspected dead Iraqi detainees, 29 images of soldiers in simulated sexual acts, 20 images of a soldier with a Swastika drawn between his eyes, 37 images of Military Working dogs being used in abuse of detainees and 125 images of questionable acts.&quot;

==Coverage in Arts==
===Fine Arts===
* In 2004, the International Center of Photography in New York and The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh presented the photo exhibition &quot;Inconvenient Evidence&quot;.

* Photos of the scandal are shown in Alfonso Cuarón&#x27;s 2006 film Children of Men.
* War film Boys of Abu Ghraib from 2014 directed by Luke Moran.
* In the 2021 feature film The Card Counter by director Paul Schrader. The main character William Tell, played by Oscar Isaac, and Major John Gordo, played by Willem Dafoe, were previously involved in torture in Abu Ghraib.

==Reactions==

===United States===
====Government response====
The Bush administration did not initially readily acknowledge the abuses at Abu Ghraib. After the pictures were published and the evidence became incontrovertible, the initial reaction from the administration characterized the scandal as an isolated incident uncharacteristic of U.S. actions in Iraq. Bush described the abuses as the actions of a few individuals, who were disregarding the values of the US. This view was widely disputed, notably in Arab countries. In addition, the International Red Cross had been making representations about abuse of prisoners for more than a year before the scandal broke. Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s office had played a central role in eliminating limits on coercion in U.S. custody, commissioning and defending legal opinions that the administration later portrayed as the initiatives of lower-ranking officials.

On May 7, 2004, President Bush publicly apologized for the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib, stating that he was &quot;sorry for the humiliations suffered by the Iraqi prisoners and the humiliations suffered by their families&quot;. In an appearance with King Abdullah II of Jordan, Bush said he had told the king that he was &quot;equally sorry that the people that have been seeing those pictures did not understand the true nature and the heart of America, and I assured him that Americans like me didn&#x27;t appreciate what we saw and it made us sick to our stomachs&quot;. Describing the abuse as &quot;abhorrent&quot; and &quot;a stain on our country&#x27;s honor and our country&#x27;s reputation&quot;, Bush added that &quot;those responsible for the maltreatment &#x27;will be brought to justice and that he would prevent the occurrence of future abuses.

On the same day, United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said the following in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee:

He also commented on the very existence of the evidence of abuse:

Rumsfeld was careful to draw a distinction between abuse and torture: &quot;What has been charged so far is abuse, which I believe technically is different from torture. I&#x27;m not going to address the &#x27;torture&#x27; word.&quot;

Several senators commented on Rumsfeld&#x27;s testimony. Lindsey Graham stated that &quot;the American public needs to understand we&#x27;re talking about rape and murder here.&quot; Norm Coleman said that &quot;It was pretty disgusting, not what you&#x27;d expect from Americans&quot;. Ben Nighthorse Campbell said &quot;I don&#x27;t know how the hell these people got into our army&quot;.

James Inhofe, a Republican member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, stated that the events were being blown out of proportion: &quot;I&#x27;m probably not the only one up at this table that is more outraged by the outrage than we are by the treatment ... [They] are not there for traffic violations. ... these prisoners—they&#x27;re murderers, they&#x27;re terrorists, they&#x27;re insurgents. ... Many of them probably have American blood on their hands. And here we&#x27;re so concerned about the treatment of those individuals.&quot;

Other senators such as Ron Wyden said that, “I expected that these pictures would be very hard on the stomach lining, and it was significantly worse than anything that I had anticipated,”

On May 26, 2004, Al Gore gave a sharply critical speech on the scandal and the Iraq War. He called for the resignations of Rumsfeld, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, CIA Director George Tenet, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas J. Feith, and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen A. Cambone, for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of Americans abroad. Gore also called the Bush administration&#x27;s Iraq war plan &quot;incompetent&quot; and described Bush as the most dishonest president since Richard Nixon. Gore commented; &quot;In Iraq, what happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples. It was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy. The abuse of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib flowed directly from the abuse of the truth that characterized the administration&#x27;s march to war and the abuse of the trust that had been placed in President Bush by the American people in the aftermath of Sept. 11th.&quot;

The revelations were also the impetus for the creation of the Fay Report, named for its lead author George Fay, as well as the Taguba Report.

Following the outcry, Major General Douglas Stone was assigned to oversee the reform of the U.S. detention system in Iraq. Conditions for detainees were reportedly improved by the time of U.S. withdrawal.

====Media====

Several periodicals, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, called for Rumsfeld&#x27;s resignation.

Right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh contended that the events were being blown out of proportion, stating that &quot;this is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we&#x27;re going to ruin people&#x27;s lives over it and we&#x27;re going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time. You know, these people are being fired at every day. I&#x27;m talking about people having a good time, these people, you ever heard of emotional release? You [ever] heard of need to blow some steam off?&quot; Conservative talk show host Michael Savage said, &quot;Instead of putting joysticks, I would have liked to have seen dynamite put in their orifices&quot;, and that &quot;we need more of the humiliation tactics, not less.&quot; He repeatedly referred to Abu Ghraib prison as &quot;Grab-an-Arab&quot; prison.

===Iraqi response===
The news website &quot;AsiaNews&quot; quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi scholar at the London School of Economics, as saying: &quot;The reception [of the news about Abu Ghraib] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumors and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people have been talking about here the pictures are quite benign. There&#x27;s nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there&#x27;s some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point.&quot; CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush&#x27;s apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was &quot;mixed&quot;: &quot;Some people react[ed] positively, saying that he&#x27;s come out, he&#x27;s dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who say it simply isn&#x27;t enough, that they—many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from—it&#x27;s called &#x27;Dar-es-Salaam.&#x27; That&#x27;s from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party. It says that an apology is not enough for the torture ... of Iraqi prisoners.&quot;

General Stanley McChrystal, who held several command positions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said that, &quot;In my experience, we found that nearly every first-time jihadist claimed Abu Ghraib had first jolted him into action.&quot; He also said that, &quot;mistreating detainees would discredit us. ... The pictures [from] Abu Ghraib represented a setback for America&#x27;s efforts in Iraq. Simultaneously undermining U.S. domestic confidence in the way in which America was operating, and creating or reinforcing negative perceptions worldwide of American values, it fueled violence&quot;.

===Global reaction===


The cover of the British periodical, &quot;The Economist&quot;, which had backed President Bush in the 2000 election, carried a photo of the abuse with the words &quot;Resign, Rumsfeld&quot;.

The Bahraini English-language newspaper &quot;Daily Tribune&quot; wrote on May 5, 2004, that &quot;The blood-boiling pictures will make more people inside and outside Iraq determined to carry out attacks against the Americans and British.&quot; The Qatari Arabic-language &quot;Al-Watan&quot; predicted on May 3, 2004 that due to the abuse, &quot;The Iraqis now feel very angry and that will cause revenge to restore the humiliated dignity.&quot;

On May 10, 2004, swastika-covered posters of Abu Ghraib abuse photographs were attached to several graves at the Commonwealth military cemetery in Gaza City. Thirty-two graves of soldiers killed in World War I were desecrated or destroyed. In November 2008, Lord Bingham, the former UK Law Lord, describing the treatment of Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib, said: &quot;Particularly disturbing to proponents of the rule of law is the cynical lack of concern for international legality among some top officials in the Bush administration.&quot;

===Scholarly analysis===
The 2007 book &quot;The Lucifer Effect&quot; by Philip Zimbardo mentioned the abuses at Abu Ghraib to support the conclusions of the author&#x27;s 1971 psychological Stanford Prison Experiment.

In 2008, scholars Alette Smeulers and Sander van Niekerk published an article entitled &quot;Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror—a case against Donald Rumsfeld?&quot;. According to the authors, the September 11 attacks led to demands from the public that U.S. president George W. Bush take actions that would prevent further attacks. This pressure led to the launch of the War on Terror. Smeulers and van Niekerk argued that because the perceived enemies in the War on Terror were stateless individuals, and because the perceived threats included extreme strategies such as suicide bombing, the Bush administration was under pressure to act decisively in the War on Terror. In addition, these tactics created the perception that the &quot;legitimate&quot; techniques used in the Cold War would not be of much use. The article noted that Vice President Dick Cheney has stated that the United States &quot;[had] to work sort of on the dark side&quot;, and that it had to &quot;use any means at [its] disposal&quot;. Smeulers and van Niekerk opined that the abuses at Abu Ghraib constituted state-sanctioned crimes. Scholar Michelle Brown agreed.

A number of feminist academics have examined how ideas of masculinity and race likely influenced the violence perpetrated at Abu Ghraib. Laura Sjoberg, for example, has argued that the sexual humiliation of detainees was meant to mark &quot;the victory of hegemonic American manliness over subordinated Iraqi masculinities.&quot; Similarly, Jasbir Puar’s book &quot;Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times&quot; (2007) examines the feminist, queer, and American government&#x27;s response to the Abu Ghraib photographs. Puar draws upon queer theory and biopolitics, among other frameworks, in her analysis and coins the term &quot;homonationalism,&quot; short for &quot;homonormative nationalism.&quot; She discusses ideas that the soldiers’ beliefs of American cultural supremacy over the &quot;sexually repressed&quot; and &quot;homophobic&quot; Muslim detainees were used to dehumanize the victims.

==Repercussions==
===Convictions of soldiers===

Twelve soldiers were convicted of various charges relating to the incidents, with all of the convictions including the charge of dereliction of duty. Most soldiers only received minor sentences. Three other soldiers were either cleared of charges or were not charged. No one was convicted for the murders of the detainees.

* Colonel Thomas Pappas was relieved of his command on May 13, 2005, after receiving non-judicial punishment for two instances of dereliction of duty, including that of allowing dogs to be present during interrogations. He was fined $8000 under the provisions of Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (non-judicial punishment). He also received a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand which effectively ended his military career. He did not face criminal prosecution.
*Lieutenant Colonel Steven L. Jordan became the second highest-ranking officer to have charges brought against him in connection with the Abu Ghraib abuse on April 29, 2006. Prior to his trial, eight of the twelve charges against him were dismissed, including two of the most serious, after Major General George Fay admitted that he did not read Jordan his rights before interviewing him. On August 28, 2007, Jordan was acquitted of all charges related to prisoner mistreatment and received a reprimand for disobeying an order not to discuss a 2004 investigation into the allegations.
* Specialist Charles Graner was found guilty on January 14, 2005, of conspiracy to maltreat detainees, failing to protect detainees from abuse, cruelty, and maltreatment, as well as charges of assault, indecency, adultery, and obstruction of justice. On January 15, 2005, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, dishonorable discharge, and reduction in rank to private. Graner was paroled from the U.S. military&#x27;s Fort Leavenworth prison on August 6, 2011, after serving six-and-a-half years.
* Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick pleaded guilty on October 20, 2004, to conspiracy, dereliction of duty, maltreatment of detainees, assault and committing an indecent act, in exchange for other charges being dropped. His abuses included forcing three prisoners to masturbate. He also punched one prisoner so hard in the chest that he needed resuscitation. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, forfeiture of pay, a dishonorable discharge and a reduction in rank to private. He was released on parole in October 2007, after four years in prison.
* Sergeant Javal Davis pleaded guilty on February 4, 2005, to dereliction of duty, making false official statements, and battery. He was sentenced to six months in prison, a reduction in rank to private, and a bad conduct discharge. Davis had admitted to stepping on the hands and feet of a group of handcuffed detainees and falling with his full weight on top of them.
* Specialist Jeremy Sivits was sentenced on May 19, 2004, by a special court-martial to the maximum one-year sentence, in addition to a bad conduct discharge and a reduction of rank to private, upon his guilty plea. He died from COVID-19 in 2022.
* Specialist Armin Cruz was sentenced on September 11, 2004, to eight months&#x27; confinement, reduction in rank to private and a bad conduct discharge in exchange for his testimony against other soldiers.
* Specialist Sabrina Harman was sentenced on May 17, 2005, to six months in prison and a bad conduct discharge after being convicted on six of the seven counts. Previously, she had faced a maximum sentence of five years. Harman served her sentence at Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar.
* Specialist Megan Ambuhl was convicted on October 30, 2004, of dereliction of duty. She was dishonorably discharged, reduced in rank to private, and ordered to forfeit half a month of pay.
* Private First Class Lynndie England was convicted on September 26, 2005, of one count of conspiracy, four counts of maltreating detainees and one count of committing an indecent act. She was acquitted on a second conspiracy count. England had faced a maximum sentence of ten years. She was sentenced on September 27, 2005, to three years&#x27; confinement, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, reduction to Private (E-1) and received a dishonorable discharge. England served her sentence at Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar. She was paroled on March 1, 2007, after having served one year and five months.
* Sergeant Santos Cardona was convicted of dereliction of duty and aggravated assault, the equivalent of a felony in the U.S. civilian justice system. Cardona was sentenced to 90 days of hard labor, which he served at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He was also fined and demoted. Cardona was unable to re-enlist due to his conviction. However, on September 29, 2007, Cardona left the Army with an honorable discharge. In 2009, he was killed in action while working as a government contractor in Afghanistan.
* Specialist Roman Krol pleaded guilty on February 1, 2005, to conspiracy and maltreatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib. He was sentenced to ten months&#x27; confinement, reduction in rank to Private, and a bad conduct discharge.
* Specialist Israel Rivera, who was present during abuse on October 25, was under investigation but was never charged and testified against other soldiers.
* Sergeant Michael Smith was found guilty on March 21, 2006, of two counts of prisoner maltreatment, one count of simple assault, one count of conspiracy to maltreat, one count of dereliction of duty and a final charge of an indecent act, and sentenced to 179 days in prison, a fine of $2,250, a demotion to private, and a bad conduct discharge.

===Senior personnel===
* Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, who had been commanding officer at the prison, was demoted to colonel on May 5, 2005. In a BBC interview, Janis Karpinski said that she was being made a scapegoat, and that the top U.S. commander for Iraq, General Ricardo Sanchez, should be asked what he knew about the abuse. Karpinski told a reporter in 2014 that, at the time, military intelligence personnel had informed her that 75 percent of the inmates were innocent of the crimes they had been accused of and had been detained simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. She later learned that this figure was closer to 90 percent.
* Donald Rumsfeld stated in February 2005 that as a result of the Abu Ghraib scandal, he had twice offered to resign from his post of Secretary of Defense, but U.S. President George W. Bush declined both offers.
* Jay Bybee, the author of the Justice Department memo defining torture as activity producing pain equivalent to the pain experienced during death and organ failure, was nominated by President Bush to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he began service in 2003.
* Michael Chertoff, who as head of the Justice Department&#x27;s criminal division advised the CIA on the outer limits of legality in coercive interrogation sessions, was selected by President Bush to fill the cabinet-level vacancy at Secretary of Homeland Security created by the departure of Tom Ridge.
* Karpinski&#x27;s immediate operational supervisor and Sanchez&#x27;s deputy, Major General Walter Wojdakowski, was cleared of all charges, and was subsequently appointed Chief of the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning.
* Pappas&#x27;s boss, Barbara Fast, was subsequently appointed Chief of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca.

The Final Report of the Independent Panel to Review Department of Defense detention operations specifically absolved U.S. military and political leadership from culpability: &quot;The Panel finds no evidence that organizations above the 800th MP brigade or the 205th MI Brigade-level were directly involved in the incidents at Abu Ghraib.&quot;

==Legal issues==
===International law===
Since much of the abuse took place while Iraq was occupied by the United States under the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), Common Article Two of the Geneva Conventions (which governs rules applicable to international armed conflict) applied to the situation. Common Article Two states:
In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. 

The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.
The United States has ratified the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV - Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot; and the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, as well as the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Bush Administration took the position that: &quot;Both the United States and Iraq are parties to the Geneva Conventions. The United States recognizes that these treaties are binding in the war for the &#x27;liberation of Iraq.
The Convention Against Torture defines torture in the following terms:

According to Human Rights Watch:
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) concluded in its confidential February 2004 report to the Coalition Forces (CF) that it had documented &quot;serious violations&quot; of international law in connection with prisoners held in Iraq. The ICRD added that its report &quot;establishes that persons deprived of their liberty face the risk of being subjected to a process of physical and psychological coercion, in some cases tantamount to torture, in the early stages of the internment process&quot;. There were several major violations described in the ICRC report. These included brutality against protected persons upon capture and initial custody, sometimes causing death or serious injury; absence of notification of arrest of persons deprived of their liberty to their families causing distress among persons deprived of their liberty and their families; physical or psychological coercion during interrogation to secure information; prolonged solitary confinement in cells devoid of daylight; excessive and disproportionate use of force against persons deprived of their liberty resulting in death or injury during their period of internment.

Some legal experts have said that the United States could be obligated to try some of its soldiers for war crimes. Under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war and civilians detained in a war may not be treated in a degrading manner, and violation of that section is a &quot;grave breach&quot;. In a November 5, 2003 report on prisons in Iraq, the Army&#x27;s provost marshal, Major General Donald J. Ryder, stated that the conditions under which prisoners were held sometimes violated the Geneva Conventions.

===United Nations resolution 1546===
In December 2005, John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), criticized the U.S. military&#x27;s practice of holding Iraqi prisoners in Iraqi facilities such as Abu Ghraib. Pace stated that this practice was not mandated by UN Resolution 1546, according to which the U.S. government has claimed a legal mandate permitting its ongoing occupation of Iraq. Pace said, &quot;All except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison. Essentially none of these people have any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in the protection of the individual in this country.&quot;

===Torture Memos===
Alberto Gonzales and other senior administration lawyers argued that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and other similar prisons should be considered &quot;unlawful combatants&quot; and were not protected by the Geneva Conventions. These opinions were issued in multiple memoranda, known today as the &quot;Torture Memos&quot;, in August 2002, by the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the U.S. Justice Department. They were written by John Yoo, deputy assistant attorney-general in the OLC, and two of three were signed by his boss Jay S. Bybee. (The latter was appointed as a federal judge in 2003, starting March 21, 2003.) An additional memo was issued on March 14, 2003, after the resignation of Bybee, and just prior to the American invasion of Iraq. In it, Yoo concluded that federal laws prohibiting the use of torture did not apply to U.S. practices overseas. Gonzales observed that denying coverage under the Geneva Conventions, &quot;substantially reduces the threat of domestic criminal prosecution under the War Crimes Act.&quot; Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman wrote that Gonzales&#x27;s statement suggested that policy was crafted to ensure that the actions of U.S. officials could not be considered war crimes.

===Other legal proceedings===
In &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; (2006), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applied to all detainees in the War on Terror. It said that the military tribunals used to try these suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law. It said that the president could not unilaterally establish such tribunals, and that Congress needed to authorize a means by which detainees could confront their accusers and challenge their detention. At the time of the court&#x27;s ruling, the U.S. fought in cooperation with recognized territorial governments (including the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Iraqi federal government) in the War on Terror against violent non-state actors, and therefore Common Article Three was binding upon the U.S. rather than Common Article Two.

On June 27, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeals of lawsuits from a group of 250 Iraqis who wanted to sue CACI International Inc. and Titan Corp. (now a subsidiary of L-3 Communications), the two private contractors at Abu Ghraib, over claims of abuse by interrogators and translators at the prison. The suits had been dismissed by the lower courts on the grounds that the companies held a derivative sovereign immunity from suits based on their status as government contractors pursuant to a battle-field preemption doctrine.

On November 14, 2006, legal proceedings invoking universal jurisdiction were begun in Germany against Donald Rumsfeld, Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo, George Tenet and others for their alleged involvement in prisoner abuse under the command responsibility. On April 27, 2007, the German Public Prosecutor General, Monika Harms, announced that the government would not pursue charges against Rumsfeld and the 11 other U.S. officials, stating the accusations did not apply, in part because there was insufficient evidence that the acts occurred on German soil, and because the accused did not live in Germany.

In June 2011, the Justice Department announced it was opening a grand jury investigation into CIA torture which killed a prisoner.

In June 2014, the U.S. court of appeals in Richmond, Virginia, found that an 18th-century law known as the Alien Tort Statute, allowed non-US citizens access to U.S. courts for violations of &quot;the law of nations or a treaty of the United States&quot;. This would enable abused Iraqis to file suit against contractor CACI International. Employees of CACI International are being accused of encouraging torture and abuse as well as taking part in it as the four Iraqis contend that they were &quot;repeatedly shot in the head with a taser gun&quot;, &quot;beaten on the genitals with a stick&quot;, and forced to watch the &quot;rape [of] a female detainee&quot;, during their time at the prison. 

As of April 2024, an Alexandria, Virginia federal civil jury was deliberating whether to hold CACI liable for its employees&#x27; torture of three Iraqi citizens at Abu Ghraib. The case ended in a hung jury, with the majority of jurors believing that CACI should be held responsible, and a second trial began on October 30. On November 12, 2024, the federal court found CACI Premier Technology liable for its involvement in the torture and ordered CACI to pay $3 million in compensatory damages to each of the three plaintiffs, plus $11 million each in punitive damages, for a total of $42 million. Although the court found that CACI employees did not directly take part in the human rights abuses, it concluded that interrogators had instructed the military police to &quot;soften up&quot; prisoners for questioning by mistreating them.

===Military Commissions Act of 2006===
Critics consider the Military Commissions Act of 2006 an amnesty law for crimes committed in the War on Terror by retroactively rewriting the War Crimes Act. It abolished habeas corpus for foreign detainees, effectively making it impossible for detainees to challenge crimes committed against them.

==Later developments==
On October 29, 2007, the memoir of a soldier stationed in Abu Ghraib, Iraq from 2005 to 2006 was published. It was called &quot;Torture Central&quot; and chronicled many events previously unreported in the news media, including torture that continued at Abu Ghraib over a year after the abuse photos were published.

In 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An Associated Press article said 

In September 2010, Amnesty International warned in a report titled &quot;New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq&quot; that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the U.S. detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime, in which human rights abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the military forces. Amnesty&#x27;s Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say: &quot;Iraq&#x27;s security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees&#x27; rights and they have been permitted. U.S. authorities, whose own record on detainees&#x27; rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by U.S. forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights.&quot;

On October 22, 2010, nearly 400,000 secret United States Army field reports and war logs, detailing torture, summary executions and war crimes, were passed on to the British paper, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and several other international media organisations through the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. Among other things, the logs detail how U.S. authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape, and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, whose conduct appeared to be systematic and normally unpunished, and that U.S. troops abused prisoners for years even after the Abu Ghraib scandal.

In 2013, Associated Press stated that Engility Holdings, of Chantilly, Virginia, paid $5.28 million in a settlement to 71 former inmates held at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run detention sites between 2003 and 2007. The settlement was the first successful attempt by the detainees to obtain reparations for the abuses they had experienced.

In 2014, Abu Ghraib prison was closed indefinitely by the Iraqi government over concerns that ISIL would take over the facility.

In November 2024, more than two decades later, three former detainees of Abu Ghraib prison were awarded $42 million after a jury found CACI liable for conspiring with military police to inflict abuse on the prisoners.

<text>The Crozet Islands (; or, officially, &quot;Archipel Crozet&quot;) are a sub-Antarctic archipelago of small islands in the southern Indian Ocean. They form one of the five administrative districts of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands.

==History==
=== Discovery and early history ===
The Crozet Islands were discovered on 24 January 1772, by the expedition of French explorer Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, aboard &quot;Le Mascarin&quot;. His second-in-command, Julien-Marie Crozet, landed on Île de la Possession, claiming the archipelago for France. The expedition continued east and landed in New Zealand, where Captain Marion and much of his crew were killed and cannibalized by Maoris. Crozet survived the disaster, and successfully led the survivors back to their base in Mauritius. In 1776, Crozet met James Cook at Cape Town, at the start of Cook&#x27;s third voyage. Crozet shared the charts of his ill-fated expedition, and as Cook sailed eastward, he stopped at the islands, naming the western group &quot;Marion&quot; and the eastern group &quot;Crozet&quot;. In the following years, sealers visiting the islands referred to both the eastern and western groups as the Crozet Islands, and Marion Island became the name of the larger of the two Prince Edward Islands, which had been discovered by Captain Marion on the same expedition.

In the early 19th century, the islands were often visited by sealers, and the seals had been nearly exterminated by 1835. Between 1804 and 1911, 153 vessels visited the island for seals, seven of which wrecked on the coast. Subsequently, whaling was the main activity around the islands, especially by the whalers from Massachusetts. In 1841, there were a dozen whaleships around the islands. Within a couple of years, this had increased to twenty from the United States alone. Such exploitation was short-lived, and the islands were rarely visited for the rest of the century. The islands were uninhabited during the late 19th century.

There were many shipwrecks on the Crozet Islands. The British sealer, &quot;Princess of Wales&quot;, sank in 1821, and the survivors spent two years on the islands. A castaway wrote &#x27;The land affords no shelter whatever, there being neither tree nor shrub, and the weather is at most times extremely wet, and snow frequently on the ground&#x27;. In 1825 the &quot;Aventure&quot; was wrecked and 7 men survived. The &quot;Strathmore&quot; was wrecked in 1875 and 44 people survived on a small island for 7 months. In 1887, the French &quot;Tamaris&quot; was wrecked and her crew stranded on Île des Cochons. They tied a note to the leg of an albatross, which was found seven months later in Fremantle, Western Australia, but the crew was never recovered. For some time, the Royal Navy dispatched a ship every few years to look for stranded survivors. The steamship &quot;Australasian&quot; also checked for survivors en route to Australia.

=== Recent history ===
Between 1924 and 1955, France administered the islands as a dependency of Madagascar. In 1938, the Crozet Islands were declared a nature reserve. The Crozet Islands became part of the French Southern Territories in 1955. In 1961, a first research station was set up, but it was not until 1963 that the permanent station Alfred Faure opened at Port Alfred on Île de la Possession (both named after the first leader of the station). The station is staffed by 18 to 30 people (varying by season). They perform meteorological, biological, and geological research, and maintain a seismograph and a geomagnetic observatory (IAGA code: CZT). The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization has listening equipment on the island and it was disclosed that two of its stations, the other being on Ascension Island, detected what is believed to be an underwater, non-nuclear explosion off the coast of Argentina and believed to be the fatal accident of the submarine in 2017.

==Geology==
The islands lie on the Antarctic Plate, roughly between the Kerguelen hotspot and Madagascar and southern Africa. The oldest island, Île de l&#x27;Est, formed roughly 9 million years ago from a hotspot, which has continued forming islands to the west until, ostensibly, the present. Despite this apparently young age, no volcanic activity has been observed to date on any of the islands.

==Geography==
Not including minor islets or rock reefs etc., the Crozet group consists of six islands. From west to east:

(1) Group of two major islands (Grande Île—Big Island, and Petite Île—Little Island) and about 20 pinnacle rocks.

The Eastern and Western Groups are apart (from Île des Pingouins to Île de la Possession).

The Crozet Islands are uninhabited except for the research station Alfred Faure (Port Alfred) on the east side of Île de la Possession, which has been continuously staffed since 1963. Previous scientific stations included La Grande Manchotière and La Petite Manchotière.

===Climate===
The Crozet Islands have a maritime-influenced tundra climate (Köppen climate classification, ET). Monthly temperatures average around and in winter and summer, respectively. Precipitation is high, with over per year. It rains on average 300 days a year, and winds exceeding occur on 100 days a year. The temperatures may rise to in summer and rarely go below , even in winter.

===Flora and fauna===
The islands are part of the Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra ecoregion that includes several subantarctic islands. In this cold climate, plant life is mainly limited to grasses, mosses and lichens, while the main animals are insects along with large populations of seabirds, seals and penguins.

The Crozet Islands are home to four species of penguins. Most abundant are the macaroni penguin, of which some 2 million pairs breed on the islands, and the king penguin, home to 700,000 breeding pairs; half the world&#x27;s population. The eastern rockhopper penguin also can be found, and there is a small colony of gentoo penguins. There is also an endemic subspecies of the duck Eaton&#x27;s pintail. Other birds include black-faced sheathbills, petrels, and albatross, including the wandering albatross.

Mammals living on the Crozet Islands include fur seals and southern elephant seals. Killer whales have been observed preying upon the seals. The transient killer whales of the Crozet Islands are famous for intentionally beaching (and later un-stranding) themselves while actively hunting the islands&#x27; breeding seal population. This is a very rare behaviour, most often seen in the Patagonia region of Argentina, and is thought to be a learned skill passed down through generations of individual orca families. These killer whales also seem to stay around the Crozet Islands year-round, feeding on mostly seals during the summer, and then feeding on penguins for the winter.

The Crozet Islands have been a nature reserve since 1938. Introduction of foreign species (mice, rats, and subsequently cats for pest control) has caused severe damage to the original ecosystem. The pigs that had been introduced on Île des Cochons and the goats brought to Île de la Possession—both as a food resource—have been exterminated.

Another on-going concern is overfishing of the Patagonian toothfish, as well as the albatross population, which is being monitored. The waters of the Crozet Islands are patrolled by the French government.

== In popular culture ==
A 2012 French film, &quot;Les Saveurs du Palais&quot;, begins and ends with scenes in the Crozet Islands. The film&#x27;s protagonist, a grandmotherly chef from the Périgord region of France who signed on as cook for the research station, had once been the personal chef to President François Mitterrand.

In the 1978 novel &quot;Desolation Island&quot;, the fifth book in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey–Maturin series, the fictional naval vessel HMS &quot;Leopard&quot; is severely damaged by a collision with an iceberg in the southwestern Indian Ocean. The crew attempts to make landfall for repairs on one of the Crozet Islands, but they miss the island and continue to drift towards the east, unable to reverse direction.

In Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, the Pequod sails near the ‘distant Crozetts’, ’a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen’ in Chapter 52, ‘The Albatross’. See also chapter 58, ’Brit’.

&quot;Biggles Cuts it Fine&quot; by Captain W. E. Johns is set mainly in the Crozet Islands, where a fictional Russian base is discovered on, what is called in the book, “Hog Island”.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-884&quot; was a Type IXD/42 U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II. Her construction was ordered on 2 April 1942 and her keel was laid down on 29 August 1943 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen.

She was launched on 17 May 1944, but was never commissioned, and was badly damaged on 30 March 1945 by United States bombs.

==Design==
German Type IX/D42 submarines were considerably larger than the original Type IXs. &quot;U-884&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-884&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 24 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 150 rounds, and a Flak M42 with 2575 rounds as well as two C/30 anti-aircraft guns with 8100 rounds. The boat had a complement of fifty-five.

<doc id="649743" wikidata="Q3427416" url="?curid=649743" title="Fundamental representation">
<text>In representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, a fundamental representation is an irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a semisimple Lie group
or Lie algebra whose highest weight is a fundamental weight. For example, the defining module of a classical Lie group is a fundamental representation. Any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of a semisimple Lie group or Lie algebra can be constructed from the fundamental representations by a procedure due to Élie Cartan. Thus in a certain sense, the fundamental representations are the elementary building blocks for arbitrary finite-dimensional representations.

== Examples ==
* In the case of the general linear group, all fundamental representations are exterior products of the defining module. 
* In the case of the special unitary group SU(&quot;n&quot;), the &quot;n&quot; − 1 fundamental representations are the wedge products formula_1 consisting of the alternating tensors, for &quot;k&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot; − 1.
* The spin representation of the twofold cover of an odd orthogonal group, the odd spin group, and the two half-spin representations of the twofold cover of an even orthogonal group, the even spinor group, are fundamental representations that cannot be realized in the space of tensors.
* The adjoint representation of the simple Lie group of type E8 is a fundamental representation.

== Explanation ==

The irreducible representations of a simply-connected compact Lie group are indexed by their highest weights. These weights are the lattice points in an orthant &quot;Q&quot;+ in the weight lattice of the Lie group consisting of the dominant integral weights. It can be proved
that there exists a set of &quot;fundamental weights&quot;, indexed by the vertices of the Dynkin diagram, such that any dominant integral weight is a non-negative integer linear combination of the fundamental weights. The corresponding irreducible representations are the fundamental representations of the Lie group. From the expansion of a dominant weight in terms of the fundamental weights one can take a corresponding tensor product of the fundamental representations and extract one copy of the irreducible representation corresponding to that dominant weight.

== Other uses ==

Outside of Lie theory, the term &quot;fundamental representation&quot; is sometimes loosely used to refer to a smallest-dimensional faithful representation, though this is also often called the &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;defining&quot; representation (a term referring more to the history, rather than having a well-defined mathematical meaning).

<text>Venera 6 (&#x27; meaning &quot;Venus 6&quot;), or2V (V-69) No.331, was a Soviet spacecraft, launched towards Venus to obtain atmospheric data. It had an on-orbit dry mass of .

The spacecraft was very similar to Venera 4 although it was of a stronger design. When the atmosphere of Venus was approached, a capsule with a mass of was jettisoned from the main spacecraft. This capsule contained scientific instruments.

During descent towards the surface of Venus, a parachute opened to slow the rate of descent. For 51 minutes on May 17, 1969, while the capsule was suspended from the parachute, data from the Venusian atmosphere were returned. It landed at .

The spacecraft also carried a medallion bearing the State Coat of Arms of the Soviet Union and a bas-relief of Lenin to the night side of Venus.

Given the results from Venera 4, the Venera 5 and Venera 6 landers contained new chemical analysis experiments tuned to provide more precise measurements of the atmosphere&#x27;s components. Knowing the atmosphere was extremely dense, the parachutes were also made smaller so the capsule would reach its full crush depth before running out of power (as Venera-4 had done).

== Instruments ==
=== Spaceship ===
* Instrument COP-18-3M for the study of cosmic particle streams;
* LA-2U device for determining the distribution of oxygen and hydrogen in the planet&#x27;s atmosphere.
=== Lander ===
* Pressure sensors MDDA-A type to measure atmospheric pressure in the range from 100 to 30,000 mm Hg Art. (0,13–40 atm);
* G-8 gas analyzers to determine the chemical composition of the atmosphere;
* VIP device for determining the density of the atmosphere at an altitude;
* FD-69 for illumination measurements in the atmosphere;
* EC-164D to determine the temperature at the height of the atmosphere.

== Mission ==
Venera 6 was launched into an Earth parking orbit on January 10, 1969, at 05:51:52 UT and then from a Tyazheliy Sputnik (69-002C) towards Venus. After a mid-course maneuver on March 16 the Venera 6 probe was released on May 17, 1969, from the planet. 

It entered the nightside atmosphere at 06:05 UT and deployed the parachute. The probe sent back readouts every 45 seconds for 51 minutes and ceased operation due to the temperature and pressure effects at roughly altitude. The photometer failed to operate, but the atmosphere was sampled at 2 bar and 10 bar pressures.

He is best known for his work with Matt Lucas on the BBC sketch comedy series &quot;Little Britain&quot; (2003–2006) and &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; (2010–2011). From 2012 to 2022, Walliams was a judge on the television talent show competition &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; on ITV.
He is also a writer of children&#x27;s books, having sold more than 37 million copies worldwide.

Walliams played the role of Greville White in the 2007 television drama film &quot;Capturing Mary.&quot; From 2013 to 2014, he wrote and starred in the BBC One sitcom &quot;Big School.&quot; In 2015, he starred as Tommy Beresford in the BBC drama series &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, and wrote and starred in the sketch comedy series &quot;Walliams &amp; Friend.&quot; Walliams has won the award for Best TV Judge for his work on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; at the 2015, 2018, 2019 and 2020 National Television Awards.

== Early life and education ==
Walliams was born at St Teresa&#x27;s Maternity Hospital in Wimbledon, in the London Borough of Merton, in 1971. He is the son of Peter Williams (1936–2007), a London Transport engineer, and Kathleen Williams (née Ellis), a laboratory technician who worked at Sutton Grammar School. Walliams grew up in Banstead, Surrey, specifically in the residential area of Nork, with his mother, father and sister Julie. He was educated at Collingwood Boys&#x27; School in Wallington, and Reigate Grammar School in Surrey, where he was a contemporary of writer Robert Shearman. From 1989 to 1992, he studied at the University of Bristol, where he resided at Manor Hall and graduated with Bachelor of Arts (Drama). During university holidays in 1990, Walliams performed with the National Youth Theatre, where he met future comedy partner and friend Matt Lucas. He changed his stage name to David Walliams when he joined college Equity, as there was already a member named David Williams.

==Television career==
Walliams performed in the Big Finish Productions &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio play &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;, written by Mark Gatiss in 1999. In 2005, Walliams, Simon Pegg, Lucy Davis and Lauren Laverne starred in the video for Charlotte Hatherley&#x27;s single &quot;Bastardo&quot;. Later in the year, Walliams presented a documentary on James Bond, entitled &quot;David Walliams: My Life with James Bond&quot;. In 2007, he returned to non-comedy television, garnering positive reviews for his portrayal of a suave and dangerous manipulator in Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s &quot;Capturing Mary&quot;.

He portrayed comedian Frankie Howerd in the BBC Four television film &quot;Rather You Than Me&quot;. In 2010, Walliams appeared with Paul Rudd and Steve Carell in the comedy &quot;Dinner for Schmucks&quot;. Walliams played the strange mole-like alien Gibbis in the sixth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in the episode &quot;The God Complex&quot;, broadcast on BBC One in 2011. In April 2012 Walliams appeared in an episode of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Perspectives&quot; programme entitled &quot;David Walliams: The Genius of Dahl&quot;. Also in 2012, he narrated &quot;Are You Having a Laugh? TV and Disability&quot; on BBC Two, and the ITV2 series &quot;Top Dog Model&quot;.

In 2013, Walliams appeared in two episodes of the comedy series &quot;Blandings&quot; as Rupert Baxter, an efficiency expert hired to serve as Lord Emsworth&#x27;s secretary. Also that year, and in 2014, Walliams starred as chemistry teacher Keith Church in the BBC One sitcom &quot;Big School&quot;, which he created and co-wrote. The series also starred Catherine Tate, Frances de la Tour and Philip Glenister. In March 2014 Walliams narrated a short video for the charity, Electrical Safety First, featuring the character Charley from the Charley Says educational films of the 1970s.

For Comic Relief 2015, Walliams appeared as Lou Todd and Stephen Hawking in the Andy Pipkin role along with Catherine Tate as a nun. In 2015, coinciding with the 125th anniversary of Agatha Christie&#x27;s birth, Walliams played the role of Tommy Beresford in &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, a six-part BBC series. In September 2015, Walliams began filming for his BBC sketch show &quot;Walliams &amp; Friend&quot;, which also starred Joanna Lumley and Morgana Robinson and premiered on Christmas Eve in 2015. The show returned for a full series in November 2016.

Walliams hosted the final comedy show &quot;Thrills and Spills&quot; in December 2016. The final was held in Louisville, Kentucky.

In October 2019, Walliams became the new National Television Awards (NTAs) host for 2020, taking over after Dermot O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s ten year presenting stint.

===Matt Lucas===
Walliams and Matt Lucas first met at the National Youth Theatre. At their first meeting, Lucas did an impression of Jimmy Savile and Walliams an impression of Frankie Howerd. They would not meet again for another year. In the late 1990s, playing minor roles in sketches such as &quot;The Club&quot;, Walliams and Lucas played grotesque caricatures of various rock musicians in the series &quot;Rock Profile&quot; and in the spoof documentary series &quot;Sir Bernard&#x27;s Stately Homes&quot;. They were also stars of the Paramount Comedy Channel show &quot;Mash and Peas&quot;, and it was in this guise that they appeared in the Fat Les video. Walliams and Lucas also had small roles in &quot;Plunkett and Maclaine&quot; as prisoners.

The duo appeared together in a music video for the Pet Shop Boys single &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;, in which the two are apparently auditioning their version of the song&#x27;s video for Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, who are tied up and appear to be hostages.

The pair are best known for &quot;Little Britain&quot;, which ran from 2003 to 2009 on the BBC in the UK and from 2008 onwards on HBO in the US. The programme first aired on BBC Three before moving to the more mainstream BBC One. Among the characters Walliams played were Emily Howard, a deluded &quot;transvestite&quot;; Ray McCooney, an insane Scottish hotel owner; and Sebastian Love, an &quot;aide de camp&quot; to the Prime Minister (portrayed by Anthony Head) on whom Love has a huge crush. A successful live stage show of the series, &quot;Little Britain Live&quot;, was produced in 2006. A number of seasonal and charity specials followed, up to 2009. A spin-off series produced in the United States by HBO, &quot;Little Britain USA&quot;, aired in 2008. The characters from &quot;Little Britain&quot; played by Walliams and Lucas appeared in a 2010 UK television advertising campaign for the Nationwide Building Society. In January 2005 Walliams and Lucas were named the most powerful people in TV comedy by &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

Their later series was &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;, a six-part series airing on BBC One. The first episode was the third most-watched programme of Christmas Day 2010, and the most watched comedy of the year. The duo have not worked or made any public appearances together since early 2011 (although they each make separate cameo appearances in Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;The Look of Love&quot;).

&quot;Little Britain&quot; returned to BBC Radio 4 on 31 October 2019, for a one-off special entitled &quot;Little Brexit&quot;.

===&quot;Got Talent&quot; franchise===
From 2012 to 2022, Walliams was a judge on the ITV1 talent show &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; with Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and Simon Cowell. In 2015, 2018 and 2019, he was recognised at the National Television Awards as Best Judge for his involvement in the series.

In 2022, it was announced that Walliams would be joining Seven Network&#x27;s &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; as a judge for the show&#x27;s tenth season alongside fellow &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; judge Alesha Dixon, and Australian actors Kate Ritchie and Shane Jacobson.

In November 2022, after controversy erupted regarding leaked disparaging comments made by Walliams to contestants, it was reported that Walliams had decided &quot;to bow out after a ten-year run&quot;, and that he wished to leave the show &quot;on a high after a wonderful time&quot;. He was replaced by &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; judge Bruno Tonioli.

==Writing career==
=== Children&#x27;s novels ===
In early 2008 Walliams signed a contract with HarperCollins to publish two children&#x27;s books. The debut novel, &quot;The Boy in the Dress&quot;, illustrated by Quentin Blake, was released worldwide on 1 November 2008. It explores several of the themes of &quot;Little Britain&quot; from Walliams&#x27; own life on an emotional level, such as the camp humour of cross-dressing and effeminacy. The story recounts a neglected 12-year-old boy called Dennis&#x27; search for a female role model, his friendship with the popular girl in school, and the ways in which relationships develop along gender lines. The story has a strong resonance with Anne Fine&#x27;s 1989 book &quot;Bill&#x27;s New Frock&quot;. This book was adapted into a film for Christmas 2014.

In November 2009 came &quot;Mr Stink&quot;, again illustrated by Quentin Blake, about a 12-year-old girl who meets a tramp and helps look after him. She keeps him hidden from her family. The book consists of 26 illustrated chapters full of jokes. It is aimed at teenagers and children over 9. It was the last of Walliams books to be illustrated by Quentin Blake. The book was awarded the Children&#x27;s Award in the inaugural People&#x27;s Book Prize in 2010, and was made into a 60-minute film, which premiered on BBC One on 23 December 2012.

On 28 October 2010 Walliams published his third book &quot;Billionaire Boy&quot;, illustrated by Tony Ross, telling the story of Joe Spud, the richest 12-year-old in the country. Joe&#x27;s father is a famous inventor, and his wealth means that Joe has everything he could ever want: his own bowling alley, cinema and a trained orangutan who serves as his butler, but there is just one thing he really needs: a friend. The book included a &#x27;billion pound note&#x27; that was used to enter a competition to win a day as a billionaire in London. This was the first of his books to be illustrated by Tony Ross.

Walliams&#x27; fourth book, &quot;Gangsta Granny&quot; was released in October 2011 and again illustrated by Tony Ross. It tells the story of Ben who is bored every time he is made to stay at his grandma&#x27;s house as all she wants to do is to play board games and eat cabbage soup. Ben learns that she was once an international jewel thief and all her life she has wanted to steal the crown jewels. Ben is determined that they do it together. It won a Red House Children&#x27;s Book Award and was adapted to be a 70-minute film for BBC One and shown on 26 December 2013.

In September 2012 Walliams released his fifth children&#x27;s book, &quot;Ratburger&quot;, telling the story of a young girl named Zoe whose life is a misery as she has an evil stepmother. It was made into a one-off drama for Sky One.

&quot;Ratburger&quot; was followed in September 2013 by Walliams&#x27; sixth book, &quot;Demon Dentist&quot;, relating the tale of a young boy named Alfie with no family except his dad whose world goes upside-down when a new dentist arrives in town. The book won the top prize in the Younger Readers category at the 2015 Red House Children&#x27;s Book Awards.

Walliams&#x27; seventh children&#x27;s book, &quot;Awful Auntie&quot;, was released on 25 September 2014. This was the story of a girl named Stella whose Auntie has moved into her house with her owl, Wagner. It is the first (and currently only) of Walliams&#x27; books to not include Raj the newsagent, due to the book being set in the 1930s before Raj was born.

In September 2015 he released &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s Great Escape&quot;. The story follows a boy called Jack trying to rescue his Grandpa who suffers from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease from a care home run by an evil matron. The book was adapted for BBC One, with the script written by Walliams and Kevin Cecil, and starring Tom Courtenay as Grandpa. This book, although set in the 1980s like &quot;Awful Auntie&quot; is, sees the return of Raj the newsagent. The same year that &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s Great Escape&quot; was published, Walliams backed children&#x27;s fairytales app GivingTales in aid of UNICEF, together with Roger Moore, Stephen Fry, Ewan McGregor, Joan Collins, Joanna Lumley, Michael Caine, Charlotte Rampling and Paul McKenna.

&quot;The Midnight Gang&quot; was published in November 2016. &quot;Bad Dad&quot; was published in November 2017. Walliams sold £16.57 million worth of books in 2017. &quot;The Ice Monster&quot; was published in November 2018. In 2020, the book Code Name Bananas, which was set in World War II-era Britain was published, and was being announced on Walliams&#x27; Instagram. Walliams&#x27; next children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Spaceboy&quot;, was published in September 2022. On 5 April 2023, the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Robodog&quot; was published. The story is about Robodog, the newest recruit at the police dog school, as he sets out to save his city from some evil criminals trying to destroy it.

=== Picture books ===
=== Short story collections ===
Illustrated in colour by Tony Ross, Walliams&#x27; three &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Children&quot; short story collections, centered around &#x27;five beastly boys and five gruesome girls&#x27;, were published in May 2016, May 2017 and May 2018, respectively.

&quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Teachers&quot; was published on 27 June.

In July 2020, tweets by author and activist Jack Monroe described Walliams&#x27; books as &quot;like Little Britain for kids&quot;, with &quot;horrific racism and classism and bodyshaming in a veneer of privileged deniability&quot;. HarperCollins issued a response, stating &quot;David Walliams&#x27;s books have a diverse readership which is reflected in their content&quot;. Also in July 2020, Williams&#x27; next book, &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Parents&quot; was published, and the book followed the same structure as all of the previous short story collection books.

In September 2021 it was announced that one of the stories in &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Children&quot; would be removed after podcaster Georgie Ma made a complaint, saying Walliams&#x27; book was &quot;normalising jokes on minorities from a young age.&quot; The story criticised by Ma earlier in the year is &quot;about a Chinese boy called Brian Wong&quot; who is &quot;never, ever wrong&quot;. Ma, who also called out the story for its &quot;casual racism&quot;, talked in May with representatives of HarperCollins, who agreed to remove the story in future editions of the book. The book was later republished in 2022, with a new story about Charlie the Chucker, who &quot;delights in pelting people with snowballs&quot;.

On 28 April 2022, Walliams&#x27; next book in the short story collections, this time titled &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Pets&quot; was published. However, this book was illustrated by Adam Stower, Walliams&#x27; new illustrator, whereas all the other books in the series were illustrated by Tony Ross. The next and latest book of the series, &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Monsters&quot; was published on 6 July 2023.

==Other work==
=== Theatre ===
On 26 August 2008 Walliams made his stage debut at the Gate Theatre in Dublin opposite Michael Gambon in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, in front of an audience that included Pinter himself. The production transferred to London later in the year.

In 2013, he played the part of Bottom in a production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the Noël Coward Theatre opposite Sheridan Smith as Titania.

In July 2014, Walliams appeared on stage with Monty Python during their live show &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot; held at the O2 Arena, London. He was the special guest in their &quot;Blackmail&quot; sketch.

===Screenwriting===
In addition to his writing credits for his sketch shows and adaptions of his novels, he was set to co-write an animated film titled &quot;Shadows&quot; with filmmaker Edgar Wright for DreamWorks Animation. It was never made however, due to the staff changes at DreamWorks animation which left the film in limbo.

In 2018, Walliams also starred in the British Airways Safety video, which was conducted in conjunction with Comic Relief for the airlines in house charity. Walliams most notable occasion in the video is the lifejacket instruction. Since then the video has been reworked with a mixture of the previous version; however, Walliams still appears in the new version.

=== Podcast ===
Walliams hosted a classical music podcast for children called David Walliams&#x27; Marvellous Musical Podcast. The show was produced by Classic FM and won a gold prize at the 2020 British Podcast Awards.

=== Charity work ===
==== Telethon hosting ====
Walliams co-hosted a segment of the Sport Relief telethon in 2012, co-hosting the 22:00–22:40 slot with Miranda Hart when the show moved over to BBC Two while the BBC News at Ten was aired.

Walliams also co-hosted the 2014 Sport Relief telethon. This time, he hosted the earlier slot between 19:00–22:00 with Gary Lineker and later Davina McCall.

==== Swimming the English Channel ====
On 4 July 2006 Walliams swam the English Channel for Sport Relief. It took him 10 hours and 34 minutes to swim the 22-mile (35 km) stretch of sea, equivalent to 700 lengths of an Olympic-size swimming pool. This was wrongly reported as one of the top 50 recorded times for an unaided Channel crossing; in reality Walliams placed 167th at the time of crossing in only the CSA listings, excluding the CSPF listings. He raised over £1 million in donations. Under the supervision of his trainer, he trained for nine months to prepare for the swim. The training had to coincide with Walliams and Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Little Britain Live&quot; tour, so he daily had to train for several hours before performing on stage in the evening.

Walliams first swam from Lee-on-the-Solent near Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight in around two hours and also completed an eight-hour swim off the coast of Croatia before embarking on the cross-Channel attempt. Walliams has insisted that prior to his challenge he had never seriously taken part in any sport. The Bluetones&#x27; lead singer Mark Morriss wrote a song, &quot;Fade In/Fade Out&quot;, in honour of Walliams&#x27; achievement; it can be found on their self-titled album, released on 9 October 2006.

==== Swimming the Strait of Gibraltar ====
On 7 March 2008 Walliams, along with James Cracknell, swam the Strait of Gibraltar from Spain to Morocco, again for Sport Relief. He successfully completed the swim in just over 4½ hours.

==== Cycling ====
In March 2010 Walliams and a group of celebrities cycled an end-to-end journey through the UK, raising over £1 million for Sport Relief. Walliams suffered a serious fall when tackling the Kirkstone Pass, a thousand-foot climb in the Lake District but was able to complete the ride.

==== &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot; ====
In March 2011 Walliams undertook &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot;, in which he took part in back-to-back recordings of various panel show formats over the course of 24 hours to raise money for Comic Relief. The recordings were streamed live on the BBC website. He took part in 19 episodes of &quot;classic&quot; TV panel shows.

==== Swimming the Thames ====

From 5 to 12 September 2011 Walliams swam the River Thames from Lechlade to Westminster Bridge () and raised more than £2 million for Sport Relief. Once he had got out of the river Walliams said &quot;I think a bath is the only water I will be seeing for a while.&quot; The swim resulted in him getting giardiasis and injuring an intervertebral disc. In late 2013, Walliams had emergency back surgery to alleviate issues caused by the swim.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Walliams&#x27; father, Peter, died of an aggressive form of liver cancer.

In 2009, Walliams dated eighteen-year-old model Lauren Budd. Budd claimed Walliams had approached her agent, Premier Model Management for a date with Budd.

In 2009, Walliams began dating Dutch model Lara Stone. On 20 January 2010, they got engaged after her parents had given their blessing to the relationship. On 16 May 2010, the couple were married at central London&#x27;s Claridge&#x27;s Hotel. On 6 May 2013, Stone gave birth to the couple&#x27;s child, Alfred.

Walliams and Stone lived in a house with a recording studio, formerly owned by Noel Gallagher, known as Supernova Heights in Belsize Park, North London. It was reported on 4 March 2015 that, following five years of marriage, the pair had decided to try a trial separation after &quot;drifting apart&quot;. On 9 September 2015, Walliams filed for divorce from Stone, citing &quot;unreasonable behaviour&quot;. The couple were granted a decree nisi the next day; the marriage was formally dissolved six weeks after the date of filing.

Walliams hinted at being pansexual in the book &quot;Inside Little Britain&quot;, but said he did not like to be labelled by that word. In an interview with &quot;Radio Times&quot; in 2013, he stated: &quot;I think it&#x27;s all about falling in love with the person and that is overlooked, really. I hate it when people &#x27;confess&#x27; or &#x27;reveal&#x27; their sexuality and also things can change for people over the years. So it is about the person but I also think it goes beyond that. You don&#x27;t just fall in love with someone&#x27;s body, do you? You fall in love with someone&#x27;s soul and heart and brain.&quot;

Walliams has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and he described his 2006 swim of the English Channel as &quot;some sort of redemption&quot;.

== Controversies ==
=== Exposing teenagers&#x27; genitals and simulating sex during &#x27;Hide the Sausage&#x27; ===
Walliams performed a &#x27;Hide the Sausage&#x27; sketch numerous times during the &quot;Little Britain Live&quot; tour in 2006 and subsequent worldwide tours including &quot;Little Britain in Australia&quot; in 2007 and at charity events. Walliams portrayed a fictional, gay, former children&#x27;s entertainer and sex offender named Des Kaye who invites volunteers from the audience or celebrity guests to play the game. Recordings of the sketch include footage where Walliams attempts to kiss participants, manhandles them, pulls their trousers and underwear down, and simulates anal sex. Volunteers are seen &quot;grappling to keep their genitals covered.&quot; The sketch was criticised by gay rights campaigners and attracted criticism and concern from members of the public.

==== Teenagers during &quot;Little Britain Down Under&quot; ====
Footage from a 2007 BBC documentary titled &quot;Little Britain Down Under&quot; shows Walliams inviting male teenagers, said to be aged sixteen to eighteen, to play &#x27;Hide the Sausage&#x27; on stage. Walliams asks the volunteers to confirm their ages and says &quot;Bingo&quot; when one claims they are sixteen years old before adding, &quot;You&#x27;re a big boy for 16 aren&#x27;t you - that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll tell the judge.&quot;

Walliams is seen pulling down the trousers and underwear of young men before he appears to kiss their buttocks and simulate anal sex. The volunteers attempt to keep their clothes on.

During the documentary, Walliams reads a letter he claims was written by a victim of sexual abuse who criticises the Des Kaye character. Elsewhere in the documentary, Walliams says, &quot;I love cruelty, it&#x27;s my favourite thing in the world.&quot;

==== Exposing Jeremy Edwards&#x27; genitals and Mark Ronson&#x27;s buttocks ====
In 2006, Walliams performed &#x27;Hide the Sausage&#x27; during the &quot;Little Britain Comic Relief Gala&quot; at the Hammersmith Apollo. Participants included comedian David Baddiel and English actor Jeremy Edwards whose genitals were exposed to more than 3,000 people in the live audience. Walliams also &#x27;dry humped&#x27; Edwards and lay on top of him. Walliams said on stage, &quot;That was not meant to happen. You were not supposed to see gonad. Arse crack, yes. Gonad, no.&#x27; An image of the incident, that includes Edwards&#x27; penis, is available to purchase on Getty Images.

Chortle reported that, &quot;tellingly, Edwardswho seemed genuinely embarrassed by the incidentdid not appear at the final curtain call.&quot;

On 2 November 2009, Walliams performed the sketch with Mark Ronson at London&#x27;s O2 Academy Brixton in front of 3,000 people at a charity event for Concert for CARE. Footage from the event shows Ronson trying to stop Walliams from pulling his trousers and underwear down. Ronson&#x27;s buttocks were exposed. After the event, Walliams was reported to have said, &quot;When I put my mind to it, I have the strength of ten men so there&#x27;s no stopping me. Mark is a cool, calm character. To put him in that position was out of his comfort zone.&quot; Walliams claimed that he offered to buy Ronson a new suit.

==== Criticism and violent reaction from theatre goers ====
Matt Lucas discussed the &#x27;Hide the Sausage&#x27; sketch in his 2017 autobiography titled &quot;Little Me&quot; and claimed that some audience members reacted with violence. Lucas wrote that &quot;during a game of &#x27;Hide the Sausage&#x27;, he would almost always wrestle the trousers off some poor lad&quot; adding that, &quot;You could never get away with that today. In fact he didn&#x27;t always get away with it then. Sometimes David would get a clout for his troubles and I&#x27;d see him in the wings afterwards, nursing a sore ear.&quot;
Critics of the sketch included human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell who said it, &quot;crosses a red line into the sexual humiliation of young men.&quot; Tatchell added:Walliams&#x27; portrayal of a predatory paedophile is not funny. It&#x27;s sickening and unacceptable. That sketch should not be repeated anywhere. It should be withdrawn from public viewing and filed in a film archive so that future historians have evidence of what passed for &#x27;comedy&#x27; only 13 years ago. Some viewers will have interpreted Walliams as playing the trope of gay men as predators and paedophiles. Even though Walliams supports the LGBT+ community, his depiction plays into the hands of those who wrongly equate homosexuality with the exploitation of young people.

=== Sexual comments about Harry Styles ===
In 2011 Ofcom and Channel 4 received complaints regarding comments made by Walliams on &quot;Chris Moyles&#x27; Quiz Night.&quot; In regards to Harry Styles, Walliams said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to suck his cock.&quot; Styles was 17 years old at the time. Then director of Mediawatch UK, Vivienne Pattison, criticised Channel 4&#x27;s decision to broadcast the remark adding that &quot;jokes like this set up a context of behaviour that somehow normalises and justifies it.&quot;

=== Kim Jong-un Halloween costume ===
In early November 2017, Walliams caused upset through his dressing as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for Halloween and posting it online. He had shared the photograph on his Twitter account, in costume, wearing a black suit, wig, and artificial prosthetics that appeared to alter his eyelids and hairline. There was an immediate backlash online, many Twitter users branding the outfit &quot;racist&quot; and accusing Walliams of &quot;yellow-face&quot;. Others made the point that it was insensitive for Walliams to dress as Kim Jong-un given the North Korean leader&#x27;s &#x27;appalling&#x27; human rights record. Walliams responded to the backlash lightly, constructing a fake text message from Kim Jong-un which he posted to Twitter, reading: &quot;Hi Dave, Loved the Halloween outfit mate! Wet meself laughing. Don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about. Kim x. PS Can&#x27;t wait to read &quot;Bad Dad&quot;.&quot;

=== Presidents Club Charitable Trust ===
In January 2018, Walliams attended a Presidents Club Charitable Trust charity auction as a host, as well as offering the opportunity to name a character in a future book as an auction prize. The 2018 event was his third time hosting, with Walliams additionally offering that he would be &quot;personally presenting the book to your family over afternoon tea&quot;. This event was later subject to significant controversy, after undercover reporters stated many of the hostesses were subject to groping and sexual harassment from the all-male attendees. Walliams said he attended the event in a &quot;strictly professional capacity&quot; as host, and &quot;left immediately&quot; after his set ended, stating that he was &quot;absolutely appalled&quot; by the reports. The controversy caused some bookshops to remove his books from sale, with the owner of Chicken and Frog noting &quot;even if he was unaware, when the highly inappropriate suggested names were mentioned for his auction lot, or the plastic surgery to &#x27;add spice to your wife&#x27;, he should have walked away. He did not&quot;.

=== Stereotypes and black face ===
In June 2020, Netflix, Britbox, NOW TV and BBC iPlayer dropped Walliams and Lucas&#x27; &quot;Little Britain&quot; and &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot;, over the use of blackface and stereotypes to portray black, disabled, working class, transgender, and gay people. In Little Britain, both Walliams and Lucas use make up to portray different races, with Walliams portraying a black health-spa guest called Desiree Devere. Variety Magazine attributed the widespread removal of the series on streaming platforms to heightened awareness in the wake of George Floyd&#x27;s murder and the resulting Black Lives Matter protests. After the removal, Walliams and Lucas released identical apologies on their Twitter: &quot;[We] have both spoken publicly in recent years of our regret that we played characters of other races. Once again we want to make it clear that it was wrong &amp; we are very sorry.&quot;

=== Britain&#x27;s Got Talent remarks ===
In November 2022, it emerged that Walliams had made sexually explicit and derogatory remarks towards some of the contestants on Britain&#x27;s Got Talent, during a recording at the London Palladium in January 2020. He was recorded as saying of one of them, &quot;She thinks you want to fuck her, but you don&#x27;t... I know, she&#x27;s just like: &#x27;Oh, fuck off!&#x27; I was saying, she thinks you want to fuck her, but you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s the last thing on your mind, but she&#x27;s like: &#x27;Yep, I bet you do!&#x27; &#x27;No I don&#x27;t!&#x27; I had a bit of a boner, but now it&#x27;s going, it&#x27;s now shrivelled up inside my body.&quot; In a statement later, he said: &quot;I would like to apologise to the people I made disrespectful comments about during breaks in filming for Britain&#x27;s Got Talent in 2020. These were private conversations and – like most conversations with friends – were never intended to be shared. Nevertheless, I am sorry.&quot;

<text>Soul Survivor is a Christian movement, based in Watford, Hertfordshire, part of the charismatic evangelical tradition. From 1993 until 2019, it ran Christian summer festivals aimed at young people, as well as other events throughout the year. It is also the name of a church, centred on weekly worship services at its warehouses in Watford.

==Festivals==
Soul Survivor was used as the branding of annual festivals, well known in British evangelical churches. The organisation was registered at Companies House in the UK, on 12 May 2000, and with the Charity Commission on 12 May 2011. At their height, the festivals attracted 30,000 people annually, and in the financial year ending December 2019 during which the final festival took place, the charity had an income of almost .

=== History ===

==== Beginnings ====
By 1993, the number of young people attending the annual New Wine charismatic evangelical Christian family conference every summer at the Royal Bath and West Showground in Somerset was sufficient for the organisers to launch a specific youth event. The first Soul Survivor conference took place in the summer of 1993, under the leadership of Mike Pilavachi, a youth worker at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Chorleywood. The worship leader Matt Redman was also involved in the festival&#x27;s founding. Like New Wine, the Soul Survivor conferences were initially overseen by St Andrew&#x27;s Church, before being established as independent entities.

==== Growth of the festivals ====
1,896 young people attended the first Soul Survivor festival and in 1995, it was split across two weeks, named Soul Survivor A and Soul Survivor B. By 2006, annual attendance across the two weeks was around 25,000. Soul Survivor C was launched the following year at the Royal Cheshire Showground. In 2008, Soul Survivor A moved to the Stafford County showground with B and C remaining at the Royal Bath and West Showground. A fourth week was launched in July 2014 at the Thainstone Centre in Inverurie, later moving to Lendrick Muir in Kinross. In 2017, Soul Survivor moved to the East of England Showground near Peterborough for the Soul Survivor B and Soul Survivor C festivals. The final Soul Survivor festival ended on 27 August 2019 at the East of England Showground, near Peterborough.

==== Additional events ====
The Momentum festival, aimed at students and young adults in their twenties and thirties, was established in 2004. A further event, Naturally Supernatural, for the whole family, was launched in 2017.

=== Locations ===
Between 1993 and 2019, festivals were held at various sites across the UK. Brands and venues included:

The festivals consisted of seminars, sporting events and art, music and drama workshops during the day, and a charismatic worship service followed by live bands in the evening.

=== Live albums ===
The worship events at the Soul Survivor festivals were often recorded, and each year a live album was released featuring the most popular new songs from the festivals. The albums contained original songs written by the worship teams, as well as traditional and contemporary songs from other artists and churches.

==Soul Survivor Church, Watford==

A church, based in two converted warehouses in Watford, Hertfordshire, shares the name Soul Survivor but is a legally separate organisation. Started by a team of eleven from St Andrew&#x27;s, Chorleywood, in its current form, the church was incorporated as a charitable incorporated organisation in June 2019. There are now around 1,000 people attending three services on a Sunday, as well as a number of events throughout the week. Soul Survivor Watford is an Anglican church and so is part of the Church of England but is very relaxed and informal. Sunday services happen at 9.15am, 11.30am and 6.30pm each Sunday, with the 11.30 service livestreamed on YouTube. The church meets in two warehouse in Watford, Hertfordshire. 

The church raised to rebuild part of their site in June 2018.

Soul Survivor Watford is a Bishops&#x27; Mission Order of the Diocese of St Albans, and part of the Church of England.

==Investigation into Mike Pilavachi==
In April 2023, it was announced that Mike Pilavachi had &quot;stepped back from all ministry,&quot; including his roles leading Soul Survivor, while an investigation was carried out into &quot;non-recent safeguarding concerns&quot;. The internal investigation was completed in September 2023, substantiating the allegations made against Pilavachi and concluding that &quot;he used his spiritual authority to control people and that his coercive and controlling behaviour led to inappropriate relationships&quot;.

==Other events==

=== UK ===

In 2000, the Soul Survivor team partnered with The Message Trust on Message 2000 and &quot;Festival: Manchester&quot;, gathering 10,000 young people in the city.

This was followed in 2004 with &quot;Soul In The City&quot;, in London, a mission in which 20,000 young people from around the world gathered in the capital to undertake practical projects and evangelistic events.

Soul Survivor also organised &quot;Soul In The City Durban&quot; which took place in Summer 2009 in Durban, South Africa.

=== International ===
Soul Survivor has also held festivals and other events in the following locations:
== Legacy ==
A seminar on vocation to Christian ministry was timetabled at the festival every year, often led by principals of Church of England training colleges. Former Bishop of Kensington Graham Tomlin suggested that the events had a positive impact on the number of young church leaders training, particularly looking towards deployment in the church planting movement.

The festivals were also influential in the growth of the charismatic worship movement in the UK. Worship leaders Matt Redman and Tim Hughes, whose songs were sung internationally, began their careers at the events.

<doc id="649750" wikidata="Q204317" url="?curid=649750" title="Echternach">
<text>Echternach (, ; or locally ) is a commune with town status in the canton of Echternach, in eastern Luxembourg. Echternach lies near the border with Germany, and is the oldest town in Luxembourg.

==History==
The town grew around the Abbey of Echternach, which was founded in 698 by St Willibrord, an English monk from Ripon, Northumbria (in present-day North Yorkshire, England), who became the first bishop of Utrecht and worked to Christianize the Frisians. As bishop, he was the Echternach monastery&#x27;s abbot until his death in 739. It is in his honour that the notable Dancing procession of Echternach takes place annually on Whit Tuesday.

The river Sauer that flows past the town now forms the border between Luxembourg and Germany; in the later Roman Empire and under the Merovingians by contrast, the Sauer did not form a border or march in this area. The Roman villa at Echternach (traces of which were rediscovered in 1975) was reputed to be the largest north of the Alps. Echternach was later part of the Electorate of Trier (present-day Germany) and was presented to Willibrord by Irmina (Irmine), daughter of Dagobert II, king of the Franks. Other parts of the Merovingians&#x27; Roman inheritance were presented to the Abbey by king of the Franks Pepin the Short.

Echternach continued to have royal patronage from the house of Charlemagne. Though the monks were displaced by the canons of the bishop of Trier between 859 and 971, and although Willibrord&#x27;s buildings burned down in 1017, the Romanesque basilica, with its symmetrical towers, to this day houses Willibrord&#x27;s tomb in its crypt. The abbey&#x27;s library and scriptorium had a European reputation. As it flourished, the town of Echternach grew around the abbey&#x27;s outer walls and was granted a city charter in 1236. The abbey was rebuilt in a handsome Baroque style in 1737. In 1794 the church was sacked and the abbey used as a porcelain factory. In 1797, in the wake of the French Revolution, the monks were dispersed and the abbey&#x27;s contents and its famous library were auctioned off. Some of the library&#x27;s early manuscripts, such as the famous Echternach Gospels, are now in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. In the 19th century, a porcelain factory was established in the abbey and the town declined, until the advent of the railroad brought renewed life and an influx of tourists.

During the concluding months of World War II in Europe, on 16 December 1944, Echternach served as the southernmost point on the battlefront for the attempt of the German Wehrmacht forces attacking the Allies to retake Antwerp, during the Battle of the Bulge. The town was badly damaged in World War II but was thoroughly restored.

==Culture==
There are two main churches in Echternach. The larger is the Abbey&#x27;s Basilica of St Willibrord, which survives from the original abbey and is a fair monument of Romano-Gothic architecture. The basilica is now surrounded by the eighteenth-century abbey (today a high school) and is located in the heart of the town&#x27;s historical centre. The other is the parish church of St Peter and Paul, under whose altar lie the remains of St Willibrord. The nearby Prehistory Museum traces mankind&#x27;s history over the past one million years.

<text>Matthew Richard Lucas (born 5 March 1974) is an English actor and comedian. He is best known for his work with David Walliams on the BBC sketch comedy series &quot;Little Britain&quot; (2003–2006) and &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; (2010–2011).

Lucas first came to prominence on the comedy panel show &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, in which he portrayed scorekeeper George Dawes from 1995 to 2009. From 2015 to 2017, he portrayed the role of Nardole in the BBC series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He has also appeared in films, including &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (2009), &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010), &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;, &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot; (both 2011), &quot;Small Apartments&quot; (2012), &quot;Paddington&quot; (2014), and &quot;Wonka&quot; (2023). Lucas presented the baking competition show &quot;The Great British Bake Off,&quot; alongside Noel Fielding from 2020 to 2023.

==Early life==
Matthew Richard Lucas was born on 5 March 1974 in the Paddington area of west London, the son of Diana (née Williams; born 1945) and chauffeuring business owner John Stanley Lucas (1944–1996). His family is Jewish; some of his mother&#x27;s family fled Nazi Germany just before the Second World War. He was raised in a Reform Jewish household although his parents came from Orthodox Jewish families. He has had alopecia since childhood, having lost all his hair after being struck by a car at the age of 6. When Lucas was 22, his father died of a heart attack.

Lucas was educated at Aylward Primary School and Haberdashers&#x27; Boys&#x27; School in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. He studied drama at the University of Bristol between 1992 and 1995, although he did not complete his degree. He also spent time with the National Youth Theatre, where he met his future collaborator David Walliams.

==Career==
===Early work===
Lucas&#x27;s association with Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer began in 1992. He appeared in &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot; in 1995, and went on to star with them in &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;. He quickly rose to fame as George Dawes, a giant baby (often dressed in an adult-sized romper suit) who would deliver a string of meaningless gags and insults before delivering the teams&#x27; scores, while sitting at and playing a drum kit. He also appeared on occasion as Marjorie Dawes, George&#x27;s mother, who also appears in &quot;Little Britain&quot;.

He again appeared with Reeves &amp; Mortimer in the BBC TV series &quot;Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; and &quot;Catterick&quot;, in a variety of roles. In 1999, Lucas paired with David Walliams, with whom he had already worked in &quot;Mash and Peas&quot; and &quot;Sir Bernard&#x27;s Stately Homes&quot;, to create &quot;Rock Profile&quot;, a comedy show spoofing famous musical personalities. It is notable for being one of their first comedic collaborations.

His music video appearances include the Damien Hirst-directed video for Blur&#x27;s &quot;Country House&quot;, &quot;Jesusland&quot; by Ben Folds in 2005, &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot; by Pet Shop Boys, and &quot;Vindaloo&quot; by Fat Les.

Lucas ventured into stage musicals in 2002, when he took a role in Boy George&#x27;s musical &quot;Taboo&quot; at The Venue in London. He played the performance artist Leigh Bowery.

===&quot;Little Britain&quot;===
&quot;Little Britain&quot; is Lucas&#x27; most commercially successful work. The show came about when trainee BBC radio producer Ashley Blaker, tasked with coming up with ideas for a television or radio series, bumped into Lucas in London. The two were old friends from Haberdashers&#x27; and Lucas took Blaker to the Groucho Club, where he told Blaker of his ideas for a sketch show. &quot;Little Britain&quot; was launched as a radio show on BBC Radio 4 and it later became a TV series.

Among the many characters he plays in the series, which he writes and acts in along with David Walliams, are apparently &quot;disabled&quot; Andy Pipkin, teenage Bristol chav Vicky Pollard, homophobic homosexual Daffyd Thomas, and insensitive slimming club organiser Marjorie Dawes.

In January 2005, Lucas and Walliams were named the most powerful people in TV comedy by &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

===Later career===
In 2005, he took his first role in a television drama, a supporting part as a Venetian duke in the BBC historical serial &quot;Casanova&quot;, written by Russell T Davies. Also in 2005, he did voice work in the ITV children&#x27;s program &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Disasters&quot; alongside Rik Mayall. Since 2006, Lucas has been the voice of the radio and television character Digit Al, devised as part of a public information campaign on digital switchover. On 26 November 2006 he appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. He made a cameo appearance in &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; as Tom, the cousin of Shaun&#x27;s friend Yvonne.

In 2007, he released &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be&quot;, originally by The Proclaimers, with Peter Kay as a charity single for Comic Relief. He performed the single as &quot;Little Britain&quot; character Andy Pipkin, along with Kay playing as Brian Potter. He also starred as Mr. Toad in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, a 2006 television adaptation of the Kenneth Grahame novel.

He has appeared in &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; and &quot;Neighbours&quot; (the latter alongside David Walliams as &quot;Little Britain&quot; characters Lou and Andy), as well as a cameo role, playing &#x27;Chris&#x27; or &#x27;Jammy&#x27; at the wedding fayre, in the BBC Three sitcom &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;. Lucas has co-written (with Walliams) and performed in a new series of &quot;Little Britain USA&quot; for HBO. Lucas was the first celebrity to appear in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Big Brother Celebrity Hijack&quot; on E4.

On 9 April 2009, the series &quot;Kröd Mändoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire&quot;, featuring Lucas as a regular performer, premièred on Comedy Central, the first major comedy series which Lucas had worked on since &quot;Little Britain&quot;. In 2010, Lucas played Tweedledee and Tweedledum in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

Starting in February 2010, Lucas began hosting his own radio show, &quot;And The Winner Is&quot;, in which he handed out a fictional series of awards based on nominations by his guests.

On 3 October 2010, Lucas played Thénardier in the 25th Anniversary Concerts of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, at the O2 Arena in London. A year later, from 23 June to 10 September 2011, he reprised the role at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, in the West End. He has since collaborated with Alfie Boe, who played Jean Valjean, to record a duet of &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot; on Boe&#x27;s debut album.

Also in 2011, Lucas lent his voice to the CGI film &quot;Gnomeo and Juliet&quot; and he played a small role as the roommate of Kristen Wiig in the comedy &quot;&quot;Bridesmaids&quot;&quot;.

On Christmas Day 2010, the BBC premiered Lucas and David Walliams&#x27; latest series, &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;. Unlike their previous work, &quot;Little Britain&quot;, this new show concentrated solely on the airline industry, with Walliams and Lucas each portraying several characters. In a BBC Three interview aired on February 9, 2011, it was revealed that the creators had considered including Carol Beer, the travel agent character from Little Britain. However, they chose not to include her to avoid the impression that Come Fly with Me was just a spinoff. Instead, they introduced an entirely fresh cast of characters.

On 28 March 2012, Lucas appeared as the &quot;Generation X&quot; guest on the Australian game show &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Your Generation&quot;. On 10 April 2012, Lucas&#x27;s own BBC One show &quot;The Matt Lucas Awards&quot; began. It was a send-up of an awards program, with a panel of comedians giving their nominations for awards for a series of prizes concerning trivial topics.

Lucas also starred in the dark comedy &quot;Small Apartments&quot; released in February 2013 alongside James Caan, Billy Crystal, Johnny Knoxville, and Juno Temple with other cameo performances by notable actors. On 21 February 2013, Lucas appeared on the NBC series &quot;Community&quot; as Toby, an English friend of Abed Nadir. In 2014, Lucas played Ray Thomas in &quot;The Life of Rock with Brian Pern&quot;.

Lucas launched a new comedy series called &quot;Pompidou&quot; for BBC Two. The show began airing on 1 March 2015.

In May 2016, Lucas reprised his role as &quot;Tweedledee/Tweedledum&quot; in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass,&quot; sequel to &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Lucas joined the BBC series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for its tenth series, reprising the character Nardole, which he had previously played in the 2015 and 2016 Christmas specials, &quot;The Husbands of River Song&quot; and &quot;The Return of Doctor Mysterio&quot; respectively.

On 16 February 2017, Lucas was awarded an Honorary Degree &quot;Doctor of Letters&quot; by the University of Bristol, where he had studied for two years in the 1990s but had left before completing his degree course. On 3 October 2017, Lucas released his autobiography titled &quot;Little Me&quot;, published by Canongate Books in hardback. The paperback edition was released on 7 June 2018.

From 2 July to 25 August 2018, Lucas played Bill Snibson in a revival of &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; at Chichester Festival Theatre.

In 2019, Lucas was the bank holiday cover host for the Radio 2 Breakfast Show. He also covered Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Sunday 5–7pm show during that summer. Fearne Cotton was the main breakfast show holiday cover host.
In 2021, Lucas continued to sit in for Zoe Ball and host the Radio 2 Breakfast Show.

From 10 August to 30 November 2019, Lucas appeared in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; at the Gielgud Theatre in London&#x27;s West End, playing the role of Monsieur Thénardier in a fully staged concert adaptation of the musical. On 20 December 2019, Lucas returned to the role at the Sondheim Theatre, after actor Gerard Carey contracted vocal damage through pneumonia and was forced to pull out. On 10 January 2020, Lucas himself was forced to withdraw from the show following a back injury.

In March 2020, he became the new co-host of the Channel 4 and Love Productions television show &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;, taking over from Sandi Toksvig. He departed from the programme in December 2022.

On 3 April 2020, Lucas released a reworked version of his &quot;Baked Potato Song&quot; from &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; titled &quot;Thank You Baked Potato&quot;, with all proceeds from the track going towards the Feed NHS campaign, which aims to provide meals for NHS workers in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. The song reached No. 34 in the charts. Lucas also wrote a children&#x27;s picture book based on &quot;Thank You, Baked Potato&quot;, published by Egmont and all proceeds again go to Feed NHS.

In 2020, Lucas, along with his &quot;Little Britain&quot; co-star David Walliams, apologised for their portrayal of characters using racial caricatures, &quot;including an obese Caribbean woman called Desiree DeVere, portrayed in blackface, and a &#x27;portly Thai bride&#x27; called Ting Tong.&quot; This was prompted after Netflix and BBC iPlayer removed the show from their catalogues.

==Personal life==
Lucas is a patron of the Karen Morris Memorial Trust, a UK charity for leukaemia patients and their families. In April 2003, he appeared on &quot;Celebrity Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and won £62,500 for the charity.

Lucas is gay. He first suspected his sexuality at age seven. At a ceremony in Central London in December 2006, he entered into a civil partnership with Kevin McGee. In attendance were Barbara Windsor, Neil Tennant, Elton John, and Courtney Love. They separated and had their civil partnership dissolved through the High Court in 2008.
Lucas was raised as Jewish but has variously described himself as an atheist and a &quot;fairly secular Jew&quot;. In 2022, he was the subject of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; and learned that many of his grandmother&#x27;s cousins had been murdered in the Holocaust. His grandmother&#x27;s cousin, Werner Goldschmidt, had lived with the family of diarist Anne Frank in Amsterdam in 1942. In 2021, 83 years after his grandmother left Berlin, Lucas obtained German citizenship.

Lucas is an avid supporter of Arsenal Football Club.

From 2012 to 2015, Lucas lived with his &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; co-star Rebel Wilson in West Hollywood.

<doc id="649760" wikidata="Q155098" url="?curid=649760" title="Leptospirosis">
<text>Leptospirosis is a blood infection caused by the bacterium &quot;Leptospira&quot; that can infect humans, dogs, rodents and many other wild and domesticated animals. Signs and symptoms can range from none to mild (headaches, muscle pains, and fevers) to severe (bleeding in the lungs or meningitis). Weil&#x27;s disease ( ), the acute, severe form of leptospirosis, causes the infected individual to become jaundiced (skin and eyes become yellow), develop kidney failure, and bleed. Bleeding from the lungs associated with leptospirosis is known as severe pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome.
More than ten genetic types of &quot;Leptospira&quot; cause disease in humans. Both wild and domestic animals can spread the disease, most commonly rodents. The bacteria are spread to humans through animal urine or feces, or water or soil contaminated with animal urine and feces, coming into contact with the eyes, mouth, nose or breaks in the skin. In developing countries, the disease occurs most commonly in pest control, farmers and low-income people who live in areas with poor sanitation. In developed countries, it occurs during heavy downpours and is a risk to pest controllers, sewage workers and those involved in outdoor activities in warm and wet areas. Diagnosis is typically by testing for antibodies against the bacteria or finding bacterial DNA in the blood.
Efforts to prevent the disease include protective equipment to block contact when working with potentially infected animals, washing after contact, and reducing rodents in areas where people live and work. The antibiotic doxycycline is effective in preventing leptospirosis infection. Human vaccines are of limited usefulness; vaccines for other animals are more widely available. Treatment when infected is with antibiotics such as doxycycline, penicillin, or ceftriaxone. The overall risk of death is 5–10%. However, when the lungs are involved, the risk of death increases to the range of 50–70%.
It is estimated that one million severe cases of leptospirosis in humans occur every year, causing about 58,900 deaths. The disease is most common in tropical areas of the world but may occur anywhere. Outbreaks may arise after heavy rainfall. The disease was first described by physician Adolf Weil in 1886 in Germany. Infected animals may have no, mild or severe symptoms. These may vary by the type of animal. In some animals &quot;Leptospira&quot; live in the reproductive tract, leading to transmission during mating.
==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of leptospirosis usually appear one to two weeks after infection, but the incubation period can be as long as a month. The illness is biphasic in a majority of symptomatic cases. Symptoms of the first phase (acute or leptospiremic phase) last five to seven days. In the second phase (immune phase), the symptoms resolve as antibodies against the bacteria are produced. Additional symptoms develop in the second phase. The phases of illness may not be distinct, especially in patients with severe illness. 90% of those infected experience mild symptoms while 10% experience severe leptospirosis.

Leptospiral infection in humans causes a range of symptoms, though some infected persons may have none. The disease begins suddenly with fever accompanied by chills, intense headache, severe muscle aches and abdominal pain. A headache brought on by leptospirosis causes throbbing pain and is characteristically located at the head&#x27;s bilateral temporal or frontal regions. The person could also have pain behind the eyes and a sensitivity to light. Muscle pain usually involves the calf muscle and the lower back. The most characteristic feature of leptospirosis is the conjunctival suffusion (conjunctivitis without exudate) which is rarely found in other febrile illnesses. Other characteristic findings on the eye include subconjunctival bleeding and jaundice. A rash is rarely found in leptospirosis. When one is found alternative diagnoses such as dengue fever and chikungunya fever should be considered. Dry cough is observed in 20–57% of people with leptospirosis. Thus, this clinical feature can mislead a doctor to diagnose the disease as a respiratory illness. Additionally, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea frequently occur. Vomiting and diarrhea may contribute to dehydration. The abdominal pain can be due to acalculous cholecystitis or inflammation of the pancreas. Rarely, the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen may be enlarged and palpable.

There will be a resolution of symptoms for one to three days. The immune phase starts after this and can last from four to 30 days and can be anything from brain to kidney complications. The hallmark of the second phase is inflammation of the membranes covering the brain. Signs and symptoms of meningitis include severe headache and neck stiffness. Kidney involvement is associated with reduced or absent urine output.

The classic form of severe leptospirosis, known as Weil&#x27;s disease, is characterised by liver damage (causing jaundice), kidney failure, and bleeding, which happens in 5–10% of those infected. Lung and brain damage can also occur. For those with signs of inflammation of membranes covering the brain and the brain itself, altered level of consciousness can happen. A variety of neurological problems such as paralysis of half of the body, complete inflammation of a whole horizontal section of spinal cord, and Guillain-Barré syndrome are the complications. Signs of bleeding such as petechiae, ecchymoses, nose bleeding, blackish stools due to bleeding in the stomach, vomiting blood and bleeding from the lungs can also be found. Prolongation of prothrombin time in coagulation testing is associated with severe bleeding manifestation. However, low platelet count is not associated with severe bleeding. Pulmonary haemorrhage is alveolar haemorrhage (bleeding into the alveoli of the lungs) leading to massive coughing up of blood, and causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, where the risk of death is more than 50%. Rarely, inflammation of the heart muscles, inflammation of membranes covering the heart, abnormalities in the heart&#x27;s natural pacemaker and abnormal heart rhythms may occur.

==Cause==
===Bacteria===

Leptospirosis is caused by spirochaete bacteria that belong to the genus &quot;Leptospira&quot;, which are aerobic, right-handed helical, and 6–20 micrometers long. Like Gram-negative bacteria, &quot;Leptospira&quot; have an outer membrane studded with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the surface, an inner membrane and a layer of peptidoglycan cell wall. However, unlike Gram-negative bacteria, the peptidoglycan layer in &quot;Leptospira&quot; lies closer to the inner than the outer membrane. This results in a fluid outer membrane loosely associated with the cell wall. In addition, &quot;Leptospira&quot; have a flagellum located in the periplasm, associated with corkscrew style movement. Chemoreceptors at the poles of the bacteria sense various substrates and change the direction of its movement. The bacteria are traditionally visualised using dark-field microscopy without staining.

A total of 66 species of &quot;Leptospira&quot; has been identified. Based on their genomic sequence, they are divided into two clades and four subclades: P1, P2, S1, and S2. The 19 members of the P1 subclade include the 8 species that can cause severe disease in humans: &quot;L. alexanderi&quot;, &quot;L. borgpetersenii&quot;, &quot;L. interrogans&quot;, &quot;L. kirschneri&quot;, &quot;L. mayottensis&quot;, &quot;L. noguchii&quot;, &quot;L. santarosai&quot;, and &quot;L. weilii.&quot; The P2 clade comprises 21 species that may cause mild disease in humans. The remaining 26 species comprise the S1 and S2 subclades, which include &quot;saprophytes&quot; known to consume decaying matter (saprotrophic nutrition). Pathogenic &quot;Leptospira&quot; do not multiply in the environment. &quot;Leptospira&quot; require high humidity for survival but can remain alive in environments such as stagnant water or contaminated soil. The bacterium can be killed by temperatures of and can be inactivated by 70% ethanol, 1% sodium hypochlorite, formaldehyde, detergents and acids.

&quot;Leptospira&quot; are also classified based on their serovar. The diverse sugar composition of the lipopolysaccharide on the surface of the bacteria is responsible for the antigenic difference between serovars. About 300 pathogenic serovars of &quot;Leptospira&quot; are recognised. Antigenically related serovars (belonging to the same serogroup) may belong to different species because of horizontal gene transfer of LPS biosynthetic genes between different species. Currently, the cross agglutination absorption test and DNA-DNA hybridisation are used to classify &quot;Leptospira&quot; species but are time-consuming. Therefore, total genomic sequencing could potentially replace these two methods as the new gold standard of classifying &quot;Leptospira&quot; species.

===Transmission===

The bacteria can be found in ponds, rivers, puddles, sewers, agricultural fields, and moist soil. Pathogenic &quot;Leptospira&quot; have been found in the form of aquatic biofilms, which may aid survival in the environment.

The number of cases of leptospirosis is directly related to the amount of rainfall, making the disease seasonal in temperate climates and year-round in tropical climates. The risk of contracting leptospirosis depends upon the risk of disease carriage in the community and the frequency of exposure. In rural areas, farming and animal husbandry are the major risk factors for contracting leptospirosis. Poor housing and inadequate sanitation also increase the risk of infection. In tropical and semi-tropical areas, the disease often becomes widespread after heavy rains or after flooding.

&quot;Leptospira&quot; are found mostly in mammals. However, reptiles and cold-blooded animals such as frogs, snakes, turtles, and toads have been shown to have the infection. Whether there are reservoirs of human infection is unknown. Rats, mice, and moles are important primary hosts, but other mammals including dogs, deer, rabbits, hedgehogs, cows, sheep, swine, raccoons, opossums, and skunks can also carry the disease. In Africa, a number of wildlife hosts have been identified as carriers, including the banded mongoose, Egyptian fox, Rusa deer, and shrews. There are various mechanisms whereby animals can infect each other. Dogs may lick the urine of an infected animal off the grass or soil, or drink from an infected puddle. House-bound domestic dogs have contracted leptospirosis, apparently from licking the urine of infected mice in the house. Leptospirosis can also be transmitted via the semen of infected animals. The duration of bacteria being consistently present in animal urine may persist for years.

Humans are the accidental host of &quot;Leptospira&quot;. Humans become infected through contact with water or moist soil that contains urine &amp; feces from infected animals. The bacteria enter through cuts, abrasions, ingestion of contaminated food, or contact with mucous membrane of the body (e.g. mouth, nose, and eyes). Occupations at risk of contracting leptospirosis include farmers, fishermen, garbage collectors, and sewage workers. The disease is also related to adventure tourism and recreational activities. It is common among water-sports enthusiasts in specific areas, including triathlons, water rafting, canoeing and swimming, as prolonged immersion in water promotes the entry of the bacteria. However, &quot;Leptospira&quot; are unlikely to penetrate intact skin. The disease is not known to spread between humans, and bacterial dissemination in recovery period is extremely rare in humans. Once humans are infected, bacterial shedding from the kidneys usually persists for up to 60 days.

Rarely, leptospirosis can be transmitted through an organ transplant. Infection through the placenta during pregnancy is also possible. It can cause miscarriage and infection in infants. Leptospirosis transmission through eating raw meat of wildlife animals have also been reported (e.g. psychiatric patients with allotriophagy).

==Pathogenesis==

When animals ingest the bacteria, they circulate in the bloodstream, then lodge themselves into the kidneys through the glomerular or peritubular capillaries. The bacteria then pass into the lumens of the renal tubules and colonise the brush border and proximal convoluted tubule. This causes the continuous shedding of bacteria in the urine without the animal experiencing significant ill effects. This relationship between the animal and the bacteria is known as a commensal relationship, and the animal is known as a reservoir host.

Humans are the accidental host of &quot;Leptospira&quot;. The pathogenesis of leptospirosis remains poorly understood despite research efforts. The bacteria enter the human body through a breach in the skin or the mucous membrane, then into the bloodstream. The bacteria later attach to the endothelial cells of the blood vessels and extracellular matrix (a complex network of proteins and carbohydrates present between cells). The bacteria use their flagella to move between cell layers. They bind to cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells, and kidney epithelial cells. They also bind to several human proteins such as complement proteins, thrombin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen using surface leptospiral immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins such as LigB and LipL32, whose genes are found in all pathogenic species.

Through the innate immune system, endothelial cells of the capillaries in the human body are activated by the presence of these bacteria. The endothelial cells produce cytokines and antimicrobial peptides against the bacteria. These products regulate the coagulation cascade and movements of white blood cells. Macrophages presented in humans are able to engulf &quot;Leptospira&quot;. However, &quot;Leptospira&quot; can reside and proliferate in the cytoplasmic matrix after being ingested by macrophages. Those with severe leptospirosis can experience a high level of cytokines such as interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 10. The high level of cytokines causes sepsis-like symptoms which is life-threatening instead of helping to fight against the infection. Those who have a high risk of sepsis during a leptospirosis infection are found to have the HLA-DQ6 genotype, possibly due to superantigen activation, which damages bodily organs.

&quot;Leptospira&quot; LPS only activates toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in monocytes in humans. The lipid A molecule of the bacteria is not recognised by human TLR4 receptors. Therefore, the lack of &quot;Leptospira&quot; recognition by TLR4 receptors probably contributes to the leptospirosis disease process in humans.

Although there are various mechanisms in the human body to fight against the bacteria, &quot;Leptospira&quot; is well adapted to such an inflammatory condition created by it. In the bloodstream, it can activate host plasminogen to become plasmin that breaks down extracellular matrix, degrades fibrin clots and complemental proteins (C3b and C5) to avoid opsonisation. It can also recruit complement regulators such as Factor&quot; &quot;H, C4b-binding protein, factor H-like binding protein, and vitronectin to prevent the activation of membrane attack complex on its surface. It also secretes proteases to degrade complement proteins such as C3. It can bind to thrombin, which decreases the fibrin formation. Reduced fibrin formation increases the risk of bleeding. &quot;Leptospira&quot; also secretes sphingomyelinase and haemolysin that target red blood cells.

&quot;Leptospira&quot; spreads rapidly to all organs through the bloodstream. They mainly affect the liver. They invade spaces between hepatocytes, causing apoptosis. The damaged hepatocytes and hepatocyte intercellular junctions cause bile leakage into the bloodstream, causing elevated levels of bilirubin, resulting in jaundice. Congested liver sinusoids and perisinusoidal spaces have been reported. Meanwhile, in the lungs, petechiae or frank bleeding can be found at the alveolar septum and spaces between alveoli. &quot;Leptospira&quot; secretes toxins that cause mild to severe kidney failure or interstitial nephritis. The kidney failure can recover completely or lead to atrophy and fibrosis. Rarely, inflammation of the heart muscles, coronary arteries, and aorta are found.

==Diagnosis==

===Laboratory tests===
For those who are infected, a complete blood count may show a high white cell count and a low platelet count. When a low haemoglobin count is present together with a low white cell count and thrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression should be considered. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein may also be elevated.

The kidneys are commonly involved in leptospirosis. Blood urea and creatinine levels will be elevated. Leptospirosis increases potassium excretion in urine, which leads to a low potassium level and a low sodium level in the blood. Urinalysis may reveal the presence of protein, white blood cells, and microscopic haematuria. Because the bacteria settle in the kidneys, urine cultures will be positive for leptospirosis starting after the second week of illness until 30 days of infection.

For those with liver involvement, transaminases and direct bilirubin are elevated in liver function tests. The Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup is associated with jaundice and elevated bilirubin levels. Hemolytic anemia contributes to jaundice. A feature of leptospirosis is acute haemolytic anaemia and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, especially in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Abnormal serum amylase and lipase levels (associated with pancreatitis) are found in those who are admitted to hospital due to leptospirosis. Impaired kidney function with creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min is associated with elevated pancreatic enzymes.

For those with severe headaches who show signs of meningitis, a lumbar puncture can be attempted. If infected, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination shows lymphocytic predominance with a cell count of about 500/mm3, protein between 50 and 100 mg/mL and normal glucose levels. These findings are consistent with aseptic meningitis.

====Serological tests====
Rapid detection of &quot;Leptospira&quot; can be done by quantifying the IgM antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Typically, &quot;L. biflexa&quot; antigen is used to detect the IgM antibodies. This test can quickly determine the diagnosis and help in early treatment. However, the test specificity depends upon the type of antigen used and the presence of antibodies from previous infections. The presence of other diseases such as Epstein–Barr virus infection, viral hepatitis, and cytomegalovirus infection can cause false-positive results. Other rapid screening tests have been developed such as dipsticks, latex, and slide agglutination tests.

The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the reference test for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. MAT is a test where serial dilutions of patient sera are mixed with different serovars of &quot;Leptospira&quot;. The mixture is then examined under a dark field microscope to look for agglutination. The highest dilution where 50% agglutination occurs is the result. MAT titres of 1:100 to 1:800 are diagnostic of leptospirosis. A fourfold or greater rise in titre of two sera taken at symptoms&#x27; onset and three to 10 days of disease onset confirms the diagnosis. During the acute phase of the disease, MAT is not specific in detecting a serotype of &quot;Leptospira&quot; because of cross-reactivity between the serovars. In the convalescent phase, MAT is more specific in detecting the serovar types. MAT requires a panel of live antigens and requires laborious work.

====Molecular tests====
Leptospiral DNA can be amplified by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from serum, urine, aqueous humour, CSF, and autopsy specimens. It detects the presence of bacteria faster than MAT during the first few days of infection without waiting for the appearance of antibodies. As PCR detects the presence of leptospiral DNA in the blood it is useful even when the bacteria is killed by antibiotics.

===Imaging===
In those who have lung involvement, a chest X-ray may demonstrate diffuse alveolar opacities.

===Diagnostic criteria===
In 1982, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed the Faine&#x27;s criteria for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. It consists of three parts: A (clinical findings), B (epidemiological factors), and C (lab findings and bacteriological data). Since the original Faine&#x27;s criteria only included culture and MAT in part C, which is difficult and complex to perform, the modified Faine&#x27;s criteria were proposed in 2004 to include ELISA and slide agglutination tests which are easier to perform. In 2012, modified Faine&#x27;s criteria (with amendment) was proposed to include shortness of breath and coughing up blood in the diagnosis. In 2013, India recommended modifying Faine&#x27;s criteria in the diagnosis of leptospirosis.

==Prevention==
Rates of leptospirosis can be reduced by improving housing, infrastructure, and sanitation standards. Rodent abatement efforts and flood mitigation projects can also help to prevent it. Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by people who have a high risk of occupational exposure can prevent leptospirosis infections in most cases.

There is no human vaccine suitable for worldwide use. Only a few countries such as Cuba, Japan, France, and China have approved inactivated vaccines with limited protective effects. Side effects such as nausea, and swelling have been reported after the vaccine was injected. Since the immunity induced by one &quot;Leptospira&quot;serovar is only protective against that specific one, vaccines have been developed. They do not confer long-lasting immunity to humans or animals. Vaccines for other animals are more widely available.

Doxycycline is given once a week as a prophylaxis and is effective in reducing the rate of leptospirosis infections amongst high-risk individuals in flood-prone areas. In one study, it reduced the number of leptospirosis cases in military personnel undergoing exercises in the jungles. In another study, it reduced the number of symptomatic cases after exposure to leptospirosis under heavy rainfall in endemic areas.

The prevention of leptospirosis from environmental sources like contaminated waterways, soil, sewers, and agricultural fields, is disinfection used by effective microorganisms, which is mixed with bokashi mudballs for the infected waterways &amp; sewers.

==Treatment==
Most leptospiral cases resolve spontaneously. Early initiation of antibiotics may prevent the progression to severe disease. Therefore, in resource-limited settings, antibiotics can be started once leptospirosis is suspected after history taking and examination.

For mild leptospirosis, antibiotic recommendations such as doxycycline, azithromycin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin were based solely on &quot;in vitro&quot; testing. In 2001, the WHO recommended oral doxycycline (2 mg/kg up to 100 mg every 12 hours) for five to seven days for those with mild leptospirosis. Tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin can also be used in such cases. However, in areas where both rickettsia and leptospirosis are endemic, azithromycin and doxycycline are the drugs of choice. Doxycycline is not used in cases where the patient suffers from liver damage as it has been linked to hepatotoxicity.

Based on a 1988 study, intravenous (IV) benzylpenicillin (also known as penicillin G) is recommended for the treatment of severe leptospirosis. Intravenous benzylpenicillin (30 mg/kg up to 1.2 g every six hours) is used for five to seven days. Amoxicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin may also be used for severe cases. Ceftriaxone (1 g IV every 24 hours for seven days) is also effective for severe leptospirosis. Cefotaxime (1 g IV every six hours for seven days) and doxycycline (200 mg initially followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours for seven days) are equally effective as benzylpenicillin (1.5 million units IV every six hours for seven days). Therefore, there is no evidence on differences in death reduction when benzylpenicillin is compared with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Another study conducted in 2007 also showed no difference in efficacy between doxycycline (200 mg initially followed by 100 mg orally every 12 hours for seven days) or azithromycin (2 g on day one followed by 1 g daily for two more days) for suspected leptospirosis. There was no difference in the resolution of fever and azithromycin is better tolerated than doxycycline.

Outpatients are given doxycycline or azithromycin. Doxycycline can shorten the duration of leptospirosis by two days, improve symptoms, and prevent the shedding of organisms in their urine. Azithromycin and amoxicillin are given to pregnant women and children. Rarely, a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction can develop in the first few hours after antibiotic administration. However, according to a meta-analysis done in 2012, the benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of leptospirosis was unclear although the use of antibiotics may reduce the duration of illness by two to four days. Another meta-analysis done in 2013 reached a similar conclusion.

For those with severe leptospirosis, including potassium wasting with high kidney output dysfunction, intravenous hydration, and potassium supplements can prevent dehydration and hypokalemia. When acute kidney failure occurs, early initiation of haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can help to improve survival. For those with respiratory failure, tracheal intubation with low tidal volume improves survival rates.

Corticosteroids have been proposed to suppress inflammation in leptospirosis because &quot;Leptospira&quot; infection can induce the release of chemical signals which promote inflammation of blood vessels in the lungs. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the use of corticosteroids is beneficial.

==Prognosis==
The overall risk of death for leptospirosis is 5–10%. For those with jaundice, the case fatality can increase up to 15%. For those infected who present with confusion and neurological signs, there is a high risk of death. Other factors that increase the risk of death include reduced urine output, age more than 36 years, and respiratory failure. With proper care, most of those infected will recover completely. Those with acute kidney failure may develop persistent mild kidney impairment after they recover. In those with severe lung involvement, the risk of death is 50–70%. Thirty percent of people with acute leptospirosis complained of long-lasting symptoms characterised by weakness, muscle pain, and headaches.

===Eye complications===
Eye problems can occur in 10% of those who recovered from leptospirosis in the range from two weeks to a few years post-infection. Most commonly, eye complications can occur at six months after the infection. This is due to the immune privilege of the eye which protects it from immunological damage during the initial phase of leptospiral infection. These complications can range from mild anterior uveitis to severe panuveitis (which involves all three vascular layers of the eye). The uveitis more commonly happens in young to middle-aged males and those working in agricultural farming. In up to 80% of those infected, &quot;Leptospira&quot; DNA can be found in the aqueous humour of the eye. Eye problems usually have a good prognosis following treatment or they are self-limiting. In anterior uveitis, only topical steroids and mydriatics (an agent that causes dilation of the pupil) are needed while in panuveitis, it requires periocular corticosteroids. Leptospiral uveitis is characterised by hypopyon, rapidly maturing cataract, free floating vitreous membranes, disc hyperemia and retinal vasculitis.

==Epidemiology==

It is estimated that one million severe cases of leptospirosis occur annually, with 58,900 deaths. Severe cases account for 5–15% of all leptospirosis cases. Leptospirosis is found in both urban and rural areas in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. The global health burden for leptospirosis can be measured by disability-adjusted life year (DALY). The score is 42 per 100,000 people per year, which is more than other diseases such as rabies and filariasis.

The disease is observed persistently in parts of Asia, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. Antarctica is the only place not affected by leptospirosis. In the United States, there were 100 to 150 leptospirosis cases annually. In 1994, leptospirosis ceased to be a notifiable disease in the United States except in 36 states/territories where it is prevalent such as Hawaii, Texas, California, and Puerto Rico. About 50% of the reported cases occurred in Puerto Rico. In January 2013, leptospirosis was reinstated as a nationally notifiable disease in the United States. Research on epidemiology of leptospirosis in high-risk groups and risk factors is limited in India.

The global rates of leptospirosis have been underestimated because most affected countries lack notification or notification is not mandatory. Distinguishing clinical signs of leptospirosis from other diseases and lack of laboratory diagnostic services are other problems. The socioeconomic status of many of the world&#x27;s population is closely tied to malnutrition; subsequent lack of micronutrients may lead to increased risk of infection and death due to leptospirosis infection. Micronutrients such as iron, calcium, and magnesium represent important areas for future research.

==History==
The disease was first described by Adolf Weil in 1886 when he reported an &quot;acute infectious disease with enlargement of spleen, jaundice, and nephritis.&quot; Before Weil&#x27;s description, the disease was known as &quot;rice field jaundice&quot; in ancient Chinese text, &quot;autumn fever&quot;, &quot;seven-day fever&quot;, and &quot;&quot;nanukayami&quot; fever&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsevier/Saunders&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan; in Europe and Australia, the disease was associated with certain occupations and given names such as &quot;cane-cutter&#x27;s disease&quot;, &quot;swine-herd&#x27;s disease&quot;, and &quot;Schlammfieber&quot; (mud fever). It has been known historically as &quot;black jaundice&quot;, or &quot;dairy farm fever&quot; in New Zealand. Leptospirosis was postulated as the cause of an epidemic among Native Americans along the coast of what is now New England during 1616–1619. The disease was most likely brought to the New World by Europeans.

&quot;Leptospira&quot; was first observed in 1907 in a post mortem kidney tissue slice by Arthur Stimson using silver deposition staining technique. He called the organism &quot;Spirocheta interrogans&quot; because the bacteria resembled a question mark. In 1908, a Japanese research group led by Ryukichi Inada and Yutaka Ito first identified this bacterium as the causative agent of leptospirosis and noted its presence in rats in 1916. Japanese coal mine workers frequently contracted leptospirosis. In Japan, the organism was named &quot;Spirocheta icterohaemorrhagiae&quot;. The Japanese group also experimented with the first leptospiral immunisation studies in guinea pigs. They demonstrated that by injecting the infected guinea pigs with sera from convalescent humans or goats, passive immunity could be provided to the guinea pigs. In 1917, the Japanese group discovered rats as the carriers of leptospirosis. Unaware of the Japanese group&#x27;s work, two German groups independently and almost simultaneously published their first demonstration of transmitting leptospiral infection in guinea pigs in October 1915. They named the organism &quot;Spirochaeta nodosa&quot; and &quot;Spirochaeta Icterogenes&quot; respectively.

Leptospirosis was subsequently recognised as a disease of all mammalian species. In 1933, Dutch workers reported the isolation of &quot;Leptospira canicola&quot; which specifically infects dogs. In 1940, the strain that specifically infects cattle was first reported in Russia. In 1942, soldiers at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were recorded to have an infectious disease which caused a rash over their shinbones. This disease was later known to be caused by leptospirosis. By the 1950s, the number of serovars that infected various mammals had expanded significantly. In the 1980s, leptospirosis was recognised as a veterinary disease of major economic importance.

In 1982, there were about 200 serovars of &quot;Leptospira&quot; available for classification. The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology&#x27;s subcommittee on taxonomy of &quot;Leptospira&quot; proposed classifying these serovars into two big groups: &quot;L. interrogans&quot; containing pathogenic serovars and &quot;L. biflexa&quot; containing saprophytic serovars. In 1979, the leptospiral family of &quot;Leptospiraceae&quot; was proposed. In the same year, &quot;Leptospira illini&quot; was reclassified as the new genus &quot;Leptonema&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Lepthangamushi syndrome&quot; was coined to describe a series of overlapping symptoms of leptospirosis with Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, and scrub typhus caused by &quot;Orientia tsutsugamushi&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Leptospira parva&quot; was classified as &quot;Turneriella&quot;. With DNA-DNA hybridisation technology, &quot;L. interrogans&quot; was divided into seven species. More &quot;Leptospira&quot; species have been discovered since then. The WHO established the Leptospirosis Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (LERG) to review the latest disease epidemiological data of leptospirosis, formulate a disease transmission model, and identify gaps in knowledge and research. The first meeting was convened in 2009. In 2011, LERG estimated that the global yearly rate of leptospirosis is five to 14 cases per 100,000 population.

==Other animals==
Infected animals can have no, mild, or severe symptoms; the presenting symptoms may vary by the type of animal. In some animals, the bacteria live in the reproductive tract, leading to transmission during mating.

Animals also present with similar clinical features when compared to humans. Clinical signs can appear in 5–15 days in dogs. The incubation period can be prolonged in cats. Leptospirosis can cause abortions after 2–12 weeks in cattle, and 1–4 weeks of infection in pigs. The illness tends to be milder in reservoir hosts. The most commonly affected organs are the kidneys, liver, and reproductive system, but other organs can be affected. In dogs, the acute clinical signs include fever, loss of appetite, shivering, muscle pain, weakness, and urinary symptoms. Vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain may also present. Petechiae and ecchymoses may be seen on mucous membranes. Bleeding from the lungs may also be seen in dogs. In chronic presentations, the affected dog may have no symptoms. In animals that have died of leptospirosis, their kidneys may be swollen with grey and white spots, mottling, or scarring. Their liver may be enlarged with areas of cell death. Petechiae and ecchymoses may be found in various organs. Inflammation of the blood vessels, inflammation of the heart, meningeal layers covering the brain and spinal cord, and uveitis are also possible. Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is the most common disease associated with &quot;Leptospira&quot; infection in horses in North America and may lead to blindness. ERU is an autoimmune disease involving antibodies against &quot;Leptospira&quot; proteins LruA and LruB cross-reacting with eye proteins. Live &quot;Leptospira&quot; can be recovered from the aqueous or vitreous fluid of many horses with &quot;Leptospira&quot;-associated ERU. Risk of death or disability in infected animals varies depending upon the species and age of the animals. In adult pigs and cattle, reproductive signs are the most common signs of leptospirosis. Up to 40% of cows may have a spontaneous abortion. Younger animals usually develop more severe disease. About 80% of dogs can survive with treatment, but the survival rate is reduced if the lungs are involved.

ELISA and microscopic agglutination tests are most commonly used to diagnose leptospirosis in animals. The bacteria can be detected in blood, urine, and milk or liver, kidney, or other tissue samples by using immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical or polymerase chain reaction techniques. Silver staining or immunogold silver staining is used to detect &quot;Leptospira&quot; in tissue sections. The organisms stain poorly with Gram stain. Dark-field microscopy can be used to detect &quot;Leptospira&quot; in body fluids, but it is neither sensitive nor specific in detecting the organism. A positive culture for leptospirosis is definitive, but the availability is limited, and culture results can take 13–26 weeks for a result, limiting its utility. Paired acute and convalescent samples are preferred for serological diagnosis of leptospirosis in animals. A positive serological sample from an aborted fetus is also diagnostic of leptospirosis.

Various antibiotics such as doxycycline, penicillins, dihydrostreptomycin, and streptomycin have been used to treat leptospirosis in animals. Fluid therapy, blood transfusion, and respiratory support may be required in severe disease. For horses with ERU, the primary treatment is with anti-inflammatory drugs.

Leptospirosis vaccines are available for animals such as pigs, dogs, cattle, sheep, and goats. Vaccines for cattle usually contain &quot;Leptospira&quot; serovar Hardjo and Pomona, for dogs, the vaccines usually contain serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola. Vaccines containing multiple serovars do not work for cattle as well as vaccines containing a single serovar, yet the multivalent vaccines continue to be sold. Isolation of infected animals and prophylactic antibiotics are also effective in preventing leptospirosis transmission between animals. Environmental control and sanitation also reduce transmission rates.

<text>Lochleven Castle is a ruined castle on an island in Loch Leven, in the Perth and Kinross local authority area of Scotland. Possibly built around 1300, the castle was the site of military action during the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296–1357). In the latter part of the 14th century, the castle was granted to William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, by his uncle. It remained in the Douglases&#x27; hands for the next 300 years. Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned there in 1567–68, and forced to abdicate as queen, before escaping with the help of her gaoler&#x27;s family. In 1588, the queen&#x27;s gaoler inherited the title of Earl of Morton, and moved away from the castle. In 1675, Sir William Bruce, an architect, bought the castle and used it as a focal point for his garden; it was never again used as a residence.

The remains of the castle are protected as a scheduled monument in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. Lochleven Castle is open to the public in summer, and access is available by ferry.

==History==

===Early history===
A castle may have been built on Castle Island as early as 1257, when King Alexander III of Scotland, then 16 years old, was forcibly brought there by his regents. During the First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328), the invading English army held the castle, then named Lochleven Castle; it lies at a strategically important position between the towns of Edinburgh, Stirling and Perth. Part of the present fortification, the curtain wall, may date from this time period and may have been built by the occupying English. The castle was captured by the Scots before the end of the 13th century, possibly by the forces of William Wallace.

English forces laid siege to Lochleven in 1301, but the garrison was relieved in the same year when the siege was broken by Sir John Comyn. King Robert the Bruce (reigned 1306–1329) is known to have visited the castle in 1313 and again in 1323. Following Bruce&#x27;s death, the English invaded again, and in 1335 laid siege to Lochleven Castle in support of the pretender Edward Balliol (d. 1364). According to the 14th-century chronicle of John of Fordun, the English attempted to flood the castle by building a dam across the outflow of the loch; the water level rose, but after a month the captain of the English force, Sir John de Stirling, left the area to attend the festival of Saint Margaret of Scotland, and the defenders, under Alan de Vipont, took advantage of his absence to come out of the castle under cover of night, and damage the dam, causing it to collapse and flood the English camp. However, this account has been doubted by later historians.

Loch Leven Castle was fortified in the 14th or early-15th century by the addition of a five-storey tower house or keep. According to Historic Scotland, it was built in the 14th century, making it one of the oldest tower houses in Scotland that still substantially survives. In 1390, King Robert II (reigned 1371–1390) granted the castle to Sir Henry Douglas, the husband of his niece Marjory. Beginning in the 14th century, the castle served as a state prison. Several notable men were imprisoned there, including Robert II in 1369 (before he became king), Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas (d. 1439), early in the 15th century, and Patrick Graham, the Archbishop of St Andrews, in 1478 (who died in captivity there).

===16th century===
Mary, Queen of Scots (reigned 1542–1567), stayed at Lochleven for a week in May 1562 to recover after she fell from her horse while riding out from Falkland Palace, In April 1563, she had an interview there with the Calvinist preacher John Knox.

In June 1565, Mary stayed at Perth, at Ruthven Castle, and Innerpeffray Castle. It was said the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Argyll plotted to capture her and Lord Darnley as they returned to Edinburgh riding by Loch Leven. Mary would have been imprisoned in Lochleven Castle and Darnley taken to Castle Campbell to prevent their marriage.

In September 1565, Mary visited Loch Leven again as the guest of Sir William Douglas of Lochleven (d. 1606). Two years later, Mary returned to Lochleven as a prisoner. She was held there from 17 June 1567 until her escape on 2 May 1568. She had been imprisoned there after the Battle of Carberry Hill on 15 June, when she surrendered to her noblemen, who opposed her marriage to the Earl of Bothwell. She was taken to Lochleven and given into the custody of Sir William Douglas of Lochleven. For most of her captivity she lived in Glassin Tower (built in the early 16th century), at the south-east corner of the castle. Some of William Douglas&#x27;s daughters slept in her bedchamber for extra security.

The household included Sir William&#x27;s mother Lady Margaret Douglas (mother of Mary&#x27;s half-brother the Earl of Moray), his brother George Douglas, and Willie Douglas (a young orphaned relative). Mary later wrote that her own servants at Lochleven included only two women, a cook, and a surgeon or doctor.

Mary fell ill on her arrival, which was suspected to be the result of a deliberate poisoning, and sometime before 24 July she miscarried twins that she had conceived with Bothwell; they were hastily buried in the grounds. She was probably nursed back to health by Agnes Leslie. Only a few days later she was forced to abdicate as Queen of Scots in favour of her infant son James. William Maitland of Lethington and Mary Fleming sent her a gold jewel depicting the lion and mouse of Aesop&#x27;s fable. This was a token alluding to the possibility of escape, and his continuing support for her, the mouse could free the lion by nibbling away the knots of the net. Mary wore the jewel at the castle and Marie Courcelles, one of her women and sometimes described as her French chamberer, provided a description. For a time, Mary was moved into the main tower, considered easier to guard at night than her first lodging.

Mary recovered during the autumn and winter, and gradually won George Douglas over to her own cause. A contemporary wrote that George was &quot;in fantasy of love wythe hir.&quot; Mary asked her servant Servais de Condé to send her materials for textile projects and embroidery. She also made multiple attempts to escape. Once, she pretended to be a laundress, while one of her ladies took her place inside the castle. However, as she was leaving, the boatman who was taking her across the loch recognized her, and took her back to the castle. Another time, she planned to escape by scaling the wall outside the castle, but one of her ladies-in-waiting, Jane Kennedy, injured herself while they were practising the escape. On the night she finally successfully escaped, she dressed as a servant, Willie Douglas stole the keys, and Marie Courcelles let her walk out of the castle. She was then rowed across the loch to where George Douglas was waiting for her, along with 200 horsemen, and they fled to Niddry Castle in Lothian. Three days after, her French cook Estienne Hauet and his wife Elles Boug packed her silk and velvet gowns and other items in a chest to send to Mary wherever she might be.

Old keys found when the level of the loch was lowered in the 19th-century are said to be those taken by Willie Douglas. The castle is one of many in Scotland said to be haunted by Mary&#x27;s spirit because she is waiting for her twins to return to her so they would know their loss of life was not her fault; the sadness she felt about their loss kept her trapped within the castle walls after her death. The English Earl of Northumberland was also held here, after offending Elizabeth I of England. He was confined at Loch Leven for two years before being sent back to England to be executed. In 1588, when Sir William Douglas of Lochleven succeeded to the earldom of Morton as the 6th earl, he inherited other properties along with the title, including Aberdour Castle in Fife, and as a result Loch Leven Castle became less frequently used.

===Sir William Bruce===

From around 1546, Margaret Erskine and her son William Douglas built a house on the shore of the Loch which was known as &quot;Newhouse&quot; The &quot;Newhouse&quot; replaced the island castle as the legal centre of the estate in 1619. On 12 May 1589, William Douglas, now 6th Earl of Morton, entertained the Danish Admiral Peder Munk at the Newhouse. He had been to Falkland Palace taking possession of the property as part of the king&#x27;s &quot;morning gift&quot; to his bride Anne of Denmark.

In 1675, the Loch Leven estate was bought from the Douglases by Sir William Bruce (c.1630–1710), royal architect in Scotland. Bruce built nearby Kinross House on the loch shore from 1686, aligning the principal axis of house and garden on the distant castle. The &quot;Newhouse&quot;, which was finally demolished in 1723, was just to the north of Bruce&#x27;s site. Kinross was one of the first buildings in the classical style erected in Scotland. Thereafter Lochleven Castle was no longer used as a dwelling, but it was preserved by Bruce as a picturesque focus for his gardens.

===Recent years===
Lochleven Castle had fallen into ruin by the 18th century, but the ruins were conserved and rubbish removed in 1840. The estate passed from the Bruces to the Graham family in the 18th century and then, in the 19th century, to the Montgomerys, who no longer occupy Kinross House.

Lochleven Castle was given in to state care in 1939, and is now managed by Historic Environment Scotland. Today, the castle can be reached by a 12-person ferry operated from Kinross during the summer months. The remains of the castle are protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

==Description==
The castle, and an outer enclosure of which little trace remains, originally took up almost the entire area of Castle Island. The present wooded, and considerably larger, island was formed in the early 19th century when the canalising of the outflow of the River Leven, which enters the Firth of Forth at the town of Leven, led to a substantial lowering of the water level.

The castle comprises a rectangular courtyard surrounded by a curtain wall, with a tower house, or keep, at one corner, and the round Glassin Tower projecting from the opposite corner. The foundations of demolished ranges of buildings remain around two sides of the courtyard. Of the outer court, only an earth bank shows the position of the walls, with fragmentary remains of a bakehouse the only visible structures.

===Tower house===
The tower house, or keep, at the west corner of the enclosure, measures by and originally had five storeys, although the roof and timber floors are now gone. The lowest level is a vaulted basement, with a vaulted kitchen above. The hall was on the next floor, with chambers above, all linked by a spiral stair.

===Glassin Tower===
The Glassin Tower is a round tower that was built into the south-east corner of the ancient curtain wall, probably around 1550. The derivation of &#x27;Glassin&#x27; is unknown. The purpose of the tower was to provide additional accommodation and to give the castle a more imposing appearance. Gunholes that allowed fire to be directed along the external face of the curtain wall improved defence. The tower has a vaulted basement for storing water, accessed separately from the courtyard. The basement has separate channels to allow water to be collected from the loch and waste water to be drained through a slop-drain. The lower chamber has an oriel window which would have given views over the loch. The upper chamber served as a bedchamber. At the very top a small room, accessible only from the wall walk, was possibly a study or library.

===Archaeological findings===
A minor excavation in 1995 found the footings and two steps of a stone stairway that provided access to the Great Hall of the tower. 16th-century pottery and animal bones were found in of debris near the forestair.

<text>The Dudley Boyz (also known as Team 3D) are an American professional wrestling tag team who consisted of kayfabe half-brothers Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley. The team was also joined by various Dudley family members, notably Spike Dudley and former valet Stacy Keibler. They are best known for their time in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) where Joel Gertner was their manager. They are also well known for their tenure in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, briefly known as Impact). They are considered one of the major teams that revived tag team wrestling during the Attitude Era and have been described as the greatest and most decorated tag team in professional wrestling history.

The team wrestled as the Dudley Boyz in ECW and WWF/E, and upon joining TNA—Due to WWE owning the rights to their names—they became known as Brother Ray and Brother Devon of Team 3D (named after their finishing move the Dudley Death Drop). Spike Dudley later signed with TNA and again sided with Team 3D as Brother Runt. Later in their TNA career, Brother Ray used the ring name Bully Ray while Brother Devon wrestled as simply Devon. After a brief feud with one another, Devon and Bully Ray were reunited as part of the villainous faction Aces &amp; Eights.

They are the only tag team to hold the WWF, WWE, ECW, WCW, NWA, TNA and IWGP Tag Team Championships, as well as to win the All Japan Pro Wrestling&#x27;s World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League (although they never won the AJPW World Tag Team Championship) and are thus regarded among the greatest tag teams of all time. During their time as members of Aces &amp; Eights, Ray was TNA World Heavyweight Champion on two occasions, while Devon was Television Champion. On June 15, 2014, at Slammiversary XII, Team 3D (as a team) were selected as that year&#x27;s induction into the TNA Hall of Fame. WWE recognizes them as the most decorated tag team in company history, with 18 world tag team championship reigns, while TNA recognizes them as 23-time world tag team champions. They were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018. In 2024, they will be inducted into the Hardcore Hall of Fame, making them the first to be inducted into the WWE, TNA, and Hardcore Halls of Fame

They are famously known for their pioneering use of tables in their matches, usually beginning with Bubba Ray asking D-Von to &quot;get the tables&quot; in the middle of a match. On May 21, 2007, Bubba Ray and D-Von opened the Team 3D Academy of Professional Wrestling and Sports Entertainment at the X-Cel Fitness Gym in Kissimmee, Florida. Longtime pro wrestling journalist Fin Martin of &quot;Power Slam&quot;, in contemplating the greatest tag team of all time, wrote: &quot;If one were to base his decision on longevity, title wins and success in a variety of companies, The Dudley Boyz would get the nod&quot;.

==History==
===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996–1999)===

The teaming of Mark LoMonaco and Devon Hughes was born from ECW&#x27;s Dudley family, a team of comedic fan favorites that consisted of many illegitimate children of the mythical traveling salesman &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Dudley. LoMonaco&#x27;s Buh Buh Ray Dudley at the time was a fat, stuttering hillbilly who entertained the fans by dancing and wrestled with several of his &quot;half-brothers&quot;, including Matt Hyson&#x27;s Little Spike Dudley, for the ECW World Tag Team Championship several times. Hughes, as D-Von Dudley (the only black member of the family), debuted in ECW in April 1996 at Massacre on Queens Boulevard. All the members of the Dudley family chased for the World Tag Team Championship at that time. Little Spike Dudley also debuted in 1996 and teamed with Buh Buh Ray against The Full Blooded Italians.

Initially, D-Von was hostile toward his family, saying that &quot;true Dudleys&quot; were not comedians. In February 1997, however, Buh Buh Ray and D-Von united at Crossing the Line Again and kicked all of the remaining Dudleys except for Big Dick Dudley and Sign Guy Dudley out of the family, becoming villains in the process. They became the most successful members of the Dudley family as they dominated the tag team division of ECW. They won their first World Tag Team Championship from The Eliminators (John Kronus and Perry Saturn) at Hostile City Showdown on March 15, 1997. This win resulted in a rivalry with the Eliminators, who won the title back at ECW&#x27;s first pay-per-view event Barely Legal. On June 20, the Dudleys won their second ECW Tag Team Championship from Kronus in a handicap match due to Saturn being injured.

The Dudley Boyz began their next rivalry with The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa), which began after the Dudleys defeated the Gangstas to retain the tag titles at Orgy of Violence on June 28. The Dudleys, however, lost the tag titles to the Gangstas in a steel cage weapons match at Heat Wave on July 19, 1997. In less than a month, the Dudleys defeated the Gangstas at Hardcore Heaven to win their third ECW Tag Team Championship. After Mustafa and Saturn parted ways with ECW, New Jack and Kronus teamed up to form The Gangstanators and beat the Dudleys for the tag title at As Good as It Gets on September 20. At November to Remember, the Dudleys participated in a four-way dance for the tag title, involving the champs The F.B.I. (Tracy Smothers and Little Guido), The Gangstanators and The Hardcore Chair Swingin&#x27; Freaks (Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten). The F.B.I. won the match and retained the titles.

The Dudleys began a rivalry with Rob Van Dam and Sabu in the summer of 1998. At Wrestlepalooza, they lost to Van Dam and Sabu. Eventually, the Dudleys turned on Spike, who then became involved in the rivalry. At Heat Wave, however, Buh Buh and D-Von, along with Big Dick Dudley, lost to Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman and Spike in a six-man tag Street Fight, ending the feud. On October 24, 1998, the Dudleys defeated Rob Van Dam and Sabu to win their fourth ECW Tag Team Championship. At November to Remember, however, they lost the titles to Masato Tanaka and Balls Mahoney in Louisiana. Dudley Boyz regained the titles from Tanaka and Mahoney on the November 13 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. They lost the titles to RVD and Sabu, a month later at the ECW/FMW Supershow II in Japan.

With the departure of The Sandman, the Dudley Boyz took advantage of Sabu&#x27;s ban from competing in the US, and D-Von defeated Rob Van Dam in singles competition for their sixth World Tag Team Championship. With a brewing feud between the Dudleys and the Impact Players, (Justin Credible and Lance Storm), Buh Buh Ray and D-Von still had their hands full with the new team of Spike Dudley and Balls Mahoney. It was at Heat Wave in 1999 that Spike and Mahoney beat the Dudleys for the gold. The Dudleys, however, powerbombed both men through flaming tables—the first time such a thing had been seen on PPV.

In late-1999, the Dudley Boyz signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). They made their final appearance with ECW at the Last Show at the Madhouse on August 26, 1999, winning their eighth ECW World Tag Team Championship from Spike and Mahoney in an impromptu match and threatening to take the titles to the WWF, only to lose the titles to Tommy Dreamer and the returning Raven in another impromptu match later that night.

=== World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (1999–2005) ===
==== Early years and tag team dominance (1999–2001) ====
In August 1999, Buh Buh Ray and D-Von joined the WWF. They requested a $1 raise above the WWF&#x27;s offer to stay in ECW, but their request was denied because ECW owner Paul Heyman was working a deal with Vince McMahon to supply talent to the WWF. Upon entering the WWF, Buh Buh Ray was first named “Bah Bah Ray Dudley,” then was renamed &quot;Bubba Ray Dudley,&quot; and returned to stuttering during his promos - a character trait he had initially used early in his ECW tenure. D-Von would then slap Bubba on the head to help him get his words out. After several weeks, most of the gimmick was dropped. They also dropped their classic tie-dye attire and began wearing camouflage-like ring attire.

While part of the WWF, the Dudley Boyz&#x27;s claim to fame was bringing the use of tables as weapons into the wrestling mainstream, often using their signature double-team move, the 3D, to put their opponents through one of these tables. They were initially villains and were known for Bubba Ray&#x27;s penchant for driving women (including Terri, Trish Stratus, Tori, B.B., Lita, Torrie Wilson, Jazz, Stacy Keibler, Molly Holly and Mae Young) through tables however they became fan favorites in mid-2000 when they engaged in a feud with T &amp; A. They then feuded with D-Generation X which culminated in a tag team table dumpster match at King of the Ring 2000 in which Bubba drove Tori through a table they spray-painted her name on. Throughout 2000 and 2001, the Dudley Boyz engaged in a three-way feud for the WWF Tag Team Championship with the Hardy Boyz and Edge and Christian. The feud incorporated two critically acclaimed Tables, Ladders and Chairs (TLC) matches, the first at SummerSlam in 2000. The second was at WrestleMania X-Seven in April 2001, in which Spike Dudley (who had joined the WWF in early-2001) interfered to aid the Dudleys.

In mid-2001, the Dudley Boyz became villains again in a storyline where they&#x27;d act more aggressive towards Spike Dudley, mainly due to his growing relationship with Molly Holly. They would also soon join The Alliance, a massive group of wrestlers mostly consisting of former ECW and WCW wrestlers led by Shane McMahon and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, who attempted to take over the WWF. During this time, the Dudleys acted as enforcers of the Alliance, interfering on the behalf of Alliance mid-carders and main eventers. Stacy Keibler became the Dudleys&#x27; manager during this time— dubbed the &quot;Duchess of Dudleyville&quot; by ECW manager Paul Heyman—but she later cost the Dudleys a tag team match, and they put her through a table. During the storyline, they became the first tag team to ever hold the WCW, ECW, and WWF Tag Team Championships. Later, The Dudleys beat the Hardy Boyz in a cage match at Survivor Series in 2001 to unify the WWF and WCW Tag Team Championships.

====Split, reunion and departure (2002–2005)====

As 2002 began, Spike feuded with his big brothers again, winning the WWF Tag Team Title from them with partner Tazz. Following WrestleMania X8 in March 2002, the WWF was renamed &quot;World Wrestling Entertainment&quot; (WWE) and the roster was divided into two brands, Raw and SmackDown!. The Dudley Boyz were separated for a short time when Bubba Ray was drafted to Raw and D-Von to SmackDown!. Bubba became a fan favorite again by reuniting with Spike Dudley while D-Von, who was still a villain, went on to become the corrupt preacher character &quot;Reverend D-Von&quot; and gained a protege with Deacon Batista. At Judgment Day in 2002, Bubba Ray was in the corner of &quot;Raw&#x27;s&quot; Trish Stratus, who was defending the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship against Keibler; D-Von and Batista were in Stacy&#x27;s corner as asked by Mr. McMahon. After Stratus retained her title, Bubba Ray and D-Von stood in the ring and shook hands before an altercation broke out between the three men where D-Von and Batista ended up driving Bubba through a table. As 2002 went along, Bubba Ray teamed with Spike on &quot;Raw&quot; to form a new version of the Dudley Boyz.

Bubba and D-Von reunited following the Survivor Series, when D-Von helped Bubba Ray, Spike and Jeff Hardy win their match against 3 Minute Warning and Rico. From then on, he was back on &quot;Raw&quot; (as he was part of a package deal that sent The Big Show to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;). After the Dudley Boyz were back together they immersed themselves in the &quot;Raw&quot; tag team division over the next sixteen months. During this time, alternating between siding with and feuding with Raw General Manager, Eric Bischoff.

They continued competing in the tag team division until all three Dudleys were drafted/traded over to SmackDown! in March 2004, Bubba Ray and D-Von aligned with Paul Heyman and feuded with The Undertaker. They were also billed from New York City instead of Dudleyville. In June of that year, they won the SmackDown! brand&#x27;s WWE Tag Team Championship, making them the first team to hold both sets of tag team titles in WWE history. By July, the Dudleys were helping Spike win matches by interfering in his favor, which Spike seemed to dislike at first, only to reveal his hand as the &quot;boss&quot; of the outfit after they helped him take the WWE Cruiserweight Championship from Rey Mysterio. This was a very ironically fitting role, as while Spike is considered the &quot;little brother&quot; due to easily being the smallest of the three, he&#x27;s actually the oldest in real life. Their final appearance of 2004 as members of the WWE roster was on the November 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; where they were taken out by the Big Show.

After a lengthy hiatus, Bubba, D-Von and Spike made their final appearance at a WWE sanctioned event as part of the original One Night Stand in June 2005. In July 2005, WWE opted not to continue contract renewal negotiations with the Dudley Boyz. In addition, there was a mass of wrestlers (including Spike) that were released by WWE for budgetary reasons. In August 2005, Bubba and D&#x27;Von were issued with legal notices instructing them not to use the (WWE trademarked) name &quot;Dudley&quot;. This led to a degree of acrimony between the former Dudleys and their erstwhile employers, as they had used the names since 1996, several years before all ECW intellectual property was acquired by WWE as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. Both believed Paul Heyman had granted them the rights to the name.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005–2014)===
====NWA/TNA World Tag Team Champions (2005–2008)====

On September 21, 2005, Bubba and D-Von (now under the names Brother Ray and Brother Devon, respectively) signed multi-year contracts with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), as Team 3D. Team 3D made their first appearance on the October 1 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, helping save the 3Live Kru (Ron Killings, Konnan, and B.G. James) from Planet Jarrett and Team Canada. Team 3D&#x27;s first rivalry in TNA was against America&#x27;s Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW), which included a mock funeral for the careers of Team 3D. At TNA&#x27;s December pay-per-view Turning Point in 2005, Team 3D defeated AMW in a Tables match. At Final Resolution on January 15, 2006, Team 3D fought AMW again, but this time for the NWA World Tag Team Championship, which AMW held. They won the match, however, due to Team Canada&#x27;s interference the referee awarded the match to AMW.

On the April 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Spike Dudley, now referred to as &quot;Brother Runt&quot;, debuted in TNA, helping Team 3D beat Team Canada. At TNA&#x27;s April pay-per-view Lockdown, Team 3D defeated Team Canada in a Six Sides of Steel Anthem match. Ray and Devon then started a rivalry with The James Gang (B.G. James and Kip James), with the two teams meeting at TNA&#x27;s June pay-per-view Slammiversary in a match which no one can be counted out or disqualified; Ray and Devon claimed victory in the match. After their brief absence, Ray and Devon made a return to TNA in October 2006 and went back on the tag title hunt. They first fought with The Naturals (Chase Stevens and Andy Douglas), who defeated Team 3D in their signature tables match.
At the beginning of 2007, Team 3D became the number one contenders to The Latin American Xchange&#x27;s (LAX) NWA World Tag Team Championship and faced them at TNA&#x27;s January pay-per-view Final Resolution. During the match, however, Runt was scripted to appear drunk, wearing a Santa Claus outfit, and interfere, causing Team 3D to get disqualified. They continued their rivalry with LAX at TNA&#x27;s March pay-per-view Destination X in a match which neither team could be disqualified called a Ghetto Brawl by TNA, in which they lost after interference from Alex Shelley. At Lockdown in 2007, Team 3D defeated LAX in an Electrified Six Sides of Steel match to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. In this match, the cage was electrified by electrical powerlines, to give the illusion when a wrestler touched the cage, they would be instantly electrocuted, in storyline.

On May 13, 2007, the executive director of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) stripped Team 3D of the NWA World Tag Team Championship due to the permanent discontinuation of the relationship between the NWA and TNA Wrestling. TNA continued to recognize Team 3D as their World Tag Team Champions and were then designated as the very first official TNA World Tag Team Champions, and the new TNA World Tag Team Championship belts were unveiled on their &quot;TNA Today&quot; webcast on May 16, 2007. On the broadcast they were awarded the new championship by authority figure Jim Cornette. Before the new championship was unveiled, Team 3D successfully defended their champion status at TNA&#x27;s May pay-per-view Sacrifice in a standard tag team match involving three teams known as a 3-Way Dance, which also including the teams of Tomko (Travis Tomko) and Scott Steiner (Scott Rechsteiner) and LAX. After the match, Steiner&#x27;s brother, Rick Steiner (Robert Rechsteiner), came out and attacked Team 3D which set up a match between the two teams at Slammiversary for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Scott, however, could not compete due to a legitimate injury; instead Road Warrior Animal took his place, but Team 3D retained the championship. On the June 21 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Cornette scheduled a &quot;Champions versus Champions&quot; match for TNA&#x27;s July pay-per-view Victory Road, in which the Tag Team Champions faced the World Champion and the X Division Champion. At Victory Road, Team 3D lost the championship to Samoa Joe after interference from the Steiner Brothers. On the following &quot;Impact!&quot;, they blamed the Steiner Brothers &quot;and&quot; the fans (who had actually been taking intervals to chant &quot;3D sucks&quot; for weeks at the time) for their loss. At Hard Justice and Bound for Glory, Team 3D lost to the Steiner Brothers, the latter defeat coming in a two out of three tables match after Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley, The Motor City Machine Guns, interfered on the Steiners&#x27; behalf.

On the October 18 &quot;Impact!&quot;, Team 3D assaulted the Machine Guns in the middle of their match, whipping them with studded belts and simultaneously powerbombing them through two tables while Ray derided the supposedly terrible quality of the Guns&#x27; match. Team 3D continued on this path of attack and verbal putdown, directing it towards the Guns&#x27; fellow TNA X Division wrestlers. This led to a match against the Guns at Genesis, which Shelley and Sabin won. They later stole Jay Lethal&#x27;s belt and kidnapped X-Division wrestler Johnny Devine, who subsequently turned on his fellow X Division wrestlers. While still referred to by most as Johnny, Ray and Devon called Devine &quot;Brother Devine&quot; and treated him as a member of Team 3D, though he did not share the half brother backstory. At Against All Odds, Team 3D and Johnny Devine fought The Motor City Machine Guns and Jay Lethal in a Street Fight but lost. Per the match stipulation, Ray and Devon could not compete unless they weighed in at 275  lbs. or lower.

After Against All Odds, Team 3D were matched with Shark Boy and Curry Man on numerous occasions in tag matches, with either one or both of the brothers being unable to compete due to the weight restriction. The week before Destination X, a stipulation was added to the match between 3D and Shark Boy and Curry Man: if Ray and Devon did not each weigh in at under 275 pounds, they would be fired from TNA. Both Ray and Devon made weight, and as such never had to weigh in under 275 ever again. Shortly afterward, Devine returned to competing for the X-Division Title, his association with Team 3D being quietly phased out for a time, though it would soon return. As this went on, 3D, meanwhile, became part of several loose collectives of self-identified &quot;bad guys&quot; and &quot;scumbags&quot;, aligning them at some point or another with almost every important villain on the TNA roster, including but not limited to Booker T and Kurt Angle. They began a feud with Christian Cage, Rhino and A.J. Styles, attacking them on several occasions. Their feud ended at Hard Justice with Cage and Rhino defeating them in a &quot;New Jersey Street Fight&quot;. They then began a feud with the team of &quot;The Monster&quot; Abyss and Matt Morgan, both teams competed at No Surrender with Abyss and Morgan picking up the victory.

====IWGP Tag Team Champions (2008–2009)====
Team 3D turned fan favorite when they joined the TNA Frontline after appearing to join Kurt Angle&#x27;s Main Event Mafia, double crossing them and jumping them along with Frontline leaders Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles and Rhino. They also attempted to put Angle through a table. At Final Resolution in December, Team 3D along with Styles and Joe lost to the Main Event Mafia in an eight-man tag team match. After Against All Odds 2009 Team 3D began a feud with Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) over the TNA World Tag Team Championship. They faced each other in an Off the wagon challenge match (where if 3D lost then the person who lost is kayfabe fired). Beer Money lost by countout. On April 19, 2009, at Lockdown, IWGP Tag Team Champions Team 3D defeated Beer Money, Inc. to win the TNA World Tag Team Championships in a match where both titles were on the line. This made Team 3D World Tag Team Champions for the 22nd time. On June 21, 2009, at Slammiversary, Beer Money, Inc. defeated Team 3D to become three-time TNA World Tag Team Champions after outside interference from The British Invasion of Brutus Magnus, Doug Williams and Rob Terry. Soon after, 3D then reignited their feud with the Main Event Mafia from late 2008 by becoming number 1 contenders to face Booker T and Scott Steiner for the TNA Tag Team Championships. After a failed attempt at the titles, they started a long feud with The British Invasion and other members of World Elite. Team 3D was attacked by World Elite on multiple occasions, until Beer Money Inc. intervened, leading to a loose partnership between the two teams.

====Various feuds and dissolution (2009–2010)====
On October 18, 2009, at Bound for Glory, Team 3D captured their 23rd tag team championship when they defeated Beer Money, the British Invasion, and The Main Event Mafia&#x27;s Scott Steiner and Booker T in a Full Metal Mayhem Tag Team match. With both the IWGP and TNA Tag tiles on the line, they captured the IWGP titles, which the British Invasion had beaten them for, only for the Brits to take them out and win what at the time were Booker and Steiner&#x27;s TNA tag championships moments later. During the following weeks Team 3D once again turned heel and aligned themselves with Rhino in a battle against the younger talent of the company. On the November 19 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Team 3D Academy of Professional Wrestling and Sports Entertainment graduate Jesse Neal joined Team 3D and Rhino and two weeks later Suicide joined Morgan, Hernandez and Dinero to level the playing field. At Final Resolution Morgan, Hernandez, Dinero and Suicide defeated Team 3D, Rhino and Neal in an eight-man elimination tag team match.

When Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff took over TNA at the beginning of 2010, Team 3D&#x27;s angle with Rhino and Neal was discontinued and they reverted to being faces, while starting a feud with The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags), who were a part of the new wave of wrestlers brought in by Hogan and Bischoff. At Against All Odds The Nasty Boys defeated Team 3D in a tag team match, when Jimmy Hart made his return to the company and interfered in the match on the Nasty Boys&#x27; behalf. Team 3D avenged their loss on the February 25 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, when Jesse Neal helped them defeat the Nasty Boys in a tables match. On the March 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Team 3D and Neal were scheduled to face the Nasty Boys and Hart in a six-man tag team match, but before the match the Nasty Boys attacked Neal backstage and put him through a table. Team 3D found Neal a replacement in the returning Brother Runt, but were still defeated in the match by the Nastys and Hart. However, after the match Neal made the save for Team 3D and helped them put Sags through a table. On May 16 at Sacrifice Ray turned heel by attacking Jesse Neal and costing him and Shannon Moore their match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, after feeling he had been disrespected by Neal. The following month at Slammiversary VIII Neal defeated Ray in a singles match after a distraction from the debuting Tommy Dreamer. The following month at Victory Road Ray and Devon faced Jesse Neal in a three-way match. During the match the members of Team 3D attacked each other, before Neal accidentally speared Devon and was then pinned by Ray.

On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Devon joined fellow ECW alumni Mick Foley, Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Stevie Richards, Rhino, Pat Kenney and Al Snow and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam in attacking Brother Ray, Abyss and the rest of the TNA locker room. The following week, Ray declined Devon&#x27;s offer to join the ECW alumni, before TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay–per–view event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to the company. However, on the July 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Ray turned face and decided to join the ECW alumni and seemingly buried the hatchet with his brother. On August 8 at Hardcore Justice Team 3D, accompanied by Joel Gertner, defeated Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney, billed as Kahoneys, in a South Philadelphia Street Fight. After the match Ray and Devon were assaulted by the Gangstas. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the ECW alumni, known collectively as EV 2.0, were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair&#x27;s stable, who thought they didn&#x27;t deserve to be in TNA. This marked Team 3D&#x27;s final appearance on their old TNA contracts, which expired shortly thereafter. The two then entered negotiations over new contracts. Team 3D returned to TNA television two months later on the October 7 live edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, promising a major announcement at Bound for Glory. At the pay-per-view Team 3D announced their retirement, but asked for one final match against the TNA World Tag Team Champions, the Motor City Machine Guns. Their new multi–year contracts with TNA were confirmed shortly thereafter. At Turning Point the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Team 3D to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship.

During Team 3D&#x27;s retirement ceremony on the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Ray turned heel by attacking Devon, reigniting the feud between the two. The following week Ray claimed that Devon had gotten weak, since Sabin had managed to kick out of a 3D at Turning Point, calling him the Marty Jannetty and himself the Shawn Michaels of the team.

Following this the two entered into a feud that spanned several events and shows, after which both men established their characters in singles storylines. Ray renamed himself Bully Ray, and as a member of Immortal even challenged for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and came second in the Bound for Glory Series, whereas Devon later entered a feud with D&#x27;Angelo Dinero regarding the allegiance of Devon&#x27;s twin sons and later went on to win the TNA Television Championship.

====Aces &amp; Eights (2012–2013)====
During the late summer of 2012, both Devon&#x27;s and Ray&#x27;s contracts with TNA were set to expire. While Ray agreed to a new two-year extension with the promotion, Devon parted ways with TNA. However, Devon returned on October 14, 2012, at Bound for Glory, being revealed as a member (later identified as the Sergent at Arms) of the heel faction Aces &amp; Eights after their victory against Sting and a now face Bully Ray.

Ray spent the next few months becoming close to Hulk and Brooke Hogan while feuding with Devon and the Aces &amp; Eights. During this time, Devon won back the Television Championship from then-reigning champion Samoa Joe, while Bully eventually was granted a match at Lockdown for Jeff Hardy&#x27;s TNA World Heavyweight Championship. At Lockdown on March 10, 2013, Bully Ray turned heel by defeating Hardy for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship using a hammer provided by Devon, then revealed that he was the President of the Aces &amp; Eights and had manipulated the Hogans all along. They then reunited as a tag team on numerous occasions during that time, including a tag team themed edition of TNA&#x27;s One Night Only PPV series, as well as house shows, and TV tapings. The team was forced to disband again on August 22, 2013, when Devon was pinned by AJ Styles (who was filling in for Kurt Angle due to legit DUI charges and rehab from alcohol and drug use) in a 5-on-5 match between Aces &amp; Eights and the reformed Main Event Mafia, in which the loser of the fall would leave TNA. Hours later, Devon&#x27;s departure from TNA was confirmed as legitimate.

====TNA Hall of Fame (2014)====
On June 15, 2014, at TNA Slammiversary XII, Devon returned to TNA and reunited with Team 3D two days later when he helped Bully Ray and Tommy Dreamer in their attack against TNA President Dixie Carter&#x27;s entourage; Devon and Bully Ray giving Dixie&#x27;s nephew Ethan Carter III a 3D through a table. On the June 27th tapings of &quot;Impact&quot;, which aired August 7, Team 3D succeeded in putting Dixie Carter through a table.

Team 3D were inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame on October 11, 2014, in Japan. They were the first tag team to be entered into the Hall of Fame, and were the third and fourth entrants. The following day at Bound for Glory, they defeated Tommy Dreamer and Abyss. The event was the final contracted date for each member of Team 3D. In July 2015, Bubba Ray made a one-off appearance for TNA as an authority figure.

===Japan and independent circuit (2005–2015)===

Aside from TNA, Team 3D has also participated in many All Japan Pro Wrestling and Hustle&#x27;s shows after their WWE release. Team 3D held an unbeaten streak in All Japan, where they won All Japan&#x27;s World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League in 2005. Team 3D has also won HUSTLE&#x27;s tag title in 2006, which they held until the promotion folded in October 2009. Team 3D also appeared in the Pro Wrestling Alliance June show, defeating Booker T and Dawg in the main event. Team 3D has also participated in two of the January 4 Dome Show PPV events for New Japan Pro-Wrestling. In 2008, they won a hardcore match against Togi Makabe and Toru Yano. They also performed in Puerto Rico&#x27;s World Wrestling Council, where Armando Estrada served as their manager. Team 3D wrestled Thunder and Lightning for the WWC World Tag Team Championship at Lockout 2008, but lost the match by disqualification. The following year, Team 3D were booked to face Makabe and Yano, at that time the IWGP Tag Team Champions, and the team of Satoshi Kojima and Hiroyoshi Tenzan in a three-way match for the Tag Team title, later with a hardcore rules stipulation added. However, days before the event, the team of Kojima and Tenzan withdrew due to Tenzan sustaining a serious eye injury which required an operation. Team 3D won the resulting tag match against Makabe and Yano to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship, thus making them 22-time tag-team champions. On January 4, 2010, at Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome Team 3D lost the IWGP Tag Team Title to No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro) in a three-way hardcore match, which also included Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson).

Starting in late 2013, Bully Ray and Devon have been something of a fixture within Tommy Dreamer&#x27;s House of Hardcore promotion. On November 9, 2013, at &quot;HoH 3&quot;, Bully Ray attacked Dreamer and Terry Funk following the main event, claiming that Dreamer offended him by not inviting him to the show, before challenging Dreamer to a falls-count-anywhere street fight at the TNA One Night Only pay-per-view event Old School. Spike Dudley came out to make the save only to be beaten by Bully as well, whereas Devon appeared to confront Bully—only to turn around and aid him as the two hit Dreamer with a 3D, then fended off an attempted save by the Sandman. Team 3D were also scheduled to officially team together against Dreamer and Abyss, then against Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Frankie Kazarian), on June 6 and 7, 2014 at &quot;House of Hardcore 4&quot; and &quot;5&quot; respectively. However, Bully Ray was pulled out of both events by TNA President Dixie Carter, turning the on-screen feud between Bully and Carter in TNA into a crossover storyline involving talent associated with both promotions. On July 13, 2014, Team 3D defeated Kevin Steen and Jason Axe to win the 2CW Tag Team Championship. On November 15, 2014, at HOH VII, Team 3D defeated NWA World Tag Team Champions Killer Elite Squad (Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Lance Archer).

=== Return to WWE (2015–2016) ===
On January 25, 2015, Bubba Ray made a one night appearance at Royal Rumble as a surprise entrant in the Rumble match, eliminating The Miz and R-Truth before being eliminated by Bray Wyatt.

On the August 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Bubba Ray and D-Von made their surprise return as the Dudley Boyz, where they reestablished themselves as fan favorites by attacking The New Day, giving a &quot;Dudley Death Drop&quot; to Xavier Woods through a table. On the August 27 episode of SmackDown, the Dudley Boyz wrestled their first match back in WWE, defeating The Ascension. At both Night of Champions and Live from Madison Square Garden, the Dudley Boyz challenged The New Day for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but won both matches by disqualification, which allowed The New Day to retain their titles. At Hell in a Cell, the Dudley Boyz challenged for the title again but were defeated by The New Day. At Survivor Series, the Dudley Boyz teamed with Goldust, Neville and Titus O&#x27;Neil to defeat Stardust, The Ascension, The Miz and Bo Dallas in a 5-on-5 traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match.

The following night on Raw, the Dudley Boyz suffered a defeat against Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper of The Wyatt Family. On the November 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, the Dudley Boyz faced The Wyatt Family again, beating Erick Rowan and Braun Strowman by disqualification after Harper attacked Bubba Ray and threw him through his own table. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, they had a no-contest six man tag team match against Harper, Rowan and Strowman when the Dudley Boyz teamed with the returning Tommy Dreamer. However, the Dudley Boyz and Dreamer fended off a post-match assault and threw Wyatt into a table. At , The ECW Originals were defeated by The Wyatt Family in an elimination tables match. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, the Dudley Boyz, Dreamer and Rhyno were defeated again by The Wyatt Family in an 8-man tag team Extreme Rules Match.
On the February 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Dudley Boyz turned heel when they attacked The Usos after an 8-man tag team tables match that also involving The New Day and Mark Henry. That same week on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, the Dudley Boyz proclaimed that their signature tables didn&#x27;t win all those Tag Team Championships for them, but rather they did it themselves, and thus, with the help of several stage-hands and staff members, they took all the tables they had out of the arena, going &quot;table-free&quot; for the first time in their careers. In the following weeks, the Dudley Boyz and The Usos began a feud, setting up a tag team match between the two teams on the WrestleMania 32 kickoff show, where the Dudley Boyz lost to The Usos. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, the Dudley Boyz defeated The Usos in a tables match, breaking their vow to never again use tables and officially ending the feud. Afterward the duo were interrupted by the debuting Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady, who proceeded to insult them and ignite a new feud. In a tournament to determine the number 1 contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship, they defeated The Lucha Dragons to advance to the semi-finals, where they lost to Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, the Dudley Boyz were drafted to &quot;Raw&quot;. At SummerSlam, they would lose to Sami Zayn and Neville.

On the August 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the day after SummerSlam, the Dudley Boyz departed from WWE. During their farewell segment, they were confronted by The Shining Stars. After receiving insults from The Shining Stars, the Dudley Boyz attacked them, turning face once again in the process. As they set up Primo for a 3D through a table, Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson attacked both Bubba Ray and D-Von, sending D-Von through the table with a Magic Killer.

===Return to independent circuit (2016)===
Team 3D competed at Insane Championship Wrestling&#x27;s (ICW) Fear and Loathing IX event on November 20, 2016 in an unsuccessful challenge for Polo Promotions&#x27; (Mark Coffey and Jackie Polo) ICW Tag Team Championships and at House of Glory on December 17, 2016. Devon retired shortly after, making this his final match. Devon returned to WWE shortly afterwards as a producer while Bully Ray would continue his in-ring career and sign with Ring of Honor.

=== WWE Hall of Fame (2018) ===

On January 22, 2018, on Raw 25 Years, The Dudley Boyz made a one night appearance by interrupting a tag team match between Heath Slater and Rhyno and Titus Worldwide (Apollo Crews and Titus O&#x27;Neil), giving a &quot;Whassup?&quot; and a &quot;Dudley Death Drop&quot; to Slater through a table.

On April 6, 2018, The Dudley Boyz were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Edge and Christian. At that point D-Von had retired from wrestling while Bubba Ray was still active.

=== Impact Wrestling (2023) ===
Team 3D reunited on the 1000th episode of Impact in a winning effort against The Desi Hit Squad. After the match, they put Rohit Raju through a table.

<text>Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppet Babies, commonly known by the shortened title Muppet Babies, is an American animated television series produced by Marvel Productions and Henson Associates. The show portrays toddler versions of the Muppets living together in a nursery under the care of a woman known as Nanny, involving the concepts of the power of imagination and creative problem-solving. The show&#x27;s main target group is for children aged 2–5. The idea of presenting the Muppets as children appeared in a dream sequence in &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984), released two months before &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; debuted. The idea was a success, and it transformed into a spin-off.

The show aired from September 15, 1984, to November 2, 1991, as part of the Saturday-morning cartoons lineup on CBS. The show received universal acclaim for its animation, visuals, writing, humor, educational values, and appeal to younger and older audiences. It spawned a successful merchandise and won seven Daytime Emmy Awards (including four consecutive awards for Outstanding Animated Program), as well as a Humanitas Prize. Due to its popularity, the show remained on television in the United States for a decade.

The rights are now held by The Walt Disney Company following the company&#x27;s acquisition of &quot;The Muppets&quot; franchise. Outside the United States, the show was distributed by Walt Disney Television. A reboot of the series premiered on Disney Junior on March 23, 2018.

==Premise==

The series stars Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal, Scooter, Skeeter, Rowlf the Dog, and Gonzo as toddlers. Supporting characters include Bunsen Honeydew, Beaker, and Camilla in the form of Gonzo&#x27;s stuffed chick. In the final two seasons, Bean Bunny and Statler and Waldorf made regular appearances. Several Muppets made guest appearances, including Janice as an older preteen and Kermit&#x27;s nephew Robin as a tadpole.

The Muppet Babies live in a large nursery watched over by Nanny, who is seen from the neck down. The babies&#x27; imaginary games transition from the nursery into scenes that become &quot;real&quot; to the babies, such as outer space and the past. The fantasies have the babies interact with live-action backgrounds, old films and photos, engravings, and hand-drawn backgrounds. The babies used their imaginations to have their own adventures based on everyday things and toys around them. They also use their imaginations to solve a problem.

In post-credits scenes, the babies are doing something related to the episode&#x27;s plot. Their activities (mostly Gonzo&#x27;s) are interrupted by Animal who crashes the scene in a comedic way and calls &quot;Go bye-bye!&quot;

==Episodes==


==Production==

===Origin===
The idea for the show was created by Jim Henson and his staff, originating in Jim Henson&#x27;s art department. During the creation of Sue Venning&#x27;s &quot;Muppet Show Bill&quot;, Jim Henson suggested to include the Muppets as &quot;tiny little selves and afterwards, as babies.&quot; The book was not changed, but the idea was described as &quot;charming&quot;. Afterwards, the staff, including Michael K. Frith, created character designs of the Muppets as toddlers. After Frith showed a sketch of Baby Piggy to Jim Henson, Henson decided to turn it into a line of merchandise. Throughout 1983, several marketers featured prototype versions of the Muppet Babies on merchandise such as infant and toddler clothing, nursery decor and diapers while Jim Henson was developing toddler versions of the characters. On January 1, 1984, the Muppet Babies were included in the comic strip adaptation of the Muppets.

During production of &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, Miss Piggy&#x27;s original fantasy sequence was written on the screenplay. Because Henson was enthused about the Muppet Babies, he convinced Frank Oz to include them in the film, replacing the original fantasy sequence. Despite Oz&#x27;s dislike of the idea, he thought that the idea was brilliant. Shortly afterwards, the art department asked the workshop to create models of the puppets of the Muppet Babies. The staff of the workshop favored the idea and decided to include them in the film. The scene was shot on August 28, 1983. It is considered to be one of the most difficult scenes to shoot during production of the film, as the puppeteers had to perform the baby versions of the characters by using their &quot;stubby little limbs.&quot; The film was released on July 13, 1984. The idea was a success, and it received very favorable reviews from fans. At the same time, Baby Kermit and Baby Piggy plush toys were promoted by Pampers.

A music video of Henson&#x27;s self-directed &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Always Love You&quot;, combined with scenes of the film and new footage, was created for MTV. The song was remixed by John Benitez for the project. It was shot on April 10 and 11, 1984. The set used for the music video was larger than the set used in the film. The video became an airplay hit and received a nomination for Best Achievement in Music Video in the VPA Monitor Awards in 1985. Additionally, Jim Henson received a nomination for Best Director for the video.

===Development===
Network executives and several others suggested Henson Associates to transform the Muppet Babies into a Saturday-morning cartoon. The concept of the show was created on March 10, 1984. On April 13, 1984, CBS colleague, Judy Price, granted permission to Jim Henson and his staff for its proposal. Jim Henson was initially skeptical, as he originally stepped away from Saturday-morning cartoons. However, he liked the idea a lot that he decided to create the show for something better. He visited every major studio in California, choosing to work with Marvel Productions after a meeting with Hank Saroyan. For the core theme of the show, Henson and Marvel Productions agreed to implement the theme of the power of creativity and encouragement of imagination. Bob Richardson transferred from producing and directing the first season of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, to produce and direct the show, which needed help getting started. Scooter&#x27;s twin sister, Skeeter, was exclusively created for the show to provide more feminine empowerment. Nanny was only seen from the neck down to represent the kids&#x27; view of an adult.

===Writing===
The team of writers consisted of Jeffrey Scott, Barry O&#x27;Brien, Bob Smith, Chuck Lorre, Sindy McKay, Larry Swerdlove, Star Kaplan, Maia Mattise, Barbara Beck, Stephen Robertson, Kathy Selbert, Rich Fogel, Mark Seidenberg, Ken Koonce, David Wiemers, Hank Saroyan, Lois Becker, Mark Stratton, J.R. Young, and Tony Marino. All of the writing scripts for the show were done in Marvel Productions. Jeffrey Scott wrote all 13 episodes of the first season.

===Voice actors===
The show had several cast members: Frank Welker, Laurie O&#x27;Brien, Greg Berg, Russi Taylor, Katie Leigh, Howie Mandel, Dave Coulier, and Barbara Billingsley. By the third season, Howie Mandel left the show, and his roles were given to Frank Welker as Baby Skeeter and Dave Coulier as Baby Animal and Baby Bunsen. All of the voices were recorded in various recording studios in Los Angeles.

Henson and other puppeteers, such as Frank Oz and Richard Hunt, decided not to reprise their roles due to scheduling conflicts with their work on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, and any Muppet special. The team decided to set up auditions for an amount of voice cast that would voice the characters for the series. According to Laurie O&#x27;Brien, the audition had gathered 750 people. Katie Leigh was a Muppets fan and did the audition process by renting one of the Muppet movies at a Blockbuster location and watching it. As Leigh was also a fan of Rowlf, she realized that she could do his voice. Although Leigh accidentally forgot to transform her impression into a baby, she was cast, as Hank Saroyan described her as &quot;one of the only people who really knew who Rowlf was.&quot; 

Laurie O&#x27;Brien did the audition process by imitating Baby Piggy with a mix between Miss Piggy and her &quot;million dollar voice&quot;, as well as Baby Gonzo, while watching a videocassette rental of &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; in her friend&#x27;s house. After auditioning with the videocassette player, O&#x27;Brien was cast as Baby Piggy due to her potential and physical strength with her character. Greg Breg, who was also a Muppets fan, did the audition process a few years after he moved to Hollywood. Some of the voice actors had no singing experience prior to the show&#x27;s production. Katie Leigh started taking singing lessons, while Howie Mandel needed a professional singer to help keep him on key.

===Animation===
Henson&#x27;s idea for its animation was to mix genres and ignore &quot;hard-and-fast rules.&quot; Characters and backgrounds were created by artists of Marvel Productions. Due to budget constraints, an idea was made by making Jeffrey Scott incorporate live-action footage and photographic backgrounds into the show to showcase reality of the imaginations. Film clips were also incorporated to encourage imagination and fantasy. The idea was well-liked, and it became one of the main concepts of the show, as it helped save money for animation. It was considered easy for Henson to secure the rights to films such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; since he was friends with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.

From the first season to the fifth episode of the fourth season, the series&#x27; overseas production was from Toei Animation, which it costed $30,000 per episode. In February 1985, Japanese yen started to rise against US dollars, and as a result, Toei Animation risen the cost to $50,000. AKOM was selected as an alternate, cheaper animation studio, animating the rest of the series.

===Music===
The show had approximately 100 of the songs co-written by Alan O&#x27;Day and Janis Liebhart. The theme song and &quot;Rocket to the Stars&quot; were written by Hank Saroyan and Rob Walsh, and &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;, &quot;Dreams for Your Inspiration&quot;, &quot;Camilla&quot;, and &quot;Best Friends&quot; were written by Scott Brownlee. The seventh season episode &quot;Sing a Song of Superheroes&quot; had nine minutes of songs that required extra recording studio work. Due to an limited amount of the cast having singing talents, all of the songs were recorded with separate voice sessions in a recording studio. Some songs were extended for the albums &quot;Rocket to the Stars&quot; and &quot;Music is Everywhere&quot;.

The songs mainly compose kiddie lyrics and familiar music genres. Themes of the songs include individuality, friendship, and art. During the first season, the show incorporated a &quot;doo-wop feel&quot; of the theme song to carry over the music. As the show evolved, more musical genres were incorporated, including a more contemporary sound, which often included parodies and references to popular songs at the time.

&quot;Amadogus&quot; (a parody of &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot; by Falco), a song featured in the third season episode &quot;Fozzie&#x27;s Family Tree&quot;, was released as a single in 1987 to promote the album &quot;Music is Everywhere&quot;. The song was chosen as a Featured Pick by &quot;Cashbox&quot;, stating that the &quot;playful tune could garner notoriety as a novelty hit.&quot; Bill Wedo of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; called the song &quot;particularly funny&quot;, but stated that &quot;kids will enjoy it [while] adults will find it a riot.&quot; Dee Ann Rexroat of &quot;The Gazette&quot; called the song as the &quot;best-of-show honors&quot; of the live show &quot;Muppet Babies&#x27; Live!&quot;.

==Themes==
The show focuses on the central ideas of the power of imagination and creative problem-solving to promote an educational concept of creativity. Hank Saroyan considered the idea as Jim Henson&#x27;s vision for children to &quot;believe that anything is possible.&quot; The techniques of imaginations contributed to the show, such as live-action footage and photographic backgrounds, was stated to interconnect ideas, stories, and characters in a dramatic play. Winnicott, a psychoanalytic theorist, described the show as &quot;the intermediate area... allowed to the infant between primary creativity and objective perception based on reality-testing.&quot; Author Marsha Kindle described the show&#x27;s techniques as the &quot;kind of transgressive identification across other borders&quot; and a &quot;specialty.&quot;

Other frequent themes involve books and reading, facing fears, new ways to play with old toys, imagining adulthood, and facing common childhood firsts. Diane LaBlanc of &quot;The Defender&quot; analyzed that the moral of the first-season episode &quot;Scooter&#x27;s Hidden Talent&quot; is finding and developing &quot;inspiration and talent&quot;. In the book &quot;Playing with Power in Movies, Television, and Games&quot;, the sixth-season episode &quot;The Green Ranger&quot; was analyzed for its transmedia intersexuality, commodified masquerade, obsolescence, and death to address readers who are concerned about children&#x27;s interactions on Saturday-morning shows. The seventh-season episode &quot;Sing a Song of Superheroes&quot; included popular opera arias to interest younger viewers in opera. The episode also served as an unofficial tribute to Jim Henson.

==Release==

===Broadcast===
&quot;Muppet Babies&quot; premiered on September 15, 1984, at 9:00 am (EST) as part of the Saturday-morning lineup on CBS. During the 1984–1985 television season, the show competed with NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Smurfs&quot;. The first-season episode &quot;Gonzo&#x27;s Video Show&quot; was shown as a primetime special on December 18, 1984. 

For a brief run in the second season, the program became &quot;Muppets, Babies, and Monsters&quot;, and a second half-hour was dedicated to a new show called &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Little Muppet Monsters&quot;. This show featured live-action puppets and cartoons starring the adult Muppet characters. The program ran from September 14 to September 28, 1985. At the time, the program faced competition with ABC&#x27;s &quot;Ewoks &amp; Star Wars Droids Adventure Hour&quot;. After three episodes, Jim Henson pulled the plug, despite airing only 18 episodes. This was reportedly due to the animation suffering from being produced quickly and the characters being lost in translation from live-action to animation, making the animation production harder for Marvel Productions to deliver the full season&#x27;s animated segments in time for airing. As a result, Henson and CBS was unhappy about the product. The show then reverted to two episodes of &quot;Muppet Babies.&quot; 

In the 1987–1988 television season, &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; was expanded to three episodes after CBS pulled &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; before it aired due to controversy.

On July 11, 1988, &quot;Broadcasting Magazine&quot; announced that the series would be syndicated on Claster Television for the 1989–1990 television season. The show officially debuted on the network on September 18, 1989. 

On January 3, 1989, Fox&#x27;s former vice-president, Steve Leblang, announced that the series would be acquired by Fox&#x27;s Children Network. On July 15, 1991, it was announced to re-run throughout the 1991–1992 television season on Fox after losing negotiations to continue syndicating on Claster Television, which was implied to have re-ran on the network throughout the 1990–1991 television season. As of August 4, 1991, the show&#x27;s debut date on the network was scheduled to be in September 1991. 

On October 5, 1992, the show started airing in re-runs on Nickelodeon. The show continued in re-runs on the network until December 31, 1998. On April 1, 1999, it was announced the series would air as part of Odyssey Network&#x27;s rebrand. The show reran on Odyssey Network from April 4, 1999, to March 2000.

In 2003, four episodes were made available, in uncut form, as bonus DVDs with 10-inch &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; plush toys distributed by Toy Play: &quot;The Daily Muppet&quot;, &quot;Eight Take Away One Equals Panic&quot;, &quot;Piggy&#x27;s Hyper-Activity Book&quot;, and &quot;Gonzo&#x27;s Video Show&quot;. There have been no plans announced of other DVD releases of &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;. In 2023, animator Guy Gilchrist confirmed that &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; would least likely be available for streaming due to copyright and trademark difficulties.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Throughout the show&#x27;s run, it received universal acclaim from critics. After its debut, David Bianculli of Knight-Ridder Newspapers commented that it is one of the two Saturday-morning cartoons that &quot;sound promising [compared to the other two programs]&quot; and praised the show as a &quot;wonderful addition to the Saturday-morning roster.&quot; Mike Hughes of Garnett News Service ranked the show as one of the two best Saturday-morning shows of 1984, describing the Muppet Babies as &quot;cute&quot; and the script as &quot;fresh and funny&quot;. He praised the script as &quot;much better than [other Saturday-morning shows].&quot; In his &quot;On TV&quot; review on &quot;The Reporter Dispatch&quot; issue from October 21, 1984, he also commented that the writing &quot;ranks up&quot; with &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot; and &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;. Steve McKerrow of &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; stated that the show is a &quot;standout&quot; to &quot;cheaply-executed&quot; Saturday-morning cartoons and described it as a &quot;cartoon outgrowth [...] that makes [the audience] wish all children&#x27;s programs could be this good.&quot; He also stated that it is the &quot;kind of show that puts the bulk of the Saturday line-up to shame&quot;. He praised the show as &quot;clever&quot; and &quot;honestly funny&quot;, commenting that the show takes a &quot;floor-level, child&#x27;s-eye view of the world&quot;. He also praised the Muppet Babies as &quot;well and colorfully animated&quot;. Later, on his article from September 28, 1985, he commented that the program &quot;Muppets, Babies &amp; Monsters&quot; is a &quot;welcome addition to the [Saturday-morning] lineup.&quot;

Television critic Rick Forchuk reviewed that the show is &quot;vastly better than [any primetime shows] in [the 1984–1985 television season].&quot; He described the show as &quot;different&quot; and a &quot;throwback to a different time&quot;. He also praised the animation as &quot;superb, three dimensional, and vivid&quot; and the plot and stories as &quot;unpredictable&quot; and &quot;exciting as anything&quot;. He concluded that it is a &quot;great show for adults [and] kids.&quot; Walt Belcher of &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; commented that the show is &quot;[one of the] few bright spots [of Saturday-mornings]&quot; and described it as &quot;pleasant&quot;. In her initial review, Ellen Klein of Kids &#x27;N&#x27; TV criticized its visuals as &quot;not startling&quot;, but commented that the show has &quot;enough originality to make it stand out to other Saturday-morning cartoons&quot;. In her revised review from 1985, she gave it a perfect 4 out of 4 stars, welcoming &quot;Muppets, Babies &amp; Monsters&quot; as an exception to the Saturday-morning trend &quot;full of robots, monsters, wrestlers, ghosts, and super-powered Galactic Guardians [that appealed] to older children.&quot; She described the series as &quot;fun&quot;, &quot;inventive&quot;, and &quot;exciting without being threatening or scary.&quot; She concluded that the series is &quot;one of the best [on Saturday-mornings].&quot; Howard Rosenberg of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that &quot;Muppets, Babies &amp; Monsters&quot; was the &quot;best Saturday-morning kid [program]&quot;, describing it as &quot;wonderful&quot;. Ron Weiskind of &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; called the show the &quot;most imaginative cartoon on the tube these days.&quot; Bill Wedo of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; commented that the songs &quot;manage [Henson&#x27;s magic to entertain children and adults].&quot; Susan Stewart of &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; rated the series a perfect four stars, reviewing that it is a &quot;vast improvement over [the] first-generation Muppets.&quot;

The show was also well received by fans and audiences. In a Critics-at-Large review from May 5, 1985, Maria E. Allman from Hamburg, New York, called the show a &quot;clever offering&quot; and praised Baby Kermit, Baby Piggy, and Baby Gonzo for providing &quot;humor and antics&quot;. She concluded that it is a &quot;treat&quot; and a &quot;relief&quot; for &quot;parents and grandparents who have grown tired of the unappetizing fare and superhero junk[...]&quot; In 1986, a survey in Woodrow Wilson School and Nellie F. Bennett School stated that their children&#x27;s top-ranked show was &quot;Muppets, Babies &amp; Monsters&quot;.

===Ratings===
&quot;Muppet Babies&quot; proved highly popular with audiences. In the 1984–1985 television season, the show was ranked as the most popular Saturday-morning cartoon on CBS and in the top five of 42 network shows. It was also ranked fifth on the most popular Saturday-morning show of the season. On December 18, 1984, the primetime broadcast of &quot;Gonzo&#x27;s Video Show&quot; received a 9.9 Nielsen rating with a share of 15%. In 1985, the program &quot;Muppets, Babies &amp; Monsters&quot; was rated No. 1 on CBS. After the program was replaced by two episodes of &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, the ratings increased from the previous season. The series remained as CBS&#x27;s number-one Saturday-morning show. As of 1986, it was the second most popular children&#x27;s programming among the top 30, and it attracted more than four million audiences on each week. It was also very popular with licensees at the time.

Despite the success, ratings has decreased over time. In the 1989–1990 television season, the show only garnered a 2.4 Nielsen household rating with a 14% share due to competition with &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; at the time. Despite the decrease in ratings, the show still had success with the 2-11 and 6-11 age groups, garnering a 4.6 Nielsen rating with a 55% share in the 2-11 age group and a 4.9 Nielsen rating with a 63% share in the 6-11 age group.

===Accolades===
Between 1985 and 1991, &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; gained twelve awards from 27 nominations, including four consecutive Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program. On August 1, 1985, the show became the first recipient to receive an award for Outstanding Animated Program at the Daytime Emmy Awards. It continued to win the category until 1989, holding a record for the most wins in the category (tied with &quot;Arthur&quot;). In 1985, Jeffrey Scott received a Humanitas Prize for the first-season episode &quot;Eight Take Away One Equals Panic&quot;, which earned him a $10,000 prize.
===Honors===
&quot;Muppet Babies&quot; was voted &quot;Top Cartoon of the Childhood Days&quot; by the Irvin Hall newspaper&#x27;s weekly review of the Pennsylvania State University in 2007.

In January 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; named &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppet Babies&quot; as the 31st-best in the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows.

==Impact and legacy==
&quot;Muppet Babies&quot; was known to start a trend of relaunching popular cartoon characters as younger versions of themselves. This trend can be seen in numerous TV series such as &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;The Flintstone Kids&quot;, &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot;, &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; (based on characters from Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;) and &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot;.

As of 2000, approximately 300,000 animation cels of the show were stored by the Jim Henson Company Archives off-site.

In 2007, a specific case dedicated to the show was added in The Jim Henson Exhibit in Leland, Mississippi.

==Other media==

===Albums===
The first album, &quot;Rocket to the Stars&quot;, was released in July 1985 by Parker Brothers Music on LP and cassette. It featured an outer space adventure with eleven original songs starring the &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; characters. The songs and dialogue were mixed by Hank Saroyan, Rob Walsh, and Geni Jackson at Wilder Brothers Studio. It was reissued on July 20, 1987, by Columbia Records. The album, renamed &quot;Rock It to the Stars&quot;, was re-released in September 1993 by Jim Henson Records on CD and cassette. Sandra Tompkins of &quot;The Fresno Bee&quot; called the album an &quot;exciting Oz-like journey&quot;, praising the songs as &quot;catchy sing-alongs&quot;. Peter Fawthrop of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, praising the songs and voices, but criticized the storybook format of the album, including the &quot;dramatic lengths&quot; and &quot;loaded dialogue&quot;. The second album, &quot;Music is Everywhere&quot;, was released on July 20, 1987, by Columbia Records on LP and cassette. Doug Hoagland of &quot;The Fresno Bee&quot; praised the music as &quot;catchy&quot;.

===Comics===
In 1985, Marvel Comics produced a monthly comic book of the &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; with their Star Comics imprint, drawn by Marie Severin. The idea was created by Guy Gilchrist, who submitted approximately twenty samples to Jim Jenson, along with a multi-panel strip. The series lasted for 26 issues. The last two issues, #25 (May 1989) and #26 (July 1989), were drawn by Nate Butler. In 1992, Harvey Comics acquired the rights to produce &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; comics and produced a further three issues (restarting at issue #1).

The Muppet Babies also appeared in &quot;Star Comics Digest&quot; (also known as &quot;Star Comics Magazine&quot;). This comic was printed in digest-size format, and features a number of reprinted short stories in each issue. The series itself lasted for thirteen issues from 1986 until 1988. The Muppet Babies appeared in some, but not all, of the issues.

===Live performances===
&quot;Muppet Babies&quot; had three live performances produced between 1986 and 1990. They are produced by Bob Shipstad and VEE Corporation. Each tour involved 16 cast members, eight crew members, concession staff, and support office staff. All of the voices and music were pre-recorded, and the costumes were designed and produced in Henson Associates, to retain authenticity. &quot;Muppet Babies Live!&quot; premiered on August 28, 1986, at Ohio Center in Columbus, Ohio. The same premise followed with &quot;Muppet Babies&#x27; Magic Box&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Muppet Babies&#x27; Where&#x27;s Animal?&quot; in 1988, which ended in May 1990 after 40 cities. The production values built in Minneapolis, including the sets, properties, costumes, and lightings, cost $1 million.

Professional dancers auditioned in New York City, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis to fill in roles. Approximately 600 people auditioned for the live performances per year. The cast would rehearse in Minneapolis for up to 10 hours per day in three weeks. Andrew Carl Wilk, director of the live performances, stated that directing them from prerecorded voices to costumes and movements was difficult. The production stage would be constructed with sets, properties, and lighting for four to seven hours for each destination. The dancers were transported by a chartered bus on each Monday and had a day off on each Tuesday. When the tours ended, they traveled back to their homes across the United States six times.

The live performances received critical acclaim. In her review of &quot;Muppet Babies&#x27; Live!&quot;, Sara Ann Conkling of &quot;Special to the Free Press&quot; praised Hank Saroyan&#x27;s sketches as &quot;full of color, sound, and activity.&quot; She also described the dancers as &quot;remarkably agile&quot; and added that the &quot;special lighting effects added to the sense of wonderment.&quot; Dee Ann Rexroat of &quot;The Gazette&quot; commented that &quot;Muppet Babies&#x27; Live!&quot; is not &quot;something parents have to suffer through&quot;, calling the live show &quot;well produced&quot; and &quot;cute&quot; and the sets and costumes as &quot;quite imaginative&quot;. Dave Tianen of &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot; commented that &quot;Muppet Babies&#x27; Live!&quot; is &quot;colorful, fast-paced, gentle, bright, tuneful, and mercifully short.&quot; In his review of &quot;Muppet Babies&#x27; Magic Box&quot;, Bill Wedo of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; reviewed that the show was &quot;true to the original&quot;, praising the scene changes as &quot;quick and clever&quot;. He also praised the &quot;Star Trek&quot; skit as the &quot;beauty of the show&quot;, stating that &quot;grown-ups can find kid stuff entertaining, too.&quot; In her review of &quot;Muppet Babies&#x27; Where&#x27;s Animal?&quot;, Esther Benenson of &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; commented that parents &quot;[will] have trouble getting excited about the plot&quot; and have a &quot;hard time adjusting to the piercingly high voice of Baby Piggy&quot;, describing the plot as &quot;sparse&quot; and praising some of the medleys as &quot;entertaining&quot;.

==2018 reboot==

On October 26, 2016, it was announced that a reboot of the series began production. As opposed to the traditional animation of the original show, the reboot used CGI and is targeted to children ages 4–7 with each episode consisting of two 11-minute stories. Mr. Warburton, creator of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, served as the executive producer while former &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; writer Eric Shaw served as the story editor. A reboot of the series premiered on Disney Junior on March 23, 2018.

==Other appearances==
In 1987, the live-action version of the lead characters appeared, in the form of an old home movie, during &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot;. The segment itself was cut from American and Canadian home video releases due to copyright licensing issues with &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;.

In 1990, Baby Kermit, Piggy, and Gonzo made small appearances in the drug prevention television special &quot;Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue&quot;.

<text>The Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art (RLAHA) is a laboratory at the University of Oxford, England which develops and applies scientific methods to the study of the past. It was established in 1955 and its first director was Teddy Hall. The first deputy director was Dr Stuart Young, who was followed by Martin Aitken in 1957. After many years of de facto association with the Institute of Archaeology, in 2000 it was jointly brought under the single departmental umbrella of School of Archaeology.

The laboratory includes the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU), which carries out radiocarbon dating using an accelerator mass spectrometer. The Laboratory publishes the journal &quot;Archaeometry&quot;, and hosts a chair named for its first director, Edward Hall Professorship in Archaeological Science, and a seminar series named for Martin Aitkin.

The Laboratory is currently directed by Professor Mark Pollard.

== Areas of Research, Past and Present ==
* Radiocarbon dating
* Luminescence dating
* Materials analysis
* Palaeodiet
* Archaeological geophysics
* Uranium-series dating
* Diagenesis
*Tephrachronology

== History of Directorship ==

* Teddy Hall, 1955–1989.
* Mike Tite, 1989–2004.
*Mark Pollard, 2004–2014.
*Christopher Bronk Ramsey 2014–2019.
*Mark Pollard, 2019–Present.

== Edward Hall Professorship in Archaeological Science ==
In 1989, when Teddy Hall retired, the laboratory was placed in jeopardy. In order for the university to agree to the funding of the Deputy Directorship in 1955, Hall, who was independently wealthy, forfeited his own salary. Knowing that his replacement would require funding, he launched an appeal and raised a million pound endowment for a chair, the now eponymous Edward Hall Professorship in Archaeological Science.

The first to take this chair was a previous student of Martin Aitken&#x27;s, Mike Tite, who also worked with the pair on dating the Turin Shroud. Tite was Edward Hall Professor from 1989, until his retirement in 2004. He was replaced by Mark Pollard, who remains in post.

<text>About six months after the United States invasion of Iraq of 2003, rumors of Iraq prison abuse scandals started to emerge.

The best known abuse incidents occurred at the large Abu Ghraib prison. Graphic pictures of some of those abuse incidents were made public. Less well-known abuse incidents have been documented at American prisons throughout Iraq.

==Iraqi prisons where abuse incidents have been documented==

==Official investigations into abuse incidents==

==Timeline of events==

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the coalition forces regularly use &quot;torture-like&quot; methods during the interrogation of suspects. Such methods were reportedly applied to people to find the hiding place of Saddam Hussein in Operation Red Dawn. British troops have also on occasion been accused of abusing Iraqi detainees. Such treatment violates article 17 of the Third Geneva Convention and the USA and Britain&#x27;s official policies on combat and occupation. Despite numerous complaints by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, it took a year before the first US soldier was court-martialed for their actions concerning abuse of Iraqis.

Eight marine reservists were investigated for abuse and the death of a prisoner, outside Nasiriyah.

A photograph leaked after the initial set shows Spc. Sabrina Harman smiling and giving a thumbs up next to the body of Manadel al-Jamadi. Jamadi was reportedly beaten to death during interrogations in the prison&#x27;s showers.
Death certificates repeatedly stated that prisoners had died &quot;while sleeping&quot;, and of &quot;natural reasons&quot;. Iraqi doctors are not allowed to investigate the deaths of prisoners, even if death certificates are allegedly forged. No investigations against US military doctors who are alleged to have forged death certificates have been reported.

===Spring 2003===
A US veteran sergeant reports witnessing torture of journalists and writers all over Iraq. Kurdistan region was not an exception. Writers without Borders embarrassed the Iraqi government quite frequently in reports covering minority, women and marginalised Iraqis from all over the country but with much focus on Baghdad, Karkuk, Salahedin and Mosul.

Honorably discharged US veteran, Sergeant Frank &quot;Greg&quot; Ford reports that he witnessed war crimes in Samarra, Iraq. According to Ford, several members of his own unit, the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade participated in the torture of Iraqi detainees as young as 14.

Ather Karen al-Mowafakia died in Basra, while in British custody. Details about the investigation are not known.

Gary Bartlam, a British soldier of the 7th Armoured Brigade, was arrested after submitting film to a photo developers shop in Tamworth, England while on leave. The photographs depict a gagged Iraqi POW suspended hanging by rope from a fork lift, and other pictures seem to show prisoners being forced to perform sexual acts. Bartlam and two other soldiers were convicted at court martial of abuse - a fourth soldier was cleared.

British Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins was alleged by US Army Major Re Biastre to have been responsible for mistreatment of Iraqi civilians and prisoners of war. Lieutenant Colonel Collins was later cleared of any wrongdoing by an MOD investigation.

===May 2003===
In separate incidents, the Royal Military Police declared that Radhi Natna died of a heart attack while in British custody, yet his family reports that he had no heart trouble; and the Black Watch regiment arrested the 17-year-old Ahmad Jabber Kareem Ali in Basra, who then drowned after being ordered to swim across a river despite not being able to swim, according to his friend Ayad Salim Hanoon.

Army Reservists abused Prisoners at Camp Bucca, and were later court-martialed.

Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead III reported that Master Sergeant Lisa Marie Girman, a state trooper, &quot;repeatedly kick[ed a prisoner] in the groin, abdomen and head, and encouraging her subordinate soldiers to do the same,&quot;

Lieutenant Colonel Vic Harris reported that Staff Sergeant Scott A. McKenzie who worked at a Pennsylvania Department of Corrections boot-camp-style prison, and Specialist Timothy F. Canjar: held prisoners&#x27; legs, encouraged others to then kick them in the groin, stepped on their previously injured arms, and made false sworn statements to the Army Criminal Investigation Division.

They received &quot;general under honorable conditions&quot; discharges, were ordered to forfeit two months&#x27; salary, and returned to the United States.

Sergeant Shawna Edmondson, also involved in the case, received an &quot;other-than-honorable&quot; discharge, after she requested it instead of being court-martialed.

Hossam Shaltout said the abuse at Camp Bucca was similar to that at Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, and that his torture included scorpions placed on his body.

Said Shabram died in custody, but no information of the investigation were made public.

===July to December 2003===
American forces detained the family of an unidentified lieutenant general to induce him to turn himself in.

The abuses at Abu Ghraib prison were reportedly committed by MPs. There are allegations that private contractors contributed to them as well and that intelligence agencies such as the CIA ordered them to do so in order to break prisoners for interrogations. It is said to be a usual practice in other US prisons as well, such as in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.

The International Committee of the Red Cross submitted a detailed report to the U.S. Army in October 2003 about abuses in prisons, and the president of the Red Cross stated he had informed high-ranking members of the Bush administration about the abuses during a meeting in the White House in January 2004. A soldier came forward that month with photos of abuse that he found disturbing, some showed the stacking of prisoners into a human pyramid, with one prisoner&#x27;s skin visibly bearing a slur written in English. Another showed a prisoner being forced to stand on a box with wires attached to his head and hands, who had reportedly been told that if he fell off the box, he would be electrocuted. Photos released to the public later included a person being attacked by a guard dog, which the soldier involved described as being useful for intimidation of prisoners. It was also reported that an Iraqi hired as a translator raped a juvenile male prisoner while a female soldier took pictures. No charges have been brought against the contractor because he does not fall under military jurisdiction; it is questionable whether any charges will or even can be brought against him.

Donald Rumsfeld had said that army and government had only been informed in January and not in detail. On January 16, 2004, a press release was issued by the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) stating that an investigation had been initiated in response to allegations of detainee abuse at an unspecified detention facility (now known to be Abu Ghraib prison).

In March 2004, 6 soldiers in Abu Ghraib were charged with dereliction of duty, cruelty and maltreatment, and sexual abuse. 17 others were suspended from duty, including the seven U.S. officers who ran the prison. Also recommended for discipline was Brig. Gen Janis Karpinski, the commander of the 800th brigade. The Red Cross, which had access to these prisons, has stated that the instances of torture were not aberrations but were systemic. Some officers have attempted to defend themselves by saying that they were only doing their duty.

In response to ongoing complaints, the US military initiated a program to reform the internment and treatment systems. The reforms are expected to increase safeguards for prisoners&#x27; rights, to ensure each prisoner receives a copy of their internment order, and has their charges explained to them within 72 hours. They additionally plan to publicly post information about detainees so that family members can know what happened to their loved ones. Reforms were made in March 2004.

Theft of prisoner&#x27;s possessions by soldiers, dirty, cramped quarters and bad food, prisoners forced into uncomfortable positions for prolonged periods of time, extreme exposure to the elements, and excessive jailings of people based on the paid testimony of individual informants were reported. 55-year-old cafe owner Mahmoud Khodair, who was arrested and held for six months before being released in early March without ever knowing what he was charged with, stated, &quot;It was just like hell&quot;, and &quot;Nothing has changed since Saddam. Before, the Mukhabarat [secret police] would take us away, and at least they wouldn&#x27;t blow down the door. Now, some informant fingers you and gets $100 even if you&#x27;re innocent.&quot;

During April 2004 the media started to report on the abuse. The journalist Seymour Hersh (who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his disclosure of the Vietnam War tragedy at the hamlet of My Lai) published a series of articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; with photo coverage of U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison on 2004-04-30.

In an interview with Dan Rather, the deputy director of operations for the US-led coalition, Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, stated &quot;We&#x27;re appalled. These are our fellow soldiers. These are the people we work with every day. They represent us. They wear the same uniform as us, and they let their fellow soldiers down. If we can&#x27;t hold ourselves up as an example of how to treat people with dignity and respect, we can&#x27;t ask that other nations do that to our soldiers.&quot;

On May 1, 2004, photos of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq being abused and humiliated by United States soldiers provoke an international outrage.

Furthering the charges, excerpts from the Abu Ghraib Taguba report were published on May 3, 2004. The report documented: the sodomizing of a prisoner with a chemical light, pouring phosphoric liquid on detainees, rape of a female prisoner, forced masturbation, &quot;ghost detainees&quot; moved around to avoid the Red Cross, and many other abuses.

The release of the photographs and reports had led to renewed calls for investigations into the abuses reported in other US military prisons, such as Camp X-Ray and Camp Delta.

On May 14, 2004, reporters for the Guardian documented a coercive technique which soldiers called &quot;bitch in a box&quot;. The prisoner was shoved into the trunk of a car on a hot day, and driven around until the prisoner was near ready to pass out. Another technique documented was &quot;waterboarding&quot;, which involves water being poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. They also interviewed many soldiers not involved in the current scandal, who claimed that they were taught to use sleep deprivation, to stage mock executions, and to use other procedures. One platoon leader who objected to these practices was reportedly told that his stand could end his military career.

USA Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told an armed services committee of the Senate on 2004-05-07 that &quot;There are a lot more photographs and videos that exist [...] I looked at them last night and they&#x27;re hard to believe [...] The pictures I&#x27;ve seen depict conduct, behaviour that is so brutal and so cruel and so inhumane that anyone engaged in it or involved in it would have to be brought to justice.&quot; He also said that the abused detainees may be offered compensation.

In a scene described as &quot;surreal&quot; by AFP, it was found in mid May, 2004 that US troops were handing out cash to freed prisoners along with a note stating &quot;You have not been mistreated.&quot;. A reporter visiting the prison Camp War Horse described the tour:

:&quot;Have you been mistreated?&quot; the governor asks the detainees, dressed in orange boilersuits.

:&quot;No. We have never been tortured,&quot; chorused those behind bars as some 50 soldiers stood nearby.

===August 2003===
It was claimed that eleven Iraqis had been severely beaten by members of the SAS in Majar al-Kabir; they were released and paid compensation for their injuries.

Sadiq Zoman, 57, is delivered in a vegetative state, to a hospital in Tikrit. His body bearing telltale signs of torture: burn marks on his skin, bludgeon marks on the back of his head, a badly broken thumb, electrical burns on the soles of his feet. Additionally, family members say they found whipmarks across his back and more electrical burns on his genitalia. He had entered US custody healthy barely 1 month earlier.

Hassan Abbad Said died in custody, but no information of the investigation were made public.

===September 2003===
Corporal Donald Payne of the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment now the 1st Battalion, Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (King&#x27;s, Lancashire and Border), became Britain&#x27;s first convicted war criminal after pleading guilty to abusing Iraqi detainees, which resulted in the death of one detainee Baha Mousa.

===November 2003===

An al Jazeera cameraman, Salah Hassan, reported various abuses in the infamous Abu Ghraib prison complex, such as being forced to strip naked, standing up for 11 hours and being kicked when he collapsed, being forced to wear a vomit-covered jumpsuit, and many other abuses. He later also witnessed a 12- or 13-year-old girl who was stripped naked and beaten. Her brother was held in another cell and heard her screams.

===January 2004===
January 3: Marwan Hassoun and his cousin Zaydun Al-Samarrai are taken from their broken-down truck at about curfew time and forced to jump from the Tharthar dam into the Tigris River; the latter drowns. First Lt. Jack M. Saville and Sgt. 1st Class Tracy E. Perkins were charged on 2004 June 7 with manslaughter, assault, conspiracy, making false statements, and obstruction of justice. Sgt. Reggie Martinez was charged three weeks later with manslaughter and for making false statements, and Spec. Terry Bowman with assault and making false statements. Martinez&#x27; and Bowman&#x27;s charges were dropped; Perkins got six months in jail. Saville was jailed (45 days) and fined $12,000 for assault but he remained on active duty until his military obligation was fulfilled.

====&quot;Daily Mirror&quot; false allegations====
Alleged photographs of prisoner abuses by UK troops were published by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; within 48 hours of the breaking of the story of abuses by US troops in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.

General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, said &quot;if proven, the perpetrators are not fit to wear the Queen&#x27;s uniform and they have besmirched the Army&#x27;s good name and conduct&quot;.

The authenticity of the photographs was called into question a day later. In particular, a number of specifics in the images, such as the type of rifles the soldiers in the pictures are carrying and the type of truck pictured did not match the equipment used by UK troops in Iraq. The &quot;Mirror&quot; responded to these criticisms of the photographs on May 3, 2004.

On May 14, 2004, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that the pictures it had published, allegedly showing UK troops abusing an Iraqi prisoner, were fake and that &quot;the Daily Mirror has been the subject of a calculated and malicious hoax.&quot; The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; editor, Piers Morgan, was sacked due to the controversy.

====Rape Accusations====
On May 11, 2004, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; covered a press conference by Boston City Councilor Chuck Turner and local civil rights activist Sadiki Kambon during which they distributed photographs they alleged showed American soldiers raping Iraqi woman. In its early editions on May 12, photographs from the event clearly showed some of the pictures presented, the Globe later apologized for the error. Other news agencies quickly responded to the story by linking the photographs to American and Hungarian pornography sites. Several sources stated that Iraqi females, including teenage girls, were sexually assaulted while being detained at Abu Ghraib and other US military detention facilities across Iraq. American journalist Tara McKelvey, writing for the magazine The American Prospect, interviewed an Iraqi sheik in the fall of 2004 about this issue and he told her that &quot;he had seen a young girl, 15 years old, with internal bleeding. She had been raped over and over again by the soldiers, and she could no longer talk. He is a deeply religious man. But that night, he shouted at Allah. ‘How is it possible that you are there and these things are happening?!&#x27; he said.”

====Amnesty International report====
Amnesty International has alleged that the MOD has refused to properly investigate allegations of war crimes committed by their troops.

===February 2004===
Death in U.S. custody of chemistry professor Mohammed Munim al-Izmerly. An autopsy concluded death was caused by a sudden hit to the back of his head and that the cause of death was blunt trauma.

===June 2004===
The Pentagon confirms a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that CIA chief George Tenet was allowed by U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to have an Iraqi prisoner secretly detained at Camp Cropper in November, preventing the International Committee of the Red Cross from monitoring their treatment, a possible violation of the Geneva Conventions.

June 29: Oregon national guardsmen intervene in the beating of bound prisoners on the grounds of the Iraqi Interior Ministry; are told to back off and let the newly &quot;sovereign&quot; Iraqis run their own affairs.

===July 2004===
The International Red Cross reports that more than 100 children were kept in six different prisons of the coalition. Witnesses say US forces also abused children and youths. Soldier Samuel Provance from Abu Ghraib reported the harassment of a 15- to 16-year-old girl in her cell as well as a 16-year-old boy who was driven through the cold after he had been showered and who was then covered with mud. Allegations have been made that children have been subjected to torture and rape. This has been used to make detained parents talk in cases where other interrogation methods have failed. Seymour Hersh told a San Francisco audience: &quot;what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys, children, in cases that have been [video] recorded, the boys were sodomized, with the cameras rolling... the worst above all of them is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking.&quot; An unpublished UNICEF report is said to include statements about children that were arrested in Basra and Kerbela and routinely detained in Umm Kasr. The children are said to be without contact to their families and cannot expect a trial.

===August 2004===
Death penalty &quot;reluctantly&quot; reinstated in Iraq &quot;until stability [is] restored.&quot;

===December 2004===
Reports of mock executions by the US Marines in Iraq have surfaced in December 2004, as the ACLU published internal documents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The documents were written seven weeks after the publication of the photographs which triggered the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal.

Several torture cases were also reported, notably torture by electricity, beatings, and sprayings of prisoners with fire extinguishers.

On 21 December, the ACLU released further documents documenting tortures. Notably, in a case of shooting of suspects without warning, Army commanders are reported to have interfered with the investigation. Procedures of autopsy of detainees who died in unclear circumstances have been canceled by battalion and group commands. Other cases include 
*An apparent attempt by a soldier in Baghdad to force a detainee to hold a gun to create the appearance of a justifiable homicide.
*Two mock executions of Iraqi juveniles by Army personnel (documents obtained by the ACLU two weeks ago showed that U.S. Marines had also conducted a mock execution of juvenile detainees).
*Allegations of a competition among Army dog handlers at Abu Ghraib prison to see who could make Iraqi detainees urinate themselves the fastest.
*The use of death threats during interrogations. Command failures in providing appropriate training to military interrogators in Baghdad detention facilities.

===January 2005===
On 24 January 2005, the ACLU accused the Pentagon of deliberately closing investigations over Human Rights violations and torture cases before they were over.

Human Rights Watch accused Iraqi security forces of using torture and improper treatments on prisoners. Arbitrary arrests and long periods of isolation are now common. Human Right Watch interviewed 90 prisoners, among which 72 said they had been tortured during interrogation. Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW director, said that the Iraqi provisional government was not holding to its promise to stand by Human Rights: 
&quot;A new Iraqi government requires more than a change of leadership - it requires a change of attitude about basic human dignity&quot;. 

&quot;During the first three days there was continuous torture. I was beaten with an aluminum rod and with cables. ? Then I was told to sign a statement with my hands tied behind my back, so I didn&#x27;t even see the paper and I don&#x27;t know what I signed.&quot;

Among bad treatments were such elements as beatings with cables, electric shocks, including on genitals, being tied and blindfolded for days, cells so crowded that it is only possible to stand, arbitrary detention, refusal of trials, access to lawyers or contacts with families. These treatments were inflicted to insurgents and criminals alike.

===May 2005===
A Pentagon order is mentioned in a military report filed on May 16, 2005 ordering U.S. personnel to turn a blind eye to Iraqi torture by refraining from investigating instances of apparent detainee abuse by Iraqi personnel, unless the investigation is first approved by U.S. headquarters: &quot;Provided the initial report confirms US forces were not involved in the detainee abuse, no further investigation will be conducted unless directed by HHQ.&quot; Such approval was rarely granted.

===September 2005===
In a report published by Human Rights Watch in September 2005, U.S. Troops are accused to routinely torture prisoners in Iraq. Two sergeants and a captain describe e.g. the breaking of a detainee’s leg, and applying chemical substances to detainees’ skin and eyes. Capt. Ian Fishback of the 82nd Airborne who made persistent efforts over 17 months to raise concerns about detainee abuse with his chain of command was consistently told to ignore abuses and to “consider your career.” When he made an appointment with Senate staff members of Senators John McCain and John Warner, he says his commanding officer denied him a pass to leave his base.

===November 2005===
-173 detainees found in an Iraqi government bunker in Baghdad were found starved, beaten and tortured.

-Colin Powell&#x27;s former Chief of Staff, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, stated in an interview with Amy Goodman on November 22 that:

:&quot;the difficulties [our troops face] come from the two decisions that I had the most insight into that were made in this more or less alternative decision-making process. And those two decisions were the inept and incompetent planning for post-invasion Iraq, and [...] the decision... from that alternative decision-making process to depart from the Geneva Conventions and from international law, in general.

:&quot;[The President&#x27;s memorandum said] the spirit of Geneva would be adhered to... consistent with military necessity. [...] It did not say &#x27;consistent with national security demands.&#x27; It did not say &#x27;consistent with the demands of the war on terror.&#x27; It said &#x27;consistent with military needs.&#x27; Now, military needs are very simple and clear to a man like me who spent 31 years in the military. It means that if one of my buddy&#x27;s life is threatened or my life is threatened, I can take drastic action. I can even shoot a detainee. And I can expect not to be punished under Geneva, or at least if I am court-martialed, I have a defense. It doesn&#x27;t mean that I can take a detainee in a cold, dark cell in Bagram, Afghanistan, for example, in December 2002, shackled to the wall, and pour cold water on him at intervals when the outside temperature is 50 degrees anyway, and eventually kill him, which is what happened.&quot;&quot;

The Haditha killings occurred on November 19 in the town of Haditha, Iraq. A convoy of United States Marines was attacked with an improvised explosive device which killed Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas. Up to twenty-four Iraqis were subsequently killed; it is alleged that they were non-combatant local residents who were massacred by Marines in the aftermath of the insurgent attack.

===December 2005===
John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), told Reuters that there were an estimated 14,000 people being held in prison in Iraq contrary to UN Resolution 1546, according to which the US government claims legal permission to occupy Iraq. In a December 5, 2005, interview, Pace said,

:&quot;All [prisoners in Iraq] except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison.

:&quot;Essentially none of these people have any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in the protection of the individual in this country.

:&quot;It&#x27;s very rare to get judges ordering you to be released and effectively the police respecting that order.

:&quot;We have cases also where the judge who has ordered a group of people to be released, about 50-60 people, and the police, the Interior Ministry simply refuses.

:&quot;We have another case in another part of the country where the judge was actually the subject of reprisal for having found people not getting, as ordered, their release.

:&quot;The judge is now in jail.

:&quot;The judiciary has a lot to answer for in this country. It is really not carrying out its duties,&quot; he said, adding that bribes were sometimes paid for jobs in the judiciary and police.

:&quot;This is not denied,&quot; Pace said. &quot;This is symptomatic of the corruption problems in this country and stands in the way of any kind of rule of law.&quot;

===June 2006===
According to the Iraqi Defense Ministry, Private First Class Thomas Tucker and Private First Class Kristian Menchaca were reportedly &quot;killed in a barbaric way,&quot; &quot;slaughtered,&quot; and tortured to death, and their bodies were so mutilated that DNA tests are being performed to help identify their remains. The alleged group has said it was a revenge for the rape and murder of an Iraqi girl who was dishonoured by soldiers of the same brigade.

Video of the killing of four Russian diplomats kidnapped in Iraq appear on the Internet. A group called the Mujahideen Shura Council released the hostage video.

===October 2009===
In 2009, an additional 21 color photographs surfaced, showing prisoners in Afghanistan and Iraq being abused by their U.S. captors.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said, &quot;[T]he government had long argued that the abuse at Abu Ghraib was isolated and was an aberration. The new photos would show that the abuse was more widespread.&quot; President Barack Obama initially indicated he would not fight the release of the photographs, but &quot;reversed course in May and authorized an appeal to the high court.&quot; &quot;The Obama administration believe[d] giving the imminent grant of authority over the release of such pictures to the defense secretary would short-circuit a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union under the Freedom of Information Act.&quot; On Oct 10, 2009 the US &quot;Congress [was] set to allow the Pentagon to keep new pictures ... from the public&quot;

===2010===
On February 3, 2010, David A. Larson, an elected official in California who has a relationship with government contract personnel, made disclosures to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Office of the Inspector General (OIG) alleging that under the Bush Administration, prisoners detained at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, and undisclosed &quot;black sites&quot; were being used as involuntary research subjects for human biomedical experimentation, behavior modification research, and drug-testosterone delivery in a manner similar to past CIA Project MKULTRA activities investigated in 1977 by Senators Kennedy and Inuoye. The allegation supports information contained in an International Red Cross report relative to the expanded role of CIA medical personnel in torture and interrogation.

In 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An Associated Press article said 
In September 2010 Amnesty International warned in a report titled &quot;New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq&quot; that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the US detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime, in which human rights abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the security forces. Amnesty&#x27;s Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say that &quot;Iraq&#x27;s security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees&#x27; rights and they have been permitted. US authorities, whose own record on detainees&#x27; rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by US forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights.&quot;

On October 22, 2010 nearly 400,000 secret United States army field reports and war logs, detailing torture, summary executions and war crimes, were passed on to the British paper, the Guardian and several other international media organisations through the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. Among others, the logs detail how US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished and that US troops abused prisoners for years even after the Abu Ghraib scandal. Both the UK and the US have condemned the unauthorised release of classified material, but did not question its accuracy.

In July 2019, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor and the Iraqi Centre for the Documentation of War Crimes released a joint statement in which they revealed testimonies from the Taji Prison in the north of Bagdad. The testimonies documented the Iraqi security forces&#x27; policies of humiliation and persecution against detainees in Iraqi prisons, where they are kept in a large camp, suffering harsh conditions, beaten, exploited, and deprived of their basic human rights.

===Investigations===
Several sets of investigations, both congressional via the Senate Armed Services Committee, military via courts-martial, and criminal for non-military contractors, were launched in response to the scandal.

Seymour Hersh, who exposed the Abu Ghraib scandal, and reports in Newsweek, has taken the case even further. In 2003, Donald Rumsfeld instituted a policy that &quot;encouraged physical coercion and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners in an effort to generate more intelligence about the growing insurgency in Iraq.&quot;. This policy stemmed from an earlier policy taken toward al-Qaeda prisoners. A memo to the Bush White House from counsel Alberto Gonzales claimed that the new sort of war renders the Geneva Conventions&#x27; limitations on interrogating enemy prisoners &quot;obsolete&quot;. The program was approved by the CIA, NSA, and the National Security Council. President George W. Bush was informed of it. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Steven Cambone administered the operation. His deputy, William Boykin, instructed the head of operations at Camp X-ray Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller to do the same at Abu Ghraib. Miller told Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski that the prison would now be dedicated to gathering intelligence. Douglas Feith and William Haynes were also involved in the operation.

On May 18, 2004, a military intelligence analyst named Samuel Provance came out to the press, stating &quot;There&#x27;s definitely a cover-up&quot;. Provance, who ran a computer network used by military intelligence in the prison and who had been ordered not to speak to the press, told ABC News &quot;Anything [the MPs] were to do legally or otherwise, they were to take those commands from the interrogators,&quot; and that the sexual humiliation began as a technique ordered by the investigators. He described several of the goings-on in the prison that he witnessed, such as the punching people in the neck hard enough to knock them unconscious after assuring them they weren&#x27;t going to be hit, in order to catch them off guard. He also stated that Maj. Gen. George Fay, the Army&#x27;s deputy chief of staff for intelligence, has shown little interest in investigating the interrogators and has gone only after the MPs, and that there is a culture of silence right now among those involved, who fear that if they say anything, the investigations will turn to them.

On May 19, 2004, a court martial hearing was held for Cpl. Charles A. Graner Jr., who has been accused of being the ringleader of the group employing torture at Abu Ghraib. In an unexpected move, all three key witnesses - Lt. Col. Steven L. Jordan, Capt. Donald J. Reese, and contractor Adel L. Nakhla - refused to testify. This is an almost unheard of action. Under court martial proceedings, one cannot refuse to testify unless they have a belief that they will be exposed to criminal charges for doing so. Consequently, it is likely that the investigative proceedings will be forced to move higher up the chain of command.

<text>The Portuguese Water Dog originated from the Algarve region of Portugal. From there the breed expanded to all around Portugal&#x27;s coast, where they were taught to herd fish into fishermen&#x27;s nets, retrieve lost tackle or broken nets, and act as couriers from ship to ship, or ship to shore.
Portuguese Water Dogs rode in fishing trawlers as they worked their way from the Atlantic waters of Portugal to the waters off the coast of Iceland fishing for cod.

In Portuguese, the breed is called  (; literally &#x27;dog of water&#x27;). In Portugal, the dog is also known as the Algarvian Water Dog (), or Portuguese Fishing Dog (). is the name given to the wavy-haired variety, and is the name for the curly-coated variety.

The Portuguese Water Dog is a fairly rare breed; only 36 Portuguese Water Dogs were entered for Britain&#x27;s Crufts competition in 2013. Though some breeders claim they are a hypoallergenic dog breed, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that hypoallergenic dog breeds exist. Their non-shedding qualities have made them more popular in recent years.
The Portuguese Water Dog was the chosen breed of US President Barack Obama, who had two of them, Bo and Sunny. The Obama family chose Sunny for the breed&#x27;s comparatively hypoallergenic nature, while Bo was given to them by Senator Ted Kennedy.

==Description==

Portuguese and Spanish water dogs are clearly related and probably have a common ancestor. The closest relatives of the PWD and Spanish Water dog are widely thought to be the Standard Poodle. Like Poodles and several other water dog breeds, PWDs are intelligent, can have curly coats, have webbed toes for swimming, and do not shed. However, Portuguese Water Dogs are more robustly built, with stout legs, and can have a wavy coat instead of tightly curled. If comparing the structure to that of a Poodle, there are significant differences between the two breeds. The Portuguese Water Dog is built of strong substantial bone; well developed, neither refined nor coarse, and a solidly built, muscular body. The Portuguese Water Dog is off-square, slightly longer than tall when measured from prosternum to rearmost point of the buttocks, and from withers to ground. Portuguese Water Dog eyes are black or various tones of brown, and their coats can be black, brown, black and white or brown and white.

Male Portuguese Water Dogs usually grow to be about tall, and they weigh between , while the females usually grow to be about tall, and they weigh between .

=== Coat types ===
PWDs have a single-layered coat that does not shed (see Moult), and therefore their presence is tolerated well among many people who suffer from dog allergies.

Most PWDs, especially those shown in conformation shows, are entirely black, black and white, brown, or silver-tipped; it is common to see white chest spots and white paws or legs on black or brown coated dogs. &quot;Parti&quot; or &quot;Irish-. &quot;Parti&quot; dogs are becoming more common in the United States. However, in Portugal, the breed standard does not allow more than 30% white markings. Overall, white is the least common Portuguese Water Dog color, while black with white markings on the chin (&quot;milk chin&quot;) and the chest is the most common color.

From the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America Revised Standard for the Portuguese Water Dog come these descriptions of the two coat types:

* Curly coat: &quot;Compact, cylindrical curls, somewhat lusterless. The hair on the ears is sometimes wavy.&quot;
* Wavy coat: &quot;Falling gently in waves, not curls, and with a slight sheen.&quot;

Many dogs have mixed pattern hair: curly all over the body but wavy on the tail and ears.

===Grooming styles===
If left untended, the hair on a PWD will keep growing indefinitely. Problems associated with this include the hair around the eyes growing so long as to impede vision, and matting of the body hair, which can cause skin irritations. For these reasons, PWDs must be trimmed about every two months and the coat brushed every other day.

The coat is usually worn in a &quot;retriever cut&quot; or a &quot;lion cut&quot;.

====The lion cut====
In the lion cut, the hindquarters, muzzle, and the base of the tail are shaved, with approximately 1/3 of the tail hair left long, also known as a flag, and the rest of the body is left full length. This traditional cut originated with the fishing dogs of Portugal. The lion cut diminished the initial shock of cold water when jumping from boats, as well as providing warmth to the vitals. The hindquarters were left shaved to allow easier movement of the back legs and the powerful, rudder-like tail.

====The retriever cut====
The retriever cut is one inch (2.5 cm) long, evenly over the body (although some owners prefer the muzzle or the base of the tail shorter, again, with approximately 1/3 of the tail hair left long, also known as a flag,). This cut is a more recent style and originated because breeders wanted to make the breed more appealing to buyers. Sometimes owners will clip the hair of their dogs very short, especially in the summer months, in modified retriever cut.

===Vocalisation===
Portuguese Water Dogs have a multi-octave voice. They tend to be quiet dogs although they will warn when the home is approached, and they will communicate their desires vocally and behaviorally to their owner. Their bark is loud and distinctive. They may engage in &quot;expressive panting&quot;, by making a distinct &quot;ha-ha-ha-ha&quot; sound as an invitation to play or to indicate a desire for nearby food. They sometimes whine.

The PWD&#x27;s biddability, high intelligence, and tendency to vocalise and then seek out its human master when specific alarms occur make it an ideal hearing-ear or deaf-assistance dog. PWDs can be readily trained to bark loudly when a telephone rings, and then to find and alert a hard-of-hearing or deaf master.

===Temperament===
Portuguese Water dogs are loving, independent, and intelligent and are easily trained in obedience and agility skills. They are generally friendly to strangers and enjoy being petted.

Because they are working dogs, PWDs are generally content in being at their master&#x27;s side, awaiting directions, and, if they are trained, they are willing and able to follow complex commands. They learn very quickly, seem to enjoy the training, and have a long memory for the names of objects. These traits and their non-shedding coats mean they excel at the various service dog roles such as hearing dogs (assistance dogs for the deaf), mobility dogs, and seizure response dogs. They also make unusually good therapy dogs.

A PWD usually stays in proximity to its owners, both indoors and outdoors. Although very gregarious animals, these dogs will typically bond with one primary family member. Some speculate that this intense bonding arose in the breed because the dogs were selected to work in proximity to their masters on small fishing boats, unlike other working dogs such as herding dogs and water dogs that range out to perform tasks. In any case, the modern PWD, whether employed on a boat or kept as a pet or a working dog, loves water and attention and prefers to be engaged in activity within sight of a human partner. This is not a breed to be left alone for long periods of time, indoors or out.

As water dogs, the PWD&#x27;s retrieving instinct is strong, which also gives some dogs tugging and chewing tendencies. A PWD will commonly jump as a greeting. Owners may choose to limit this behavior. Some PWDs may walk, hop, or &quot;dance&quot; on their hind legs when greeting or when excited. Some PWDs will stand upright at kitchen counters and tables, especially if they smell food above them. This habit is known as &quot;counter surfing&quot; and is characteristic of the breed.

Because of their intelligence and working drive, they require regular intensive exercise as well as mental challenges. They are gentle and patient—but not &quot;couch potatoes&quot;, and boredom can cause them to become destructive.

==History==

===In ancient times===
The Portuguese Water Dog and the Poodle appear to have developed from the same ancient genetic pool: At one time the Poodle was a longer-coated dog, as is one variety of the Portuguese Water Dog. PWD breeders say that the current-day Poodle, Kerry Blue Terrier, and Irish Water Spaniel are possible ancestors of the &quot;water dog&quot;.

===Modern history===
The PWD was a breed on the verge of extinction when, during the 1930s, Vasco Bensaude, a wealthy Portuguese shipping magnate, began to seek out fishermen&#x27;s dogs for use in a breeding program to re-establish the breed. Bensaude&#x27;s kennel was named Algarbiorum, and his most famous dog was Leão (1931–1942), a very &quot;type-y&quot; (that is, standard-conformant) fisherman&#x27;s stud dog, who was bred to so many different females that about half of the pedigreed Portuguese Water Dogs in existence can trace their lineage back to him. Bensaude was aided by two Portuguese veterinarians, Frederico Pinto Soares and Manuel Fernandes Marques. His work was carried on by Conchita Cintron de Castelo Branco, to whom he gave his last 14 PWDs and all his archives.

António Cabral was the founder of the Alvalade kennels in Portugal. Ch. Charlie de Alvalade (Charlie), a brown-coated dog, and C. B. Baluarte de Alvalade (Balu) were two of his many famous PWDs. He registered his first PWD in 1954 after Bensaude had pioneered the re-establishment of the breed in Portugal. Cabral worked with Carla Molinari, Deyanne Miller, Sonja Santos and others to establish PWDs in the US. The &quot;Mark of Cabral&quot; is a triangular shape of different color/textured hair, usually from the base of the tail.

Deyanne Miller is the person most responsible for the rise of the PWD in America. In 1972, the Millers, along with 14 others, formed the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America, Inc. (PWDCA). She worked with dogs from both the Cintron and Cabral lineages to establish a stable genetic pool of PWDs in the US at her Farmion kennels. Another early US breeder of PWDs was the actor Raymond Burr.

==Genetic diseases==
As with all purebred dogs, PWDs are vulnerable to certain genetic defects. Owing to the limited gene pool for this breed, conscientious breeders carefully study pedigrees and select dogs to minimize the chance of genetic disease and improper coat. As with many other breeds, growing popularity has encouraged breeding by people not knowledgeable about the breed.

===Hip dysplasia===
Like poodles, PWDs are vulnerable to hip dysplasia, a congenital and developmental problem with the hip joints. However, the risk of a PWD developing hip dysplasia can be greatly reduced by thoroughly checking the pedigrees and health clearances in both the sire and dam of the dog.

===Cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy, and distichiasis===
Cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy are two eye diseases found in PWDs. Progressive retinal atrophy, which causes &quot;night blindness&quot;, may lead to complete blindness. This is a simple recessive gene. DNA testing, known as &quot;Optigen Testing&quot;, can identify dogs carrying the gene for progressive retinal atrophy. &quot;Normal&quot; or &quot;A&quot; dogs do not carry the gene. &quot;Carriers&quot; or &quot;B&quot; dogs carry one copy of the gene and will &quot;not&quot; express the disease, but pass the gene to 50% of their offspring. &quot;Affected&quot; or &quot;C&quot; dogs have two copies of the progressive retinal atrophy gene and will probably express the disease as late onset progressive retinal atrophy. &quot;B&quot; or &quot;C&quot; dogs should be bred &quot;only&quot; to &quot;A&quot; dogs to ensure that any offspring will not express the disease.

Ingrown eyelashes (distichiasis) occur in some curly-coated breeds, but they are not particularly common in PWDs. Ingrown eyelashes will rub the eye, causing extensive corneal ulcerations. The condition is minor so long as it is not ignored, and can be surgically treated if necessary.

===GM1 storage disease===
GM1 storage disease, one of a family of conditions called GM1 gangliosidoses, is a recessive, genetic disorder that is inevitably fatal. It is caused by a deficiency of beta-galactosidase, with resulting abnormal storage of acidic lipid materials in cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems, but particularly in the nerve cells. Because PWDs are all rather closely related to one another and share a limited gene pool, PWDs who were GM1 storage disease carriers were able to be genetically identified, and the condition has now been almost entirely eliminated from the breed. All breeding stock should be tested for GM-1 storage disease or GM1 gangliosidoses, which is a fatal nerve disease that typically appears when a puppy is approximately six months of age. The affected puppy will show clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction including ataxia, tremors, paresis, and seizures. The pet may also exhibit a change in temperament. Lesions of the retina and clouding of the cornea may occur.

===Juvenile dilated cardiomyopathy===
Juvenile dilated cardiomyopathy is a fatal condition caused by an autosomal recessive gene. Affected puppies die suddenly or with very little warning usually between the ages of six weeks to seven months old. The signs and symptoms include a 12- to 48-hour onset of loss of appetite, decreased energy level, vomiting, and difficulty breathing. Some pups have no physical signs or symptoms at all, may just collapse and die, or are found dead by the breeder or new owner. At this time, there is no known cure or treatment but there is a way to prevent producing puppies affected by juvenile dilated cardiomyopathy.

Breeders now have a DNA gene-based test, based on a cheek swab or a blood sample, which will determine if a dog is a carrier of the gene for juvenile dilated cardiomyopathy. All breeding animals can be tested to determine their status, thus avoiding the breeding of two carriers. A puppy from a sire or dam without the gene will not be affected with this fatal disease.
