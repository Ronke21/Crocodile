<text>The Galloway is a Scottish breed of beef cattle, named after the Galloway region of Scotland, where it originated during the seventeenth century.

It is usually black, is of average size, is naturally polled and has a thick coat suitable for the harsh climate of Scotland. It is reared mainly for beef.

In 2022 the Galloway was reported by twenty-three countries. The worldwide population stood at about head, of which the majority were in Northern Europe, with the largest populations in Denmark and Germany.

== Etymology ==

The word &#x27;Galloway&#x27; derives from the name of a people, the , meaning &#x27;Scandinavian Gaels&#x27;.

== History ==

Polled black cattle were known in Scotland by the sixteenth century at the latest; one is mentioned in an instrument of sasine dated 1523.

The Galloway breed comes from the cattle native to the south-west region of Scotland, first fully developed in the seventeenth century. Originally, there was much variation within this breed, including many different colours and patterns. The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle, but the recessive gene for red colour persisted in the population, and eventually dun Galloways were also allowed into the herd book. As a result, although black is still the most common colour for Galloways, they can also be red and several shades of dun. In 1877, the Galloway Cattle Society was formed.

The Galloway was introduced in Canada in 1853, first registered in 1872, and the first Galloway registry was introduced in the United States in 1882. In 1911, cattle were registered in the American Galloway Herd Book which was first created in 1882. The British Galloway Society was founded in 1908. They did not recognise dun coloured Galloway cattle, which was met with outrage and this ban was later lifted. In 1951, Galloway cattle were introduced to Australia.

In the 1950s, the breed enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input (feed) cattle with high quality meat. However, the BSE crisis (or mad cow disease) caused an export ban in 1990, although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle. This created a fear associated with cattle, so breed numbers declined.

Since then, there has been a change in demand as bigger leaner carcasses are now favoured. Some of the adjustments made were the adoption of AI and Embryo Transfer. The breed&#x27;s original characteristics are now back in demand. This is due to the demand of high quality meat that requires economical production.

From the early nineteenth century, in south-western Scotland and north-western England, Galloway cows were commonly put to Shorthorn bulls to produce a vigorous hybrid. If the bull was white, the calf was blue roan in colour – the Blue Grey. These were easily recognisable and were much in demand. In the later nineteenth century, selection of the Whitebred Shorthorn was begun specifically for production of white sires for these calves.

In 2022 the Galloway was reported to DAD-IS by twenty-three countries, of which seventeen reported population data. The reported worldwide population stood at about head, of which the majority were in Northern Europe; the largest populations were in Denmark and Germany. The breed is &#x27;rare&#x27; in the United States and the Livestock Conservancy classifies it as a breed to &#x27;watch&#x27;.

== Characteristics ==

Galloway cows are of small to medium size, with weights in the range ; bulls normally weigh approximately , but may reach weights of over . Heifer calves are born at a weight of some , and reach a weight of about at an age of thirteen or fourteen months.

Galloways have a thick double-layered coat that is wavy or curly. The coat of hair insulates their bodies so well that they have a minimal outer layer of fat on their bodies, which would otherwise create waste at slaughter. This coat sheds out in the summer months and in warmer climates.

It is naturally polled, without horns. This breed&#x27;s shaggy coat has both a thick, woolly undercoat for warmth and stiffer guard hairs that help shed water, making them well adapted to harsher climates.

== Use ==

There is evidence of Galloway herds being milked in Cumberland for cheese production.

<doc id="646067" wikidata="Q579886" url="?curid=646067" title="Submandibular gland">
<text>The paired submandibular glands (historically known as submaxillary glands) are major salivary glands located beneath the floor of the mouth. In adult humans, they each weigh about 15 grams and contribute some 60–67% of unstimulated saliva secretion; on stimulation their contribution decreases in proportion as parotid gland secretion rises to 50%. The average length of the normal adult human submandibular salivary gland is approximately 27 mm, while the average width is approximately 14.3 mm.

==Structure==
Each submandibular gland is divided into a superficial lobe and a deep lobe, the two being separated by the mylohyoid muscle:
* The superficial lobe comprises most of the gland, with the mylohyoid muscle runs under it
* The deep lobe is the smaller part

=== Submandibular duct ===
Secretions are delivered into the submandibular duct on the deep portion after which they hook around the posterior edge of the mylohyoid muscle and proceed on the superior surface laterally. The excretory ducts are then crossed by the lingual nerve, and ultimately drain into the sublingual caruncles – small prominences on either side of the lingual frenulum along with the major sublingual duct. The gland can be bilaterally palpated (felt) inferior and posterior to the body of the mandible, moving inward from the inferior border of the mandible near its angle with the head tilted forwards.

===Submandibular gland papilla===
The terminal part of the submandibular (Wharton&#x27;s) duct is located in the mouth floor and opens as an orifice of the submandibular duct papilla. The position of the duct and its 0.5–1.5 mm wide ostium is invariably symmetric, but quite unpredictable; consequently, submandibular duct papillae can occasionally be challenging to recognize. Based on the macroscopic appearance of the papillae and a sialoendoscopic approach, Anicin et al. described four different types of submandibular gland papillae: types A, B, C, and D.

===Microanatomy===

Lobes contain smaller lobules, which contain adenomeres, the secretory units of the gland. Each adenomere contains one or more acini, or alveoli, which are small clusters of cells that secrete their products into a duct. The acini of each adenomere are composed of either serous or mucous cells, with serous adenomeres predominating. Some mucous adenomeres may also be capped with a serous demilune, a layer of lysozyme-secreting serous cells resembling a half moon.

Like other exocrine glands, the submandibular gland can be classified by the microscopic anatomy of its secretory cells and how they are arranged. Because the glands are branched, and because the tubules forming the branches contain secretory cells, submandibular glands are classified as branched tubuloacinar glands. Further, because the secretory cells are of both serous and mucous types, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and though most of the cells are serous, the exudate is chiefly mucous. It has long striated ducts and short intercalated ducts.

The secretory acinar cells of the submandibular gland have distinct functions. The mucous cells are the most active and therefore the major product of the submandibular glands is saliva which is mucoid in nature. Mucous cells secrete mucin which aids in the lubrication of the food bolus as it travels through the esophagus. In addition, the serous cells produce salivary amylase, which aids in the breakdown of starches in the mouth. The submandibular gland&#x27;s highly active acini account for most of the salivary volume. The parotid and sublingual glands account for the remaining.

===Blood supply===
The gland receives its blood supply from the facial and lingual arteries. The gland is supplied by sublingual and submental arteries and drained by common facial and lingual veins.

===Lymphatic drainage===

The lymphatics from submandibular gland first drain into submandibular lymph nodes and subsequently into jugulo - digastric lymph nodes.

===Nerve supply===

Their secretions, like the secretions of other salivary glands, are regulated &quot;directly&quot; by the parasympathetic nervous system and &quot;indirectly&quot; by the sympathetic nervous system.
* &quot;Parasympathetic&quot; innervation to the submandibular glands is provided by the superior salivatory nucleus via the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve, that becomes part of the trigeminal nerve&#x27;s lingual nerve prior to synapsing on the submandibular ganglion. Increased parasympathetic activity promotes the secretion of saliva.
* The sympathetic nervous system regulates submandibular secretions through vasoconstriction of the arteries that supply it. Increased sympathetic activity reduces glandular bloodflow, thereby decreasing the volume of fluid in salivary secretions, producing an enzyme rich mucous saliva. Nevertheless, direct stimulation of sympathetic nerves will cause an increase in salivary enzymatic secretions. In sum, the volume decreases, but the secretions are increased by parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation.

=== Relations ===
The submandibular gland occurs within the submandibular triangle. It is situated posteroinferior to the ramus of mandible, and between the two bellies of the digastric muscle.

===Development===
The submandibular salivary glands develop later than the parotid glands and appear late in the sixth week of prenatal development. They develop bilaterally from epithelial buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor of the primitive mouth. Solid cords branch from the buds and grow posteriorly, lateral to the developing tongue. The cords of the submandibular gland later branch further and then become canalized to form the ductal part. The submandibular gland acini develop from the cords’ rounded terminal ends at 12 weeks, and secretory activity via the submandibular duct begins at 16 weeks. Growth of the submandibular gland continues after birth with the formation of more acini. Lateral to both sides of the tongue, a linear groove develops and closes over to form the submandibular duct.

==Function==
The submandibular gland is one of the major three glands that provide the mouth with saliva. The
two other types of salivary glands are parotid and sublingual glands.

The submandibular gland releases a host of factors which regulate systemic inflammatory responses and modulate systemic immune and inflammatory reactions. Early work in identifying factors that played a role in the cervical sympathetic trunk-submandibular gland (CST-SMG) axis lead to the discovery of a seven amino acid peptide, called the submandibular gland peptide-T. SGP-T was demonstrated to have biological activity and thermoregulatory properties related to endotoxin exposure. SGP-T, an isolate of the submandibular gland, demonstrated its immunoregulatory properties and potential role in modulating the CST-SMG axis, and subsequently was shown to play an important role in the control of inflammation.

==Clinical significance==
The submandibular gland accounts for 80% of all salivary duct calculi (salivary stones or sialolith), possibly due to the different nature of the saliva that it produces and the tortuous travel of the submandibular duct to its ductal opening for a considerable upward distance.

Benign and malignant tumors can also develop in the submandibular gland (see pie chart).

<text>Walter Bishop Sr. (January 9, 1905 – January 8, 1984) was a Jamaican-American drummer, composer and songwriter. Bishop was born in Jamaica, but emigrated to the United States prior to beginning his professional career. He and his family lived in the Sugar Hill district of the Harlem neighborhood of Upper Manhattan.

Bishop played drums on recordings by pianist Alex Hill and trumpeter Jabbo Smith during the 1920s and 1930s. His song &quot;Swing, Brother, Swing&quot; was recorded by Billie Holiday with Count Basie, among other performers. Other songs written by Bishop include &quot;Jack, You&#x27;re Dead,&quot; which was a #1 R&amp;B hit in 1947 as recorded by Louis Jordan, &quot;The Stuff is Here (and It&#x27;s Mellow),&quot; and &quot;Bop! Goes My Heart,&quot; which was recorded by Frank Sinatra. His song &quot;My Baby Likes to Bebop&quot; was recorded by Ella Fitzgerald, and by Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole with Johnny Mercer, and his calypso &quot;Sex is a Misdemeanor&quot; was recorded by Vanessa Rubin. 

He was the father of American jazz pianist Walter Bishop Jr.

<doc id="646085" wikidata="Q313858" url="?curid=646085" title="Arado Ar 232 Tausendfüßler">
<text>The Arado Ar 232 &quot;Tausendfüßler&quot; (German: &quot;Millipede&quot;), sometimes also called &quot;Tatzelwurm&quot;, was a cargo aircraft that was designed and produced in small numbers by the German aircraft manufacturer Arado Flugzeugwerke. It was designed during the first half of the Second World War in response to a request by the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (German Air Ministry, RLM) for a successor or supplemental transport aircraft to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s obsolescent Junkers Ju 52/3m. The Ar 232 introduced, or brought together, almost all of the features now considered to be standard in modern cargo transport aircraft designs, including a box-like fuselage slung beneath a high wing; a rear loading ramp (that had first appeared on the December 1939-flown Junkers Ju 90 V5 fifth prototype four-engined transport via its &quot;Trapoklappe&quot;), a high-mounted twin tail for easy access to the hold and features for operating from rough fields. It was initially requested to be powered by a pair of BMW 801A/B radial engines, however, an alternative arrangement of four BMW Bramo 323 engines was adopted instead due to a lack of capacity.

The first twin-engine prototype performing its maiden flight in June 1941, while the first four-engine prototype followed roughly one year later. The type demonstrated clear performance advantages over the Ju 52/3m and limited pre-production orders were placed, leading to roughly 20 aircraft being constructed. The envisioned mass production of the Ar 232 was never attained, primarily due to Germany having an abundance of transport aircraft in production and thus it did not purchase large numbers of Ar 232s. Several aircraft did see operational use, to aid wartime production efforts and on the front line. Arado&#x27;s design team continued to work on refinements, including economy measures and the enlarged six-engined Ar 632 variant. At one point, German officials expected quantity production of the type to be attained in October 1945 but the war ended instead. Two Ar 232s were captured by the British and operated for a time between England and Germany following the conflict.

==Development==
As with many German aircraft, the availability of suitable engines seriously impacted development and production.

===2-engined Ar 232A===
What would become the Ar 232 originated from a tender offered by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM/German Aviation Ministry) issued during late 1939 which sought a replacement for the ubiquitous Ju 52/3m transport. Both Arado and Henschel were requested to design a rear-loading aircraft that was to be powered by a pair of 1,193 kW (1,600 hp) BMW 801A/B radial engines, which was just entering prototype production and not currently used on any front-line designs. Arado&#x27;s design team was headed by the aeronatical engineer Wilhelm van Nes. The basic configuration selected was that of a cantilever mid-wing smooth-skinned monocoque design with a spacious cargo area that was as low to the ground as feasibly possible. Furthermore, the aircraft was to be relatively robust and capable of operating from austere airstrips and rough terrain, possess short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities, and permit rapid loading and unloading times.

===Engine discussion — parallel development===

Following a review of the competing aircraft, Arado&#x27;s design was selected over Henschel&#x27;s, leading to the company receiving an initial order for three prototypes in 1940. However, challenges for the Ar 232 soon became apparent in the form of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 project, which had been also earmarked to use the same BMW 801A/B engine. However, production of the BMW 801 was deemed to be insufficient to fulfil all of the prospective demands, thus Arado was compelled to adopt an alternative engine for the Ar 232. Eventually, the BMW Bramo 323 &quot;Fafnir&quot; nine-cylinder radial engine, weighing roughly 550 kg (1,210 lbs) each, from Focke-Wulf&#x27;s Fw 200 land-based maritime patrol aircraft was selected as the alternate powerplant instead. The Bramo 323 was already in production and could meet requirements if the Ar 232 really did replace the Ju 52/3m in service. The prototypes were far enough along that switching engines would have seriously delayed the program, thus the first two aircraft were to be completed as the Ar 232A, while the third and a newly ordered fourth prototype were designated as the Ar 232B. The third and fourth prototypes (and all production aircraft) used four engines (in place of the two specified in the RLM specification) in order to provide the desired performance.

The first two prototypes, bearing the &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; alphabetic codes GH+GN and VD+YB respectively, were completed in early 1941 and commenced trials as soon as possible. The first flight, while otherwise uneventful, suffered a partial landing gear failure during landing; while the nose gear collapsed, the twenty-two &quot;millipede wheels&quot; saved the aircraft from damage. The cause was determined to be a stuck oleo strut, which was too short when fully extended, and thus easily rectified via the insertion of a ring.

The general performance of the Ar 232 proved to outperform the Ju 52/3m in multiple respects; it carried roughly double the load over longer distances, operated from shorter runways and rougher fields if need be, and cruised about 70 km/h (44 mph) faster. A further ten pre-production aircraft were constructed; these saw operational used as the Ar 232A-0 while awaiting production versions.

===4-engined Ar 232B===

The Ar 232B program proceeded in parallel to this effort. With the quartet of 895 kW (1,200 hp) Bramo 323s replacing the twin BMW 801s, each Bramo 323 with its aforementioned 550 kg dry weight apiece; power increased from 2,386 kW (3,200 hp) to 3,580 kW (4,800 hp), solving the Ar 232A&#x27;s problem of having little excess power in case of engine failure. This change also required the wing to be extended slightly, the span increasing just over 3 m (9 ft 10 in) in total. The extra weight of the Bramo 323 engines also moved the center of gravity forward, which was offset by stretching the cargo area rearward another meter, expanding the cargo capacity it could carry internally.

During May 1942, the first of the two four-engined prototypes, V3, performed its maiden flight. A further 10 aircraft were then ordered as the Ar 232B-0, and were used widely in an operational role. However, this was the only order for the design, as the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; gave transport aircraft production a relatively low priority. Many of those aircraft produced were used by Arado to transport aircraft parts between its factories, and did not see front-line service.

===Ar 432===

Various improvements to the Ar 232 were planned, such as the replacement of the outer wing sections and control surfaces with wooden versions to conserve aluminium. Originally to be known as the Ar 232C, the design effort was protracted and was later redesignated the Ar 432. During June 1944, plans were finally put into place to start production in October 1945, but the conflict came to an end without even a prototype being produced. Two even larger planned versions, the Ar 532 and the Ar 632, would have almost doubled the wingspan to 60 m (196 ft 10 in), as large as Germany&#x27;s six-engined BV 238 flying boat design, and added another two engines. An amphibian transport, the Ar 430, was also projected for use in the Mediterranean.

==Design==
The Ar 232 was a multi-engined transport aircraft. It was normally operated by a crew of four, of which the pilot was the only member without two roles. The navigator also operated a 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine gun in the nose, while the radio operator could also used a 20 mm MG 151 cannon in a rotating turret on the roof, and the loadmaster was provisioned with a 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine gun that fired rearward from the extreme rear of the cargo bay above the cargo doors.The aircraft could be outfitted with various auxiliary kits to suit certain operational circumstances, such as winter/tropical kits, a radio set, a rubber liferaft, an oil-burning heater, and a emergency power unit.

The cargo bay of the Ar 232, which was directly behind the aircraft&#x27;s &quot;stepless cockpit&quot;, was 6.6 m (21 ft 7¾ in) long, 2.3 m (7 ft 6½ in) wide and 2.0 m (6 ft 6¾ in) high. Unlike typical designs of the era that used a side-mounted door for access, the Ar 232 was furnished with hydraulically powered clamshell-doors on the rear of the bay with a ramp, which permitted cargo to be rolled into the hold. The twin tail configuration tail surfaces were mounted on the end of a long boom to keep the area behind the doors clear so trucks could drive right up to the ramp, much like the 1944-era American Fairchild C-82 Packet of a differing twin boom fuselage configuration. The high-set tail on its &quot;pod-and-boom&quot; configuration fuselage allowed the Ar 232 to be loaded and unloaded faster than other designs. An overhead crane was installed within the cargo bay to assist this process.

The Ar 232 was furnished with a three-piece twin-spar wing, comprising all-through rectangular centrepiece that was attached to a pair of trapezoidal outer wings, each accommodating self-sealing fuel tanks and the main landing gear. The entire rear surface of the wing incorporated Arado&#x27;s own &quot;travelling flap&quot; design to achieve excellent short-field performance; these flaps were electronically actuated and interconnected with the ailerons. Further measures to reduce the landing distance included a drogue parachute and rockets. Even when loaded to 16,000 kg (35,270 lb), the Ar 232 could take off in 200 m (656 ft); this was in part achieved via a boundary layer control system. The take-off distance could be further reduced via the use of &quot;Starthilfe&quot; liquid fuelled monopropellant rocket assist (RATO) jettisonable propulsion units.

Perhaps the most noticeable feature of the Ar 232 was the landing gear. Normal operations from prepared runways used a tricycle gear — a then-novel feature for German military aircraft—but the sideways-retracting main gear&#x27;s lever-action lower oleo strut suspended arm – carrying the main gear&#x27;s wheel/tire unit at the bottoms of the maingears&#x27; struts could &quot;break&quot;, or kneel, after landing to place the fuselage closer to the ground and thereby reduce the ramp angle. An additional set of eleven smaller, non-retractable twinned wheels per side, mounted along the ventral centreline of the fuselage from just behind the semi-retractable nosewheel aftwards to just forward of the wing&#x27;s trailing edge, supported the aircraft once the main landing gear&#x27;s lever-action lower arm had &quot;knelt&quot;, or could be used for additional support when landing on soft or rough airfields. The aircraft was intended to be capable of taxiing at low speeds on its row of small wheels, thus being able to negotiate small obstacles such as ditches up to 1.5 m (5 ft) in width. The appearance of the row of small wheels led to the nickname &quot;millipede&quot;. In flight, the main legs fully retracted inwards into the wings, while the fixed support wheels remained exposed and the nose wheel only semi-retracted, with the nosewheel tire&#x27;s lowest point while retracted never going above the lowest point of the 22 auxiliary centre-line wheels&#x27; tires.

==Operational history==
German officials intended for the aircraft to be used in a wide variety of circumstances, specific mentions including North Africa and the Arctic.

In late 1942, in response to the deteriorating situation of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s 6th Army during the Battle of Stalingrad, it was decided to deploy the first two Ar 232 prototypes to the Eastern Front for the purpose of delivering critical supplies and airlifting casualties 

The first prototype was promptly lost along with its entire crew after the pilot became disorientated. The second prototype was more successful, completing multiple missions in January 1943, typically flying in and out of Stalingrad unhindered. Its crew occasionally opted to avoid airfields when enemy forces were known to be waiting in ambush, instead landing on rough terrain, a feat that would have been impossible for most transport aircraft of its size at the time.

On 17 July 1943, a twin-engined Ar 232 flew from Brandenburg, Germany to Banak, Norway, the northernmost airport in Europe; the flight, which delivered automated weather apparatus, necessitated the fitting of auxiliary fuel tanks. One month later, the aircraft was lost with all onboard due to a single engine failure shortly after take off followed by a collision with terrain.

Outside of conventional military logistics, the Ar 232 found numerous uses; Arado made frequent use of the type to transport high priority aviation components.

At least five Ar 232s are believed to have been operated by Kampfgeschwader 200, a secretive special operations unit of the Luftwaffe. Multiple attempts using Ar 232s were made to infiltrate covert agents behind Soviet lines, including a mission under remit of the top secret Operation Zeppelin which intended to assassinate Joseph Stalin in late 1944.

Starting in December 1944, several Ar 232 were directed to fly supplies to a supposed pocket of German military personnel active behind Soviet lines. Despite such flights continuing for months, this effort was entirely fruitless as it was an NKVD deception operation, known as Operation Scherhorn.

Two Ar 232 B-0s were captured by British forces towards the end of the conflict. Multiple test flights of these aircraft were performed by Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown, who reportedly gave the aircraft an excellent report. Subsequently, they were operated for a time by the Royal Air Force on flights between England and Germany as late as 1946.

<doc id="646086" wikidata="Q3127949" url="?curid=646086" title="Harry E. Yarnell">
<text>Admiral Harry Ervin Yarnell (18 October 1875 – 7 July 1959) was an American naval officer whose career spanned over 51 years and three wars, from the Spanish–American War through World War II.

Among his achievements was proving, in 1932 war games, that Pearl Harbor was vulnerable to a naval aerial attack. His findings were dismissed by his superiors until the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s Pearl Harbor attack went just as Yarnell had predicted.

==Early life and Naval career==
Born near Independence, Iowa, he entered the U.S. Naval Academy in 1893. After serving on during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, 3 July 1898, Yarnell was commissioned ensign 1 July 1899 and reported to the Asiatic Station. He served in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War and with the Asiatic Squadron during the Boxer Rebellion. In 1902, he was the commissioning commanding officer of the destroyer .

==Assignments through World War I==
From Asia, Yarnell reported to at her commissioning. On January 13, 1907, he was the officer of the deck when &quot;Connecticut&quot; ran aground near Culebra, Puerto Rico. Both Yarnell and &quot;Connecticut&quot; captain William Swift were court-martialed; Swift was convicted but Yarnell was acquitted. Restored to duty, Yarnell sailed around the world with the Great White Fleet.

Next, duty at the Newport Torpedo Station, on CINCLANT&#x27;s staff, and at the Naval War College occupied him until World War I (WWI), when he served at Gibraltar and then at London, on the staff of Admiral William S. Sims.

At the conclusion of WWI, CAPT Yarnell was awarded the Navy Cross, for his &quot;distinguished services in the ... Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, and on the Staff of the Commander, U.S. Naval Forces operating in European waters&quot;.

==Interwar assignments==
Yarnell then rotated between sea and shore duty until ordered to the aircraft carrier in September 1927, as prospective commanding officer. He served as captain of the carrier from her commissioning until 17 August 1928, when he was appointed Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering as Rear Admiral. While in that capacity, advising the General Board on the design of a fleet submarine, Yarnell opposed smaller types, presciently noting, &quot;our prospective opponent [Japan] has always started operations by attacking before a declaration of war&quot;.

From January to April 1930, Admiral Yarnell was Naval Adviser to the American delegation at the London Naval Conference 1930, and, in October 1936, he became Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, with the rank of admiral. His tour there was notable for the sagacious and firm manner with which he handled a most explosive international situation.

In February 1932, Yarnell pioneered carrier tactics in an exercise called Army/Navy Grand Joint Exercise 4. Rear Admiral Yarnell commanded the carriers and &quot;Saratoga&quot; in an effort to demonstrate that Hawaii was vulnerable to naval air power. The expectation was that Yarnell would attack with battleships, but instead he left his battleships behind and proceeded only with his carriers to the north of Hawaii where it was less likely he would be detected. With a storm as cover, at dawn on Sunday, 7 February, Yarnell&#x27;s 152 planes attacked the harbor from the northeast, just as the Japanese would ten years later. The army airfields were first put out of commission after which Battleship Row was attacked, with multiple hits on navy ships. No defending aircraft were able to launch. The Navy&#x27;s war-game umpires declared the attack a total success, prompting Yarnell to strenuously warn of the Japanese threat.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on the exercise, noting the defenders were unable to find the attacking fleet even after 24 hours had passed. U.S. intelligence knew Japanese writers had reported on the exercise. Ironically, in the U.S., the battleship admirals voted down a reassessment of naval tactics. The umpire&#x27;s report did not even mention the stunning success of Yarnell&#x27;s exercise. Instead they wrote, &quot;It is doubtful if air attacks can be launched against Oahu in the face of strong defensive aviation without subjecting the attacking carriers to the danger of material damage and consequent great losses in the attack air force.&quot;

Yarnell&#x27;s carrier tactics were reprised by Ernest King (at the time, Vice-Admiral) in &quot;Saratoga&quot; during wargames held in winter of 1938, with the same results, both in terms of surprising the defenders and in terms of the tactics being dismissed as &quot;unfair&quot;.

==World War II==
After three years&#x27; service commanding the Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell was transferred to the Retired List, and was elected an honorary member of the Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the Revolution on February 22, 1940.

On 1 November 1941, as war loomed, Yarnell was recalled to active duty and worked in the office of the Secretary of the Navy as Special Adviser to the Chinese Military Mission. While in this capacity, he testified before House Immigration Committee urging repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Acts.

Yarnell was relieved of active duty 15 January 1943, but returned in June as Head of a Special Section in the Office of Chief of Naval Operations until December 1944, when he again was relieved of active duty.

==Death==
Admiral Harry E. Yarnell died on 7 July 1959 at Newport, Rhode Island, his home since his retirement. He is buried at Berkeley Memorial Cemetery in Middletown, Rhode Island together with his wife Emily Carroll Thomas Yarnell (1875–1965). They had one daughter, Ruth (1906–1948), who married late Vice admiral John Sylvester.They also had a son, Phillip, who married Vivian and settled down in the Baltimore area.

<text>Rosanna Diane Davison (born 17 April 1984) is an Irish actress, singer, writer, model and beauty queen who was crowned Miss World 2003. She is the daughter of musician Chris de Burgh, and the song &quot;For Rosanna&quot; was written by her father for his 1986 album, &quot;Into the Light&quot; in her honour. Davison is a qualified nutritional therapist and promotes the health benefits of a plant-based diet.

==Career==
In August 2003, she entered the Miss Ireland finals in Dublin, and winning the competition, found herself competing for the title of Miss World. December 2003 saw Davison, along with 106 other contestants, compete in the Miss World competition in Sanya, China. Rosanna went on to win the crown and is the first Irish entrant to win the Miss World title since it started in 1951. During Davison&#x27;s reign, she visited the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, China, and Sri Lanka.

In February 2012, she came second in a poll to find Ireland&#x27;s most desirable Valentines. In the same year, she appeared on the October German issue of Playboy magazine.

From October 2013, she started presenting slots on LFC TV, the dedicated television channel for Liverpool F.C. 

In December 2023, Davison was announced as one of the eleven celebrities taking part in the seventh season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars.&quot;

==Personal life==
Born in County Dublin, Ireland, Davison&#x27;s primary school education was at Aravon School, in County Wicklow. She then attended Rathdown School in Glenageary, County Dublin. She was class prefect before graduating and completing her leaving certificate examinations in 2002.

Davison has been in a relationship with Wesley Quirke since 2006. They were engaged in 2013 and wed in the summer of 2014. They had their honeymoon in the Seychelles. They have one daughter, and twin sons. 

Davison is a graduate of the College of Naturopathic Medicine. She is a qualified nutritional therapist and obtained her MSc degree in personalised nutrition from Middlesex University. In February 2015 she signed a publishing deal with Gill Books for her first cookbook, &quot;Eat Yourself Beautiful&quot;, which was released in August 2015 and went on to be a best-seller. The book advocates plant-based nutrition. 

Davison has previously collaborated with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals on multiple occasions to promote the benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets. In 2019, Davison was criticised by vegan activists for taking part in a paid campaign for Naas Racecourse. In response, Davison stated that although she eats a plant-based diet for both health and ethical reasons, she has never claimed to be a &quot;lifestyle vegan&quot;.

<text>Sparse grids are numerical techniques to represent, integrate or interpolate high dimensional functions. They were originally developed by the Russian mathematician Sergey A. Smolyak, a student of Lazar Lyusternik, and are based on a sparse tensor product construction. Computer algorithms for efficient implementations of such grids were later developed by Michael Griebel and Christoph Zenger.

== Curse of dimensionality ==
The standard way of representing multidimensional functions are tensor or full grids. The number of basis functions or nodes (grid points) that have to be stored and processed depend exponentially on the number of dimensions.

The curse of dimensionality is expressed in the order of the integration error that is made by a quadrature of level formula_1, with formula_2 points. The function has regularity formula_3, i.e. is formula_3 times differentiable. The number of dimensions is formula_5.

formula_6

== Smolyak&#x27;s quadrature rule ==
Smolyak found a computationally more efficient method of integrating multidimensional functions based on a univariate quadrature rule formula_7. The formula_5-dimensional Smolyak integral formula_9 of a function formula_10 can be written as a recursion formula with the tensor product.

formula_11

The index to formula_12 is the level of the discretization. If a 1-dimension integration on level formula_13 is computed by the evaluation of formula_14 points, the error estimate for a function of regularity formula_3 will be

<doc id="646091" wikidata="Q1742110" url="?curid=646091" title="Kingborough Council">
<text>Kingborough Council is a local government body in Tasmania, and one of the five municipalities that constitutes the Greater Hobart Area. Kingborough is classified as an urban local government area and has a population of 37,734, it covers the transition from the southern urban areas of Hobart through Kingston, as well as encompassing Bruny Island.

==Etymology==
The origin of Kingborough Council is a simple derivation from the name of the main town. The name Kingston was suggested by Mr Lucas in 1851, and the area had been known as Brown&#x27;s River before then. Why he suggested this name is unknown. Mr Lucas&#x27; parents had been raised in England near New Kingston, they had come from Norfolk Island where the capital was Kingston or it might have been named after the Governor of New Norfolk Philip Gidley King.

==History==
Europeans settled in the Kingborough Council&#x27;s district in 1808 at Brown&#x27;s River (Promenalinah), named after Robert Brown, botanist in 1804. The town and district were both known as Brown&#x27;s River during the earliest periods of settlement. The Lucas family settled the area and built The Red House, a prominent mansion which is now Kingston Golf Club. Early Kingston developed primarily around The Red House. Development of Kingborough was slow and the first post office opened only in the 1840s. The first road to Hobart, Proctors Road, was opened in 1835.

Kingston was proclaimed a town in 1851. The town&#x27;s name was suggested by the then Police Magistrate, a member of the Lucas family. By 1890 Kingston had a population of 249. When proclaimed on 20 August 1907, the Kingborough Municipality comprised 3 wards: Kingston, Margate and Longley. On 2 April 1993 Kingborough absorbed the former municipality of Bruny.

In 1877 Keen&#x27;s Curry was invented in the municipality.

The area developed as a holiday area, especially the suburbs of Kingston Beach and Blackmans Bay. Margate and Kettering operated fishing fleets and Taroona had a manufacturing industry, primarily through Taroona Shot Tower. Sandfly became a centre for small fruits and apple orcharding. The decline of the apple industry progressed during the 1960s, but the industry collapsed entirely following the 1967 Tasmanian fires, when much of the municipality was devastated and most orchards burnt down. A memorial to the 62 fatalities of the fire was constructed in Snug following the fire, where 80 of the towns 120 buildings burned and a permanent exhibition is present at the Channel Heritage Centre.

==Current composition==
==Demographics==
Localities and smaller towns of the region include Taroona, Kettering, Margate, Snug, Blackmans Bay and Woodbridge. Kingston is classified as urban, fringe and medium (UFM) under the Australian Classification of Local Governments.

<doc id="646092" wikidata="Q1140794" url="?curid=646092" title="Mitral stenosis">
<text>Mitral stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterized by the narrowing of the opening of the mitral valve of the heart. It is almost always caused by rheumatic valvular heart disease. Normally, the mitral valve is about 5 cm2 during diastole. Any decrease in area below 2 cm2 causes mitral stenosis. Early diagnosis of mitral stenosis in pregnancy is very important as the heart cannot tolerate increased cardiac output demand as in the case of exercise and pregnancy. Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of resulting left atrial enlargement, which can lead to systemic thromboembolic complications such as stroke.

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms of mitral stenosis include the following:
* Heart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND)
* Palpitations
* Chest pain
* Hemoptysis
* Thromboembolism in later stages when the left atrial volume is increased (i.e., dilation). The latter leads to increase risk of atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of blood stasis (motionless). This increases the risk of coagulation.
* Ascites and edema and hepatomegaly (if right-side heart failure develops)
Fatigue and weakness increase with exercise and pregnancy.

===Natural history===
The natural history of mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic fever (the most common cause) is an asymptomatic latent phase following the initial episode of rheumatic fever. This latent period lasts an average of 16.3 ± 5.2 years. Once symptoms of mitral stenosis begin to develop, progression to severe disability takes 9.2 ± 4.3 years.

In individuals having been offered mitral valve surgery but refused, &quot;survival&quot; with medical therapy alone was 44 ± 6% at 5 years, and 32 ± 8% at 10 years after they were offered correction.

==Cause==

Almost all cases of mitral stenosis are due to disease in the heart secondary to rheumatic fever and the consequent rheumatic heart disease. Uncommon causes of mitral stenosis are calcification of the mitral valve leaflets, and as a form of congenital heart disease. It is the most common valvular heart disease in pregnancy.

Other causes include infective endocarditis where the vegetations may favor increase risk of stenosis. Other rare causes include mitral annular calcification, endomyocardial fibroelastosis, malignant carcinoid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, whipple disease, fabry disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. hurler&#x27; disease, hunter&#x27;s disease, amyloidosis.

==Pathophysiology==

The normal area of the mitral valve orifice is about 4 to 6 cm2. In normal cardiac physiology, the mitral valve opens during left ventricular diastole, to allow blood to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. A normal mitral valve will not impede the flow of blood from the left atrium to the left ventricle during (ventricular) diastole, and the pressures in the left atrium and the left ventricle during ventricular diastole will be equal. The result is that the left ventricle gets filled with blood during early ventricular diastole, with only a small portion of extra blood contributed by contraction of the left atrium (the &quot;atrial kick&quot;) during late ventricular diastole.

When the mitral valve area goes below 2 cm2, the valve causes an impediment to the flow of blood into the left ventricle, creating a pressure gradient across the mitral valve. This gradient may be increased by increases in the heart rate or cardiac output. As the gradient across the mitral valve increases, the amount of time necessary to fill the left ventricle with blood increases. Eventually, the left ventricle requires the atrial kick to fill with blood. As the heart rate increases, the amount of time that the ventricle is in diastole and can fill up with blood (called the diastolic filling period) decreases. When the heart rate goes above a certain point, the diastolic filling period is insufficient to fill the ventricle with blood and pressure builds up in the left atrium, leading to pulmonary congestion.

When the mitral valve area goes less than 1 cm2, there will be an increase in the left atrial pressures (required to push blood through the stenotic valve). Since the normal left ventricular diastolic pressures is about 5 mmHg, a pressure gradient across the mitral valve of 20 mmHg due to severe mitral stenosis will cause a left atrial pressure of about 25 mmHg. This left atrial pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature and causes pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary capillary pressures in this level cause an imbalance between the hydrostatic pressure and the oncotic pressure, leading to extravasation of fluid from the vascular tree and pooling of fluid in the lungs (congestive heart failure causing pulmonary edema).

The constant pressure overload of the left atrium will cause the left atrium to increase in size. As the left atrium increases in size, it becomes more prone to develop atrial fibrillation (AF).

In individuals with severe mitral stenosis, the left ventricular filling is dependent on the atrial kick. The loss of the atrial kick due to atrial fibrillation (i.e., blood cannot flow into the left ventricle thus accumulating in the left atrium ) can cause a precipitous decrease in cardiac output and sudden congestive heart failure.

Patients with mitral stenosis prompts a series of hemodynamic changes that frequently cause deterioration of the patient&#x27;s clinical status. A reduction in cardiac output, associated with acceleration of heart rate and shortening of the diastolic time, frequently leads to congestive heart failure. In addition, when AF sets in, systemic embolization becomes a real danger.

Mitral stenosis typically progresses slowly (over decades) from the initial signs of mitral stenosis to NYHA functional class II symptoms to the development of atrial fibrillation to the development of NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms. Once an individual develops NYHA class III or IV symptoms, the progression of the disease accelerates and the patient&#x27;s condition deteriorates.

==Diagnosis==

===Physical examination===

Upon auscultation of an individual with mitral stenosis, the first heart sound is usually loud and may be palpable (tapping apex beat) because of increased force in closing the mitral valve. The first heart sound is made by the mitral and tricuspid heart valves closing. These are normally synchronous, and the sounds are termed M1 and T1, respectively. M1 becomes louder in mitral stenosis. It may be the most prominent sign.

If pulmonary hypertension secondary to mitral stenosis is severe, the P2 (pulmonic) component of the second heart sound (S2) will become loud.

An opening snap that is a high-pitch additional sound may be heard after the A2 (aortic) component of the second heart sound (S2), which correlates to the forceful opening of the mitral valve. The mitral valve opens when the pressure in the left atrium is greater than the pressure in the left ventricle. This happens in ventricular diastole (after closure of the aortic valve), when the pressure in the ventricle precipitously drops. In individuals with mitral stenosis, the pressure in the left atrium correlates with the severity of the mitral stenosis. As the severity of the mitral stenosis increases, the pressure in the left atrium increases, and the mitral valve opens earlier in ventricular diastole.

A mid-diastolic rumbling murmur with presystolic accentuation will be heard after the opening snap. The murmur is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope. Its duration increases with worsening disease.

Advanced disease may present with signs of right-sided heart failure such as parasternal heave, jugular venous distension, hepatomegaly, ascites and/or pulmonary hypertension, the latter often presenting with a loud P2.

Almost all signs increase with exercise and pregnancy.

Other peripheral signs include:
* Malar flush - due to back pressure and buildup of carbon dioxide (). is a natural vasodilator.
* Atrial fibrillation - irregular pulse and loss of &#x27;a&#x27; wave in jugular venous pressure
* Left parasternal heave - presence of right ventricular hypertrophy due to pulmonary hypertension
* Tapping apex beat that is not displaced

Medical signs of atrial fibrillation include:

Heart rate is about 100-150/min. Irregularly irregular pulse with a pulse deficit&gt;10. Varying first heart sound intensity. Opening snap is not heard sometimes. Absent a waves in the neck veins. Presystolic accentuation of diastolic murmur disappears. Embolic manifestations may appear.

===Associated lesions===
With severe pulmonary hypertension, a pansystolic murmur produced by functional tricuspid regurgitation may be audible along the left sternal border. This murmur is usually louder during inspiration and diminishes during forced expiration (Carvallo&#x27;s sign). When the cardiac output is markedly reduced in MS, the typical auscultatory findings, including the diastolic rumbling murmur, may not be detectable (silent
MS), but they may reappear as compensation is restored. The Graham Steell murmur of pulmonary regurgitation, a high-pitched, diastolic, decrescendo blowing murmur along the left sternal border, results from dilation of the pulmonary valve ring and occurs in patients with mitral valve disease and severe pulmonary hypertension. This murmur may be indistinguishable from the more common murmur produced by aortic regurgitation (AR), although it may increase in intensity with inspiration and is accompanied by a loud and often palpable P2.
===Echocardiography===

In most cases, the diagnosis of mitral stenosis is most easily made by echocardiography, which shows left atrial enlargement, thick and calcified mitral valve with narrow and &quot;fish-mouth&quot;-shaped orifice and signs of right ventricular failure in advanced disease. It can also show decreased opening of the mitral valve leaflets, and increased blood flow velocity during diastole. The trans-mitral gradient as measured by Doppler echocardiography is the gold standard in the evaluation of the severity of mitral stenosis.

===Cardiac chamber catheterization===
Another method of measuring the severity of mitral stenosis is the simultaneous left and right heart chamber catheterization. The right heart catheterization (commonly known as Swan-Ganz catheterization) gives the physician the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which is a reflection of the left atrial pressure. The left heart catheterization, on the other hand, gives the pressure in the left ventricle. By simultaneously taking these pressures, it is possible to determine the gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle during ventricular diastole, which is a marker for the severity of mitral stenosis. This method of evaluating mitral stenosis tends to overestimate the degree of mitral stenosis, however, because of the time lag in the pressure tracings seen on the right-heart catheterization and the slow Y descent seen on the wedge tracings. If a trans-septal puncture is made during right heart catheterization, however, the pressure gradient can accurately quantify the severity of mitral stenosis.

===Other techniques===
Chest X-ray may also assist in diagnosis, showing left atrial enlargement.

Electrocardiography may show &quot;P mitrale&quot;, that is, broad, notched P waves in several or many leads with a prominent late negative component to the P wave in lead V1, and may also be seen in mitral regurgitation, and, potentially, any cause of overload of the left atrium. Thus, &quot;P-sinistrocardiale&quot; may be a more appropriate term.

==Treatment==
Treatment is not necessary in asymptomatic patients.

The treatment options for mitral stenosis include mitral valve replacement by surgery, and percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty by balloon catheter.

The indication for invasive treatment with either a mitral valve replacement or valvuloplasty is NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms.

Another option is balloon dilatation. To determine which patients would benefit from percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty, a scoring system has been developed. Scoring is based on 4 echocardiographic criteria: leaflet mobility, leaflet thickening, subvalvular thickening, and calcification. Individuals with a score of ≥ 8 tended to have suboptimal results. Superb results with valvotomy are seen in individuals with a crisp opening snap, score &lt; 8, and no calcium in the commissures.

Treatment also focuses on concomitant conditions often seen in mitral stenosis:
* Any angina is treated with short-acting nitrovasodilators, beta-blockers and/or calcium blockers
* Any hypertension is treated aggressively, but caution must be taken in administering beta-blockers
* Any heart failure is treated with digoxin, diuretics, nitrovasodilators and, if not contraindicated, cautious inpatient administration of ACE inhibitors

===Mitral valvuloplasty===
Mitral valvuloplasty is a minimally invasive therapeutic procedure to correct an uncomplicated mitral stenosis by dilating the valve using a balloon.
Under local anaesthetic, a catheter with a special balloon is passed from the right femoral vein, up the inferior vena cava and into the right atrium. The interatrial septum is punctured and the catheter passed into the left atrium using a &quot;trans-septal technique.&quot; The balloon is sub-divided into 3 segments and is dilated in 3 stages. First, the distal portion (lying in the left ventricle) is inflated and pulled against the valve cusps. Second, the proximal portion is dilated, in order to fix the centre segment at the valve orifice. Finally, the central section is inflated, this should take no longer than 30 seconds, since full inflation obstructs the valve and causes congestion, leading to circulatory arrest and flash pulmonary edema.

With careful patient pre-selection, percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) is associated with good success rates and a low rate of complications. By far the most serious adverse event is the occurrence of acute severe mitral regurgitation. Severe mitral regurgitation usually results from a tear in one of the valve leaflets or the subvalvular apparatus. It can lead to pulmonary edema and hemodynamic compromise, necessitating urgent surgical mitral valve replacement.

Other serious complications with PBMV usually relate to the technique of trans-septal puncture (TSP). The ideal site for TSP is the region of the fossa ovalis in the inter-atrial septum. Occasionally, however, the sharp needle used for TSP may inadvertently traumatize other cardiac structures, leading to cardiac tamponade or serious blood loss.

Although the immediate results of PBMV are often quite gratifying, the procedure does not provide permanent relief from mitral stenosis. Regular follow-up is mandatory, to detect restenosis. Long-term follow-up data from patients undergoing PBMV indicates that up to 70–75% individuals can be free of restenosis 10 years following the procedure. The number falls to about 40% 15 years post-PBMV.

<text>Junelyn Alexis &quot;Asia&quot; Unana Agcaoili (; born September 20, 1977) is a Filipina television and radio host, actress, recording artist, dancer, model, and former columnist. She was a member of the Viva Hot Babes girl group. Agcaoili presented the reality show &quot;Pinoy Big Brother&quot; on Studio 23 (2005–07), the basketball show &quot;iPBA&quot; (2006–07) on ABC, and the singing competition &quot;IKON Philippines&quot; (2007) on RPN. As an actress, she portrayed Roxanne in the ABS-CBN drama series &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot; (2007). 

Agcaoili is dubbed as a sex guru, having discussed sex and sexuality on her &quot;FHM&quot; &quot;Philippines&quot; column, direct-to-video releases, and other platforms. 

==Entertainment career==
Agcaoili was already a model when she joined the ABC reality show &quot;SINGLE&quot; in 2002. In four episodes, she bested the two other contestants to become the &quot;Single Girl&quot;. The show subsequently featured her for 13 episodes.

In 2003, she joined the second batch of the Viva Hot Babes, a girl group known for double entendre lyrics, sensual performances, as well as appearances in men&#x27;s magazines and films. The group released three EPs before disbanding in 2008. With her fellow Hot Babes, Agcaoili appeared in the film &quot;First Time&quot; (2003) and then starred in the sexually-informative direct-to-video films &quot;Sex Guru&quot; (2004) and &quot;Erotica: Lessons of the Flesh&quot; (2005).

In March 2004, Agcaoili was suspended for 20 days by ABS-CBN after her left breast was exposed during a Viva Hot Babes dance performance for the live variety show &quot;MTB&quot;. She explained that the incident was unintentional. In July that year, she appeared on the cover of &quot;FHM Philippines&quot; and became the magazine&#x27;s sex columnist, writing monthly until 2009. She also appeared several times on the magazine&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Women list, with her highest rank being 13th place in 2005 and 2006.

In ABS-CBN, Agcaoili appeared in the &quot;teleseryes&quot; &quot;Basta&#x27;t Kasama Kita&quot; (2003–04) and &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot; (2005). As a television presenter, she hosted the &quot;Pinoy Big Brother&quot; broadcast on Studio 23 (&quot;Pinoy Big Brother: Si Kuya, KaBarkada Mo&quot;). On ABC, she hosted &quot;iPBA&quot; (2006–07), the recap and analysis show of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). She then hosted the singing competition &quot;IKON Philippines&quot; (2007) on RPN.

In radio, she was a disc jockey on the radio station Magic 89.9 until January 14, 2007.

Her first television appearance in New Zealand was in a 2020 COVID-19 public service announcement.

==Personal life==
Agcaoili graduated from the University of the Philippines Diliman with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in clothing technology.

She moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands in 2007 to join her boyfriend, Dutch computer programmer Bram van der Kolk. She gave birth to their son, Xander, in April 2009. The couple then married on September 9 that year. During her time in the Netherlands, she took Dutch integration courses at the University of Amsterdam. She also met with the self-exiled communist leader Jose Maria Sison.

Agcaoili, along with her husband and son, later moved to Auckland, New Zealand. There, Van der Kolk worked as the chief programmer of Megaupload. He, along with his colleagues, were charged with copyright infringement, racketeering, and money laundering when the company was shut down in 2012. When the company was re-launched as Mega in 2013, Van der Kolk was retained as chief programmer while Agcaoili became a shareholder.

She is bisexual.

Little appeared in a string of Australian films and TV series during the 1980s, including &quot;Short Changed&quot; (1986), written by Aboriginal playwright Bob Merritt and directed by George Ogilvie. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in the AFI Awards for this role.

Little appeared as Roy in a production of Louis Nowra&#x27;s play &quot;Così&quot; at The White Bear Theatre in Kennington, London, in 2008. From the following year, he started making regular appearances on the discussion show &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;.

As well as extended runs of &quot;Defending the Caveman&quot; at London&#x27;s Leicester Square Theatre, he toured the play around the UK in 2010.

In 2010, he made his directorial debut starring in, designing and directing Jack Hibberd&#x27;s &quot;A Stretch of the Imagination&quot; at The Cock Tavern Theatre in Kilburn, London.

Little has also written comedy films and poetry. He appeared in a documentary special celebrating &quot;Neighbours&quot;″ 30th anniversary titled &quot;Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite&quot;, which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015.

In 2017, Little played the character of &quot;Fleshcreep&quot; in a pantomime production of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; at the Palace Theatre, Mansfield.

In 2019, Little took part in the eleventh series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, partnered with Brianne Delcourt. They become the first couple to leave after the judges chose to save ex-cricketer Ryan Sidebottom and his skating partner Brandee Malto in the skate-off.

He has also taken many self-devised shows to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and toured them nationally throughout the UK.

In 2021, he appeared at the Middlesbrough Little Theatre in a pantomime production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, playing the part of Captain Hook.

In 2022, he reprised his role as Joe Mangel for the ending of &quot;Neighbours&quot;.

<text>Pamir was a four-masted barque built for the German shipping company F. Laeisz. One of their famous Flying P-Liners, she was the last commercial sailing ship to round Cape Horn, in 1949. By 1957, she had been outmoded by modern bulk carriers and could not operate at a profit. Her shipping consortium&#x27;s inability to finance much-needed repairs or to recruit sufficient sail-trained officers caused severe technical difficulties. On 21 September 1957, she was caught in Hurricane Carrie and sank off the Azores, with only six survivors rescued after an extensive search.

== History ==

===Early days and World War I ===
She was built at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyards in Hamburg, launched on 29 July 1905. She had a steel hull and tonnage of 3,020 GRT (2,777 net). She had an overall length of 114.5 m (375 ft), a beam of about 14 m (46 ft) and a draught of 7.25 m (23.5 ft). Three masts stood 51.2 m (168 ft) above deck and the main yard was 28 m (92 ft) wide. She carried 3,800 m² (40,900 ft²) of sails and could reach a top speed of . Her regular cruise speed was around 8-9 knots.

She was the fifth of ten near-sister ships. She was commissioned on 18 October 1905 and used by the Laeisz company in the South American nitrate trade. By 1914, she had made eight voyages to Chile, taking between 64 and about 70 days for a one-way trip from Hamburg to Valparaíso or Iquique, the foremost Chilean nitrate ports at the time. From October 1914, she stayed in Santa Cruz de la Palma port in La Palma Island, Canary Islands. Due to post war conditions, she did not return from Santa Cruz de la Palma to Hamburg until 17 March 1920.

In the same year, she was handed over to Italy as war reparation. On 15 July 1920, she left Hamburg via Rotterdam to Naples towed by tugs. The Italian government was unable to find a deep-water sailing ship crew, so she was laid up near Castellamare in the Gulf of Naples.

In 1924, the F. Laeisz Company bought her back for £7,000 and put her into service in the nitrate trade again. Laeisz sold her in 1931 to the Finnish shipping company of Gustaf Erikson, which used her in the Australian wheat trade.

=== World War II and beyond===

During World War II, &quot;Pamir&quot; was seized as a prize of war by the New Zealand government on 3 August 1941 while in port at Wellington. Ten commercial voyages were made under the New Zealand flag: five to San Francisco, three to Vancouver, one to Sydney and her last voyage across the Tasman from Sydney to Wellington carrying 2,700 tons of cement and 400 tons of nail wire. Weathering a storm during the last Tasman voyage is described in detail by one of the mates, Andrew Keyworth, in a letter never posted.
She escaped the war unscathed despite a close call in 1943 when a Japanese submarine was spotted. Evidently as a fast-moving barque under a strong and fair wind, she did not interest the submarine&#x27;s commander. After the war, she made one voyage from Wellington via Cape Horn to London, then Antwerp to Auckland and Wellington in 1948.

She was returned to the Erikson Line on 12 November 1948 at Wellington and sailed to Port Victoria on Spencer Gulf to load Australian grain. On her 128-day journey to Falmouth, she was the last windjammer carrying a commercial load around Cape Horn, on 11 July 1949.

Gustaf Erikson had died in 1947. His son Edgar found he could no longer operate her (or &quot;Passat&quot;) at a profit, owing primarily to changing regulations and union contracts governing employment aboard ships; the standard two-watch system on sailing ships was replaced by the three-watch system in use on motor-ships, requiring more crew.

In March 1951, Belgian shipbreakers paid £40,000 for her and &quot;Passat&quot;. As she was being towed to Antwerp, German shipowner Heinz Schliewen, who had sailed on her in the late 1920s, bought her (and &quot;Passat&quot;, thus often erroneously referred to as a sister ship). The ships were modernized with refurbished quarters to accommodate merchant marine trainees and fitted with an auxiliary engine, a refrigeration system for the galleys (precluding the need to carry live animals for fresh meat), modern communications equipment and water ballast tanks. Her first trip was to Brazil in 1952 with cement, to return to Germany with iron ore. Early in the outbound voyage the propeller dropped off, &quot;much to the satisfaction of the sail-favoring crew if not the owner.&quot; The enterprise went briefly bankrupt but was bought by a new consortium of 40 German shipowners. For the next five years, the ships continued to sail between Europe and the east coast of South America, but not around Cape Horn. They were used as cargo-carrying school ships, primarily to Argentina. Although the German public supported the concept as maritime symbols and sources of national pride, the economic realities of the post-war years placed restraints on the operation. The ships were no longer profitable as freight haulers, and &quot;Pamir&quot; had increasing technical problems such as leaking decks and serious corrosion. The consortium was unable to get sufficient increased funding from German governments or contributions from shipping companies or public donations, and thus let both vessels deteriorate.

===Last voyage===

Due to ill health, her regular captain, Hermann Eggers, had been replaced by Captain Johannes Diebitsch, who had sailed on her as a young seaman and had commanded sail-training ships, but had little experience as master of cargo-carrying sailing ships. His first officer, Rolf Köhler, was only 29 at the time, and wrote that he was &quot;getting thin with anger&quot; over the state of the ship and that he was intending to quit the ship&#x27;s company after arriving home from the next voyage. Captain Diebitsch was criticized for being a harsh and inflexible officer.

On 10 August 1957, she left Buenos Aires for Hamburg with a crew of 86, including 52 cadets. Her cargo of 3,780 tons of barley was stored loose in the holds and ballast tanks, secured by 255 tons in sacks on top of the loose grain. Records indicate that this was one of the major mistakes implicated in the sinking – she had been held up by a dockworkers&#x27; strike, and Diebitsch, under severe pressure to sail, decided to let the trimming (the correct storage of loose cargo so that it does not shift in the hold) be done by his own untrained crew. It was later found that he also had the ballast tank filled with barley. Even though testing of the roll period (the time the ship took to right itself after load transfers) showed that she was dangerously unstable, Diebitsch decided to sail.

On the morning of 21 September 1957, she was caught in Hurricane Carrie before shortening sails. It was later considered that because the radio officer had also been given substantial administrative tasks (to save the money required for another officer&#x27;s position), he had likely not received any of the radio storm warnings. She had also not responded to radio hails by ships that had sighted her earlier in the voyage. She soon listed severely to port in the sudden storm. As hatchways and other openings were not closed at once, they probably allowed considerable amounts of water to enter, as found by the commission which examined the probable causes of the sinking. The shipping company&#x27;s lawyer at the investigation claimed that the water entered her due to a leak. According to the commission, the water caused her to list further and the grain to shift, which aggravated the list.

The captain did not order the flooding of her grain-filled ballast tanks, which would have helped her to right herself. Once she listed severely, the lifeboats could not be deployed because her port side was underwater and her starboard side was raised to an angle that did not allow use of the boats.

She sent distress signals before capsizing at 13:03 local time, and sinking after drifting keel-up for 30 minutes in the middle of the Atlantic west-southwest of the Azores at position . Three damaged lifeboats that had come loose before or during the capsizing and the only lifeboat that had been deployed were drifting nearby. None contained any provisions or working distress signal rockets. Many sharks were later seen near the position.

A nine-day search for survivors was organized by the United States Coast Guard Cutter , but only four crewmen and two cadets were rescued alive, from two of the lifeboats. It was reported that many of the 86 men aboard had managed to reach the boats, but most died in the next three days. As none of the officers nor the captain survived, the reasons for the capsizing remained uncertain.

The sinking made headlines around the world; it was a national tragedy in Germany.

== Aftermath ==
=== False coverage ===

The sinking received extensive but not always accurate press coverage. For example, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported the following fabrication mixing the real event with imagined details, supposedly directly based on the survivor &quot;Gunter Hasselback&quot; (his real name was Günter Haselbach):

:&quot;‘The Loss of the Pamir’&quot;
:&quot;Last of the ‘P’ Line&quot;

:&quot;“Overwhelmed in a hurricane off the Azores on September 21, 1957, - complement of about 80 crew and training cadets – 5 survivors picked up on Tuesday, 24th. Survivors tell of how terror struck into the hearts of the naval cadets in the Pamir when huge waves tossed her around like a shuttle cock. Her cargo of wheat shifted and she took on a 45 degree list. Her crew fought to right her and to calm the cadets who were making their first sea voyage, but hysteria gripped them. The captain (Diebitsch) led the cadets in prayer but it was impossible to calm them. He ordered them away in three boats with three experienced hands in each. As the boats were launched they were caught by the mountainous waves and sent hurtling hundreds of feet away from the ship. The boats had hardly been launched when the masts snapped and her sails were blown away. The pounding of the seas and the drag of the masts and rigging over the side, heeled the ship over further and further. It was now impossible to keep the Pamir’s bows head into the wind – she was lying broadside on. There was no time to send another SOS (aerials were down) – the end was here. In the trough of a giant wave she rolled right over and we last saw her was her bottom up and going down by the bow like a submarine slowly diving. The few men who were still on board when she capsized were struggling in the water. I don’t know how we got away but it seemed to me that our lifeboat was the only one successfully launched. We had no flares or smoke signals that worked. I could see nothing of the three boats in which the cadets had been put out from the ship. Seventeen of the men in my boat were washed overboard in the hurricane while rescue aircraft were flying overhead above the storm. Three others, screaming like demons, jumped overboard into the sea on Monday afternoon. I was too weak to stop them. If you had not found me on Tuesday, I would have done the same thing myself.&quot;&quot;

:&quot;Gunter Hasselback&quot;

The facts as reported by the survivors and established by the Seeamt Lübeck, the German authority that investigated the sinking, are that Haselbach was the only survivor rescued from the second lifeboat, not one of the five survivors found together as the article suggests; &quot;Pamir&quot; had a cargo of barley, not wheat. It is not certain when the cargo shifted; the official opinion of the investigation indicated it was early in the storm, but others have suggested it shifted only at the very end; the cadets had already gone from Hamburg to Buenos Aires before they started the return trip.

The survivors reported that crew and cadets stayed very calm until close to the loss of the ship because the ship was not believed to be in difficulties – cadets were still taking photographs, and supposedly some complained when ordered to put on life jackets. Even at the very end, there was no panic. She was not going head into the wind at any time, and her engine was not used.

She was mounted more and more to the wind, with waves, more from abaft the beam (behind), hitting roughly from the side. Radio contact was maintained until the end. She sent her last audible SOS call at 12:54 and an indecipherable one at 13:03; she was capsizing around this time. At least one lifeboat broke free before the capsize; others detached briefly before or during the capsizing and sinking. Nobody boarded a lifeboat before she capsized, and nobody jumped overboard: when she capsized, all 86 men were still on board.

Her masts did not break nor did any yards or anything else fall down, so nothing was dragging to the side. Some sails were left until they were blown out, but others were shortened or cut off by the crew; the headsail had to be cut with knives before it would blow out. When she sank, she still had set about a third of the mizzen sail and some tarpaulin in the shrouds of the mizzen mast.

The boat that Haselbach reached was badly damaged (as were the other two that were salvaged) and almost entirely submerged when he was rescued. Nothing indicates that four boats were manned - the existence of a third manned boat is only assumed, mostly on grounds of survivors&#x27; reports of seeing flares one night. Of the 20 or 22 men who were on Haselbach&#x27;s boat, ten were still on board 24 hours before he was rescued, after the hurricane dissipated. The rescue aircraft could be deployed only after the storm had calmed down. The official documents, including a report by Haselbach during the hours after he was found, say nothing about people screaming when they left the lifeboats.

The &quot;Pamir&quot; was not last of the ‘P’ Line, as the newspaper&#x27;s subtitle suggests. The &quot;Passat&quot; was still in service, and other ‘P’ Liners still existed but not under sail, including the &quot;Kruzenshtern&quot; (ex &quot;Padua&quot;, the only ‘P’ Liner still under sail), the &quot;Peking&quot; and the &quot;Pommern&quot;.

=== Insurance ===
&quot;Pamir&quot;″s last voyage was the only one in her school ship career during which she made a profit, as the insurance sum of about 2.2 million Deutsche Mark was sufficient to cover the company losses for that year. While there was no indication that this was the intention of the consortium, which was never legally blamed for the sinking, some later researchers have considered that through its neglect it was at least strongly implicated in the loss. However, the Germanischer Lloyd had recently certified her as seaworthy.

<doc id="646116" wikidata="Q1969721" url="?curid=646116" title="K3 surface">
<text>In mathematics, a complex analytic K3 surface is a compact connected complex manifold of dimension 2 with а trivial canonical bundle and irregularity zero. An (algebraic) K3 surface over any field means a smooth proper geometrically connected algebraic surface that satisfies the same conditions. In the Enriques–Kodaira classification of surfaces, K3 surfaces form one of the four classes of minimal surfaces of Kodaira dimension zero. A simple example is the Fermat quartic surface
:formula_1
in complex projective 3-space.

Together with two-dimensional compact complex tori, K3 surfaces are the Calabi–Yau manifolds (and also the hyperkähler manifolds) of dimension two. As such, they are at the center of the classification of algebraic surfaces, between the positively curved del Pezzo surfaces (which are easy to classify) and the negatively curved surfaces of general type (which are essentially unclassifiable). K3 surfaces can be considered the simplest algebraic varieties whose structure does not reduce to curves or abelian varieties, and yet where a substantial understanding is possible. A complex K3 surface has real dimension 4, and it plays an important role in the study of smooth 4-manifolds. K3 surfaces have been applied to Kac–Moody algebras, mirror symmetry and string theory.

It can be useful to think of complex algebraic K3 surfaces as part of the broader family of complex analytic K3 surfaces. Many other types of algebraic varieties do not have such non-algebraic deformations.

==Definition==
There are several equivalent ways to define K3 surfaces. The only compact complex surfaces with trivial canonical bundle are K3 surfaces and compact complex tori, and so one can add any condition excluding the latter to define K3 surfaces. For example, it is equivalent to define a complex analytic K3 surface as a simply connected compact complex manifold of dimension 2 with a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic 2-form. (The latter condition says exactly that the canonical bundle is trivial.)

There are also some variants of the definition. Over the complex numbers, some authors consider only the algebraic K3 surfaces. (An algebraic K3 surface is automatically projective.) Or one may allow K3 surfaces to have du Val singularities (the canonical singularities of dimension 2), rather than being smooth.

==Calculation of the Betti numbers==
The Betti numbers of a complex analytic K3 surface are computed as follows. (A similar argument gives the same answer for the Betti numbers of an algebraic K3 surface over any field, defined using l-adic cohomology.) By definition, the canonical bundle formula_2 is trivial, and the irregularity &quot;q&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) (the dimension formula_3 of the coherent sheaf cohomology group formula_4) is zero. By Serre duality,
:formula_5

As a result, the arithmetic genus (or holomorphic Euler characteristic) of &quot;X&quot; is:
:formula_6
On the other hand, the Riemann–Roch theorem (Noether&#x27;s formula) says: 
:formula_7
where formula_8 is the &quot;i&quot;-th Chern class of the tangent bundle. Since formula_9 is trivial, its first Chern class formula_10 is zero, and so formula_11.

Next, the exponential sequence formula_12 gives an exact sequence of cohomology groups formula_13, and so formula_14. Thus the Betti number formula_15 is zero, and by Poincaré duality, formula_16 is also zero. Finally, formula_11 is equal to the topological Euler characteristic
:formula_18
Since formula_19 and formula_20, it follows that formula_21.

==Properties==
*Any two complex analytic K3 surfaces are diffeomorphic as smooth 4-manifolds, by Kunihiko Kodaira.
*Every complex analytic K3 surface has a Kähler metric, by Yum-Tong Siu. (Analogously, but much easier: every algebraic K3 surface over a field is projective.) By Shing-Tung Yau&#x27;s solution to the Calabi conjecture, it follows that every complex analytic K3 surface has a Ricci-flat Kähler metric.
*The Hodge numbers of any K3 surface are listed in the Hodge diamond:
*:One way to show this is to calculate the Jacobian ideal of a specific K3 surface, and then using a variation of Hodge structure on the moduli of algebraic K3 surfaces to show that all such K3 surfaces have the same Hodge numbers. A more low-brow calculation can be done using the calculation of the Betti numbers along with the parts of the Hodge structure computed on formula_22 for an arbitrary K3 surface. In this case, Hodge symmetry forces formula_23, hence formula_24. For K3 surfaces in characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0, this was first shown by Alexey Rudakov and Igor Shafarevich.
*For a complex analytic K3 surface &quot;X&quot;, the intersection form (or cup product) on formula_25 is a symmetric bilinear form with values in the integers, known as the K3 lattice. This is isomorphic to the even unimodular lattice formula_26, or equivalently formula_27, where &quot;U&quot; is the hyperbolic lattice of rank 2 and formula_28 is the E8 lattice.
*Yukio Matsumoto&#x27;s 11/8 conjecture predicts that every smooth oriented 4-manifold &quot;X&quot; with even intersection form has second Betti number at least 11/8 times the absolute value of the signature. This would be optimal if true, since equality holds for a complex K3 surface, which has signature 3−19 = −16. The conjecture would imply that every simply connected smooth 4-manifold with even intersection form is homeomorphic to a connected sum of copies of the K3 surface and of formula_29.
*Every complex surface that is diffeomorphic to a K3 surface is a K3 surface, by Robert Friedman and John Morgan. On the other hand, there are smooth complex surfaces (some of them projective) that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to a K3 surface, by Kodaira and Michael Freedman. These &quot;homotopy K3 surfaces&quot; all have Kodaira dimension 1.

==Examples==
*The double cover &quot;X&quot; of the projective plane branched along a smooth sextic (degree 6) curve is a K3 surface of genus 2 (that is, degree 2&quot;g&quot;−2 = 2). (This terminology means that the inverse image in &quot;X&quot; of a general hyperplane in formula_30 is a smooth curve of genus 2.)
*A smooth quartic (degree 4) surface in formula_31 is a K3 surface of genus 3 (that is, degree 4).
*A Kummer surface is the quotient of a two-dimensional abelian variety &quot;A&quot; by the action formula_32. This results in 16 singularities, at the 2-torsion points of &quot;A&quot;. The minimal resolution of this singular surface may also be called a Kummer surface; that resolution is a K3 surface. When &quot;A&quot; is the Jacobian of a curve of genus 2, Kummer showed that the quotient formula_33 can be embedded into formula_31 as a quartic surface with 16 nodes.
*More generally: for any quartic surface &quot;Y&quot; with du Val singularities, the minimal resolution of &quot;Y&quot; is an algebraic K3 surface.
*The intersection of a quadric and a cubic in formula_35 is a K3 surface of genus 4 (that is, degree 6).
*The intersection of three quadrics in formula_36 is a K3 surface of genus 5 (that is, degree 8).
*There are several databases of K3 surfaces with du Val singularities in weighted projective spaces.

==The Picard lattice==
The Picard group Pic(&quot;X&quot;) of a complex analytic K3 surface &quot;X&quot; is the abelian group of complex analytic line bundles on &quot;X&quot;. For an algebraic K3 surface, Pic(&quot;X&quot;) is the group of algebraic line bundles on &quot;X&quot;. The two definitions agree for a complex algebraic K3 surface, by Jean-Pierre Serre&#x27;s GAGA theorem.

The Picard group of a K3 surface &quot;X&quot; is always a finitely generated free abelian group; its rank is called the Picard number formula_37. In the complex case, Pic(&quot;X&quot;) is a subgroup of formula_25. It is an important feature of K3 surfaces that many different Picard numbers can occur. For &quot;X&quot; a complex algebraic K3 surface, formula_37 can be any integer between 1 and 20. In the complex analytic case, formula_37 may also be zero. (In that case, &quot;X&quot; contains no closed complex curves at all. By contrast, an algebraic surface always contains many continuous families of curves.) Over an algebraically closed field of characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0, there is a special class of K3 surfaces, supersingular K3 surfaces, with Picard number 22.

The Picard lattice of a K3 surface is the abelian group Pic(&quot;X&quot;) together with its intersection form, a symmetric bilinear form with values in the integers. (Over formula_41, the intersection form is the restriction of the intersection form on formula_42. Over a general field, the intersection form can be defined using the intersection theory of curves on a surface, by identifying the Picard group with the divisor class group.) The Picard lattice of a K3 surface is always &quot;even&quot;, meaning that the integer formula_43 is even for each formula_44.

The Hodge index theorem implies that the Picard lattice of an algebraic K3 surface has signature formula_45. Many properties of a K3 surface are determined by its Picard lattice, as a symmetric bilinear form over the integers. This leads to a strong connection between the theory of K3 surfaces and the arithmetic of symmetric bilinear forms. As a first example of this connection: a complex analytic K3 surface is algebraic if and only if there is an element formula_44 with formula_47.

Roughly speaking, the space of all complex analytic K3 surfaces has complex dimension 20, while the space of K3 surfaces with Picard number formula_37 has dimension formula_49 (excluding the supersingular case). In particular, algebraic K3 surfaces occur in 19-dimensional families. More details about moduli spaces of K3 surfaces are given below.

The precise description of which lattices can occur as Picard lattices of K3 surfaces is complicated. One clear statement, due to Viacheslav Nikulin and David Morrison, is that every even lattice of signature formula_45 with formula_51 is the Picard lattice of some complex projective K3 surface. The space of such surfaces has dimension formula_49.

==Elliptic K3 surfaces==
An important subclass of K3 surfaces, easier to analyze than the general case, consists of the K3 surfaces with an elliptic fibration formula_53. &quot;Elliptic&quot; means that all but finitely many fibers of this morphism are smooth curves of genus 1. The singular fibers are unions of rational curves, with the possible types of singular fibers classified by Kodaira. There are always some singular fibers, since the sum of the topological Euler characteristics of the singular fibers is formula_54. A general elliptic K3 surface has exactly 24 singular fibers, each of type formula_55 (a nodal cubic curve).

Whether a K3 surface is elliptic can be read from its Picard lattice. Namely, in characteristic not 2 or 3, a K3 surface &quot;X&quot; has an elliptic fibration if and only if there is a nonzero element formula_44 with formula_57. (In characteristic 2 or 3, the latter condition may also correspond to a quasi-elliptic fibration.) It follows that having an elliptic fibration is a codimension-1 condition on a K3 surface. So there are 19-dimensional families of complex analytic K3 surfaces with an elliptic fibration, and 18-dimensional moduli spaces of projective K3 surfaces with an elliptic fibration.

Example: Every smooth quartic surface &quot;X&quot; in formula_31 that contains a line &quot;L&quot; has an elliptic fibration formula_59, given by projecting away from &quot;L&quot;. The moduli space of all smooth quartic surfaces (up to isomorphism) has dimension 19, while the subspace of quartic surfaces containing a line has dimension 18.

==Rational curves on K3 surfaces==
In contrast to positively curved varieties such as del Pezzo surfaces, a complex algebraic K3 surface &quot;X&quot; is not uniruled; that is, it is not covered by a continuous family of rational curves. On the other hand, in contrast to negatively curved varieties such as surfaces of general type, &quot;X&quot; contains a large discrete set of rational curves (possibly singular). In particular, Fedor Bogomolov and David Mumford showed that every curve on &quot;X&quot; is linearly equivalent to a positive linear combination of rational curves.

Another contrast to negatively curved varieties is that the Kobayashi metric on a complex analytic K3 surface &quot;X&quot; is identically zero. The proof uses that an algebraic K3 surface &quot;X&quot; is always covered by a continuous family of images of elliptic curves. (These curves are singular in &quot;X&quot;, unless &quot;X&quot; happens to be an elliptic K3 surface.) A stronger question that remains open is whether every complex K3 surface admits a nondegenerate holomorphic map from formula_60 (where &quot;nondegenerate&quot; means that the derivative of the map is an isomorphism at some point).

==The period map==
Define a marking of a complex analytic K3 surface &quot;X&quot; to be an isomorphism of lattices from formula_42 to the K3 lattice formula_62. The space &quot;N&quot; of marked complex K3 surfaces is a non-Hausdorff complex manifold of dimension 20. The set of isomorphism classes of complex analytic K3 surfaces is the quotient of &quot;N&quot; by the orthogonal group formula_63, but this quotient is not a geometrically meaningful moduli space, because the action of formula_63 is far from being properly discontinuous. (For example, the space of smooth quartic surfaces is irreducible of dimension 19, and yet every complex analytic K3 surface in the 20-dimensional family &quot;N&quot; has arbitrarily small deformations which are isomorphic to smooth quartics.) For the same reason, there is not a meaningful moduli space of compact complex tori of dimension at least 2.

The period mapping sends a K3 surface to its Hodge structure. When stated carefully, the Torelli theorem holds: a K3 surface is determined by its Hodge structure. The period domain is defined as the 20-dimensional complex manifold
:formula_65
The period mapping formula_66 sends a marked K3 surface &quot;X&quot; to the complex line formula_67. This is surjective, and a local isomorphism, but not an isomorphism (in particular because &quot;D&quot; is Hausdorff and &quot;N&quot; is not). However, the global Torelli theorem for K3 surfaces says that the quotient map of sets
:formula_68
is bijective. It follows that two complex analytic K3 surfaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are isomorphic if and only if there is a Hodge isometry from formula_42 to formula_70, that is, an isomorphism of abelian groups that preserves the intersection form and sends formula_71 to formula_72.

==Moduli spaces of projective K3 surfaces==
A polarized K3 surface &quot;X&quot; of genus &quot;g&quot; is defined to be a projective K3 surface together with an ample line bundle &quot;L&quot; such that &quot;L&quot; is primitive (that is, not 2 or more times another line bundle) and formula_73. This is also called a polarized K3 surface of degree 2&quot;g&quot;−2.

Under these assumptions, &quot;L&quot; is basepoint-free. In characteristic zero, Bertini&#x27;s theorem implies that there is a smooth curve &quot;C&quot; in the linear system |&quot;L&quot;|. All such curves have genus &quot;g&quot;, which explains why (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;L&quot;) is said to have genus &quot;g&quot;.

The vector space of sections of &quot;L&quot; has dimension &quot;g&quot; + 1, and so &quot;L&quot; gives a morphism from &quot;X&quot; to projective space formula_74. In most cases, this morphism is an embedding, so that &quot;X&quot; is isomorphic to a surface of degree 2&quot;g&quot;−2 in formula_74.

There is an irreducible coarse moduli space formula_76 of polarized complex K3 surfaces of genus &quot;g&quot; for each formula_77; it can be viewed as a Zariski open subset of a Shimura variety for the group &quot;SO&quot;(2,19). For each &quot;g&quot;, formula_76 is a quasi-projective complex variety of dimension 19. Shigeru Mukai showed that this moduli space is unirational if formula_79 or formula_80. In contrast, Valery Gritsenko, Klaus Hulek and Gregory Sankaran showed that formula_76 is of general type if formula_82 or formula_83. A survey of this area was given by .

The different 19-dimensional moduli spaces formula_76 overlap in an intricate way. Indeed, there is a countably infinite set of codimension-1 subvarieties of each formula_76 corresponding to K3 surfaces of Picard number at least 2. Those K3 surfaces have polarizations of infinitely many different degrees, not just 2&quot;g&quot;–2. So one can say that infinitely many of the other moduli spaces formula_86 meet formula_76. This is imprecise, since there is not a well-behaved space containing all the moduli spaces formula_76. However, a concrete version of this idea is the fact that any two complex algebraic K3 surfaces are deformation-equivalent through algebraic K3 surfaces.

More generally, a quasi-polarized K3 surface of genus &quot;g&quot; means a projective K3 surface with a primitive nef and big line bundle &quot;L&quot; such that formula_73. Such a line bundle still gives a morphism to formula_74, but now it may contract finitely many (−2)-curves, so that the image &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is singular. (A (−2)-curve on a surface means a curve isomorphic to formula_91 with self-intersection −2.) The moduli space of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces of genus &quot;g&quot; is still irreducible of dimension 19 (containing the previous moduli space as an open subset). Formally, it works better to view this as a moduli space of K3 surfaces &quot;Y&quot; with du Val singularities.

==The ample cone and the cone of curves==
A remarkable feature of algebraic K3 surfaces is that the Picard lattice determines many geometric properties of the surface, including the convex cone of ample divisors (up to automorphisms of the Picard lattice). The ample cone is determined by the Picard lattice as follows. By the Hodge index theorem, the intersection form on the real vector space formula_92 has signature formula_45. It follows that the set of elements of formula_94 with positive self-intersection has two connected components. Call the positive cone the component that contains any ample divisor on &quot;X&quot;.

Case 1: There is no element &quot;u&quot; of Pic(&quot;X&quot;) with formula_95. Then the ample cone is equal to the positive cone. Thus it is the standard round cone.

Case 2: Otherwise, let formula_96, the set of roots of the Picard lattice. The orthogonal complements of the roots form a set of hyperplanes which all go through the positive cone. Then the ample cone is a connected component of the complement of these hyperplanes in the positive cone. Any two such components are isomorphic via the orthogonal group of the lattice Pic(&quot;X&quot;), since that contains the reflection across each root hyperplane. In this sense, the Picard lattice determines the ample cone up to isomorphism.

A related statement, due to Sándor Kovács, is that knowing one ample divisor &quot;A&quot; in Pic(&quot;X&quot;) determines the whole cone of curves of &quot;X&quot;. Namely, suppose that &quot;X&quot; has Picard number formula_97. If the set of roots formula_98 is empty, then the closed cone of curves is the closure of the positive cone. Otherwise, the closed cone of curves is the closed convex cone spanned by all elements formula_99 with formula_100. In the first case, &quot;X&quot; contains no (−2)-curves; in the second case, the closed cone of curves is the closed convex cone spanned by all (−2)-curves. (If formula_101, there is one other possibility: the cone of curves may be spanned by one (−2)-curve and one curve with self-intersection 0.) So the cone of curves is either the standard round cone, or else it has &quot;sharp corners&quot; (because every (−2)-curve spans an &quot;isolated&quot; extremal ray of the cone of curves).

==Automorphism group==
K3 surfaces are somewhat unusual among algebraic varieties in that their automorphism groups may be infinite, discrete, and highly nonabelian. By a version of the Torelli theorem, the Picard lattice of a complex algebraic K3 surface &quot;X&quot; determines the automorphism group of &quot;X&quot; up to commensurability. Namely, let the Weyl group &quot;W&quot; be the subgroup of the orthogonal group &quot;O&quot;(Pic(&quot;X&quot;)) generated by reflections in the set of roots formula_98. Then &quot;W&quot; is a normal subgroup of &quot;O&quot;(Pic(&quot;X&quot;)), and the automorphism group of &quot;X&quot; is commensurable with the quotient group &quot;O&quot;(Pic(&quot;X&quot;))/&quot;W&quot;. A related statement, due to Hans Sterk, is that Aut(&quot;X&quot;) acts on the nef cone of &quot;X&quot; with a rational polyhedral fundamental domain.

==Relation to string duality==
K3 surfaces appear almost ubiquitously in string duality and provide an important tool for the understanding of it. String compactifications on these surfaces are not trivial, yet they are simple enough to analyze most of their properties in detail. The type IIA string, the type IIB string, the E8×E8 heterotic string, the Spin(32)/Z2 heterotic string, and M-theory are related by compactification on a K3 surface. For example, the Type IIA string compactified on a K3 surface is equivalent to the heterotic string compactified on a 4-torus ().

==History==
Quartic surfaces in formula_31 were studied by Ernst Kummer, Arthur Cayley, Friedrich Schur and other 19th-century geometers. More generally, Federigo Enriques observed in 1893 that for various numbers &quot;g&quot;, there are surfaces of degree 2&quot;g&quot;−2 in formula_74 with trivial canonical bundle and irregularity zero. In 1909, Enriques showed that such surfaces exist for all formula_105, and Francesco Severi showed that the moduli space of such surfaces has dimension 19 for each &quot;g&quot;.

André gave K3 surfaces their name (see the quotation above) and made several influential conjectures about their classification. Kunihiko Kodaira completed the basic theory around 1960, in particular making the first systematic study of complex analytic K3 surfaces which are not algebraic. He showed that any two complex analytic K3 surfaces are deformation-equivalent and hence diffeomorphic, which was new even for algebraic K3 surfaces. An important later advance was the proof of the Torelli theorem for complex algebraic K3 surfaces by Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro and Igor Shafarevich (1971), extended to complex analytic K3 surfaces by Daniel Burns and Michael Rapoport (1975).

<doc id="646120" wikidata="Q3082377" url="?curid=646120" title="Hyperkähler manifold">
<text>In differential geometry, a hyperkähler manifold is a Riemannian manifold formula_1 endowed with three integrable almost complex structures formula_2 that are Kähler with respect to the Riemannian metric formula_3 and satisfy the quaternionic relations formula_4. In particular, it is a hypercomplex manifold. All hyperkähler manifolds are Ricci-flat and are thus Calabi–Yau manifolds.

Hyperkähler manifolds were defined by Eugenio Calabi in 1979.

== Early history ==

Marcel Berger&#x27;s 1955 paper on the classification of Riemannian holonomy groups first raised the issue of the existence of non-symmetric manifolds with holonomy Sp(&quot;n&quot;)·Sp(1).Interesting results were proved in the mid-1960s in pioneering work by Edmond Bonan and Kraines who have independently proven that any such manifold admits a parallel 4-form formula_5.The long awaited analog of strong Lefschetz theorem was published in 1982 : formula_6

==Equivalent definition in terms of holonomy==

Equivalently, a hyperkähler manifold is a Riemannian manifold formula_1 of dimension formula_8 whose holonomy group is contained in the compact symplectic group.

Indeed, if formula_9 is a hyperkähler manifold, then the tangent space is a quaternionic vector space for each point of , i.e. it is isomorphic to formula_10 for some integer formula_11, where formula_12 is the algebra of quaternions. The compact symplectic group can be considered as the group of orthogonal transformations of formula_10 which are linear with respect to , and . From this, it follows that the holonomy group of the Riemannian manifold formula_1 is contained in . Conversely, if the holonomy group of a Riemannian manifold formula_1 of dimension formula_8 is contained in , choose complex structures , and on which make into a quaternionic vector space. Parallel transport of these complex structures gives the required complex structures formula_2 on making formula_9 into a hyperkähler manifold.

==Two-sphere of complex structures==
Every hyperkähler manifold formula_9 has a 2-sphere of complex structures with respect to which the metric formula_3 is Kähler. Indeed, for any real numbers formula_21 such that

:formula_22

the linear combination

:formula_23

is a complex structures that is Kähler with respect to formula_3. If formula_25 denotes the Kähler forms of formula_26, respectively, then the Kähler form of formula_27 is
:formula_28

==Holomorphic symplectic form==
A hyperkähler manifold formula_9, considered as a complex manifold formula_30, is holomorphically symplectic (equipped with a holomorphic, non-degenerate, closed 2-form). More precisely, if formula_25 denotes the Kähler forms of formula_26, respectively, then

:formula_33

is holomorphic symplectic with respect to formula_34.

Conversely, Shing-Tung Yau&#x27;s proof of the Calabi conjecture implies that a compact, Kähler, holomorphically symplectic manifold formula_35 is always equipped with a compatible hyperkähler metric. Such a metric is unique in a given Kähler class. Compact hyperkähler manifolds have been extensively studied using techniques from algebraic geometry, sometimes under the name &quot;holomorphically symplectic manifolds&quot;. The holonomy group of any Calabi–Yau metric on a simply connected compact holomorphically symplectic manifold of complex dimension formula_36 with formula_37 is exactly ; and if the simply connected Calabi–Yau manifold instead has formula_38, it is just the Riemannian product of lower-dimensional hyperkähler manifolds. This fact immediately follows from the Bochner formula for holomorphic forms on a Kähler manifold, together the Berger classification of holonomy groups; ironically, it is often attributed to Bogomolov, who incorrectly went on to claim in the same paper that compact hyperkähler manifolds actually do not exist!

==Examples==
For any integer formula_39, the space formula_10 of formula_11-tuples of quaternions endowed with the flat Euclidean metric is a hyperkähler manifold. The first non-trivial example discovered is the Eguchi–Hanson metric on the cotangent bundle formula_42 of the two-sphere. It was also independently discovered by Eugenio Calabi, who showed the more general statement that cotangent bundle formula_43 of any complex projective space has a complete hyperkähler metric. More generally, Birte Feix and Dmitry Kaledin showed that the cotangent bundle of any Kähler manifold has a hyperkähler structure on a neighbourhood of its zero section, although it is generally incomplete.

Due to Kunihiko Kodaira&#x27;s classification of complex surfaces, we know that any compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is either a K3 surface or a compact torus formula_44. (Every Calabi–Yau manifold in 4 (real) dimensions is a hyperkähler manifold, because is isomorphic to .)

As was discovered by Beauville, the Hilbert scheme of points on a compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is a hyperkähler manifold of dimension . This gives rise to two series of compact examples: Hilbert schemes of points on a K3 surface and generalized Kummer varieties.

Non-compact, complete, hyperkähler 4-manifolds which are asymptotic to , where denotes the quaternions and is a finite subgroup of , are known as asymptotically locally Euclidean, or ALE, spaces. These spaces, and various generalizations involving different asymptotic behaviors, are studied in physics under the name gravitational instantons. The Gibbons–Hawking ansatz gives examples invariant under a circle action.

Many examples of noncompact hyperkähler manifolds arise as moduli spaces of solutions to certain gauge theory equations which arise from the dimensional reduction of the anti-self dual Yang–Mills equations: instanton moduli spaces, monopole moduli spaces, spaces of solutions to Nigel Hitchin&#x27;s self-duality equations on Riemann surfaces, space of solutions to Nahm equations. Another class of examples are the Nakajima quiver varieties, which are of great importance in representation theory.

==Cohomology==
 show that the cohomology of any compact hyperkähler manifold embeds into the cohomology of a torus, in a way that preserves the Hodge structure.

<doc id="646122" wikidata="Q1858592" url="?curid=646122" title="Anthony Ainley">
<text>Anthony Ainley (20 August 1932 – 3 May 2004) was a British actor. He was the fourth actor to portray the Master in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Early life==
Ainley was born in Stanmore, Middlesex, the son of the actor Henry Ainley, on 20 August 1932, although his birth was not registered until January 1938 at around the time that he was admitted to the actors&#x27; orphanage. The birth certificates of Anthony and his brother Timothy identify their mother as Clarice Holmes and it is under this surname that they are recorded in the Official Register. Although no father is named on the birth certificates, Timothy&#x27;s marriage certificate identifies Henry Ainley as his father.

Under the name of Anthony Holmes, Ainley attended Cranleigh School from 1947 to 1950. His first job was as an insurance clerk, which was followed by a period at RADA. He won the Fabia Drake Prize for Comedy whilst at RADA. His half-brother, Richard Ainley, was also an actor.

==Career==
Ainley&#x27;s swarthy appearance tended to get him parts as villains, though an early regular role on British television was as Det. Sgt Hunter, sidekick to William Mervyn&#x27;s Chief Inspector Rose in the second series of &quot;It&#x27;s Dark Outside&quot; in 1966. Other notable roles include a subaltern in the 1969 film version of &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot;, Dietz in the 1974 film version of &quot;The Land That Time Forgot&quot;, Reverend Fallowfield in the Tigon film &quot;The Blood on Satan&#x27;s Claw&quot; (1971), Henry Sidney in &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (1971), Clive Hawksworth in &quot;Spyder&#x27;s Web&quot; (1972), Rev. Emilius in the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Pallisers&quot; (1974), Johnson in the first episode of the BBC programme &quot;Secret Army&quot; (1977), and Sunley in &quot;The Avengers&quot; episode &quot;Noon Doomsday&quot; (1968). He was also one of the Hong Kong policemen who discover James Bond&#x27;s supposed corpse in the opening sequence of &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967). Ainley played the role of the wealthy young peer Lord Charles Gilmour in the LWT series &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; (1973).

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Reportedly, it was his performance as Rev. Emilius (in &quot;The Pallisers&quot;) that led to him being offered the role of the Master by John Nathan-Turner, who had worked on &quot;The Pallisers&quot; seven years before becoming producer of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Ainley first portrayed Nyssa&#x27;s father Tremas in the 1981 serial &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot;, which led to him becoming a new embodiment of The Master. From then on, he appeared in most seasons up until the cancellation of the original series in 1989, including its final serial, &quot;Survival&quot;.

Ainley&#x27;s incarnation of The Master spanned four different incarnations of the Doctor. His appearances included the following serials:
&quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot; (1981),
&quot;Logopolis&quot; (1981),
&quot;Castrovalva&quot; (1982),
&quot;Time Flight&quot; (1982),
&quot;The King&#x27;s Demons&quot; (1983),
&quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983),
&quot;Planet of Fire&quot; (1984),
&quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot; (1985),
&quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot; (1986)
and &quot;Survival&quot; (1989).

He later reprised the role for the 1997 BBC computer game &quot;Destiny of the Doctors&quot;.

Ainley&#x27;s great love of the role is often cited in documentaries and DVD commentaries. Script editor Eric Saward claimed that he introduced himself over the phone by saying &quot;This is the Master&quot; and then would laugh. In the commentary and documentary for &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;, both Colin Baker and Kate O&#x27;Mara say that &quot;He only ever wanted to play the Master.&quot; Baker remarked that he could afford this luxury because he had built up a private income by the mid-1980s and had inherited a considerable sum of money from his father. In &quot;Cat Flap: Making of Survival&quot;, Sylvester McCoy confirms that all he ever wanted to be is the Master, and he kept his role active, even when not on set. &quot;He was as scary off camera as he was on it.&quot;

==Personal life==
Ainley remained unmarried throughout his life. He joked on the DVD commentary for &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot; (which was recorded shortly before his death) that he did not like the three rings of marriage: the engagement ring, the wedding ring and the bickering.

Ainley was a keen sportsman. Initially he was a rugby player, he played at fly-half for the Old Cranleighans, Richmond and Middlesex. Later he turned his attentions to cricket, citing Sophie Aldred (who played Ace) as his friend once he learned that she played the game. He appeared on many occasions for the Stage and London Theatres C.C. mainly as an opening batsman.

==Death==
Ainley died in Harrow, London, on 3 May 2004, at the age of 71. He was known to be reclusive, remaining out of the public eye for most of his life after &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was put on hiatus in 1989.

==Biography==
In 2015, Fantom Publishing published the biography of Anthony Ainley - The Man Behind the Master by Karen Louise Hollis. This came out in hardback, followed by paperback and audiobook.

<doc id="646125" wikidata="Q339051" url="?curid=646125" title="Heterosis">
<text>Heterosis, hybrid vigor, or outbreeding enhancement is the improved or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring. An offspring is heterotic if its traits are enhanced as a result of mixing the genetic contributions of its parents. The heterotic offspring often has traits that are more than the simple addition of the parents&#x27; traits, and can be explained by Mendelian or non-Mendelian inheritance. Typical heterotic/hybrid traits of interest in agriculture are higher yield, quicker maturity, stability, drought tolerance etc.

== Definitions ==
In proposing the term heterosis to replace the older term heterozygosis, G.H. Shull aimed to avoid limiting the term to the effects that can be explained by heterozygosity in Mendelian inheritance.
Heterosis is often discussed as the opposite of inbreeding depression, although differences in these two concepts can be seen in evolutionary considerations such as the role of genetic variation or the effects of genetic drift in small populations on these concepts. Inbreeding depression occurs when related parents have children with traits that negatively influence their fitness largely due to homozygosity. In such instances, outcrossing should result in heterosis.

Not all outcrosses result in heterosis. For example, when a hybrid inherits traits from its parents that are not fully compatible, fitness can be reduced. This is a form of outbreeding depression, the effects of which are similar to inbreeding depression.

== Genetic and epigenetic bases ==

Since the early 1900s, two competing genetic hypotheses, not necessarily mutually exclusive, have been developed to explain hybrid vigor. More recently, an epigenetic component of hybrid vigor has also been established.

=== Dominance and overdominance ===

When a population is small or inbred, it tends to lose genetic diversity. Inbreeding depression is the loss of fitness due to loss of genetic diversity. Inbred strains tend to be homozygous for recessive alleles that are mildly harmful (or produce a trait that is undesirable from the standpoint of the breeder). Heterosis or hybrid vigor, on the other hand, is the tendency of outbred strains to exceed both inbred parents in fitness.

Selective breeding of plants and animals, including hybridization, began long before there was an understanding of underlying scientific principles. In the early 20th century, after Mendel&#x27;s laws came to be understood and accepted, geneticists undertook to explain the superior vigor of many plant hybrids. Two competing hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, were developed:

* Dominance hypothesis. The dominance hypothesis attributes the superiority of hybrids to the suppression of undesirable recessive alleles from one parent by dominant alleles from the other. It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to loss of genetic diversity, with the strains becoming purely homozygous at many loci. The dominance hypothesis was first expressed in 1908 by the geneticist Charles Davenport. Under the dominance hypothesis, deleterious alleles are expected to be maintained in a random-mating population at a selection–mutation balance that would depend on the rate of mutation, the effect of the alleles and the degree to which alleles are expressed in heterozygotes.
* Overdominance hypothesis. Certain combinations of alleles that can be obtained by crossing two inbred strains are advantageous in the heterozygote. The overdominance hypothesis attributes the heterozygote advantage to the survival of many alleles that are recessive and harmful in homozygotes. It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to a high percentage of these harmful recessives. The overdominance hypothesis was developed independently by Edward M. East (1908) and George Shull (1908). Genetic variation at an overdominant locus is expected to be maintained by balancing selection. The high fitness of heterozygous genotypes favours the persistence of an allelic polymorphism in the population. This hypothesis is commonly invoked to explain the persistence of some alleles (most famously the Sickle cell trait allele) that are harmful in homozygotes. In normal circumstances, such harmful alleles would be removed from a population through the process of natural selection. Like the dominance hypothesis, it attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to expression of such harmful recessive alleles.

Dominance and overdominance have different consequences for the gene expression profile of the individuals. If overdominance is the main cause for the fitness advantages of heterosis, then there should be an over-expression of certain genes in the heterozygous offspring compared to the homozygous parents. On the other hand, if dominance is the cause, fewer genes should be under-expressed in the heterozygous offspring compared to the parents. Furthermore, for any given gene, the expression should be comparable to the one observed in the fitter of the two parents. In any case, outcross matings provide the benefit of masking deleterious recessive alleles in progeny. This benefit has been proposed to be a major factor in the maintenance of sexual reproduction among eukaryotes, as summarized in the article Evolution of sexual reproduction.

====Historical retrospective====
Which of the two mechanisms are the &quot;main&quot; reason for heterosis has been a scientific controversy in the field of genetics. Population geneticist James Crow (1916–2012) believed, in his younger days, that overdominance was a major contributor to hybrid vigor. In 1998 he published a retrospective review of the developing science. According to Crow, the demonstration of several cases of heterozygote advantage in &quot;Drosophila&quot; and other organisms first caused great enthusiasm for the overdominance theory among scientists studying plant hybridization. But overdominance implies that yields on an inbred strain should decrease as inbred strains are selected for the performance of their hybrid crosses, as the proportion of harmful recessives in the inbred population rises. Over the years, experimentation in plant genetics has proven that the reverse occurs, that yields increase in both the inbred strains and the hybrids, suggesting that dominance alone may be adequate to explain the superior yield of hybrids. Only a few conclusive cases of overdominance have been reported in all of genetics. Since the 1980s, as experimental evidence has mounted, the dominance theory has made a comeback.

Crow wrote:

The current view ... is that the dominance hypothesis is the major explanation of inbreeding decline and [of] the high yield of hybrids. There is little statistical evidence for contributions from overdominance and epistasis. But whether the best hybrids are getting an extra boost from overdominance or favorable epistatic contributions remains an open question.

=== Epigenetics ===

An epigenetic contribution to heterosis has been established in plants, and it has also been reported in animals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), discovered in 1993, are a class of non-coding small RNAs which repress the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or cause degradation of mRNAs. In hybrid plants, most miRNAs have non-additive expression (it might be higher or lower than the levels in the parents). This suggests that the small RNAs are involved in the growth, vigor and adaptation of hybrids.

&#x27;Heterosis without hybridity&#x27; effects on plant size have been demonstrated in genetically isogenic F1 triploid (autopolyploid) plants, where paternal genome excess F1 triploids display positive heterosis, whereas maternal genome excess F1s display negative heterosis effects. Such findings demonstrate that heterosis effects, with a genome dosage-dependent epigenetic basis, can be generated in F1 offspring that are genetically isogenic (i.e. harbour no heterozygosity). It has been shown that hybrid vigor in an allopolyploid hybrid of two &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; species was due to epigenetic control in the upstream regions of two genes, which caused major downstream alteration in chlorophyll and starch accumulation. The mechanism involves acetylation or methylation of specific amino acids in histone H3, a protein closely associated with DNA, which can either activate or repress associated genes.

== Specific mechanisms ==
=== Major histocompatibility complex in animals ===
One example of where particular genes may be important in vertebrate animals for heterosis is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Vertebrates inherit several copies of both MHC class I and MHC class II from each parent, which are used in antigen presentation as part of the adaptive immune system. Each different copy of the genes is able to bind and present a different set of potential peptides to T-lymphocytes. These genes are highly polymorphic throughout populations, but are more similar in smaller, more closely related populations. Breeding between more genetically distant individuals decreases the chance of inheriting two alleles that are the same or similar, allowing a more diverse range of peptides to be presented. This, therefore, increases the chance that any particular pathogen will be recognised, and means that more antigenic proteins on any pathogen are likely to be recognised, giving a greater range of T-cell activation, so a greater response. This also means that the immunity acquired to the pathogen is against a greater range of antigens, meaning that the pathogen must mutate more before immunity is lost. Thus, hybrids are less likely to succumb to pathogenic disease and are more capable of fighting off infection. This may be the cause, though, of autoimmune diseases.

== Plants ==
Crosses between inbreds from different heterotic groups result in vigorous F1 hybrids with significantly more heterosis than F1 hybrids from inbreds within the same heterotic group or pattern. Heterotic groups are created by plant breeders to classify inbred lines, and can be progressively improved by reciprocal recurrent selection.

Heterosis is used to increase yields, uniformity, and vigor. Hybrid breeding methods are used in maize, sorghum, rice, sugar beet, onion, spinach, sunflowers, broccoli and to create a more psychoactive cannabis.

=== Corn (maize) ===
Nearly all field corn (maize) grown in most developed nations exhibits heterosis. Modern corn hybrids substantially outyield conventional cultivars and respond better to fertilizer.

Corn heterosis was famously demonstrated in the early 20th century by George H. Shull and Edward M. East after hybrid corn was invented by Dr. William James Beal of Michigan State University based on work begun in 1879 at the urging of Charles Darwin. Dr. Beal&#x27;s work led to the first published account of a field experiment demonstrating hybrid vigor in corn, by Eugene Davenport and Perry Holden, 1881. These various pioneers of botany and related fields showed that crosses of inbred lines made from a Southern dent and a Northern flint, respectively, showed substantial heterosis and outyielded conventional cultivars of that era. However, at that time such hybrids could not be economically made on a large scale for use by farmers. Donald F. Jones at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, New Haven invented the first practical method of producing a high-yielding hybrid maize in 1914–1917. Jones&#x27; method produced a double-cross hybrid, which requires two crossing steps working from four distinct original inbred lines. Later work by corn breeders produced inbred lines with sufficient vigor for practical production of a commercial hybrid in a single step, the single-cross hybrids. Single-cross hybrids are made from just two original parent inbreds. They are generally more vigorous and also more uniform than the earlier double-cross hybrids. The process of creating these hybrids often involves detasseling.

Temperate maize hybrids are derived from two main heterotic groups: &#x27;Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic&#x27;, and nonstiff stalk.

=== Rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot;) ===

Hybrid rice sees cultivation in many countries, including China, India, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Compared to inbred lines, hybrids produce approximately 20% greater yield, and comprise 45% of rice planting area in China. Rice production has seen enormous rise in China due to heavy uses of hybrid rice. In China, efforts have generated a super hybrid rice strain (&#x27;LYP9&#x27;) with a production capability around 15 tons per hectare. In India also, several varieties have shown high vigor, including &#x27;RH-10&#x27; and &#x27;Suruchi 5401&#x27;.

Since rice is a self-pollinating species, it requires the use of male-sterile lines to generate hybrids from separate lineages. The most common way of achieving this is using lines with genetic male-sterility, as manual emasculation is not optimal for large-scale hybridization. The first generation of hybrid rice was developed in the 1970s. It relies on three lines: a cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line, a maintainer line, and a restorer line. The second generation was widely adopted in the 1990s. Instead of a CMS line, it uses an environment-sensitive genic male sterile line (EGMS), which can have its sterility reversed based on light or temperature. This removes the need for a maintainer, making the hybridization and breeding process more efficient (albeit still high-maintenance). Second generation lines show a yield increase of 5-10% over first generation lines. The third and current generation uses a nuclear male sterile line (NMS). Third generation lines have a recessive sterility gene, and their cultivation is more lenient towards maintainer lines and environmental conditions. Additionally, transgenes are only present in the maintainer, so hybrid plants can benefit from hybrid vigor without requiring special oversight.

== Animals ==
=== Hybrid livestock ===
The concept of heterosis is also applied in the production of commercial livestock. In cattle, crosses between Black Angus and Hereford produce a cross known as a &quot;Black Baldy&quot;. In swine, &quot;blue butts&quot; are produced by the cross of Hampshire and Yorkshire. Other, more exotic hybrids (two different species, so genetically more dissimilar), such as &quot;beefalo&quot; which are hybrids of cattle and bison, are also used for specialty markets.

==== Poultry ====
Within poultry, sex-linked genes have been used to create hybrids in which males and females can be sorted at one day old by color. Specific genes used for this are genes for barring and wing feather growth. Crosses of this sort create what are sold as Black Sex-links, Red Sex-links, and various other crosses that are known by trade names.

Commercial broilers are produced by crossing different strains of White Rocks and White Cornish, the Cornish providing a large frame and the Rocks providing the fast rate of gain. The hybrid vigor produced allows the production of uniform birds at a marketable carcass weight at 6–9 weeks of age.

Likewise, hybrids between different strains of White Leghorn are used to produce laying flocks that provide the majority of white eggs for sale in the United States.

=== Dogs ===
In 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds.

John Scott and John L. Fuller performed a detailed study of purebred Cocker Spaniels, purebred Basenjis, and hybrids between them.
They found that hybrids ran faster than either parent, perhaps due to heterosis. Other characteristics, such as basal heart rate, did not show any heterosis—the dog&#x27;s basal heart rate was close to the average of its parents—perhaps due to the additive effects of multiple genes.

Sometimes people working on a dog-breeding program find no useful heterosis.

All this said, studies do not provide definitive proof of hybrid vigor in dogs. This is largely due to the unknown heritage of most mixed breed dogs used. Results vary wildly, with some studies showing benefit and others finding the mixed breed dogs to be more prone to genetic conditions.

===Birds===
In 2014, a study undertaken by the Centre for Integrative Ecology at Deakin University in Geelong, Victoria, concluded that intrasubspecific hybrids between the subspecies &quot;Platycercus elegans flaveolus&quot; and &quot;P. e. elegans&quot; of the crimson rosella (&quot;P. elegans&quot;) were more likely to fight off diseases than their pure counterparts.

=== Humans ===
Human beings are all extremely genetically similar to one another. Michael Mingroni has proposed heterosis, in the form of hybrid vigor associated with historical reductions of the levels of inbreeding, as an explanation of the Flynn effect, the steady rise in IQ test scores around the world during the 20th century, though a review of nine studies found that there is no evidence to suggest inbreeding has an effect on IQ.

== Controversy ==
The term heterosis often causes confusion and even controversy, particularly in selective breeding of domestic animals, because it is sometimes (incorrectly) claimed that all crossbred plants and animals are &quot;genetically superior&quot; to their parents, due to heterosis. but two problems exist with this claim:
# according to an article published in the journal &quot;Genome Biology&quot;, &quot;genetic superiority&quot; is an ill-defined term and not generally accepted terminology within the scientific field of genetics. A related term fitness is well defined, but it can rarely be directly measured. Instead, scientists use objective, measurable quantities, such as the number of seeds a plant produces, the germination rate of a seed, or the percentage of organisms that survive to reproductive age. From this perspective, crossbred plants and animals exhibiting heterosis may have &quot;superior&quot; traits, but this does not necessarily equate to any evidence of outright &quot;genetic superiority&quot;. Use of the term &quot;superiority&quot; is commonplace for example in crop breeding, where it is well understood to mean a better-yielding, more robust plant for agriculture. Such a plant may yield better on a farm, but would likely struggle to survive in the wild, making this use open to misinterpretation. In human genetics any question of &quot;genetic superiority&quot; is even more problematic due to the historical and political implications of any such claim. Some may even go as far as to describe it as a questionable value judgement in the realm of politics, not science.
# not all hybrids exhibit heterosis (see outbreeding depression).

An example of the ambiguous value judgements imposed on hybrids and hybrid vigor is the mule. While mules are almost always infertile, they are valued for a combination of hardiness and temperament that is different from either of their horse or donkey parents. While these qualities may make them &quot;superior&quot; for particular uses by humans, the infertility issue implies that these animals would most likely become extinct without the intervention of humans through animal husbandry, making them &quot;inferior&quot; in terms of natural selection.

<text>The Battle of Chotusitz, or Chotusice, sometimes called the Battle of [[Čáslav]], took place on 17 May 1742, in Bohemia, now the Czech Republic; it was part of the 1740 to 1742 First Silesian War, itself a subsidiary of the wider War of the Austrian Succession.

Led by Charles of Lorraine, an Imperial force of around 25,000 men was advancing against French-occupied Prague, when it ran into a Prussian army of roughly equal size, commanded by Frederick the Great. Casualties were heavy on both sides, and the battle had little impact on the war in general, but is considered a Prussian victory as they retained possession of the battlefield.

The First Silesian War ended with the Treaty of Breslau in June 1742, allowing Austria to recapture Prague in December. Hostilities resumed in 1744 with the outbreak of the Second Silesian War.

== Background ==
The War of the Austrian Succession was sparked by the death of Charles VI in 1740 and the succession of his daughter Maria Theresa. Salic law previously excluded women from inheriting the Habsburg monarchy; the 1713 Pragmatic Sanction set this aside, allowing Maria Theresa to succeed her father.

Austria&#x27;s position as the most powerful element in the Holy Roman Empire was threatened by the growth of Bavaria, Prussia and Saxony, who disputed the validity of the Sanction. With French support, they invaded the Crown of Bohemia, then the most important industrial area in Europe, comprising Silesia, Moravia and Bohemia. Frederick II occupied Silesia; the richest individual province in the Empire, responsible for 10% of total Imperial income, this was a serious blow to Austria.

Victory at Mollwitz in April 1741 consolidated Frederick&#x27;s hold on Silesia, while a French-Bavarian force captured Prague in November. Charles of Bavaria was crowned King of Bohemia, and on 12 February 1742, he became the first non-Habsburg Emperor since 1437. However, in a rare example of an Austrian winter offensive, by the end of February 1742, von Khevenhüller occupied much of Bavaria, including Munich, and most of Bohemia. 

The Austrians also employed guerilla warfare, using irregular troops or Pandurs to attack lines of communication. They inflicted considerable damage on Prussian troops and morale, one officer writing &#x27;these thieves and robbers...never show themselves in battle, like proper brave soldiers.&#x27; In response, Frederick moved into Moravia in March; he established himself at Židlochovice, which allowed him to threaten Vienna, and devastate the countryside.

By stripping garrisons from the rest of Bohemia, the Austrians assembled a field army of 28,000 to retake Prague, under Charles of Lorraine, who had a reputation as a cautious, timid and defensively minded general. Frederick took the offensive, and moved into North-East Bohemia; by 16 May, he had 10,000 infantry at Kutná Hora, with 18,000 men under Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau a day&#x27;s march behind.

Charles was thought to be some distance away, but in the afternoon of 16 May, his cavalry ran into Leopold&#x27;s rearguard. Recognising he was in contact with the Austrian main force, Leopold accelerated his march to close the gap with Frederick. At 2:00 am on 17 May, his exhausted troops stopped at the small village of Chotusice, three hours march from Kutná Hora.

==Battle==

Instructed to hold until Frederick reached him, Leopold deployed south of Chotusice, his infantry facing south-east, with cavalry on either flank. The left was commanded by Waldow, the right by the 70 year old veteran von Buddenbrock, Leopold leaving room for Frederick&#x27;s infantry to deploy when they arrived. Charles of Lorraine hoped to attack before Frederick could reach him but was not ready to do so until 7:00 am; as he advanced north from Čáslav, his army drifted slightly to the right, allowing Buddenbrock&#x27;s cavalry to outflank them.

Frederick arrived on the field at 8:00 am; to provide time to organise the infantry, he ordered the Prussian cavalry to charge, supported by field artillery. They drove the Austrian cavalry back, but the day was hot and dry, raising a huge cloud of dust and effectively blinding them. In the confusion, some units attacked in the wrong direction, allowing Karl Josef Batthyány and Liechtenstein to rally their men. Both sets of cavalry began looting each other&#x27;s baggage trains, an act of collective indiscipline that rendered them useless for much of the battle.

The Austrian artillery had been bombarding Chotusice, around 9:00 am, Daun&#x27;s infantry stormed the town, slowly driving Leopold&#x27;s forces from house to house. As they did so, they set it on fire, the smoke adding to the confusion caused by the dust, and making exercising command almost impossible. By 10:30, Frederick&#x27;s fresh infantry were deployed in a great square of 24 battalions; wheeling left, they fired into the Austrian infantry outside Chotusice. His flanks exposed by the cavalry&#x27;s disappearance, Charles decided to settle for a draw. He ordered a general retreat through Čáslav, leaving some of his heavy guns behind; Liechtenstein&#x27;s cavalry held off the Prussians, and by noon, combat had ceased.
==Aftermath==

The battle left the basic strategic situation unchanged; Charles was still able to move against Prague, while the Prussian presence in Moravia remained a threat to Vienna. Habsburg policy was generally to avoid fighting on too many fronts at the same time; although Prussia was the most dangerous, but also the most difficult to defeat. Although recovering Silesia remained a Habsburg priority for decades, Maria Theresa was willing to agree a temporary truce with Prussia to improve her position elsewhere.

This suited Frederick, who was short of money and men and also suspected France was preparing a separate peace. In June, the Treaty of Breslau ended the First Silesian War; Prussian troops withdrew from Bohemia, and Austria recaptured Prague in December.
Like other contemporaries, such as Maurice de Saxe, Frederick concluded morale was more effective in destroying enemy formations than firepower. At Mollwitz, the Austrians fled when faced with the steady, disciplined advance of the Prussian infantry; at Chotusice, it convinced Charles of Lorraine to settle for a draw. When the Second Silesian War began in 1744, Frederick told his officers the infantry had to do only two things; form up quickly, then maintain their formation.

The battle also showed the Prussian cavalry still needed work, particularly in horsemanship; a contributory factor to their apparent indiscipline was the inability of many to control their mounts and this became an area of focus after 1743. Von Gessler, who led Buddenbrock&#x27;s charge, was promoted lieutenant general, and received the Order of the Black Eagle; at Hohenfriedberg in 1745, he commanded the cavalry charge claimed as a key factor in Prussian victory.

<doc id="646127" wikidata="Q2377229" url="?curid=646127" title="Test Match Special">
<text>Test Match Special (also known as TMS) is a British sports radio programme, originally, as its name implies, dealing exclusively with Test cricket matches, but currently covering any professional cricket. The programme is available on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra (digital) and on BBC Sounds to the United Kingdom and (where broadcasting rights permit) the rest of the world. TMS provides ball-by-ball coverage of most Test cricket, One Day International, and Twenty20 matches and tournaments involving the England cricket team.

==History==
BBC Radio was the first broadcaster to cover every ball of a Test match. Live cricket had been broadcast since 1927, but originally it was thought that Test match cricket was too slow for ball-by-ball commentary to work. However, Seymour de Lotbiniere, who was responsible for live sports coverage and who went on to become head of outside broadcasts at the BBC, realised that ball-by-ball commentary could make compelling radio. In the mid-1930s he got Howard Marshall to begin commentating on cricket, rather than only giving reports. From the mid-1930s to the 1950s the amount of ball-by-ball commentary gradually increased, but it was not until &quot;TMS&quot; was launched in 1957 that every ball was covered for their British audience.

Robert Hudson was responsible for the launch of &quot;TMS&quot;, writing to his Outside Broadcasts boss Charles Max-Muller in 1956, proposing broadcasting full ball-by-ball coverage of Tests rather than only covering fixed periods, and suggesting using the BBC Third Programme (later to become BBC Radio 3) frequencies, since at that time the Third Programme only broadcast in the evening.

&quot;TMS&quot; became a fixture on Radio 3&#x27;s medium wave frequencies until Radio 3 lost them in February 1992. The programme moved to Radio 3 FM that summer and the following summer the morning session was broadcast on Radio 5, switching to Radio 3 for the afternoon session. The launch of Radio 5 Live in 1994 saw &quot;TMS&quot; move to Radio 4 long wave (198 LW, plus various localised MW frequencies including 720 MW in London and 603 MW in the north east). However, coverage on long wave ended at the conclusion of the 2023 season. 

2002 saw the launch of Radio 5 Sports Extra (then known as BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra), and Digital radio was seen as the solution for &quot;where to put&quot; &quot;TMS&quot;, and as a way for cricket fans to avoid broadcasts of the Shipping Forecast, &quot;The Daily Service&quot; and &quot;Yesterday in Parliament&quot; which would otherwise interrupt the cricket on long wave. 

From 1973 to 2007, &quot;Test Match Special&quot; was produced by Peter Baxter. Halfway through 2007, Baxter retired and was replaced by Adam Mountford, previously the Five Live cricket producer. Mountford was aged just one when Peter Baxter became involved with &quot;TMS&quot;.

Full commentaries are now available for thirty days on BBC Sounds, and since late-2015 a &quot;live-rewind&quot; feature has been available.

Format changes include the addition of daily live weather forecasts and reports on the domestic county championship for home series, plus an end of day summary with Jonathan Agnew and Geoffrey Boycott. After Boycott left &quot;Test Match Special&quot; in 2020, Agnew now conducts the end of day summary alongside Michael Vaughan. 

Calypso-tinged theme music from the track &quot;Soul Limbo&quot; by the American soul band Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s is played at the beginning and end of &quot;TMS&quot; coverage each day. 

In December 2008 the BBC won the UK radio rights up to 2013. On 26 January 2012 the ECB announced a further six-year deal covering home Tests until the 2019 Ashes. In 2017 the ECB agreed a new deal with the BBC to cover England cricket on radio from 2020 to 2024 alongside the new rights for BBC TV coverage of live Twenty20 Cricket and Test match and ODI International highlights.

In September 2021, Melissa Story became the youngest ever commentator on &quot;TMS&quot;, an accolade previously held by Christopher Martin-Jenkins.

The BBC also covers winter series but has lost certain rights to talkSPORT over the years as broadcasting rights for tours are controlled by the host country and it is not uncommon for there to be disputes. In 2001, Agnew was forced to broadcast by mobile phone from the ramparts of Galle Fort, overlooking the Sri Lankan ground, when the BBC were locked out.

On 31 July 2023, TMS aired its final broadcast on BBC Radio 4 LW ahead of the planned closure of Radio 4&#x27;s long wave transmissions sometime in 2024.

==&quot;TMS&quot; commentators==
In a Test match three or four commentators and three or four summarisers are used in rotation; each commentator &quot;sits in&quot; before the microphone for twenty minutes, and each summariser for thirty minutes, at a time. Some of the commentators have nicknames (a few based on the first syllable of their surname, plus the syllable &quot;-ers&quot;). They have included: 
* E. W. Swanton (1938–1975)
* Rex Alston (1945–1964)

* Peter Cranmer (1965, 1968 – 2 matches only)
* Brian Johnston (&quot;Johnners&quot;) (1966–1993)
* Neil Durden-Smith (1969–1974)

===Regular summarisers===
The long-standing pattern of a broadcast was commentary during the over followed by a summary or other comments between overs (usually by retired first-class cricketers). In recent years, this pattern has changed, with comments being made not just between overs but between balls. 

Past summarisers have included:
* Norman Yardley (1956–1969, 1973)
* Freddie Brown (1957–1969)
* Trevor Bailey (&quot;Boil&quot;) (1974–1999)
* Fred Trueman (1974–1999)
* David Lloyd (&quot;Bumble&quot;) (1981–1991)
* Colin Milburn (1983–1988)
* Mike Selvey (1984–2008)
* Graeme Fowler (1994–2005)
* Angus Fraser (2002–2008)
* Graham Gooch (2002–2009)
* Geoffrey Boycott (2005–2020)
* Alec Stewart (2006–2019)
* Graeme Swann (&quot;Swanny&quot;) (2014–2019)

Current summarisers include:
* Vic Marks (&quot;The Vicar&quot;) (1990–)
* Phil Tufnell (&quot;Tuffers&quot;) (2003–)
* Michael Vaughan (&quot;Vaughnie&quot;) (2009–21, 2023–)
* Ebony Rainford-Brent (2015–)
* James Anderson (2018–)
* Steven Finn (2018–)
* Mark Ramprakash (2019–)
* Sir Alastair Cook (2019–)
* Alex Hartley (2020–)

===Guest commentators and summarisers===
In addition, visitors from overseas join the &quot;TMS&quot; team as commentators or summarisers when their country is touring England or vice versa. These have included: 

===Scorers===
The &quot;TMS&quot; team also includes a scorer. The first was Arthur Wrigley, followed in 1966 by Bill Frindall (affectionately known as &quot;the Bearded Wonder&quot;) whose final Test was England&#x27;s drawn second Test with India in December 2008. Jo King was used as scorer for overseas tours after Frindall stopped travelling. When Jo was unavailable for the 2006/07 Commonwealth Banks Series finals in Australia, Michael Robinson replaced her for the first final at the MCG. Malcolm Ashton (affectionately known as &quot;Ashtray&quot;) became TMS scorer following Frindall&#x27;s death in 2009. South African Andrew Samson was the scorer on overseas tours from the Ashes tour of 2010/11, and took over from Malcolm Ashton in 2014, for the home series against Sri Lanka and India. Andy Zaltzman became the scorer on the Sri Lankan tour of England in 2016. Having been the scorer on numerous England women&#x27;s matches, Phil Long made his debut on the programme at the start of the 2019 Cricket World Cup where he and Zaltzman were the scorers. 

* Arthur Wrigley (1934–1966)
* Bill Frindall (&quot;The Bearded Wonder&quot; or &quot;Bearders&quot;) (1966–2008)
* Jo King
* Michael Robinson
* Malcolm Ashton (&quot;Ashtray&quot;) (2009–2014)
* Andrew Samson (2010–2019)
* Andy Zaltzman (2016 to date)
* Phil Long (2019 to date)

===Producers and reporters===
The producer from 1973 to June 2007 was Peter Baxter, who was also himself a capable commentator. He succeeded Michael Tuke-Hastings, and on his retirement was succeeded by Adam Mountford.

==Light-hearted style==
&quot;TMS&quot; has always had a distinctively irreverent style. While it takes seriously its role of describing and commenting on the action, there is also much light relief. Brian Johnston, who was as happy on the stage and working in light entertainment presentation as he was in the commentary box, was the master of this style. This could on occasion lead to hilarity in the box, for instance on one occasion in August 1991 at The Oval when Ian Botham was dismissed &quot;hit wicket&quot; and Agnew said Botham &quot;just couldn&#x27;t quite get his leg over.&quot; This remark led both Agnew and Johnston to collapse in a fit of giggles, which was quickly followed by Johnston&#x27;s giggly chastening, &quot;Aggers, do stop it!&quot; This clip has become a broadcasting classic and is frequently replayed. In 2005, Radio 5 Live listeners voted it the greatest sporting commentary of all time, with ten times as many votes as &quot;they think it&#x27;s all over&quot;.

Other Johnners classics include, &quot;There&#x27;s Neil Harvey standing at leg-slip with his legs wide apart, waiting for a tickle&quot;, and &quot;...and Ward bowls to Glenn Turner, short, ooh! and it catches him high up on the, er, thigh. That really must have hurt as he&#x27;s doubled over in pain. I remember when...&quot; and after 2 minutes of typical Johnners fill, he continued, &quot;Well, he&#x27;s bravely going to carry on ... but he doesn&#x27;t look too good. One ball left.&quot;

Listeners&#x27; letters and emails are often read out on air. Brian Johnston was once taken to task by a schoolmistress correspondent, pretending indignation, for saying during a West Indies Test commentary: &quot;The bowler&#x27;s Holding, the batsman&#x27;s Willey.&quot; However, on this occasion he was innocent.

Concern about BBC Sport&#x27;s commitment to maintaining the tone and style of the programme after its 50th anniversary led to an Early Day Motion being tabled in Parliament by Andrew George MP in June 2007.

==Cakes==
Brian Johnston started the tradition of the public sending cakes to the commentary box. In Johnston&#x27;s day they were chocolate cakes, whereas now fruit cakes seem to be more popular. Indeed, in 2001 the Queen herself had a fruit cake baked for the &quot;TMS&quot; team. She said that it was baked &quot;under close supervision&quot; by her following Jonathan Agnew&#x27;s light-hearted questioning of her as to whether she might have baked it herself.

In 2019, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall commissioned a cake featuring the helmets and captains from the England vs. New Zealand teams, delivered and consumed during the World Cup Final.

==Beards==
Beards have become a recurring theme during &quot;TMS&quot; commentary, under the supervision of &quot;Bearders&quot; himself — scorer and statistician. The &quot;TMS&quot; team receive sporadic missives from Keith Flett, social historian, serial newspaper letter writer and chairman of the Beard Liberation Front, a group dedicated to the removal of a societal prejudice against the facially follically enhanced or bearded. Flett offers his opinions on the state of beards in the game today and his views are frequently discussed on TMS, particularly by Jonathan Agnew, including transformations in the recent and bygone Pakistan cricketers, and most recently with regards to the &quot;splendidly hirsute&quot; Monty Panesar. Bill Frindall was announced &quot;Beard of the Year&quot; winner in 2008.

==Charity==
There is a tradition that every Saturday of a home Test match the commentators wear a Primary Club tie. Membership of the Primary Club is available to anybody who has been out first ball (a &quot;golden duck&quot;) in any form of cricket. Proceeds are donated to a charity for blind and partially sighted cricketers.

==View from the Boundary==
This is a regular Saturday lunchtime feature during home Test matches, in which guests from all walks of life are interviewed about their love of cricket as well as their own sphere of activity. In the early years of the feature the interviewer was usually Brian Johnston; nowadays most interviews are conducted by Jonathan Agnew. Lily Allen has been interviewed twice and stated a preference for the longer Test form of the game during her first interview on View from the Boundary. Daniel Radcliffe was interviewed on his 18th birthday at the Lord&#x27;s Test in 2007 after being hunted down by Shilpa Patel, &quot;TMS&quot;&#x27;s assistant producer. During the Ashes Test in 2009 at Lord&#x27;s Patel also attracted the New Zealand actor Russell Crowe into the &quot;TMS&quot; box, while his cousin, the former Kiwi test cricketer Jeff Crowe, was serving as the match referee. Agnew remarked &quot;that we have been joined by the cousin of the match referee&quot; live on air. British prime ministers have been guests, including cricket fans John Major, David Cameron, who was interviewed twice, once as the Leader of Her Majesty&#x27;s Official Opposition, Theresa May, and Rishi Sunak.

== Lunchtime Features ==

In addition to View from the Boundary, &quot;TMS&quot; regularly provides features such as interviews with ex-players or reminiscences of matches and seasons gone by. In each case, the narrator tells the story interspersed with recorded interviews with the main protagonists as well as pieces of archive commentary. This [incomplete] list is as follows:

1988: Islands in the Sun: Similar to the Poms Down Under and again produced by Peter Baxter. These were broadcast on the first day of every test match of the 1988 England v West Indies test series. This programmes focused on the England (again MCC for many years) tours of the West Indies. It contained (but is not limited to) the tours of 1967–68, 1973–74, 1980–81 and 1985–86.

1989: The Poms Down Under – produced by Peter Baxter. A series of programmes broadcast at lunchtime on the first day of every test match during the 1989 Ashes series. Each programme chronicled an England (or MCC as it was for many years) tour of Australia. These tours included 1950–51, 1954–55, 1965–66, 1970–71, 1974–75, 1978–79 (including the short tour of 1979–80), 1982–83 and 1986–87.

1990: A passage to India: Chronicling the England (or MCC for many years) tours of India including 1972–73, 1976–77, 1981–82 and 1984–85.

Seasons to Savour: A series of programmes produced by Peter Baxter telling the highlights of various significant seasons. Presented by Peter Baxter, these included: 1971 and 1975. In each case, not just the internationals but the country (championship, NatWest and B&amp;H) seasons were covered.

More recent lunchtime features have tended to be more live with ex-players reuniting to share their memories with new TMS scorer Andy Zaltzman giving some statistical context. Ray Illingworth made some appearances on the programme during lunchbreaks often taking about past matches together with a synopsis of the state of play currently.

While some of the more recent lunchtime features have been made available (for a period at least) on the TMS website, many of the older recordings have been abridged. None have ever been made available for purchase except for 3 cassettes sold in the late 1980s and early 1990s:

* From Bradman to Botham: The story of the Ashes 1948–1981.
* England v West Indies: 1950–1976
* The Great Match: Various test matches.

==Brian Johnston Champagne Moment==
At the end of each test match, the commentators vote for their favourite special moment in the match, and the player involved wins a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne. Examples include a personal milestone for a player, such as a century or five-wicket haul, a dramatic celebration, or a spectacular piece of fielding, wicket or shot.

==Criticism==
In 2008 Mike Selvey was replaced as a &quot;TMS&quot; summariser as new producer Adam Mountford brought in Phil Tufnell and Michael Vaughan. Selvey then criticised what he described as a shift towards &quot;laddish&quot; commentators such as Arlo White and Mark Pougatch who have &quot;little knowledge of the game, especially of the cadences of Test Match cricket&quot;. This sentiment was echoed by some of his contemporaries.

<text>Neil Douglas Walter (born 1942) is a New Zealand diplomat, and a former Administrator of Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand. He served from February 1988 until 1990, and again from 1 March 2003 to 17 October 2006.

==Biography==
In his early career in the Foreign Service, Walter served in Thailand, New York, and Samoa. In 1981, Walter was posted to New Zealand&#x27;s Embassy in Paris, where he was the New Zealand Permanent Representative to UNESCO. In 1985, Walter became New Zealand&#x27;s deputy High Commissioner to London.

Walter was New Zealand&#x27;s Ambassador to Indonesia from 1990–1994, and served as New Zealand&#x27;s Ambassador to Japan from 1997–1999. In 1999, Walter became Secretary of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs, until his retirement from the diplomatic service in 2002. He was one of three people to address the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization, 10th Meeting, June 23, 2003.

Walter was the chairman of the Environmental Risk Management Authority until 2008 and the chair of NZ On Air until 2012. He also undertakes various reviews and assessments for the NZ Government. His 2009 report on the State Services Commission&#x27;s ambitious and ill-fated GSN information technology project led to the resignation of the Deputy State Services Commissioner and Government CIO Laurence Millar.

==Honours==
In the 2002 Queen&#x27;s Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, Walter was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

==Personal life==
He is married and has one son and two daughters. His son, Stephen Walter, is a lead negotiator on climate change for the New Zealand Ministry of Environment. His brother David Walter of Stratford is a former chairman of the Taranaki Regional Council and mayor of the Stratford District Council.

<text>Frank Francis Frisch (September 9, 1897—March 12, 1973), nicknamed &quot;the Fordham Flash&quot; or &quot;the Old Flash&quot;, was an American professional baseball second baseman and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Giants (1919–1926) and St. Louis Cardinals (1927–1937), and managed the Cardinals (1933–1938), Pittsburgh Pirates (1940–1946), and Chicago Cubs (1949–1951). He is a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum. He is tied with Yogi Berra for most World Series doubles at 10 and holds the record for the most World Series hits at 58 for a player who never played for the New York Yankees, exceeded only by Berra and Mickey Mantle.

==Early life==
Born in The Bronx, New York City, Frisch attended Fordham Preparatory School, graduating in 1916. He went on to Fordham University where he continued to star in four sports: baseball, football, basketball, and track. His speed earned him the nickname &quot;the Fordham Flash&quot;.

==New York Giants==

In 1919, Frisch left Fordham to sign with the New York Giants of the National League, moving directly to the majors without playing in the minor leagues. He made an immediate impact, finishing third in the NL in stolen bases and seventh in RBI in 1920, his first full season. Manager John McGraw was so impressed by Frisch that he soon named him team captain, advising him base-running and hitting. The Giants played Frisch at both third base and second base early in his career, but by 1923 he was installed as the team&#x27;s full-time second baseman.

Frisch batted over .300 in his last six seasons with New York. He was also an expert fielder and a skilled base-runner. In 1921, he led the National League with 48 steals, in 1923 in hits, and in 1924 in runs. With Frisch adding his fiery competitiveness to the team, the Giants won the World Series in 1921 and 1922, winning the NL pennant the following two seasons as well.

On September 10, 1924, Frisch went 6-for-7 in a 22–1 rout of the Boston Braves at the Polo Grounds.

Frisch is tied with Pablo Sandoval for the franchise post-season multi-hit games record of 15.

==St. Louis Cardinals==
After the 1926 season, Frisch was traded—with pitcher Jimmy Ring—to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for star Rogers Hornsby. After an August 1926 loss in which Frisch had missed a sign, costing the Giants a run, McGraw had loudly berated Frisch in front of the team; Frisch responded by leaving the team, and his previously close relationship with McGraw virtually ended.

On June 2, 1930, in the 7th inning of a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Frisch was spiked. The ailments he sustained sidelined him for several weeks, coming back for a game against those same Phillies on June 20.

Playing second base for the Cardinals, Frisch appeared in four more World Series (1928, 1930–31, 1934), bringing his career total to eight. He was the driving force of the &quot;Gashouse Gang&quot;, the nickname for the Cardinals clubs of the early 1930s, which were built around him to reflect his no-holds-barred approach. The Cardinals had won only one pennant before Frisch joined the team; the Giants would win the pennant only once in Frisch&#x27;s nine seasons as the Cards&#x27; regular second baseman.

Frisch played eleven seasons with the Cardinals. In 1931, he was voted the Most Valuable Player in the National League after batting .311 with 4 home runs, 82 RBI, and leading the League in stolen bases with 28. The 1931 Cardinals also triumphed in the World Series, defeating Connie Mack&#x27;s defending two-time champion Philadelphia Athletics in seven games.

Frisch became player-manager of the Cardinals in 1933 and was named to the NL&#x27;s first three All-Star teams from 1933 to 1935. In 1934, he managed the Cardinals to another seven-game World Series victory—this time over the Detroit Tigers.
Frisch finished his playing career in 1937. His career statistics totaled a .316 batting average, still the highest ever for a switch hitter, with 2,880 hits, 1532 runs, 466 doubles, 138 triples, 105 home runs, 728 walks, and 1,244 RBI over 2,311 games. He was difficult to strike out, fanning only 272 times in 9,112 at-bats, or once every 33.5 at-bats. He also stole 419 bases in his 19 MLB seasons. His hit total stood as the record for switch-hitters until Pete Rose surpassed it in 1977. Frisch also hit .300 for his career from both sides of the plate; the only other switch-hitter with more than 5,000 at-bats with this distinction is fellow Hall of Famer Chipper Jones.

Frankie Frisch was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947. After no players had been selected by the writers in the previous two years (the only elections since 1942), the rules were revised to limit eligibility to those players who had retired after 1921; Frisch was among the first four players to benefit from the more reasonable field of candidates.

After his retirement as an active player, Frisch continued to manage the Cardinals, but was never able to capture another pennant. Frisch also had managerial stints with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1940–46) and the Chicago Cubs (1949–51), but without the success he had in St. Louis. Frisch&#x27;s career ledger as a manager shows a 1,138–1,078 (.514) mark, including the pennant in 1934. He also spent the first two months of the 1949 season as a New York Giants&#x27; coach, working under his old double-play partner, Leo Durocher, before leaving June 14 to replace Charlie Grimm as manager of the Cubs.

==Post-baseball career and death==
Frisch also worked for several years as a baseball color commentator on radio and television. In 1939, he called games for the Boston Bees and the Boston Red Sox on the Colonial Network, a regional radio network serving five New England states. He also called Giants radio in 1947–48, then worked as a post-game host for the team&#x27;s telecasts in the 1950s. His broadcasting trademark was worrying about pitchers walking batters: &quot;Oh, those bases on balls!&quot; After a heart attack in September 1956 forced Frisch to curtail his activities, Phil Rizzuto (recently released by Yankees as a player) filled in for him on Giants post-game shows for the rest of the season. From 1959 to 1961, Frisch teamed with Jack Whitaker to form the backup crew for Saturday &quot;Game of the Week&quot; coverage on CBS.

A number of years after Frisch left the playing field as a manager, he became a member of the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Committee on Baseball Veterans, which is responsible for electing players to the Hall of Fame who had not been elected during their initial period of eligibility by the Baseball Writers; he later became chairman of the committee. In the years just prior to his death, a number of Frisch&#x27;s Giants and Cardinals teammates were elected to the Hall; some notable writers, chiefly among them Bill James, have criticized these selections—including Jesse Haines, Dave Bancroft, Chick Hafey, Rube Marquard, Ross Youngs and George Kelly—which include some of the most widely questioned honorees in the Hall&#x27;s history. Critics have pointed out that many of these selectees had accomplishments which were less outstanding than those of other players who were bypassed, and were only selected because of Frisch&#x27;s influence.

Frisch died in Wilmington, Delaware from injuries suffered from a car accident near Elkton, Maryland a month earlier. He was 75 years old. Frisch had been returning to Rhode Island from the meeting of the Veterans Committee in Florida when he lost control of his car. Frisch died in the same manner as other N.Y. Giant Hall of Famers Mel Ott (1958) and Carl Hubbell (1988). He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

During his lifetime, Frisch used 1898 as his year of birth, although other records (Social Security death index, Census records, World War I Draft registration, and passport application) indicate an 1897 birth.
In 1999, he ranked number 88 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Frisch among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

Frisch is mentioned in the poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:

Years later, Nash added a footnote to this stanza: &quot;p.s. Thanks to Durocher, now everything&#x27;s kosher.&quot;

For many years, he lived at 184 Fenimore Road in the Bonnie Crest neighborhood of New Rochelle, New York. He had two hounds named Flash and Patches who kept him company. Frisch eventually moved to Charlestown, Rhode Island, devoting himself mainly to his interests in gardening and classical music.

The Mosholu Baseball Field in Bedford Park, Bronx, was renamed to Frank Frisch Field in 1948.

<text>The Battle of Prestonpans, also known as the Battle of Gladsmuir, was fought on 21 September 1745, near Prestonpans, in East Lothian, the first significant engagement of the Jacobite rising of 1745.

Jacobite forces, led by the Stuart exile Charles Edward Stuart and George Murray, defeated a government army under Sir John Cope, whose inexperienced troops broke in the face of a Highland charge. The battle lasted less than thirty minutes, was a huge boost to Jacobite morale, and established the revolt as a serious threat to the British government.

==Background==
The War of the Austrian Succession meant that by early 1745, the bulk of British forces were committed in Flanders. Encouraged by French victory at Fontenoy in April 1745, Charles Edward Stuart sailed for Scotland in July, hoping to take advantage of the situation. When he landed at Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides on 23 July, most of those contacted advised him to return to France, but enough were eventually persuaded, notably Donald Cameron of Lochiel, whose tenants provided a large proportion of the Jacobite force. The rebellion was formally launched at Glenfinnan on 19 August.

Sir John Cope, government commander in Scotland, was a competent soldier with between 3,000 and 4,000 troops available, but many were inexperienced recruits. He was hampered by poor intelligence and advice, particularly from the Marquess of Tweeddale, the Secretary of State for Scotland, who consistently underestimated the severity of the revolt. Once Charles&#x27;s location was confirmed, Cope left his cavalry and artillery at Stirling under Thomas Fowke and marched on Corrieyairack Pass, the primary access point between the Western Highlands and the Lowlands. Control would allow Cope to block the route into Eastern Scotland, but he found the Highlanders already in possession and withdrew to Inverness on 26 August.

Jacobite objectives remained unclear until early September, when Cope learned they were using the military road network to advance on Edinburgh. Concluding that the only way to reach the city first was by sea, his troops were loaded onto ships at Aberdeen. They began disembarking at Dunbar on 17 September but once again, he was too late. Charles had entered the Scottish capital earlier that day although Edinburgh Castle remained in government hands.

==Battle==

Joined at Dunbar by Fowke and the cavalry, Cope was confident that he was strong enough to defeat a poorly-armed Jacobite army of less than 2,000. At the same time, Charles ordered his forces to move eastward from Edinburgh, and the two armies made contact on the afternoon of 20 September. Cope drew up his forces facing south, with a marshy area immediately in front, park walls protecting their right and cannon behind the embankment of the Tranent to Cockenzie Waggonway, which crossed the battlefield.

The court-martial set up in 1746 to review Cope&#x27;s conduct agreed that the ground was well chosen and that the disposition of his troops was appropriate. However, that was undermined by various factors, such as the poor quality of some senior officers, including James Gardiner, whose dragoons fled in panic from a small party of Highlanders in the so-called Coltbridge Canter of 16 September. In addition, much of Cope&#x27;s infantry lacked experience. Until May, Lascelles&#x27; Regiment had been employed in building a military road near Loch Lomond. Finally, his borrowed seamen gunners were so poorly trained that he sent a messenger to Edinburgh Castle asking for replacements, who never reached him.

Charles wanted to attack immediately, but Murray argued that their charge would be slowed by the marshy ground in front of Cope&#x27;s centre by exposing the Highlanders to his superior firepower. While his assessment was correct, it was the first in a series of fierce arguments between them that would fatally undermine the Jacobite leadership. Murray convinced the majority that only an attack against the open left flank of Cope&#x27;s army stood any chance of success, and Robert Anderson, a local farmer&#x27;s son who knew the area well, told him of a route through the marshlands. At 4 am, the entire Jacobite force began moving three abreast along the Riggonhead defile, east of Cope&#x27;s position.

To prevent a surprise attack during the night, Cope kept fires burning in front of his position and posted no fewer than 200 dragoons and 300 infantry as pickets. A company of Loudon&#x27;s Highlanders, under Macpherson of Cluny, had deserted from Cope a few days before. The remaining three companies were detailed to guard the baggage park in Cockenzie and Port Seton, and some 100 volunteers were dismissed until the next morning and missed the battle. Warned by his pickets of the Jacobite movement, Cope had enough time to wheel his army to face east (see map) and reposition his cannon. As the Highlanders began their charge, his artillerymen fled, leaving the guns to be fired by their officers.
The two dragoon regiments on the flanks panicked and rode off, leaving Gardiner mortally wounded on the battlefield, who was later carried from the field to Tranent, where he died during the night. Their flight exposed the infantry in the centre, which became attacked on three sides and overrun in less than 15 minutes. With retreat blocked by the park walls behind them, most were taken prisoner, but some escaped when the Highlanders stopped to loot the baggage train. Government losses were roughly 300 to 500 killed or wounded and another 500 to 600 captured, most of whom were released to save the expense of feeding them. Jacobite casualties were estimated as 35 to 40 dead plus 70 to 80 wounded.

Deserted by his gunners, the artillery commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Whitefoord, left the battlefield unharmed after his life was spared by Stewart of Invernahyle. He returned the favour by obtaining a pardon for Stewart after he was captured at Culloden in April 1746. Cope escaped along with Fowke and Lascelles, one of the few members of his regiment to do so. They reached Berwick-upon-Tweed the next day with 450 survivors.

==Aftermath==
Several hours after the battle, Cope wrote to Tweeddale to disclaim responsibility for the defeat: &quot;I cannot reproach myself; the manner in which the enemy came on was quicker than can be described... and the cause of our men taking on a destructive panic...&quot;. Along with Fowke and Lascelles, he was later tried by a court-martial. All three were exonerated, the Court deciding that defeat had been due to the &quot;shameful conduct of the private soldiers&quot;, but Cope never held a senior command again.

The Battle of Killiecrankie (1689) had showed that even experienced troops struggled with the ferocity of the Highland charge, a lesson reinforced at Prestonpans and Falkirk Muir in January 1746. Its weakness was that if the initial charge failed, the Highlanders were not equipped to hold their ground. At Culloden in April, Cumberland&#x27;s troops had been drilled in countering that tactic and inflicted heavy losses on the Scots as a result.

Victory meant the rebellion was now taken more seriously. In mid-October, two French ships arrived at Montrose, bringing money, weapons and an envoy, the Marquis d&#x27;Eguilles. Cumberland and 12,000 troops were recalled from Flanders, including 6,000 German mercenaries who arrived in Berwick-upon-Tweed a few days after Cope. They were immediately available, having been captured at Tournai in June and released on condition that they did not fight against the French.

The argument prior to the battle between Prince Charles and Lord Murray was the first episode in an increasingly-fractious relationship, and the Jacobite Council spent the next six weeks arguing strategy. Reversing the 1707 Union was a significant factor in Scottish Jacobites&#x27; support, which now appeared possible, and they wanted to consolidate their position. Charles and his exile advisors argued the removal of the Hanoverian regime was required to ensure the end of the Union, which meant an invasion of England. The Scots eventually agreed after Charles assured them of substantial English and French support and left Edinburgh on 4 November and entered England on 8 November. Government forces, under General Roger Handasyd, retook Edinburgh on the 14th.

On the march southward, the Council met daily to discuss strategy, and at Derby on 5 December, its members overwhelmingly counselled retreat, the only significant dissenter being Charles. There was no sign of the promised French landing, and despite the large crowds that turned out to see them, only Manchester provided a significant number of recruits. Preston, a Jacobite stronghold in 1715, supplied three. News of another French supply convoy arriving in Montrose seemed to validate the original preference for remaining in Scotland, and the Jacobites turned northward the next day. The rising ended with defeat at Culloden in April 1746.

==Legacy==

In 1953, a memorial to the dead of both sides was erected near the battle site, with a coal bing providing a vantage point for visitors. The &quot;Prestonpans 1745 Heritage Trust&quot; was established in 2006 to provide information on the battle, and the site is included in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland and is protected by Historic Scotland. In 2019, a new visitor centre was proposed, which would permanently house the Prestonpans Tapestry, a depiction of the events leading up to the battle. The site has been partly developed for housing and the former Cockenzie power station. 

Popular perception of the battle and Cope&#x27;s role has largely been set by accounts by third parties, none of whom was present and in one case had not yet been born. In his 1747 book &quot;Life of Colonel Gardiner&quot;, the Nonconformist minister Philip Doddridge portrayed Gardiner, a convert to evangelicalism, as a hero and did so largely by ridiculing Cope. That is an enduring myth and is still recycled today. Gardiner features in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s 1817 novel &quot;Waverley&quot;, whose hero is an English Jacobite. Gardiner&#x27;s heroic death convinces him that the future lies with the Union, rather than with the Stuarts. An obelisk in his memory was set up in the mid-19th century. 

Scott was also responsible for the often-quoted but inaccurate comment attributed to Lord Mark Kerr that Cope was the first general to bring news of his own defeat. Perhaps the best-known legacy of the battle are two songs written by Skirving, a local farmer who visited the battlefield later the same day and was, by his own account, mugged by the victors. They were &quot;Tranent Muir&quot; and the far more famous &quot;Hey, Johnnie Cope, Are Ye Waking Yet?&quot;, a short, catchy and mostly historically-inaccurate insult to Cope; the poet Robert Burns wrote his own words for the song, but they are not as well known as the original by Skirving. The tune is still played by some Scottish regiments for &quot;Reveille&quot; and was also played as the 51st (Highland) Division disembarked on Juno Beach in Normandy on 6 June 1944. 

Participants in the battle included Allan &quot;Breac&quot; Stewart, a soldier in Lee&#x27;s Regiment, who switched sides after being taken prisoner and served in the Jacobite Stewart of Appin&#x27;s regiment. The author Robert Louis Stevenson used him as a lead character in his 1886 novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. The battle forms part of Season 2, Episode 10, of the historical drama television series &quot;Outlander&quot;.

<text>Elisa María Avelina &quot;Lilita&quot; Carrió (born 26 December 1956) is an Argentine lawyer, professor, and politician. She is the leader of Civic Coalition ARI, one of the founders of Cambiemos, and was National Deputy for Chaco Province and Buenos Aires. Carrió is considered a liberal, Christian, and heterodox politician in Argentina. 

==Biography==

Born in Resistencia, Chaco, in a traditional family, Carrió was a former teenage beauty queen. Her father, Rolando &quot;Coco&quot; Carrió, was a prominent Radical Civic Union politician. Her mother, María &quot;Lela&quot; Elisa Rodríguez, was a literature professor. She enrolled at the National University of the Northeast and earned a law degree in 1978 and later earned a graduate degree in Public Law at the National University of the Littoral. Carrió entered public service as a technical advisor to the Chaco Province Prosecutor&#x27;s Office in 1979, and was appointed to the provincial Solicitor General&#x27;s office in 1980. 
She later taught constitutional law at her alma mater, and from 1986 to 1988 served as director of the human rights department of the University of Buenos Aires Law School. In 2004, she founded the Hannah Arendt Institute of Cultural and Political Education (Spanish: Hannah Arendt instituto de formación cultural y política), where she has taught ever since.

==Politics==
Carrió entered politics at the request of her mentor, Raúl Alfonsín, was elected to the 1994 Constitutional Amendments Convention, during which she was a leading sponsor of Article 75, section 22, which mandated the adoption of international human rights treaties ratified by Argentina into the Argentine Constitution. She was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for her province, representing the centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR), in 1995, and in 1997, obtained passage of a bill giving constitutional authority to the international Treaty of Disappeared Persons.

She campaigned heavily for Fernando de la Rúa in 1999. Re-elected to Congress, Carrió earned growing publicity as the chair of the Congressional Committee on Corruption and Money Laundering after 1999, particularly during a series of exchanged accusations in 2001 between herself and Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. 
After the rupture in 2000 of the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education (which the UCR had formed in 1997 with Socialists and the Front for a Country in Solidarity), Carrió turned to the Democratic Socialist Party and other politicians with leftist leanings who were discontented in their parties, and formed an informal front, initially called &quot;Argentinians for a Republic of Equals&quot; (&quot;Argentinos por una República de Iguales&quot;), ARI. After dissensions, the socialists left, and so did Carrió and other figures from their original parties. Together, they formed a new party, called Alternative for a Republic of Equals (also Civic Coalition ARI), in 2002.

In the 2003 elections, Carrió ran for president with Mendoza deputy Gustavo Gutiérrez as the candidate for the Civic Coalition ARI party. Prior to running together, she had worked with him in the 2001 Money Laundering Investigation Commission (Spanish: Comisión investigadora de lavado de dinero). They ended up in the fourth place with about 16% of the votes, behind former president Carlos Menem, would-be president Néstor Kirchner, and minister of economy Ricardo López Murphy. After losing the election, she worked on securing the Civic Coalition ARI, which went through a major crisis during the 2003–07 Kirchner presidency, with members unable to settle their differences and several deputies leaving for the National Government. She returned to the Lower House of Congress in 2005, after winning a seat as a National Deputy for the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires with just over 20% of votes.

Carrió ran again for the Presidency on the 2007 elections, representing a front called the Civic Coalition. In March 2007 she resigned her seat in Congress to conduct the campaign. Together with her running mate Rubén Giustiniani (chairman of the Socialist Party), Carrió obtained about 23% of the vote, coming in a distant second after first lady Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. She won a majority in two of the three largest cities of Argentina (Buenos Aires and Rosario), but she suffered a larger defeat in Buenos Aires Province, the most populous district. Ultimately, Carrió lost to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, and came up well short of forcing her into a ballotage. In Argentina, a presidential candidate can win an outright victory by either winning at least 45 percent of the vote, or 40 to 44 percent of the vote while finishing at least 10 points ahead of the runner-up.

Following the 2007 election, Carrió announced she would not be running for the presidency again, declaring that she would instead enhance her role as &quot;leader of the opposition&quot; and seek to become a member of or influence in a future administration following the 2011 elections. She was reunited ahead of the June 2009 mid-term elections with erstwhile allies, the UCR and Socialists, in the Civic and Social Agreement. This coalition yielded gains only for the UCR, however, and Carrió&#x27;s reduced influence therein ended in her acrimonious departure from the group in August 2010. She later reconsidered her earlier decision to opt out of the 2011 presidential race, and on 12 December 2010, she announced her candidacy on the Civic Coalition/ARI ticket. Carrió received 1.8% of the vote in 23 October election, placing last in a field of seven candidates.

Carrió joined the Broad Front UNEN alliance upon its formation in June 2013, and was reelected to the Lower House on their ticket in elections that October. Her desire to fold UNEN into a coalition led by the PRO party, led to her break with UNEN in November 2014. The UCR also left the coalition and joined the PRO as well. The three parties became a new coalition, &quot;Cambiemos&quot; (). She run for the presidency in the primary elections, and lost to Mauricio Macri. Macri won the 2015 general elections afterwards.

She voted against the legalization of abortion. After losing in the vote, Elisa Carrió left angry and warned: &quot;Let it be clear to everyone Cambiemos, next time I&#x27;ll break [ties].&quot;

On 1 March 2020, she resigned as a national deputy.

==Personal life==
Carrió always appears in public wearing a crucifix, claims to take communion every day and once told Raúl Alfonsín she had seen the Virgin Mary. She is against decriminalization of drug use and abortion. Carrió marked her firm stance against abortion before and after entering Congress, including during the time Cambiemos co-founder Mauricio Macri encouraged legislators of the alliance to maturely and responsibly debate an issue, as it divided both the opposition and the ruling party. She refrained from legalizing gay marriage and was neutral about it.

<text>The Battle of Hohenfriedberg or Hohenfriedeberg (now Dobromierz, Poland), also known as the Battle of Striegau (now Strzegom, Poland) was one of Frederick the Great&#x27;s most admired victories. Frederick&#x27;s Prussian army decisively defeated an Austrian army under Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine on June 4, 1745, during the Second Silesian War – part of the War of the Austrian Succession.

== Background ==
Austria sought to regain Silesia, which had been lost to Prussia in the Battle of Mollwitz. An Austrian army of about 62,500, including allied Saxon troops, marched to Silesia. The commander was Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, brother-in-law of Empress Maria Theresa. Johann Adolf II, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels commanded the Saxons.

Frederick had a very low opinion of his counterpart, saying of Prince Charles Alexander that &quot;there will be some stupid mistakes.&quot; In fact, Frederick was counting on Charles entering Silesia by crossing the Giant Mountains. If he did, Frederick intended to attack the Austrian army and crush it in one decisive blow. Hans Joachim von Zieten&#x27;s Zieten-Hussars shadowed the Austrian army, keeping Frederick informed of their movements and position as he awaited the right moment to strike. When the Prince finally did cross in early June, Frederick saw his opportunity to attack.

The Austrian army marched some northeast from the Giant Mountains to Striegau (now Strzegom). They encamped near Striegau, with the Saxons just northwest of the town at Pilgrimshain and the Austrians spreading out west and south to the village of Hohenfriedberg. Their front was covered by the Striegau River, which ran north and then west through Striegau town. The Prussian army was camped south of the town.

Prussian scouts located the Austro-Saxon forces. Frederick decided to march north with his whole force, right in front of the Austrians, cross the Striegau by a bridge just west of town, and attack the Saxons first. With the Saxons routed, Frederick would then roll up the Austrian line from east to west. He also decided to march by night, concealing his movement, and thus surprise the Saxons. One of Frederick&#x27;s generals, Peter Ludwig de Moulin led the march.

To achieve surprise, Frederick ordered his troops to leave their campfires burning and tents pitched, and forbade them to talk or smoke during the march.

== Battle ==

Frederick&#x27;s plan soon encountered difficulties. There was not enough space for all of the Prussian troops on the designated route. A bottleneck soon developed at the bridge over the Striegau, so only limited forces were able to make it over.

The first Prussian objective was two hills in front of the Saxon lines. The Saxon army had occupied these two hills the previous day with a small force. The Prussian vanguard encountered this force; the resulting clash alerted the Saxons and prevented the complete surprise Frederick hoped for.

De Moulin decided to bypass the hills and strike right at the Saxon camp before the Saxons could deploy. The Prussian attack began at about 7:00 AM.

Some Saxon cavalry got out on the field, but the Prussian cavalry soon charged and routed them. The Prussian infantry then stormed the Saxon camp, defeating the few Saxon infantry that managed to deploy, and also a few Austrian troops. The easterly wind, blowing smoke and dust into the Saxons&#x27; faces, was also advantageous for the Prussians. The entire left (Saxon) half of the Austro-Saxon army was destroyed in the hours of the dawn&#x27;s light.

By then the Austrians were alerted to the battle. From their camps further to the south and more protected by the river, Austrian troops moved to the front. The Prussians who had still not crossed the Striegau to the north wheeled to the west and advanced through river crossings wherever they could find them, finding enough fords to accomplish this. A bridge collapse at the small town of Graben forced the cavalry commander, Hans Joachim von Zieten, to find a ford further south through which to funnel cavalry and pack mules carrying supplies.

The Austrian cavalry were the first Austrian troops to get into action, but they were broken and driven off by the charge of the Prussian cavalry.

The Austrian infantry formed two lines of battle facing east, from Hohenfriedberg north. Though the Prussians now had the advantage of numbers, the Austrians resisted stubbornly, with many volleys exchanged at close range.

At this point the Prussian Bayreuth Dragoons, numbering around 1,500 men, entered the battle. A strong gust of wind blew away the powder smoke and the dust and revealed an opening in the Austrian lines through which to charge the vulnerable Austrian infantry. The dragoons deployed into line, and attacked north against the right flank of the first Austrian line. They drove all the way along that line, routing it completely, then turned south to destroy the second Austrian line.

The Austrians, already outnumbered, abandoned by their Saxon allies, without cavalry protection, and now broken by this attack, began to surrender &quot;en masse&quot;. The Bayreuth Dragoons defeated several thousand Austrian infantry and only suffered 94 casualties. The Dragoons overran twenty battalions, took 2,500 prisoners, capturing 67 flags and standards as well as four cannons in what is considered and celebrated as one of the great cavalry battlefield triumphs. The battle ended with the complete defeat of the Austro-Saxon army.

The Austrians and Saxons lost almost 9,000 killed and wounded, about 5,000 prisoners, including four generals, and 66 guns. The Prussians lost around 5,000.

== Aftermath ==
Hohenfriedberg was a great victory for Frederick, and soon, he was being called &quot;Frederick the Great&quot; by his contemporaries. The charge of the Bayreuth Dragoons was studied by later Prussian and German officers as a model for aggressiveness, and the entire spirit of aggressiveness that Frederick had instilled in his army and the large amount of autonomy given to his officers were likened to the tradition of &quot;Mission-type tactics&quot;. A delighted Fredrick wrote that &quot;there has not been so decisive a defeat since Blenheim&quot;.

Charles of Lorraine was defeated again just as at the Battle of Chotusitz, which showed that the Prussians could crush a numerically-equal enemy. The Second Silesian War, which was the last part of the War of the Austrian Succession in which Prussia took part, was almost at an end despite a close call at the Battle of Soor against the Austrians, who were again led by Charles of Lorraine, the peace at Dresden was signed on 25 December 1745, soon after yet another Prussian victory at the Battle of Kesselsdorf against the Saxons.

The &quot;Der Hohenfriedberger&quot; was a march composed in honor of the victory, allegedly by Frederick himself.

<text>Westfields Football Club is a football team from Hereford, England, formed in 1966 and currently playing in the . The club is affiliated to the Herefordshire County FA.

==History==
Westfields FC were formed in November 1966 by a group of local youths who played friendlies on Widemarsh Common. One of the youths, Andy Morris, is still involved with the club and is now its chief executive.

Westfields initially entered the Herefordshire Sunday League, where they played for ten years, winning a number of trophies. In 1973, they fielded their first Saturday team in the Worcester and District League. Two years later they moved their ground from the King George V playing fields to Thorn Lighting&#x27;s Rotherwas headquarters where they gradually developed the ground over the subsequent years.

In 1978, the club stepped up to the West Midlands (Regional) League, initially in Division Two. Promotion to Division One came in 1983–84, followed by a further step up to the Premier Division three years later.

The 2002–03 season saw the club do a league and county cup double, becoming the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division champions for the first time and defeating rivals Kington Town to win the Herefordshire County Challenge Cup. The title win saw them promoted to the Midland Alliance, where they finished sixth in their first season, although their second season saw them flirt with relegation before finishing in 20th position.

In the 2015–16 season, they reached the Herefordshire County Challenge Cup final at Edgar Street, but lost to newly-formed Hereford, their divisional rivals in the Midland Football League.

During the 2016–17 season they qualified for the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in their history where they faced National League North club Curzon Ashton. After drawing 1–1 at home, they lost 3–1 in the replay and were knocked out.

In February 2018, manager Sean Edwards, who was in charge during the club&#x27;s famous FA Cup run, resigned. He was replaced by coach Andy Bevan. Bevan himself resigned in May 2019, being replaced by former captain and coach Phil Glover.

In 2019, the club was transferred from the Midland Football League to the Hellenic League as part of a reorganisation at step 5 of the National League System.

In September 2023, the club parted ways with manager Phil Glover after their poor start to the season. He was replaced by former player Scott Russell on 5 October.

Westfields took their claret and blue colours from West Ham United, as its founders admired Bobby Moore, Martin Peters and Sir Geoff Hurst, who were part of the England squad that won the World Cup in the year they were founded.

==Ground==
After playing for many years at the sports ground of Thorn Lighting on the Rotherwas Industrial Estate to the south of Hereford, Westfields began their first Midland Alliance campaign playing their home games at Stourport Swifts&#x27; Walshes Meadow ground. Westfields moved to a new £250,000 ground in the heart of the city in December 2003. The new ground gained the rather unusual name of allpay.park after a sponsorship deal with Hereford-based firm allpay.net.

<text>Prosobranchia was a large taxonomic subclass of sea snails, land snails and freshwater snails. This taxon of gastropods dates back to the 1920s. It has however been proven to be polyphyletic (consisting of more than one lineage of descent). Generally speaking in biology taxonomy is required to reflect phylogeny, in other words the classification of a group must reflect its evolutionary descent, as far as that is known, so the taxon Prosobranchia is no longer considered suitable to be used.

One can still encounter this subclass used as if it is still valid in many texts and websites. Although Prosobranchia is no longer generally accepted as a taxon by people who study living Mollusca, still the term prosobranch is legitimately used as an anatomically descriptive adjective or noun, and the taxon Prosobranchia is still sometimes used by paleontologists.

&quot;Prosobranch&quot; means &quot;gills in front&quot; (of the heart). In contrast &quot;opisthobranch&quot; means &quot;gills behind&quot; (and to the right of the heart). Prosobranchs have their gills, mantle cavity and anus situated in front of their heart. Most prosobranchs have separate sexes.

The majority of marine gastropods are prosobranch, as are a few land snails and freshwater snails. The prosobranch gastropods include the majority of marine snails, among them conches, cones, cowries, limpets, murexes, periwinkles, volutes and whelks, as well as numerous freshwater groups, and some land snails with an operculum.

==Description==
The majority of prosobranchs have an operculum, a corneous or calcareous plate situated on the dorsal surface of the foot. In many prosobranchs, the animal can completely close the aperture with the operculum.

The nervous system of prosobranchs is twisted into a figure 8 due to a developmental process known as torsion. The eyes are situated at the base of the tentacles.

==Taxonomic context==
The taxonomy of the gastropods is changing rapidly. The old classification (Johannes Thiele) divided Gastropoda into three subclasses: Prosobranchia, Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata. The subclass Prosobranchia (Henri Milne-Edwards) was further divided into the orders Archaeogastropoda, Mesogastropoda and Neogastropoda. The new version of the gastropod classification is explained in &quot; Taxonomy of the Gastropoda&quot; (Ponder &amp; Lindberg, 1997).

<text>Christopher Dennis Alexander Martin-Jenkins, MBE (20 January 1945 – 1 January 2013), also known as CMJ, was a British cricket journalist and a President of MCC. He was also the longest serving commentator for &quot;Test Match Special&quot; (TMS) on BBC Radio, from 1973 until diagnosed with terminal cancer in March 2012.

==Early life==
Christopher Martin-Jenkins was born at his grandmother&#x27;s house in Peterborough, the second of three boys. His father, a lieutenant colonel in the army at the time, relocated the family to Glasgow where he was stationed. After demobilisation he returned to his job at the shipping firm Ellerman Lines where he subsequently became chairman. His mother was a radiologist and GP, working in the Gorbals during the war.

==School==
He went to St Bede&#x27;s Prep School in Eastbourne and then to Marlborough. He first played for the school team in 1962 under the captaincy of future Sussex captain (1968–1972) and chairman of MCC (2012–2013), Mike Griffith. The following year, after becoming captain of the school cricket XI, Martin-Jenkins wrote to Brian Johnston asking him how to become a cricket commentator. Johnston invited him to Broadcasting House, took him out to lunch and told him to develop his ability and review his performance by practising his commentating skills by using a tape recorder. That year he also scored a valiant 99 in Marlborough&#x27;s second innings in the annual fixture against Rugby School at Lord&#x27;s, but despite this they still lost by 22 runs.

==University==
He went to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he read Modern History and graduated with an upper second in 1967. During his time at Cambridge he won two half-blues for Rugby fives but never played for the University cricket first XI, although he narrowly missed out on gaining his blue after he was named 12th man for the 1967 Varsity match at Lord&#x27;s. Nevertheless, he skippered the Crusaders (the University 2nd XI) during 1966 and 1967 and was also a successful captain of his college XI.

He had a great talent for mimicry, which enabled him to progress to final auditions for the Cambridge University Footlights, where his performance was adjudicated by a panel that included Germaine Greer, Eric Idle and Clive James.

==Cricketer==
He played one Second XI Championship match for Surrey against Warwickshire at the Oval in 1971. Thereafter he appeared for the Sir Paul Getty XI in ten one-day games at Wormsley between 1992 and 2002, with a valedictory appearance, aged 61, against the Heartaches team run by Tim Rice in 2006.

==Media career==
Following his graduation in 1967 Martin-Jenkins joined &quot;The Cricketer&quot; magazine as deputy editor under E. W. Swanton. In March 1970 he left to join the BBC Radio Sports News department and subsequently commentated on his first match, a one-day international between England and Australia, in 1972. His last commentary, 40 years later, was for &quot;TMS&quot; on England&#x27;s third Test against Pakistan in Dubai in February 2012.

He joined the &quot;TMS&quot; team in 1973 and was appointed cricket correspondent in succession to Brian Johnston in 1973 and worked as cricket correspondent for the BBC (1973–1980, 1985–1991), &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (1990–1999) and &quot;The Times&quot; (1999–2008). Mike Atherton replaced him as &quot;The Times&quot; Chief Cricket Correspondent on 1 May 2008 although CMJ continued contributing to the &quot;Times&quot; cricket pages, filing his last article on the death of Tony Greig on 31 December, the day prior to his own death. He was also a BBC TV commentator for their cricket coverage between 1981 and 1985, before returning to radio.

In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, his obituarist wrote of his radio commentary that: &quot;Nobody excelled him... in what he regarded as the first duty: that of giving a precise, clear, well-informed and accurate account of every ball that was bowled and every stroke that was played.&quot; Scyld Berry wrote: &quot;What made him so good as a radio commentator, apart from his precise and unforced diction, was that he came closer than anyone to combining the knowledge of an expert with the enthusiasm of a student.&quot;

By temperament conciliatory, he was rarely involved in controversy. However, during a Test on England&#x27;s 1989–90 tour of the West Indies he criticised the umpire Lloyd Barker, claiming that he had allowed himself to be pressurised by the West Indies captain, Viv Richards, into wrongly giving Rob Bailey out caught down the leg side. Barker threatened to sue, believing incorrectly that Martin-Jenkins had called him a cheat. The case was settled by the BBC without going to court.

He was renowned among his broadcasting colleagues for a certain vagueness regarding practical matters. Jonathan Agnew described how on one occasion he arrived at Lord&#x27;s for a match which unfortunately was due to be played on the other side of London at the Oval. He also struggled with modern technology, once mistaking the television remote control in his hotel room for his mobile phone. When attempting to email a report to his newspaper, he would occasionally press the Delete button rather than the Send button, causing him much consternation.

==Author==
Martin-Jenkins was the author of &quot;The Complete Who&#x27;s Who of Test Cricketers&quot;. Altogether he wrote or edited 25 books including &quot;The Wisden Book of County Cricket&quot; (1981); &quot;Bedside Cricket&quot; (1981); &quot;Twenty Years On: Cricket&#x27;s years of change&quot; (1984); &quot;Cricket: a way of life&quot; (1984); &quot;Grand Slam&quot; (1987); &quot;Cricket Characters&quot; (1987); &quot;Sketches of a Season&quot; (1987); and &quot;Ball by Ball: The Story of Cricket Broadcasting&quot; (1990) and finally concluding with his autobiography, &quot;CMJ – A Cricketing Life&quot;.

He edited &quot;The Cricketer&quot; from 1980 and was President of the Cricket Society from 1998 to 2008.

==Awards and honours==
He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours.

He was President of MCC for 2010–11, a rare honour for a journalist. His time in office was a difficult one, as it coincided with the £400 million redevelopment plan for Lord&#x27;s being dropped in favour of something better suited to the difficult economic situation. This led to an as yet unresolved split in the membership between those in favour of the new plan and those who still support the old one.

In 2007 he was invited to deliver the annual MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture, becoming the only career journalist and broadcaster to do so. As MCC President, in 2011 he invited Kumar Sangakkara to deliver the same lecture, the only actively playing cricketer to have delivered a Cowdrey Lecture.

==Personal life==
He met Judy Hayman at Cambridge and they married in April 1971. They had two sons, James and Robin, and a daughter, Lucy. Robin Martin-Jenkins played county cricket for Sussex before retiring in 2010, while elder brother James played club cricket for Radley Rangers from 1993 to 2006.

==Death==
During 2009 and 2010 his health seemed to be declining when he had a bad bout of pneumonia, followed by acute hepatitis. He was subsequently diagnosed with terminal cancer in March 2012, shortly after returning from commentating duties in the UAE, and was forced to step down from &quot;Test Match Special&quot; due to his illness. He died of lymphoma, at his home in Horsham, on the morning of 1 January 2013, at the age of 67.

A statement from his family said: &quot;Christopher died peacefully at home this morning after his brave resistance to cancer. The family is extremely proud of all that he did to pass on his love of cricket worldwide with his gift of communicating through the spoken and written word. He was above all a much loved husband, brother, father and grandfather.&quot;

A memorial service was held in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 16 April 2013, attended by 2,000 people including at least six former England captains. The service included readings by his sons, James and Robin, and tributes by Sir Tim Rice and Jonathan Agnew. After the service there was a reception at Lord&#x27;s.

<doc id="646151" wikidata="Q279330" url="?curid=646151" title="Bronchospasm">
<text>Bronchospasm or a bronchial spasm is a sudden constriction of the muscles in the walls of the bronchioles. It is caused by the release (degranulation) of substances from mast cells or basophils under the influence of anaphylatoxins. It causes difficulty in breathing which ranges from mild to severe.

Bronchospasms occur in asthma, chronic bronchitis and anaphylaxis. Bronchospasms are a possible side effect of some drugs: pilocarpine, beta blockers (used to treat hypertension), a paradoxical result of using LABA drugs (to treat COPD), and other drugs. Bronchospasms can present as a sign of giardiasis.

Some factors that contribute to bronchospasm include consuming certain foods, taking certain medicines, allergic responses to insects, and fluctuating hormone levels, particularly in women.
Bronchospasms are one of several conditions associated with cold housing.

The overactivity of the bronchioles&#x27; muscle is a result of exposure to a stimulus which under normal circumstances would cause little or no response. The resulting constriction and inflammation causes a narrowing of the airways and an increase in mucus production; this reduces the amount of oxygen that is available to the individual causing breathlessness, coughing and hypoxia.

Bronchospasms are a serious potential complication of placing a breathing tube during general anesthesia. When the airways spasm or constrict in response to the irritating stimulus of the breathing tube, it is difficult to maintain the airway and the patient can become apneic. During general anesthesia, signs of bronchospasm include wheezing, high peak inspiratory pressures, increased intrinsic PEEP, decreased expiratory tidal volumes, and an upsloping capnograph (obstructive pattern).  In severe cases, there may be complete inability to ventilate and loss of ETCO2 as well as hypoxia and desaturation.

==Cause==
Bronchospasms can occur for a number of reasons. Lower respiratory tract conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and emphysema can result in contraction of the airways. Other causes are side effects of topical decongestants such as oxymetazoline and phenylephrine. Both of these medications activate alpha-1 adrenergic receptors that result in smooth muscle constriction. Non-selective beta blockers are known to facilitate bronchospasm as well. Beta blockers bind to the β2 receptors and block the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine causing shortness of breath.

Additionally, the pediatric population is more susceptible to disease and complications from bronchospasm due to their airway diameter being smaller; applying Poiseuille&#x27;s Law to the airways it is clear that airflow resistance through a tube is inversely related to the radius of the tube to the fourth power, therefore, decreases in airway results in significant flow impediments.

==Diagnosis==
Signs and symptoms:
* Wheezing
* Diminished breath sounds
* Prolonged expiration
* Increase airway pressures (in ventilated patients)

==Treatment==

===Beta 2 agonists===

Beta2-adrenergic agonists are recommended for bronchospasm.
* Short acting (SABA)
** Terbutaline
** Salbutamol
** Levosalbutamol
* Long acting (LABA)
** Formoterol
** Salmeterol
* Others
** Epinephrine - titrate to effect (e.g. 10-50 mcg IV), especially in setting of hemodynamic compromise
** increasing anesthetic depth
** IV magnesium
** Increase FiO2 to 100% and consider manual ventilation

===Muscarinic Acetylcholine receptor antagonist===
The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is known to decrease sympathetic response by slowing the heart rate and constricting the smooth muscle tissue. Ongoing research and successful clinical trials have shown that agents such as diphenhydramine, atropine and ipratropium bromide (all of which act as receptor antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) are effective for treating asthma and COPD-related symptoms.

<text>Amber Mariano (née Brkich; born August 11, 1978) is an American television personality and winner of &quot;&quot; with its $1,000,000 prize, after appearing as a contestant on one of its predecessors, &quot;&quot;, where she placed 6th. Later, she was a participant in the 40th season, &quot;&quot;, where she placed 20th, being the second voted out and the first member of the jury. She is married to fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; contestant of &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Survivor: Winners at War&quot; and winner of &quot;&quot;, Rob Mariano, with whom she appeared on &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; twice, where they placed 2nd and 8th. The two have four daughters together.

==Personal life==
Amber Brkich went to Beaver Area High School. She is a graduate of Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, north of Pittsburgh, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in public relations, with a minor in speech communications, in 2000. She is an alumna of Alpha Gamma Delta, having served as vice president and new member coordinator while still in school. She is of Croatian and Albanian descent on her paternal side.

She began a relationship with fellow reality star Rob Mariano in 2003, when they formed an alliance as castmates on &quot;&quot;. They became engaged on May 9, 2004, during the show&#x27;s live finale at Madison Square Garden in New York City, and married on April 16, 2005, at Atlantis Paradise Island in The Bahamas. CBS aired a two-hour special about the wedding, entitled &quot;Rob and Amber Get Married&quot;, on May 24, 2005. After their marriage, the couple moved to Pensacola, Florida. They have four daughters: Lucia Rose (born July 4, 2009), Carina Rose (born December 10, 2010), Isabetta Rose (born May 5, 2012), and Adelina Rose (born June 20, 2014). Their family are members of the Catholic Church.

==&quot;Survivor&quot;==

===&quot;The Australian Outback&quot;===

Brkich was a participant in the second season of &quot;Survivor&quot;, having auditioned for the season on a whim. She was a member of the green Ogakor tribe, and she was quick to fortify a strong friendship with fellow contestant Jerri Manthey, who helped construct an alliance with Colby Donaldson and Mitchell Olson.

Upon the merge, Ogakor managed to use the knowledge that one of Kucha&#x27;s members, Jeff Varner, had received votes beforehand, and eliminated him, thus gaining a numeric advantage over the other group. Later in the game however, it was decided by a majority of the remaining players that Brkich had played &quot;under-the-radar&quot;, and she was sent home, ultimately landing in sixth place.

As a member of the jury, she cast her vote for Donaldson, who lost to Tina Wesson in a 4–3 vote.

Immediately following her appearance on &quot;&quot;, Brkich appeared on the cover of &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine. &quot;Maxim&quot; ranked her as the 50th most beautiful woman in the world in 2004 and 73rd in 2005. She also appeared in various commercials for Adelphia Cable, Rite Aid drugstores, and Mountaineer Racetrack in West Virginia.

===&quot;All-Stars&quot;===

Brkich was a member of the Chapera tribe, a group including Rob Mariano, Sue Hawk, and fellow &quot;The Australian Outback&quot; player Alicia Calaway. In the season&#x27;s premiere episode, Mariano and Brkich agreed to form an alliance. They faced their first Tribal Council in the fourth episode, and their relationship was a matter of discussion; but ultimately, it was Rob Cesternino who was sent home. Due to a twist that dissolved one of the three tribes, Jenna Lewis and Rupert Boneham joined the Chapera tribe leading to Mariano and Brkich quickly fortifying a long-term alliance with the duo.

Mid-game, a tribal shuffle managed to swap every contestant to the opposite tribe with the exception of Brkich, who remained on the Chapera tribe with Lex van den Berghe, Shii Ann Huang, Jerri Manthey, and Kathy Vavrick-O&#x27;Brien. The tribe went on to lose the next challenge and upon leaving, Mariano informed van den Berghe that he would take care of him if he took care of Brkich. Van den Berghe, Huang, and Vavrick-O&#x27;Brien voted out Manthey in hopes that Mariano would keep his word.

After the merge, van den Berghe was voted out despite Mariano promising to take care of him. Mariano and Brkich also managed to maintain several &quot;alliances,&quot; including their agreement with Boneham and Lewis, one with &quot;Big Tom&quot; Buchanan, and one with Calaway. Eventually, the pair ended up in the Final Four with Lewis and Boneham. Once there, Brkich won her first individual Immunity challenge, and she and Mariano convinced Lewis to vote out Boneham instead of forcing a tie. In the final three, Mariano won immunity and chose Brkich to continue with him to the Final Two. Facing the jury, they both met criticism for their gameplay. Ultimately, Brkich was victorious by becoming the Sole Survivor in a 4–3 vote, securing her the winner by receiving votes from van den Berghe, Calaway, Huang, and Buchanan while Mariano received votes from Vavrick-O&#x27;Brien, Boneham and Lewis. Before the vote was read, Mariano proposed to Brkich, which she accepted without hesitation.

===&quot;Winners at War&quot;===

After a 16-year and 32-season hiatus, Brkich, now using her married name of Mariano, returned to compete on the show&#x27;s first all-winners season alongside her husband, Rob. She was a member of the Dakal tribe. After they lost the second immunity challenge, Mariano became the second contestant voted off as well as the second person sent to the Edge of Extinction. She lost the two Edge return challenges to Tyson Apostol and Natalie Anderson respectively and then became a permanent member of the jury on day 35. Her placement dropped down to 20th after the first boot Anderson won the second re-entry duel. Mariano voted for Tony Vlachos to win the season, which he did in a 12-4-0 vote and become the second two-time winner in &quot;Survivor&quot; history.

==&quot;The Amazing Race&quot;==

===&quot;Season 7&quot;===

As an engaged couple, Mariano and Brkich participated in the seventh season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; and came in second place.

During a Roadblock challenge in Mendoza, Argentina, in the third leg of the race, contestants had to eat four pounds of meat. Mariano began the roadblock but very quickly determined he would not or could not eat that quantity. The penalty for not finishing the Roadblock was a 4-hour delay. By convincing several other contestants to refuse to participate, he ensured that several contestants were on the same timetable as he and Brkich. Also in South America, Mariano pooled his money with some other racers to bribe the bus driver to let the teams that contributed off earlier. When he did bribe the driver, Mariano used none of his own money.

In Botswana, during the sixth leg of the race, the couple was criticized by fellow racers, as well as host Phil Keoghan, when they drove by the car accident of another team, brothers Brian and Greg, without stopping. Their fellow competitors all checked in with the brothers prior to continuing on to the next stage of the race.

Mariano and Brkich ultimately finished in second place behind married couple Uchenna and Joyce. Amongst fans, there has been much speculation surrounding the final leg of the race. It has been argued that the production crew had intervened with the airport authorities and aided Uchenna and Joyce onto the same earlier plane as Mariano and Brkich. In the &quot;Revisiting the Race&quot; special feature on the Season 7 DVD, Mariano, along with Uchenna and Keoghan denied these accusations. Mariano describes Uchenna running around frantically trying to get onto the flight, which the final edited version of the show does not portray. Keoghan cites the fact that the decision to re-open the door rested solely with the pilot, and that intervention by the production crew would have resulted in someone leaking such information out. Although Mariano and Brkich lost the one million dollar grand prize and &quot;The Amazing Race 7&quot; winners&#x27; title at the final leg of the race, they managed to place 1st in the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 10th legs. They were the only team to not come in last place on any legs of the race.

===&quot;All-Stars&quot;===

In 2007, the Marianos competed on the &quot;All-Stars&quot; season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; as newlyweds. After achieving first place for the first three legs, they came in last and were eliminated in the season&#x27;s fourth episode which aired on March 11, 2007.

==&quot;Rob and Amber: Against the Odds&quot;==
In 2006, the Marianos filmed a ten-episode show for the Fox Reality Channel, &quot;Rob and Amber: Against the Odds&quot;, which aired in 2007. Set in Las Vegas, the show follows Rob&#x27;s attempt to become a professional poker player and features professional player Daniel Negreanu tutoring him.

<doc id="646158" wikidata="Q40262" url="?curid=646158" title="David Gross">
<text>David Jonathan Gross (; born February 19, 1941) is an American theoretical physicist and string theorist. Along with Frank Wilczek and David Politzer, he was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery of asymptotic freedom. Gross is the Chancellor&#x27;s Chair Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP) of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), and was formerly the KITP director and holder of their Frederick W. Gluck Chair in Theoretical Physics. He is also a faculty member in the UCSB Physics Department and is affiliated with the Institute for Quantum Studies at Chapman University in California. He is a foreign member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

==Early life and education==
Gross was born to a Jewish family from Austro-Hungary. His grandfather was born in Hungary. in Washington, D.C., in February 1941. His parents were Nora (Faine) and Bertram Myron Gross (1912–1997). Gross received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, in 1962. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1966, under the supervision of Geoffrey Chew.

==Research and career==
In 1973, Gross, working with his first graduate student, Frank Wilczek, at Princeton University, discovered asymptotic freedom—the primary feature of non-Abelian gauge theories—which led Gross and Wilczek to the formulation of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force. Asymptotic freedom is a phenomenon where the nuclear force weakens at short distances, which explains why experiments at very high energy can be understood as if nuclear particles are made of non-interacting quarks. Therefore, the closer quarks are to each other, the less the strong interaction (or color charge) is between them; when quarks are in extreme proximity, the nuclear force between them is so weak that they behave almost as free particles. The flip side of asymptotic freedom is that the force between quarks grows stronger as one tries to separate them. This is the reason why the nucleus of an atom can never be broken into its quark constituents.

QCD completed the Standard Model, which details the three basic forces of particle physics—the electromagnetic force, the weak force, and the strong force. Gross was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics, with Politzer and Wilczek, for this discovery.

Gross, with Jeffrey A. Harvey, Emil Martinec, and Ryan Rohm also formulated the theory of the heterotic string. The four were whimsically nicknamed the &quot;Princeton String Quartet.&quot; He continues to do research in this field at the KITP.

He was a junior fellow at Harvard University (1966–69) and a Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Princeton University until 1997, when he began serving as Princeton&#x27;s Thomas Jones Professor of Mathematical Physics Emeritus. He has received many honors, including a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1987 and the Dirac Medal in 1988.

==Activism==
In 2003, Gross was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.

Gross is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

In 2015, Gross signed the &quot;Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change&quot; on the final day of the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, François Hollande, as part of the successful COP21 climate summit in Paris.

== Family ==
Gross&#x27; first wife was Shulamith (Toaff), and they had two children. He also has a stepdaughter by his second wife, Jacquelyn Savani. He has three brothers, including Larry Gross, professor of communication, Samuel R. Gross, professor of law, and Theodore (Teddy) Gross, a playwright.

<doc id="646159" wikidata="Q2842424" url="?curid=646159" title="Culture of Uruguay">
<text>The culture of [[Uruguay]] is diverse since the nation&#x27;s population is one of multicultural origins. Modern Uruguayan culture and lifestyle are heavily influenced by European traditions, due to the contributions of large numbers of immigrants who arrived in the country from the 19th century onwards, especially from Italy and Spain. 

From the year 1858 to 1950 large waves of European immigrants began arriving to Uruguay, with the majority of the immigrants coming from Italy. Minor European immigrant groups – French, Germans, Swiss, Russians, Jews, and Armenians, among others – also migrated to Uruguay. Uruguay has century-old remains and fortresses of the colonial era. Its cities have a rich architectural heritage, and a number of writers, artists, and musicians. Carnaval and candombe are the most important examples of African influence by slaves, as well as Umbanda religious beliefs and practices. Guarani traditions can be seen in the national drink, mate.

==Visual arts==
===Painting and sculpture===

Well-known Uruguayan painters include realists such as Juan Manuel Blanes, constructivists such as Joaquín Torres García, nativists like Carlos María Herrera, post-impressionists such as Pedro Figari and Felipe Seade, abstract artists such as Carlos Páez Vilaró, and numerous others.
Well-known sculptors include realists Pablo Atchugarry, José Belloni, and José Luis Zorrilla de San Martín, as well as contemporary sculptors such as Juan José Calandria, Águeda Dicancro, Hugo Nantes, Claudio Silveira Silva, Mariví Ugolino, and Carlos Páez Vilaró, who created an internationally renowned &quot;livable sculpture&quot;, &quot;Casapueblo&quot;.

===Architecture===
Due to European migration, new forms of art and design started to enter during the formation of Uruguay. Many buildings in Uruguay are European influenced, for example, the Palacio Salvo was designed by Italian architect Mario Palanti.

Many well recognized architects around the world are Uruguayan. Some famous Uruguayan architects include Juan Antonio Scasso, Juan Giuria, Leopoldo Artucio, Eladio Dieste, and Carlos Ott.

Rafael Viñoly is a Uruguayan architect known for his most recognized project being the 432 Park Avenue in New York City. The building stands at 1,396 feet (425.5 m) with 96 floors, making it the tallest residential building in the world. He is also credited for designing other buildings such as the Tokyo International Forum, Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, and Uruguay&#x27;s international airport Carrasco International Airport.

==Modern society==
===Immigration===
Among the several peoples who settled Uruguay and formed the backbone of its society must be highlighted Spaniards and Italians, together with some descendants of African slaves. While Spaniards being the greatest contributor to other South American countries, Italians are arguably the greatest contributor to Uruguay. There are also significant minorities: Armenians, Austrians, Basque, Britons, Bulgarians, Croats, French, Germans, Greeks, Roma, Hungarians, Irish, Scots, Jews, Lebanese, Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, Slovaks, Slovenes, Swiss, and Ukrainians. There are very small Asian communities, mainly from China, Japan and Korea.

===Languages===
Spanish is the de facto national language, and is virtually spoken by the entire population. The standard language is Uruguayan Spanish, which is a variant of Rioplatense Spanish. This variant is known in the Hispanosphere for its marked Italian influence in its intonation and vocabulary. Additionally, lunfardo argot is widely used among the population. 

The Uruguayan Portuguese or &quot;fronteiriço—&quot;a pidgin mixing Uruguayan Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese&quot;—&quot;is spoken in the northeast of the country, where cultural exchanges occur between communities on both sides of the border. Minority languages in Uruguay include Italian, French, German, Hebrew, and other European languages, which are present in the country due to the significant waves of migration from Europe. English is the most widespread foreign language among the Uruguayan people.

Since 2001, Uruguayan Sign Language is an official language.

===Gestures===

Uruguayan gestures are mostly adopted from Southern European culture, with hand gestures and tones being all used commonly throughout the country. A gesture that is only specifically used in Argentina and Uruguay is males kissing other males on the cheek, sometimes both cheeks, as a way of greeting. For the rest of Latin America, kissing on cheek as a form of greeting is mostly towards a male and female, or a female to another female.

==Popular culture==
===Humour===
Uruguayan humour has been present for over 200 years. Written humour has been developed by notable writers. Later on, during the civic-military dictatorship, satirical magazines such as &quot;El dedo&quot; and &quot;Guambia&quot; were notable vehicles for expressing dissatisfaction.

Modern media have been crucial in its development. The television programme &quot;Telecataplúm&quot; made history both in Uruguay and Argentina, followed by &quot;Decalegrón&quot;. 

Currently the radio figure Orlando Petinatti leads the radio programme &quot;Malos Pensamientos&quot;.

===Music===

Uruguayans enjoy music such as tango, folk, and waltz as well as local forms such as candombe, milonga and murga. Both tango and candombe have been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Uruguay&#x27;s annual Carnival is a major event with many unique features distinguishing it from those of its neighbours. Rock, jazz, pop and other international genres also enjoy great popularity in Uruguay.

===Motion pictures===
The first Uruguayan motion picture is &quot;Carrera de bicicletas en el velódromo de Arroyo Seco&quot;. The film was directed by Félix Oliver, the pioneer of cinematography in Uruguay. The best reviewed Uruguayan movie is the 2004 film, &quot;Whisky&quot;. Directed by Juan Pablo Rebella and Pablo Stoll, with a starring cast of Andrés Pazos, Mirella Pascual, and Jorge Bolani, it was well-received by film critics.

===Smoking===

Roughly 1/3 of Uruguayan adults smoke tobacco, according to Uruguayan research groups. On March 1, 2006, a law went into effect banning smoking in all enclosed public spaces in Uruguay, including restaurants and bars, among the toughest smoking bans worldwide and the strictest in Latin America. The penalty for businesses that allow smoking is a fine of roughly US $1,100 or a three-day closure. One opinion poll found that 70% of smokers supported the ban. Current President of Uruguay in that year, Tabaré Vázquez, was a medic doctor specializing in cancer treatment.

==Literature==

One of Uruguay&#x27;s most famous works of literature is &quot;Ariel&quot; by José Enrique Rodó (1871–1917). Written in 1900, the book deals with the need to maintain spiritual values while pursuing material and technical progress. Florencio Sánchez (1875–1910) wrote plays about social problems that are still performed today. Juan Zorrilla de San Martín (1855–1931) wrote epic poems about Uruguayan history (notably &quot;Tabaré&quot;). Juana de Ibarbourou (1895–1979) and Delmira Agustini (1866–1914) were also notable poets.

The Generación del 45 (Generation of &#x27;45) were of group of writers, mainly from Uruguay, who were famously known to have an influence on literature and culture of the region. Well-known writers belonged to this group such as Mario Benedetti, Amanda Berenguer, Juan Carlos Onetti, Mauricio Müller, Humberto Megget, Armonía Somers, Idea Vilariño, Emir Rodríguez Monegal, Carlos Maggi, Zenobia Camprubí and among others.

==Religion==

Since 1919, church and state have been separated, and the constitution, as revised in 1966, guarantees religious freedom. The largest religion in Uruguay are the Roman Catholics, making about 66% of the population. Most Uruguayans baptize their children and marry in churches, but don&#x27;t attend church that often. There is an estimated amount of 20,000 Jews in Uruguay, making it one of the largest Jewish communities in South America and in the world. Most Jews in Uruguay are Sephardi Jews, followed by Ashkenazim, Mizrahim, and Italkim. During European migration to South America, many German Jews and Italian Jews migrated to Uruguay. There are also several Evangelical Protestant groups, making 2% of the Uruguayan population. Macumba and Umbanda, religions of Afro-Brazilian origin, are currently the fastest-growing religions in Uruguay. There are a few Christian missionary organizations in Uruguay, such as Serve the City (Run by Matthew Daniels). There is also a number of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, with 11,825 publishers and 156 congregations located within the country.

==Cuisine==

Uruguayans consume a large amount of beef, primarily at gatherings known in the continent as the &quot;asado&quot;. The &quot;parrillada&quot; (beef platter), &quot;chivito&quot; (a substantial steak sandwich), and pasta are the national dishes. Uruguayan cuisine is greatly influenced by Italian cuisine, due to the large number of immigrants who arrived in the country in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Other Uruguayan dishes include &quot;morcilla dulce&quot; (a type of blood sausage cooked with ground orange fruit, orange peel, and walnuts) and &quot;milanesa&quot; (a veal breaded cutlet similar to the German Wienerschnitzel). Snacks include &quot;olímpicos&quot; (club sandwiches), &quot;húngaras&quot; (spicy sausage in a hot dog roll), and &quot;masas surtidas&quot; (bite-sized pastries). Typical drinks include mate, tea, &quot;clericó&quot; (a mixture of white wine and fruit juice), and &quot;medio y medio&quot; (part sparkling wine and part white wine).

===Wine===

Plantings of Tannat (also known in Uruguay as &quot;Harriague&quot;) have been increasing in Uruguay each year as that country&#x27;s wine industry develops, and the country is considered the second most notable Tannat region after Madiran, France. The Tannat wines produced here are characterized by more elegant and softer tannins and blackberry fruit notes. Vineyards in Uruguay have begun to distinguish between the &quot;old vines&quot; that are descendants from the original cuttings brought over from Europe and the new clones being produced today. The newer vines tend to produce more powerful wines with a higher alcohol level, but less acidity and complex fruit characteristics. Some wineries utilize both vines to make blends. Now the wines typically spend about 20 months in oak prior to release. Today it is often blended with Pinot noir and Merlot, and is made in a variety of styles including those reminiscent of Port and Beaujolais.

==Sports==


Sports in Uruguay have been a key element to the culture since the nation&#x27;s independence.

Football (Spanish: &quot;fútbol&quot;) is the most popular sport in Uruguay. Uruguay has won an Olympic gold medal in 1924, and another one in 1928, which were considered the most important tournaments in football, before the FIFA World Cup began in 1930, hence the four stars on the Uruguayan jersey. The first World Cup, which Uruguay won, was held in 1930 in Montevideo. The Estadio Centenario was built for the World Cup, and serves to this day as the country&#x27;s main football stadium.

Uruguay also won the World Cup in 1950, beating Brazil in Rio de Janeiro at the Estádio do Maracanã. The event has had astounding impacts on the history of the sport, due to Brazil being a heavily favoured team at that time, and is also known as the &quot;Maracanazo&quot;.

Uruguay has the second most Copa América titles, the most important football tournament in the South American region. Uruguay currently has 15 titles to their name, the most recent being the 2011 Copa América hosted by Argentina.

Uruguay has two major clubs, Peñarol and Club Nacional de Football, which both have won major tournaments both nationally and internationally. Peñarol has won the Uruguayan Primera División a total of 49 times, while Nacional have won the division 46 times. Peñarol has won the Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious club tournament in South America, 5 times and Nacional have won 3 times. Both teams have won the Intercontinental Cup a total of 3 times (which is the present day FIFA Club World Cup). In September 2009, Peñarol was chosen as the South American Club of the Century by the IFFHS.

Uruguayans are internationally known in the football world and have produced some of the biggest names of the sport. Some names include:

*Enzo Francescoli
*Juan Alberto Schiaffino
*Hector Scarone
*Diego Forlán
*Luis Suárez
*Álvaro Recoba
*Jose Nasazzi
*Diego Godín
*Edinson Cavani

<text>John Henry Schwarz ( ; born November 22, 1941) is an American theoretical physicist. Along with Yoichiro Nambu, Holger Bech Nielsen, Joël Scherk, Gabriele Veneziano, Michael Green, and Leonard Susskind, he is regarded as one of the founders of string theory.

==Early life and education==
He studied mathematics at Harvard College (A.B., 1962) and theoretical physics at the University of California at Berkeley (Ph.D., 1966), where his graduate advisor was Geoffrey Chew.
For several years he was one of the very few physicists who pursued string theory as a viable theory of quantum gravity.

His work with Michael Green on anomaly cancellation in Type I string theories led to the so-called &quot;first superstring revolution&quot; of 1984, which greatly contributed to moving string theory into the mainstream of research in theoretical physics.

Schwarz was an assistant professor at Princeton University from 1966 to 1972. He then moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he is currently the Harold Brown Professor of Theoretical Physics.

==Awards==
He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Physical Society (1986). He was a fellow of the MacArthur Foundation in 1987.

He received the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 1989, and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics of the American Physical Society in 2002. On December 12, 2013, he shared the Fundamental Physics Prize with Michael Green &quot;for opening new perspectives on quantum gravity and the unification of forces.&quot;

<text>Michael Boris Green (born 22 May 1946) is a British physicist and a pioneer of string theory. He is a professor of theoretical physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy at Queen Mary University of London, emeritus professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and a Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge. He was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics from 2009 to 2015.

==Early life and education==
Green was born the son of Genia Green and Absalom Green. He attended William Ellis School in London and Churchill College, Cambridge where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours in theoretical physics (1967) and a PhD in elementary particle theory (1970).

==Career==
Following his PhD, Green did postdoctoral research at Princeton University (1970–72), Cambridge and the University of Oxford. Between 1978 and 1993 he was a Lecturer and Professor at Queen Mary College, University of London, and in July 1993 he was appointed John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. On 19 October 2009 he was confirmed as the next Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, to succeed Stephen Hawking on 1 November 2009. In 2015 was succeeded in that chair by Michael Cates, a specialist in colloids, gels, and particulate materials.

==Research==
After many years in collaboration with John Henry Schwarz, he co-discovered type II string theory in 1982, and later the anomaly cancellation in type I string theory in 1984. This latter insight, named the Green–Schwarz mechanism, initiated the First Superstring Revolution. Green has also worked on Dirichlet boundary conditions in string theory which have led to the postulation of D-branes and instantons.

==Awards and honours==
Green has been awarded the Paul Dirac and Maxwell Medals of the Institute of Physics, UK, the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (Trieste) and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics of the American Physical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1989. Green has co-authored more than 150 research papers.

His nomination for the Royal Society reads

On 12 December 2013, Michael Green shared the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics with John Henry Schwarz &quot;for opening new perspectives on quantum gravity and the unification of forces&quot;.

<doc id="646170" wikidata="Q2915080" url="?curid=646170" title="Stamp Act Congress">
<text>The Stamp Act Congress (October 7 – 25, 1765), also known as the Continental Congress of 1765, was a meeting held in New York City in the colonial Province of New York. It included representatives from most of the British colonies in North America, which sought a unified strategy against newly imposed taxes by the British Parliament, particularly the Stamp Act 1765. It was the second such gathering of elected colonial representatives after the Albany Convention of 1754 at the outbreak of the French and Indian War. Massive debts from that war, which ended in 1763, prompted the British Parliament to implement measures to raise revenues from the colonies. The Stamp Act 1765 required the use of specialty stamped British paper for all legal documents, newspapers, almanacks, and calendars, and even playing cards and dice. When in force, it would have an impact on practically all business in the colonies, starting on November 1, 1765. Resistance to it came especially from lawyers and businessmen, but was broadly protested by ordinary colonial residents. 

Delegates from nine colonies attended the Congress. All of the attending delegations were from the Thirteen Colonies that eventually launched the American Revolution, breaking from British colonial rule to form the United States of America. Although sentiment was strong in some of the other colonies to participate in the Congress, a number of royal governors took steps to prevent the colonial legislatures from meeting to select delegates.

The Congress met in the building where Federal Hall now stands and was held at a time of widespread protests in the colonies, some violent, against the Stamp Act&#x27;s implementation. The delegates discussed and united against the act, issuing a Declaration of Rights and Grievances in which they claimed that Parliament did not have the right to impose the tax because it did not include any representation from the colonies. Members of six of the nine delegations signed petitions addressed to Parliament and King George III objecting to the act&#x27;s provisions.

The extralegal nature of the congress caused alarm in Britain, but any discussion of the congress&#x27;s propriety were overtaken by economic protests from British merchants, whose business with the colonies suffered as a consequence of the protests and their associated non-importation of British products. The economic issues prompted the British Parliament to repeal the Stamp Act 1765, but it passed the Declaratory Act the same day, to express its opinion on the basic constitutional issues raised by the colonists; it stated that Parliament could make laws binding the American colonies &quot;in all cases whatsoever.&quot;

==Background==

In the aftermath of the French and Indian War, the British Parliament sought to increase revenues from its overseas colonies, where the cost of stationing troops had become significant. Parliament first passed the Sugar and Currency Acts in 1764, specifically aimed at raising money for the Crown by tighter regulation of colonial trade. The acts had brought protests from colonial legislatures but had skirted the idea of direct taxation by structuring their revenues as trade-related excise duties. British Prime Minister George Grenville noted at the time of the Sugar Act&#x27;s passage that a stamp tax might also be necessary, immediately raising concern and protest in the colonies.

With the Stamp Act 1765, Parliament attempted to raise money by direct taxation on the colonies for the first time. The act required that all sorts of printed material carry a stamp (purchased from a government agent) to show that the tax had been paid. The use of the stamped paper was required for newspapers, books, court documents, commercial papers, land deeds, almanacs, dice, and playing cards. The revenue was to help finance the operations of the empire, including the cost of stationing troops in the colonies, without seeking revenue through the established colonial assemblies, which had a history of failure.

==Call for Congress==
In June 1765, the Massachusetts Assembly drafted a letter, which was sent to the legislatures of &quot;the several Colonies on this Continent&quot; to &quot;consult together on the present circumstances of the colonies.&quot; Nine of the British America continental colonies ultimately selected delegates to attend the congress: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South Carolina. All of the delegates selected were members of their colonial legislative bodies.

The methods by which delegates were selected were in some cases unorthodox. In Delaware, then known as the &quot;Three Lower Counties&quot; of the Penn proprietors, assembly members held informal meetings in each of the three counties, in each case selecting the same three delegates. In New York, the assembly had been prorogued and was judged unlikely to be summoned by Lieutenant Governor Colden to consider the Massachusetts letter. The assembly&#x27;s committee of correspondence, consisting of its New York City delegates, discussed the letter and decided under the circumstances to assume the authority to represent the colony. New Jersey&#x27;s assembly politely declined to send delegates before adjourning in late June, but after political sentiment against the Stamp Act became more pronounced, Speaker Robert Ogden called an extralegal assembly (since only the governor could officially call it into session) in late September that chose three delegates. Governor William Franklin was upset at the action but took no action beyond protesting the unusual meeting. Maryland&#x27;s assembly, prorogued because of a smallpox outbreak, was finally called into session by Governor Horatio Sharpe to consider the Massachusetts letter on September 23, and delegates were chosen.

The colonies that were not represented at the congress did not send delegates for a variety of reasons. The Virginia and Georgia assemblies were deliberately prevented from meeting by their governors. New Hampshire chose not to send delegates because of an ongoing financial crisis in the colony; by the time some assembly members sought to reconsider that decision, the assembly had adjourned, and Governor Benning Wentworth refused to call it into session. North Carolina Lieutenant Governor William Tryon had prorogued the assembly for other reasons, and there was apparently no action taken to request a special session despite public protests and opposition to the act by Speaker John Ashe. Nova Scotia, which then included present-day Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, declined to send delegates despite significant economic connections to Massachusetts and a strong presence of expatriate New Englanders in its assembly. Dominated by financial interests connected to England, the assembly never even considered a protest resolution against the Stamp Act. Quebec, Newfoundland, and East and West Florida did not have colonial assemblies and were not invited.

When word of the pending congress reached London, the Lords of Trade were so disturbed that they wrote to the king that &quot;this is a matter of the utmost importance to the Kingdom and legislature of Great Britain... and proper only for the consideration of Parliament.&quot; Communications were so slow that when Parliament was informed about its existence, the Stamp Act Congress had become already in session. The trade commissioners also noted that &quot;this appears to us to be the first instance of any General Congress appointed by the Assemblies of the Colonies without the Authority of the Crown, a Measure which we Conceive of dangerous Tendency in itself.&quot;

==Proceedings==
Delegates began to arrive in New York City in late September, and a preliminary meeting was held by four delegations on September 30; what was discussed then is not known. The first session of the Congress was held on October 7, in New York City Hall, now known as Federal Hall. The Congress elected Timothy Ruggles, a conservative Massachusetts delegate, as its chairman, narrowly rejecting James Otis, who John Adams described as &quot;the soul&quot; of the body. John Cotton, the deputy secretary of the Massachusetts General Court, had been retained by the Massachusetts delegation to make a formal record, was chosen as the body&#x27;s secretary and record keeper. The selection of Ruggles as a delegate had been engineered by Massachusetts governor Francis Bernard in the hopes of limiting the effectiveness of the congress. His success in being elected chairman was at least partly because of the perception that Otis, a populist firebrand, &quot;might give their meeting an ill grace.&quot;

The formal sessions of the Stamp Act Congress were conducted behind closed doors although some of its business may have been conducted in informal sessions held in coffeehouses and other establishments in the evenings. Lieutenant Governor Colden, unable to prevent the meeting, called it an illegal convention, noted &quot;Whatever possible pretenses may be used for this meeting their real intentions may be dangerous.&quot; The delegates were clear that they were in fact loyal to the Crown. New York delegate Robert Livingston wrote that the Congress was designed to insure the unity of the British Empire: &quot;if I really wished to see America in a state of independence, I should desire as one of the most effectual means to that end that the stamp act should be inforced.&quot;

Little is known of the debates in the Congress. The official congressional journal, in an apparently deliberate move, contained only brief details of official actions, and only William Samuel Johnson of the participants kept a private journal. As a result, accounts of the Congress are based on fragmentary records from contemporary letters and publications. In addition to selecting officers, the first sessions examined the credentials of each of the delegations; despite the unorthodox methods by which some were chosen, no delegates were rejected. They also debated on how voting in the body should take place, eventually agreeing that each delegation would cast a single vote.

The early substantive debates centered around issues raised by the Stamp Act and the earlier Sugar Act. The delegates spent a significant amount of time discussing the differences between direct (&quot;internal&quot;) taxation and the regulation of trade (or &quot;external taxation&quot;), and seeking formal justification of the idea that only the colonial assemblies had the right to levy internal taxes. Fairly early in the deliberations, the delegates agreed to produce a statement of rights which would form the foundation for petitions the congress would submit to Parliament and the king. According to Delaware delegate Caesar Rodney, the drafting of the statement was made difficult by the desire to balance the colonists&#x27; rights with the royal prerogative and the acknowledged powers of Parliament.

On October 19, the delegates adopted the Declaration of Rights and Grievances, a document intended primarily for local political discussion. Over the next few days, separate committees drafted three documents: an &quot;address&quot; to the king, a &quot;memorial&quot; to the House of Lords, and a &quot;petition&quot; to the House of Commons. Separate committees worked over the next few days to draft these, which were accepted after debate and revision by the delegates on October 22 and 23. When the issue of signing the documents was discussed on October 24, matters suddenly became more complicated. The delegations from Connecticut and South Carolina refused to sign the documents, citing their instructions specifically denying such power. New York&#x27;s delegation also refused, citing the informality with which it had been selected. From the other six delegations, New Jersey&#x27;s Robert Ogden and Massachusetts&#x27; Ruggles both refused to sign, sparking a heated argument. Ruggles eventually moved that no one sign the documents, and that they instead be sent unsigned to the colonial assemblies. Otis pointed out that the Massachusetts assembly had authorized its delegation to sign any jointly agreed documents and that Ruggles&#x27; suggestion undermined the purpose of the congress to present a united front.

Although the other delegates from the six colonies signed the petitions, Ruggles and Ogden did not, and both were called before their respective assemblies to justify their actions. Ruggles, in his defense, admitted that he was opposed to the substance of the documents, and Ogden argued weakly that he thought separate petitions would be more effective than a joint one. (Others noted that Parliament had already ignored such petitions.) Ruggles and Thomas McKean had an angry exchange over the matter, resulting in Ruggles challenging McKean to a duel. The duel did not take place, and Ruggles left New York early the next morning. The congress met again on October 25, when the petitions were signed, and arrangements were made for the transmission of some of the documents to England, and the making of copies for the nonparticipating colonies.

==Declaration and petitions==

The Declaration of Rights contains fourteen statements. The first six lay groundwork, proclaiming loyalty to the crown and asserting that according to the Rights of Englishmen and the more general &quot;freedom of a people&quot;, only representatives chosen by the colonists could levy taxes. Because Parliament did not have such representatives, it could not levy taxes. The seventh statement asserts that the Rights of Englishmen afford all colonists the right to trial by jury. The remaining statements protest the unconstitutionality of the Stamp Act; express the economic consequences, which, among other things, would reduce trade to the detriment of English manufacturers; and reiterated the rights of the colonists to petition the crown and Parliament.

The petitions directed to the House of Lords and the king were written in flattering tones, gently stating the liberties the colonists had enjoyed as British subjects and hoping they would retain them. The petition to the Lords specifically acknowledged &quot;due Subordination to that August Body the British Parliament.&quot; In contrast, the petition addressed to the House of Commons was more detailed, advancing economic arguments against the Stamp Act and requesting the repeal of legislation creating a jury-less vice admiralty court at Halifax. It also reiterated the supremacy of Parliament.

==Reaction==
Copies of the petitions left New York City on two ships, one of which had arrived during the Congress, carrying stamped paper.Lord Dartmouth, the colonial secretary, rejected the petition to the Lords, saying it was an inappropriate document. The House of Commons cited several reasons not to consider the petition, including that it had been submitted by an unconstitutional assembly, it denied Parliament&#x27;s right to levy taxes, and acceptance of the petition would constitute an admission that Parliament had erred. The weak Rockingham Ministry, laboring for support against political opponents, rallied merchant interests in opposition to the Stamp Act, and it was repealed primarily on the strength of economic arguments advanced by these interests on March 18, 1766. To address the constitutional issues raised by the North American protests, Parliament also passed the Declaratory Act, claiming the authority to legislate for the colonies &quot;in all cases whatsoever&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Stamp Act Congress is generally viewed as one of the first organized and coordinated political actions of the American Revolution, though its participants were not at all yet focused on independence from Great Britain. Despite significant political differences and disagreements between the Thirteen Colonies, tensions occasioned by the harsh Parliamentary response to the 1773 Boston Tea Party prompted the calling of the First Continental Congress, which produced a united response to the Intolerable Acts of 1774. Colonies, including those in Quebec and Nova Scotia, had only moderate opposition to the Stamp Act, continued to act moderately through the rising protests and largely remained Loyalists during the American Revolutionary War, which commenced on April 19, 1775 at the Battles of Lexington and Concord and escalated substantially following the July 4, 1776 unanimous adoption of the Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia.

Most of the official papers of the Congress have not survived. One copy of its journal, from the papers of Caesar Rodney, survives in the library at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey, and a second exists in the Connecticut state archives. The Maryland copy of the journal, although the original is lost, was transcribed into its assembly&#x27;s records and printed in 1766. Inconsistencies within and between the documents make it uncertain whether any is an accurate representation of the official journal (which was probably taken to Massachusetts and was not located by Weslager in his research).

==Delegates==
Jacob Kollock was also selected to represent the Delaware counties and is known to have traveled to New York, but there is no record of his attendance at the Congress&#x27;s official sessions. Joseph Fox, speaker of the Pennsylvania assembly, was also chosen as a delegate but decided not to attend because conditions in Pennsylvania required his presence there. Samuel Adams is often mistakenly listed as a delegate, but he is not on the list of delegates.

Timothy Ruggles served as chairman (president) of the Stamp Act Congress. John Cotton, who was not a delegate, served as secretary.

<text>Elisabeth DelPadre Hasselbeck (; born May 28, 1977) is an American television personality and talk show host. She rose to prominence in 2001 as a contestant on the of the American version of &quot;Survivor&quot;, where she finished in fourth place. She married NFL player Tim Hasselbeck the following year.

From 2003 to 2013, Hasselbeck appeared as a co-host on the ABC daytime talk show &quot;The View&quot;, where she became known for her conservative views on sociopolitical issues. With her co-hosts Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, Sherri Shepherd, and Barbara Walters, she was awarded the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host during the 36th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2009. Thereafter, Hasselbeck was a co-host on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; from 2013 to 2015.

==Early life and education==
Hasselbeck was born Elisabeth DelPadre Filarski on May 28, 1977, in Cranston, Rhode Island. She is the daughter of architect Kenneth Filarski and school teacher and lawyer Elizabeth DelPadre. Her brother, Kenneth Jr., is a practicing attorney. Their father is of Polish descent and their mother is of Italian descent.

Hasselbeck was raised Catholic and attended St. Mary School in Cranston, followed by St. Mary Academy – Bay View in East Providence, where she graduated in 1995. She then attended Boston College, where she captained the women&#x27;s softball team for two seasons, winning consecutive Big East championships. With concentrations on large scale paintings and industrial design, Hasselbeck graduated with a BFA in 1999. Hasselbeck started working for Puma in 1998, while attending Boston College. After graduation, she worked for Puma shoes as a member of its design team before her television career.

==&quot;Survivor&quot;==
===&quot;The Australian Outback&quot;===

In 2001, Hasselbeck (then Elisabeth Filarski) was cast in &quot;&quot;, and was originally a member of the Kucha tribe alongside Rodger Bingham, Nick Brown, Alicia Calaway, Debb Eaton, Kimmi Kappenberg, Michael Skupin, and Jeff Varner.

Filarski took on a &#x27;cheerleader&#x27; role in the tribe, which made many people like her, particularly Bingham as the two formed a close friendship. Filarski avoided being voted out at the first Tribal Council, which her tribe attended. The Kucha tribe then went on a winning streak and lost once again on day fifteen. They voted out Kappenberg. On day seventeen, Skupin fell into the campfire and had to be medically evacuated. 

Skupin&#x27;s evacuation led to the Kucha and Ogakor tribes merging. There were five members each. Filarski lasted almost nine hours in the first individual immunity challenge. Contestants had to stand on a perch in the water for as long as possible, but lost. At the first tribal council, former Kucha member Varner was eliminated in a 5–5 tie. This was due to previous votes cast against him. This led to another Kucha member Alicia being voted out and sent to the jury.

Filarski was next on the block when the biggest threat in her original tribe, Brown, won immunity. She swayed the votes of Ogakor members Tina Wesson and Colby Donaldson her way, and had Jerri Manthey voted out. However the former Ogakor would continue dominating the game when they voted out Brown at the final seven, but she and Bingham managed to survive once again after she convinced the Ogakor alliance to vote out their own member Amber Brkich.

At the final five, her closest ally throughout the entire game, Rodger Bingham, was voted out. She then became the sole remaining Kucha member and was voted out next on day 39, receiving fourth place and becoming the sixth jury member. 

At the final tribal council, Filarski voted for Wesson to win over Donaldson. Wesson went on to win the season in a 4–3 vote.

===Post-show===
She was one of two people who were asked to return for &quot;&quot; and declined, the other being Colleen Haskell of &quot;.&quot;

==Television career==
Hasselbeck was a judge at the Miss Teen USA 2001 pageant. From 2002 to 2003, she hosted the Style Network&#x27;s &quot;The Look for Less&quot; where she helped find stylish clothes for bargain prices.

===2003–13: &quot;The View&quot;===

Although Hasselbeck previously saw herself as a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; kind of person and not interested in a career in television, or playing pundit, her agent was eager to showcase her competitive client and she auditioned for &quot;The View&quot; in 2003. Hasselbeck was one of a number of women who guest-hosted to replace outgoing &quot;The View&quot; co-host Lisa Ling, who left the show at the end of 2002. She became a permanent co-host on November 24, 2003.

Hasselbeck typically represented the conservative position on &quot;The View&quot;.

On August 2, 2006, Hasselbeck got into a heated debate in which she strongly opposed the Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s plan to sell the &quot;morning-after pill&quot; as an over-the-counter drug. Hasselbeck stated, &quot;I believe that life begins at the moment of conception.&quot; She said the over-the-counter distribution of the pill should be banned even in cases of rape and incest, because &quot;life still has value.&quot; Hasselbeck argued that advocates of the drug use the &quot;rape or incest&quot; exception as a &quot;bait-and-switch&quot; distraction from the goal of making it universally accessible. She argued that if the &quot;rape or incest&quot; exception were all advocates cared about, they would not support its over-the-counter status. On air, moderator Barbara Walters advised Hasselbeck to calm down after she became emotional about the topic. When the live show went to a commercial break, Hasselbeck ripped up her cue cards and stormed off the set. In an expletive-laden off-air conversation picked up on a live mic, Hasselbeck explained to co-host Joy Behar that she did not appreciate being reprimanded on live TV by Walters for being passionate about the topic. She threatened to quit, but producer Bill Geddie convinced her to come back to the set. As the show came back from the break, Walters and Elisabeth appeared together on a couch, awkwardly making up for the situation. Hasselbeck hugged Walters, sat on her lap, and ended up backing off from her threat to quit.

On May 23, 2007, Hasselbeck was involved in a heated on-air argument with co-host Rosie O&#x27;Donnell concerning the war in Iraq, which she supported and O&#x27;Donnell opposed. When O&#x27;Donnell asked, &quot;655,000 Iraqi civilians dead. Who are the terrorists?&quot; O&#x27;Donnell was criticized by conservative commentators (including Fox News anchor Bill O&#x27;Reilly) for her question and she (O&#x27;Donnell) complained about Hasselbeck&#x27;s unwillingness to defend O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s statements in the controversy that followed. Hasselbeck responded &quot;defend your own insinuations,&quot; adding that she should not have to defend anyone else&#x27;s words for them, especially when that person has a forum in which to present a defense.
In August 2009, Hasselbeck, along with her co-hosts Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd, and Barbara Walters, won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host. It follows over a decade of nominations for &quot;The View&quot; with no win. None of the co-hosts of the show was in Los Angeles to collect the award. For the first time, the show had not been nominated for both Outstanding Talk Show and Outstanding Talk Show Host.

On March 8, 2013, there were widespread media reports that Hasselbeck was going to be fired from the show, effective at the end of the season, allegedly because of market research polling that showed viewers thought her views were too conservative. However, on the March 11, 2013, episode of the show, Walters said that the rumors were &quot;particularly false&quot; and that there are &quot;no plans for Elisabeth to leave this show&quot;.

On July 9, 2013, ABC confirmed that Hasselbeck would be leaving &quot;The View&quot; to join &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;. Her last day on &quot;The View&quot; was on July 10, 2013.

Since departing, Hasselbeck returned on May 15, 2014, along with other former co-hosts to celebrate Barbara Walters&#x27; retirement. She returned to the show as a guest on March 26, 2019, where she confirmed for the first time that she had been fired in 2013. On March 11, 2020, Hasselbeck served as a guest co-host. She also returned in August 2022 as a guest-co-host, as part of the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary season, in which former hosts made return appearances.

On September 16, 2013, Hasselbeck joined the Fox News morning show, &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; as a co-host, replacing Gretchen Carlson. By that November, the show&#x27;s ratings had grown by 9 percent, and increased 10 percent in viewership among people ages 25–54. In November 2015, Hasselbeck announced that she would retire and leave &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; at the end of the year in order to spend more time with her family, saying she wanted to &quot;give them the best of me, not the rest of me&quot;. Her final day with Fox News was on December 22, 2015.

==Personal life==
On July 6, 2002, Hasselbeck married her college boyfriend, professional football quarterback Tim Hasselbeck. They have a daughter, Grace Elisabeth (born in 2005), and two sons, Taylor Thomas (born in 2007), and Isaiah Timothy (born in 2009).

Hasselbeck is a Christian, and in August 2014, she condemned the persecution of Christians in Iraq, as well as the removal of Bibles from hotel rooms in the United States. Despite her parents being liberals, Hasselbeck is a Republican. She was a speaker at the Republican National Conventions in both 2004 and 2008. On October 26, 2008, Hasselbeck appeared at Republican rallies in Florida, introducing vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

Hasselbeck is a supporter of breast cancer awareness initiatives in the form of an Internet-only PSA on breast cancer diagnosis.

===Celiac disease===
Hasselbeck has celiac disease. She has written a book on the subject, &quot;The G-Free Diet: A Gluten-Free Survival Guide&quot;, which has appeared on several best-seller lists. On June 23, 2009, a lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Massachusetts alleging that her book was plagiarized from a self-published book by Susan Hasset. Hasselbeck released a statement calling the allegations baseless. The lawsuit was dismissed in November 2009 when the plaintiff&#x27;s lawyer declined to pursue it, saying to the press that he believed some degree of plagiarism occurred, but it was not sufficient to justify monetary damages. In 2011, Hasselbeck introduced NoGii, her line of gluten-free nutritional products for children and adults.

<text>The Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES //) is a program of shared educational services provided to school districts by the New York State Legislature.

==History==
BOCES owes its origin to a state legislative enactment authorizing the formation of intermediate school districts. Passed in 1948, the act was aimed at enabling small rural school districts to combine their resources to provide services that otherwise would have been uneconomical, inefficient, or unavailable.

BOCES was to be the temporary means by which careful transitions could be made to an intermediate district framework. Though its purposes were similar to those of the proposed intermediate districts, BOCES was conceived and written into the Education Law in its own separate sections (1950 and 1951). Simpler in structure and less autonomous than projected intermediate districts, the BOCES proved itself worthy of being both means and end. Not one intermediate district was ever formed, and cooperative boards proliferated rapidly, especially during the mid-1950s, reaching 82 by 1958.

In 1972 the Intermediate School District Act was repealed. Laws pertaining to BOCES, however, have remained on the books. Thus BOCES has developed from a special-purpose, interim agency into a formally recognized middle or intermediate unit in New York State&#x27;s public education system. There are currently 37 BOCES incorporating all but 9 of the 697 school districts in New York State.

Moreover, other states have moved toward regional educational configurations like BOCES. At least 30 state legislatures have mandated or passed legislation, as educational service agencies study the idea.

==Membership==
The total area under supervision of a district superintendent is called a supervisory district.

BOCES membership is not available to the so-called &quot;Big Five&quot; city school districts: New York City, Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers, and Syracuse.

Once a district has joined a BOCES, it cannot withdraw and is obligated to pay its annual share of administrative, rental, or facilities expenses. BOCES services are, however, optional. They may be purchased or not purchased as the district&#x27;s Board of Education (BOE) sees fit. The decision to purchase or not purchase BOCES services is made each school year by district BOEs.

==Operations==
BOCES services are created when two or more school districts decide they have similar needs that can be met by a shared program. BOCES helps school districts save money by providing opportunities to pool resources and share costs.

Sharing is an economical way for districts to provide programs and services that they might not be able to afford otherwise. It is often more efficient and less costly to operate one central service than it is to have separate programs in each school district. BOCES services are often customized offering districts the flexibility to meet their individual needs.

BOCES is governed just as local districts are governed by a Board of Education, which is made up of representatives from component districts. Board members are responsible for curricular, financial, and other policy decisions, just as they are at the local level.

Members are elected by component school board members. BOCES board members do not need to be local school board members, but they must be eligible voters in component school districts of that BOCES.

Election to BOCES boards occurs at an annual BOCES meeting, which by law is held in April.

The duties and powers of BOCES boards, as specified in 1950 of the Education Law of the State of New York, include the following:
* Appointment of a district superintendent, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Education;
* Provision of cooperative educational services—with the commissioner&#x27;s approval and on a contract basis—to component school districts;
* Needs assessment and long-range planning for cooperative educational services in the supervisory district;
* Employment of teachers and other support personnel to carry out BOCES programs;
* Preparation of an adjustable budget for the supervisory district program and its administration;
* Administration of payments for and costs of provided educational services;
* Borrowing of money in anticipation of revenue due;
* Entering into contracts with a variety of public agencies as well as non-public schools in order to arrange or provide services under specified conditions;
* Renting, purchasing, or selling of property or facilities under specified conditions;
* Making reports to the commissioner of education as required.

===District Superintendent===
A BOCES board appoints its own chief executive officer, contingent upon approval of the commissioner of education. As a BOCES executive, the district superintendent serves local districts and is responsible to the board of education representing the component districts of the BOCES.

The district superintendent also serves as a representative of the commissioner of education, providing educational leadership to local school districts in matters of law, policy, and practice.

Based on these responsibilities, the district superintendent has at least three important roles:

* Educational change agent
* Regional planner and coordinator
* Field representative for the New York State Education Department, a consultative capacity designed to improve two-way communication between state and local levels

==Services==

===Structure and procedures for providing services===
The facilities, professional personnel, and services of a BOCES are available to every local school district within the district superintendent&#x27;s supervisory district. Because the BOCES board must develop its offerings to fulfill local demands and needs, levels of accountability and flexibility are maintained.

Under New York State Education Law, a BOCES must furnish any educational service that is requested by two or more component districts and approved by the commissioner of education according to need and practicality in a regional context.

By January of each year, the Boards of Education in component school districts specify their potential service needs for the following school year. These needs, developed by the BOCES into annual operating plans, are submitted to the New York State Education Department and the commissioner of education for approval. BOCES boards then notify component districts of the approved services, asking for a firm commitment to participate by May 1 of each year.

The BOCES and the component districts then enter into formal contracts. Specified in each contract are the number and types of services to be furnished by the BOCES, the number of people to be served, and the amount to be paid to the BOCES.

Signed by the BOCES and component board presidents, and then approved by the commissioner, these contracts are effective for one year, after which they may be renewed, changed, or canceled at the component districts&#x27; option. Because districts&#x27; needs change every year, decisions about BOCES services may also change every year. If the district doesn&#x27;t need a BOCES service, it doesn&#x27;t request it and it doesn&#x27;t pay for it.

Districts may also authorize multi-year service requests from BOCES.

===Reasons for participation===
Because BOCES services are shared by two or more school districts, they often cost much less than if districts provided the services on their own. Districts pool their resources and share the savings.

In addition, New York State gives a financial incentive to participate in shared services by offering school districts state aid for BOCES services. Here is how BOCES state aid works:

:* Each district&#x27;s Board of Education selects BOCES services for the current year.
:* The following school year, a portion of the cost of BOCES services is returned to the district as BOCES aid.
:* The amount returned is based on a formula that takes into account the districts&#x27; financial resources.
:* Money not spent on a cooperative service is returned to the district at the end of each fiscal year by the BOCES.

===Funding===
A BOCES has no taxing authority. Instead, the sources of BOCES funds are primarily taxes levied by its component districts, state aid, and a relatively small amount of federal aid.

These funds support an administrative budget (covering administrative salaries, equipment, and services) and a program budget (covering other BOCES programs and services which districts select from the Service Directory, an annual listing of available services). In addition, BOCES may receive and manage funding from outside sources (e.g., state and federal) to cover special projects.

The component district&#x27;s share of BOCES administrative, lease and capital costs are based either on the Resident Weighted Average Daily Attendance (RWADA) or on real property valuation.

Program costs are proportional to the amount of use each component district requires.

Through BOCES state aid, component districts receive financial support for their participation in BOCES. The cost charged to a component district for its BOCES participation serves as the basis for the district&#x27;s BOCES state aid.

===Programs===
The programs and services offered by each BOCES may vary somewhat, and are developed based on the needs of a given BOCES&#x27; local school districts.

A large percentage of BOCES programs and services are instructional; that is to say, they serve students with classroom programs and services. Examples of instructional programs are vocational-technical programs for high school students, physical, speech and occupational therapy for students with disabilities, and literacy programs for adults.

Often support staff are broken into on-site, related, or itinerant staff positions. Related personnel often support the program and are housed at the on-site location while Itinerant staff provide services to component districts on an individual or case-by-case basis.

The remaining programs are called support services. They are not classroom programs, support services still relate to the education of students, and because they help school districts save money. This frees up resources to better serve students directly. Examples of support services are staff development, central bus maintenance, central business offices, and Regional Information Centers.

An example of programs that BOCES might offer are Academics Support, Auto Body Repair, Auto Technology, Aviation, Aviation Mechanical Technician, Building Maintenance, Business Computer Technology, Carpentry, Computer Repair and Networking, Cosmetology, Criminal Justice, Culinary Arts, Early Childhood Education, Electrical Wiring Technology, Forestry &amp; Conservation, Gas/Diesel Mechanics, Life Skills, Medical Careers, New Vision Health, New Visions: Law &amp; Government, Nursing Assistant, Practical Nursing, Small Animal Care, Welding, and Visual Communications.

<text>In generative linguistics, Distributed Morphology is a theoretical framework introduced in 1993 by Morris Halle and Alec Marantz. The central claim of Distributed Morphology is that there is no divide between the construction of words and sentences. The syntax is the single generative engine that forms sound-meaning correspondences, both complex phrases and complex words. This approach challenges the traditional notion of the Lexicon as the unit where derived words are formed and idiosyncratic word-meaning correspondences are stored. In Distributed Morphology there is no unified Lexicon as in earlier generative treatments of word-formation. Rather, the functions that other theories ascribe to the Lexicon are distributed among other components of the grammar.

==Overview of Distributed Morphology==
The basic principle of Distributed Morphology is that there is a single generative engine for the formation of both complex words and complex phrases: there is no division between syntax and morphology and there is no Lexicon in the sense it has in traditional generative grammar. Distributed Morphology rejects the notion of a lexicon in the way it had been used. Any operation that would occur in the &#x27;lexicon&#x27; according to lexicalist approaches is considered too vague in Distributed Morphology, which instead distributes these operations over various steps and lists.
The term Distributed Morphology is used because the morphology of an utterance is the product of operations distributed over more than one step, with content from more than one list. In contrast to lexicalist models of morphosyntax, Distributed Morphology posits three components in building an utterance:
# The Formative List provides the input for syntax.
# The Exponent List (the list of Vocabulary Items) is consulted to provide the utterance with post-syntactic phonological content.
# Syntactic operations (such as Merge, Move or Agree in the Minimalist framework) apply to formatives.

There are three relevant lists in Distributed Morphology: the Formative List, the Exponent List (Vocabulary Items), and the Encyclopedia. Items from these lists enter the derivation at different stages.

===Formative list: category-neutral roots===
The formative list, sometimes called the lexicon (this term will be avoided here) in Distributed Morphology includes all the bundles of semantic and sometimes syntactic features that can enter the syntactic computation. These are interpretable or uninterpretable features (such as [+/- animate], [+/- count], etc.) which are manipulated in syntax through syntactic operations. These bundles of features do not have any phonological content; phonological content is assigned to them only at spell-out, that is after all syntactic operations are over. The Formative List in Distributed Morphology differs, thus, from the Lexicon in traditional generative grammar, which includes the lexical items (such as words and morphemes) in a language.

As its name would suggest, the Formative List contains what are known as formatives, or roots. In Distributed Morphology, roots are proposed to be category-neutral and undergo categorization by functional elements. Roots have no grammatical categories in and of themselves, and merely represent the bundle of semantic features to be exponed. The notation for roots in Distributed Morphology generally uses a square root symbol, with an arbitrary number or with the orthographic representation of the root. For example, &quot;love&quot;, without a grammatical category, could be expressed as √362 or as √LOVE.

Researchers adopting the Distributed Morphology approach agree that roots must be categorized by functional elements. There are multiple ways that this can be done. The following lists four possible routes.
# Roots are merged as complements to the functional elements that categorize them.
# Roots are merged as modifiers to the functional elements that categorize them.
# Some roots are merged as modifiers and others as complements to the function elements that categorize them.
# Roots are inserted post-syntactically and do not merge with complements or modifiers.
As of 2020, there is no consensus on which approach most accurately describes the structural configuration of root categorization.

===Exponent list: vocabulary items===
Vocabulary items associate phonological content with arrays of underspecified syntactic and/or semantic features – the features listed in the Lexicon – and they are the closest notion to the traditional morpheme known from generative grammar. Postsyntactic Morphology posits that this operation takes place after the syntax itself has occurred.

Vocabulary items are also known as the Exponent List. In Distributed Morphology, after the syntax of a given utterance is complete, the Exponent List must be consulted to provide phonological content. This is known as &#x27;exponing&#x27; an item. In other words, a vocabulary item is a relation between a phonological string (which could also be zero or null) and the context in which this string may be inserted. Vocabulary items compete for insertion to syntactic nodes at spell-out, i.e. after syntactic operations are complete. The following is an example of a vocabulary item in Distributed Morphology:

An affix in Russian can be exponed as follows:

/n/ &lt;--&gt; [___, +participant +speaker, plural] 
The phonological string on the left side is available for insertion to a node with the features described on the right side.

Roots, i.e. formatives from the Formative List, are exponed based on their features. For example, the first-person singular pronominal paradigm in English is exponed as follows:

[+1 +sing +nom +prn] ←→ /aj/
[+1 +sing +prn] ←→ /mi/

The use of /mi/ does not seem infelicitous in a nominative context at first glance. If /mi/ acquired nominative case in the syntax, it would seem appropriate to use it. However, /aj/ is specified for the feature [+nom], and therefore must block the use of /mi/ in a nominative context. This is known as the Maximal Subset Condition or the Elsewhere Principle: if two items have a similar set of features, the one that is more specific will win. Illustrated in logical notation:

f(E1) ⊂ f(T), f(E2) ⊂ f(T), and f(E1) ⊂ f(E2) → f(E2) wins.

In this case, both /mi/ and /aj/ have a subset of features f(T), but /aj/ has the maximal subset.

===Encyclopedia===

The Encyclopedia associates syntactic units with special, non-compositional aspects of meaning. This list specifies interpretive operations that realize in a semantic sense the terminal nodes of a complete syntactic derivation. For example, adjectives &quot;compárable&quot; and &quot;cómparable&quot; are thought to represent two different structures. First one, has a composition meaning of ‘being able to compare’ – root combines with a categorizer V- and the two combine with the suffix &quot;–able&quot;. The second one has an idiomatic meaning of ‘equal’ taken directly from the Encyclopedia – here root combines directly with the suffix &quot;–able&quot;.

===Derivation===

The Y-model of Minimalism, as well as the syntactic operations postulated in Minimalism, are preserved in Distributed Morphology. The derivation of a phrase/word proceeds as follows:

# A subset of the Lexicon, i.e. some combination of interpretable and uninterpretable features, and category-neutral lexical roots (e.g. √CAT) enter the computation. These features specify structural relations, which are satisfied via the operation of syntactic operations, such as Merge, Move or Agree. For example, if node A has a [+ plural] feature, while node B has no value assigned to the feature [plural], then node B could become [+plural] if it is in the right configuration with node A for Agree to apply. The category-neutral roots combine with a categorizer e.g., N-, A-, V- and turn into a respective category noun, adjective or verb. Once all relations specified by the features present in the numeration are satisfied, the syntactic derivation is complete; there is a configuration of terminal nodes, with different combinations of features and their values, and roots but without phonological content assigned to these nodes. At spell-out, the traditional division to logical form (LF) and phonetic form (PF) of the Y-model takes place. 
# At LF, the Encyclopedia is responsible for the semantic interpretation of the terminal nodes. Any non-compositional and idiosyncratic meaning associated with the bundles of features and lexical roots present at the end of the syntactic computation is assigned at this stage. 
# After syntactic operations are complete, certain morphological operations (see below) apply before any assignment of phonological content to the terminal nodes.
# Once these morphological operations are complete, phonological content is finally assigned to the terminal nodes, through competition of vocabulary items for insertion. How does competition work? Each terminal node contains a bundle of features and all vocabulary items compete for insertion into the terminal nodes. The vocabulary item that wins the competition and is inserted in a certain terminal node is the item that is most highly specified for that node. For example, if at the end of the derivation there is a terminal node with the features [+past, + plural, +3rd person] and the lexical root √PLAY, then the phonological content that will be assigned to the node will be the one corresponding to &quot;played&quot; because the most highly specified vocabulary item for this node is the item /d/ &lt;--&gt; [___, +past, plural, 3rd person]. It is important to note that this vocabulary item does not exactly match the features of the terminal node; however, it wins the competition because in English it is the most highly specified vocabulary item for the specific values of features present in the node. Competition for insertion is governed by the Subset Principle, the following version of which is from Halle (1997):
:&quot;The phonological exponent of a Vocabulary Item is inserted into a morpheme in the terminal string if the item matches all or a subset of the grammatical features specified in the terminal morpheme. Insertion does not take place if the Vocabulary item contains features not present in the morpheme. Where several Vocabulary items meet the conditions for insertion, the item matching the greatest number of features specified in the terminal morpheme must be chosen.&quot;

==Morphological operations==

Distributed Morphology recognizes a number of morphology-specific operations that occur post-syntactically. There is no consensus about the order of application of these morphological operations with respect to vocabulary insertion, and it is generally believed that certain operations apply before vocabulary insertion, while others apply to the vocabulary items themselves. For example, Embick and Noyer (2001) argue that Lowering applies before Vocabulary insertion, while Local Dislocation applies afterwards.

Apart from the operations described above, some researchers (Embick 1997 among others) have suggested that there are morphemes that represent purely formal features and are inserted post-syntactically but before spell-out: these morphemes are called &quot;dissociated morphemes&quot;.

===Morphological merger===

Morphological Merger is generalized as follows in Marantz 1988: 261:

Morphological Merger:

&quot;At any level of syntactic analysis (d-structure, s-structure, phonological structure), a relation between X and Y may be replaced by (expressed by) the affixation of the lexical head of X to the lexical head of Y.&quot;

Two syntactic nodes can undergo Morphological Merger subject to morphophonological well-formedness conditions.

====Many-to-one mapping between syntax and morphology: feature fusion====

Two nodes that have undergone Morphological Merger or that have been adjoined through syntactic head movement can undergo Fusion, yielding one single node for Vocabulary insertion. Many-to-one relation where two syntactic terminals are realized as a single exponent (portmanteau).

An example can be found in Swahili, which has separate exponents for subject agreement (e.g., 1st plural &quot;tu-&quot;) and negation (&quot;ha-&quot;):

However, 1st person singular exponent &quot;ni-&quot; and negation &quot;ha-&quot; undergo fusion and realized as &quot;si-&quot;:

An alternative analysis of &quot;si-&quot; exponent says that there is no fusion but rather context sensitive allomorphy:

===Fission===

Fission refers to the splitting of one terminal node into two distinct terminal nodes prior to Vocabulary Insertion. Some of the most well-known cases of fission involve the imperfect conjugations of Semitic, in which agreement morphology is split into a prefixal and suffixal part, as investigated in the work of Noyer (1992). Fission may also occur where insertion of a Vocabulary item discharges the intrinsic features of the Vocabulary item from the terminal node, leaving others features available for possible insertion; if fission applies, then other Vocabulary items can be inserted to discharge the remaining features. When Fission occurs, the order of morphemes is influenced by the featural complexity of Vocabulary items.

===Feature impoverishment===
Impoverishment (a term introduced into the theory in Bonet 1991) refers to a change in the feature content on a terminal node prior to Vocabulary Insertion, resulting in a less marked feature content.
* Feature deletion: This is accomplished by deleting a feature or by changing it from a marked to an unmarked value (e.g. [+plural] to [-plural]). Impoverishment accounts for cases in which spell-out of a terminal node by a featurally specific Vocabulary Item is blocked by a less specific Vocabulary Item.
* Feature obliteration: Impoverishment can target an entire terminal node (rather than just one of its features), in which case it is referred to as &#x27;obliteration&#x27;. This results in the complete absence of the morpheme from the structure of the word.

===Lowering===

Lowering is sensitive to syntactic headedness and operates on abstract feature bundles, after syntactic movement but prior to vocabulary insertion. Lowering takes place when a head X lowers to the head of its complement, Y. For example, T in English (e.g. +past) lowers to be realized on the head of its complement V, as in &quot;John [TP tT [vP play-ed piano]].&quot; An adjoined adverb will not block this syntactic movement, since it is sensitive to syntactic headedness rather than linear adjacency: &quot;John skillfully play-ed piano.&quot; On the other hand, a Merged Negation head will block this movement and trigger &#x27;do insertion&#x27;:&quot; John did not play piano&quot; (Embick &amp; Noyer 2001:564).

===Local dislocation===

String-adjacent Vocabulary items may undergo Local Dislocation, in which the two items form a unit, with reversed linear order. Embick and Noyer (2001) suggest that linearization takes place at Vocabulary Insertion. At this point it is possible to reorder linearly adjacent vocabulary items. This reordering must respect the relationship between the constituents, however. In a linearization [X [Z*Y]], X can undergo Local Dislocation to give the linearization: Z°Z+X]*Y, since Z is still left-adjacent to Y though Z is now an internally complex head (Embick &amp; Noyer 2001:563). The relationship between X and Z has been properly converted through Local Dislocation. Since the relationships between the constituents have been respected or properly converted, the derivation is well-formed. Local Dislocation applies after Vocabulary insertion to reorder two linearly adjacent elements, such as the comparative feature and an adjective in &quot;John is smarter than Mary.&quot;, which contrasts with &quot;John is more intelligent than Mary.&quot;; in this case the movement makes reference to the phonological features of the moved items, moving &quot;-er&quot; after an adjective of one syllable, while leaving &quot;more&quot; in a position dominating the adjective (Embick &amp; Noyer 2001:564).

==Distributed morphology approach to core theoretical issues==

===Morpheme order===

In Distributed Morphology, the linear order of morphemes is determined by their hierarchical position in the syntactic structure, as well as by certain post-syntactic operations. Head movement is the main syntactic operation determining morpheme order, while Morphological Merger (or Merger under Adjacency) is the main post-syntactic operation targeting affix order. Other post-syntactic operations that might affect morpheme order are Lowering and Local Dislocation (see previous section for details on these operations).

====Head movement====
Head movement is subject to the Head Movement Constraint, according to which when a head moves, it cannot skip an intervening head. Left adjunction and the Head Movement Constraint ensure that the Mirror Principle holds. The syntactic mechanism responsible for the effects of the Mirror Principle is head movement: heads raise and left-adjoin to higher heads. The general principle behind morpheme order is the Mirror Principle (first formulated by Baker 1985), according to which the linear order of morphemes is the mirror image of the hierarchy of syntactic projections. For example, in a plural noun like &quot;cat-s&quot;, the plural morpheme is higher in the hierarchy than the noun: [NumP -s[NP cat]]. The Mirror Principle dictates that the linear order of the plural morpheme with respect to the noun should be the mirror image of their hierarchy, namely the attested &quot;cat-s&quot;. 
Research subsequent to Baker (1985) has shown that there are some apparent violations to the Mirror Principle and that there are more operations involved in the determination of the final linear order of morphemes. Firstly, the left adjunction requirement of head movement has been relaxed, as right adjunction has been shown to be possible (Harley 2010 among others). Therefore, different heads can have a specification for right vs. left adjunction. We could imagine, for example, that there is a language in which head movement of the noun to the Number head is specified for right adjunction, rather than left adjunction which is the case in English. In that language, the predicted order of the noun and plural morpheme would then be &quot;s-cat&quot;. Notice, however, that right vs. left adjunction determines whether an affix will be realized as a prefix or a suffix: its closeness to the root will still reflect hierarchical order. Let&#x27;s look at a hypothetical example to make this clear. Assuming that Tense is merged higher than Aspect, there are four possible orders for the tense and aspect morphemes with respect to the verb stem, once we allow for variation between left and right adjunction in head movement.

# Verb – Aspect – Tense
# Tense – Verb – Aspect 
# Aspect-Verb-Tense
# Tense-Aspect-Verb

Crucially, though, the following two orders are predicted to be impossible.

# Aspect-Tense- Verb 
# Verb – Tense – Aspect

These orders are the orders in which the tense morpheme is closer to the root than the aspect morpheme. Since Aspect is merged before Tense and morpheme order still reflects hierarchical order, such a configuration is predicted to be impossible.

Finally, certain post-syntactic operations can affect morpheme order. The best studied one is Morphological Merger or Merger Under Adjacency. This operation merges two adjacent terminal nodes into one morphological word. In other words, it allows for two heads which are adjacent to merge into one word without syntactic head movement – the operation is post-syntactic. This operation is doing the work of, say, affix lowering of the past tense morpheme in English in early generative syntax. For the operation to apply, what is crucial is that the morphemes to be merged are linearly adjacent.

===Allomorphy===

A core idea in deriving allomorphy in Distributed Morphology is underspecification. Verbal agreement in the present tense in English takes the form /-s/ in the 3rd person singular (‘ex. John eats bologna’), and /Ø/ in all other cases (‘I eat bologna;’ ‘They eat bologna’). The phonological exponents of the feature bundle terminal nodes in the syntactic tree are listed in the Exponent List. We can capture the fact that /-s/ has a much smaller distribution than /Ø/ using the following entries in the Exponent List:

#[3sg, present] ↔ /-s/
#[present] ↔ /Ø/

/-s/ will be inserted whenever its full featural specification is met. In all other cases in the present tense however, such as [2sg, present] or [1sg, present], /Ø/ will be inserted. This is a use of underspecification, the idea that there is a ‘default’ morpheme that is inserted in the general case, and more specific morphemes that are inserted in more specific cases, when their featural specifications are met. In the above example, /Ø/ is underspecified in the sense that it is not specified for person. Underspecification relies on the ‘Maximal Subset Condition.’ 

The Maximal Subset Condition states firstly that, for a given exponent E to be inserted into some feature bundle T, the featural specification on E must be a subset of the features on T. In this way, /-s/ is not a possible exponent for a feature bundle [2sg, present]. However, /Ø/ is a possible exponent for the feature bundle [3sg, present]. To ensure that /-s/ is chosen over /Ø/ for the bundle [3sg, present], the Maximal Subset Condition states secondly that, between two exponents E and F which both contain a subset of the features in a feature bundle T, the exponent that contains the maximal subset of the features in T will be selected.

Featural specification derives allomorphy in featural paradigms. Allomorphy in which different phonological exponents of the same feature bundle are idiosyncratically realized depending on the morphological or phonological environment is captured through contextual specification. An example of such allomorphy is the English plural marker. The typical English plural marker is /-z/, as in bulls. However, the plural of child is children, and the plural of cactus is cacti. Since the choice of the plural morpheme exponent is not related to features, but rather simply to the root it attaches to, the roots must be listed in the contextual specification:
#[-sg] ↔ /-z/
#[-sg] ↔ /-ren/ / _ {child}
#[-sg] ↔ /-i/ / _ {cact}

If the contextual specification of some item is met, it is inserted. Otherwise, insert the item that has no contextual specification. This is an example of the ‘elsewhere condition’. Note that the Maximal Subset Condition stated above is a formal instantiation of the elsewhere condition.

Contextual specification is also used to account for phonologically conditioned suppletive allomorphy, using phonological contexts. Thus, the singular indefinite marker in English can be stated as follows (we could also underspecify one of the allomorphs to express a default morpheme):

#[-def, +sg] ↔ an / _V
#[-def, +sg] ↔ a / _C

A prediction about suppletive allomorphy in Distributed Allomorphy is that, assuming exponents are inserted in a bottom-up fashion of the syntactic tree, it should always be ‘inward-looking.’ This means that contextual allomorphy can only involve the selection of an allomorph based on something lower in the tree. That is, the contextual environments must always involve items lower in the tree.

Morphologically conditioned allomorphy may involve suppletion (as in &quot;go-Ø/wen-t&quot;) or readjustment rules that apply in the context of certain Vocabulary items (as in &quot;buy-Ø/bough-t&quot;). Suppletion and readjustment rules apply to a terminal node and its associated Vocabulary item – unlike affixation, which combines this terminal node with a separate terminal node that has its own distinct (though potentially null) Vocabulary item. Suppletion arises from the competition of Vocabulary items for insertion into a terminal node. Competition involving root Vocabulary items is a topic of ongoing research, however. Early work in Distributed Morphology suggests that a single, abstract lexical root appears in the syntax; in this view, roots do not compete for insertion into root nodes, but exist in free variation, constrained only by semantic and pragmatic well-formedness. Subsequent research has suggested that the distribution of root Vocabulary items can be grammatically restricted (Embick 2000, Pfau 2000, Marantz 2013); this means that roots may be featurally restricted and thus subject to competition. The issue of whether root alternations such as &quot;buy-Ø/bough-t&quot; are better handled by suppletion or readjustment rules remains a topic of debate (Embick &amp; Marantz 2008, Siddiqi 2009, Bonet &amp; Harbour 2012).

The term &quot;suppletion&quot; refers to allomorphy of an open-class lexical item. For a large-scale study of suppletion in the context of comparative and superlative adjectival morphology within the general framework of Distributed Morphology, see Bobaljik (2012).

=== Containment hypothesis ===
The containment hypothesis is a theory under the framework of Distributed Morphology advanced by Bobaljik (2012) to account for the restrictions on the patterns of suppletion seen in language. It states:&quot;The representation of the superlative properly contains that of the comparative (in all languages that have a morphological superlative).&quot;Bobaljik argues that if a language has a superlative form, it must build off the comparative form. In other words, the superlative form and the bare adjective cannot be built off the same root to the exclusion of the comparative (a so-called *ABA pattern), because the comparative is necessarily &quot;contained&quot; within the superlative form. Thus, languages allow:
# AAA: All three forms to be built off the same adjectival root
# ABB: The comparative and superlative are suppletive and thus built off a different root from that of the bare adjective
# ABC: The bare adjective, comparative, and superlative are all built off different roots

The exclusion of the *ABA pattern means that there should theoretically exist no language with a pattern analogous to *&quot;good – better – goodest&quot;. AAB patterns (in which the superlative is suppletive but the comparative builds off the bare adjective) are theoretically possible as well but happen to be rare in the world&#x27;s languages. Under the model of Distributed Morphology, the structure of a superlative would be [SPRL [CMPR [ADJ Adjective ] Comparative ] Superlative ]. Thus, the exponent of the comparative morpheme attaches to the bare adjective and the exponent of the superlative morpheme attaches to the comparative form (or replaces it in the suppletive cases). The following rules may be posited for Czech as an example:
# √BAD → špatn-
# √BAD → hor- / ___ CMPR
# CMPR → -ší
# SPRL → nej-
Rule 2 above states that the root BAD is suppleted in the environment of a comparative. By extension, the superlative form attaches the prefix &quot;nej-&quot; to &quot;horši&quot; and not to &quot;špatn-&quot; as the comparative is the only structure it can see. For Latin, in which both the comparative &quot;and&quot; the superlative are suppleted, the following rules may be posited:
# √GOOD → bon-
# √GOOD → mel- / ___ CMPR
# √GOOD → opt- / ___ SPRL
# CMPR → -ior
# SPRL → -imus
As an *ABA pattern would require the adjective to directly combine with the superlative node, it is theoretically impossible because of the intervening comparative node and is also unattested in the world&#x27;s languages. Nevins (2015) supports the structure by arguing that the semantics of the superlative is dependent on that of the comparative.
# Comparative: Y is more ADJ than X
# Superlative: For all X, Y is more ADJ than X
The comparative definition is contained within the superlative one and thus, the superlative must obligatorily subsume it in its structure.

===Morphological paradigms===

In Distributed Morphology morphological paradigms are seen as epiphenomena. Irregular forms or gaps associated with paradigms are explained via competition for vocabulary insertion.

===Meaning in Distributed Morphology===

In Distributed Morphology there are two different types of meaning: the meaning associated with the bundles of features of the Lexicon and the idiosyncratic meaning listed in the Encyclopedia. It is believed that encyclopedic meaning is associated with lexical roots, rather than with complete phrases.

===Allosemy===

Allosemy – the phenomenon in which a single morpheme can have multiple semantic realizations – is handled the same way allomorphy is handled in DM: through contextual specification and the Elsewhere Condition. The Encyclopedic List contains the semantic meaning and context for each entry in the list. When a single morpheme is realized with multiple possible meanings, it has multiple entries in the Encyclopedic List. Thus, we can derive multiple possible meanings of ‘look’ with the following entries: (note: √ indicates square root, CAPS LOCK indicates semantic concept)

#√ look ←→ PHYSICAL APPEARANCE / [__]V Adj
#√ look ←→ NOTABLE GLANCE / [__]N 
#√ look ←→ CONSULT A SOURCE / [ __ up]V 
#√ look ←→ λ x, λ y, y looks at x / elsewhere

 The contextual specifications for √ look will ensure that it has the appropriate interpretation given the context. The contextual specifications can only include various pieces of information, such as the word class of the item, the word class of a sister node, or even the specific morpheme of the sister node. However, it cannot contain any information about a non-sister node (although there will be some complications when a word intervenes between a word and the relevant sister node ex. “look the book up.”). And, just as in the Exponent List, an item in the Encyclopedic List can be specified as being inserted ‘elsewhere:’ in all contexts where the contextual specification of all other entries for that morpheme are not met. Besides expressing the notion of a ‘default’ semantic meaning of a given morpheme, having the elsewhere condition as an explicit contextual specification also allows for the expression of morphemes that do not have a default semantic meaning.
 For many English speakers, ‘cahoot’ only has an interpretation when preceded by ‘in’ (ex. John was in cahoots with the Russians.) The entry for ‘cahoot’ might have the following entry for such a context:

#√ cahoot ←→ CONSPIRACY / [ in [ ___ -sg ] ]
 To express the fact that this is the only context where cahoot has a meaning, we simply posit that there is no entry for cahoot with the elsewhere condition for its contextual specification. Thus, by allowing for the omission of the elsewhere specification, we can express the fact that certain morphemes require a specific context for interpretation.
 We can use contextual specification to model other aspects of idiomatic meaning, namely, the fact that idiomatic meaning often does not hold across different syntactic configurations. The expression the shit hit the fan loses its idiomatic meaning if passivized: #the fan was hit by the shit. We can express this fact by specifying voice on the contextual specification for the verb:

#√ hit ←→BECOME AN EXTREME SITUATION / [voiceactive [ ____ fan]]

 Finally, just as in allomorphy, the Maximal Subset Principle will play a part if the contextual specification for one alloseme is a subset of another alloseme. While the following entries for eat, meant to express two possible meanings for the phrase eat up (ex. John ate up the story vs. John ate up all his food), are not necessarily the exact specifications, they illustrate a hypothetical use of the Maximal Subset Condition:

#√ eat ←→ ENJOY / [ ____ up] [non-food object]
#√ eat ←→ FINISH THE FOOD / [ ____ up]
 The FINISH THE FOOD entry for √ eat will be inserted whenever eat up is followed by any food object. However, when eat up is followed by a non-food object, both entries’ contextual specifications will be met. However, the ENJOY entry is inserted, because more conditions in its contextual specification are met. Thus, the Maximal Subset Condition will choose the alloseme whose contextual specification is most completely satisfied, when there is competition among Encyclopedic List entries.

=== Crosslinguistic variation ===

Since the model of Distributed Morphology consists of three lists (Formative List, Exponent List, Encyclopedia), we expect crosslinguistic variation to be located in all three of them. The feature bundles and their structure might be different from language to language (Formative List), which could affect both syntactic and post-syntactic operations. Vocabulary Items (Exponent List) can also be different crosslinguistically. Finally, the interpretation of roots (Encyclopedia) is also expected to show variation.

<text>Leonardo Jesús Hernández (born November 6, 1959), commonly known as Leo Hernandez (er-NAN-dez), is a Venezuelan former Major League Baseball third baseman and right-handed batter who played for the Baltimore Orioles (1982–83, 1985) and New York Yankees (1986). He is currently the hitting coach for DSL Mets1.

A native of Santa Lucía, Miranda State, Venezuela, Hernández was signed as an amateur free agent by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1978. He hit .298 with 25 home runs and 91 runs batted in (RBI) with the San Antonio Missions in 1981. After batting .313 in 18 games with the Albuquerque Dukes to begin the 1982 season, he was traded from the Dodgers to the Orioles for José Morales on April 28, 1982. He made his debut with Baltimore on September 19, 1982. He was sent from the Orioles to the Yankees on December 16, 1985 to complete a transaction from five days prior on December 11 when Gary Roenicke was traded to New York for Rex Hudler and Rich Bordi.

In four-season career, Hernández hit .226 with seven home runs and 30 RBI in 85 games.

Hernandez was named as the hitting coach for the DSL Mets 1 of the New York Mets organization for the 2018 season.

<doc id="646191" wikidata="Q940780" url="?curid=646191" title="Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)">
<text>Sunflower is the 16th studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on August 31, 1970 by Reprise Records, their first for the label. It received favorable reviews, but sold poorly, reaching number 151 on the US record charts during a four-week stay and becoming the lowest-charting Beach Boys album to that point. &quot;Add Some Music to Your Day&quot; was the only single that charted in the US, peaking at number 64. In the UK, the album peaked at number 29.

Working titles for the album included &quot;Reverberation&quot;, &quot;Add Some Music&quot;, and &quot;The Fading Rock Group Revival&quot;. The recording sessions began in January 1969, and, after a year-long search for a new record contract, completed in July 1970. In contrast to &quot;20/20&quot;, the record featured a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. About four dozen songs were written for the album, and the label rejected numerous revisions of its track listing before the band presented enough formidable material deemed satisfactory for release. It includes &quot;This Whole World&quot;, one of Brian Wilson&#x27;s most complex songs, &quot;Forever&quot;, regarded as among Dennis Wilson&#x27;s finest, and &quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot;, a song that originated from the band&#x27;s &quot;Smile&quot; sessions.

Fans generally consider &quot;Sunflower&quot; to be among the Beach Boys&#x27; finest post-&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; albums. It has appeared in several critics&#x27; and listeners&#x27; polls for the best albums of all time, including &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 2003 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. The track &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; was later cited as one of the earliest examples of dream pop. Many &quot;Sunflower&quot; outtakes and leftover songs later appeared on subsequent Beach Boys releases, including the follow-up &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (1971) and the compilation &quot;Feel Flows&quot; (2021). 

==Background and recording==
===January – May 1969 ===
The Beach Boys were at their lowest popularity in the late 1960s, and their cultural standing was especially worsened by their public image, which remained incongruous with the &quot;heavier&quot; music of their peers. Released by Capitol Records in February 1969, the band&#x27;s newest album &quot;20/20&quot; sold better than their previous, &quot;Friends&quot; (1968). However, they remained encumbered by an enormous debt that had been partly the result of two disastrous tours in 1968. Recording sessions for their next album began in January 1969 and were produced by the Beach Boys collectively and by Brian Wilson and Carl Wilson, Bruce Johnston, Al Jardine, and Dennis Wilson individually. Throughout the year, they recorded about four dozen studio tracks, with working titles for the new album including &quot;Reverberation&quot;, &quot;Sun Flower&quot;, and &quot;Add Some Music&quot;.

On April 12, the Beach Boys filed suit against Capitol for unpaid royalties and production duties in the amount of $2 million (equivalent to $ in ). In a press statement for this news, they also announced that they would be reviving their Brother Records imprint. On April 16, Capitol A&amp;R director Karl Engemaan drafted a letter to band manager Nick Grillo indicating that the group and label were still interested in renewing their contract. Engemaan asked the group to be ready to deliver the new album (then known under the working titles &quot;The Fading Rock Group Revival&quot; or &quot;Reverberation&quot;) by May 1. Only seven of the ten tracks were completed by the deadline, and so the album was not delivered.

In 1969, Brian was increasingly known for his reclusiveness and eccentric behavior, which affected his reputation within the music industry. Grillo struggled to find another major label interested in signing the group, as he remembered, &quot;Brian was notorious at that point&quot; and label executives found the band too risky to sign. Since the Beach Boys&#x27; remained highly popular in the UK, Grillo attempted to secure a foreign, worldwide contract with a European company. During the first half of 1969, the Beach Boys continued to tour and increasingly engaged in benefit concerts held at hospitals and penitentiaries.

===May – October 1969===
On May 27, three days before the group embarked on a four-week tour of the UK and Europe, Brian told the music press that the group&#x27;s funds were depleted to the point that they were considering filing for bankruptcy at the end of the year, which &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; called &quot;stunning news&quot; and a &quot;tremendous shock on the American pop scene&quot;. In response, Grillo told reporters that Brian&#x27;s comments were untrue and that he was &quot;just putting you on&quot;. Brian said he hoped that the success of a forthcoming single, &quot;Break Away&quot;, would mend the band&#x27;s financial issues. He wrote the song with his father and ex-band manager Murry Wilson. It was released on June 16 with the B-side &quot;Celebrate the News&quot;, a Dennis song, and peaked at number 63 in the US and number 6 in the UK. During that summer, Brian focused his attention on launching the Radiant Radish, a health food store in West Hollywood.

From May 30 to June 30, the Beach Boys toured with Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders and Joe Hicks. Their Capitol contract expired on June 30 with one more album still due, after which the label deleted the Beach Boys&#x27; catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow. Studio recording resumed sporadically from July to October amid numerous promotional appearances.

The Beach Boys expected that, since they were considered a &quot;legendary band&quot; by this point, many other labels would approach them with contractual offers, but few did. Throughout June, the group met with the Berlin-based company Deutsche Grammophon, who were keen to sign the band, but Brian&#x27;s remarks in the press ultimately thwarted the contract negotiations. Polydor, Deutsche&#x27;s American affiliate, also refused to sign the group because the company did not like the band&#x27;s music or the members personally. CBS and MGM also rejected the band.

In August, the Manson Family committed the Tate–LaBianca murders. According to Jon Parks, the band&#x27;s tour manager, it was widely suspected in the Hollywood community that Charles Manson was responsible for the murders, and it had been known that Manson had been involved with the Beach Boys, causing the band to be viewed as pariahs for a time. That same month, Carl, Dennis, Mike Love, and Jardine sought a permanent replacement for Johnston. They approached Carl&#x27;s brother-in-law Billy Hinsche, who declined the offer to focus on his college studies. In late 1969 (either reported as occurring in August or November), Murry Wilson sold the Sea of Tunes publishing company (including the rights to the majority of Brian&#x27;s songs) to A&amp;M Records&#x27; publishing division for $700,000 ($ in ).

===November 1969 – July 1970===

According to music historian Keith Badman, a breakthrough with Warner Bros. Records inspired &quot;an immense sense of optimism&quot; and a &quot;remarkable amount of new material&quot; recorded in November 1969. He stated that the group, &quot;including a temporarily rejuvenated Brian&quot;, prepared material with &quot;as many songwriting collaborators as possible&quot; as they regarded &quot;the forthcoming album as a make-or-break disc.&quot; On November 18, Warner executive Mo Ostin agreed to sign the band to their subsidiary Reprise Records. This deal was brokered by Van Dyke Parks, a former collaborator of Brian&#x27;s who was then employed as a multimedia executive at Warner Music Group. The contract dealt by Reprise stipulated Brian&#x27;s proactive involvement with the band in all albums. Another part of the deal was to revive Brother Records.

Shortly before signing with Reprise, the group accumulated enough material for a new album, now titled &quot;Sun Flower&quot;, and assembled a provisional 14-song acetate for the label. This collection was rejected. Warner Bros. executive Dave Berson remembered: &quot;It seemed like an amazing thing to do, to say to the Beach Boys, &#x27;This is not the kind of an album we want to pay for.&#x27; Contractually, we didn&#x27;t have any right to reject albums.&quot; The project was then renamed &quot;Add Some Music&quot; with the subheading &quot;An Album Offering from the Beach Boys&quot;.

From November 25 to December 7, the band embarked on their seventh and final annual Thanksgiving tour of the US. Badman called it &quot;a dismal farewell&quot; to the decade, &quot;with audience members struggling to reach even a couple of hundred at some shows&quot;, forcing most of the dates to be cancelled. In November, the Manson family were apprehended by police for the Tate–LaBianca murders, and the family&#x27;s former connections with Dennis and the Beach Boys became the subject of media attention.

In February 1970, the band submitted a version of &quot;Add Some Music&quot;, but were once again rejected. The company felt that the proposed LP was not strong enough, although they decided to issue two of its tracks as a single, and asked the band to write and record a new batch of songs. From February to June, the group worked on overdubbing and rerecording some of their new material. Another revision was rejected in late May. The album&#x27;s last two songs were finished in July: &quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;. After a July 21 overdubbing session for &quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot; with synthesizer player Bernie Krause, the third and final master of &quot;Sunflower&quot; was delivered to Warner.

==Songs==
===Side one===
====&quot;Slip On Through&quot;====

&quot;Slip On Through&quot; was written and sung by Dennis. Brian recalled, &quot;It was a really dynamic song. Dennis, I was very proud of, because he really rocked and rolled on that one. Dennis did really interesting energetic things on that.&quot;

====&quot;This Whole World&quot;====
&quot;This Whole World&quot; was written by Brian, who said it was &quot;inspired by my love of the world, how I love people, and how people should be free.&quot; Carl sings lead vocals while Brian sings in the background; their voices were double-tracked, as was common practice for many of their recordings. Brian&#x27;s wife Marilyn and her sister Diane Rovell also contributed backing vocals. Brian later produced a version of the song for their group American Spring on the 1972 album &quot;Spring&quot;. As a solo artist, he returned to the song again for the album &quot;I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made for These Times&quot; (1995).

====&quot;Add Some Music to Your Day&quot;====
&quot;Add Some Music to Your Day&quot; is a song with lyrics that are a celebration of music and its ubiquitous presence in daily life. It was written by Brian, Mike Love, and their friend Joe Knott, who was not a professional songwriter. Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that the song was a &quot;pop-folk tune&quot; that &quot;seemed like a perfect statement of purpose to lead off the band&#x27;s second decade, given the tune&#x27;s shared, round-robin style lead vocal, full background harmonies, and a plainspoken lyric&quot;.

====&quot;Got to Know the Woman&quot;====
&quot;Got to Know the Woman&quot; is an R&amp;B song by Dennis that featured backing vocals from female session singers. White noted it was &quot;one of the few Beach Boys songs that could honestly be called funky, its tinkly Dixieland piano a perfect foil for the coarse frivolity of the verses, which contain a boorish come-on to the object of one&#x27;s lowest bump-and-grind fantasies.

====&quot;Deirdre&quot;====
&quot;Deirdre&quot; was credited to Bruce Johnston and Brian. Although Johnston has said that Brian only offered minor lyrical contributions and that he gave him a 50% share in the song as a favor, music historians Andrew G. Doe and John Tobler wrote in 2004 that the song had been &quot;developed from a musical theme first used in &#x27;We&#x27;re Together Again,&#x27;&quot; a 1968 composition credited to Brian Wilson and singer Ron Wilson (no relation). The song was named after the sister of one of Johnston&#x27;s ex-girlfriends and was described by White as &quot;a stroll-tempo devotional to an idealized, red-haired goddess; its stippled use of flutes plus the spacey filtering and compression techniques in the vocal mixes giving the track a celestial grandeur.&quot; In 1994, the song was sampled in the video game &quot;EarthBound&quot;.

====&quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;====
&quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; is an autobiographical rock song about the pitfalls of stardom and fame. It was primarily written by Dennis and outside writer Bob Burchman (a close friend of Dennis&#x27;s second wife, Barbara), with co-writers Carl and Jardine adding various refinements during the recording process. Jardine said: &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s About Time&#x27;&quot; was Carl, Dennis and I [&quot;sic&quot;]. That&#x27;s a good one. I like that production. That was mostly Dennis, and I just helped with the lyrics. Dennis and Carl did the track.&quot; White describes the song as a &quot;commentary on rock indulgence and self-redemption, it was also a wishful scenario regarding both Brian and Dennis Wilson&#x27;s sporadic personal troubles.&quot;

===Side two===
====&quot;Tears in the Morning&quot;====
&quot;Tears in the Morning&quot;, written by Johnston, is a melodramatic song with strings, horns, and accordions. He performed the song during the group&#x27;s live performances without accompaniment from his bandmates. A &quot;Disc &amp; Echo&quot; writer reviewed of a concert in December 1970, &quot;I must admit, it went down a storm, as the song benefited from the simple piano-voice presentation. But if you&#x27;d seen the expressions and heard the mutterings of the others in the group as they were ordered off-stage, it looked decidedly as though Bruce could find himself in the doghouse!&quot;

====&quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;====
&quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; is a reverb-heavy B. Wilson–Love song that was originally attempted during the sessions for &quot;Friends&quot;. Retrospective commentators note the song as one of the earliest examples of chillwave, a microgenre that emerged in the 2000s. Discussing the song in 1995, Brian expressed: &quot;That was one of those songs that had a nice chord pattern, but I think it was a boring song, and I thought it wasn&#x27;t done right. I thought it should have been softer, with boxed guitars.&quot;

====&quot;Forever&quot;====
&quot;Forever&quot; was written by Dennis and his friend Gregg Jakobson. Brian praised the song as &quot;the most harmonically beautiful thing I&#x27;ve ever heard. It&#x27;s a rock and roll prayer.&quot; Love wrote that it &quot;was Dennis&#x27;s most acclaimed ballad, as it captured the raw emotion and bluesy sensibility that he brought to his vocals.&quot;

====&quot;Our Sweet Love&quot;====
&quot;Our Sweet Love&quot; is a reworking of a &quot;Friends&quot; outtake, &quot;Our New Home&quot;. Brian commented: &quot;I wrote that for Carl. After I wrote it I said, &#x27;Hey, he could sing this good&#x27; so I gave it to Carl.&quot; According to Jardine, Brian refused to complete the song: &quot;&#x27;Our Sweet Love&#x27; was one we finished with Brian. He just didn&#x27;t want to finish it. So we kind of helped. We became completers of ideas.&quot;

====&quot;At My Window&quot;====
&quot;At My Window&quot; is a song by Brian and Jardine about the birds in Brian&#x27;s backyard. It evolved from a rendition of &quot;Raspberry, Strawberries&quot;, a Wilt Holt composition that was recorded by the Kingston Trio. The lyrics were written by Jardine. He commented: &quot;That was probably one of my first efforts at involving the other guys. ... I have this dim recollection of writing it and Bruce singing it and Brian trying to speak French in it. It had a nice tone to it. We had an accordion player come in and play some beautiful things on it.&quot;

====&quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot;====

&quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot; evolved from the &quot;Smile&quot; track &quot;Love to Say Dada&quot; and was initially attempted during the 1967 sessions for &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot;. Lenny Waronker, then an A&amp;R executive at Warner Music Group, heard the unfinished tape, and convinced Wilson to finish the track for &quot;Sunflower&quot;. Waronker was so impressed with the song&#x27;s inspired simplicity, that he noted, &quot;If I ever get the opportunity to produce Brian, I&#x27;d encourage him to do something that combined the vividness of &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; with the non-commercial gentleness of &#x27;Cool, Cool Water.&#x27;&quot; Wilson later said: &quot;In &#x27;Cool, Cool Water&#x27; there&#x27;s a chant I wish we hadn&#x27;t used. It fits all right, but there&#x27;s just something I don&#x27;t think is quite right with it.&quot;

===Leftover===
Around three dozen songs were left off &quot;Sunflower&quot;. Each member of the band, including Brian, wrote numerous songs for the album. Brian alone had about a full-length album&#x27;s worth of material that he had written by himself or with collaborators. Among these, &quot;Where Is She?&quot; is a Brian song that, according to band archivist Alan Boyd, resembles the Beatles&#x27; &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot;. He said: &quot;It&#x27;s one of those times that the band&#x27;s engineer Steve Desper recalls Brian simply getting an idea and he built this song from the ground up.&quot;In 2013, &quot;Where Is She&quot; was released on the box set Made In California. &quot;Take a Load Off Your Feet (Pete)&quot;, written by Brian and Jardine with schoolfriend Gary Winfrey, was included on the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (1971). &quot;Loop de Loop&quot;, written by Brian, Carl, and Jardine, was the latter&#x27;s rearrangement of &quot;Sail Plane Song&quot;, a &quot;20/20&quot; Brian/Carl outtake. In 1998, Jardine completed the song for the &quot;Endless Harmony Soundtrack&quot; with the original 1969 mix seeing release on the 2021 box set &quot;Feel Flows&quot;. The former compilation also included &quot;Soulful Old Man Sunshine&quot;, a collaboration between Brian, Rick Henn (former leader of the Sunrays) and veteran arranger/producer Don Ralke.

&quot;Lady&quot; was written by Dennis and featured a string arrangement by keyboardist Daryl Dragon. The song was later considered for &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; but passed for inclusion. Instead, in December 1970, Wilson released it as the B-side of the &quot;Sound of Free&quot; single, credited to &quot;Dennis Wilson &amp; Rumbo&quot;. &quot;Good Time&quot; was a collaboration between Brian and Jardine. In 1972, American Spring recorded versions of &quot;Lady&quot; (with the new title &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot;) and &quot;Good Time&quot;, the latter with new vocals overdubbed onto the Beach Boys&#x27; original backing track, for their album &quot;Spring&quot;. In 1977, the original &quot;Sunflower&quot; version of &quot;Good Time&quot; was placed on &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot;. In 1981, &quot;San Miguel&quot;, a collaboration between Dennis and Gregg Jakobson, was released for the compilation &quot;Ten Years of Harmony&quot;. Jardine&#x27;s &quot;Susie Cincinnati&quot; was released as the B-side of the &quot;Add Some Music to Your Day&quot; single and as a track on the 1976 album &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;.

&quot;I Just Got My Pay&quot; is a song that contains a reworked melody from the 1964 outtake &quot;All Dressed Up for School&quot;, with both songs being released on the 1993 box set &quot;Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of the Beach Boys.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Going Your Way&quot; is a Dennis song about picking up hitchhikers and the sexual intercourse that might follow while &quot;Carnival&quot; (aka &quot;Over the Waves&quot;) is a wordless vocal rendition of the standard &quot;When You Are in Love (It&#x27;s the Loveliest Night of the Year)&quot;. Both songs were released on the 2021 box set Feel Flows. Also recorded was &quot;When Girls Get Together&quot; (released on the 1980 album &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot;), &quot;Games Two Can Play&quot; (released on the 1993 box set &quot;Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of the Beach Boys&quot;), &quot;Back Home&quot; (a version different from the one released on &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;), a rehearsal of the &quot;Wild Honey&quot; song &quot;Let the Wind Blow&quot; (a song that was added to the band&#x27;s setlists in this era), a solo piano demo of &quot;Til I Die&quot; with no vocals (later completed for &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;), and a keyboard-only version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;. The latter two recordings were released on the 2021 box set &quot;Feel Flows&quot;. 

==Packaging==
The picture of the band on the front sleeve, featuring all six group members, was taken on the golf course at Dean Martin&#x27;s Hidden Valley Ranch near Thousand Oaks in Ventura County, California. His son Ricci Martin, a friend of the band, took the photograph, also featuring Brian&#x27;s daughter Wendy, Al&#x27;s first son Matthew, Mike&#x27;s children Hayleigh and Christian, and Carl&#x27;s son Jonah. The inner gatefold spread on the original vinyl LP featured a series of photographs taken by designer/photographer Ed Thrasher at the Warner Bros. studio backlot.

==Release==

On February 23, 1970, &quot;Add Some Music to Your Day&quot; (B-side &quot;Susie Cincinnati&quot;) was issued as lead single. Reprise was so excited about the record that they convinced retailers to carry more copies of it than that of any other artist on their roster ever. This made it the fastest-selling 45rpm record in the label&#x27;s history. In March, Love was hospitalized after a three-week fast in which he ate only water, fruit juice, and yogurt – per the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Brian replaced Love on the road during this period. He remembered: &quot;When Mike Love was sick, I went with the group up to Seattle and Vancouver and the Northwest for some appearances. I was scared for a few minutes in the first show—it had been a while since I was in front of so many people. But after it started to cook I really got with it. It was the best three days of my life, I guess.&quot;

In April, &quot;Add Some Music to Your Day&quot; peaked at number 64 in the US during a five-week stay. DJs generally refused to play the song on the radio. According to band promoter Fred Vail, WFIL program director Jay Cook refused to play the song even after &quot;telling me how great the Beach Boys are and how great Brian is.&quot; On April 17, the regular touring band, with Love, embarked on their first major tour of the year: a four-week trek of New Zealand and Australia. Supporting musicians for this tour included bassist Ed Carter and keyboardist Daryl Dragon. Murry Wilson also accompanied the group for this tour. Australian magazine &quot;Go Set&quot; reported that the band&#x27;s next album was titled &quot;Cool Water&quot; and that Emerald Films would be creating a color film documentary of the tour, produced by the BBC&#x27;s Steve Turner.

None of the album&#x27;s other singles charted in the US or UK. Due to the poor response to the lead single, Warner suggested that the band refrain from calling the new album &quot;Add Some Music&quot;. In late June, Brian told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that he was thinking about composing the soundtrack to an Andy Warhol film about a &quot;gay surfer&quot;. On June 29, the second single &quot;Slip On Through&quot; (B-side &quot;This Whole World&quot;) was issued in the US. Love wrote in his 2016 memoir that &quot;Warner/Reprise was adrift on how to position &quot;Sunflower&quot;&quot; and that the band had &quot;thought about shortening [our] name to &#x27;Beach&#x27; but concluded that was even worse.&quot;

On August 31, 1970, &quot;Sunflower&quot; was released in the US by Brother/Reprise. At the time, Brian told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;I think we threw away at least one good song on [&quot;Sunflower&quot;]. Overall the record is good but it doesn&#x27;t please me as much as I wish. ... But all in all, with some good airplay, the record should do very well.&quot; The album became the Beach Boys&#x27; worst-selling to date, reaching number 151 on US record charts during a four-week stay. Its failure was attributed partly to the fact that FM rock radio DJs considered the songs too conventional for their playlists. Biographer David Leaf wrote that the sales numbers were greatly disappointing for the Beach Boys, and that Brian was especially affected: &quot;That, on top of the old, unhealed scars, was a hurt he didn&#x27;t really begin to get over until 1976.&quot;

In the UK, &quot;Sunflower&quot; was released in November 1970, on Stateside Records, and peaked at number 29. A British trade magazine reported: &quot;The album has been out less than one week, and it already is indicated to be their most popular recording in history, according to EMI Records.&quot; However, the album continued to sell poorly. Two more US singles, &quot;Tears in the Morning&quot; (B-side &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;) and &quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot; (B-side &quot;Forever&quot;), followed on October 21, 1970, and March 1971, respectively. The former was released in November 1970 as their only UK single.

==Contemporary reviews==
Despite its poor sales, &quot;Sunflower&quot; received considerable critical acclaim in the US and the UK. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jim Miller called it &quot;without doubt the best Beach Boys album in recent memory, a stylistically coherent &quot;tour de force&quot;&quot;, but mused: &quot;It makes one wonder though whether anyone still listens to their music, or could give a shit about it.&quot; Following Miller&#x27;s review, several other American magazines published favorable assessments, but as Badman writes, &quot;The damage done by their non-appearance at [the] Monterey [Pop Festival] in 1967 seem[ed] irreversible among rock&#x27;s opinion-formers.&quot;

&quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau said that as a coming-of-age record from the Beach Boys, &quot;Sunflower&quot; is &quot;far more satisfying, I suspect, than &quot;Smile&quot; ever would have been&quot;. He added that the &quot;same medium-honest sensibility&quot; and Southern California ethos of their 1960s music remains, &quot;only now they sing about broken marriages and the pleasure of life. Still a lot of fun too.&quot; In the English music press, the album was favorably compared by many critics to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

==Retrospective assessments and legacy==

Fans generally regard &quot;Sunflower&quot; as the Beach Boys&#x27; finest post-&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Hefner Macauley deemed &quot;Sunflower&quot; &quot;perhaps the strongest album they released post-&quot;Pet Sounds&quot;&quot;, while Chris Holmes of &quot;Popdose&quot; declared that &quot;it stands as the definitive post-&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; Beach Boys album&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot;″s Brian Chidester wrote that the album &quot;was, in many respects, their &quot;Abbey Road&quot;—a lush production that signaled an end to the 1960s, the decade that gave them creative flight.&quot; Music theorist Daniel Harrison referred to &quot;Sunflower&quot; as the end of an experimental songwriting and production epoch for the group, one that had begun with 1967&#x27;s &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;.

In his 2016 memoir, Love acknowledged that &quot;Sunflower&quot; was &quot;damn good ... I also know that we have fans who cherish that album like none other.&quot; Wilson biographer Christian Matijas-Mecca stated that the album was the band&#x27;s best effort since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and said that it &quot;demonstrated, more than any other Beach Boys album before or since, that the six members could work democratically and deliver songs of real depth.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Beach Boys and the California Myth&quot; (1978), David Leaf summarized the work as &quot;the first album that could come close to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; on a production level, partly the result of studio engineer Steve Desper&#x27;s fine work. The Beach Boys&#x27; harmonies were present in a way they hadn&#x27;t been since &quot;Summer Days...&quot; and it was probably the truest group effort ever in that it was a showcase for all the individuals in the band.&quot; Peter Ames Carlin summarized:

&quot;Sunflower&quot; was voted number 380 in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; (2003), number 66 in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Albums Ever&quot; (1997), and number 449 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In his review of the album&#x27;s 2000 remaster, Keith Phipps from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said that &quot;Sunflower&quot; &quot;features one of The Beach Boys&#x27; most coherent and lovely selections of music&quot;, with the best songs penned by Brian. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Noel Murray wrote that the album could be interpreted as the band&#x27;s response to &quot;the wave of &#x27;sunshine pop&#x27; and &#x27;bubblegum&#x27; acts that had emerged over the previous couple of years, showing that no one could write and record slick, melodic, harmony-drenched songs quite like The Beach Boys.&quot;

Among the band members, Bruce Johnston later named &quot;Sunflower&quot; his favorite Beach Boys album. In the 1970s, he considered it to be the last true Beach Boys album because it was the last to feature Brian&#x27;s input and active involvement. He nonetheless regretted the inclusion of his two songs, saying that &quot;Tears in the Morning&quot; was &quot;too pop&quot; and that &quot;I wish I hadn&#x27;t recorded [&#x27;Deirdre&#x27;] with the group.&quot; Conversely, Brian said that &quot;Deirdre&quot; was &quot;one of my very favorites&quot; and that &quot;Tears in the Morning&quot; was &quot;lovely&quot;. For the album&#x27;s 2000 liner notes, it was written that he &quot;attributes the staying power of &quot;Sunflower&quot; ... to the &#x27;spiritual love&#x27; of the music&quot;.

==Track listing==
===Original release===


Notes
* The international version of the LP had &quot;Cottonfields&quot; as the first track on side one.
* &quot;Slip On Through&quot; and &quot;Got to Know the Woman&quot; were originally credited to Dennis Wilson alone. Following a consultation with Wilson&#x27;s estate and publishing, credits to Gregg Jakobson were officially added in 2021.
* &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; was not originally co-credited to Carl Wilson. His credit was similarly added in 2021.

===&quot;Reverberation&quot;===
Midway through the recording of &quot;Sunflower&quot;, the band assembled an album for Capitol with some tracks that were later placed on &quot;Sunflower&quot;. It had the working title of &quot;Reverberation&quot;. Although a master tape (dated June 19, 1970) of songs was put together, this album was never released. Instead, they fulfilled their contract with the May 1970 album &quot;Live in London&quot;. All of the following tracks have seen an official release in later years.

===&quot;Feel Flows&quot;===

In 2021, expanded editions of &quot;Sunflower&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; were packaged within &quot;Feel Flows&quot;, a box set that includes session highlights, outtakes, and alternate mixes drawn from the two albums.

<doc id="646194" wikidata="Q1172884" url="?curid=646194" title="Treaty of Lambeth">
<text>The Treaty of Lambeth of 1217, also known as the Treaty of Kingston to distinguish it from the Treaty of Lambeth of 1212, was a peace treaty signed by Louis of France in September 1217 ending the campaign known as the First Barons&#x27; War to uphold the claim by Louis to the throne of England. When the campaign had begun, baronial enemies of the unpopular English king John had flocked to the French banner, but after John&#x27;s death in 1216, and his replacement by a regent, William Marshal, on behalf of John&#x27;s young son and successor, Henry III, many had switched sides. Subsequent defeats at Lincoln in May 1217 and at Dover and Sandwich in August 1217 forced Louis to negotiate.

Information on the treaties is based on three early documents but none of these is known to have been based on an original manuscript. It is known that negotiations were spread over several locations, opening on 6 September 1217 at Staines, because the royal court was nearby at Chertsey or possibly on 5 September on an island of the Thames near Kingston. Various dates for treaties are given by the sources including:
* a treaty signed by Louis and Henry&#x27;s regents on 11 September at Lambeth Palace (the archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s London house),
* a Treaty of Kingston on 12 September,
* papal ratification from the papal legate, who was encamped near Kingston on the 13 September and who issued his terms on 22 September at Merton.
* a Treaty of Lambeth signed on 20 September ratifying the Kingston treaty.

Whatever documents were actually signed during September, Louis left England for the last time from Dover on 28 September. The principal provisions of the treaties were an amnesty for English rebels. It was also acknowledged that the French had failed to take possession of the entire Channel Islands and so possession of the individual islands was restored to the king of England. Louis undertook not to attack England again and agreed to renounce his claim to the English throne, in exchange for 10,000 marks. Scottish troops under Alexander II also withdrew.

There is no known surviving copy of the treaties.

<text>In Mexican and other Latin American cultures, it is customary to celebrate a girl&#x27;s 15th birthday. In Spanish, the girl celebrating her 15th birthday is called a ; in English, primarily in the United States, quinceañera is used to refer to the celebrations and honors surrounding the special occasion. The Spanish names for the celebration can be literally translated to English as the &quot;celebration of the 15-year-old&quot; (, ), &quot;15 years&quot; (, ) or just 15 ().

This birthday is celebrated differently from any other as it marks the transition from childhood to young womanhood. Historically, in the years prior to their 15th birthdays, girls learned about cooking, weaving, and childbearing from the elder women in their communities in preparation for their future roles as wives. During the celebration the girl&#x27;s father would present her to potential suitors.

In the past, parallel customs could be found in Southern Europe, mainly Spain and France. Today, the custom remains strongest in Mexico, its likely country of introduction during the viceregal or Mexican imperial periods. However, it is widely celebrated in Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas. The grandest parties are comparable to British and American debutante balls. The celebrations themselves vary significantly in different countries; for example, the festivities in some have taken on more religious overtones than in others. Nowadays, the is also celebrated by many Latino Americans in the United States, each according to their traditions.

In Brazil, a Portuguese-speaking country, a similar celebration is called , , or . In the French Caribbean and French Guiana, it is called .

== Origin ==

Contemporary festivities combine Catholic traditions from old Spain with the traditions of indigenous heritages of pre-Columbian Mexico, along with a few modern twists, and rely heavily on European influence from the period of the Second Mexican Empire. For example: In ancient Mexico, the Aztecs and other indigenous peoples had many different ceremonies to mark the passage through the various stages of life. The marked a young woman&#x27;s transition to adulthood, as she was presented, as a virgin, to the community for probable suitors. Other origin stories attribute quinceañera history to the Duchess of Alba in Spain, who hosted a ball at her palace and invited adolescent girls to attend in formal clothes. This tradition would continue and was reinforced when Empress Carlota of Mexico, granddaughter of the Louis Philippe I of France, threw a similar reception for her court in Mexico City—presenting young women as eligible for marriage. The traditions of the quinceañera wearing elaborate ball gowns, utilizing courtly European social customs, and ballroom dancing coincides with the styles and customs of the period of the Second Mexican Empire, which was an extension of the European royal courts of the time.

In a traditional Mexican , young women and men have roles as formal and , who perform special bends at the celebration, along with the herself. There is also a &quot;man of honor&quot; who accompanies the young woman. Potential suitors present gifts to her family to make up a dowry or bridal wealth. Prior to her being given away, the women of the community participate by instructing the in her duties and responsibilities, urging her to follow the correct path, by remaining true to her people and their traditions throughout her life.

== Changes over the years ==
The meaning behind the has become more refined over time and has been adapted by various Latino cultures in relation to where they are living.

In rural societies, girls were considered ready for marriage once they turned 15. In the 20th century, the received certain privileges associated with womanhood: permission to attend adult parties, pluck her eyebrows and shave her legs, wear makeup, jewelry and high heels. When this tradition originated, the was a small party to celebrate the transition. Friends and family gathered in order to give the girl a chance to mingle with young men. Rich families celebrated with big parties and elaborate dresses. In Latin American countries, wealthy families announced in the newspapers to publicize their extravagant celebrations.

In the 1960s, as more Latinos migrated to the United States, they brought their differing national traditions with them. Once in the United States, formerly poor immigrants with good jobs were able to have big parties such as those back in their home country. Family and friends often help put on the event, for example, by making food. From a simple food and cake celebration, it has developed among wealthier families to become an occasion for a big party. Families may use event planners, and develop a celebration with a theme, to be staged with a special entrance and dances, and captured by professional photoshoots and video. Modern celebrations also incorporate traditions from other cultures. Markets for event planners and -related products have developed.

== In specific countries ==

=== Cuba ===

In Cuba, the party may include a choreographed group dance, in which 14 couples waltz around the , who is accompanied by one of the main dancers, a boy of her choice, or her boyfriend. The choreography often includes four or six dancers or escorts called experts, who are allowed to dance around the . They are usually inexperienced dancers whose function is to highlight the central couple. The male dancers are also allowed to wear tuxedos in different colors.

Fifteenth-birthday celebrations were very popular in Cuba until the late 1970s. This practice partly entered Cuba via Spain, but the greatest influence was the French. The wealthy families who could afford to rent expensive dining rooms in private clubs or hotels of four and five stars held celebrations that were the precursors of , which they called . These celebrations usually took place in the house of the girl or the more spacious house of a relative.

Another tradition, commonly found in Cuba, is to have 14 ladies and 14 escorts (sometimes 7 each) as a court. The escorts hold flowers (usually roses) and the ladies carry candles. As the dances the waltz with her father, she blows out one candle, then picks up one rose. This continues until she has blown out all the candles and picked up all the roses. The 14 candles blown out represent her 14 previous years, and with each she makes a wish. When the time comes to cut the cake, the will blow out her last candle, thus completing her 15 wishes. The flowers are given to her mother.

=== Colombia ===

In Colombia, the starts with the arrival of the teenage girl, accompanied by her father; she is received by her mother and other relatives and friends; father and daughter dance a waltz and other tunes. The birthday girl next dances with her brothers (if any) and their uncles and godparents. Then she performs the and the waltz with all members of the procession (then optional dances to other music, such as merengue or pop).

For this occasion the teenager wears an evening dress in light colors or pastels, is dressed and made up slightly, and usually places a tiara in her hair and jewels on her neck and hands. All the guests dress in formal attire, including the teenager&#x27;s peers.

After the first dance, the teenager and her friends have a dance. Then the festival begins with music from live bands, some famous artists, DJs, food, drink, and at one late point of the night a is carried out, in which the attendants wear masks or funny wigs and make noise with whistles and rattles while fast-tempo music is played. It is optional to make some surprise dance performed by the birthday girl (alone or accompanied), and a dance that will give away her friends, cousins, and others.

The custom&#x27;s social significance is such that even poor families tend to spend lavishly on a daughter&#x27;s . The event can cost as much as a year&#x27;s wages, and many take up debt to be able to pay for it.

=== French Guiana and French Caribbean ===

In French Guiana and the French Caribbean, the celebration is known as . It follows a similar structure.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico, the is adorned with elegant jewelry and makeup. By tradition, this was to be the first time she would wear makeup in public, but in the 21st century, girls start using makeup at an earlier age. The is also expected to wear a formal evening dress, traditionally a long, elegant ball gown chosen by the girl and most often, her mother, according to her favorite color and style.

In the Mexican Catholic tradition, the celebration begins with a thanksgiving Mass. She arrives at church accompanied by her parents, godparents, and court of honor. The court of honor is a group of her chosen peers consisting of paired-off girls and boys, respectively known as (dames) and (chamberlains). Typically, the court consists of pairs ranging from 7 to 15 and . At this religious mass, a Rosary, or sometimes a necklace with a locket or pendant depicting Mexico&#x27;s patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe, is presented to the teenager by her godparents, the necklace or rosary having been previously blessed by the priest. She is also awarded a tiara, which serves as a reminder that to her loved ones, especially her immediate family, the will always be a princess. Some also see it as denoting that she is a &quot;princess&quot; before God and the world. After this, the girl may leave her bouquet of flowers on the altar for the Virgin Mary.

After the thanksgiving mass, guests gather for a celebratory reception where the events to honor the will take place, including giving gifts. This reception may be held at the &#x27;s home, at venues (such as dining halls, banquet halls, or casinos), or in some cases, in more public places, similar to a block party. During the reception, the birthday girl usually dances a traditional waltz with her father to a song chosen by both that speaks about the occasion and their relationship. Then her father passes her to the , her chosen escort, and afterward they continue the dance with the rest of her court of honor. Often this section of the celebration is previously practiced and/or choreographed, often weeks in advance, sometimes even with months of anticipation.

The basic reception has six major parts with dances taking place while a traditional Mexican meal is served:
# The formal entry () – A grand entrance made by the once most guests have been seated.
# The formal toast ()– An optional but usually featured part of the reception, generally initiated by the parents or godparents of the birthday girl.
# The first dance – Usually a waltz where the girl dances, starting with her father.
# The family dance – Usually a waltz involving just the immediate relatives, the , godparents, and the closest friends of the girl.
# The preferred song () – Any modern song particularly enjoyed by the is played and danced.
# The general dance – Also usually a traditional waltz.
Traditionally, Mexican girls could not dance in public until they turned 15, except at school dances or at family events. So the waltz with her is choreographed and elaborate to celebrate what was meant to be the &#x27;s first public dance.

Some families may choose to add a ceremonial components to the celebration, depending on local customs. Among them are the ceremony of the Change of Shoes, in which a family member presents the with her first pair of high heel shoes; the Crowning ceremony, in which a close relative places a crown on her head; and (literally &quot;ceremony of the last doll&quot;), during which her father presents her with a doll usually wearing a dress similar to the . The ceremony of the last doll is based on a Maya tradition; it is related to the birthday girl&#x27;s later giving up of the doll as she grows into womanhood.

Once all symbolic gestures have taken place, the dinner is begun. At this point, the celebration reaches its peak; live musical groups begin playing music, keeping the guests entertained. The music is played while the guests dine, chat, mingle, and dance.
The next morning the family and closest friends may also attend a special breakfast, especially if they are staying with the family. Sometimes what is known as a (re-warming) takes place in which any food not consumed during the event of the night before is warmed again for a brunch type event.

=== Spain ===
Although the origin of the festival seems to have its cause in the ancient European aristocratic festival of the &quot;puesta de largo&quot; - or &quot;Debutante ball&quot; according to the nomenclature of foreign influence, in which young women of marriageable age were presented before society, this festival was always restricted to the upper classes in the peninsular kingdoms and in the 20th century its celebration age was delayed to coincide with the civil age of majority. Although it was exported to America, where it also took root among the popular classes, in Spain it gradually disappeared throughout the 20th century. However, the custom has been reintroduced again, although in a less formal version, as a result of Latin American immigration, whose members have applied it to their second generation. However, this version of the festival is not generally considered a custom typical of Spain, but rather exclusive to immigrants.

=== United States ===

While in most of the United States it is customary to celebrate a sweet sixteen, a is common amongst the large Mexican American population from California to Florida, as well as within the other Hispanic communities throughout the country and Puerto Rico. Quinceañeras were noted to be celebrated in the mid- to late 1970s in Los Angeles and San Diego and in the early 1980s in different parts of Texas. Though they may not have been widespread, many working-class families could afford because the and pitch in for the costs. In recent years, have gained popularity in the United States. Books and other publications about distributed in the United States increasingly include English versions to the original works in Spanish. This shows the increasing influence of Hispanic and Latino culture within the broader American culture. The increasing popularity of the celebration has begun to lead to an uptick in retailers and businesses catering directly to young Hispanic or Latina women.

Argentina

In Argentina, the XVs (or quinces) follow a similar structure but without the chambelanes or dances. There is also an &quot;after twelve list&quot; where people that aren&#x27;t that close with the quinceañera can come into the party and enjoy it but without being part of the symbolical experience of the xv.

== New traditions ==

In the 21st century, many girls create their own celebrations. Whereas traditional dresses were formal and usually white dresses only and are now more varied. Also, instead of having the traditional seven and seven , the may pick all or all . Traditionally, girls were not allowed to dance in public until turning 15, but this taboo has also receded significantly. The ceremony of the Changing of the Shoes has also been modified. Instead of wearing slippers before ceremonially exchanging them for high heels, a girl may decide to wear shoes compatible with the color and style of her dress instead of donning the traditional slippers.

<doc id="646219" wikidata="Q1012019" url="?curid=646219" title="Larkhall">
<text>Larkhall (, ) is a town in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, around southeast of Glasgow. It is twinned with Seclin in northern France.

Larkhall sits on high ground between the River Clyde to the East and the Avon Water to the West. Larkhall sits on the edge of the scenic Clyde valley and is a commuter town for Glasgow.
Larkhall had a population of 14,951 in the 2011 UK Census, and is a typical Scottish former industrial town. Traditionally a mining, weaving and textile area, most of Larkhall&#x27;s traditional industries have now closed down, including the Lanarkshire ironworks.

==Toponym==
The name Larkhall or &quot;Laverock Ha&quot; first appears in journals around 1620. The origins of the name are unknown, although Laverock is the Scots word for &quot;skylark&quot;. However, there is no evidence that the town is named after the bird. It is more likely that Laverock was a surname.
The name for Larkhall was originally a Scots word Laverockhaugh (&quot;Laverockha&quot;), which meant &quot;laverock&quot; - skylark and &quot;haugh&quot; - boggy/wet area.

==History==
One of the town&#x27;s most notable historical landmarks is the Morgan Glen viaduct standing over the Avon Water. The viaduct was built between 1898 and 1904 for the Caledonian Railway company by Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. It spans some , and at a height of , it is the tallest viaduct in Scotland. The viaduct is in a state of disrepair since the closure of the railway line in 1965 
and is closed to public access for safety reasons. In the 1990s, the viaduct was under the threat of dismantling but was protected by a local heritage group. The viaduct is Category B listed. It is currently on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland.

Glenview memorial fountain is a local fountain and artwork in the town, originally produced by the Saracen Foundry.

==Sport==
Because of the Protestant majority, residents mainly support Rangers F.C., to the point where it was noted in 2008 that the colour green—which is associated with that team&#x27;s rivals Celtic F.C.—is avoided by retailers. However, community leaders attributed any trouble to a small number of vandals.
A local authority study in 2017 found that sectarianism was not a major issue in the town.

The town has two Junior Football teams: Larkhall Thistle F.C. and Royal Albert F.C. although Royal Albert now play in Stonehouse, a neighbouring village while Larkhall Thistle play at Gasworks Park on Raploch Street. Royal Albert were once a full member of the Scottish Football League but now ply their trade, as do Larkhall Thistle, in the Third Division (fourth tier) of the West of Scotland Football League.

===Black Lady===
The black lady of Larkhall is a local ghost story. She was said to be the Indian servant of Captain Henry McNeil Hamilton, the last owner of Broomhill House () who was brought to Larkhall by Captain McNeil after one of his many seafaring voyages. She was happy with her new life but her ignorance of Scottish customs made her a social outcast. The Captain forbade her to leave Broomhill House during the day. Soon she was not seen at night either and the Captain claimed she had disappeared, but locals were suspicious. She is said to have returned, as her ghostly form appeared in the windows of Broomhill House and then later in Morgan Glen. The Captain is said to have died prematurely.

When Broomhill House fell into disrepair the door lintel was moved down to the Applebank public house on Millheugh road by a large group of men. The next day it was said to be found lying across the road from the public house. In the 1960s a team from the &quot;Tonight&quot; programme visited Larkhall as they tried to perform the first televised exorcism. The cameras were frozen over in fine weather and after filming finished the director was killed in a road crash on his way to another location. He was found with a fence post impaled in his heart.

<doc id="646223" wikidata="Q3174727" url="?curid=646223" title="Pigface">
<text>Pigface is an American industrial rock supergroup formed in 1990 by Martin Atkins and William Rieflin.

==History==
Pigface was formed from Ministry&#x27;s &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot; tour, which produced the &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Feel Like Showing Up&quot; live album and video. For the tour, Al Jourgensen brought Atkins, Nivek Ogre and Chris Connelly. Also on the tour was Rieflin, regular Ministry drummer at the time. While Atkins enjoyed the dynamic of playing with a second drummer, he felt that the lineup was capable of doing much more than being, what he has frequently called, &quot;a Ministry cover band.&quot; Once the tour was over, Atkins and Rieflin decided to continue working together and recruited several of their tourmates. Pigface was born with the intention of keeping a revolving-door style collaboration with many experimentally-minded musicians, many of whom, especially early on, had recorded for the influential industrial music record label Wax Trax!.

Trent Reznor was also an early partner, before Nine Inch Nails became a household name. &quot;Suck,&quot; co-written and sung by Reznor, was something of an underground hit, and Reznor later re-recorded the song for the &quot;Broken&quot; EP.

Rieflin left Pigface after the first tour, leaving Atkins as the sole founder of the group. With hundreds of musical collaborators to record and perform with Pigface, it has ensured that each album, tour, and song is unique. However, this practice has led to some negative criticism due to a perceived lack of continuity.

In 2009, Full Effect Records, a Detroit-based label, announced the signing of Pigface. The Pigface album, &quot;6&quot;, a collection of songs already recorded over the span of the previous five years, was released soon after the announcement was made. Unlike with the previous releases, there was no tour to support the album.

After a seven-year hiatus, Pigface returned for two Chicago performances in November 2016. The first was a rehearsal show held at Reggie&#x27;s on November 24. On November 25, the band performed at House of Blues: Chicago. Both shows saw the band performing with several first-time members as well as the return of members like Lesley Rankine, En Esch, Mary Byker, Curse Mackey, Dirk Flannigan and Fallon Bowman.

Several offshoot bands of Pigface, all smaller sized all-star groups featuring Martin Atkins as a common member, have released albums during the time Pigface was active. These bands include Murder, Inc., The Damage Manual, Ritalin, Martin Atkins And The Chicago Industrial League, Spasm, and The Love Interest.

In March 2019, Atkins announced that Pigface would tour again for the first time in fourteen years with thirteen dates scheduled for the East coast and Midwest in November 2019. On February 12, 2020, a larger, national tour was announced to be taking place throughout May, June and July of that year. However, on April 2, 2020, Atkins made the announcement that, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour had been canceled.

Rieflin died on March 24, 2020, from cancer at the age of 59.

<text>Secure multi-party computation (also known as secure computation, multi-party computation (MPC) or privacy-preserving computation) is a subfield of cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. Unlike traditional cryptographic tasks, where cryptography assures security and integrity of communication or storage and the adversary is outside the system of participants (an eavesdropper on the sender and receiver), the cryptography in this model protects participants&#x27; privacy from each other.

The foundation for secure multi-party computation started in the late 1970s with the work on mental poker, cryptographic work that simulates game playing/computational tasks over distances without requiring a trusted third party. Traditionally, cryptography was about concealing content, while this new type of computation and protocol is about concealing partial information about data while computing with the data from many sources, and correctly producing outputs. By the late 1980s, Michael Ben-Or, Shafi Goldwasser and Avi Wigderson, and independently David Chaum, Claude Crépeau, and Ivan Damgård, had published papers showing &quot;how to securely compute any function in the secure channels setting&quot;.

== History ==
Special purpose protocols for specific tasks started in the late 1970s. Later, secure computation was formally introduced as secure two-party computation (2PC) in 1982 (for the so-called Millionaires&#x27; Problem, a specific problem which is a Boolean predicate), and in generality (for any feasible computation) in 1986 by Andrew Yao. The area is also referred to as Secure Function Evaluation (SFE). The two party case was followed by a generalization to the multi-party by Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali, and Avi Wigderson. The computation is based on secret sharing of all the inputs and zero-knowledge proofs for a potentially malicious case, where the majority of honest players in the malicious adversary case assure that bad behavior is detected and the computation continues with the dishonest person eliminated or his input revealed. This work suggested the very basic general scheme to be followed by essentially all future multi-party protocols for secure computing. This work introduced an approach, known as GMW paradigm, for compiling a multi-party computation protocol which is secure against semi-honest adversaries to a protocol that is secure against malicious adversaries. This work was followed by the first robust secure protocol which tolerates faulty behavior graciously without revealing anyone&#x27;s output via a work which invented for this purpose the often used `share of shares idea&#x27; and a protocol that allows one of the parties to hide its input unconditionally. The GMW paradigm was considered to be inefficient for years because of huge overheads that it brings to the base protocol. However, it is shown that it is possible to achieve efficient protocols, and it makes this line of research even more interesting from a practical perspective. The above results are in a model where the adversary is limited to polynomial time computations, and it observes all communications, and therefore the model is called the `computational model&#x27;. Further, the protocol of oblivious transfer was shown to be complete for these tasks. The above results established that it is possible under the above variations to achieve secure computation when the majority of users are honest.

The next question to solve was the case of secure communication channels where the point-to-point communication is not available to the adversary; in this case it was shown that solutions can be achieved with up to 1/3 of the parties being misbehaving and malicious, and the solutions apply no cryptographic tools (since secure communication is available). Adding a broadcast channel allows the system to tolerate up to 1/2 misbehaving minority, whereas connectivity constraints on the communication graph were investigated in the book Perfectly Secure Message Transmission.

Over the years, the notion of general purpose multi-party protocols became a fertile area to investigate basic and general protocol issues properties on, such as universal composability or mobile adversary as in proactive secret sharing.

Since the late 2000s, and certainly since 2010 and on, the domain of general purpose protocols has moved to deal with efficiency improvements of the protocols with practical applications in mind. Increasingly efficient protocols for MPC have been proposed, and MPC can be now considered as a practical solution to various real-life problems (especially ones that only require linear sharing of the secrets and mainly local operations on the shares with not much interactions among the parties), such as distributed voting, private bidding and auctions, sharing of signature or decryption functions and private information retrieval. The first large-scale and practical application of multi-party computation was the execution of an electronic double auction in the Danish Sugar Beet Auction, which took place in January 2008. Obviously, both theoretical notions and investigations, and applied constructions are needed (e.g., conditions for moving MPC into part of day by day business was advocated and presented 
in).

In 2020, a number of companies working with secure-multiparty computation founded the MPC alliance with the goal of &quot;accelerate awareness, acceptance, and adoption of MPC technology.&quot;

== Definition and overview ==
In an MPC, a given number of participants, p1, p2, ..., pN, each have private data, respectively d1, d2, ..., dN. Participants want to compute the value of a public function on that private data: F(d1, d2, ..., dN) while keeping their own inputs secret.

For example, suppose we have three parties Alice, Bob and Charlie, with respective inputs x, y and z denoting their salaries. They want to find out the highest of the three salaries, without revealing to each other how much each of them makes. Mathematically, this translates to them computing:

If there were some trusted outside party (say, they had a mutual friend Tony who they knew could keep a secret), they could each tell their salary to Tony, he could compute the maximum, and tell that number to all of them. The goal of MPC is to design a protocol, where, by exchanging messages only with each other, Alice, Bob, and Charlie can still learn without revealing who makes what and without having to rely on Tony. They should learn no more by engaging in their protocol than they would learn by interacting with an incorruptible, perfectly trustworthy Tony.

In particular, all that the parties can learn is what they can learn from the output and their own input. So in the above example, if the output is , then Charlie learns that his is the maximum value, whereas Alice and Bob learn (if , and are distinct), that their input is not equal to the maximum, and that the maximum held is equal to . The basic scenario can be easily generalised to where the parties have several inputs and outputs, and the function outputs different values to different parties.

Informally speaking, the most basic properties that a multi-party computation protocol aims to ensure are:
* Input privacy: No information about the private data held by the parties can be inferred from the messages sent during the execution of the protocol. The only information that can be inferred about the private data is whatever could be inferred from seeing the output of the function alone.
* Correctness: Any proper subset of adversarial colluding parties willing to share information or deviate from the instructions during the protocol execution should not be able to force honest parties to output an incorrect result. This correctness goal comes in two flavours: either the honest parties are guaranteed to compute the correct output (a &quot;robust&quot; protocol), or they abort if they find an error (an MPC protocol &quot;with abort&quot;).

There are a wide range of practical applications, varying from simple tasks such as coin tossing to more complex ones like electronic auctions (e.g. compute the market clearing price), electronic voting, or privacy-preserving data mining. A classical example is the Millionaires&#x27; Problem: two millionaires want to know who is richer, in such a way that neither of them learns the net worth of the other. A solution to this situation is essentially to securely evaluate the comparison function.

== Security definitions ==

A multi-party computation protocol must be secure to be effective. In modern cryptography, the security of a protocol is related to a security proof. The security proof is a mathematical proof where the security of a protocol is reduced to that of the security of its underlying primitives. Nevertheless, it is not always possible to formalize the cryptographic protocol security verification based on the party knowledge and the protocol correctness. For MPC protocols, the environment in which the protocol operates is associated with the Real World/Ideal World Paradigm. The parties can&#x27;t be said to learn nothing, since they need to learn the output of the operation, and the output depends on the inputs. In addition, the output correctness is not guaranteed, since the correctness of the output depends on the parties’ inputs, and the inputs have to be assumed to be correct.

The Real World/Ideal World Paradigm states two worlds: (i) In the ideal-world model, there exists an incorruptible trusted party to whom each protocol participant sends its input. This trusted party computes the function on its own and sends back the appropriate output to each party. (ii) In contrast, in the real-world model, there is no trusted party and all the parties can do is to exchange messages with each other. A protocol is said to be secure if one can learn no more about each party&#x27;s private inputs in the real world than one could learn in the ideal world. In the ideal world, no messages are exchanged between parties, so real-world exchanged messages cannot reveal any secret information.

The Real World/Ideal World Paradigm provides a simple abstraction of the complexities of MPC to allow the construction of an application under the pretense that the MPC protocol at its core is actually an ideal execution. If the application is secure in the ideal case, then it is also secure when a real protocol is run instead.

The security requirements on an MPC protocol are stringent. Nonetheless, in 1987 it was demonstrated that any function can be securely computed, with security for malicious adversaries and the other initial works mentioned before.
Despite these publications, MPC was not designed to be efficient enough to be used in practice at that time. Unconditionally or information-theoretically secure MPC is closely related and builds on to the problem of secret sharing, and more specifically verifiable secret sharing (VSS), which many secure MPC protocols use against active adversaries.

Unlike traditional cryptographic applications, such as encryption or signature, one must assume that the adversary in an MPC protocol is one of the players engaged in the system (or controlling internal parties). That corrupted party or parties may collude in order to breach the security of the protocol. Let formula_1 be the number of parties in the protocol and formula_2 the number of parties who can be adversarial. The protocols and solutions for the case of formula_3 (i.e., when an honest majority is assumed) are different from those where no such assumption is made. This latter case includes the important case of two-party computation where one of the participants may be corrupted, and the general case where an unlimited number of participants are corrupted and collude to attack the honest participants.

Adversaries faced by the different protocols can be categorized according to how willing they are to deviate from the protocol. There are essentially two types of adversaries, each giving rise to different forms of security (and each fits into different real world scenario):
* Semi-Honest (Passive) Security: In this case, it is assumed that corrupted parties merely cooperate to gather information out of the protocol, but do not deviate from the protocol specification. This is a naive adversary model, yielding weak security in real situations. However, protocols achieving this level of security prevent inadvertent leakage of information between (otherwise collaborating) parties, and are thus useful if this is the only concern. In addition, protocols in the semi-honest model are quite efficient, and are often an important first step for achieving higher levels of security.
* Malicious (Active) Security: In this case, the adversary may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol execution in its attempt to cheat. Protocols that achieve security in this model provide a very high security guarantee. In the case of majority of misbehaving parties: The only thing that an adversary can do in the case of dishonest majority is to cause the honest parties to &quot;abort&quot; having detected cheating. If the honest parties do obtain output, then they are guaranteed that it is correct. Their privacy is always preserved.

Security against active adversaries typically leads to a reduction in efficiency. Covert security is an alternative that aims to allow greater efficiency in exchange for weakening the security definition; it is applicable to situations where active adversaries are willing to cheat but only if they are not caught. For example, their reputation could be damaged, preventing future collaboration with other honest parties. Thus, protocols that are covertly secure provide mechanisms to ensure that, if some of the parties do not follow the instructions, then it will be noticed with high probability, say 75% or 90%. In a way, covert adversaries are active ones forced to act passively due to external non-cryptographic (e.g. business) concerns. This mechanism sets a bridge between both models in the hope of finding protocols which are efficient and secure enough in practice.

Like many cryptographic protocols, the security of an MPC protocol can rely on different assumptions:
* It can be computational (i.e. based on some mathematical problem, like factoring) or unconditional, namely relying on physical unavailability of messages on channels (usually with some probability of error which can be made arbitrarily small).
* The model might assume that participants use a synchronized network, where a message sent at a &quot;tick&quot; always arrives at the next &quot;tick&quot;, or that a secure and reliable broadcast channel exists, or that a secure communication channel exists between every pair of participants where an adversary cannot read, modify or generate messages in the channel, etc.

The set of honest parties that can execute a computational task is related to the concept of access structure. Adversary structures can be static, where the adversary chooses its victims before the start of the multi-party computation, or dynamic, where it chooses its victims during the course of execution of the multi-party computation making the defense harder. An adversary structure can be defined as a threshold structure or as a more complex structure. In a threshold structure the adversary can corrupt or read the memory of a number of participants up to some threshold. Meanwhile, in a complex structure it can affect certain predefined subsets of participants, modeling different possible collusions.

== Protocols ==

There are major differences between the protocols proposed for two party computation (2PC) and multi-party computation (MPC). Also, often for special purpose protocols of importance a specialized protocol that deviates from the generic ones has to be designed (voting, auctions, payments, etc.)

=== Two-party computation ===
The two party setting is particularly interesting, not only from an applications perspective but also because special techniques can be applied in the two party setting which do not apply in the multi-party case. Indeed, secure multi-party computation (in fact the restricted case of secure function evaluation, where only a single function is evaluated) was first presented in the two-party setting. The original work is often cited as being from one of the two papers of Yao; although the papers do not actually contain what is now known as Yao&#x27;s garbled circuit protocol.

Yao&#x27;s basic protocol is secure against semi-honest adversaries and is extremely efficient in terms of number of rounds, which is constant, and independent of the target function being evaluated. The function is viewed as a Boolean circuit, with inputs in binary of fixed length. A Boolean circuit is a collection of gates connected with three different types of wires: circuit-input wires, circuit-output wires and intermediate wires. Each gate receives two input wires and it has a single output wire which might be fan-out (i.e. be passed to multiple gates at the next level). Plain evaluation of the circuit is done by evaluating each gate in turn; assuming the gates have been topologically ordered. The gate is represented as a truth table such that for each possible pair of bits (those coming from the input wires&#x27; gate) the table assigns a unique output bit; which is the value of the output wire of the gate. The results of the evaluation are the bits obtained in the circuit-output wires.

Yao explained how to garble a circuit (hide its structure) so that two parties, sender and receiver, can learn the output of the circuit and nothing else. At a high level, the sender prepares the garbled circuit and sends it to the receiver, who obliviously evaluates the circuit, learning the encodings corresponding to both his and the sender&#x27;s output. He then just sends back the sender&#x27;s encodings, allowing the sender to compute his part of the output. The sender sends the mapping from the receivers output encodings to bits to the receiver, allowing the receiver to obtain their output.

In more detail, the garbled circuit is computed as follows. The main ingredient is a double-keyed symmetric encryption scheme. Given a gate of the circuit, each possible value of its input wires (either 0 or 1) is encoded with a random number (label). The values resulting from the evaluation of the gate at each of the four possible pair of input bits are also replaced with random labels. The garbled truth table of the gate consists of encryptions of each output label using its inputs labels as keys. The position of these four encryptions in the truth table is randomized so no information on the gate is leaked.

To correctly evaluate each garbled gate the encryption scheme has the following two properties. Firstly, the ranges of the encryption function under any two distinct keys are disjoint (with overwhelming probability). The second property says that it can be checked efficiently whether a given ciphertext has been encrypted under a given key. With these two properties the receiver, after obtaining the labels for all circuit-input wires, can evaluate each gate by first finding out which of the four ciphertexts has been encrypted with his label keys, and then decrypting to obtain the label of the output wire. This is done obliviously as all the receiver learns during the evaluation are encodings of the bits.

The sender&#x27;s (i.e. circuit creators) input bits can be just sent as encodings to the evaluator; whereas the receiver&#x27;s (i.e. circuit evaluators) encodings corresponding to his input bits are obtained via a 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer (OT) protocol. A 1-out-of-2 OT protocol enables the sender possessing of two values C1 and C2 to send the one requested by the receiver (b a value in {1,2}) in such a way that the sender does not know what value has been transferred, and the receiver only learns the queried value.

If one is considering malicious adversaries, further mechanisms to ensure correct behavior of both parties need to be provided. By construction it is easy to show security for the sender if the OT protocol is already secure against malicious adversary, as all the receiver can do is to evaluate a garbled circuit that would fail to reach the circuit-output wires if he deviated from the instructions. The situation is very different on the sender&#x27;s side. For example, he may send an incorrect garbled circuit that computes a function revealing the receiver&#x27;s input. This would mean that privacy no longer holds, but since the circuit is garbled the receiver would not be able to detect this. However, it is possible to efficiently apply Zero-Knowledge proofs to make this protocol secure against malicious adversaries with a small overhead comparing to the semi-honest protocol.

=== Multi-party protocols ===
Most MPC protocols, as opposed to 2PC protocols and especially under the unconditional setting of private channels, make use of secret sharing. In the secret sharing based methods, the parties do not play special roles (as in Yao, of creator and evaluator). Instead, the data associated with each wire is shared amongst the parties, and a protocol is then used to evaluate each gate. The function is now defined as a &quot;circuit&quot; over a finite field, as opposed to the binary circuits used for Yao. Such a circuit is called an arithmetic circuit in the literature, and it consists of addition and multiplication &quot;gates&quot; where the values operated on are defined over a finite field.

Secret sharing allows one to distribute a secret among a number of parties by distributing shares to each party. Two types of secret sharing schemes are commonly used; Shamir secret sharing and additive secret sharing. In both cases the shares are random elements of a finite field that add up to the secret in the field; intuitively, security is achieved because any non-qualifying set of shares looks randomly distributed.

Secret sharing schemes can tolerate an adversary controlling up to &quot;t&quot; parties out of &quot;n&quot; total parties, where &quot;t&quot; varies based on the scheme, the adversary can be passive or active, and different assumptions are made on the power of the adversary. The Shamir secret sharing scheme is secure against a passive adversary when formula_4 and an active adversary when formula_5 while achieving information-theoretic security, meaning that even if the adversary has unbounded computational power, they cannot learn any information about the secret underlying a share. The BGW protocol, which defines how to compute addition and multiplication on secret shares, is often used to compute functions with Shamir secret shares. Additive secret sharing schemes can tolerate the adversary controlling all but one party, that is formula_6, while maintaining security against a passive and active adversary with unbounded computational power. Some protocols require a setup phase, which may only be secure against a computationally bounded adversary.

A number of systems have implemented various forms of MPC with secret sharing schemes. The most popular is SPDZ, which implements MPC with additive secret shares and is secure against active adversaries.

=== Other protocols ===

In 2014 a &quot;model of fairness in secure computation in which an adversarial party that aborts on receiving output is forced to pay a mutually predefined monetary penalty&quot; has been described for the Bitcoin network or for fair lottery, and has been successfully implemented in Ethereum.

== Practical MPC systems ==
Many advances have been made on 2PC and MPC systems in recent years.

=== Yao-based protocols ===
One of the main issues when working with Yao-based protocols is that the function to be securely evaluated (which could be an arbitrary program) must be represented as a circuit, usually consisting of XOR and AND gates. Since most real-world programs contain loops and complex data structures, this is a highly non-trivial task. The Fairplay system was the first tool designed to tackle this problem. Fairplay comprises two main components. The first of these is a compiler enabling users to write programs in a simple high-level language, and output these programs in a Boolean circuit representation. The second component can then garble the circuit and execute a protocol to securely evaluate the garbled circuit. As well as two-party computation based on Yao&#x27;s protocol, Fairplay can also carry out multi-party protocols. This is done using the BMR protocol, which extends Yao&#x27;s passively secure protocol to the active case.

In the years following the introduction of Fairplay, many improvements to Yao&#x27;s basic protocol have been created, in the form of both efficiency improvements and techniques for active security. These include techniques such as the free XOR method, which allows for much simpler evaluation of XOR gates, and garbled row reduction, reducing the size of garbled tables with two inputs by 25%.

The approach that so far seems to be the most fruitful in obtaining active security comes from a combination of the garbling technique and the &quot;cut-and-choose&quot; paradigm. This combination seems to render more efficient constructions. To avoid the aforementioned problems with respect to dishonest behaviour, many garblings of the same circuit are sent from the constructor to the evaluator. Then around half of them (depending on the specific protocol) are opened to check consistency, and if so a vast majority of the unopened ones are correct with high probability. The output is the majority vote of all the evaluations. Here the majority output is needed. If there is disagreement on the outputs the receiver knows the sender is cheating, but he cannot complain as otherwise this would leak information on his input.

This approach for active security was initiated by Lindell and Pinkas. This technique was implemented by Pinkas et al. in 2009, This provided the first actively secure two-party evaluation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) circuit, regarded as a highly complex (consisting of around 30,000 AND and XOR gates), non-trivial function (also with some potential applications), taking around 20 minutes to compute and requiring 160 circuits to obtain a formula_7 cheating probability.

As many circuits are evaluated, the parties (including the receiver) need to commit to their inputs to ensure that in all the iterations the same values are used. The experiments of Pinkas et al. reported show that the bottleneck of the protocol lies in the consistency checks. They had to send over the net about 6,553,600 commitments to various values to evaluate the AES circuit. In recent results the efficiency of actively secure Yao-based implementations was improved even further, requiring only 40 circuits, and a much smaller number of commitments, to obtain formula_7 cheating probability. The improvements come from new methodologies for performing cut-and-choose on the transmitted circuits.

More recently, there has been a focus on highly parallel implementations based on garbled circuits, designed to be run on CPUs with many cores. Kreuter, et al. describe an implementation running on 512 cores of a powerful cluster computer. Using these resources they could evaluate the 4095-bit edit distance function, whose circuit comprises almost 6 billion gates. To accomplish this they developed a custom, better optimized circuit compiler than Fairplay and several new optimizations such as pipelining, whereby transmission of the garbled circuit across the network begins while the rest of the circuit is still being generated. The time to compute AES was reduced to 1.4 seconds per block in the active case, using a 512-node cluster machine, and 115 seconds using one node. Shelat and Shen improve this, using commodity hardware, to 0.52 seconds per block. The same paper reports on a throughput of 21 blocks per second, but with a latency of 48 seconds per block.

Meanwhile, another group of researchers has investigated using consumer-grade GPUs to achieve similar levels of parallelism. They utilize oblivious transfer extensions and some other novel techniques to design their GPU-specific protocol. This approach seems to achieve comparable efficiency to the cluster computing implementation, using a similar number of cores. However, the authors only report on an implementation of the AES circuit, which has around 50,000 gates. On the other hand, the hardware required here is far more accessible, as similar devices may already be found in many people&#x27;s desktop computers or games consoles. The authors obtain a timing of 2.7 seconds per AES block on a standard desktop, with a standard GPU. If they allow security to decrease to something akin to covert security, they obtain a run time of 0.30 seconds per AES block. In the passive security case there are reports of processing of circuits with 250 million gates, and at a rate of 75 million gates per second.

== Implementations of secure multi-party computation data analyses ==
One of the primary applications of secure multi-party computation is allowing analysis of data that is held by multiple parties, or blind analysis of data by third parties without allowing the data custodian to understand the kind of data analysis being performed.

<doc id="646238" wikidata="Q352059" url="?curid=646238" title="Robin Cook (American novelist)">
<text>Robert Brian &quot;Robin&quot; Cook (born May 4, 1940) is an American physician and novelist who writes largely about medicine and topics affecting public health.

He is known best for combining medical writing with the thriller genre. Many of his books have been bestsellers on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List. Several of his books have also been featured by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. His books have sold nearly 400 million copies worldwide.

==Early life and career==
Cook was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in Woodside, Queens. He relocated to Leonia, New Jersey when he was eight years old, where he could first have the &quot;luxury&quot; of having his own room. He graduated from Leonia High School in 1958.

Subsequently, Cook graduated from Wesleyan University and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and finished his postgraduate medical training at Harvard.

Cook managed the Cousteau Society&#x27;s blood-gas laboratory in the south of France. He later became an aquanaut (a submarine doctor) with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s SEALAB program when he was drafted in 1969. Cook served in the Navy from 1969 to 1971, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander. He wrote his first novel, &quot;Year of the Intern&quot;, while serving aboard the Polaris-type submarine .

==Novelist==
&quot;The Year of the Intern&quot;, was a failure, but Cook began to study bestsellers. He said, &quot;I studied how the reader was manipulated by the writer. I came up with a list of techniques that I wrote down on index cards. And I used every one of them in &quot;Coma&quot;.&quot; He conceived the idea for &quot;Coma&quot;, about creating illegally a supply of transplant organs, in 1975. In March 1977, that novel&#x27;s paperback rights sold for $800,000. It was followed by the Egyptology thriller &quot;Sphinx&quot; in 1979 and another medical thriller, &quot;Brain&quot;, in 1981. Cook then decided he preferred writing rather than a medical career.

Cook&#x27;s novels combine medical fact with fantasy. His medical thrillers are designed, in part, to keep the public aware of both the technological possibilities of modern medicine and the socio-ethical problems associated with it. Cook says he chose to write thrillers because they give him &quot;an opportunity to get the public interested in things about medicine that they didn&#x27;t seem to know about. I believe my books are actually teaching people.&quot;

The author admits he never thought that he would have such compelling material to work with when he began writing fiction in 1970. &quot;If I tried to be the writer I am today a number of years ago, I wouldn&#x27;t have very much to write about. But today, with the pace of change in biomedical research, there are any number of different issues, and new ones to come,&quot; he says.

Cook&#x27;s novels have anticipated national controversy. In an interview with Stephen McDonald about the novel &quot;Shock&quot;, Cook admitted the book&#x27;s timing was fortuitous:
To date, Cook has fictionalized issues such as organ donation, fertility treatment, genetic engineering, &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization, research funding, managed care, medical malpractice, medical tourism, drug research, and organ transplantation.

Many of his novels concern hospitals (both fictional and non-fictional) in Boston, which may have to do with the fact that he had his post-graduate training at Harvard and lives in Boston, and/ or in New York.

===Personal life===
He is on leave from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.

Cook is a private member of the Woodrow Wilson Center&#x27;s Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees, directed by chairman Joseph B. Gildenhorn, are appointed to six-year terms by the President of the United States.

<text>The Subaru Pleo is a kei car made by the Japanese automaker Subaru since 1998.

The Pleo is taller than conventional kei car hatchbacks, but shorter than the definitive microvan, the Suzuki Wagon R, and is available with a variety of 658 cc I4 engines: SOHC, DOHC, and supercharged in two different trim levels. It competes with the Honda Life, Daihatsu Move, and the Mitsubishi Toppo in the tall wagon segment of &quot;kei&quot; cars in Japan.

The name &quot;&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;to fill&quot; or &quot;to fulfill.&quot;

==First generation – RA1/RA2/RV1/RV2 (1998-2009)==
The first-generation Pleo first went on sale in Japan on October 9, 1998, replacing the Vivio (a conventional kei car hatchback), when Japanese regulations dictated a size change in the kei car tax bracket, and every kei car model from every make was redesigned as a result. The car was available with three variations of the EN07 engine; a naturally aspirated one with , a sporty supercharged one with , and also a &quot;mildcharged&quot; version which aimed for power characteristics similar to those of a one-liter car. The mildcharged version has a supercharger (with lower boost pressure) and . The original television advertisement for the Pleo broadcast nationally across Japan throughout the fourth quarter of 1998 featured a hip hop remix for the aria &quot;Un bel dì vedremo&quot; from the opera &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; by Italian composer Giacomo Puccini as its background music. The Vivio continued to be sold alongside the Pleo until the Vivio was discontinued on October 31.

In June 1999, Subaru launched a retro-styled and better equipped edition of the Pleo, called the Nesta. This has a whole new front design, including new fenders, to accommodate a chromed grille and (twin) round headlights. It featured the entire engine range of the Pleo. In October, a sporty edition was launched, called the LS. At the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show, an LPG-powered prototype with a modernized version of the Nesta&#x27;s front end was shown, with the name &quot;Pleo Nicot,&quot; (stylized as NiCOT) although it was not to enter production for another year. In December, an Le edition was launched.

In May 2000, Subaru launched a G Edition of the Pleo Nesta. In October, the first facelifted edition was launched. In December, the cheery-looking model called the Pleo Nicot was finally launched. Using single round headlights and a small smile-shaped grille, it used the Nesta&#x27;s model-specific front fenders in a more modern way. The only engine option was the (gasoline-powered) mildcharged version.

In May 2001, a more upgraded sporty version of the Pleo was launched, called the RS. This model is sometimes called the RM. In October, a second facelifted edition was launched.

In January 2002, the L Plus Package and F Special editions were both launched. In May, three four-wheel drive editions, the RS Limited II, the LS Limited and the F Limited, were launched to commemorate Subaru 4WD&#x27;s fortieth anniversary. In October, a third facelifted edition was launched.

In May 2003, four editions of the Pleo, the FS Limited, the FS Special, the L Special and the Nesta GS Special, were launched. In June, the RS Limited and LS Limited were both facelifted. Meanwhile, a new edition of the Pleo, the L Special Color Selection, was launched. The R2, was introduced on December 8. After 2003, the Pleo was sold alongside the R2. As of January 2004, the supercharged engines were no longer available, leaving only the naturally aspirated version as the Pleo was repositioned beneath Subaru&#x27;s newer kei class offerings. The mildcharged option returned twelve months later, only to disappear definitely in June 2006, after the Stella&#x27;s introduction.

In June 2007, the F model was discontinued. The discontinuation left the Van A model as the only trim level.

In December 2009, the Pleo was discontinued.

==Second generation - L275F/L285F/L275B/L285B (2010-2018)==
The second-generation Pleo first went on sale in Japan on April 20, 2010. Due to Subaru&#x27;s corporate investment by Toyota, this second generation is manufactured by Daihatsu instead of Subaru, and is a rebadged Daihatsu Mira.

<text>The Last Starship from Earth is a 1968 science fiction novel by John Boyd, and is his best known novel.

== Setting ==
The novel is set in a dystopian society in the very near future. Although it is not obvious at first, this is also an alternate history story.

In this world, instead of preaching peace and forgiveness and being crucified, Jesus became a revolutionary agitator and assembled an army to overthrow the Roman Empire, establishing a theocracy before being killed by a crossbow, which becomes a religious symbol similar to the cross in our timeline. The regime established by Jesus continues to the present day, having dominated the entire world and mingled with scientific ideas and advanced technology, including a Church led by an AI pope.

Marriage and mating are related to genes, so there is a strong system of castes.

==Plot summary==
The central character is Haldane IV, a mathematician who forms a caste-forbidden relationship with Helix, a poetess. He also becomes interested in investigating Fairweather, a famous mathematician who lived shortly before his time, and his son Fairweather II, whom he discovers led a failed rebellion.

Haldane and Helix are discovered and there is a show trial, which results in Haldane being exiled to &quot;Hell&quot; (a planet orbiting a distant star), where he meets Fairweather II and is reunited with Helix. It is revealed that Helix is Fairweather II&#x27;s daughter; Fairweather II needed a mathematician for his time machine, and Helix was sent to Earth to engineer the exile of a mathematician to pilot an experimental time machine. Fairweather II makes Haldane immortal and sends him on a mission to go back in time and kill Jesus under his new name, &quot;Judas Iscariot&quot;.

In an epilogue, Haldane captures Jesus, puts him in the time machine and sends him back. He returns to the present day, which is much more similar to our timeline, and meets a girl who is very similar to Helix.

==Trilogy==
The book is supposedly the first in a trilogy. The other books appear to be &quot;The Pollinators of Eden&quot;, and &quot;The Rakehells of Heaven&quot;.

==Critical response==
Robert A. Heinlein said, &quot;It belongs on the same shelf with &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;,&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted, &quot;In the literate tradition of Huxley, Orwell, and Bradbury, it is a work of extraordinary impact.&quot; Joanna Russ, in her review of the book in 1969, was highly critical and wrote, &quot;I forgive Mr. Boyd the anguish his novel caused me and hope he will eventually forgive me the anguish this review may cause him, but for Berkley there is no forgiveness. Only reform. Don&#x27;t do it again.&quot;

Spider Robinson, however, praised the novel as &quot;delightful, with a rigorously consistent internal logic that doesn&#x27;t really become apparent until the very last chapter.&quot;

<text>A forming press, commonly shortened to press, is a machine tool that changes the shape of a work-piece by the application of pressure. The operator of a forming press is known as a press-tool setter, often shortened to tool-setter.

Presses can be classified according to
* their mechanism: hydraulic, mechanical, pneumatic;
* their function: forging presses, stamping presses, press brakes, punch press, etc.
* their structure, e.g. Knuckle-joint press, screw press, Expeller press
* their controllability: conventional vs. servo-presses

==Shop Press==
Typically consisting of a simple rectangular frame, often fabricated from C-channel or tubing, containing a bottle jack or hydraulic cylinder to apply pressure via a ram to a work-piece. Often used for general-purpose forming work in the auto mechanic shop, machine shop, garage or basement shops, etc. Typical shop presses are capable of applying between 1 and 30 tons pressure, depending on size and construction. Lighter-duty versions are often called arbor presses.

A shop press is commonly used to press interference fit parts together, such as gears onto shafts or bearings into housings.

==Other presses by application==
* A press brake is a special type of machine press that bends sheet metal into shape. A good example of the type of work a press brake can do is the back-plate of a computer case. Other examples include brackets, frame pieces and electronic enclosures. Some press brakes have CNC controls and can form parts with accuracy to a fraction of a millimeter. Bending forces can range up to 3,000 tons.
* A punch press is used to form holes.
* A screw press is also known as a fly press.
* A stamping press is a machine press used to shape or cut metal by deforming it with a die. It generally consists of a press frame, a bolster plate, and a ram.
* Capping presses form caps from rolls of aluminium foil at up to 660 per minute.

==An example of peculiar press control: servo-press==
A servomechanism press, also known as a &quot;servo press&quot; or an &quot;&#x27;electro-press&quot;, is a press driven by an AC servo motor. The torque produced is converted to a linear force via a ball screw. Pressure and position are controlled through a load cell and an encoder. The main advantage of a servo press is its low energy consumption; its only 10-20% of other press machines.

When stamping, it is really about maximizing energy as opposed to how the machine can deliver tonnage. Up until recently, the way to increase tonnage between the die and work-piece on a mechanical press was through bigger machines with bigger motors.

==Types of presses==

The press style used is in direct correlation to the end product. Press types are straight-side, BG (back geared), geared, gap, OBI (open back inclinable) and OBS (open back stationary). Hydraulic and mechanical presses are classified by the frame the moving elements are mounted on. The most common are the gap-frame, also known as C-frame, and the straight-side press. A straight-side press has vertical columns on either side of the machine and eliminates angular deflection. A C-frame allows easy access to the die area on three sides and require less floor space. A type of gap-frame, the OBI pivots the frame for easier scrap or part discharge. The OBS timed air blasts, devices or conveyor for scrap or part discharge.

==History==

Historically, metal was shaped by hand using a hammer. Later, larger hammers were constructed to press more metal at once, or to press thicker materials. Often a smith would employ a helper or apprentice to swing the hammer while the smith concentrated on positioning the work-piece. Drop hammers and trip hammers utilize a mechanism to lift the hammer, which then falls by gravity onto the work.

In the mid 19th century, manual and rotary-cam hammers began to be replaced in industry by the steam hammer, which was first described in 1784 by James Watt, a British inventor and Mechanical Engineer who also contributed to the earliest steam engines and condensers, but not built until 1840 by British inventor James Nasmyth. By the late 19th century, steam hammers had increased greatly in size; in 1891 the Bethlehem Iron Company made an enhancement allowing a steam hammer to deliver a 125-ton blow.

Most modern machine presses typically use a combination of electric motors and hydraulics to achieve the necessary pressure. Along with the evolution of presses came the evolution of the dies used within them.

==Safety==
Machine presses can be hazardous, so safety measures must always be taken. Bi-manual controls (controls the use of which requires both hands to be on the buttons to operate) are a very good way to prevent accidents, as are light curtains that keep the machine from working if the operator is in range of the die.

<text>Mitch Davis is an American film director, writer, and producer noted for his 2001 film &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot; about the trials and adventures of a missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), John H. Groberg. His movies range from intense dramas to lighthearted, family-friendly comedies. He has written seven films, directed five, and produced three. He is from Escondido, California. He attended Brigham Young University (BYU) and the University of Southern California.

== Personal life ==
Davis is a member of the LDS Church. He served as a missionary for the church in Córdoba, Argentina in the 1970s and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1982. It was in an introduction to film class at BYU where Davis first watched &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life,&quot; the film that showed him the impact movies could have on the lives of individuals. He described it as &quot;a spiritual experience,&quot; saying that, after watching it, he &quot;walked around campus in a daze...that movie just made me want to be a better person.&quot; His goal in film making is to uplift and inspire on a global scale. Davis later attended the University of Southern California and graduated with a Master of Arts degree in film production in 1989. He is married to Michelle Davis, and has two sons and two daughters.

== Professional career ==
After graduating from BYU, Davis first worked as a mainframe computer salesman. While attending graduate school, Davis worked as an intern at Disney. He went on to become a creative executive, working on films such as &quot;Dead Poet’s Society&quot; (1989), &quot;White Fang&quot; (1991), &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (1991), and &quot;Newsies&quot; (1992). Davis wrote the screenplay for the Disney Channel film &quot;Windrunner&quot; (1994). He then worked as Vice President of Development of Columbia’s Cash &amp; Epps Entertainment company.

While working as a screenwriter, Davis realized how much directors and producers could change his original work. He became a director and producer to ensure that his films would be released how he originally envisioned them. He explained: &quot;That&#x27;s how I became a filmmaker top to bottom; I was kind of backed into it.&quot;

Davis was struck by lightning while on a camping trip in Colorado. This near-death experience motivated him to begin production on &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot;. It was inspired by Groberg&#x27;s book, &quot;In the Eye of the Storm&quot;. Davis and his family moved to the Cook Islands to make the film. There, Davis worked alongside producer Gerald R. Molen and John Garbett. It was released on December 14, 2001. More than three million copies of the film have been sold; about 200 million people worldwide have seen it. Davis stated that the film was &quot;played in nearly every majority-Muslim country in the world.&quot;

After &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot;, he wrote and directed &quot;Language of the Enemy&quot; (originally entitled &quot;A House Divided&quot;), a story about an American Jewish man&#x27;s travel to Israel and his subsequent romantic relationship with a Palestinian woman. Davis then wrote a three-part documentary series for BYUtv entitled &quot;Fires of Faith: The Coming Forth of the King James Bible&quot;, a historical piece featuring figures such as William Tyndale, Martin Luther, and King Henry VIII. He continued with BYUtv to write another documentary about Handel&#x27;s Messiah in 2014. In 2015 he wrote, directed, and produced &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, a family holiday comedy starring Sir Patrick Stewart. In 2017 he released &quot;The Stray&quot;, which showcased his own life experience. Davis co-wrote the PBS docudrama &quot;Joseph Smith: American Prophet&quot; in 2017, a remake of the 1999 film of the same name.

&quot;The Other Side of Heaven 2: Fire of Faith&quot;, a sequel to the previous film, was released on June 28, 2019. It is set 10 years after the original, and tells the story of Groberg&#x27;s return to Tonga with his family.

Davis has released a book entitled &quot;Journey of Faith: The Making of the Other Side of Heaven&quot;, with Molen and Garbett as co-authors. &quot;The Other Side of Heaven: The Screenplay&quot; is also available.

<doc id="646264" wikidata="Q3529376" url="?curid=646264" title="Marksman">
<text>A marksman is a person who is skilled in precision shooting. In modern military usage this typically refers to the use of projectile weapons such as an accurized scoped long gun such as designated marksman rifle (or a sniper rifle) to shoot at high-value targets at longer-than-usual ranges.

The proficiency in precision shooting is known as a shooter&#x27;s marksmanship, which can be used to describe both gunnery and archery.

==Description==
In common usage, &quot;sharpshooter&quot; and &quot;marksman&quot; are synonymous. Within the specialized fields of shooting sports and military usage, however, sharpshooter and marksman each refer to different levels of skill. Specifically, in the US Army, &quot;marksman&quot; is a rating below &quot;sharpshooter&quot; and &quot;expert&quot;. Four levels of skill are generally recognized today in American military and civilian shooting circles: unqualified, marksman, sharpshooter, and expert. Marksmanship badges for the three qualified levels are commonly awarded to both civilian and military shooters who attain proficiency in shooting higher than &quot;unqualified&quot;.

The main difference between military marksmen and snipers is that marksmen are usually considered an organic part of a fireteam of soldiers and are never expected to operate independently away from the main force, whereas snipers are special ops troops who usually work alone or in very small teams with independent mission objectives. Snipers are also often tasked with responsibilities other than delivering long-range firespecifically, conducting reconnaissance, battle damage assessment and spotting for coordinates/corrections for artillery fire or air strikes. Within the military, marksmen are sometimes attached to an infantry fireteam or squad (where they are known as designated marksmen) where they support the squad by providing accurate long-range shots at valuable targets as needed, thus extending the effective tactical reach of the fireteam or squad.

== Middle Ages ==
In the Middle Ages, in the first use of the term &#x27;marksman&#x27; was given to the royal archers, or bowmen, of a palace guard, which was an elite group of troops chosen to guard a royal palace or the royalty. This was around the 10th century, although records of some 9th century English Kings show the listings of groups of marksmen specifically chosen for their militaries. 

==Marksmen in different countries==

===Australia===
In the Australian Army, marksmanship is currently recognized by the award of one of three skill-at-arms badges. The &#x27;Skill at Arms Badge&#x27; consists of a representation of crossed .303 Short Magazine Lee–Enfield (SMLE) rifles and is awarded for achieving a prescribed standard of shooting skill. This must be repeated within twelve months for the badge to be awarded in perpetuity to the recipient. The &#x27;Sniper&#x27;s Badge&#x27; is similar in design but incorporates the letter &#x27;S&#x27; into the design and is awarded to soldiers who qualify on the Army Sniper&#x27;s Course. The &#x27;Army Top 20 Badge&#x27; consists of crossed .303 SMLE rifles upon a laurel wreath and is awarded to the final 20 competitors in the annual Champion Shot for the Army. The winner of this competition is also awarded the Champion Shots Medal. Only one badge may be worn.

===United Kingdom===
In the British Armed Forces, &quot;marksman&quot; is traditionally the highest shooting rating and holders may wear a crossed rifles badge on the lower sleeve.
:From Army Operational Shooting Policy for the Annual Personal Weapons Test (APWT) Combat Infantryman (CI):Marksman (Combat Infantryman). To qualify for Marksman all practices are to be completed and the firer must achieve a score of 55 (85%) or more of the total Highest Possible Score (65) for the entire shoot. Soldiers achieving a non-marksman passing score are &quot;not&quot; permitted to re-shoot practices in order to qualify for Marksman. Infantry soldiers who qualify as Marksmen during the Combat Infantryman&#x27;s Course (CIC) are entitled to retain the award on joining their units. Soldiers who qualify as Marksmen are entitled to wear the Marksman badge for one year before they must requalify. (Page 3 - 70, Amdt 1/Feb/07)

===United States===

In the United States Army and Marine Corps, the marksmanship of the soldiers is ranked based on their skill: marksman-sharpshooter-expert. Holders of each level wear qualification badges below their ribbons with bars for the weapons they qualify in. In the United States Navy and the United States Coast Guard, full-sized medals are only issued at the expert level. Both services award separate medals for pistol and rifle proficiency. The United States Air Force gives just a ribbon for qualifying at the expert level, although a bronze star can be earned if the wearer qualifies on both of these types of small arms.

Within the United States military, a marksman in the U.S. Army is referred to as &quot;Squad Designated Marksman&quot; (SDM), and a marksman in the Marines is called a &quot;Designated Marksman&quot; (DM). The United States Army particularly emphasizes the fireteam concept: according to US Army Field Manual 3-21.8 (Infantry Rifle Platoon and Squad, formerly FM 7-8) a typical United States Army fireteam consists of four soldiers. In the context of a Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT)&#x27;s Infantry Rifle Companies, one man from each fireteam in a rifle squad is either the Squad Anti-armor Specialist (RMAT), armed with the FGM-148 Javelin, or the Squad Designated Marksman (DM), who carries the M4 carbine and M14 rifle. In both cases this specialized function replaces the basic rifleman position in the fireteam.

===Canada===

As with other Commonwealth armies, the Marksman in the Canadian Army is a shooting achievement recognized by a badge bearing the monarch&#x27;s crown and crossed .303 Lee–Enfield No. 4, Mk I rifles. On operations within the Canadian Infantry Battalion, rifle company designated marksman can be assigned. This is not to be confused with Canadian sniper designation; these attain a high level of marksmanship and fieldcraft through grueling selected courses. Candidates must achieve &quot;recce&quot; qualification and marksman designation before being considered for the basic sniper course.

===India===
The Indian Army uses a locally manufactured licensed variant of the SVD Dragunov in the Designated Marksman role as part of each infantry platoon. The Dragunov is used in conjunction with the INSAS family of weapons to give flexibility and striking power at short to mid range firefights, to Indian Army infantry units engaged with opposing forces.

The Army Marksmanship Unit trains members for sports shooting as well as military shooting.

==Civilian marksman==

===United States===

The United States has a long tradition of marksmanship going back to its beginnings including the role of common men in its Revolutionary War. There are several organizations which promote civilian marksmanship including the Civilian Marksmanship Program which began just after the turn of the 20th century as a government chartered program and the Division of Civilian Marksmanship. One of the newest and currently the fastest growing marksmanship programs in North America is Project Appleseed which was started by the Revolutionary War Veterans Association in 2006. Shooters who score 210 out of 250 or better on the &quot;Quick and Dirty&quot; Appleseed AQT earn the Rifleman designation and are issued a Rifleman patch. Similar to the U.S. military marksmanship ratings of Unqualified, Marksman, Sharpshooter, and Expert (see Marksmanship Badge (United States)), the Appleseed ratings have the same levels, with the exception that instead of &quot;Expert&quot;, the equivalent performance level is called &quot;Rifleman&quot;.

The National Rifle Association of America was founded in 1871 to improve the marksmanship of American riflemen. Despite it being known contemporarily as a political advocacy organization for gun rights, the NRA continues to host marksmanship competitions and gun sports in the United States. A different organization, USA Shooting, organizes American shooting sports at the Olympic level.

==Longest recorded competition rifle shot==

The longest recorded shot in a shooting contest was 3.781 kilometres (2.35 miles), on March 27, 2021 in Barnard, Kansas by an American competitive shooter. The bullet flew for 9.4 seconds and hit the upper-left corner of a six-foot square (36 square feet) steel target. The rifle used was a GA Precision Custom, with a Nightforce ATACR 7-35×56 scope, on a bipod. Ammunition was Hornady .338-caliber 300-grain A-Tip.

<doc id="646268" wikidata="Q835714" url="?curid=646268" title="Oblasts of Russia">
<text>In Russia, the oblasts are 46 administrative territories; they are one type of federal subject, the highest-level administrative division of Russian territory.

==Overview==
Oblasts are constituent political entities in a federal union with representation in the Federation Council, and serve as a first-level administrative division. Each oblast features a state government holding authority over a defined geographic territory, with a state legislature, the &quot;Oblast Duma&quot;, that is democratically elected. The governor is the highest executive position of the state government in an oblast and is elected by the people. Oblasts are divided into &quot;raions&quot; (districts), cities of oblast significance (district-equivalent independent cities), and autonomous okrugs, which are legally federal subjects equal to an oblast but are administratively subservient to one. Two oblasts have autonomous okrugs: Arkhangelsk Oblast (Nenets Autonomous Okrug) and Tyumen Oblast (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug).

The term &quot;oblast&quot; can be translated into English as &quot;province&quot; or &quot;region&quot;, and there are currently 46 oblasts, the most common type of the 85 federal subjects in Russia. The majority of oblasts are named after their administrative center, the official term for a capital city in an oblast, which is generally the largest city. Exceptions to this include Leningrad Oblast and Moscow Oblast, which have no official capital, and Sakhalin Oblast, which is named after a geographic location. Leningrad Oblast and Sverdlovsk Oblast retain the previous names of Saint Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, respectively. Oblasts are typically areas that are predominantly populated by ethnic Russians and native Russian language speakers, and are mostly located in European Russia. The largest oblast by geographic size is Tyumen Oblast at 1,435,200 km2 (excluding autonomous okrugs Irkutsk Oblast is the largest at 767,900 km2) and the smallest is Kaliningrad Oblast at 15,100 km2. The most populous oblast is Moscow Oblast at 7,095,120 and the least populous is Magadan Oblast at 156,996.

Krais, another type of federal subject, are legally identical to oblasts. The difference between a political entity with the name &quot;oblast&quot; and one named &quot;krai&quot; is purely traditional.

==History==

In the Russian Empire, oblasts were a third-level administrative division, organized in 1849 and few in number, dividing the larger &quot;guberniyas&quot; (governorates) within the first-level krais. Following the numerous administration reforms during the Soviet era, the number of oblasts gradually increased as they became the primary top-level administrative division of the Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs), the constituent political entities of the Soviet Union. These oblasts held very little autonomy or power, but when the Soviet Union dissolved into sovereign states along the lines of the SSRs, they became the first-level administrative divisions. The oblasts of the Russian SFSR, which transitioned into the Russian Federation, became the first-level administrative divisions of the new country and received greater devolved power.
===Russo-Ukrainian War===
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia annexed the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine. While Donetsk and Luhansk were incorporated as republics, having their respective separate constitutions adopted since 2014 back when they were two breakaway states of Ukraine, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were annexed &quot;de jure&quot;, but not &quot;de facto&quot;, as regular oblasts. Including these, the Kremlin claims a total of 48 oblasts. The four regions remain internationally recognized as part of Ukraine and are only partially occupied by Russia and its control of the territory is not totally assured.

<doc id="646269" wikidata="Q4996207" url="?curid=646269" title="Bailiwick">
<text>A bailiwick () is usually the area of jurisdiction of a bailiff, and once also applied to territories in which a privately appointed bailiff exercised the sheriff&#x27;s functions under a royal or imperial writ.

In English, the original French combined with , the Anglo-Saxon suffix (meaning a village) to produce a term meaning literally &#x27;bailiff&#x27;s village&#x27;—the original geographic scope of a bailiwick. In the 19th century, it was absorbed into American English as a metaphor for a sphere of knowledge or activity.

The term can also be used colloquially to mean &#x27;one&#x27;s area of expertise.&#x27;

The term survives in administrative usage in the British Crown Dependencies of the Channel Islands, which are grouped for administrative purposes into two bailiwicksthe Bailiwick of Jersey (comprising the island of Jersey and uninhabited islets such as the Minquiers and Écréhous) and the Bailiwick of Guernsey (comprising the islands of Guernsey, Sark, Alderney, Brecqhou, Herm, Jethou and Lihou). A Bailiff heads each Channel Island bailiwick.

A bailiwick () was also the territorial division of the Teutonic Order. Here, various &quot;Komtur(en)&quot; formed a province.

==Origin==
The term originated in France (&quot;bailie&quot; being the Old French term for a bailiff). Under the ancien régime in France, the &#x27; was the king&#x27;s representative in a &#x27;, charged with the application of justice and control of the administration. In southern France, the term generally used was &#x27; (cf seneschal) who held office in the &#x27;. The administrative network of was established in the 13th century, based on the earlier medieval fiscal and tax divisions (the &#x27;baillie&#x27;) which had been used by earlier sovereign princes. (For more on this French judicial system, see &quot;bailli&quot;, &quot;prévôt&quot; and Early Modern France.)

==Bailiwick of Bicester Market End==
At Bicester in Oxfordshire, the Lord of the Manor of Market End was the Earl of Derby who, in 1597, sold a 9,999-year lease to 31 principal tenants. This in effect gave the manorial rights to the leaseholders, ‘purchased for the benefit of those inhabitants or others who might hereafter obtain parts of the demesne’. The leaseholders elected a bailiff to receive the profits from the bailiwick, mainly from the administration of the market and distribute them to the shareholders. From the bailiff&#x27;s title, the arrangement became known as the Bailiwick of Bicester Market End. By 1752 all of the original leases were in the hands of ten men, who leased the bailiwick control of the market to two local tradesmen.

<text>Boys Nation is an annual forum concerning civic training, government, leadership, and Americanism that is run by the American Legion. One hundred Boys Nation Senators are chosen from a pool of over 20,000 Boys State participants, making it one of the most selective educational programs in the United States.

Each year, two delegates in the summer after their junior year of high school are selected from each of the fifty American Legion Boys State programs in the United States (Hawaii does not host a Boys State however Washington DC does). These delegates attend a week-long event in Washington, DC funded by scholarships.

The event endeavors to teach delegates about the processes of the Federal government of the United States by establishing a mock Senate and organizing mock elections of a Boys Nation Senate President Pro Tempore, Senate Secretary, Vice President, and President. Senators also attend lectures and forums, and visit governmental institutions and historical sites. Tom Brokaw and former president Bill Clinton were previous Boys Nation senators. It is a tradition for the student senators to take a private tour of the White House and be received by the current president. Boys Nation senators also ordinarily receive private tours of the United States Supreme Court, the Congress, the Pentagon, and the State Department, several senators have also met with the incumbent president, including Donald Trump in 2017.

Students assume the role of a United States Senator, representing their respective (Boys) State. They write and introduce bills and debate in the senate chambers. Delegates are split into political parties and draft a party platform as well as perform usual party duties like nominations for president and vice-president, along with elected party leadership. For 2024&#x27;s session, Morgan Johnson was elected president.

The American Legion Auxiliary runs a similar event called Girls Nation.

<text>Hans Dragendorff (15 October 1870 in Dorpat (Tartu), Estonia – 29 January 1941 in Freiburg, Germany) was a Baltic German scholar who introduced the first classification system for the type of Ancient Roman pottery known as Samian ware or Terra sigillata, in 1896, using type numbers. His scheme was based on the varying forms the vessels took and although it has since been augmented and refined by others, it is still common to refer to &#x27;Dragendorff type 37&#x27; bowls, for example.

Dragendorff studied in Dorpat, Berlin and Bonn with Georg Loeschcke and received his doctorate in 1894 for his work on Terra sigillata. He held an extraordinary chair in Basel till 1902, when he became director of the newly founded &quot;Römisch-Germanische Kommission&quot; (RGK) of the &#x27;Deutsches Archäologisches Institut&#x27; (DAI), a post which he held until 1911. From 1911 to 1922 he was secretary general of the DAI. In 1922, he took a chair in Freiburg, a post he held until 1933.

Dragendorff was a member of the DAI (1901, corresponding member since 1898), member of the directorial board of the DAI from 1931 to 1941, member of the RGK 1902–1941, member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1916) and Honorary Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (1933).

<text>Ingram Douglass Marshall (May 10, 1942May 31, 2022) was an American composer and a onetime student of Vladimir Ussachevsky and Morton Subotnick.

==Early life and education==
Marshall was born in Mount Vernon, New York. He was the son of Bernice Douglass and Harry Reinhard Marshall, Sr. Marshall&#x27;s early interest in music was the result of encouragement provided by his mother, herself an accomplished pianist and vocalist. As a youth, he performed as a soprano in the Boy&#x27;s Choir at the Mt. Vernon Community Church, and during his high school years was influenced early by noted music instructor Victor Laslo. After graduating from the Fox Lane High School in 1960, he pursued musical studies at Lake Forest College and Columbia University, becoming affiliated with the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. In 1970 he became a graduate assistant to Morton Subotnick at Cal Arts, staying on to teach for several years after receiving his MFA in 1971.

==Career==
Though the composer used the term &quot;expressivist&quot; to describe his music, Marshall&#x27;s music is often associated with post-minimalism. His music often reflects an interest in world music, particularly Balinese gamelan tradition, as well as influence from the American minimalism trends of the 1960s (the composer often acknowledged the work of Steve Reich, Terry Riley, and John Adams).

He first gained recognition for his electroacoustic pieces, often performed by the composer himself on synthesizer, tape looping, gambuh (a traditional Balinese flute), and voice (&quot;Fragility Cycles&quot; [1978] is one of his best known works using this method of solo performance). His acoustic music frequently incorporated tape delay, and later, digital delay (such as &quot;Soe Pa&quot;, for solo classical guitar, and &quot;Hymnodic Delays&quot; for the Theatre of Voices). Many of the tape parts of his pieces include the composer&#x27;s own keening falsetto and gambuh playing (such as &quot;Fog Tropes&quot; and &quot;Gradual Requiem&quot; (1980)). Some of his works were produced in coordination with the assistance of noted Norwegian photographer, James Bengston of Studio Nord in Oslo.

Marshall wrote for the Kronos Quartet: &quot;Voces Resonae&quot; (1984) and &quot;Fog Tropes II&quot; (1982), featured in the 2010 film &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, and for the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra: &quot;Orphic Memories&quot; (2006).

He taught at the California Institute of the Arts in the early 1970s, joined the music faculty at The Evergreen State College in the late 1980s, and later moved to New Haven, Connecticut. He taught at the Yale School of Music and the Hartt School, and also held visiting teaching positions at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and Brooklyn College. Among his notable students are Timo Andres, Armando Bayolo, Christopher Cerrone, Tyondai Braxton, Jacob Cooper, Adrian Knight, Matt Sargent, and Stephen Gorbos.

Marshall was the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and studied gamelan music in Bali. In 1990 he was awarded a doctorate of philosophy in music by Lake Forest College, largely in recognition of his Fulbright award and gamelan studies in Bali. In addition to his Fulbright award, he received awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, Rockefeller Foundation, Fromm Foundation, Guggenheim Foundation, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

<text>Outer Manchuria, sometimes called Russian Manchuria, refers to a region in Northeast Asia that is now part of the Russian Far East but historically formed part of Manchuria (until the mid-19th century). While Manchuria now more normatively refers to Northeast China, it originally included areas consisting of Priamurye between the left bank of Amur River and the Stanovoy Range to the north, and Primorskaya which covered the area in the right bank of both Ussuri River and the lower Amur River to the Pacific Coast. The region was ruled by a series of Chinese dynasties and the Mongol Empire, but control of the area was ceded to the Russian Empire by Qing China during the Amur Annexation in the 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 Treaty of Peking, with the terms &quot;Outer Manchuria&quot; and &quot;Russian Manchuria&quot; arising after the Russian annexation. 

Prior to its annexation by Russia, Outer Manchuria was predominantly inhabited by various Tungsusic peoples who were categorized by the Han Chinese as &quot;Wild Jurchens&quot;. The Evenks, who speak a closely related Tungusic language to Manchu, make up a significant part of the indigenous population today. When the region was a part of the Qing dynasty, a small population of Han Chinese men migrated to Outer Manchuria and married the local Tungusic women. Their mixed descendants would emerge as a distinct ethnic group known as the Taz people.

==Etymology==

&quot;Manchuria&quot; was coined in the 19th century to refer to the northeastern part of the Qing Empire, the traditional homeland of the Manchu people. After the Amur Annexation by the Russian Empire, the ceded areas were known as &quot;Outer Manchuria&quot; or &quot;Russian Manchuria&quot;. (; or ).

== History ==
Outer Manchuria comprises the modern-day Russian areas of Primorsky Krai, southern Khabarovsk Krai, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, the Amur Oblast and the island of Sakhalin.

The northern part of the area was disputed by Qing China and the Russian Empire, in the midst of the Russia&#x27;s Far East expansion, between 1643 and 1689. The Treaty of Nerchinsk signed in 1689 after a series of conflicts, defined the Sino–Russian border as the Stanovoy Mountains and the Argun River. When the Qing sent officials to erect boundary markers, the markers were set up far to the south of the agreed limits, ignoring some 23,000 square miles of territory.

In 1809, the Japanese government sent explorer Mamiya Rinzō to Sakhalin and the region of the Amur to determine the extent of Russian influence and penetration.

To preserve the Manchu character of Manchuria, the Qing dynasty discouraged Han Chinese settlement in Manchuria; nevertheless, there was significant Han Chinese migration into areas south of the Amur and west of the Ussuri. By the mid-19th century, there were very few subjects of the Qing Empire living in the areas north of the Amur and east of the Ussuri, and Qing authority in the area was seen as tenuous by the Russians. Despite warnings, Qing authorities remained indecisive about how to respond to the Russian presence. In 1856, the Russian military entered the area north of the Amur on a pretext of defending the area from France and the UK; Russian settlers founded new towns and cut down forests in the region, and the Russian government created a new maritime province, Primorskaya Oblast, including Sakhalin, the mouth of the Amur, and Kamchatka with its capital at Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. After losing the Opium Wars, Qing China was forced to sign a series of treaties that gave away territories and ports to various Western powers as well as to Russia and Japan; these were collectively known by the Chinese side as the Unequal Treaties. Starting with the Treaty of Aigun in 1858 and, in the wake of the Second Opium War, the Treaty of Peking in 1860, the Sino–Russian border was realigned in Russia&#x27;s favour along the Amur and Ussuri rivers. As a result, China lost the region that came to be known as Outer Manchuria or Russian Manchuria (an area of ) and access to the Sea of Japan. In the wake of these events, the Qing government changed course and encouraged Han Chinese migration to Manchuria (&quot;Chuang Guandong&quot;).

==Modern opinions==
=== In Russia ===
In 2016, the director of the Institute of History, Archaeology and Ethnography of the Peoples of the Far East in Vladivostok, said that the fact that Russia had built Vladivostok &quot;is a historical fact that cannot be rewritten&quot;, and that the notion that Vladivostok was ever a Chinese town is a &quot;myth&quot; based on a misreading of evidence that a few Chinese sometimes came to the area to fish and collect sea cucumbers. The main point of Viktor Larin was that the Russian Far East (outer Manchuria) is Russia&#x27;s. They developed the region and thus, will not give it back.&quot;

Sergey Radchenko, speaking for China&#x27;s government, stated, &quot;China fully recognizes Russia&#x27;s sovereignty over these territories&quot; (referring to the Russian Far East). He also called Taiwan&#x27;s President Lai &quot;seriously misguided&quot; for attempting to suggest to China to take back her &quot;lost territories&quot;, rather than invade Taiwan. On September 3, 2024 Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said that &quot;the mutual renunciation of territorial claims by Moscow and Beijing had been enshrined in the July 16, 2001, Treaty of Good Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation, with Moscow and Beijing putting border issues to bed once and for all by signing the Additional Agreement on the Eastern part of the Russia-China Border on October 14, 2004, and ratifying the document later. This position was confirmed in a number of other joint documents that China and Russia adopted at various levels, including at the highest one.&quot;

=== In the West ===
Despite the potential for territorial claims coextensive with the Qing dynasty, Chinese leaders as of 2014 had not suggested that Mongolia and part of Outer or Russian Manchuria would be a legitimate objective. In April 2023, US diplomat John Bolton speculated that China is &quot;undoubtedly eyeing this vast territory, which potentially contains incalculable mineral wealth&quot;, referring to Asian Russia generally, further noting that &quot;[s]ignificant portions of this region were under Chinese sovereignty until the 1860 Treaty of Peking&quot;. However, two American historians, Jon K. Chang and Bruce A. Elleman, disagree with Larin, Radchenko and other Russian historians. Chang and Elleman note that in 1919 and 1920, Lev M. Karakhan, the Soviet deputy minister (also called &quot;commissar&quot;) of foreign affairs, issued two legally binding &quot;declarations&quot; called the Karakhan Manifestos in which he promised to return to China all territories taken in Siberia and Manchuria during the Tsarist period and to return the Chinese Eastern Railway and other concessions. He signed his name on both documents as deputy minister of foreign affairs. To date, China has never renounced the offer of the two Karakhan Manifestos. During 1991 and 2004, there were border-treaties between Russia and China. The Karakhan Manifestos are not border treaties. They are unilateral, but legally binding offers of the return of territory to China. Here are three excerpts from the first Karakhan Manifesto (I) according to the translated, English version published by Allen S. Whiting:

The Karakhan Manifestos I and II are similar. Both promise to return &quot;the conquests made by the Tsarist Government which deprived China of Manchuria and other areas.&quot;

==Place names==
Today, there are reminders of the ancient Manchu domination in English-language toponyms: for example, the Sikhote-Alin, the great coastal range; the Khanka Lake; the Amur and Ussuri rivers; the Greater Khingan, Lesser Khingan and other small mountain ranges; and the Shantar Islands. 

In 1973, the Soviet Union renamed several locations in the region that bore names of Chinese origin. Names affected included Partizansk for Suchan; Dalnegorsk for Tetyukhe; Rudnaya Pristan for Teyukhe‐Pristan; Dalnerechensk for Iman; Sibirtsevo for Mankovka; Gurskoye for Khungari; Cherenshany for Sinan cha; Rudny for Lifudzin; and Uglekamensk for Severny Suchan.

On February 14, 2023, the Ministry of Natural Resources of the People&#x27;s Republic of China relabelled eight cities and areas inside Russia in the region with Chinese names. The eight names are Boli for Khabarovsk, Hailanpao for Blagoveshchensk, Haishenwai (Haishenwei) for Vladivostok, Kuye for Sakhalin, Miaojie for Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, Nibuchu for Nerchinsk, Outer Khingan (Outer Xing&#x27;an) for Stanovoy Range, and Shuangchengzi for Ussuriysk.

<text>Adam Alfred Rudolf Glauer also known as Rudolf [[Freiherr]] von Sebottendorff (or Sebottendorf; 9 November 1875 - 8 May 1945) was a German occultist, writer, intelligence agent and political activist. He was the founder of the Thule Society, a post-World War I German occultist organization where he played a key role, and that influenced many members of the Nazi Party. He was a Freemason, a Sufi of the Bektashi order - after his conversion to Islam - and a practitioner of meditation, astrology, numerology, and alchemy. He also used the alias Erwin Torre.

==Early life==

His birth name was Adam Alfred Rudolf Glauer and he was born in Hoyerswerda in the Prussian Province of Silesia (present-day Saxony), the son of a locomotive engineer. He appears to have worked as a technician in Egypt between 1897 and 1900, although according to his own account he spent less than a month there in 1900 after a short career as a merchant sailor. In July of that year he travelled to Turkey, where he settled in 1901 and worked as an engineer on a large estate there.

By 1905 he had returned to Dresden where he married Klara Voss, but the couple divorced in 1907. The &quot;Münchener Post&quot; (14 March 1923) reported that he was sentenced as a swindler and forger in 1909, which Goodrick-Clarke (1985: 251) insists is a misprint for 1908.

He became an Ottoman citizen in 1911 and was apparently adopted (under Turkish law) by the expatriate Baron Heinrich von Sebottendorff shortly thereafter. The adoption was later repeated in Germany and its legal validity has been questioned, but it was endorsed by the Sebottendorff family (Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 140–41) and on this basis he asserted his claim to the Sebottendorff name and to the title of Freiherr.

After fighting on the Ottoman-Turkish side in the First Balkan War, Glauer returned to Germany with a Turkish passport in 1913. He was exempted from military service during the First World War because of his Ottoman citizenship and because of a wound received during the First Balkan War.

==Occult and mystical influences==
Glauer was introduced to occultism and esoteric concerns when he was living in Bursa, Turkey. His wealthy host, Hussein Pasha, was a Sufi and interested in such matters; it was around this time that Glauer saw the Mevlevi Order and visited the Great Pyramid of Giza in July 1900. At Bursa, Glauer became acquainted with the Termudi family, who were Jews from Thessaloniki. The Termudi family were involved in banking and the silk trade. They were also Freemasons, belonging to a lodge affiliated to the Rite of Memphis-Misraim. This network of lodges was closely connected to the Committee of Union and Progress (which later joined the Young Turks). The patriarch of the Termudi family initiated Glauer into the lodge and when Termudi died, he bequeathed his library of occult, Kabbalistic, Rosicrucian and Sufi texts to Glauer.

One of the books that Glauer inherited from Termudi featured a note from Hussein Pasha, which piqued his interest in the Sufi Bektashi Order, in regards to their alchemical and numerological practices. Speculations say he might have converted to Islam with Sufi-orientation, although the evidence (from his own semi-autobiographical writings) is rather tenuous on this point. In his autobiographical novel, &quot;The Rosicrucian Talisman&quot; (), Sebottendorff distinguishes between Sufi-influenced Turkish Masonry and conventional Masonry.

By about 1912 he became convinced that he had discovered what he called &quot;the key to spiritual realization&quot;, described by a later historian as &quot;a set of numerological meditation exercises that bear little resemblance to either Sufism or Masonry&quot; (Sedgwick 2004: 66).

==Involvement with the Thule Society==
By 1916, Glauer had attracted only one follower. In that year, however, he came into contact with the Germanenorden, and was subsequently appointed the &quot;Ordensmeister&quot; (local group leader) for the Bavaria division of the schismatic Germanenorden Walvater of the Holy Grail. Settling in Munich, he established the Thule Society, which became increasingly political. On 5 January 1919 Anton Drexler, who had developed links between the Thule Society and various extreme right workers&#x27; organizations in Munich, together with the Thule Society&#x27;s Karl Harrer, established the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP), or German Workers&#x27; Party. This party was joined in September 1919 by Adolf Hitler, who transformed it into the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party or Nazi Party. With help of his spouse Käthe Bierbaumer Glauer acquired the newspaper &quot;Münchner Beobachter&quot; which was shortly after renamed to the Völkischer Beobachter. The newspaper was purchased by the Nazi Party in December 1920 on the initiative of Chase Bauduin and Dietrich Eckart, who became the first editors. In 1921, Hitler acquired all shares in the company, making him the sole owner of the publication. The paper was to become Hitler’s most important propaganda tool.

By then, however, Glauer had left the Thule Society and Bavaria, having been accused of negligence in allegedly allowing the names of several key Thule Society members to fall into the hands of the government of the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic, resulting in the execution of seven members after the attack on the Munich government in April 1919, an accusation that he never denied. Sebottendorf fled Germany for Switzerland and then Turkey.

==Later life==
After leaving Germany, Glauer published &quot;The Practice of Ancient Turkish Freemasonry&quot; (), and then, in 1925, &quot;The Rosicrucian Talisman&quot; (), a semi-autobiographical novel which is the main source for his earlier life (see: &quot;Rosicrucians&quot;).

He returned to Germany in January 1933, and published &quot;Before Hitler Came: Documents from the Early Days of the National Socialist Movement&quot; (), dealing with the Thule Society and the DAP. Hitler himself understandably disliked this book, which was banned. Glauer was arrested, but somehow escaped (presumably due to some friendship from his Munich days) and in 1934 returned to Turkey.

His most polemic and obscure work, &quot;Bevor Hitler kam,&quot; was translated and published in English. The preface dates to November 1933.

Glauer was an agent of the German military intelligence in neutral Istanbul during the period 1942–1945, while apparently also working as a double agent for the British military. His German handler, Herbert Rittlinger, later described him as a &quot;useless&quot; agent (&quot;eine Null&quot;), but kept him on largely, it seems, because of an affection for &quot;this strange, by then penniless man, whose history he did not know, who pretended enthusiasm for the Nazi cause and admiration for the SS but who in reality seemed little interested in either, much preferring to talk about Tibetans&quot;.

Much remains unknown about his death, some accounts claim it was suicide by jumping into the Bosporus on 8 May 1945.

<text>Nomeansno (sometimes stylized as NoMeansNo or spelled No Means No) was a Canadian punk rock band formed in Victoria, British Columbia, and later relocated to Vancouver. They released 11 albums, including a collaborative album with Jello Biafra, and numerous EPs and singles. Critic Martin Popoff described their music as &quot;the mightiest merger between the hateful aggression of punk and the discipline of heavy metal.&quot; Nomeansno&#x27;s distinct hardcore punk sound, complex instrumentation, and dark, &quot;savagely intelligent&quot; lyrics inspired subsequent musicians. They were a formative influence on punk jazz, post-hardcore, math rock, and emo.

Formed in 1979 by brothers Rob and John Wright, they began as a two-piece punk band influenced by jazz and progressive rock. They self-released their debut &quot;Mama&quot; LP in 1982, added guitarist Andy Kerr the following year, and signed with Alternative Tentacles. Kerr departed in late 1991 after five LPs with the band, and the group returned to its two-piece formation for the &quot;Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy?&quot; album.

Guitarist Tom Holliston, and briefly second drummer Ken Kempster, joined in 1993. After three further LPs, they left Alternative Tentacles and issued their final album, &quot;All Roads Lead to Ausfahrt&quot;, in 2006. The Western Canadian Music Hall of Fame inducted them in 2015, and they retired the following year.

==History==
===Early years as two-piece and &quot;Mama&quot; (1979–1982)===
In 1979 and at age 25, Rob Wright returned to his family&#x27;s home in Victoria after studying in Calgary. John, Rob&#x27;s younger brother by eight years, played drums in the school jazz band, and the two were inspired to play punk rock after seeing D.O.A. perform at the University of Victoria. They began rehearsing in their parents&#x27; basement, and took the name Nomeansno from an anti-date rape slogan on a graffitied wall. They also briefly gigged as the rhythm section for local cover band Castle.

Nomeansno recorded its earliest material in the months that followed on a TASCAM four-track recorder, with Rob playing electric guitar and bass, John playing keyboards and drums, and both brothers singing. Some of these recordings were issued as their first two self-released 7&quot;s, the &quot;Look, Here Come the Wormies / SS Social Service&quot; single (a 1980 split with Mass Appeal, whose recording lineup featured both Wright Brothers), and the &quot;Betrayal, Fear, Anger, Hatred&quot; EP of 1981.

The brothers began performing live as a bass-and-drums duo in 1981. John later reflected on their sound&#x27;s development:

They self-released the &quot;Mama&quot; LP in a limited pressing in 1982. Writing for &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, critic Ira Robbins described &quot;Mama&quot; and the early 7&quot;s as &quot;Devo on a jazz trip, Motörhead after art school, or Wire on psychotic steroids.&quot; John also joined the Victoria punk band the Infamous Scientists.

===&quot;You Kill Me&quot; and &quot;Small Parts Isolated and Destroyed&quot; (1983–1989)===
The Infamous Scientists disbanded in 1983, and their guitarist and vocalist Andy Kerr joined Nomeansno several months later. Initially a guest and later full member, Kerr played with a buzz-saw guitar tone via a Fender Bassman amplifier and P.A. speaker. Nomeansno became a fixture in the British Columbia punk scene despite not conforming to the punk sound. The &quot;You Kill Me&quot; EP in 1985 on Undergrowth Records contained experimental songs like &quot;Body Bag&quot; and a cover of &quot;Manic Depression&quot; by Jimi Hendrix. The three also began performing Ramones covers and more traditional punk music as the Hanson Brothers, a side project that would later receive more attention.

Issued initially by Montreal&#x27;s Psyche Industry label, the band released &quot;Sex Mad&quot;, their second LP and first with Kerr. The album further expanded the band&#x27;s experimental and progressive punk sound, yielding the single &quot;Dad&quot;. The song was a minor college radio hit, which AllMusic reviewer Adam Bregman called &quot;a bit chilling, even though it&#x27;s spit out at slam-pit&#x27;s pace&quot;. Kerr, the song&#x27;s lead vocalist, increasingly became responsible for lead vocals as Rob Wright suffered from nodules on his vocal cords.

They signed with seminal punk label Alternative Tentacles, run by Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys. This, along with frequent touring in North America and Europe, helped the band gain a larger audience. In 1988, the group issued two releases recorded with producer Cecil English: &quot;The Day Everything Became Nothing&quot; EP and the &quot;Small Parts Isolated and Destroyed&quot; album. Alternative Tentacles compiled the two together on a single CD, &quot;The Day Everything Became Isolated and Destroyed&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Sean Carruthers called the experimental recordings &quot;less aggressive&quot; than, but nonetheless worthy of, the band&#x27;s previous efforts.

===&quot;Wrong&quot;, &quot;0 + 2 = 1&quot;, and &quot;Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy?&quot; (1989–1993)===

Rob Wright&#x27;s vocal cords began to heal, and he resumed acting as lead vocalist. In 1989, they issued their fourth album, &quot;Wrong&quot;, to wide critical acclaim. For AllMusic, Carruthers wrote that &quot;[t]he playing is incredibly skilled;&quot; critic Martin Popoff in writing for &quot;The Collector&#x27;s Guide to Heavy Metal&quot; called &quot;Wrong&quot; the band&#x27;s best album and rated the album 10 out of 10 points. The band&#x27;s extensive touring in support of the record is documented on the &quot;Live + Cuddly&quot; album, recorded in Holland in 1990. John later reported that circa 1990 the band became profitable enough that &quot;we didn&#x27;t have to have day jobs.&quot;

The band released a collaborative LP with Biafra, &quot;The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy&quot;, in 1991. Shortly thereafter, they issued &quot;0 + 2 = 1&quot;, their fifth album and final release with Kerr. In a mixed review, AllMusic critic Adam Bregman praised &quot;0 + 2 = 1&quot; for its finer moments, but was concerned about its length and ponderousness.

Kerr departed after touring in support of the record and emigrated to the Netherlands. He went on to release two LPs with Hissanol, a collaboration with Scott Henderson of Shovlhed. He subsequently released a solo album in 1997 before forming the duo Two Pin Din with Wilf Plum of Dog Faced Hermans in 2005.

The Wright brothers focused on their side project, the Hanson Brothers. Dressing as a group of Canadian ice hockey players and fans, they derived the band&#x27;s name and personae from characters in the 1977 George Roy Hill film &quot;Slap Shot&quot; starring Paul Newman. John acted as lead vocalist, and guitarist Tom Holliston of the Showbusiness Giants joined. With encouragement from Alternative Tentacles, the Hanson Brothers issued &quot;Gross Misconduct&quot; in 1992. Drummer Ken Jensen of D.O.A. completed the live lineup.

Rob began performing solo as Mr. Wrong, appearing as a character dressed as an authoritarian priest. John became a member of D.O.A. for several years. The brothers also continued to expand Wrong Records, their own imprint.

In 1993, the brothers assembled material for a sixth Nomeansno LP and recorded &quot;Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy?&quot; as a duo. AllMusic critic Ned Raggett later praised the album&#x27;s balance, arguing that it reached dark and sinister depths while also exhibiting subtler and more introspective moments. The Wrights also released the collection &quot;Mr. Right &amp; Mr. Wrong: One Down &amp; Two to Go&quot;, comprising early demos, studio outtakes, and additional material.

===&quot;Worldhood of the World (As Such)&quot; and &quot;Dance of the Headless Bourgeoisie&quot; (1993–1999)===
Holliston joined Nomeansno for touring in support of &quot;Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy?&quot;, and second drummer Ken Kempster joined later in 1993 to complete their first four-piece lineup. Kempster went on to tour sporadically with Nomeansno over the next four years.

Holliston and Kempster debuted on &quot;The Worldhood of the World (As Such)&quot;, released in 1995. With a title from philosopher Martin Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Being and Time&quot;, the album featured simpler and more melodic songs than its predecessors while nonetheless retaining the band&#x27;s &quot;taste for blood and gristle.&quot; After focusing briefly on the Hanson Brothers and releasing the LP &quot;Sudden Death&quot;, Nomeansno followed with the EPs &quot;Would We Be Alive?&quot; and &quot;In the Fishtank 1&quot;, each featuring a cover of &quot;Would We Be Alive?&quot; by the Residents.

They issued their eighth studio album, the double LP &quot;Dance of the Headless Bourgeoisie&quot;, in 1998. The album featured some of their longest songs and received mixed, but generally positive, reviews. In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Tom Schulte praised the album in its experimental tone as &quot;dark and unforgettable, poignant and cutting.&quot; A critic writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, however, dismissed the album as &quot;dull, meandering punk&quot; and likened the band pejoratively to Rush.

===&quot;One&quot; and &quot;All Roads Lead to Ausfahrt&quot; (2000–2006)===

The band issued its final Alternative Tentacles album, &quot;One&quot;, in 2000. Featuring a slow stoner rock cover of the Ramones&#x27;s &quot;Beat on the Brat&quot; and a fifteen-minute version of Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; with electric piano and congas, the album was well received. AllMusic&#x27;s Schulte assessed the album as &quot;intense and heavy collegiate punk&quot; as praised it as the band&#x27;s finest effort since &quot;Wrong&quot;. Three outtakes from the album were also issued as the &quot;Generic Shame&quot; EP on Wrong.

The band left Alternative Tentacles in 2002, mainly due to concerns about record distribution in Europe where their most devoted fan base lived. They began slowly reissuing their back catalogue through Wrong and distributors Southern Records. With new drummer Ernie Hawkins, the Hanson Brothers released their third album, &quot;My Game&quot;, later that year. Nomeansno continued touring extensively, but ultimately took six years to release their next album. In the meantime, they issued the best-of compilation &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

Their tenth studio album, &quot;All Roads Lead to Ausfahrt&quot;, was released on August 22, 2006, by AntAcidAudio in the United States and Southern in Europe. AllMusic critic Jo-Ann Greene praised the album&#x27;s exhausting diversity as befitting of the band&#x27;s legacy and career-spanning accomplishments. Greene wrote that with the record Nomeansno travel &quot;yet again through the undergrowth and underbelly of the rock realm, and with all the piss and vinegar that they started out with a quarter century ago.&quot;

===Later years and retirement (2007–2016)===
The band toured frequently in the years that followed, but ceased recording albums. Fang drummer Mike Branum joined the Hanson Brothers in 2008. In 2010, Nomeansno digitally released outtakes and demos from the &quot;0 + 2 = 1&quot; sessions as &quot;0 + 2 = 1 ½&quot;. They next released two four-track EPs, &quot;Tour EP 1&quot; (alternatively known as &quot;Old&quot;) and &quot;Tour EP 2&quot; (alternatively &quot;Jubilation&quot;). They continued performing live through 2013, and toured as the Hanson Brothers in the following year with Byron Slack on drums going on hiatus.

Holliston continued to perform with the Showbusiness Giants and release solo albums, while John Wright began working as musical director for the all-robot rock band Compressorhead. In 2015, Nomeansno was inducted into the Western Canadian Music Hall of Fame. They played an acoustic set at the awards ceremony, and a Ramones cover set (with Slack on drums) on New Year&#x27;s Eve, which became their final public appearances. Holliston announced his departure from the band in August 2016. On September 24, John Wright announced the band&#x27;s official retirement.

===Post-retirement===
&quot;Wrong&quot; was named the public vote winner of the Polaris Heritage Prize at the 2021 Polaris Music Prize. In December 2023, PM Press released the band&#x27;s authorized biography, &quot;NoMeansNo: From Obscurity to Oblivion: An Oral History&quot;, written by radio host Jason Lamb. The book features interviews with all five band members, as well as friends, family, fellow musicians, and fans. 

In 2023 John Wright&#x27;s solo project Dead Bob issued the album &quot;Life Like&quot; and toured in its support with a live band featuring Ford Pier and other musicians.

In 2024, Nomeansno returned to Alternative Tentacles for distribution of their recording, along with remastered editions of &quot;Wrong&quot; and the 1987 single &quot;Dad/Revenge&quot;.

<text>Ryman is a stationery retail company with 205 outlets nationwide in the United Kingdom. The website and stores provide a wide range of stationery and office supplies for homes and businesses, with its headquarters in Crewe, Cheshire.

==History==

===Formation===
Henry J Ryman opened his first store as a book printer on Great Portland Street, London in 1893, that is still open today. Quickly changing the focus to selling stationery, the business was successfully owned and managed by the Ryman family for several generations. Jack Ryman succeeded Henry in 1931, until he passed it on to his own sons, Desmond and Nicholas, in 1951. At the time that Desmond and Nicholas assumed control from father, the company comprised eleven shops. Expansion followed, along with the introduction of self-service counters and during their ownership, turnover rose from £250,000 to £16 million. Upon selling the company, Nicholas moved to France to become a vigneron.

From 1912 to 1995, the business traded as H. J. Ryman Limited.

In 1968, Ryman merged with the furniture retailer Habitat to form Ryman Conran. The following year they purchased the business of Lupton Morton, who mostly supplied furniture to offices and corporations but also made pieces by other designers, and in 1970, acquired the retail chain Straker-Bedser.

By 1970, the turnover of the group had doubled since the merger with Habitat. However, Terence Conran was disappointed that Habitat itself had not been expanded, and offered to purchase Habitat from Ryman Conran, along with Conran Associates and the remains of Lupton Morton.

Ryman Conran, who did not highly value the Habitat chain, and apparently thought it was making a loss, agreed to the sale. Ryman Conran retained Habitat&#x27;s original factory in Thetford along with Conran Design Group.

In 1972, the Ryman brothers sold Ryman Conran to the Burton Group for £8 million. Rodney Fitch bought out Conran Design Group, renaming it Fitch &amp; Company in the same year.

During the 1970s and 1980s the business passed through several different owners, including Jennifer d&#x27;Abo, who purchased the chain in 1981 and floated it on the Stock Exchange in 1986, and Pentos (owners of Athena and Dillons Booksellers among others), who took the company private again for £20 million (double the flotation price) in 1987.

After a share suspension, Ryman parent company Pentos collapsed into receivership in March 1995. Despite interest from former owner d&#x27;Abo and firm bids from a team of Ryman franchisees, backed by 3i, receivers KPMG struggled to generate interest in the company due to the
high rents being paid by the company&#x27;s high street premises.

===Theo Paphitis===
Theo Paphitis had been involved in the Ryman business since 1994, having had NAG Telecom concessions in larger Ryman stores. He developed a relationship with the then marketing director Malcolm Cooke, and this eventually led to Paphitis purchasing Ryman from the receivers in March 1995. The purchase was made through Chancerealm Ltd (which later changed its name to Ryman Group Limited).

In 1996, the Ryman Direct mail order catalogue was introduced, followed by a website in 1998. To build a national chain in the United Kingdom, in September 2001, the group acquired the stationery retailer Partners with 86 stores, and in February 2007, purchased 61 stores of Stationery Box.

The businesses and all stores were combined under a redesigned Ryman brand in October 2008, which presently comprises 210 stores with a turnover of more than £125m. In October 2016, the Theo Paphitis Retail Group purchased specialist stationery retailer London Graphics Centre, which was founded in 1973.

==Products==
Ryman was the first stationer to introduce the concept of colour to filing, with both cabinets and folders. Today, Ryman Stationery stock a wide range of inkjet cartridges, printers, pens, paper, envelopes, office essentials, filing, presentation materials, diaries and Back to School Supplies.

==Sponsorship==
Ryman were sponsors of the English football Isthmian League from 1997 to 2017, which was, as of 2017, the longest running sponsorship in the history of football in the United Kingdom.

They were also principal sponsors of the English Football Club, Millwall FC in the 2003-2004 season.

In addition, Ryman also sponsors cricket through the Surrey Championship.

==Charity==
Ryman is an official partner of Comic Relief, raising over £5million for the charity through the sale of exclusive Comic Relief pens in its shops and online, as well as other fundraising activities.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier (14 January 1705 – 1786) was a French explorer and colonial administrator of the Mascarene Islands to the east of Madagascar.

He was orphaned at the age of seven and after being educated in Paris, he was sent to Saint Malo to study navigation. He became a lieutenant of the French East India Company in 1731. He succeeded in convincing his employer to provide him with two ships and send him on an exploration mission in the South Atlantic. With his ships &quot;Aigle&quot; and &quot;Marie&quot; he discovered on 1 January 1739 a tiny island which was named Bouvet Island after him, the world’s remotest island; however, he mislabelled the coordinates for the island, causing it to be lost until it was rediscovered seven decades later in 1808. Shortly afterwards, he had to abandon the expedition because most of his crew had fallen ill; his ship then called at the Cape of Good Hope and returned to France.

Ten years after his expedition, Lozier was appointed governor of the Mascarene Islands twice, once from 1750 to 1752 and a second time from 1757 to 1763.

<text>Eliphalet Dyer (September 14, 1721 – May 13, 1807) was an American lawyer, jurist, and statesman from Windham, Connecticut. He was a delegate for Connecticut to many sessions of the Continental Congress, where he signed the 1774 Continental Association.

== Early life and education ==
Dyer was born in Windham and attended Yale where, he graduated in 1740. He read law and was admitted to the bar in 1746.

== Career ==
After completing his legal education, Dyer became a member of the militia. In 1747, he was elected justice of the peace and a member of the colonial assembly. He was also involved in several of the land development schemes for the Susquehanna and Wyoming Valley areas.

During the French and Indian War, Dyer served as a lieutenant colonel in the militia. He participated in the expedition that captured Crown Point from the French, as a Colonel of the Third Connecticut Provincial Regiment in 1755. In 1758, he led his regiment to Canada in support of Amherst’s and Wolfe’s operations.

In 1763, he visited London as an agent for the &quot;Susquehanna Land Company&quot; in a failed attempt to gain a title for a colonial venture to the Wyoming region. Connecticut sent Dyer to New York City for the Stamp Act Congress. This Congress of protest was an important precursor to the American Revolution. In 1766, he was elected a justice of Connecticut’s superior court. He held that post until 1793, serving as chief justice after 1789.

As the Revolution began, Dyer was named to the state’s Committee of Safety and named a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1774. He served in the Congress during 1774–1775, 1777–1779, and 1782–1783. John Adams, in his diary, characterized Dyer as &quot;...longwinded and roundabout, obscure and cloudy, very talkative and very tedious, yet an honest, worthy man; means and judges well.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Dyer retired from public life in 1793. He died at home in Windham on May 13, 1807, and is buried in the Windham Cemetery. His daughter Amelia was married to Joseph Trumbull, who officially served with Dyer in the Continental Congress but did not attend any sessions.

<doc id="646311" wikidata="Q1081108" url="?curid=646311" title="Christian Methodist Episcopal Church">
<text>The Christian Methodist Episcopal Church (C.M.E.C.) is a Methodist denomination that is based in the United States. It adheres to Wesleyan-Arminian theology. Though historically a part of the black church, the Christian Methodist Episcopal church membership has evolved to include all racial backgrounds. 
== History ==
The CME Church was organized on December 16, 1870, in Jackson, Tennessee, by 41 former enslaved congregants, with the full support of their white sponsors in their former Methodist Episcopal Church, South. They met to form an organization that would allow them to establish and maintain their own polity. They ordained their own bishops and ministers without their being officially endorsed or appointed by the white-dominated body. They called this fellowship the &quot;Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in America&quot;. The church used this name until 1954, when successors adopted the C.M.E.C. name.

==Organization==
In the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, bishops are the Chief Officers and are elected by &quot;delegate&quot; votes for life until the age of 74, when he/she must retire. Among their duties are the responsibilities of appointing clergy to serve in local churches as pastors, performing ordinations, and safeguarding the doctrines and discipline of the Church. The General Conference, held every four years, comprises an equal number of clergy and lay delegates and is when a bishop can be elected. In each Annual Conference, CME bishops serve for four-year terms. CME Church bishops may be male or female.

In 2006, there were an estimated 850,000 members in 3,500 churches. , the CME Church has grown to more than 1.5 million members across the United States with mission and sister churches in Haiti, Jamaica and fourteen African nations.

==Doctrine==

The foundational doctrines of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church are found in what is commonly referred to in Wesleyan Methodism as The Articles of Religion. The Articles of Religion were derived from the Church of England and abridged by John Wesley, Founder of Methodism, for Methodists in America in 1784.

==Hymnal and responsive readings==
Sunday worship services in the CME denomination commonly include a Responsive Reading from scripture. A leader reads a line of scripture and the congregation reads a response. Bible passages are not arranged by topic; responsive readings are. Often, a single responsive reading consists of excerpts from several Bible passages.

The CME Responsive Readings are published in &quot;The Hymnal of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church&quot;. Items 1–545 are songs, and items 546–604 are Responsive Readings. The official Responsive Readings are from the &quot;King James Version of the Bible&quot;.

==CME connectional emblem==

The official logo or symbol of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church was originally authorized by Bishop B. Julian Smith for the Centennial General Conference held in Memphis, 1970. It was officially adopted by the General Conference in 1974 as the denomination&#x27;s connectional marker.

Designed by Will E. Chambers, the logo shows the place of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in the rapidly changing urbanized society and its relation to God&#x27;s people. The logo is composed of:

:The World Globe which represents the vineyard of God;

:The Skyline which stands for the Church&#x27;s concern for human and urban problems and people&#x27;s alienation from God and one another;

:The Weather Vane which symbolizes the need of the Church to be flexible in terms of meeting the contemporary needs of people; and,

:The Cross which denotes, by its vertical bar, the need for a proper relationship between people and God, and by its horizontal bar, the need for proper relationships between people. The total Cross is a sign of the final-assured victory through the blood of Jesus Christ.

==Ecumenical activity==
Since the early 20th century the CME Church has explored the possibility of merging with other African American Methodist churches that are very similar in doctrine and practice.

In 1918 representatives of the CME Church, the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion (AME Zion) Church met in Birmingham, Alabama where they agreed to propose a merger. This &quot;Birmingham Plan&quot; was approved by the CME General Conference but did not win enough support in the annual conferences.

in the late 20th century, the CME Church engaged in new talks with the AME Zion Church on a merger, with CME General Conference delegates approving a union in principle in 1986, and AME Zion delegates giving the same approval in 1988. Bishops of each church reopened the question in 1999, adopting a timeline for an eventual merger.

In May 2012, The Christian Methodist Episcopal Church entered into full communion with the United Methodist Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, African Union Methodist Protestant Church, African Methodist Episcopal Church, and Union American Methodist Episcopal Church. These Churches agreed to &quot;recognize each other&#x27;s churches, share sacraments, and affirm their clergy and ministries.&quot;

<text>The Battle of [[Mount Athos|Athos]] (also known as the Battle of Monte Sancto or the Battle of [[Lemnos]]) took place on 1–2 July 1807New Style as a part of the Napoleonic Wars during the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812.

== Background == 
In December 1806, Ottoman Sultan Selim III felt threatened by Russian activities associated with the Napoleonic War. The Sultan closed the Turkish Straits to Russian shipping and declared war on the Russian Empire. On 22 May 1807, the Russian navy and the Ottoman navy engaged in a short sea battle in the Aegean Sea near the Dardanelles. 

After the Battle of the Dardanelles in May, the Russian navy continued to blockade the strait during the month of June. Although the blockade served an important military purpose in and of itself by impeding the flow of food and materials to Constantinople, the Russian navy in the Aegean Sea sought primarily to draw the Ottoman navy out of the strait for a decisive engagement on the open sea. Although the Ottoman navy had numerical superiority, the Turks attempted to avoid a direct confrontation with the Russian fleet. As a result, the Ottoman navy sheltered in the strait and ventured out to attack the Russian naval base on Tenedos only when conditions were favorable. 

== Maneuvers before the battle ==
To lure the Ottoman navy into the Aegean Sea, the Russian Vice-Admiral, Dmitry Senyavin, undertook numerous maneuvers with his fleet often reducing the number of ships that he had positioned in the vicinity of the entrance to the Dardanelles. On 5 June, Senyavin sent Rear-Admiral Greig in command of four battleships to the island of Lemnos, approximately 41 miles west of the Dardanelles. Greig and his squadron was then brought back quickly when Senyavin falsely suspected that the Ottoman navy was entering the Aegean Sea. On 13 June, Greig was sent back to Lemnos this time with his full force of five battleships. Russian marines were temporarily landed on Lemnos, but by 18 June Greig and his squadron had returned to Tenedos.

Finally on 22 June, Seyid Ali, the Kapudan Pasha or Grand Admiral of the Ottoman navy, left the Dardanelles with a taskforce of 16 ships including 8 battleships and 5 frigates. After tacking into the wind all day Seyid Ali anchored his fleet near Imbros, approximately 12 miles North-Northwest of the Dardanelles. Over the course of the following days, Senyavin and his Russian fleet attempted to work their way up to the Turks but were prevented in doing so by light winds and a strong adverse current. The Ottoman fleet also kept underway during this time always keeping an escape route back to the Dardanelles open. On 24 June, Seyid Ali’s task force was joined by four additional ships, 2 battleships and 2 frigates. 

On 27 June, Senyavin decided to try to approach the Ottoman fleet by sailing to the west side Lemnos where there was less current. When Senyavin made that move, Seyid Ali and his entire taskforce bore down on Tenedos, bombarding the fortifications and a brig in the harbor. A failed attempt was also made to put a land force on the north side of island. After four hours of bombardment, the Ottoman fleet disengaged and drew off to a position between Tenedos and the Asiatic shore. Over the course of the next two days the Ottoman fleet returned to Tenedos two times to bombard the fortifications and land their marines. At 8 am on 29 June, Seyid Ali’s taskforce sighted Senyavin and the Russian fleet approaching from the north. The Turks ceased their bombardment of Tenedos and took their only course of escape fleeing west toward Lemnos.

Upon reaching Tenedos, Senyavin used the next two days to reprovision his fleet and to hunt down and destroy Turkish small craft remaining in the vicinity. Aware that the Ottoman task force had taken a western course when it sailed from Tenedos, Senyavin and the Russian fleet of 10 battleships departed their naval base on 30 June in a northerly direction continuing to block the access to the Dardanelles. At the end of the day, the Russian fleet had reached a point six miles north of Lemnos. Early the next morning, Senyavin sighted Seyid Ali’s taskforce to the west of Lemnos and immediately moved to attack. 

== Battle ==
When Senyavin caught up with the Ottoman taskforce between 8 am and 9 am on the morning of 1 July, the Turks had their battleships aligned in a straight row heading north. Senyavin arranged his battleships in two parallel rows of five ships each and approached the Turks in a perpendicular manner from the east, striking the Turkish flagships in the middle of the column. The Ottoman immediately opened fire and badly damaged a lead Russian ship, the &quot;Rafail&quot;. The remaining Russian battleships paired up and turned to the north to engage the Turks in a broadside manner. Senyavin sailed to the head of the column with two battleships and quickly put a leading Turkish frigate out of action. This caused the battleship following the frigate and the entire Turkish column to heave to and slow. The two fleets then engaged in battle until 10 am when the Turks began to break away with the Russians in pursuit. 

At noon the winds died down and Senyavin broke off the engagement. The Ottoman taskforce began to gather east of the Mount Athos peninsula while the Russians maintained their position to the east of the Turkish fleet. Later that evening, a light breeze came up and the Ottoman taskforce continued on a northerly course toward the island of Thasos. During that time, the Turkish frigate &quot;Sadd al-bahr&quot; fell behind and was captured by the Russians without additional fighting. 

On the morning of 2 July, most of the Ottoman taskforce was near Thasos. Two Ottoman battleships and a sloop were seen straggling behind the fleet and were quickly set upon by the Russians. The Russians drove the three ships up the gulf west of Mount Athos and forced the Turks to run the ships aground and set them on fire. Two days later on 4 July, the Turks were seen setting two badly damaged ships on fire near Thasos. 

During this time, the Russian fleet concentrated near Lemnos and then made its way back to their beleaguered naval base on Tenedos where they helped defeat the Turkish marines who had been attempting to capture the base without success for nine days. The Ottoman fleet meanwhile made its way back to the safety of the Dardanelles losing two additional ships near Samothrace in the process. 

== Aftermath ==
Of the 20 Turkish ships involved in the battle, only 12 returned to the Dardanelles. Lost were 3 battleships, 3 frigates, and 2 sloops. The total number of casualties is not known but was estimated to be heavy. The Russians did not lose a single ship but suffered casualties of 79 killed and 189 wounded.

There were no further naval battles between the Russians and the Turks with respect to the Dardanelles during the Russo-Turkish War of 1806-1812 as the Treaties of Tilsit signed on 7 July between Napoleon and Tsar Alexander of Russia provided that Senyavin’s fleet be sent back to the Baltic Sea. At that time, the British also began to negotiate a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire and supported their position by a show of force, bringing their own navy into the Aegean Sea.

<doc id="646326" wikidata="Q333918" url="?curid=646326" title="Kunihiko Kodaira">
<text>was a Japanese mathematician known for distinguished work in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds, and as the founder of the Japanese school of algebraic geometers. He was awarded a Fields Medal in 1954, being the first Japanese national to receive this honour.

== Early life and education ==
Kodaira was born in Tokyo. He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1938 with a degree in mathematics and also graduated from the physics department at the University of Tokyo in 1941. During the war years he worked in isolation, but was able to master Hodge theory as it then stood. He obtained his PhD from the University of Tokyo in 1949, with a thesis entitled &quot;Harmonic fields in Riemannian manifolds&quot;. He was involved in cryptographic work from about 1944, while holding an academic post in Tokyo.

== Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University ==
In 1949 he travelled to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey at the invitation of Hermann Weyl. He was subsequently also appointed Associate Professor at Princeton University in 1952 and promoted to Professor in 1955. At this time the foundations of Hodge theory were being brought in line with contemporary technique in operator theory. Kodaira rapidly became involved in exploiting the tools it opened up in algebraic geometry, adding sheaf theory as it became available. This work was particularly influential, for example on Friedrich Hirzebruch.

In a second research phase, Kodaira wrote a long series of papers in collaboration with Donald C. Spencer, founding the deformation theory of complex structures on manifolds. This gave the possibility of constructions of moduli spaces, since in general such structures depend continuously on parameters. It also identified the sheaf cohomology groups, for the sheaf associated with the holomorphic tangent bundle, that carried the basic data about the dimension of the moduli space, and obstructions to deformations. This theory is still foundational, and also had an influence on the (technically very different) scheme theory of Grothendieck. Spencer then continued this work, applying the techniques to structures other than complex ones, such as G-structures.

In a third major part of his work, Kodaira worked again from around 1960 through the classification of algebraic surfaces from the point of view of birational geometry of complex manifolds. This resulted in a typology of seven kinds of two-dimensional compact complex manifolds, recovering the five algebraic types known classically; the other two being non-algebraic. He provided also detailed studies of elliptic fibrations of surfaces over a curve, or in other language elliptic curves over algebraic function fields, a theory whose arithmetic analogue proved important soon afterwards. This work also included a characterisation of K3 surfaces as deformations of quartic surfaces in &quot;P&quot;3, and the theorem that they form a single diffeomorphism class. Again, this work has proved foundational. (The K3 surfaces were named after Ernst Kummer, Erich Kähler, and Kodaira).

==Later years==
Kodaira left Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study in 1961, and briefly served as chair at the Johns Hopkins University and Stanford University. In 1967, he returned to the University of Tokyo. He was awarded a Wolf Prize in 1984/5. He died in Kofu on 26 July 1997.

He was honoured with the membership of the Japan Academy, the Mathematical Society of Japan and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. He was the foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1975, member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences in 1974 and honorary member of the London Mathematical Society in 1979. He received the Order of Culture and the Japan Academy Prize in 1957 and the Fujiwara Prize in 1975.
