<text>Rear-Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham, KCB, KCH (12 October 1762 – 20 September 1820), was a Royal Navy officer and politician who served in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He is known for his scientific accomplishments, particularly the development of a signal code that was adopted by the Royal Navy in 1803.

==Early life ==
===Childhood===
Home Popham was born in Gibraltar on 12 October 1762, the fifteenth child of Joseph Popham, British consul at Tétouan in Morocco, and his first wife Mary, née Riggs. It is likely that the child&#x27;s first name was chosen to honour Gibraltar&#x27;s former Governor William Home. Mary Popham died an hour after Home was born, from complications associated with the birth. Nine months later Joseph married Catherine Lamb, who became responsible for raising Home and his siblings. The couple also had six more children.

In 1769 Joseph Popham was forced to resign as consul after a personal dispute with the Moroccan Emperor regarding piracy against English merchantmen. The British Government subsequently blamed Joseph Popham for the disagreement, with Gibraltar Governor Edward Cornwallis describing him as an &quot;honest well meaning man&quot; who had met with &quot;little success&quot; and was henceforth &quot;an improper person to serve His Majesty [as consul].&quot; The Popham family returned to England, settling first in Chichester and then Guernsey. Joseph sought further diplomatic postings but was successful only in securing an annual government pension of £200 which was insufficient to cover debts incurred during his Moroccan consulship. The family was forced to rely on income earned by Home&#x27;s brothers, particularly Stephen Popham who was then a successful barrister. In 1772 Home was sent to Westminster School in London, where he remained for three years. His father Joseph died in Guernsey in 1774.

On 3 January 1776 Home was admitted to further study at Trinity College, Cambridge. His education may have been paid for by his brother Stephen or by Captain Edward Thompson, a family friend. There is no record of Home actually residing in Cambridge or attending lectures. In April 1778 he abandoned his studies and enlisted in the Royal Navy as an able seaman aboard Thompson&#x27;s newly built frigate .

===Early voyages===
Popham served with the flag of Admiral George Rodney till the end of the American War of Independence. In 1781 he was aboard when the French under the Comte de Grasse captured her near Saint Lucia. Popham was exchanged and returned to service.

In 1783 he was promoted to lieutenant, and was for a time engaged on survey service on the coast of Africa.

Between 1787 and 1793 he was engaged in a series of commercial ventures in the Eastern Sea, sailing, first for the Imperial Ostend Company, and then in , a vessel that he purchased and in part loaded himself.

During this time he took several surveys and rendered some services to the British East India Company, which were officially acknowledged. In 1793, however, his ship was seized, partly on the grounds that he was carrying contraband, and partly because he was infringing the East India Company&#x27;s monopoly. The value of his loss was put at £70,000, and he was entangled in litigation. In 1805 he obtained compensation to the amount of £25,000. The case was a hard one, for he was undoubtedly sailing with the knowledge of officials in India.

==Service in the wars with France==
While this dispute was going on Popham had resumed his career as a naval officer. He served with the army under the Duke of York in Flanders as &quot;superintendent of Inland Navigation&quot; and won his confidence. The protection of the duke was exercised with so much effect that Popham was promoted commander in 1794 and post captain in 1795. He was then engaged for several years in co-operating in a naval capacity with the troops of Great Britain and her allies.

His bills for the repair of his ship at Calcutta were the excuse for an attack on him and for charging him with the amount. It was just the time of the general reform of the dockyards, and there was much suspicion in the air. It was also the case that Lord St. Vincent did not like Popham, and that Benjamin Tucker (1762–1829), secretary to the admiralty, who had been the admiral&#x27;s secretary, was his creature and sycophant. However, Popham was not the man to be snuffed out without an effort. He brought his case before Parliament, and was able to prove that there had been, if not deliberate dishonesty, at least the very grossest carelessness on the part of his assailants.

In the spring of 1798 the Admiralty created the Sea Fencibles, a force of coastal militia, following a plan by Popham. On 8 May 1798 Home Popham led an expedition to Ostend to destroy the sluice gates of the Bruge canal. The expedition landed a contingent of 1,300 British Army soldiers under the command of Major General Coote. The troops burnt some ships in the harbour before blowing up locks and gates on the canal. His force then surrounded had to surrender as adverse winds prevented their re-embarkation. It was during this period perhaps in captivity, before being returned home that Popham began work on a standard signal instructions handbook for the Royal Navy. Ship to ship communication was very haphazard: a fleet system that protected vulnerable frigates on station was essential to save time and material. The global character of the navy required linking to larger fleet formations. During service on in the Battle of Copenhagen Popham tested his telegraphic equipment. He acted as liaison officer to the Danish Court off station from Elsinore. Popham was under the direction of Admiral Archibald Dickson when he devised the two or three flag hoist, in which each sign was a number, and each combination a different state of readiness. The vocabulary was limited and totally nautical, apposite to a direct command. At Copenhagen boats could be sent ashore, but were unnecessary using only flag signals. Popham was deeply encouraged by Lord Spencer, 1st Lord of the Admiralty who advised publication of the signal books. The new signals were immensely useful to Nelson at Trafalgar in developing navy tactics in secret. Popham proved McArthur, his critic and rival, wrong; Popham&#x27;s books were printed several times after the battle.

=== Red Sea expedition ===
In early 1801 Popham brought out to the Cape of Good Hope several regiments. He then embarked the 22nd and 61st Regiments of Foot and the garrison on his transports and was expected on 28 February to leave on a secret expedition. At the time the speculation was that he would sail to attack the Spanish colonies in the Río de la Plata.

Instead, Popham sailed to the Red Sea to support General Baird&#x27;s expedition to Egypt to help General Ralph Abercromby expel the French there. On 23 May 1801, he drew 6,000 Spanish dollars for His Majesty&#x27;s ships on the expedition from the treasury on &quot;Cuvera&quot; while she was in the Judda roads.

On 14 June 1802 the transport &quot;Calcutta&quot; wrecked on the Egyptian coast in the Red Sea. She was carrying 331 men of the 80th Regiment of Foot and 79 native Indian followers. arrived the next day, as did two transports. Only &quot;Romney&quot; was able to get her boats out but they were able to rescue and deliver to the shore all but seven men who had died in an early attempt to reach shore. Popham, in &quot;Romney&quot;, left to salvage anything that could be salvaged and then sailed to Suez from whence he dispatched to pick up the troops on the 15th and carry them back to India.

===Río de la Plata expedition===
Commissioned by prime minister Pitt in 1805 to study the military plans being proposed by Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda to the British Government, Popham then persuaded the authorities that, as the Spanish Colonies were discontented, it would be easy to promote a rising in Buenos Aires. After co-operating with Sir David Baird in recovering the Cape of Good Hope Station from the Dutch in January 1806, he led the British invasions of the Río de la Plata on Buenos Aires by General Beresford&#x27;s brigade of 1500 men with his squadron. Over 100 men died from sickness leaving 1400 weakened soldiers when they arrived; but the Spanish colonists, though discontented, were not disposed to accept British rule. They rose up against the soldiers who had landed, and took them prisoners. Popham&#x27;s ships bombarded the taken citadel, but he was recalled, and censured by a court martial for leaving his station. In spite of his embarrassment the City of London presented him with a sword of honour for his endeavours to &quot;open new markets&quot;, and the sentence did him limited harm.

=== From Spain to North America Station ===
In 1806 Popham was appointed a groom of the bedchamber to the Duke of Gloucester. With a collaborator, John Goodhew, he published &quot;A General Code of Signals for the use of His Majesty&#x27;s Navy&quot;, in which there were only twelve flags doubled backed to make twenty-four flags were used and no numbers. Variation was provided by a pendant, and changes were made to the key to maintain secrecy. But Popham&#x27;s original system offered the Admiralty a huge variety of signals to be sent interpolated by tables with places marked around the world. Popham&#x27;s was both complex and sophisticated for the time, but limited by a bifurcated alphabet.

In 1807 Lord Gambier appointed him captain of the fleet for the Second Copenhagen Expedition. In 1809 he went on to command HMS &quot;Venerable&quot;, which he continued to command with success against the French in Spain. Popham&#x27;s instructions were in general use by 1812 throughout the Royal Navy. But there were doubters, such as a major sceptic Admiral Sir George Berkeley who refused to use the signals and could not see their point. In 1812 and 1813 he was stationed on the northern coast of Spain where he worked with the Spanish guerrillas to successfully harry the French troops and assault French fortresses on the Basque coast while Wellington was advancing through Spain. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1814, appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1815. This was capped off with a personal gift from Prince Regent in the Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1818. He served as Commander-in-Chief, Jamaica Station from 1817 to 1820.

==Parliament==
Popham was Member of Parliament (MP) for Yarmouth from 1804 to 1806, for Shaftesbury from 1806 to 1807, and for Ipswich from 1807 to 1812.

==Death and legacy==
He died in Cheltenham on September 20, 1820 aged 57, leaving a large family.
He was buried on September 25 in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels at Sunninghill, Berkshire, close to his home, Titness Park. His wife died in Bath in 1866 at age 94.

Popham was one of the most scientific seamen of his time. He did much useful survey work, and was the author of the code using signal flags adopted by the admiralty in 1803 and used for many years. These were most famously used for the signal &quot;England expects that every man will do his duty&quot;. Considerable opposition to the Admiralty adopting the code was presented by Admirals Hood and St Vincent. It took First Lord Sir John Laughton only 29 words to dismiss that code adopted by Admiral Nelson. It was not until 1816 that prejudice against Popham&#x27;s previous court-martial was put aside and the system&#x27;s brilliance fully recognized.

<text>Jones Soda Co. is a beverage company based in Seattle, Washington, United States. It bottles and distributes soft drinks, non-carbonated beverages, energy drinks, and candy.

==History==

===The 1990s===

The Jones Soda brand was started by Peter Van Stolk in 1995. Van Stolk was the president and founder of Urban Juice and Soda Company Ltd., a beverage distributor in Western Canada.

===The 2000s===
By 2000, over 85% of its revenues came from the Jones Soda brand, and the company officially changed its name to Jones Soda and moved its headquarters from Vancouver to Seattle. In November 2006, Jones Soda announced that it would replace high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in its products with cane sugar (in the form of an inverted syrup). On January 22, 2007, Jones Pure Cane Soda was launched in 12-ounce cans. By April 2007, all of the company&#x27;s products switched to cane sugar, except for its energy drinks, which changed that fall.

In 2007, the company announced an $11.6 million loss, due to the attempted expansion into the canned-soda market, whose barriers to entry were high against mass-produced Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

In 2008, Jones Soda announced a second-quarter loss and the downsizing of 42 employees (40% of its workforce), cutting costs a little over $2.6 million annually.

===The 2010s===

In March 2010, Jones Soda agreed to allow rival, Reed&#x27;s, Inc., to purchase the company at a steep discount. Later in the month, Jones backed out of the purchase. The company then named former Talking Rain president William Meissner as President and CEO.

In June 2010, the company announced a distribution deal with Walmart and $10 million in financing from Glengrove Small Cap Value Ltd.

In June 2011, Jones moved out of its South Lake Union headquarters to a building in Pioneer Square opposite CenturyLink Field.

In 2012, Jennifer Cue was hired as CEO.

In Spring 2015, Jones moved out of its Pioneer Square building to a larger space in Seattle.

===The 2020s===

In December 2020, Mark Murray was promoted to CEO.

==Beverage line==
Jones Soda was developed in 1995 and introduced in 1996 with six flavors: Orange, Cherry, Lemon-Lime, Strawberry-Lime, Raspberry, and Grape in 12 oz. glass bottles.

On March 17, 2004, a deal was announced to distribute Jones Soda in over 3900 Starbucks locations in the United States, though Starbucks stopped distributing Jones Soda in the United States as of 2007. On October 12, 2004, Jones Soda introduced 12oz cans for the first time with an exclusive distribution deal with Target, though other stores (including some Kmart, Food Pyramid, and Albertsons locations) now also sell the cans. Jones Soda was also sold at Ruby Tuesday restaurant.

Since the introduction of the original flavors, Jones has created many additional flavors.

===Slim and Sugar-Free===
In January 1999, Jones introduced the &quot;slim&quot; line of diet sodas but discontinued it in 2003 in favor of a sugar-free line. Its sugar-free formulas contain sucralose of the Splenda brand and acesulfame potassium, but no aspartame.

Four flavors were considered &quot;Mid-Calorie&quot;, including Twisted Lime, Watermelon, Tangerine, and Blueberry. These flavors were sweetened with Splenda, but still included 21 grams of sugar (compared to approximately 45–50 grams in the regular sodas).

In 2019, Jones introduced two new sugar-free flavors: SF Strawberry Lime, and SF Cream Soda. These flavors join sugar-free Cola on the current zero-sugar menu.

===Jones Organics===
In 2005, Jones announced a new line in its series: Jones Organics. The blends consist of six different tea-based flavors—two each of white tea, green tea, and red tea.

===Nuka Cola===
From 2009-10, Jones Soda produced a limited edition Nuka-Cola in collaboration with Target stores and Fallout series developer Bethesda Softworks. Jones&#x27; Nuka-Cola was re-released from 2014-16 and 2020-22 to capitalise on the release of Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. Flavours included the original Nuka-Cola, Nuka-Cherry, Nuka-Victory and blue Nuka-Cola Quantum. A new orange flavoured Nuka Cola Victory was released in 2024 during the launch of the Fallout TV series.

===7-Select===
In 2016, Jones Soda partnered with 7-Eleven to produce a line of five flavors available exclusively at the convenience store chain.

=== Mary Jones ===
In 2022, Jones announced a cannabis-infused soda and candy brand, Mary Jones. The brand was to be rolled out in California as a test market starting April 1, and in other legalized states later.

==Non-beverage products==

===Frozen soda pops===
In early 2005, Jones Soda entered the &quot;frozen novelty&quot; market with their Jones Frozen Soda Pops. They were available in Green Apple, Berry Lemonade, and Cherry soda flavors. The Jones Frozen Soda Pops were part of a three-year licensing agreement with Kroger, and are not currently available.

===Carbonated candy===
On October 19, 2005, a press statement was released in regards to Jones Soda&#x27;s licensing agreement with Big Sky Brands to produce a soda &quot;flavor booster&quot; candy. At the time, they announced that the candy&#x27;s three different flavors of &quot;Jones Soda Carbonated Candy&quot; would be Berry Lemonade, Fufu Berry, and Green Apple. The product was released in the United States in 2006. In 2007, the lineup was increased to six flavors, the three new flavors being Orange &amp; Cream, Cream Soda, and M.F. Grape.

Jones expanded its carbonated candy line further in 2006 to include &quot;Jones Soda Energy Boosters&quot;, which contain Niacin, Vitamin B12, Taurine, and Vitamin B6. Marketing literature says, &quot;1 tin of Jones Boosters = 3 Jones Energy Drinks&quot;.

In 2007, Big Sky Brands announced a contest to incorporate 24 user-submitted photos of crazy, distorted sour face &quot;cringes&quot; onto a new labeling of &quot;Jones Soda Carbonated Sours&quot;. They entered the market in 2008, initially in three flavors: Electric Lemonade, Limes with Orange, and Spiked Punch.

==Limited editions==

===2003===
The first special edition of Jones was the Jones Hot Wheels Pack, created in July 2003 to honor the 35th anniversary of Hot Wheels. The pack included a Hot Wheels Jones Soda Orange RV along with four themed bottles and was only available through the Jones Soda website.

In November 2003, Jones introduced a &quot;Turkey &amp; Gravy&quot; seasonal flavor in honor of Thanksgiving. Demand was so overwhelming that Jones sold out within two hours, the bottles (both full and empty) fetching in excess of $10 a piece on auction sites such as eBay.

===2004===
In 2004, it offered a complete, drinkable Thanksgiving dinner—five bottles—as a box set for $16. Turkey &amp; Gravy was brought back, and the rest of the flavors were unique to this offering: Green Bean Casserole, Cranberry, Mashed Potatoes with Butter, and Fruitcake. The limited-edition pack sold out in under an hour, temporarily crashing the company&#x27;s email and Internet servers. As in 2003, people resold some seasonal bottles on auction sites such as eBay, with bids reaching as high as $100 a pack. Jones Soda&#x27;s profits in both years were donated to the charity Toys for Tots.

===2005===
In 2005, Jones released Halloween Limited Edition 8 oz. can 4-packs, exclusively through Target. The four flavors included two originals (Candy Corn and Caramel Apple), as well as two renamed flavors (Strawberry Slime and Scary Berry Lemonade).

Flavors released at the end of October 2005 in many Target stores (and, eventually, via the Jones Soda website) included, as in 2004, five different varieties. &quot;Turkey &amp; Gravy&quot; and &quot;Cranberry&quot; made a return from 2004, with three new additions: Wild Herb Stuffing, Pumpkin Pie, and Brussels sprout. A list of wines, half-humorously included on a label on the front of the box, offered suggestions that would &quot;match&quot; with said flavors.

A second limited edition collection was also created in 2005, in part to celebrate the Seattle regional aspect of the company. This collection was also made available in other places across the United States, including select Speedway, Kroger, and Cost Plus World Market stores. The flavors differed from the first 2005 limited edition and included in addition to Turkey &amp; Gravy; Smoked Salmon Pâté, Corn on the Cob, Broccoli Casserole, and for dessert, Pecan Pie. As in years past, all profits from the Holiday Pack collections went to charities, in this case St. Jude&#x27;s Research Hospital and Toys for Tots.

===2006===
In February 2006, Jones introduced the first Valentines Pack. Each pack contained two bottles of &quot;Love Potion #6&quot; soda, a Love Potion No. 6 flavored lip balm, a three-track sampler CD, a book of &quot;Love Coupons&quot;, and a coupon for two free bottles of customized myJones. In addition to selling the packs through retailers and their website, Jones partnered with the non-profit organization, Operation AC, to donate 10,000 packs to U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In September 2006, Jones released the 10th Anniversary Pack, which included two &quot;current favorites&quot; (Green Apple and Blue Bubblegum), and two &quot;original favorites&quot; (Pineapple Upside Down and Raspberry), along with a Hot Wheels version of a Jones Van. The bottles were printed with special foil detailing and each pack was numbered with only 10,500 ever made, available only by ordering through their website.

The Halloween cans were available again in 2006 with the return of Candy Corn and Berried Alive (formerly Scary Berry Lemonade) and the new Spider Cider and Gruesome Grape (a renamed version of their regular flavor, MF Grape). Along with the cans, Limited Edition bottles were available in three flavors: Monster Mojito, Lemon Drop Dead, and Creepy Cranberry. Unlike previous Limited Edition bottles, these were available in the normal 4-pack carriers rather than special packages. Also in October 2006, Jones released the Berries and Cream Limited Edition pack to raise awareness for the Breast Cancer Recovery Foundation.

The 2006 Holiday Pack introduced some new flavors in addition to the now-classic Turkey &amp; Gravy, including Sweet Potato, Dinner Roll, Pea, and Antacid (which included a disclaimer stating it had no medicinal qualities). The second 2006 pack was dubbed the Dessert Pack and included Cherry Pie, Banana Cream Pie, Key Lime Pie, Apple Pie, and Blueberry Pie. Proceeds once again went to St. Jude&#x27;s and Toys for Tots. Three additional flavors (Egg Nog, Sugar Plum, and Candy Cane) were also created in 4-packs similar to the special Halloween bottles.

===2007===
In 2007 Jones Soda again sold the Valentines Pack, including the two bottles of Love Potion No. 6, a pair of Jones-branded boxer shorts, a box of Necco Conversation hearts, and a &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot; board printed on the back of the box.

In preparation for the Seattle Seahawks&#x27; 2007 season, Jones offered a limited-edition Seahawks pack starting on September 27. The collectors&#x27; pack included sodas flavored in Perspiration, Sports Cream, Natural Field Turf, Dirt, and Sweet Victory. In the Pacific Northwest, Jones labeled their regular sodas with Seahawks-themed pictures during the 2007 football season.

The Halloween edition mini-cans returned in October, featuring the new flavor Sour Lemon Drop Dead, along with returning flavors Candy Corn, Strawberry Slime, and Gruesome Grape. Three Target-exclusive flavors were also released: new flavors Black Cat Licorice (Black Licorice) and Dread Licorice (Red Licorice), along with returning flavor Monster Mojito.

Around Thanksgiving, Jones again released three flavors for the Holidays, exclusively at Target stores. Christmas Cocoa, Candy Cane, and Gingerbread each came in a 4-bottle carry pack. Additionally, the Dessert Pack was re-released with new flavor Lemon Meringue Pie, plus returning flavors Apple Pie, Cherry Pie, and Blueberry Pie.

In place of their annual Thanksgiving pack, Jones released two new holiday-themed sets. The 2007 Jones Holiday Packs offered choices for both Christmas and Chanukah. The 2007 Christmas Pack included new flavors Christmas Ham and Christmas Tree, along with returning flavors Egg Nog and Sugar Plum, with proceeds benefiting Toys for Tots. The 2007 Happy Hanukkah Pack was a four-bottle set of Latke, Applesauce, Chocolate Coins, and Jelly Doughnut sodas, and included &quot;1 completely functional dreidel;&quot; proceeds from Chanukah Pack sales benefited Vitamin Angels. Both holiday packs contained no caffeine. All sodas, including the ham-flavored soda, were certified kosher.

===2008===
For the first time, Jones released three new flavors in celebration of Easter: Robin&#x27;s Egg Lemonade, Chocolate Bunny, and Little Bunny Fufu. A portion of the proceeds benefited Vitamin Angels.

In April, Jones Soda ran a contest called the 10,000th label contest. Where fans would vote for their favorite photo of the Top 20 that Jones Soda picked. The winner would have the honor of their photo being on a special edition bottle. With over 5,000 votes cast, this is Jones Soda&#x27;s most popular contest so far.

In October Jones released, through Target, four 8 oz. Halloween soda cans came in four-packs. The flavors were paired with Classic movie monsters for each flavor. Lemon Drop Dead was the Mummy, Spooookiwi was Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, Candy Corn was the Wolf-man, and Buried Pomegranate was Count Dracula. Jones also came out with three 12 oz. glass bottle of Halloween soda consisting of Dread Apple, Blood Orange, and Monster Mojito.

Also in October, the company laid off 42 of its 110 employees, partly the result of the company&#x27;s expansion into the canned-soda market where it competed directly against Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

In November Jones released exclusively at Target stores three 12oz glass bottle Holiday sodas including Candy Cane, Pear Tree, Mele Kalikimaka (a pineapple and coconut combo), or &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; in Hawaiian. Jones also exclusively released on their website a six-pack of Green Apple, Red Apple, and Cream Soda as a Holiday color combo. Another net exclusive was the Apple Pie, Cherry Pie, and Blueberry Pie six-pack not so different from last year&#x27;s dessert pack.

In December Jones released their Hanukkah Pack was a four-bottle set of Latke, Applesauce, Chocolate Coins, and Jelly Doughnut sodas, and included &quot;1 completely functional dreidel;&quot;.

===2009===
To commemorate Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration, Jones released a new &#x27;Orange You Glad For Change&#x27; orange cola flavor, available from their website.

In February, Love Potion No. 6 was also made available from the official Jones website.

In June, Internet radio station Punk Radio Cast teamed up with Jones Soda to create a punk-pop 6 pack featuring labels designed by PunkRadioCast and five punk artists – New Found Glory, Less Than Jake, Bad Brains, Thursday, and The Gaslight Anthem. The 6-pack includes:
* Less Than Jake – Root Beer
* The Gaslight Anthem – Cream Soda
* New Found Glory – Fufu Berry
* Bad Brains – Rootz Beer
* Thursday – Cream Soda
* Punk Radio Cast – Strawberry Lime

When &quot;&quot; released a new core card set in July, Jones Soda coordinated to produce five limited edition bottles featuring Magic&#x27;s five colors of mana and artwork from Magic&#x27;s new Planeswalkers. The five sodas are titled Elixir of Purity (Cream Soda), Necromancer&#x27;s Tonic (Root Beer), Beast Brew (Green Apple), Illusion Infusion (Blue Bubblegum), and Purifying Firewater (Fruit Punch).

An exclusive set of bottles based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, called &#x27;Spellcasting Soda&#x27; was made available through the official Jones website. Sodas were titled Illithid Brain Juice, Sneak Attack, Potion of Healing, Dwarven Draught, Bigby&#x27;s Crushing Thirst Destroyer, and Eldritch Blast.

Halloween brought a return of several promotional flavors, exclusively at Target. Four-bottle packs of Monster Mojito, Dread Apple, and Blood Orange made a return. Four-can packs of Buried Pomegranate, Strawberry Slime, Lemon Drop Dead, Spookiwi, and Candy Corn were also re-released.

For Thanksgiving, the company introduced a new Tofurky and Gravy flavored soda that&#x27;s intended for vegetarians as an alternative option to turkey. A portion of proceeds were donated to the Progressive Animal Welfare Society (PAWS). The drink was also featured on an episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in a segment where band member Richie &quot;LaBamba&quot; Rosenberg (after Andy Richter refused to drink it) tried and disliked it.

===2013===

In 2013, Jones Soda created a poutine-flavored limited-edition soft drink, which got international popular culture attention.

In addition, the Halloween flavors were brought back for the fall season. The flavors this year included Return of Candy Corn, Terror of Blood Orange, Dawn of Caramel Apple, and Night of Red Licorice.

===2014===

To coincide with the back-to-school season, Jones Soda announced a limited-edition Peanut Butter and Jelly flavor.

Blood Orange and Caramel Apple returned for the Halloween season with similar packaging to 2013&#x27;s designs, but Red Licorice and Candy Corn were absent from the 2014 limited edition lineup of flavors.

===2015===

Peanut Butter and Jelly returned once again for the back-to-school season, while Blood Orange and Lemon Drop Dead were back for Halloween. A Thanksgiving favorite, Pumpkin Pie, also returned in 2015.

2015 also saw Jones Soda teaming up with video game publisher Bethesda to make a signature soft drink from one of Bethesda&#x27;s games slated for release in November. Nuka-Cola Quantum from the Fallout series went on sale on November 10 at participating Target locations in North America alongside the release of Bethesda&#x27;s game Fallout 4.

===2016===
Christmas themed soda returned in 2016 with Candy Cane, Sugar Plum, Pear Tree, and Gingerbread flavors.

==Labels==
 Jones Soda continually changes the photographs on its Soda and Naturals labels. The photos are generally black and white. Its website features a database of over one million submitted pictures, as well as an archived collection of internal company notes, detailing which pictures appeared when, on what flavors (for collectors of the images). Customers can also submit fortunes (similar to a fortune cookie) to be printed underneath the bottle cap.

The website sometimes asks for specific themes for photo uploads like the Patriot Photos or the Landmark Contest in order to create a special collection of labels. Recently, they have created a Signature series that includes photos and written signatures of Jones Soda Pro Athletes.

===myJones===
In 1999, Jones began selling Jones through a new section of their website in order to meet the growing demand of people wanting to circumvent the photo selection process. myJones is a customizable 12-pack of bottles with which anyone can have their picture and message. The creation process involves uploading a picture (with optional photo credit of up to 50 characters) and providing customization (up to 7 lines of 50 characters). The fortunes under the caps are not customizable.

Above the picture on the label, the word &quot;my&quot; is added before &quot;Jones Soda Co.&quot; to indicate it was customized and not bought at retail.

==Marketing==
Rather than television commercials or magazine ads, Jones chooses to focus on product placement. Athletes such as Benji Weatherley, Matt Hoffman, and Bam Margera, known as Jones Pro Riders, promote Jones by appearing with the logo (or often the actual product) at various events or on television appearances. Another group of athletes, the Jones Emerging Athletes, also support Jones.

Jones also employs two Jones Soda RVs which travel the West and East coasts of North America &quot;handing out soda and talking to the people on the street&quot;.

On May 23, 2007, the Seattle Seahawks chose Jones Soda as its official soft drink, and its products were sold at Qwest Field from the 2007 through the 2009 season. During the football season, Jones Soda also produced bottles labeled with photos of Seahawks players for sale both at football games and in supermarkets. The Seahawks previously sold soft drinks from The Coca-Cola Company; the Jones Soda deal made the team the first in the NFL to sign an exclusive deal with a soft drink company other than Coca-Cola or Pepsi. In June 2010, the Seahawks severed their association with Jones Soda and announced that they had signed a five-year agreement with Coca-Cola.

On February 12, 2008, Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air announced they would serve Jones Soda on their flights. This arrangement ended March 1, 2010, when Alaska and Horizon switched to serving Coca-Cola products. The airlines cited customer demand as the reason.

The 2009 February/March issue of the fine beverage publication, &quot; Mutineer&quot; Magazine, featured Jones Soda on the cover as well as an in-depth article about the company inside the magazine.

The company&#x27;s motto, &quot;Run with the little guy… create some change.&quot; appears on most Jones products.

Dr. Dre&#x27;s character in the 2001 film &quot;the Wash&quot; is seen drinking a Jones Soda.

Tahj Mowry&#x27;s and Aleisha Allen&#x27;s characters in the 2007 film &quot;Are We Done Yet?&quot; are seen drinking Jones Sodas.

<text>Lech Aleksander Kaczyński (; 18 June 194910 April 2010) was a Polish politician who served as the city mayor of Warsaw from 2002 until 2005, and as President of Poland from 2005 until his death in 2010. Before his tenure as president, he previously served as President of the Supreme Audit Office from 1992 to 1995 and later Minister of Justice and Public Prosecutor General in Jerzy Buzek&#x27;s cabinet from 2000 until his dismissal in July 2001.

Born in Warsaw, he starred in a 1962 Polish film, &quot;The Two Who Stole the Moon&quot;, with his identical twin brother Jarosław. Kaczyński was a graduate of law and administration of Warsaw University. In 1980, he was awarded his Ph.D. by Gdańsk University. In 1990, he completed his habilitation in labour and employment law. He later assumed professorial positions at Gdańsk University and Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw.

During the communist period, Kaczyński was an activist in the pro-democratic anti-communist movement in Poland, the Workers&#x27; Defence Committee, as well as the Independent Trade Union movement. In August 1980, he became an adviser to the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee in the Gdańsk Shipyard and the Solidarity movement. After the communists imposed martial law in December 1981, he was interned as an &quot;anti-socialist element&quot;. After his release, he returned to trade union activities, becoming a member of the underground Solidarity. When Solidarity was legalized again in the late 1980s, Kaczyński was an active adviser to Lech Wałęsa and his Solidarity Citizens&#x27; Committee in 1988.

From February to April 1989, he participated in the Polish Round Table Talks along with his brother. After Solidarity&#x27;s victory in the 1989 Polish legislative election, Kaczyński became a senator and vice-chairman of the movement. Then in the 1991 Polish parliamentary election, he was elected into the Sejm as a non-party member. He was also the main adviser and supporter of Lech Wałęsa when the latter was elected President of Poland in December 1990. Wałęsa nominated Kaczyński to be the Security Minister in the Presidential Chancellery but fired him in 1992 due to a conflict concerning Jan Olszewski&#x27;s government. In 2001, Kaczyński co-founded the Law and Justice party, after splitting from the Solidarity Electoral Action and the Christian National Union, along with his brother. Kaczyński was the party&#x27;s presidential candidate, during the 2005 Polish presidential election. In the first round of voting, Kaczyński received 33.1% of the valid votes. In the second round of voting, Kaczyński received 54.04% of the vote, defeating Donald Tusk, who received 45.96% of the vote. He was sworn in as president on 23 December 2005.

On 10 July 2006, Kaczyński appointed his brother as Prime Minister of Poland upon the resignation of Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, the brothers then became the first pair of brothers in the world to serve as president and Prime Minister of a country and the only twin brothers to do so, until 2007, when his brother lost the parliamentary election on 21 October 2007, finishing a distant second behind the conservative-liberal party Civic Platform. His brother was succeeded as prime minister by his former presidential rival Donald Tusk.

On 10 April 2010, Lech Kaczyński died, along with his wife, in the crash of a Polish Air Force jet that occurred on a landing attempt at Smolensk North Airport in Russia. He was the first Polish president to die in office since the assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz.

==Early life==
Kaczyński was born in Warsaw, the son of Rajmund (an engineer who served as a soldier of the Armia Krajowa in World War II and a veteran of the Warsaw Uprising), and Jadwiga (a philologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences). As a child, he starred in a 1962 Polish film, &quot;The Two Who Stole the Moon&quot; (Polish title &quot;O dwóch takich, co ukradli księżyc&quot;), with his identical twin brother Jarosław.

Kaczyński was a graduate of law and administration of Warsaw University. In 1980 he was awarded his PhD by Gdańsk University. In 1990 he completed his habilitation in labour and employment law. He later assumed professorial positions at Gdańsk University and Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw.

==Opposition to communism==
In the 1970s Kaczyński was an activist in the pro-democratic anti-communist movement in Poland, the Workers&#x27; Defence Committee, as well as the Independent Trade Union movement. In August 1980, he became an adviser to the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee in the Gdańsk Shipyard and the Solidarity movement. After the communists imposed martial law in December 1981, he was interned as an &quot;anti-socialist element&quot;. After his release, he returned to trade union activities, becoming a member of the underground Solidarity.

When Solidarity was legalized again in the late 1980s, Kaczyński was an active adviser to Lech Wałęsa and his Komitet Obywatelski Solidarność in 1988. From February to April 1989, he participated in the Round Table talks.

==Political activity from 1989 to 2005==
Kaczyński was elected senator in the elections of June 1989 and became the vice-chairman of the Solidarity trade union. In the 1991 parliamentary election, he was elected to the parliament as a non-party member. He was, however, supported by the electoral committee &quot;Center Civic Alliance&quot;, closely related but not identical to the political party Centre Agreement (&quot;Porozumienie Centrum&quot;) led by his brother. He was also the main adviser and supporter of Lech Wałęsa when the latter was elected President of Poland in December 1990. Wałęsa nominated Kaczyński to be the Security Minister in the Presidential Chancellery but fired him in 1992 due to a conflict concerning Jan Olszewski&#x27;s government.

Kaczyński was the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control (Najwyższa Izba Kontroli, NIK) from February 1992 to May 1995 and later Minister of Justice and Attorney General in Jerzy Buzek&#x27;s government from June 2000 until his dismissal in July 2001. During this time he was very popular because of his strong stance against corruption.

===Law and Justice===
In 2001 he founded the political party Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość – PiS), usually labelled &#x27;conservative&#x27; by media, with his brother Jarosław. Lech Kaczyński was the president of the party between 2001 and 2003.

===Mayor of Warsaw===

In 2002, Kaczyński was elected mayor of Warsaw in a landslide victory. He started his term in office by declaring war on corruption. He strongly supported the construction of the Warsaw Uprising Museum and in 2004 appointed a historical panel to estimate material losses that were inflicted upon the city by the Germans in the Second World War (an estimated 85% of the city was destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising) as a direct response to heightened claims coming from German expellees from Poland. The panel estimated the losses to be at least 45.3 billion euros ($54 billion) in current value. He also supported the construction of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw and was one of the signatories of the agreement to finance the project using the city funds.

====Interference with LGBT events====
Kaczyński banned the Warsaw gay pride parade twice in 2004 and again in 2005, locally known as the &quot;Parada Równości&quot; (the Equality Parade), telling protesters that &quot;I respect your right to demonstrate as citizens, but not as homosexuals.&quot; Additionally, he feared the parade would promote a &quot;homosexual lifestyle&quot; and complained that police did not use enough force in breaking it up by stating &quot;Why was force not used to break up an illegal demonstration?&quot;. Kaczyński referred to the organizers of the gay pride parades as &quot;perverts&quot;.

In 2005, Kaczyński allowed a counter-demonstration, the &quot;Parade of Normality&quot;, organized by the All-Polish Youth, a Catholic nationalist organization opposed to &quot;liberalism, tolerance, and relativism.&quot;

In 2007, Poland was found guilty by the European Court of Human Rights of violating the principle of freedom of assembly by banning the 2005 Parada Równości under Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

==Presidency 2005–2010==

===Presidential election===

On 19 March 2005, he formally declared his intention to run for president in the October 2005 election.

In the first round of the elections he polled 33% of the vote, taking second place behind Donald Tusk. By the second round, however, he had gained the support of Radio Maryja, as well as of two other political parties besides his own: Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, and the Polish People&#x27;s Party.

Elected President of the Republic of Poland (he defeated the runner-up Donald Tusk by polling 8,257,468 votes, constituting 54.04 percent of the vote), Kaczyński assumed office on 23 December 2005, taking an oath before the National Assembly.

===Domestic policy===

In his first public speech as president-elect, Kaczyński said that his presidency would pursue the task of ameliorating the Republic, a process which he said would consist of &quot;purging various pathologies from our life, most prominently crime [...], particularly criminal corruption – that entire, great rush to obtain unjust enrichment, a rush that is poisoning society, [and preventing the state from ensuring] elementary social security, health security, basic conditions for the development of the family [and] the security of commerce and the basic conditions for economic development.&quot;

During his inauguration he stated several goals he would pursue during his presidency. Among those concerning internal affairs were: increasing social solidarity in Poland, bringing justice to those who were responsible for, or were affected by communist crimes in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, fighting corruption, providing security in economy, and safety for development of family. Kaczyński also stated that he would seek to abolish economic inequalities between various regions of Poland. In his speech he also emphasized combining modernization with tradition and remembering the teachings of Pope John Paul II.

On 21 December 2008, Kaczyński became the first Polish head of state to visit a Polish synagogue and to attend religious services held there. His attendance coincided with the first night of Hanukkah.

Kaczyński supported the reintroducing the death penalty in Poland, clashing with the European Union over the issue in 2006.

===Presidential pardons===
From 2005 to 2007, in accordance with article 133 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, Kaczyński pardoned 77 people and declined to pardon 550.

===Foreign affairs===


In foreign policy, Kaczyński noted that many of Poland&#x27;s problems were related to the lack of energy security and this issue would have to be resolved to protect Polish interests. Strengthening ties with the United States while continuing to develop relations within the European Union are two main goals of Polish foreign affairs, as well as improving relations with France and Germany despite several problems in relations with the latter.
Aside from those issues, his immediate goals were to develop a tangible strategic partnership with Ukraine and greater co-operation with the Baltic states, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
He was greatly admired in Israel because he promoted educating Polish youth about the Holocaust. There was widespread grief in Israel over his death.

Defense Minister Radosław Sikorski compared the planned Russia to Germany gas pipeline to the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga stated that the pipeline was a threat to Poland&#x27;s energy security.

In November 2006 in Helsinki, at a European Union-Russia meeting, Poland vetoed the launch of EU-Russia partnership talks due to a Russian ban on Polish meat and plant products imports.

As a reaction to claims by a German exile group Preussische Treuhand, which represents post-1945 German expellees from Eastern Europe, the Polish Foreign Minister Fotyga mistakenly threatened to reopen a 1990 Treaty fixing the Oder and Neisse rivers as the border between the two countries instead of the Neighborhood Treaty signed in the same year.

Following the military conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008, Kaczyński provided the website of the President of Poland for dissemination of information for blocked by the Russian Federation Georgian internet portals. In a speech during the Russian aggression against Georgia, Kaczyński predicted: &quot;Today Georgia, tomorrow Ukraine, the Baltic States the day after tomorrow, and then perhaps the time will come for my country, Poland!&quot;

During a state visit to Serbia in 2009, Kaczyński said that the Polish government, on the basis of its constitutional competences, decided to recognize Kosovo and emphasized that he, as the President of the state, did not agree with that.

==Marriage and family==
Kaczyński married economist Maria Kaczyńska in 1978. They had one daughter, Marta Kaczyńska-Dubieniecka. His brother is Jarosław Kaczyński, the former Prime Minister of Poland.

==Death==
On 10 April 2010, a Tupolev Tu-154M plane was carrying Lech Kaczyński, his wife Maria Kaczyńska, and other members of a Polish delegation (top public and military figures) from Warsaw to commemorate the Katyn massacre. The plane crashed while approaching Smolensk Air Base in Russia. The governor of Smolensk Oblast confirmed to the Russia 24 news channel that there were no survivors. 96 people were killed in the crash, including many of Poland&#x27;s highest military and civilian leaders.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a government commission to investigate the crash. Russia&#x27;s Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, was placed in charge of the investigation.

Russian politician Valeriya Novodvorskaya later claimed the Russian government had murdered Kaczyński.

===State funeral===
On 11 April 2010, President Kaczyński&#x27;s body was returned to Poland, where he and his wife lay in state at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw. The state funeral was held in Kraków on 18 April 2010. After a Roman Catholic Mass at St. Mary&#x27;s Basilica, the presidential couple were laid to rest in a coffin, which was placed in the antechamber of the Crypt Under the Tower of Silver Bells beneath the Wawel Cathedral. A significant number of foreign dignitaries were unable to attend the funeral as a result of air travel disruption in Europe following the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland.

===Exhumation and post-mortem===

In June 2016, the Polish government announced it would re-open the investigation into the Smolensk jet crash with plans to exhume and autopsy all 96 of the victims. On 14 November 2016, the first of ten bodies, including Kaczyński&#x27;s, were exhumed. Kaczyński and his wife were reburied on 18 November 2016 after autopsies.

By 1 June 2017, exhumations of 27 coffins had been completed and DNA tests confirmed that 24 of those coffins, Kaczyński&#x27;s among them, showed evidence of mix-ups, including switched bodies, partial sets of remains and multiple remains in one grave.

<doc id="637434" wikidata="Q7245168" url="?curid=637434" title="Principle of rationality">
<text>The principle of rationality (or rationality principle) was coined by Karl R. Popper in his Harvard Lecture of 1963, and published in his book &quot;Myth of Framework&quot;. It is related to what he called the &#x27;logic of the situation&#x27; in an &quot;Economica&quot; article of 1944/1945, published later in his book &quot;The Poverty of Historicism&quot;. According to Popper&#x27;s rationality principle, agents act in the most adequate way according to the objective situation. It is an idealized conception of human behavior which he used to drive his model of situational analysis. Cognitive scientist Allen Newell elaborated on the principle in his account of knowledge level modeling.

==Popper==

Popper called for social science to be grounded in what he called &quot;situational analysis&quot; or &quot;situational logic&quot;. This requires building models of social situations which include individual actors and their relationship to social institutions, e.g. markets, legal codes, bureaucracies, etc. These models attribute certain aims and information to the actors. This forms the &#x27;logic of the situation&#x27;, the result of reconstructing meticulously all circumstances of an historical event. The &#x27;principle of rationality&#x27; is the assumption that people are instrumental in trying to reach their goals, and this is what drives the model. Popper believed that this model could be continuously refined to approach the objective truth.

Popper called his principle of rationality &quot;nearly empty&quot; (a technical term meaning without empirical content) and &quot;strictly speaking false&quot;, but nonetheless &quot;tremendously useful&quot;. These remarks earned him a lot of criticism because seemingly he had swerved from his famous &quot;Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot;.

Among the many philosophers having discussed Popper&#x27;s principle of rationality from the 1960s up to now are Noretta Koertge, R. Nadeau, Viktor J. Vanberg, Hans Albert, E. Matzner, Ian C. Jarvie, Mark A. Notturno, John Wettersten, Ian C. Böhm.

==Newell==

In the context of knowledge-based systems, Newell (in 1982) proposed the following principle of rationality: &quot;If an agent has knowledge that one of its actions will lead to one of its goals, then the agent will select that action.&quot; This principle is employed by agents at the knowledge level to move closer to a desired goal. An important philosophical difference between Newell and Popper is that Newell argued that the knowledge level is real in the sense that it exists in nature and is not made up. This allowed Newell to treat the rationality principle as a way of understanding nature and avoid the problems Popper ran into by treating knowledge as non physical and therefore non empirical.

<text>Anderson Javier Machado [ma-CHA-do] (born January 25, 1981) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball shortstop.

==Career==
Machado was signed as a non-drafted free agent by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1998. He made his debut in American professional baseball in 1999 when he played for the Rookie League Gulf Coast League Phillies, Class A Piedmont Boll Weevils, and Class A-Advanced Clearwater Phillies. In 2000 and 2001, he played for both Clearwater and the Double-A Reading Phillies. All of his 2002 season and the majority of his 2003 season was spent in Reading. Machado made his Major League debut on September 27, 2003, for the Philadelphia Phillies.

Early in the 2004 season, he played for Clearwater and the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons. On July 30, Machado was traded with Josh Hancock to Cincinnati Reds for Brad Correll and Todd Jones. He played in 17 games for the Reds, but also played for the Triple-A Louisville Bats. The 24-year-old shortstop began 2005 on the 15-day disabled list following offseason surgery to repair a torn medial collateral ligament and torn meniscus in his left knee. He appeared in two games for the Reds in 2005, both as a pinch hitter, and was 0-for-2 at the plate; he also spent time in Louisville. Machado was claimed off waivers on July 20 by the Colorado Rockies. He played four games for the Rockies in addition to playing for the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox.

After becoming a free agent following his time with the Rockies organization, he was signed to a minor league contract with the Reds. He played in 2006 with the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts, and 2007 with Triple-A Louisville. Machado wound up in the New York Mets system in 2008. During this time, he played with the Class A (Short Season) Brooklyn Cyclones, Double-A Binghamton Mets, and Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs.

Machado began the 2009 season in the Pittsburgh Pirates minor league system. He saw playing time with the Double-A Altoona Curve and Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. On May 28, 2009, he was traded to the Chicago Cubs for future considerations. He played for their Triple-A Iowa Cubs. After being released by the Cubs, Machado played for the independent Atlantic League&#x27;s Lancaster Barnstormers. In 2010, he was signed to a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers and played for their Double-A Huntsville Stars.

<text>Jarosław Aleksander Kaczyński (born 18 June 1949) is a Polish politician. He co-founded the Law and Justice (PiS) party in 2001 with his twin brother and has served as its long-time leader since 2003. He served as Prime Minister of Poland from 2006 to 2007, and has twice held the post of Deputy Prime Minister of Poland, first from 2020 to 2022, and a second time from June to November 2023. He is considered to have been the eminence grise of Poland, when PiS formed the government in 2005–2007 and again in 2015–2023, with direct political influence over the prime ministers Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, Beata Szydło and Mateusz Morawiecki.

Jaroslaw Kaczyński as a student took part in protest during the March 1968 political crisis. Subsequently, he became involved in the anti-communist opposition as a collaborator of KOR and KSS KOR. He took part in the protests in August 1980 when he was arrested, then joined the Solidarity movement. In 1982 he became a member of the Polish Helsinki Committee. He took part in the 1988 strikes.

In 1989, Kaczyński took part in the Round Table talks. In 1989–1991, he served as a senator. In 1990, he founded the Centre Agreement party, of which he served as leader until 1998. In 1990–91 he was head of the chancellery of President Lech Wałęsa. He served as a Member of Parliament from 1991 to 1993 and continuously since 1997.

In 2001 he co-founded the PiS party with his twin brother, Lech Kaczyński, of which he became leader in 2003. Running for PiS, he served as the prime minister of Poland from July 2006 to November 2007, while his brother was the president of Poland. After PiS&#x27;s electoral defeat in 2007, Kaczyński was the main leader of the opposition during Civic Platform&#x27;s governments. Following the death of his brother in a plane crash, Jarosław Kaczyński ran in the 2010 Polish presidential election, losing to Bronisław Komorowski.

Since the 2015 victories of PiS, both in the presidential and parliamentary election, Kaczyński was considered to be the most powerful politician in Poland and one of the most influential European leaders. In 2020, he was designated as the Deputy Prime Minister of Poland with oversight over the defense, justice and interior ministries. He resigned from the government in November 2023 after the Law and Justice (PiS) party failed to gain a majority of seats in the Sejm in the 2023 Polish parliamentary election.

==Early life==
Kaczyński was born on 18 June 1949, the identical twin brother of Lech Kaczyński. They were born in Warsaw. His father was (1922–2005), an engineer who served as a soldier in the Armia Krajowa in World War II, and his mother was (1925–2013), a philologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences who served in the Grey Ranks during the war.

As children, he starred with his brother in the 1962 Polish film &quot;The Two Who Stole the Moon&quot; (), based on a popular children&#x27;s story by Kornel Makuszyński. Kaczyński attended the Joachim Lelewel XLI High School, but due to failing to be promoted to the next grade he moved to the Mikołaj Kopernik XXXIII High School. He graduated from secondary school in 1967.

Kaczyński studied law at the Warsaw University&#x27;s Faculty of Law and Administration, where in 1976 he obtained a Doctor of Law (LL.D.) degree after completing a dissertation titled &quot;The role of collegial bodies in governing institutions of higher education&quot; under the supervision of . From 1971 to 1976, he was employed as a researcher at the Institute of Scientific Policy and Higher Education and then became an assistant professor at the Białystok branch of the University of Warsaw.

== Political career ==
===Anti-communist opposition===
During his studies, he took part in the student protests in March 1968. Kaczyński began working with the Workers&#x27; Defence Committee (KOR) in 1976. KOR was formed after the workers&#x27; protests of June 1976 to defend workers against persecution by the communist authorities. In 1976, he was stopped in time while carrying out tasks for the KOR during a journey to Płock. Subsequently, the KOR was transformed into the Committee for Social Self-Defense KOR (KSS KOR), which aimed to undertake broader dissident activities. Jarosław Kaczyński worked in the , run by Zbigniew Romaszewski and Zofia Romaszewska. Its task was to register all cases of human rights violations by the authorities, providing assistance to the repressed and those affected by the regime&#x27;s actions. Kaczyński investigated cases of murders committed by MO and SB officers.

Kaczyński also joined the editorial board of the monthly magazine &quot;Głos&quot; in 1979, which was associated with KSS KOR and headed by Antoni Macierewicz.

During the communist-era, Kaczyński worked for several opposition organizations including Workers&#x27; Defence Committee, Committee for Social Self-Defense, and the Solidarity trade union. Kaczyński was also the executive editor of the &quot;Tygodnik Solidarność&quot; weekly magazine from 1989 to 1991.

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, he created the conservative, Christian democratic Centre Agreement party and later became its chairman, remaining in the role until 1998. In the years 1991 to 1993 and since 1997, Kaczyński was a member of the Sejm. In the same year, he worked under direction of the president of Poland, Lech Wałęsa, as the head of his presidential chancellery. Wałęsa fired Kaczyński, who then led the protest movement against him.

===2005 elections===
Kaczyński was the Law and Justice prime ministerial candidate in the September 2005 Polish parliamentary election. However, when the party emerged as winner of the election, he pledged that he would not take the position, expecting that his nomination would reduce the chances of his brother Lech Kaczyński, who was a candidate for the October presidential election. Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz was appointed prime minister.

In the following months, he was a frontbench MP and the leader of his party. He was said to have an enormous influence on the prime minister&#x27;s decision-making process. Kaczyński was described as the architect of the coalition with the populist Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland () and the far-right League of Polish Families party.

===Prime Minister: 2006–2007===

Following reports of a rift between Kaczyński and Marcinkiewicz, the latter resigned on 7 July 2006. Kaczyński was appointed prime minister by his brother, the president, Lech Kaczyński, on 10 July, and sworn in on 14 July, following the formation of a cabinet and a confidence vote in the Sejm. They were the first pair of brothers in the world to serve as president and prime minister of a country and the only twin brothers to have done so. The following 15 months were erratic and not without controversy, Kaczyński initiated a nationwide program (&quot;Lustracja&quot;) which required thousands of public employees, teachers, and journalists to formally declare whether or not they had collaborated with the security services of the former communist regime.
In 2006, Kaczyński also established a Central Anticorruption Bureau (Polish: &quot;Centralne Biuro Antykorupcyjne&quot;) with far-reaching powers and was embroiled in a case relating to the suicide of Barbara Bilda who was under investigation for corruption. The government also modified Polish foreign relations relating to the European Union by adopting a more eurosceptical stance, where Polish governments had in the past adopted a very pro-European Union position.

At the request of his government, taxes were reduced.

===2007 parliamentary election===
Despite gaining votes, Law and Justice lost the parliamentary election on 21 October 2007, finishing a distant second behind the pro-European and liberal-conservative party Civic Platform. Kaczyński was succeeded as prime minister by Donald Tusk, but remained chairman of Law and Justice and became leader of the opposition.
===2010 presidential election===
Following the death of his brother, Jarosław announced that he would run for president against Bronisław Komorowski in the election held on 20 June 2010. Joanna Kluzik-Rostkowska ran his electoral campaign staff and the spokesperson was Paweł Poncyljusz. Kaczyński appeared to soften his image during the campaign in order to win centrist voters. The campaign&#x27;s motto was &quot;Poland Comes First&quot;. He polled 36.5% of the vote in the first round, against the acting president Bronisław Komorowski&#x27;s 41.5%. In the second round he lost with 47.0% of the vote to Komorowski&#x27;s 53.0%.

===After 2015===

In order to win over moderate voters, rather than running as PiS&#x27;s candidate for president or prime minister, Kaczyński put forward more moderate PiS members in the 2015 presidential and parliamentary elections. Andrzej Duda ran as PiS&#x27;s presidential candidate, while Beata Szydło was its candidate for prime minister. PiS won both elections. In the parliamentary election, PiS became the first party to win an outright majority since the end of communism. But despite being a popular leader among PiS&#x27;s base, he himself remains unpopular among the wider public, with some polls showing that more Poles think Kaczyński is not trustworthy compared to Duda or Szydło. In 2017, &quot;Politico&quot; described him as the de facto ruler of Poland and as one of the most influential politicians in Poland.

In 2020, Kaczyński became deputy prime minister in the Mateusz Morawiecki government. Kaczyński announced in mid-October 2021 that he would step down as the deputy prime minister at the beginning of 2022 in order to focus on his leadership of his party, and stepped down on 21 June 2022.

On 10 April 2020, on the anniversary of the Smolensk air disaster, Kaczyński and nine other people, standing close together, visited the grave of Kaczynski&#x27;s mother and the symbolic grave of twin-brother Lech at Powązki Military Cemetery, though they were closed to the public due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. The Polish Police stated that the gathering in Powązki did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the pandemic, this caused controversy and criticism. The former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the restrictions. 

In May, a Polish radio station Trójka (run by state-owned broadcaster Polskie Radio) was accused of censoring &quot;Twój ból jest lepszy niż mój&quot; (&quot;Your Pain is Better Than Mine&quot;), a song by Kazik Staszewski that is critical of Law and Justice. The song was inspired by Kaczyński&#x27;s actions and does not reference the party or Kaczyński by name. When &quot;Twój ból jest lepszy niż mój&quot; charted at number one on Trójka&#x27;s weekly countdown on 15 May, the station subsequently suppressed the chart and all references to the song from its website. Station director Tomasz Kowalczewski accused the programme&#x27;s host Marek Niedźwiecki of having rigged the chart in favour of Kazik&#x27;s song. Bartosz Gil — who also works on the chart show — alleged that Kaczyński&#x27;s claim was false, and accused him of specifically targeting the song. The following Sunday, Niedźwiecki announced his immediate resignation from the station, and also threatened legal action against the broadcaster for false claims of fraud. On 16 May, Polskie Radio music head Piotr Metz revealed that, after the chart show aired, Kowalczewski had ordered him via text message to remove &quot;Twój ból jest lepszy niż mój&quot; from the station&#x27;s music library. Metz also resigned from the station. The station also faced threats of boycotts from members of the Polish music industry.

==Political views==
Kaczyński&#x27;s project is said to consist of a &quot;moral revolution&quot; culminating in the creation of a &quot;fourth republic&quot; drawing a radical break from the compromises surrounding the fall of Communism in Poland, as well as reverting Poland back to its conservative, Roman Catholic roots and away from a multi-cultural styled Western European mainstream. In April 2016, he stated that he is not going to run for the office of President or Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland in the upcoming elections.

Drawing from his strong, uncompromising views (especially regarding parts of the political, cultural and media environment, which he sees as remnants or heirs of the former communist networks), Kaczyński is often labelled as &quot;polarizing&quot;.

In recent years, he was also known as an activist for animal rights, and, among other things, undertook activities aimed at banning the breeding of fur animals.

A pejorative term for ideology of Jarosław Kaczyński used by some of his political opponents is &quot;Kaczyzm&quot;.

Kaczyński is a Eurosceptic, and he pejoratively stated that &quot;Germany wants to turn the European Union into Fourth Reich&quot;.

===LGBT views===

On 21 September 2005, Kaczyński said that &quot;homosexuals should not be isolated, however, they should not be school teachers for example. Active homosexuals surely not, in any case&quot;, but that they &quot;should not be discriminated otherwise&quot;. He has also stated, &quot;The affirmation of homosexuality will lead to the downfall of civilization. We can&#x27;t agree to it&quot;. On 30 August 2006, during a visit to the European Commission, Kaczyński, as the Prime Minister, stated that &quot;people with such preferences have full rights in Poland, there is no tradition in Poland of persecuting such people&quot;. He also asked the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso &quot;not to believe in the myth of Poland as an anti-Semitic, homophobic and xenophobic country&quot;.

In 2019, Kaczyński characterized the LGBT rights movement as a foreign import that threatens the Polish nation. He also stated that everyone must recognize Christianity and questioning the Roman Catholic Church in Poland as unpatriotic: &quot;We are dealing with a direct attack on the family and children — the sexualization of children, that entire LGBT movement, gender. This is imported, but they today actually threaten our identity, our nation, its continuation and therefore the Polish state.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Kaczyński is a practicing Roman Catholic. He is a lifelong bachelor and has no partner or children. He lived with his ailing mother until her hospitalization. He owns no computer and is said to have opened his first bank account only in 2009. On December 7, 2024 Kaczyński joined the social networking service X (formerly known as Twitter). He owns two cats and has been described as a &quot;feline enthusiast&quot;.

The communist-era Security Service (SB) files described Kaczyński as &quot;...very uncertain about his fate. His appearance is careless. He claimed that he was not interested in material matters, women, e.g. he does not care about having a family in the future. He has a phlegmatic disposition, the appearance of a bookworm.&quot; The files also noted that he was not willing to cooperate with the SB in any capacity.

== In popular culture ==
The main character of the political satire web series &quot;The Chairman&#x27;s Ear&quot;, chairman Jarosław (portrayed by series creator Robert Górski), is modeled on Kaczyński.

<text>The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (also known as the Los Angeles Coliseum or L.A. Coliseum) is a multi-purpose stadium in the Exposition Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Conceived as a hallmark of civic pride, the Coliseum was commissioned in 1921 as a memorial to Los Angeles veterans of World War I. Completed in 1923, it will become the first stadium to have hosted the Summer Olympics three times when it hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics, previously hosting in 1932 and 1984. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 27, 1984, a day before the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics.

The stadium serves as the home of the University of Southern California Trojans football team of the Big Ten Conference, and is located directly adjacent to the school&#x27;s main University Park campus.

The Coliseum is jointly owned by the State of California&#x27;s Sixth District Agricultural Association, Los Angeles County, and the City of Los Angeles. It is managed and operated by the Auxiliary Services Department of the University of Southern California (USC).

USC granted naming rights to United Airlines in January 2018. After concerns were raised by the Coliseum Commission, which has public oversight of USC&#x27;s management and operation of the Coliseum, the airline agreed to become the title sponsor of the playing field, naming it United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

The Coliseum was the home of the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL) from 1946 to 1979, when they moved to Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, and again from 2016 to 2019, prior to the team&#x27;s move to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. The facility had a permanent seating capacity of 93,607 for USC football and Rams games, making it the largest football stadium in the Pac-12 Conference and the NFL. The stadium also was the temporary home of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1958 to 1961, and was the host venue for games three, four, and five of the 1959 World Series. It was the site of the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game (later called Super Bowl I) and Super Bowl VII. Additionally, it has served as a home field for a number of other teams, including the 1960 inaugural season for the Los Angeles Chargers, the Los Angeles Raiders of the NFL from 1982 to 1994, and UCLA Bruins football.

From 1959 to 2016, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena was located adjacent to the Coliseum before it closed in March 2016. BMO Stadium, formerly Banc of California Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium and the home of Major League Soccer (MLS)&#x27;s Los Angeles FC, was constructed on the former Sports Arena site, and opened in 2018.

In 2019, USC completed a two year long major renovation of the stadium that included replacing the seating along with the addition of luxury boxes and club suites. The $315 million project, funded solely by the university and managed by architectural firm DLR Group, was the first major upgrade of the stadium in twenty years. The improvements and added amenities resulted in a reduced stadium capacity from 92,348 to 77,500.

==Operation==
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, which consists of six voting members appointed by the three ownership interests and meets on a monthly basis, provides public oversight of the master lease agreement with USC. Under the lease, the university has year-round day-to-day management and operation responsibility for both the Coliseum and BMO Stadium properties. USC&#x27;s Vice President of Auxiliary Services is the Chief Operating Officer of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and Coliseum employees are employees of the university.

Until 2013, USC had a series of mostly one and two year agreements with the Coliseum Commission – which up to that time had been directly operating the stadium. Those agreements were limited to the university only renting the stadium for USC home football games. On July 29, 2013, after the previously governing Coliseum Commission failed to deliver promised renovations, the Coliseum Commission and USC implemented a significantly more extensive master lease agreement that transferred to USC the responsibility for the long-term management and operation of both the Coliseum and the adjacent BMO Stadium property and the capital renewal of the Coliseum. The 98-year agreement required the university to make approximately $100 million in initial physical repairs to the Coliseum. Additionally, it requires USC pay $1.3 million each year in rent to the State of California for the state-owned land the property occupies in Exposition Park; maintain the Coliseum&#x27;s physical condition at the same standard used on the USC Campus; and assume all financial obligations for the operations and maintenance of the Coliseum and BMO Stadium Complex.

===USC===
The Coliseum is primarily the home of the &quot;USC Trojans&quot; football team. Most of USC&#x27;s regular home games, especially the alternating games with rivals UCLA and Notre Dame, attract a capacity crowd. The current official capacity of the Coliseum is 77,500, with 42 suites, 1,100 club seats, 24 loge boxes, and a 500-person rooftop terrace. USC&#x27;s women lacrosse and soccer teams use the Coliseum for selected games, usually involving major opponents and televised games. USC also rents the Coliseum to various events, including international soccer games, musical concerts and other large outdoor events.

In May 2021, due to the previous year of local COVID-19 restrictions, USC held commencement ceremonies in the Coliseum for graduating students from the classes of 2020 and 2021. Ceremonies were held in the Coliseum twice a day for a week, with over 36,000 diplomas (including undergraduate and graduate degrees and certificates) were awarded. It was the first time in 70 years that USC had held its commencement in the stadium. In September 2024 the university announced that its main commencement ceremony was regularly attracting more than 60,000 guests and had outgrown all venues on campus, and beginning with the May 2025 ceremony it would be moving to the Coliseum.

==History==
===Planning===
The Coliseum was commissioned in 1921 as a memorial to L.A. veterans of World War I (rededicated to all United States veterans of the war in 1968). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 21, 1921, with construction being completed in just over 16 months, on May 1, 1923. Designed by John and Donald Parkinson, the original bowl&#x27;s initial construction costs were $954,873. When the Coliseum opened in 1923, it was the largest stadium in Los Angeles, with a capacity of 75,144. In 1930, however, with the Olympics due in two years, the stadium was extended upward to seventy-nine rows of seats with two tiers of tunnels, expanding the seating capacity to 101,574. The physical structure of a bowl-shaped configuration for the Coliseum was undoubtedly inspired by the earlier Yale Bowl which was built in 1914. The now-signature Olympic torch was added, and the stadium was briefly known as Olympic Stadium. The Olympic cauldron torch which burned through both Games remains above the peristyle at the east end of the stadium as a reminder of this, as do the Olympic rings symbols over one of the main entrances. Originally for the 1984 games, burnable Olympic Rings and a 25-step hydraulic staircase were added inside in the front of the coliseum to allow the cauldron to be lit by lifting up the stairs to the burnable Olympic Rings, which brought the flame to the cauldron on top. The football field runs east to west with the press box on the south side of the stadium.

The current jumbotrons to each side of the peristyle were installed in 2017, and replaced a scoreboard and video screen that towered over the peristyle dating back to 1983; they replaced a smaller scoreboard above the center arch installed in 1972, which in turn supplanted the 1937 model, one of the first all-electric scoreboards in the nation. Over the years new light towers have been placed along the north and south rims. The large analog clock and thermometer over the office windows at either end of the peristyle were installed in 1955. In the mid- and late 1950s, the press box was renovated, and the &quot;Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum&quot; lettering and Olympic rings, lighted at night, were added to the eastern face of the peristyle tower. Between the double peristyle arches at the east end is the Coliseum&#x27;s &quot;Court of Honor&quot; plaques, recognizing many of the memorable events and participants in its history, including a full list of 1932 and 1984 Olympic gold medalists (the complete roster of honorees can be seen below).

===Renovations===
For many years, the Coliseum was capable of seating over 100,000 spectators. In 1964, the stadium underwent its first major renovation in over three decades. Most of the original pale green wood-and-metal bench seating was replaced by individual theater-type chairs of dark red, beige and yellow; these seats remained until 2018, although the yellow color was eliminated in the 1970s. The seating capacity was reduced to approximately 93,000.

The Coliseum was problematic as an NFL venue. At various times in its history, it was either the largest or one of the largest stadiums in the league. While this allowed the Rams and Raiders to set attendance records, it also made it extremely difficult to sell out. The NFL amended its blackout rule to allow games to be televised locally if they were sold out 72 hours before kickoff. However, due to the Coliseum&#x27;s large size, Rams (and later Raiders) games were often blacked out in Southern California, even in the teams&#x27; best years.

From 1964 to the late 1970s, it was common practice to shift the playing field to the closed end of the stadium and install end zone bleachers in front of the peristyle, limiting further the number of seats available for sale. For USC–UCLA and USC–Notre Dame games, which often attracted crowds upward of 90,000, the bleachers were moved eastward and the field was re-marked in its original position. When a larger east grandstand was installed between 1977 and 1978, at the behest of Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom, the capacity was just 71,500. With the upcoming 1984 Summer Olympic Games, and under the direction of H. D. Thoreau Jr., a new track was installed and the playing field permanently placed inside it. A new scoreboard was also installed in 1983 prior to the 1984 Olympics. However, the combination of the stadium&#x27;s large, relatively shallow design, along with the presence of the track between the playing field and the stands, meant that some of the original end zone seats were as far from the field by the equivalent length of another football field. To address these and other problems, the Coliseum underwent a $15 million renovation before the 1993 football season, which included the following:

* The field was lowered by and 14 new rows of seats replaced the running track, bringing the first row of seats closer to the playing field (a maximum distance of at the eastern 30-yard-line).
* A portable seating section was built between the eastern endline and the peristyle bleachers (the stands are removed for concerts and similar events).
* The locker rooms and public restrooms were &quot;modernized.&quot;
* The bleachers were replaced with individual seating.

Additionally, for Raiders home games, tarpaulins were placed over seldom-sold sections, reducing seating capacity to approximately 65,000. The changes were anticipated to be the first of a multi-stage renovation designed by HNTB that would have turned the Coliseum into a split-bowl stadium with two levels of mezzanine suites (the peristyle end would have been left as is). However, after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the $93 million was required from government agencies (including the Federal Emergency Management Agency) to repair earthquake damage, and the renovations demanded by the Raiders were put on hold indefinitely. The Raiders then redirected their efforts toward a proposed stadium at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood before electing to move back to the Oakland Coliseum prior to the 1995 NFL season. In 2000, Bentley Management Group (BMG) was hired as the project manager to complete work at the Coliseum and Sports Arena funded by FEMA. In addition to seismically bracing the Sports Arena while it remained open for events, BMG also coordinated the Coliseum&#x27;s new press box elevator, various concession stands, restroom improvements, and concrete spalling repairs.

====New videoboard====
In August 2011, construction began on the Coliseum&#x27;s west end on a new HD video scoreboard, accompanying the existing video scoreboard on the peristyle (east end) of the stadium. The video scoreboard officially went into operation on September 3, 2011, at USC football&#x27;s home opener versus the University of Minnesota, with the game being televised on ABC.

====2018–2019 renovation project====
After USC took over the Coliseum master lease in 2013, they began making plans for major renovations needed and as stipulated in the master lease agreement. On October 29, 2015, USC unveiled an estimated $270 million project for a massive renovation and restoration the Coliseum. The upgrades included: replacing all seats in the stadium, construction of a larger and modern press box (with new box suites, premium lounges, a viewing deck, a V.I.P. section, and the introduction of LED ribbon boards), adding new aisles and widening some seats, a new sound system, restoration and renaming of the peristyle to the Julia and George Argyros Plaza, stadium wide Wi-Fi, two new HD video jumbotrons, new concession stands, upgraded entry concourses, new interior and exterior lighting, modernization of plumbing and electrical systems, and a reduction in capacity of about 16,000 seats, with the final total at approximately 78,500 seats.

The plans were met with mixed reactions from the public. The Los Angeles 2028 Olympic bid committee contemplated additional renovations to support its bid.

On January 8, 2018, USC began the project to renovate and improve the Coliseum. The project, which was solely funded by the university, was completed by the 2019 football season, and was the first major upgrade of the stadium in 20 years. The project budget increased from the initial estimate of $270 million to $315 million mainly due to the tight construction schedule.

===Naming rights===
On January 29, 2018, Chicago-based United Airlines became the stadium&#x27;s first naming rights partner. Originally, Memorial Coliseum was to be retained in the name of the stadium by the condition of the Coliseum Commission&#x27;s requirement in its master lease agreement with USC. However, veterans groups and the new president of the Coliseum Commission raised concern about the new name, while United did not approve of any change from the stadium and stated that they were willing to step away from the deal.

On March 29, 2019, USC suggested the name United Airlines Field at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum instead of the planned United Airlines Memorial Coliseum. Although United also did not support this and considered withdrawal, the two parties agreed to the name on June 7.

During Los Angeles Rams home games for the 2019 season, the stadium reverted to its original name, and all signage indicating &quot;United Airlines Field&quot; was covered due to the franchise&#x27;s sponsoring partnership with American Airlines.

===Notable events===
====1920s====

On October 6, 1923, Pomona and USC played in the inaugural game at the Coliseum, with the Trojans prevailing 23–7. Situated just across the street from Exposition Park, USC agreed to play all its home games at the Coliseum, a circumstance that contributed to the decision to build the arena.

From 1928 to 1981, the UCLA Bruins also played home games at the Coliseum. When USC and UCLA played each other, the &quot;home&quot; team (USC in odd-numbered years, UCLA in even), occupied the north sideline and bench, and its band and rooters sat on the north side of the stadium; the &quot;visiting&quot; team and its contingent took to the south (press box) side of the stadium. Excepting the mid-1950s and 1983–2007, the two teams have worn their home jerseys for the rivalry games for the Victory Bell. This tradition was renewed in 2008, even though the two schools now play at different stadiums. UCLA moved to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena in 1982.

====1930s–1940s====
In 1932, the Coliseum hosted the Summer Olympic Games, the first of two Olympic Games hosted at the stadium. The Coliseum served as the site of the field hockey, gymnastics, the show jumping part of the equestrian event, and track and field events, along with the opening and closing ceremonies. The 1932 games marked the introduction of the Olympic Village, as well as the victory podium.

The former Cleveland Rams of the National Football League relocated to the Coliseum in 1946, becoming the Los Angeles Rams; however, the team later relocated again, first to Anaheim in 1980, then to St.Louis in 1995, only to move back to Los Angeles in 2016. The Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference played in the Coliseum from 1946 to 1949, when the franchise merged with its NFL cousins just before the two leagues merged. The Coliseum hosted the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 1934, 1939, 1949, and 1955. It also hosted several Coliseum Relays and several Compton-Coliseum Invitational (track and field) events from the 1940s until the 1970s.

====1950s–1960s====

Among other sporting events held at the Coliseum over the years were Major League Baseball (MLB) games, which were held when the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League relocated to the West Coast in 1958. The Dodgers played here until Dodger Stadium was completed in time for the 1962 season. The Coliseum was extremely ill-suited even as a temporary baseball venue due to the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of football and baseball fields. A baseball field requires roughly 2.5 times more area than a football gridiron, but the playing surface was just barely large enough to accommodate a baseball diamond. As a result, foul territory was almost nonexistent down the first base line, but was expansive down the third base line, with a very large backstop for the catcher. Sight lines also left much to be desired; some seats were as far as from the plate. Also, from baseball&#x27;s point of view, the locker rooms were huge as they were designed for football (not baseball) teams.

Even allowing for its temporary status, the corners that were cut in order to shoehorn even an approximation of a baseball field onto the playing surface were especially severe. The left-field fence was set at only from the plate. This seemed likely to ensure that there would be many &quot;Chinese home runs&quot;, as such short shots were called at the time. Sportswriters began jokingly referring to the improvised park as &quot;O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s Chinese Theatre&quot; or &quot;The House that Charlie Chan Built&quot;, drawing protests from the Chinese American community in the Los Angeles area. They also expressed concern that cherished home run records, especially Babe Ruth&#x27;s 1927 seasonal mark of 60, might be in danger. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; titled a critical editorial &quot;Every Sixth Hit a Homer!&quot; Players also complained, with Milwaukee Braves ace Warren Spahn calling for a rule that would require any home run to travel at least before it could be considered a home run.

Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick ordered the Dodgers to erect a screen in left field to prevent 251-foot pop flies from becoming home runs. Its cables, towers, wires, and girders were in play. The &quot;short porch&quot; in left field looked extremely attractive to batters. In the first week of play during the 1959 season, the media&#x27;s worst preseason fears seemed to be realized when 24 home runs were hit in the Coliseum, three of them by Chicago Cubs outfielder Lee Walls, not especially distinguished as a hitter. However, pitchers soon adapted, throwing outside to right-handed hitters, requiring them to pull the bat hard if they wanted to hit toward left. Perhaps no player took better advantage than Dodgers outfielder Wally Moon, who figured out how to hit high fly balls that dropped almost vertically just behind the screen. By the end of the season, he had hit 19 homers, all but five of them in the Coliseum. In recognition, such homers were dubbed &quot;Moon Shots&quot;.

Nonetheless, the number of home runs alarmed Frick enough that he ordered the Dodgers to build a second screen in the stands, from the plate. A ball would have had to clear both screens to be a home run; if it cleared the first, it would have been a ground-rule double. However, the Dodgers discovered that the earthquake safety provisions of the Los Angeles building code forbade construction of a second screen.

Unable to compel the Dodgers to fix the situation, the major leagues passed a note to Rule 1.04 stating that any stadium constructed after June 1, 1958, must provide a minimum distance of down each foul line. Also, when the expansion Los Angeles Angels joined the American League in 1961, Frick vetoed their original request to use the Coliseum as a temporary facility. This rule was revoked (or perhaps, simply ignored) when the Baltimore Orioles launched the &quot;retro ballpark&quot; era in 1992, with the opening of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. With a right field corner of only , this fell short. However, baseball fans heartily welcomed the &quot;new/old&quot; style, and all new ballparks since then have been allowed to set their own distances.

Late that season, the screen figured in the National League pennant race. When the Braves were playing the Dodgers at the Coliseum on September 15, 1959, Joe Adcock hit a ball that cleared the screen but hit a steel girder behind it and got stuck in the mesh. According to ground rules, this should have been a home run. However, the umpires ruled it a ground-rule double. The fans shook the screen, causing the ball to fall into the seats. The umpires changed the call to a homer, only to rule it a ground-rule double while Adcock was left stranded on second. The game was tied at the end of nine innings, and the Dodgers won in the tenth inning. At the end of the regular season, the Dodgers and Braves finished in a tie. The Dodgers won the ensuing playoff and went on to win the World Series.

Although less than ideal for baseball due to its poor sight lines and short dimensions (left field at and power alleys at ), the Coliseum was ideally suited for large paying crowds. Each of the three games of the 1959 World Series drew over 92,000 fans, with game five drawing 92,706, a record unlikely to be seriously threatened anytime soon given the smaller seating capacities of today&#x27;s baseball parks. In May 1959, an exhibition game between the Dodgers and the New York Yankees in honor of legendary catcher Roy Campanella drew 93,103, the largest crowd ever to see a baseball game in the Western Hemisphere until a 2008 exhibition game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox to mark the 50th anniversary of MLB in Los Angeles. The Coliseum also hosted the second 1959 MLB All-Star Game.

The Coliseum was also the site of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s memorable acceptance speech at the 1960 Democratic National Convention. It was during that speech that Kennedy first used the term &quot;the New Frontier&quot;.

The Rams hosted the 1949, 1951 and 1955 NFL championship games at the Coliseum. The Coliseum was also the site of the first NFL–AFL Championship Game in 1967, an event since renamed the Super Bowl. It also hosted Super Bowl VII in 1973, but future Super Bowls in the Los Angeles region would instead be hosted at the Rose Bowl, which has never had an NFL tenant. The Coliseum was also the site of the NFL Pro Bowl from 1951 to 1972, and again in 1979. In 1960, the American Football League (AFL)&#x27;s Los Angeles Chargers played at the Coliseum before relocating to San Diego the next year; the team moved back to the L.A. area in 2017.

The United States men&#x27;s national soccer team played its first match at the stadium in 1965, losing to Mexico in a 1966 World Cup qualifier. Also, the Los Angeles Wolves of the United Soccer Association played their home games at the Coliseum for a year (1967) before moving to the Rose Bowl.

====1970s–1980s====
In June 1970, the first Senior Olympics (known as the Senior Sports International Meet) took place at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. In July 1972, the Coliseum hosted the &quot;Super Bowl&quot; of Motocross. The event was the first motocross race held inside a stadium. It evolved into the AMA Supercross championship held in stadiums across the United States and Canada. The Coliseum last hosted the event in 1998. On August 20, 1972, Wattstax, also known as &quot;Black-Woodstock&quot;, took place in the Coliseum. Over 100,000 black residents of Los Angeles attended this concert for African-American pride. Later in 1973, a documentary was released about the concert.

In 1973, Evel Knievel used the entire distance of the stadium to jump 50 stacked cars. Knievel launched his motorcycle from atop one end of the Coliseum, jumping the cars in the center of the field, and stopping high atop the other end. The jump was broadcast on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. Also in 1973, the Coliseum was host to Super Bowl VII, which saw the AFC champion Miami Dolphins defeat the NFC champion Washington Redskins 14–7, becoming the only team in NFL history to attain an undefeated season and postseason. The Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group hosted the first stadium short course off-road race at the Coliseum in 1979. The event was last held in 1992. 

The Los Angeles Rams played their home games in the Coliseum until 1979, when they moved to Anaheim prior to the 1980 NFL season. They hosted the NFC Championship Game in 1975 and 1978, in which they lost both times to the Dallas Cowboys by lopsided margins. The Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer League used the Coliseum as their home ground in 1977 and 1981.

The Coliseum was also home to the USFL&#x27;s Los Angeles Express between 1983 and 1985. In this capacity, the stadium also is the site of the longest professional American football game in history: on June 30, 1984 (a few weeks before the start of the 1984 Summer Olympics), a triple-overtime game between the Express and the Michigan Panthers that was decided on a 24-yard game-winning touchdown by Mel Gray of the Express, three and a half minutes into the third overtime, to give Los Angeles a 27–21 win. Until 2012, this game marked the only time in the history of professional football that there was more than one kickoff in overtime play in the same game. In 1982, the former Oakland Raiders moved in. The same year, UCLA decided to move its home games to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.

The Coliseum was also the site of the 1982 Speedway World Final, held for the first and only time in the United States. The event saw Newport Beach native Bruce Penhall retain the title he had won in front of 92,500 fans at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium in 1981. An estimated 40,000 fans were at the Coliseum to see Penhall retain his title before announcing his retirement from motorcycle speedway to take up an acting role on the television series &quot;CHiPs&quot;.

Los Angeles hosted the 1984 Summer Olympics, and the Coliseum became the first stadium to host the Summer Olympic Games twice, again serving as the primary track and field venue and as the site of the opening and closing ceremonies. The Coliseum played host to the California World Music Festival on April 7–8, 1979.

The Rolling Stones played at the stadium on their 1981 &quot;Tattoo You&quot; tour (October 9 and 11), supported by George Thorogood, the J. Geils Band, and Prince. Relatively unknown at the time, Prince was not well-received by fans and booed off the stage the first night. He did not intend to return for the second show until convinced by Stones frontman Mick Jagger to do so. The Stones played for 90,000 for each of 2 nights in 1981 and a record 90,000 fans for 4 nights in 1989.

The Argentina national soccer team played a friendly match against Mexico on May 14, 1985, as part of Argentina&#x27;s tour of North America prior to the 1986 FIFA World Cup that would be won by the squad managed by Carlos Bilardo. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concluded their Born in the U.S.A. Tour with four consecutive concerts on September 27, 29, 30, and October 2, 1985, in front of 82,000 people each night. These shows were recorded and eight songs from the show of September 30 appear on their box set &quot;Live 1975–85&quot;. The September 27 show was released through Springsteen&#x27;s website in 2019.

U2 played at the stadium during leg three of their breakout Joshua Tree tour on November 17 and 18, 1987. They later returned to the stadium for their PopMart Tour on June 21, 1997. Los Angeles natives Mötley Crüe played at the stadium on December 13, 1987, during the second leg of their Girls, Girls, Girls World Tour, with fellow Los Angeles band Guns N&#x27; Roses as the opening act. At that time, Mötley Crüe was one of the most popular and successful acts in the world, while Guns N&#x27; Roses was one of the largest up-and-coming acts. The latter would later return for four shows in October 1989 as the opening act for the Rolling Stones, then again on September 27, 1992, as part of their infamous co-headlining tour with Metallica.

The stadium played host to The Monsters of Rock Festival Tour, featuring Van Halen, Scorpions, Dokken, Metallica, and Kingdom Come, on July 24, 1988. A second show was planned to take place on July 23, but was later canceled. The stadium also played host to Amnesty International&#x27;s Human Rights Now! Benefit Concert on September 21, 1988, headlined by Sting and Peter Gabriel and also featuring Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Tracy Chapman, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, and Joan Baez.

====1990s–2000s====
The Raiders began looking to move out of the Coliseum as early as 1986. In addition to the delays in renovating the stadium, they never drew well; even after they won Super Bowl XVIII in 1984, they had trouble filling it. The NFL scheduled all of the Raiders&#x27; appearances on Monday Night Football as road games since the Los Angeles market would have been blacked out due to the Coliseum not being sold out. Finally, in 1995, the Raiders left Los Angeles and returned to Oakland, leaving the Coliseum without a professional football tenant for the first time since the close of World War II.

In the mid-1990s, the Coliseum was planned to be the home of the Los Angeles Blaze, a charter franchise of the United League (UL) which was planned to be a third league of Major League Baseball. In 2000, the Los Angeles Dragons of the Spring Football League used the Coliseum as their home stadium. The Legends Football League began as a halftime spectacular known as the Lingerie Bowl. The first three years (2004, 2005, 2006) were played at the Coliseum. From 2009 to 2011, a couple of Los Angeles Temptation games were played in the Coliseum. Beginning in 2015, the Temptation resumed playing at the Coliseum after three seasons at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario.

The 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer tournament was also held at the Coliseum. The United States national team beat Honduras in the final. The Coliseum also staged the final match of the Gold Cup in 1996, 1998 and 2000. In October 2000, the United States played its last match at the stadium in a friendly versus Mexico. Since then, the team has preferred the Rose Bowl Stadium and Dignity Health Sports Park as home stadiums in Greater Los Angeles. The stadium hosted the K-1 Dynamite!! USA mixed martial arts event. The promoters claimed that 54,000 people attended the event, which would have set a new attendance record for a mixed martial arts event in the United States; however, other officials estimated the crowd between 20,000 and 30,000.

In May 1959, the Dodgers had hosted an exhibition game against the reigning World Series champion New York Yankees at the Coliseum, a game which drew over 93,000 people. The Yankees won that game 6–2. As part of their West Coast 50th anniversary celebration in 2008, the Dodgers again hosted an exhibition game against the reigning World Series champions, the Boston Red Sox. On March 29, 2008, the middle game of a three-game set in Los Angeles was also won by the visitors by the relatively low score of 7–4, given the layout of the field; Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek had joked that he expected scores in the 80s.

As previously mentioned in the 1950s–1960s section, during 1958–1961, the distance from home plate to the left field foul pole was with a screen running across the close part of left field. Due to the intervening addition of another section of seating rimming the field, the 2008 grounds crew had much less space to work with, and the result was a left field foul line only , with a screen, which one Boston writer dubbed the &quot;Screen Monster&quot;. Even at that distance, is also short of the minimum legal home-run distance. This being an exhibition game, balls hit over the temporary screen were still counted as home runs. There were only a couple of home runs over the screen, as pitchers adjusted (and Manny Ramirez did not play).
A diagram () illustrated the differences in the dimensions between 1959 and 2008:

A sellout crowd of 115,300 was announced, which set a Guinness World Record for attendance at a baseball game, breaking the record set at a 1956 Summer Olympics baseball demonstration game between teams from the US and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

The Coliseum formerly hosted the major U.S. electronic dance music festival, the Electric Daisy Carnival. It last hosted the event in 2010; following the drug-related death of an underage attendee at EDC that year, the festival&#x27;s organizer Insomniac Events was blacklisted from hosting future events at the venue, and it subsequently moved to Las Vegas Motor Speedway in 2011. In 2003, select events of the X Games IX action sports event were held at the Coliseum. In 2010, the X Games XVI were held at the venue.

In 2006, the Coliseum Commission focused on signing a long-term lease with USC, who offered to purchase the facility from the state but was turned down. After some at-time contentious negotiations, with the university threatening to move to the Rose Bowl in late 2007, the two sides signed a 25-year lease in May 2008, giving the Coliseum Commission 8% of USC&#x27;s ticket sales, approximately $1.5 million a year, but committing the agency to a list of renovations. In 2006, Mexican band RBD held a concert during their U.S. tour before 70,000 people, with tickets sold out in less than 30 minutes. It was the highest attended event by a Mexican act since Los Bukis&#x27; 1993 and 1996 concerts.

On June 23, 2008, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission announced that they were putting the naming rights of the Coliseum on the market, predicting a deal valued at $6 million to $8 million a year. The funds would go towards financing over $100 million in renovations over the next decade, including a new video board, bathrooms, concession areas, and locker rooms. Additional seating was included in the renovation plans which increased the Coliseum&#x27;s seating capacity to 93,607 in September 2008.
On June 17, 2009, the Coliseum was the terminus for the Los Angeles Lakers&#x27; 2009 NBA championship victory parade. A crowd of over 90,000 attended the festivities, in addition to the throngs of supporters who lined the parade route. The Coliseum peristyle was redesigned in purple and gold regalia to commemorate the team, and the Lakers&#x27; court was transported from Staples Center to the Coliseum field to act as the stage. Past parades had ended at Staples Center, but due to the newly constructed L.A. Live complex, space was limited around the arena.

====2010s–present====

On July 30, 2011, the LA Rising festival with Rage Against the Machine, Muse, Rise Against, Lauryn Hill, Immortal Technique, and El Gran Silencio was hosted at the Coliseum. Roger Waters continued his The Wall Live at the stadium on 19 May 2012 to a sold-out crowd. On April 27, 2013, the stadium hosted a round of the Stadium Super Trucks off-road race.

On September 13, 2014, the Coliseum hosted the fifth-place game, third-place game and final of the 2014 Copa Centroamericana in front of 41,969 spectators. In August 2015, the Coliseum hosted the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games. On June 16, 2018, Shannon Briggs hosted the first press conference for a celebrity boxing event with KSI, Deji, Jake Paul, and Logan Paul.

On September 14, 2021, the NASCAR Cup Series announced that the annual Busch Clash would take place at the Coliseum, at a purpose-made quarter-mile track. On December 9, 2021, Kanye West performed a benefit concert for the long-imprisoned Larry Hoover with special guest Drake at the Coliseum. On September 23 and 24, 2022 German band Rammstein performed two shows as part of the North American leg of their Rammstein Stadium Tour

On December 10, 2022, Deadmau5 and Kaskade performed as their collaborative project Kx5 to a crowd of 50,000. Making it the largest ever one-day EDM headlining event in North America at the time.

====Return of the Los Angeles Rams 2016–19====
On January 12, 2016, the NFL gave permission for the St. Louis Rams to relocate back to Los Angeles. The Rams resumed play at the Coliseum while awaiting completion of SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.

On August 13, 2016, the Coliseum hosted its first NFL game at the stadium since 1994, as the Rams hosted the Dallas Cowboys at a preseason game in front of 89,140 people. On September 18, 2016, the Coliseum hosted the first Rams regular season home game since 1979, against the Seattle Seahawks following an impromptu pregame concert from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The Rams would boast a 9–3 victory over Seattle in front of a crowd of 91,046 in attendance.

On January 6, 2018, the Coliseum hosted its first Rams playoff game since the 1978 NFC Championship game, a 26–13 wild card round loss to the defending NFC champion Atlanta Falcons. On November 19, 2018, the Coliseum hosted its first &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game since 1985, with the Rams taking on the Kansas City Chiefs. That game, which was originally scheduled to be played at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City that night, was moved to the Coliseum due to poor field conditions at the former. The Rams won the game, 54–51 in the highest-scoring game in &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; history.

On January 12, 2019, the Coliseum hosted its most recent NFL playoff game, where the Rams defeated the Dallas Cowboys 30–22 in an NFC Divisional Playoff. The most recent Sunday Night Football game played at the Coliseum was on December 8, 2019, in which the Rams defeated the rival Seattle Seahawks 28–12 in front of a crowd of over 77,000 people.

On December 29, 2019, the Rams played their final game at the Coliseum, beating the Arizona Cardinals 31–24 before moving to SoFi Stadium in time for the 2020 NFL season. The Rams finished with a record of 16–14 playing their home games at the Coliseum in their second stint as tenants from 2016 through 2019. On February 16, 2022, three days after winning Super Bowl LVI, the Rams hosted their victory celebration before thousands of fans in front of the Coliseum&#x27;s peristyle end.

====2028 Summer Olympics====

Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics in 2028. During the 131st IOC Session, the International Olympic Committee officially awarded the 2028 Summer Olympics to Los Angeles on July 31, 2017. The Coliseum will be the first stadium to host events for three different Olympic games.

====NASCAR====

On February 6, 2022, NASCAR hosted a pre-season NASCAR Cup Series exhibition event. The temporary track marked the series&#x27; first race of any kind on a quarter-mile since 1971 and was won by Joey Logano. Martin Truex Jr. won the 2023 running of the event, followed by Denny Hamlin in 2024. The event was moved to Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 2025.

==Seating and attendance==
===Seating capacity (college football)===

===Attendance records===

==== 1963 Billy Graham Crusade ====
The largest gathering in the Coliseum&#x27;s history was a Billy Graham crusade on September 8, 1963, with 134,254 in attendance, noted by the Coliseum&#x27;s website as an all-time record. With the renovations of 1964, the capacity of the Coliseum was reduced to about 93,000 for future events.

====Sporting events====

;College football
Records differ between the 2006 USC football media guide and 2006 UCLA football media guide. (This may be due to only keeping records for &quot;home&quot; games until the 1950s.) The USC Media guide lists the top five record crowds as:
* 1. 104,953 — vs. Notre Dame 1947 (USC home game; Highest attendance for a football game in the Coliseum)
* 2. 103,303 — vs. UCLA 1939 (USC home game)
* 3. 103,000 — vs. USC 1945 (UCLA home game)
* 4. 102,548 — vs. USC 1954 (UCLA home game)
* 5. 102,050 — vs. UCLA 1947 (USC home game)

The UCLA Media guide does not list the 1939 game against USC, and only lists attendance for the second game in 1945 for Coliseum attendance records. These are the top three listed UCLA record Coliseum crowds:
* 1. 102,548 — vs. USC 1954 (UCLA home game)
* 2. 102,050 — vs. USC 1947 (UCLA home game)
* 3. 100,333 — vs. USC 1945 (USC home game; 1945&#x27;s second of two meetings)
The largest crowd to attend a USC football game against an opponent other than UCLA or Notre Dame was 96,130 for a November 10, 1951, contest
with Stanford University. The largest attendance for a UCLA contest against a school other than USC was 92,962 for the November 1, 1946, game with Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California.

;National Football League
The Los Angeles Rams played the San Francisco 49ers before an NFL record attendance of 102,368 on November 10, 1957. This was a record paid attendance that stood until September 2009 at Cowboys Stadium, though the overall NFL regular season record was broken in a 2005 regular season game between the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Both records were broken on September 20, 2009, at the first regular season game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants.

In 1958 the Rams averaged 83,680 for their six home games, including 100,470 for the Chicago Bears and 100,202 for the Baltimore Colts. In their 13 seasons in Los Angeles the Raiders on several occasions drew near-capacity crowds to the Coliseum. The largest were 91,505 for an October 25, 1992, game with the Dallas Cowboys, 91,494 for a September 29, 1991, contest with the San Francisco 49ers, and 90,380 on January 1, 1984, for a playoff game with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Coliseum hosted the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game, later called the Super Bowl. The January 15, 1967, game, pitting the Green Bay Packers against the Kansas City Chiefs, attracted 61,946 fans—a lower-than anticipated crowd (by comparison, a regular-season game between the Packers and Rams a month earlier drew 72,418). For Super Bowl VII in 1973, which matched the Miami Dolphins against the Washington Redskins, the attendance was a near-capacity 90,182, a record that would stand until Super Bowl XI at the Rose Bowl. The 1975 NFC Championship Game between the Los Angeles Rams and Dallas Cowboys had an attendance of 88,919, the highest for an NFC Championship Game. The 1983 AFC Championship Game between the Raiders and Seattle Seahawks then attracted 91,445, still the largest crowd for a conference championship game since the conference-title format began with the 1970 season.

The Rams&#x27; first NFL game at the Coliseum since 1979, after spending fifteen years at Anaheim Stadium and then twenty-one seasons in St. Louis, a pre-season contest against the Cowboys on August 13, 2016, drew a crowd of 89,140. The team&#x27;s first regular-season home game, on September 18 against the Seattle Seahawks, attracted 91,046—the largest attendance for a Rams game at the Coliseum since 1974.

;Major League Baseball
Contemporary baseball guides listed the theoretical baseball seating capacity as 92,500. Thousands of east-end seats were very far from home plate, and were not sold unless needed. The largest regular season attendance was 78,672, the Dodgers&#x27; home debut in the Coliseum, against the San Francisco Giants on April 18, 1958. The May 7, 1959, exhibition game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the 1958 World Series Champion New York Yankees, in honor of disabled former Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella, drew 93,103, which was a Major League Baseball record prior to 2008.

All three Dodgers home games in the 1959 World Series with the Chicago White Sox exceeded 90,000 attendance. Game 5 drew 92,706 fans, a major league record for a non-exhibition game. The attendance for the exhibition game on March 29, 2008, between the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers, was 115,300, setting a new Guinness World Record for attendance at a baseball game. The previous record of an estimated 114,000 was in the 1956 Summer Olympics at Melbourne Cricket Ground for an exhibition game between teams from branches of American Military Forces and Australia.

;Soccer

The first official soccer match at the Coliseum was an international fixture between the United States and Mexico that took place on March 7, 1965, as part of regional World Cup qualification. The teams drew 2–2 in front of 22,570 spectators.

Although the stadium represents the second most active venue in the history of the US national team (after Robert F. Kennedy), the USMNT has only played 22 matches in the Coliseum, the most recent in 2000. Of these, 11 were in official competition (three from World Cup qualifiers, seven from the CONCACAF Gold Cup and one from the North American Nations Cup) and 11 friendlies, all category &quot;A&quot;. The team won their first absolute title by finishing as champion of the 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup, defeating their counterpart from Honduras on penalties.

However, the most active national team at the Memorial Coliseum is Mexico, which has played 86 matches in the building: 14 in official competition (3 in the World Cup qualifying round, 9 in the Gold Cup and two from the North American Nations Cup), including the Gold Cup finals from 1996 and 1998, in which they won 2–0 against Brasil and 1–0 against United States respectively; and 72 friendlies (50 of Category &quot;A&quot; – against other senior teams – 6 of the so-called &quot;B&quot; selection and 16 against both Mexican and foreign clubs). LA Memorial Coliseum is the second most used venue by the Mexican national team, after only the team&#x27;s official headquarters at Estadio Azteca. The stadium hosted the Los Angeles Wolves during the inaugural season of the United Soccer Association in 1967, which culminated in the final championship at the Coliseum. The Los Angeles Toros of the National Professional Soccer League also played at the Coliseum in 1967, but were moved to San Diego the following season before folding. The Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer League played at the Coliseum in 1977 and 1981 between stints at the Rose Bowl.

==Sculpture and commemorations==
A pair of life-sized bronze nude statues of male and female athletes atop a post-and-lintel frame formed the &quot;Olympic Gateway&quot; created by Robert Graham for the 1984 games. The statues, modeled on water polo player Terry Schroeder and several women [Jane Frederick of Santa Barbara, an Olympic pentathlete who did not qualify for the games] and a
long jumper from Guyana, Jennifer Inniss, who participated in the games, were noted for their anatomical accuracy. A decorative facade bearing the Olympic rings was erected in front of the peristyle for the 1984 games, and the structure remained in place through that year&#x27;s football season. The stadium rim and tunnels were repainted in alternating pastel colors that were part of architect Jon Jerde&#x27;s graphic design for the games; these colors remained until 1987.

===Coliseum Cauldron===

The Coliseum Cauldron was built for the 1932 Summer Olympics and was also reused during the 1984 Summer Olympics.
The cauldron is a main sight on stadium and is still present in the Stadium. It is lit during special events (such as the period when an edition of the Olympic Games are being held in another city or in mourning for some personality related to the city). As the stadium was the main venue on the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games the cauldron was relit by Rafer Johnson during the opening ceremonies and extinguished during the closing ceremony.

In addition, the torch has been lit on the following historic occasions:
* To honor the memory of Israeli athletes killed during the terrorist attack during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich
* For several days following the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986

In 2022, George Brown College was ranked among the top 10 research colleges in the country, ranking 8th for overall research income, and ranking 4th for both the number of paid students and for the number of completed projects. Research Infosource, which publishes annual rankings reports on research and development at institutions across Canada, released the results for the top 50 colleges in January 2022.

==History==
The college was established during the formation of Ontario&#x27;s community college system in 1967. Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology were established on May 21, 1965. The college is named after George Brown, who was an important 19th-century politician and newspaper publisher (he founded the &quot;Toronto Globe&quot;, forerunner to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;) and was one of the Fathers of Confederation.

The college&#x27;s predecessor, the Provincial Institute of Trades (PIT), was founded in 1951 to offer apprentice training on behalf of the provincial Department of Labour. In 1952, the PIT began operation at 21 Nassau Street in Toronto&#x27;s Kensington Market and, after expanding with the construction of two additional buildings on the site, was offering programs in lathing and structural steel, barbering, diesel mechanics, jewellery arts, watchmaking and welding by 1961. In 1962 the province opened the Provincial Institute of Trades and Occupations (PITO), a sister training institute, at 555 Davenport Road near Casa Loma.

When George Brown College was formed in 1967, it absorbed both the PIT and PITO and opened its Kensington and Casa Loma campuses at the two institutes&#x27; former facilities. George Brown College also went on to absorb, in 1969, four former Toronto Board of Education Adult Education Centres in a third campus at 507 College Street and, in 1973, five Toronto-area Schools of Nursing in 1973, including: St. Joseph&#x27;s, St. Michael&#x27;s, Toronto General, Atkinson (Toronto Western) and Nightingale.

In 1973, a new expanded Casa Loma campus was opened. In 1976, the St. James Campus opened at 200 King Street East in buildings formerly belonging to Christie Bakery and Hallmark Cards.

The Hospitality building (300 Adelaide E.) opened at St. James Campus in 1987, the same year that the College Street Campus closed. Kensington Campus closed in 1994.

* Frank Sorochinsky 1994 - 2004
* John Rankin 1991 - 1995

==Casa Loma campus==

Casa Loma campus is situated on the stretch of Kendal Ave. between Davenport Rd. and MacPherson Ave. Nearby features include Casa Loma, and the City of Toronto Archives. The campus itself is a collection of five buildings.
In 2004, the old and mostly unused A building was torn down due to health concerns and to create a green space on campus. Students attending classes in building A were experiencing illness, thought to be due to sick building syndrome. There is a moose sculpture stood in the green space until 2012 or 2013.

==St. James campus==


St. James campus consists of five buildings. The first is a large brick building at 200 King St. E. The second and third are located at 290 and 300 Adelaide St. East and are connected. They are home to Financial services, Creative Arts, Business Administration and the faculty of Centre for Hospitality and Culinary Arts. This campus is where the chef school is located.
==Waterfront campus==
In September 2012, George Brown opened the Waterfront Campus located at 51 Dockside Dr., south of Queen&#x27;s Quay between Jarvis and Parliament Streets (between Corus Quay and Redpath Sugar Refinery). This campus is home to the Centre for Health Sciences. In 2019, the college expanded its Waterfront Campus to the Daniels Waterfront - City of the Arts complex at 3 Lower Jarvis St. - home to the School of Design. And the latest Waterfront Campus expansion, Limberlost Place, is set to open at 185 Queens Quay E. in 2025. The 10-storey tall-wood, mass-timber building will be the first institutional building of its kind in Ontario and will house the School of Architectural Studies and the School of Computer Technology. It will also house a research institute and a child care centre.

==Toronto Metropolitan University campus==

This associate campus is in the Sally Horsfall Eaton building (SHE building) at Toronto Metropolitan University. The address is 99 Gerrard St. E.

George Brown also has classes from the Early Childhood Education, Early Childhood Assistant and Activation Coordinator Gerontology programs at the Sally Horsfall Eaton (SHE) Building at TMU (located at the corner of Gould St and Mutual St.).

==Young Centre for the Performing Arts==

The Theatre School at George Brown College presents a season of productions at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts in the Distillery District in downtown Toronto.
It is a brand-new theatre built into 1800s-era Victorian industrial buildings, with the incorporation of additional teaching facilities.
The theatre arts program enjoys a partnership with the Tarragon Theatre and Soulpepper Theatre Company.

==Student Residence, The George==
George Brown’s student residence, The George, opened in 2016. Located at 80 Cooperage St. E., near Cherry and Front streets, close to Toronto’s Distillery District, the building was part of the 2015 Pan Am/Para Pan Am Games Athletes Village before George Brown took ownership. 

The building also houses the Lucie and Thornton Blackburn Conference Centre. The facility is named after a wife and husband who escaped slavery and established Toronto’s first cab company, helped found the Little Trinity Anglican Church and worked on anti-slavery initiatives. Their story is told in a student-created mural at the conference centre.  

==Sports==
The school&#x27;s team name is the Huskies, and varsity sports include:
* Badminton 
* Baseball
* Basketball 
* Cross Country
* Esports
* Indoor Soccer
* Soccer
* Volleyball

The volleyball team has been coached by, among others, Olympian Sam Schachter.

==Student newspaper==
&quot;The Dialog&quot; is a student newspaper at George Brown College and a member of Canadian University Press. It is owned and operated by the Student Association of George Brown College. Founded in 1974, &quot;The Dialog&quot; serves students on three downtown campuses and several satellite campuses as a bi-weekly paper focusing on news within the college. It is printed in tabloid format. The previous newspapers at George Brown College include &quot;The Globe&quot; (1967–71) and &quot;George Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; (1971–73).

Marek Borowski is an MP from Piła, but in the September 2005 parliamentary elections he contested a seat in Warsaw. Borowski was the Social Democratic presidential candidate in the 2005 Polish presidential elections. Just as his party received a massive defeat in the September 2005 Parliamentary elections, Borowski lost the presidential elections, receiving 10% of the vote and fourth place, despite Aleksander Kwaśniewski&#x27;s support following the withdrawal of Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz.

He most recently ran (unsuccessfully) for the office of mayor of Warsaw in the 2010 local elections.

<text>The Hedgehog (also known as an &quot;Anti-Submarine Projector&quot;) was a forward-throwing anti-submarine weapon that was used primarily during the Second World War. The device, which was developed by the Royal Navy, fired up to 24 spigot mortars ahead of a ship when attacking a U-boat. It was deployed on convoy escort warships such as destroyers and corvettes to supplement the depth charges.

As the mortar projectiles employed contact fuzes rather than time or bathymetric (depth) fuzes, detonation occurred directly against a hard surface such as the hull of a submarine making it more deadly than depth charges, which relied on damage caused by hydrostatic shockwaves. During World War II out of 5,174 British depth charge attacks there were 85.5 kills, a ratio of 60.5 to 1. In comparison, the Hedgehog made 268 attacks for 47 kills, a ratio of 5.7 to 1.

==Development==
The &quot;Hedgehog&quot;, so named because the empty rows of its launcher spigots resembled the spines on the back of a hedgehog, was a replacement for the unsuccessful Fairlie Mortar that was secretly tested aboard in 1941. The Fairlie was designed to fire depth charges ahead of a ship when attacking a submarine. The principle of firing projectiles forwards, instead of dropping depth charges over the stern, was considered viable, despite the failure of the Fairlie. This research by the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (DMWD) led to the development of the Hedgehog.

The weapon was a multiple &#x27;spigot mortar&#x27; or spigot discharger, a type of weapon developed between the wars by Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker, RA. The spigot mortar was based on early infantry trench mortars. The spigot design allowed a single device to fire warheads of different sizes. The propelling charge was part of the main weapon and worked against a rod (the spigot) set in the baseplate which fitted inside a tubular tail of the &#x27;bomb&#x27;. This principle was first used on the Blacker Bombard Spigot Mortar and the later PIAT anti-tank weapon.

The adaptation of the bombard for naval use was made in partnership with MIR(c) under Major Millis Jefferis, who had taken Blacker&#x27;s design and brought it into use with the Army. The weapon fires a salvo of 24 bombs in an arc, aimed to land in a circular or elliptical area about in diameter at a fixed point about directly ahead of the attacking ship. The mounting initially was fixed, but was later replaced by a gyro-stabilised one to allow for the rolling and pitching of the attacking ship.

The system was developed to solve the problem of the target submarine disappearing from the attacking ship&#x27;s ASDIC when closer than the sonar&#x27;s minimum range. The speed of sound in water was such that the time taken for the &#x27;ping&#x27; echo to return to the attacking ship from a close by target submarine became too short to allow the human operator to distinguish the returning audible echo from the initial sound pulse emitted by the sonar – the so-called &quot;instantaneous echo&quot;, where the output sound pulse and returning echo merge, with the submarine still out of depth charge range. A submarine in this &quot;blind spot&quot; became effectively invisible to the sonar, allowing it to make evasive manoeuvres undetected. The solution was a weapon mounted on the foredeck that discharged the projectiles up and over the ship&#x27;s bow while the submarine was still detectable by the sonar, entering the water some distance in front of the ship.

==History==
The Hedgehog entered service in 1942. Carrying a Torpex charge, each mortar projectile had a diameter of and weighed about . The spigots were angled so the projectiles would land in a circular pattern with a diameter of , about ahead of the ship&#x27;s position. The projectiles would then sink at about . They would reach a submerged U-boat, for example at in under 9 seconds. Sympathetic detonation of projectiles near those contacting hard surfaces was a possibility, but the number of explosions counted was usually fewer than the number of projectiles launched.

The prototype launcher was tested aboard in 1941, but there were no submarine kills until November 1942, after it had been installed aboard one hundred ships. Initial success rates, of about 5%, were only slightly better than depth charges. Swells and spray frequently covered the launcher during heavy North Atlantic weather, and subsequent attempts to launch from the soaked launcher were often hindered by firing circuit problems, launching an incomplete pattern. A depth charge total miss would still produce an explosion, leading crews to think that they might have damaged their target or at least demoralised its personnel; a Hedgehog miss was discouragingly quiet. The Royal Navy launched Hedgehog so seldom in early 1943 that a directive was issued ordering captains of ships equipped with Hedgehog to report why they had &quot;not&quot; used Hedgehog on an underwater contact. The results were blamed on crew inexperience and low confidence in the weapon. However, after an officer from the DMWD was sent to the base at Londonderry, where the escort vessels were based, with better training and shipwide talks on examples of successful Hedgehog attacks, the kill rate improved considerably. By the end of the war, statistics showed that on average, one in every five attacks made by Hedgehog resulted in a kill (compared with fewer than one in eighty with depth charges).

In response to this new deadly threat to its U-boats, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; brought forward its programme of acoustic torpedoes in 1943, beginning with the &quot;Falke&quot;. These new &quot;homing&quot; acoustic torpedoes could be employed effectively without the use of a periscope, providing submarines a better chance to remain undetected and evade counterattack.

In the Pacific Theatre, sank six Japanese submarines in a two-week period with the Hedgehog in May 1944.

In 1946, the destroyer escort was destroyed while unloading ammunition when a crewman accidentally dropped a Hedgehog charge near one of her main turret ammunition rooms, triggering three devastating explosions that wrecked the superstructure.

==Operational usage==
The launcher had four &quot;cradles&quot;, each with six launcher spigots. The firing sequence was staggered so all the bombs would land at about the same time. This had the added advantage of minimising the stress on the weapon&#x27;s mounting so that deck reinforcement was not needed, allowing the weapon to be easily retrofitted at any convenient place on a ship. Reloading took about three minutes.

The Hedgehog had four key advantages over the depth charge:

# An unsuccessful attack does not hide the submarine from sonar.
#: When a depth charge explodes, it can take 15 minutes before the disturbance can settle down enough that sonar becomes effective. Many submarines escaped during the time after an unsuccessful depth charge attack. Since Hedgehog charges explode only on contact, sonar tracking of the submarine is less likely to be disrupted by an unsuccessful Hedgehog attack.
# Proximity weapons (such as depth charges) need to be set for the target&#x27;s correct depth to be effective. Contact-fuzed charges do not have that limitation, and an explosion at the time predicted for the contact-fuzed projectile to reach the target depth may indicate a &quot;hit&quot;.
#: However, although knowledge of target depth was less important, the Hedgehog was less successful against deep targets. Doctrine based on combat experience discouraged use on targets deeper than .
# There is no &quot;blind period&quot; allowing the submarine to escape undetected.
#: Until depth-finding sonar became available (the first was the Royal Navy&#x27;s Q attachment in 1943), there was a &quot;dead period&quot; during the final moments before a depth-charge attack began when contact with the target would be lost. U-boat commanders became adept at sharp course changes and direction speed at these moments to break contact and escape. Hedgehog remained usable while the submarine was detectable by sonar giving it no time to take evasive actions.
# A direct hit by a single Hedgehog bomb was usually sufficient to sink a U Boat.
#: Many depth charges were required to inflict enough cumulative damage to sink a U Boat; even then, many survived hundreds of detonations over a period of many hours. For example, survived 678 depth charges dropped against it in April 1945. The effectiveness of the depth charge was reduced because they detonated at a set depth at a distance away from the submarine, the explosive shock was rapidly dissipated by a cushion of water between it and the target. In contrast the Hedgehog charge exploded in direct contact with the hull. However, misses with the Hedgehog were silent and did not cause any damage unlike the cumulative damage caused by depth charging; nor did it have the same psychological effect as a depth charge attack.

==Derivatives and successors==
In late 1943 the Royal Navy introduced Squid. This was a three-tubed mortar that launched depth charges. Initially it was used as a single weapon, but when this failed to be successful, it was upgraded to the &quot;double squid&quot; that consisted of two launchers placed in parallel. In 1955 this system was upgraded to the three-barrelled Limbo that launched Minol charges.

The United States produced a rocket version of Hedgehog called Mousetrap, then Weapon Alpha as a replacement for both. Still, Hedgehog remained in service with the United States Navy into the Cold War until both Hedgehog and the less satisfactory Weapon Alpha were replaced by ASROC.

Three &quot;Hedgerow&quot; flotillas of specialized Landing Craft Assault boats carrying the Hedgehog instead of troops were used during the Normandy landings. An addition of impact fuse extensions in the projectile noses enabled detonating the warheads above ground. The bombs were used to clear 100-yard-wide paths through mines and barbed wire obstacles on the beach.

The Australian Army adapted the marine Hedgehog into a land-based seven-shot launcher that could be mounted on the back of Matilda tanks.

In 1949, a copy of Hedgehog was created in the USSR called the MBU-200, which was then developed in 1956 into the MBU-600 with an increased range of .

Weapons derived from the Hedgehog have been largely phased out from Western navies in favor of homing torpedoes, and in Russia and allied states like India by anti-submarine rocket launchers like the RBU-6000.

<text>Józef Oleksy (; 22 June 1946 – 9 January 2015) was a Polish left-wing politician who served as Prime Minister of Poland from 7 March 1995 to 7 February 1996, when he resigned due to espionage allegations. He was chairman of the Democratic Left Alliance (&quot;Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej&quot;, SLD).

==Early life and education==
In his youth he lived in Nowy Sącz, and was an altar boy at St. Margaret church. He graduated from Kazimierz Brodziński High School in Tarnów. Later on, he graduated from the Faculty of Foreign Trade of the Warsaw School of Planning and Statistics (currently SGH Warsaw School of Economics). He obtained a doctoral degree in economics. He was a dean and lecturer at the Faculty of International Relations at the SGH Warsaw School of Economics and the Vistula University in Warsaw.

==Career==

From 1968 to 1990 he was a member of the communist Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR). 
He was a member of the board of the main Socialist Union of Polish Students. He chaired the National Council of Young Scientists. He was the secretary of the PZPR University Committee at the Warsaw School of Planning and Statistics. In 1977 he went to work in party apparatus at the Department of Ideological and Educational Work of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party. From 1981 to the X Congress of the Party, he headed the office of the Central Committee of the Party. In 1987-1989 he was the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee in Biala Podlaska. In 1989, he served as Minister-Council member for cooperation with trade unions. In the same year he took part in the round table talks on the government side. Oleksy represented the Communist leadership in round table talks with the opposition Solidarity movement in early 1989.

In 1990 he was one of the founders of the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland, he was the chairman of this party from 28 January 1996 to 6 December 1997, and co-founded the Democratic Left Alliance in 1999. In the years 1989–2005, he was the member of the Sejm.

In the years 1993-1995 he was the Marshal of the Sejm. From 7 March 1995 to 7 February 1996, he served as Prime Minister of Poland. He resigned after being accused by Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski for spying for Russia under the pseudonym &quot;Olin&quot;. These allegations have never been confirmed.

In the years 2001-2005 he was a chairman of the European Union Committee in the Sejm which was responsible for aligning all Polish laws and regulations before Poland joined European Union in 2004. In 2004 he was a member of the European Parliament and the Convention on the Future of Europe, which was responsible to produce a draft constitution for the European Union for the European Council to finalise and adopt.

In early 2004 he took the office of the Minister of Internal Affairs. Between 21 April 2004 and 5 January 2005 he was the Marshal of the Sejm.

A record of a private conversation Jozef Oleksy had with one of Poland&#x27;s richest businessmen Aleksander Gudzowaty &quot;leaked&quot; to the media on 22 March 2007. The tapes suggested corruption in the SLD party. Oleksy accused former president Aleksander Kwaśniewski of illegal financial procedures, and spoke very harshly of then SLD leader Wojciech Olejniczak and several other members of the party. He soon left the SLD.
He re-joined the SLD on 1 February 2010 and on 12 May 2012 he became vice-president of this party.

==Private life==

Józef Oleksy was married to Maria Oleksy. He had two children.

Since 2005 he had been struggling with cancer. He died on 9 January 2015. Funeral ceremonies with representatives of the state authorities, including President Bronisław Komorowski, Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz and Marshal of the Sejm Radosław Sikorski, took place on 16 January 2015 in the Field Cathedral of the Polish Army in Warsaw. Józef Oleksy was buried at the Powązki Military Cemetery.

<text>Hetton-le-Hole is a town and civil parish in the City of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England. It is in the historic county of Durham. A182 runs through the town, between Houghton-le-Spring and Easington Lane (the latter borders the County Durham District), off the A690 and close to the A1(M).

The parish, which includes the villages of Easington Lane and Warden Law, had a population of 14,402 in 2001 . The parish also includes Hetton proper, along with East Rainton, Middle Rainton (West Rainton is a separate parish), Low Moorsley and High Moorsley.

Great Eppleton Wind Farm, a wind farm originally of four dual-bladed alternators, provides electricity to the National Grid. The original wind turbines have been replaced by larger three-bladed versions. The turbines are far enough away from local houses not to cause any audible disturbance.

==History==
The history of the Hetton area can be traced back for up to a thousand years. The name of Hetton-le-Hole derives from two Anglo-Saxon words which were spelt together &quot;Heppedune&quot;, meaning Bramble Hill. The name was adopted by a local landowning family, the le Hepdons, who owned part of the Manor. The ancient manor, which was bounded by that of Elemore, was divided into two parts known as Hetton-on-the-Hill and Hetton-in-the-Hole. The latter, a more sheltered vicinity, was where the village arose. Records exist of the many holders of the manor back to the 14th century. William de Hepdon held half the Manor by deed in 1363 and in 1380 William de Dalden held the other half. Even earlier charters go back to 1187 and mention the early village of Heppedune, its people, houses, crofts, oxgangs and strips of land for the villagers in the three great fields around the settlement. In 1187 Bertram de Heppedune held the manor for the King; other de Hepdons were his descendants.

===Coal mining===
By 1896, Hetton-le-Hole was a mining village in its own right; the district parish of Eppleton had been formed from Hetton-le-Hole which, by then, included that part of Hetton-le-Hole known as the &quot;Downs&quot;. The village &quot;comprised an area of 512 acres, with a population of 5,000&quot;.

Coal has been mined in the surrounding area since Roman times. Coal was then obtained by drift mining, but by the 14th century shafts were used. In 1819 the Hetton Coal Company was formed and its first shaft was sunk a year later. It was a highly controversial undertaking, with geologists doubtful as to whether coal of any value existed there. The Hetton Coal Company&#x27;s owners also decided to build a wagonway from their new Hetton colliery to the River Wear at Sunderland. George Stephenson was hired to build the line. The trains were powered by gravity down the inclines and by locomotives for its level and upward stretches. It was the first railway to use no animal power at all. These methods were used until 1959, as was some of the original machinery.

This was the scene of one of the earliest fatalities on railway lines, the &quot;Hetton Wagonway Disaster&quot; of Saturday 26 February 1831. Two Primitive Methodist Ministers were walking along the wagonway to Hetton when they saw some wagons approaching on the line on which they were walking. They moved to the adjacent line but had not seen wagons approaching from the other direction. John Hewson was killed outright, John Branfoot died a few hours later.

These activities led to a rapid increase in the size of Hetton and over 200 houses for the miners were built at once. These have all but gone now, but twelve of these former mining cottages from Francis Street in the Hetton Downs area of the town were re-erected stone by stone at Beamish Open Air Museum, Stanley, near Chester-le-Street. The UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–1985) brought about hardship for many of the workers. Two local unsigned bands (The Pigeon Fanciers and Haswell Crisis) recorded and released a single to raise money for the families and to recognise the contribution made by miners over the years in their locality. Their adapted version of a Bob Dylan classic failed to chart, but the project made a slight profit as local support from other mining communities ensured that &#x27;Knocking on Hetton&#x27;s Floor&#x27; sold more than 1000 copies.

Hetton Colliery closed in 1950, Elemore Colliery closed in 1974 and Eppleton Colliery closed in 1986. Today, nothing exists of the mines in Hetton; the former mine complexes have disappeared and spoil tips have been removed, although some remain in nearby Haswell. The area surrounding Hetton Colliery has been landscaped and is now occupied by a lake and leisure facilities. Eppleton Colliery has been landscaped, and all that remains is the Hetton Centre (the former Colliery Welfare building) and the Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground which hosts the home games of Sunderland A.F.C. Women and Sunderland U23s. There is also a quarry where sand is mined. This is now undergoing a reformation; around 15% of it has been smoothed and grassed over.

The decommissioned St Nicholas&#x27; Church in Front Street was destroyed by fire in November 2006. It is unknown if arson was the cause. It had previously been listed due to its architectural significance.

=== Civil parish ===
Hetton le Hole became a civil parish in 1866, on 1 April 1937 the parish of &quot;Hetton le Hole&quot; was abolished and merged with East Rainton, Great Eppleton, Little Eppleton, Moorsley and Pittington to form a parish called simply &quot;Hetton&quot;. In 1931 the parish of &quot;Hetton le Hole&quot; had a population of 17,665.

<doc id="637467" wikidata="Q6780964" url="?curid=637467" title="Mary Williamson Harriman">
<text>Mary Williamson Averell Harriman (July 22, 1851 – November 7, 1932) was an American philanthropist and the wife of railroad executive E. H. Harriman. Born in New York to a successful family, Averell married Harriman in 1879. Averell&#x27;s father introduced Harriman to the railroad business. After Harriman&#x27;s death, his wife was left with between $70 and $100 million. She became dedicated to philanthropy, donating the land that became Harriman State Park and largely funding the development of the controversial Eugenics Record Office. Averell had several children; her son, W. Averell Harriman became governor of New York and her daughter Mary Harriman Rumsey founded the Junior League.

==Early life==
Mary Williamson Averell was born on July 22, 1851, in New York City. She was tutored at home and completed her education at a finishing school with the &quot;expectation that one day she would become a fine wife and mother for some young man of equal or greater social standing than the Averells.&quot; Mary&#x27;s father, William J. Averell, was a successful New York banker and president of the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad.

==Adulthood==

In Averell&#x27;s late twenties, she met 31-year-old Edward Henry Harriman, a rising stockbroker and businessman, whom she married on August 10, 1879 . After her marriage, her father offered her husband a seat on his railroad&#x27;s board, which led to a career in railroads and an extraordinary fortune. In 1886, that fortune allowed E. H. to purchase of heavily forested land on the western shore of the Hudson River at Highland Falls in New York; this was expanded to within two years by the purchase of 40 additional properties. The estate, named Arden, came to include dairying, horse breeding and mining. As one of his neighbors put it, &quot;He collects mountains as other men collect china.&quot;

By the start of the 20th century, lumbering and quarries were beginning to encroach on the tranquility of the region. When, in 1909, the state of New York acquired a parcel of land at Bear Mountain to build a new prison, Harriman approached New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes with a proposal to extend the Palisades Interstate Park with a donation of thousands of acres and one million dollars as an endowment for its management if the governor would agree to locate the prison somewhere else. In September 1909, E.H. Harriman died, but the offer was ultimately accepted, and Mary and her son Averell completed the gift.

==Later life and philanthropy==

After her husband&#x27;s death in 1909, Harriman continued to manage her considerable empire, valued between $70 and $100 million (). As one commentator noted, her &quot;lifelong interest in philanthropy was about to become a profession.&quot; One of her first undertakings was to fulfill E.H.&#x27;s vision of an immense state park. In 1910, Mary donated of the Arden estate to the State of New York, leading to the creation of Harriman State Park as an extension of the Palisades Interstate Park, along with the $1 million () dollar endowment for its management. She made it conditional upon others contributing $1.5 million () and the State of New York matching these funds with an added $2.5 million (). She received the National Institute of Social Sciences Gold Medal in 1925 and the Pugsley Gold Medal in 1929 &quot;...for her services in the establishment of the Palisades Interstate Park.&quot;

This was to be the start of a life dedicated to philanthropy. Monies were contributed to The Boys&#x27; Club of New York that E.H. loved and supported, to the American Red Cross, to John Muir to help save the Yosemite Valley and to Yale University for an endowed chair of Forestry. She also supported a number of artists, including especially sculptor Malvina Hoffman, whose bust of Harriman is still on display in Arden House.

In her married years Harriman was a strong, silent, and supportive wife. After her husband&#x27;s death, she became a leader in American philanthropy, donating her personal and private resources to improve the world around her. But many today would regard it as a serious blot on her reputation that she gave over a half-million dollars to the Eugenics Record Office, upon the encouragement of her friend David Starr Jordan. In 1913, she created the E. H. Harriman Award in her late husband&#x27;s honor to recognize outstanding achievements in railway safety; the award is still presented on an annual basis today.

==Personal life==
The Harrimans had six children:

*Mary Harriman (1881–1934), who in 1901, as a 19-year-old New York City debutante, formed the Junior League. Mary married Charles Cary Rumsey (1879–1922), sculptor and polo player
*Henry Neilson Harriman (b. 1883)
*Cornelia Harriman (1884–1966)
*Carol Harriman (b. 1889) 
*William Averell Harriman (1891–1986), who in 1955 became the Governor of New York. He married Kitty Lanier Lawrence, then Marie Norton Whitney, and lastly to Pamela Beryl Digby Churchill Hayward
*Edward Roland Noel Harriman (1895–1978), who married Gladys Fries (1896–1983)

Mary W. Harriman died on November 7, 1932, in Manhattan, New York.

<text>Charles Leslie Stevenson (June 27, 1908 – March 14, 1979) was an American analytic philosopher best known for his work in ethics and aesthetics.

==Biography==
Stevenson was born on June 27, 1908, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was educated at Yale, receiving in 1930 a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in English literature, at Jesus College, Cambridge, where in 1933 he was awarded a BA degree in moral sciences (philosophy), and at Harvard, getting his Doctor of Philosophy degree there in 1935. While at Cambridge he studied under Ludwig Wittgenstein and G. E. Moore. He was an instructor at Yale University from 1939 to 1944, spending some of that time teaching mathematics to wartime naval recruits. His post was not renewed in 1944 because the department did not approve of his emotivist views. After a period on a Guggenheim fellowship at Berkeley, Pomona, and Chicago, he was appointed to the University of Michigan where he taught from 1946 to 1977. Among his students was Joel Feinberg.

He gave the most sophisticated defense of emotivism in the post-war period. In his papers &quot;The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms&quot; (1937) and &quot;Persuasive Definitions&quot; (1938), and his book &quot;Ethics and Language&quot; (1944), he developed a theory of emotive meaning; which he then used to provide a foundation for his theory of a persuasive definition. He furthermore advanced emotivism as a meta-ethical theory that sharply delineated between cognitive, scientific uses of language (used to state facts and to give reasons, and subject to the laws of science) and non-cognitive uses (used to state feelings and exercise influence).

Stevenson died on March 14, 1979, in Bennington, Vermont.

==Contributions to philosophy==
Stevenson&#x27;s work has been seen both as an elaboration upon A. J. Ayer&#x27;s views and as a representation of one of &quot;two broad types of ethical emotivism.&quot; An analytic philosopher, Stevenson suggested in his 1937 essay &quot;The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms&quot; that any ethical theory should explain three things: that intelligent disagreement can occur over moral questions, that moral terms like &quot;good&quot; are &quot;magnetic&quot; in encouraging action, and that the scientific method is insufficient for verifying moral claims. Stevenson&#x27;s own theory was fully developed in his 1944 book &quot;Ethics and Language&quot;. In it, he agrees with Ayer that ethical sentences express the speaker&#x27;s feelings, but he adds that they also have an &quot;imperative&quot; component intended to change the listener&#x27;s feelings and that this component is of greater importance. Where Ayer spoke of &quot;values&quot;, or fundamental psychological inclinations, Stevenson speaks of &quot;attitudes&quot;, and where Ayer spoke of disagreement of &quot;fact&quot;, or rational disputes over the application of certain values to a particular case, Stevenson speaks of differences in &quot;belief&quot;; the concepts are the same. Terminology aside, Stevenson interprets ethical statements according to two patterns of analysis.

===First pattern analysis===
Under his first pattern of analysis, an ethical statement has two parts: a declaration of the speaker&#x27;s attitude and an imperative to mirror it, so &quot;&#x27;This is good&#x27; means &quot;I approve of this; do so as well.&quot;&quot; The first half of the sentence is a proposition, but the imperative half is not, so Stevenson&#x27;s translation of an ethical sentence remains a noncognitive one.

Imperatives cannot be &quot;proved&quot;, but they can still be &quot;supported&quot; so that the listener understands that they are not wholly arbitrary:

The purpose of these supports is to make the listener understand the consequences of the action they are being commanded to do. Once they understand the command&#x27;s consequences, they can determine whether or not obedience to the command will have desirable results.

===Second pattern analysis===
Stevenson&#x27;s second pattern of analysis is used for statements about &quot;types&quot; of actions, not specific actions. Under this pattern,

In second-pattern analysis, rather than judge an action directly, the speaker is evaluating it according to a general principle. For instance, someone who says &quot;Murder is wrong&quot; might mean &quot;Murder decreases happiness overall&quot;; this is a second-pattern statement which leads to a first-pattern one: &quot;I disapprove of anything which decreases happiness overall. Do so as well.&quot;

===Methods of argumentation===
For Stevenson, moral disagreements may arise from different fundamental attitudes, different moral beliefs about specific cases, or both. The methods of moral argumentation he proposed have been divided into three groups, known as &quot;logical&quot;, &quot;rational psychological&quot; and &quot;nonrational psychological&quot; forms of argumentation.

Logical methods involve efforts to show inconsistencies between a person&#x27;s fundamental attitudes and their particular moral beliefs. For example, someone who says &quot;Edward is a good person&quot; who has previously said &quot;Edward is a thief&quot; and &quot;No thieves are good people&quot; is guilty of inconsistency until she retracts one of her statements. Similarly, a person who says &quot;Lying is always wrong&quot; might consider lies in some situations to be morally permissible, and if examples of these situations can be given, his view can be shown to be logically inconsistent.

Rational psychological methods examine the facts which relate fundamental attitudes to particular moral beliefs; the goal is not to show that someone has been inconsistent, as with logical methods, but only that they are wrong about the facts which connect their attitudes to their beliefs. To modify the former example, consider the person who holds that all thieves are bad people. If she sees Edward pocket a wallet found in a public place, she may conclude that he is a thief, and there would be no inconsistency between her attitude (that thieves are bad people) and her belief (that Edward is a bad person because he is a thief). However, it may be that Edward recognized the wallet as belonging to a friend, to whom he promptly returned it. Such a revelation would likely change the observer&#x27;s belief about Edward, and even if it did not, the attempt to reveal such facts would count as a rational psychological form of moral argumentation.

Non-rational psychological methods revolve around language with psychological influence but no necessarily logical connection to the listener&#x27;s attitudes. Stevenson called the primary such method &quot;&#x27;persuasive,&#x27; in a somewhat broadened sense&quot;, and wrote:

Persuasion may involve the use of particular emotion-laden words, like &quot;democracy&quot; or &quot;dictator&quot;, or hypothetical questions like &quot;What if everyone thought the way you do?&quot; or &quot;How would you feel if you were in their shoes?&quot;

<doc id="637475" wikidata="Q2298294" url="?curid=637475" title="Rogneda of Polotsk">
<text>Rogneda Rogvolodovna (; Christian name: &quot;Anastasia&quot;; ), also known as Ragnhild (Ragnheiðr), is a person mentioned in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; as having been a princess of Polotsk, the daughter of Rogvolod (Ragnvald), who came from Scandinavia and established himself at Polotsk in the mid-10th century. Vladimir the Great is narrated as having killed her father and taking her as one of his wives.

In a closely related, but separate story in the &quot;Suzdalian Chronicle&quot;, the daughter of Rogvolod of Polotsk is called Gorislava, and Vladimir rapes her in front of her parents before killing her father and taking her as a wife, after which Gorislava attempts to kill Vladimir in revenge.

== Rogned&#x27; in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; ==
Around the year 980, Vladimir, then the prince of Novgorod, was entangled in a war of succession with his brother Yaropolk, the prince of Kiev. Searching for allies, Vladimir proposed to Rogvolod a marriage-tie by wedding his daughter Rogned&#x27; (Rogneda), but she declared: &quot;I do not wish to take off a slave&#x27;s son&#x27;s shoes&quot; (&quot;не хочу розути робичича&quot;), &quot;but I do want to take off Yaropolk&#x27;s&quot;. Afterwards, Vladimir led an army to devastate Polotsk, killing Rogvolod and his two sons, while taking Rogneda as a wife. According to Jonathan Shepard and Simon Franklin, Vladimir was most likely seeking to bolster his political legitimacy rather than being motivated solely by vengeance.

The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; indicates that Vladimir had four sons with Rogneda. The first list, which identifies the mothers of his sons, includes the names of Iziaslav, Mstislav, Yaroslav and Vsevolod as the sons of Rogneda. After Vsevolod are the names of Sviatopolk, Vysheslav, Sviatoslav and another son called Mstislav (possibly Mstislav of Chernigov). A third list identifies the lands that were distributed to them by Vladimir, which appears to be ordered by age, with Vysheslav first, then Iziaslav, Sviatopolk, Sviatoslav, and then Yaroslav; the absence of Mstislav suggests he had died before the distributions were made, and after the initial distributions but before Vladimir&#x27;s death in 1015, Vysheslav and Iziaslav had died, leaving Sviatopolk as the eldest surviving son. After Vladimir converted to Christianity and took Anna Porphyrogeneta as his wife, he had to divorce all his previous wives, including Rogneda. After that, she entered the convent and took the name &quot;Anastasia&quot;.

== Gorislava in the &quot;Suzdalian Chronicle&quot; ==
The later &quot;Suzdalian Chronicle&quot; tells a story, most likely taken from a Norse saga, of Rogvolod&#x27;s daughter – here called &quot;Gorislava&quot; – plotting against Vladimir and asking her elder son, Izyaslav, to kill him. As was the Norse royal custom, she was sent with her elder son to govern the land of her parents, i.e. Polotsk. Izyaslav&#x27;s line continued to rule Polotsk and the newly found town of Izyaslavl (now called Zaslawye).

Modern scholars have examined the differences and similarities between the stories of Rogned&#x27; in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; and Gorislava in the &quot;Suzdalian Chronicle&quot;. Earlier scholars have proposed that Rogned&#x27; (Rogneda) was later &quot;renamed&quot; &quot;Gorislava&quot;, an idea especially promoted by the 16th-century &quot;Nikon Chronicle&quot; as included in Nikolay Karamzin&#x27;s &quot;History of the Russian State&quot; (1816–26). But the first source to suggest these two women were one and the same person, who was somehow renamed, does not appear until the &quot;Moskovskii letopsnyi svod 1479 g.&quot;, 500 years after the events they narrate. Francis Butler (2012) and several other scholars believe that the legend of Gorislava was written later than the legend of Rogned&#x27;, and that the women were initially named differently before later traditions identified them as the same person. Nevertheless, the two narratives contain a brief passage that is almost word for word the same. Aleksandr Koptev (2010) reasoned that &#x27;her attempt to kill her own husband seems to me an obvious later addition to the original story of Rogneda&#x27;. He added: &#x27;Shakhmatov is almost certainly correct when he suggests that the story derives from the later Novgorodian tradition, which asserted the superiority of the clan of Jaroslav&#x27;s descendants in comparison to Rogvolod&#x27;s descendants ruling in Polotzk.&#x27;

== Texts ==

== Legacy ==
Around 1823, Kondraty Ryleev wrote a narrative poem entitled &quot;Rogneda&quot;. This poem became a literary source for her portrayal in the nationalist Russian opera &quot;Rogneda&quot; by Alexander Serov, which premiered in 1865.

== Issue ==
By Vladimir the Great:

# Izyaslav of Polotsk (born c. 979, Kiev), Prince of Polotsk (989–1001)
# Yaroslav the Wise (born no earlier than 983), Prince of Rostov (988–1010), Prince of Novgorod (1010–1034), Grand Prince of Kiev (1016–1018, 1019–1054). Possibly he was a son of Anna rather than Rogneda. Another interesting fact that he was younger than Sviatopolk according to the words of Boris in the &quot;Tale of Bygone Years&quot; and not as it was officially known.
# Mstislav (possibly Mstislav of Chernigov, Prince of Tmutarakan (990–1036), Prince of Chernigov (1024–1036); other sources claim him to be son of other mothers (Adela, Malfrida, or some other Bulgarian wife)
# Predslava, concubine of Bolesław I Chrobry according to Gesta principum Polonorum
# Premislava (died 1015), some source state that she was a wife of the Duke Laszlo (Vladislav) &quot;the Bald&quot; of Arpadians
# Mstislava, in 1018 was taken by Bolesław I Chrobry among the other daughters
# Ariogia (?)

<text>Andrés Eloy Blanco Perez (born April 11, 1984) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, and Philadelphia Phillies.

==Baseball career==
===Kansas City Royals===

<doc id="637485" wikidata="Q7841213" url="?curid=637485" title="Tricky Dicky (Cor!!)">
<text>Tricky Dicky was a British comic strip which originally ran in the British comics magazine &quot;Cor!!&quot;. It debuted in 1970, drawn by Cyril Gwyn Price (1905-1970). It ran until September 29, 1973. After Price&#x27;s death other comic strip artists continued the series.

==Concept==
Similar to Roger the Dodger in &quot;The Beano&quot;, the strip was about a boy of the same name (Dicky), who would &#x27;trick&#x27; his way out of things like washing the car or carrying heavy cases. Unlike Roger, however, his schemes would usually backfire on him. Dicky was a blond boy with a large quiff, who was a teenage boy during his first appearances, but gradually was remodelled into a younger boy as the series went on.

==Similarities with other comics==

There is another British comic strip called &quot;Tricky Dicky&quot;. It also features a young British boy who enjoys playing tricks on others that backfire on him, but it is a completely different character. This particular boy has black spiky hair.

<doc id="637488" wikidata="Q5340800" url="?curid=637488" title="Eduardo Villacis">
<text>Eduardo Enrique Villacis (born August 29, 1979) is a retired starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Kansas City Royals in their 2004 season. Listed at 6&#x27; 2&quot; (1.89 m), 170 lb. (77 k), Villacis batted and threw right handed. He was born in Caracas, Venezuela.

==Career==
Villacis was originally signed by the Colorado Rockies as a rookie free agent out of Venezuela in 1998, under the recommendation of scout and former big leaguer Jorge Posada.

Villacis started his career in the Rockies Minor League system in 2000, playing for them in parts of five seasons before being dealt to Kansas City in exchange for colleague pitcher Bryan Rekar. He then was assigned to Double-A Wichita Wranglers.

On May 1, 2004, the Royals called up him to start a game against the New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium. Villacis lasted only 3 innings, allowing five runs on six hits and four walks without strikeouts and was credited with the loss. He was sent back to Wichita two days later. On May 26, the Chicago White Sox claimed Villacis off waivers from Kansas City and optioned him to Double-A Birmingham Barons, but he never appeared in a major league game again.

In 2006, Villacis played for the Atlantic City Surf of the independent Atlantic League, during what turned out to be his final year in baseball. Overall, he posted a 29-17 record with a 3.58 earned run average in 145 career minor league games, including 49 starts, from 2000–2006.

In between, Villacis played winter ball with the Leones del Caracas and Tiburones de La Guaira clubs of the Venezuelan League during seven seasons spanning 1998–2005. He started eight games and relieved in 97 more, going 8-5 with a 3.87 ERA and one save in 151 innings of work.

<doc id="637489" wikidata="Q319124" url="?curid=637489" title="Battle of Ipsus">
<text>The Battle of Ipsus () was fought between some of the Diadochi (the successors of Alexander the Great) in 301 BC near the town of Ipsus in Phrygia. Antigonus I Monophthalmus, the Macedonian ruler of large parts of Asia, and his son Demetrius were pitted against the coalition of three other successors of Alexander: Cassander, ruler of Macedon; Lysimachus, ruler of Thrace; and Seleucus I Nicator, ruler of Babylonia and Persia. 

==Sources==
Diodorus Siculus is the principal source for the history of the Diadochi, in his &#x27;Library of history&#x27; (&quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;). Diodorus is often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else. Diodorus worked primarily by epitomizing the works of other historians, omitting many details where they did not suit his purpose, which was to illustrate moral lessons from history. However, since Diodorus provides the only continuous narrative for the history of the &quot;Diadochi&quot;, we have no alternative but to rely on his account. Unfortunately, from book XXI onwards (301 BC), including the actual Battle of Ipsus, the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; only exists in fragments. Nevertheless, Diodorus provides extensive details of the Fourth War of the Diadochi leading up to Ipsus. It is generally thought that Diodorus&#x27;s source for much of this period was the now-lost history of the Diadochi written by Hieronymus of Cardia. Hieronymus was a friend of Eumenes, and later became a member of the Antigonid court; he was therefore very much familiar and contemporary with the events he described, and possibly a direct eyewitness to some.

The only full description of the battle available is in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Demetrius&quot;. Plutarch was writing some 400 years after the events in question, and is therefore a secondary source, but he often names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements. Plutarch was also primarily interested in moral lessons from history, rather than actually detailing history in depth, and thus his description of the battle does not go into great detail.

==Background==

In the aftermath of the Second War of the Diadochi (315 BC), the aging satrap Antigonus I Monophthalmus had been left in undisputed control of the Asian territories of the Macedonian empire (Asia Minor, Syria and the vast eastern satrapies). This left Antigonus in prime position to claim overall rule over the Macedonian empire. Antigonus&#x27;s growing power alarmed the other major Successors, resulting in the eruption of the Third War of the Diadochi in 314 BC, in which Antigonus faced a coalition of Cassander (ruler of Macedonia), Lysimachus (ruler of Thrace) and Ptolemy (ruler of Egypt). Only one of these leaders, Lysimachus, had actually been one of Alexander&#x27;s somatophylakes. This war ended in a compromise peace in 311 BC, after which Antigonus attacked Seleucus, who was attempting to re-establish himself in the eastern Satrapies of the empire. The resulting Babylonian War lasted from 311 to 309 BC, and resulted in defeat for Antigonus, allowing Seleucus to re-claim the satrapy of Babylonia and overlordship of the territories to the east.

While Antigonus was distracted elsewhere, Ptolemy had been expanding his power into the Aegean Sea and to Cyprus. Antigonus thus resumed the war with Ptolemy in 308 BC, beginning the Fourth War of the Diadochi. Antigonus sent his son Demetrius to regain control of Greece, and in 307 BC he took Athens, expelling Demetrius of Phaleron, Cassander&#x27;s governor, and proclaiming the city free again. Demetrius then turned his attention to Ptolemy, invading Cyprus and defeating Ptolemy&#x27;s fleet at the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus. In the aftermath of this victory, Antigonus and Demetrius both assumed the crown of Macedon, in which they were shortly followed by Ptolemy, Seleucus, Lysimachus, and eventually Cassander.

In 306, Antigonus attempted to invade Egypt, but storms prevented Demetrius&#x27;s fleet from supplying him, and he was forced to return home. With Cassander and Ptolemy both weakened, and Seleucus still occupied by attempting to assert his control over the East, Antigonus and Demetrius now turned their attention to Rhodes, which was besieged by Demetrius&#x27;s forces in 305 BC. The island was reinforced by troops from Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Cassander. Ultimately, the Rhodians reached a compromise with Demetrius – they would support Antigonus and Demetrius against all enemies, save their ally Ptolemy. Ptolemy took the title of Soter (&quot;Savior&quot;) for his role in preventing the fall of Rhodes, but the victory was ultimately Demetrius&#x27;s, as it left him with a free hand to attack Cassander in Greece. Demetrius thus returned to Greece and set about liberating the cities of Greece, expelling Cassander&#x27;s garrisons, and the pro-Antipatrid oligarchies. This occupied much of Demetrius&#x27;s efforts in 303 and 302 BC.

Seeing that Demetrius&#x27;s war effort was aimed at destroying his power in Greece, and ultimately in Macedonia, Cassander tried to come to terms with Antigonus. However, Antigonus rejected these advances, intent on forcing Cassander&#x27;s complete surrender. Cassander therefore held counsel with Lysimachus, and they agreed on a joint strategy that included sending envoys to Ptolemy and Seleucus, asking them to join in combatting the Antigonid threat. Seeking to take the initiative, Cassander sent a significant portion of the Macedonian army under Prepelaus to Lysimachus, which was to be used in joint operations in Asia Minor. Meanwhile, Cassander took the rest of the Macedonian army into Thessaly to confront Demetrius.

==Prelude==

Lysimachus crossed over the Hellespont in 302 BC, intending to take advantage of Antigonus&#x27;s absence in Syria by overrunning Asia Minor. The cities of Lampsakos and Parion submitted to him, but he had to storm Sigeion, after which he installed a garrison there. He then sent Prepelaus with 7,000 men to attack Aeolis and Ionia, while he besieged Abydos. This siege was unsuccessful however, since Demetrius sent the city reinforcements from Greece by sea. Lysimachus instead went on to win over Hellespontine Phrygia, and then captured the major administrative centre of Synnada. Meanwhile, Prepelaus captured Adramyttion, Ephesos, Teos, and Colophon; he could not however capture Erythrae or Clazomenae, again due to sea-borne reinforcements. Finally, Prepelaus moved inland and captured Sardis, another major administrative centre.

When Antigonus received news of the invasion, he abandoned preparations for a great festival to be held in Antigonia, and quickly began to march his army northwards from Syria, through Cilicia, Cappadocia, Lycaonia, and into Phrygia. Lysimachus, hearing of the approach of Antigonus&#x27;s army, held counsel with his officers, and decided to avoid open battle until Seleucus&#x27;s arrival. The allies thus defended their camp with entrenchments and palisades, and when Antigonus arrived offering battle, they remained within the camp. Antigonus therefore moved to cut off the allies&#x27; provisions, forcing Lysimachus to abandon the camp and make a night-time march of some 40 miles to Dorylaion. There, the allies built a new, triple-palisaded camp amongst the hills, with relatively easy access to food and water. Antigonus followed closely behind, and laid siege to the allied camp, bringing up catapults for the assault. Lysimachus sent sorties to try to disrupt the siege-works, but the Antigonid forces always ended with the upper hand in ensuing skirmishes. With the siege works nearing completion and food running low, Lysimachus decided to abandon the camp, and marched away during a night-time storm. Antigonus again attempted to follow, but as winter approached with further rain, conditions became difficult, and he abandoned pursuit and dispersed his men into winter quarters instead. The allied army marched on into Bithynia and went into winter quarters in and around the city of Heraclea.

Whilst settling his army for the winter, Antigonus heard the news that Seleucus was en route from the eastern satrapies to support Lysimachus. He therefore dispatched messengers to Demetrius, ordering him to bring his army over to Asia to reinforce the Antigonid forces. Demetrius had in the meantime continued his campaign in Greece, and although Cassander had blocked the land-passes, Demetrius had entered Thessaly by sea. There had followed a somewhat inconsequential campaign of manoeuvre between the two armies in Thessaly, before Demetrius received his father&#x27;s messages asking for reinforcements. Demetrius thus hastily arranged a truce with Cassander, and took his army by sea across the Aegean to Ephesos. He recaptured Ephesos, and marched north to the Hellespont, where he established a strong garrison and fleet to prevent European reinforcements reaching the allied army in Asia. Demetrius then also dispersed his army into winter quarters.

In the absence of Demetrius, Cassander now felt able to send further reinforcements to Lysimachus, under the command of his brother, Pleistarchus. Since Demetrius was guarding the easy crossing points at the Hellespont and the Bosphorus, Pleistarchus attempted to ship his men directly across the Black Sea to Heraclea, using the port of Odessos. The men had to be sent in batches due to a lack of ships, and although the first batch arrived safely, the second shipment was intercepted by Demetrius&#x27;s fleet, and the third wrecked in a storm. Pleistarchus himself narrowly survived the wreck of his command ship, eventually being carried to Heraclea to recuperate over the winter. Similarly, the concentration of Antigonid forces in Asia now made Ptolemy feel secure enough to bring an army out of Egypt to try to conquer Coele Syria. He captured a number of cities, but while laying siege to Sidon, he was brought false reports of an Antigonid victory, and told that Antigonus was marching south into Syria. He thus garrisoned the cities he had captured, and retreated into Egypt. At around the same time, Seleucus appears to have finished his march from the east, arriving in Cappadocia with his army, which he then sent into winter quarters.

Diodorus completes book XX of his Library at this point, saying that he will describe the battle between the Kings at the start of the next book. However, only fragments remain of books XXI onwards, and although some fragments of his description of the battle do remain, they do not form a coherent narrative. In his description of the battle, Plutarch does not describe the preliminary manoeuvring that must have occurred in 301 BC before the battle, so it is unclear how events unfolded. Lysimachus and Seleucus were probably anxious to bring Antigonus to battle, since their respective power-centres in Thrace and Babylon were vulnerable in their prolonged absence. The armies eventually met in battle around 50 miles north-east of Synnada, near the village of Ipsus. Antigonus was aware of Ptolemy&#x27;s raid on Syria the previous year, and thus would have been loath to be cut off from Syria and his capital in Antigonia, and thus moved to intercept the allied army. The exact location of the battle is unknown, but it occurred in a large open plain, well-suited for both the allied preponderance of elephants and the Antigonid superiority in cavalry numbers and training.

==Opposing forces==

===Antigonids===
According to Plutarch, Antigonus&#x27;s army before the battle numbered around 70,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry and 75 war elephants. The majority of this number were presumably supplied by Antigonus&#x27;s army that marched from Syria, since Demetrius&#x27;s army in Greece had no elephants and only 1,500 cavalry. Diodorus claims that Demetrius&#x27;s had approximately 56,000 infantry in Greece (8,000 Macedonian phalangites, 15,000 mercenaries, 25,000 troops from Greek cities and 8,000 light troops), but it is unclear what proportion of this infantry accompanied him to Asia. Based on other battles between the Diadochi, modern experts estimate that of the 70,000 Antigonid infantry, perhaps 40,000 were phalangites and 30,000 were light troops of various kinds.

===Allies===
Plutarch gives a total of 64,000 infantry for the allies, with 10,500 cavalry, 400 elephants and 120 scythed chariots. Diodorus claims that Seleucus brought 20,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry (including mounted archers), 480 elephants and more than a hundred scythed chariots with him from the eastern satrapies. The numbers of elephants and chariots supposed to be present at the battle are therefore relatively consistent between these sources. However, Seleucus&#x27;s cavalry component according to Diodorus is alone larger than Plutarch&#x27;s claims for the whole allied cavalry, and Lysimachus must have had at least some cavalry; he sent at least 1,000 horsemen with Prepelaus the previous year. Modern experts thus estimate the total number of allied cavalry at 15,000. Of the 44,000 non-Seleucid infantry, it is unclear what proportion were supplied by Cassander and Lysimachus respectively. Cassander sent 12,000 men under Pleistarchus, of which two-thirds were lost in crossing the Black Sea, but it is not clear how many men were in the initial dispatch of troops sent under Prepelaus. Modern experts estimate that, of the allies&#x27; total infantry, perhaps 30,000–40,000 were phalangites, with the remainder being light troop types.

==Strategic and tactical considerations==

In terms of overall strategy, it is clear that both sides had resolved on battle; for the allies, it represented the best chance of stopping Antigonid expansion, rather than allowing themselves to be defeated piecemeal. For Antigonus, the chance to defeat all his enemies at once could not be passed up, even if he would have preferred to defeat them individually. However, little is known about the specific strategic considerations facing the two sides before the battle, as the precise circumstances and location of the engagement remain uncertain. As mentioned above, it has been suggested that the allied army was trying to cut Antigonus&#x27;s lines of communication with Syria, in order to prompt him into battle, but this is only one of several possible scenarios.

Tactically, both sides faced the common problem of the wars fought amongst the Successors; how to defeat an army equipped in the same manner and using the same basic tactics. The Diadochi seem to have been inherently conservative, and continued to favour a strong attack with cavalry on the right wing of the battle-line (tactics commonly used by both Philip and Alexander) as the principal tactical thrust – even though they must have been aware of the likelihood their opponents would perform the same maneuver on the opposite side of the battlefield. When armies were numerically even and deploying the same tactics, gaining a clear advantage was difficult. The use of novel weapons, such as war elephants and scythed chariots, to change the tactical balance was one approach used by the Diadochi, but such innovations were readily copied. Thus, both sides at Ipsus had war elephants, although thanks to Seleucus, the allies were able to field an unusually high number, in addition to scythed chariots. Both sides therefore sought an open battlefield; the allies in order to use their elephants to full potential, and the Antigonids to allow full use of their strong cavalry arm. For the Antigonids, strong in both infantry and cavalry, the tactical situation was straightforward, and followed the template Successor tactic of a massive cavalry assault on the right wing. For the allies, weaker in infantry, the tactics would have been to maximize their overwhelming superiority in elephants, though it is not clear exactly how they intended to do this. Nevertheless, the elephants played a pivotal role in the battle.

==Battle==
===Deployment===
Both sides probably deployed their troops in a standard Macedonian formation, with the phalanx of heavy infantry in the centre of the battle line. In front, and to the sides of the phalanx, light infantry were deployed to act as skirmishers and to protect the flanks of the phalanx; cavalry was split between the two wings. In the Antigonid line, Demetrius commanded the best of the cavalry, stationed on the right wing. Antigonus, with his personal bodyguard, was positioned in the centre behind the phalanx. The 75 elephants were deployed in front of the battle-line with their infantry guards.

The situation with the allied deployment is less clear. Plutarch states that Seleucus&#x27;s son Antiochus was in command of the cavalry on the left wing, traditionally the weaker wing in the Macedonian system, intended only to skirmish. However, it has been suggested that on this occasion the allied cavalry were evenly split between the two wings. We do not know who commanded the right wing, nor where Lysimachus, Seleucus or Pleistarchus were stationed. It is clear that some of Seleucus&#x27;s elephants were placed in front of the battle line, but not how many, though a figure of 100 is often suggested. It has been suggested that Seleucus retained command of the majority of his elephants in a tactical reserve, but the use of such a large reserve would have been unprecedented in battles amongst the successors. Furthermore, it would have meant shunning an opportunity to deploy the major tactical advantage held by the allies. As modern sources point out, understanding this &#x27;elephant problem&#x27; is key to understanding the outcome of the battle, but the ancient sources do not allow the point to be resolved.

===Initial phase===
The battle seems to have begun in earnest with a clash of the elephants from both sides. Diodorus says that &quot;the elephants of Antigonus and Lysimachus fought as if nature had matched them equally in courage and strength&quot;, suggesting that they were also equal in number (and supporting the idea of a large reserve of elephants on the allied side). Demetrius then launched the principal Antigonid thrust, manoeuvering his cavalry around the elephants and attacking the allied cavalry under Antiochus. Plutarch says that Demetrius &quot;fought brilliantly and routed his enemy&quot;. However it is also clear that Demetrius allowed the pursuit of the routed allied cavalry to go too far, resulting in his men becoming isolated from the battlefield.

===Second phase===
It is not explicitly stated by Plutarch, but it has been assumed that the two phalanxes engaged each other during the battle. If this was the case, then the Antigonid strategy would have been for Demetrius to take his cavalry and attack the rear of the allied phalanx, or, alternatively, to return to station on the right wing and protect the Antigonid phalanx&#x27;s flank. However, Demetrius found himself unable to return to the battlefield because of the deployment of 300 elephants in his path. The ancient sources repeatedly emphasise the effect of elephants on horses, which are alarmed by the smell and noise of elephants and are loath to approach them. Demetrius would not have been able to take his horses through the line of elephants, nor manoeuvre around such a large quantity of elephants. This &#x27;elephant manoeuvre&#x27; was the decisive moment in the battle, but it is not clear how it came about; Plutarch only says that &quot;the [allied] elephants were thrown in his way&quot;. If the elephants had indeed been held in reserve, then it might have been relatively straightforward to deploy them, but as discussed, it is not clear why so many elephants would have been held in reserve. However, it is also possible that the deployment of the elephants was a piece of improvisation during the battle, though moving such a large number of elephants in such a coordinated manoeuvre in the middle of the battle would have been difficult. Since he was the only allied commander with significant experience of handling elephants, it has been assumed that Seleucus was responsible for this manoeuvre.

With Demetrius now isolated from the battlefield, the Antigonid phalanx was exposed on its right flank. Plutarch describes what followed:

The Antigonid phalanx and Allied phalanx engaged in a stiff and chaotic fight.

This move against the Antigonid right flank probably involved detaching cavalry from the allies own right wing, including Seleucus&#x27;s horse-archers, who could rain down missiles on the immobile phalanx. The morale of the troops appears to have collapsed, and it seems that some of the heavy infantry either defected to the allied side or otherwise fled. Antigonus, stationed in the centre, tried to rally his men, hoping for Demetrius&#x27;s return. However, he was gradually surrounded by allied infantry and eventually killed by several javelins thrown by allied skirmishers. With the death of its commander, the Antigonid battle-line dissolved, and the battle effectively ended.

==Aftermath==
From the wreck of the Antigonid army and the death of his father, Demetrius managed to recover 5,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, and escaped with them to Ephesos. Despite the expectation that he would raid the Ephesian treasury, Demetrius instead immediately set sail for Greece &quot;putting his chief remaining hopes in Athens&quot;. However, he was to be disappointed; the Athenians had voted not to allow any of the kings into Athens. Concealing his wrath, he asked the Athenians for the return of his ships that were moored there, and then sailed on to the Isthmus of Corinth. He found that everywhere his garrisons were being expelled, and his erstwhile allies defecting to the other kings. He left Pyrrhus of Epirus (at that time part of the Antigonid faction) in charge of the Antigonid cause in Greece, and himself sailed to the Thracian Chersonesos.

The last chance to reunite the Alexandrine Empire had already been passed when Antigonus lost the Babylonian War and two thirds of his empire. Ipsus confirmed this failure. As Paul K. Davis writes, &quot;Ipsus was the high point of the struggle among Alexander the Great’s successors to create an international Hellenistic empire, which Antigonus failed to do.&quot; Instead, the empire was carved up between the victors, with Ptolemy retaining Egypt, Seleucus expanding his power to eastern Asia Minor, and Lysimachus receiving the remainder of Asia Minor. Eventually Seleucus would defeat Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC, but he was assassinated shortly afterward. Ipsus finalized the breakup of an empire, which may account for its obscurity; despite that, it was still a critical battle in classical history and decided the character of the Hellenistic age.

<text>CTV Sci-Fi Channel is a Canadian English-language discretionary specialty channel owned by Bell Media subsidairy of BCE Inc.. The channel primarily broadcasts speculative fiction and related programming.

The network was launched on October 17, 1997 as Space under its original parent company CHUM Limited. Its slogan, &quot;The Imagination Station&quot;, continued to be used informally by its fans for many years after its retirement. In 2007, Space was acquired by CTVglobemedia, after acquiring CHUM Limited, while the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers Media. The channel adopted its current name in 2019.

== History ==

The channel was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in 1996. It launched on October 17, 1997 at 6:00 p.m. ET (3:00 p.m. PT), as Space: The Imagination Station, launching under the ownership of CHUM Limited, airing the film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, followed by a commentary on that film by author Robert J. Sawyer, followed by the film &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;. The Sawyer commentary was the first example of the interstitial materials — mostly produced by Mark Askwith — that became SPACE&#x27;s signature: short, snappy, mini-documentaries on science fiction and science topics shown between programs, collectively known as &quot;SPACE Flow&quot;. Daily installments include &quot;Space News&quot; (formerly &quot;SPIN&quot;, for &quot;Space Information and News&quot;).

CTVglobemedia took over Space on June 22, 2007, as a result of a takeover of CHUM Limited. At the same time, the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers later that year. Ownership changed hands once again when on April 1, 2011, BCE Inc. gained 100% control of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s non-publishing assets that it did not already own, placing Space under the ownership of Bell Media.

On February 8, 2011, the Reeves-Stevenses submitted a letter to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in support of an application by CTVglobemedia to renew the broadcasting license of Space.

On July 6, 2011, a high definition simulcast of Space was launched. It is available through all major television providers in Canada.

On March 4, 2013, Space introduced a new logo to coincide with the premiere of the channel&#x27;s new original co-production &quot;Orphan Black&quot;. A Bell Media executive explained that the branding was designed to reflect upon the broadening of the sci-fi genre beyond outer space and &quot;people in polyester onesies running around with taser guns&quot;, by portraying the new logo in the form of real-life objects with a &quot;phenomenal twist&quot; to symbolize the &quot;space around you&quot;. Through Bell Media&#x27;s acquisition of Astral Media, Space is now co-owned with the French-language, sci-fi channel, Ztélé (since renamed Z).

On June 7, 2018, it was announced that Space would be rebranded as &quot;CTV Sci-Fi&quot;, as part of a re-alignment of several Bell Media specialty channels under the CTV brand. The following year, it was revealed the channel would instead rebrand as CTV Sci-Fi Channel on September 12, 2019.

== Programming ==
CTV Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s programming includes scripted television series and films primarily focused on the science fiction, fantasy, superhero fiction, horror, and paranormal genres, often in a marathon format outside of prime time. The channel&#x27;s original programming has included in-studio shows (including the daily newsmagazine &quot;Innerspace&quot;), scripted dramas, as well as shows co-produced with the U.S. channel Syfy, from which the channel also acquires the bulk of its programming.

The channel holds the linear television rights to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television franchise in Canada, holding library rights to past &quot;Star Trek&quot; television seasons and movies, and having acquired the rights to the newer &quot;Star Trek&quot; era run, &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, produced for the Paramount+ streaming service.

<doc id="637496" wikidata="Q7893530" url="?curid=637496" title="United States v. Wong Kim Ark">
<text>United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898), is a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court which held that &quot;a child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China&quot;, automatically became a U.S. citizen at birth. &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; was the first Supreme Court case to decide on the status of children born in the United States to alien parents. This decision established an important precedent in its interpretation of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco in 1873, had been denied re-entry to the United States after a trip abroad, under the Chinese Exclusion Act, a law banning virtually all Chinese immigration and prohibiting Chinese immigrants from becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. He challenged the government&#x27;s refusal to recognize his citizenship, and the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, holding that the Citizenship Clause should be interpreted &quot;in light of the common law&quot;. The case highlighted disagreements over the precise meaning of one phrase in the Citizenship Clause—namely, the provision that a person born in the United States who is &quot;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot; acquires automatic citizenship. 

The Supreme Court&#x27;s majority concluded that this phrase referred to being required to obey U.S. law; on this basis, they interpreted the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to grant citizenship to children born in the United States, with only a limited set of exceptions based on English common law. The Court held that being born to alien parents was not one of those exceptions. The court&#x27;s dissenters argued that being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States meant not being subject to any foreign power—that is, not being claimed as a citizen by another country via &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; (inheriting citizenship from a parent)—an interpretation which, in the minority&#x27;s view, would have excluded &quot;the children of foreigners, happening to be born to them while passing through the country&quot;.

In the words of a 2007 legal analysis of events following the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; decision, &quot;The parameters of the &quot;jus soli&quot; principle, as stated by the court in &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot;, have never been seriously questioned by the Supreme Court, and have been accepted as dogma by lower courts.&quot; A 2010 review of the history of the Citizenship Clause notes that the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; decision held that the guarantee of birthright citizenship &quot;applies to children of foreigners present on American soil&quot; and states that the Supreme Court &quot;has not re-examined this issue since the concept of &#x27;illegal alien&#x27; entered the language&quot;. Since the 1990s, however, controversy has arisen over the longstanding practice of granting automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, and legal scholars disagree over whether the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; precedent applies when alien parents are in the country illegally. Attempts have been made from time to time in Congress to restrict birthright citizenship, either via statutory redefinition of the term &quot;jurisdiction&quot;, or by overriding both the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; ruling and the Citizenship Clause itself through an amendment to the Constitution, but no such proposal has been enacted.

== Background ==

=== Early history of United States citizenship law ===
Throughout the history of the United States, the dominant legal principle governing citizenship has been &quot;jus soli&quot;—the principle that birth within the territorial limits of the United States confers automatic citizenship, excluding slaves before the American Civil War. Although there was no actual definition of citizenship in United States law until after the Civil War, it was generally accepted that anyone born in the United States was automatically a citizen. 

The common law principle of &quot;jus soli&quot; was upheld in an 1844 New York state case, &quot;Lynch v. Clarke&quot;, in which a state judge held that a woman born in New York City, of alien parents temporarily sojourning there, was a U.S. citizen.

African slaves were originally excluded from United States citizenship. In 1857, the United States Supreme Court held in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; that slaves, former slaves, and their descendants were not eligible under the Constitution to be citizens. Additionally, Native Americans were not originally recognized as citizens, since Native American tribes were considered to be outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.

=== Citizenship clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ===
After the Civil War and the subsequent abolition of slavery, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866. One provision of this law declared as citizens not only the freed slaves, but &quot;all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed&quot;. Soon after the passage of the Act, Congress drafted the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution and sent it to the states for ratification (a process which was completed in 1868). Among the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s many provisions was the Citizenship Clause, which entrenched a guarantee of citizenship in the Constitution by stating, &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&quot;

==== Legislative history ====
Concerns were raised that the citizenship guarantee in the Civil Rights Act might be repealed by a later Congress or struck down as unconstitutional by the courts. Soon after the passage of the Act, Congress drafted the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution and sent it to the states for ratification (a process which was completed in 1868). Among the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s many provisions was the Citizenship Clause, which entrenched a guarantee of citizenship in the Constitution by stating, &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&quot;

The Citizenship Clause was proposed by Senator Jacob M. Howard of Michigan on May 30, 1866, as an amendment to the joint resolution from the House of Representatives which had framed the initial draft of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment. The heated debate on the proposed new language in the Senate focused on whether Howard&#x27;s proposed language would apply more broadly than the wording of the 1866 Civil Rights Act.

Howard said that the clause &quot;is simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already, that every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United States.&quot; He added that citizenship &quot;will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons&quot;—a comment which would later raise questions as to whether Congress had originally intended that U.S.-born children of foreign parents were to be included as citizens. 

James R. Doolittle of Wisconsin objected that the citizenship provision would not be sufficiently narrow to exclude Native Americans from citizenship, and in an attempt to address this issue, he proposed to add a phrase taken from the Civil Rights Act—&quot;excluding Indians not taxed&quot;. Although most Senators agreed that birthright citizenship should not be extended to Native Americans, a majority saw no need to clarify the issue, and Doolittle&#x27;s proposal was voted down. Upon its return to the House of Representatives, the proposed Fourteenth Amendment received little debate; no one spoke in opposition to the Senate&#x27;s addition of the Citizenship Clause, and the complete proposed amendment was approved by the House on June 13, 1866, and declared to have been ratified on July 28, 1868.

In 2006, Goodwin Liu, then an assistant professor at the Boalt Hall law school of the University of California, Berkeley, and later an Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court, wrote that although the legislative history of the Citizenship Clause is &quot;somewhat thin&quot;, the clause&#x27;s central role is evident in the historical context of the post-Civil War period. Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center (a progressive think tank), argues that both supporters and opponents of the Citizenship Clause in 1866 shared the understanding that it would automatically grant citizenship to all persons born in the United States (except children of foreign ministers and invading armies)—an interpretation shared by Texas Solicitor General James C. Ho. Richard Aynes, dean of the University of Akron School of Law, takes a different view, proposing that the Citizenship Clause had &quot;consequences which were unintended by the framers&quot;.

==== Cases prior to &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; ====
The Supreme Court ruled in an 1884 case (&quot;Elk v. Wilkins&quot;) that an Indian born on a reservation did not acquire United States citizenship at birth (because he was not subject to U.S. jurisdiction) and could not claim citizenship later on merely by moving to non-reservation U.S. territory and renouncing his former tribal allegiance. Native Americans were subsequently granted citizenship by an act of Congress in 1924.

The question of whether the Citizenship Clause applied to persons born in the United States to Chinese immigrants first came before the courts in an 1884 case, &quot;In re Look Tin Sing&quot;. Look Tin Sing was born in Mendocino, California in 1870 to Chinese immigrants. In 1879, his merchant father sent him to China; but upon returning from China in 1884 at age 14, he was barred from reentering the United States by officials who objected to his not having met the documentation requirements imposed at the time on Chinese immigrants under the Restriction Acts of 1882 or of 1884. Look&#x27;s case was heard in the federal circuit court for California by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen J. Field and two other federal judges. Lucy E. Salyer, a history professor at the University of New Hampshire, writes that Justice Field &quot;issued an open invitation to all lawyers in the area to give their opinions on the constitutional questions involved&quot; in the case. Field focused on the meaning of the &quot;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot; phrase of the Citizenship Clause, held that Look was indeed subject to U.S. jurisdiction at the time of his birth irrespective of the alien status of his parents, and on this basis ordered U.S. officials to recognize Look as a citizen and allow him to enter the United States. The &quot;Look Tin Sing&quot; ruling was not appealed and was never reviewed by the Supreme Court. A similar conclusion was reached by the federal circuit court for Oregon in the 1888 cases of &quot;Ex parte Chin King&quot; and &quot;Ex parte Chan San Hee&quot;.

In an 1892 case, &quot;Gee Fook Sing v. U.S.&quot;, a federal appeals court in California for the same circuit (by this time known as the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals) concluded that a Chinese man would have been recognized as a United States citizen if he could have presented satisfactory evidence that he had in fact been born in the U.S. This case was also never brought before the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s 1873 &quot;Slaughterhouse Cases&quot; decision contained the statement that &quot;The phrase, &#x27;subject to its jurisdiction,&#x27; was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign states born within the United States.&quot; However, since the &quot;Slaughterhouse Cases&quot; did not deal with claims of birthright citizenship, this comment was dismissed in &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; and later cases as a passing remark (&quot;obiter dictum&quot;) lacking any force as a controlling precedent. As to whether the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; decision was correct on this point or not, modern scholars are divided.

=== Chinese Exclusion Acts ===

Like many other immigrants, Chinese were drawn to the United States—initially to participate in the California Gold Rush of 1849, then moving on to railroad construction, farming, and work in cities. An 1868 treaty (named the Burlingame Treaty after one of the American negotiators) expanded trade and migration between the United States and China. The treaty did not address the citizenship of children born in the United States to Chinese parents, or vice versa. Regarding naturalization (acquisition of citizenship other than at birth), the treaty contained a provision stating that &quot;nothing herein contained shall be held to confer naturalization ... upon the subjects of China in the United States.&quot;

Chinese immigrants to the United States were met with considerable distrust, resentment, and discrimination almost from the time of their first arrival. Many politicians argued that the Chinese were so different in so many ways that they not only would never (or even could) assimilate into American culture, but that they represented a threat to the country&#x27;s principles and institutions. In this climate of popular anti-Chinese sentiment, Congress in 1882 enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, which placed limits on Chinese immigration to the United States. (The original Chinese Exclusion Act was amended several times—such as by the 1888 Scott Act and the 1892 Geary Act—and as a result, it is sometimes referred to in the plural as the &quot;Chinese Exclusion Acts&quot;.) Chinese already in the U.S. were allowed to stay, but they were ineligible for naturalization and, if they left the U.S. and later wished to return, they needed to apply anew and obtain approval again. Chinese laborers and miners were specifically barred from coming (or returning) to the United States under the terms of the law.

==Case history==
=== Wong Kim Ark ===
Wong Kim Ark (; Taishanese: &quot;Vong3 Gim1-ak2&quot;; – after 1931) was born in San Francisco, California, at 751 Sacramento Street, the address of a Chinatown business (Quong Sing) maintained by his merchant parents. Various sources state or imply his year of birth as being 1873, 1871, or 1868. His father, Wong Si Ping, and mother, Lee Wee, emigrated from Taishan, Guangdong, China and were not United States citizens, as the Naturalization Law of 1802 had made them ineligible for naturalization either before or after his birth. Wong did not become a merchant like his father, but worked as a cook in Chinatown restaurants.

In 1889, Wong Kim Ark, then in his late teens, left for China with his parents, who decided to repatriate to China and to their ancestral village in Taishan, Ong Sing. While in Taishan, Wong Kim Ark married Yee Shee from a village near his familial one. Returning to the United States in 1890, he left behind in Taishan not only his parents but also his wife, who gave birth to their first son after he returned to California. Under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, he as a laborer could not bring his wife to the United States. Upon arrival alone at San Francisco in July 1890, he was readmitted on the ground that he was a native-born citizen of the United States, but only after an unnamed Bureau of Immigration official left a note in his file questioning the veracity of his claim of birth in the United States.

In November 1894, Wong sailed to China for another temporary visit, to rejoin his wife at his family&#x27;s village in Taishan, Guangdong. He met his oldest son for the first time, and his second son was conceived. But when he returned in August 1895 by SS &quot;Coptic&quot;, he was detained at the Port of San Francisco by the Collector of Customs, who denied him permission to enter the country, arguing that Wong was not a U.S. citizen despite his having been born in the U.S., but was instead a Chinese subject because his parents were Chinese. Wong was confined for five months on steamships off the coast of San Francisco while his case was being tried.

=== Lower Courts ===
According to Salyer, the San Francisco attorney George Collins had tried to persuade the federal Justice Department to bring a Chinese birthright citizenship case before the Supreme Court. An article by Collins was published in the May/June 1895 &quot;American Law Review&quot;, criticizing the &quot;Look Tin Sing&quot; ruling by Judge Field and the federal government&#x27;s unwillingness to challenge it, and advocating the international law view of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; citizenship. Eventually, Collins was able to convince U.S. Attorney Henry Foote, who &quot;searched for a viable test case and settled on Wong Kim Ark&quot;.

With the assistance of legal representation by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, Wong Kim Ark challenged the refusal to recognize his birth claim to U.S. citizenship, and a petition for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; was filed on his behalf in federal district court. 

The arguments presented before District Judge William W. Morrow centered on which of two competing interpretations of the phrase &quot;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot; in the Citizenship Clause should govern a situation involving a child born in the United States to alien parents. 

The U.S. government claimed that &quot;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot; meant &quot;to be subject to the political jurisdiction of the United States&quot;—an interpretation, based on international law, which would exclude parents and their children who owed allegiance to another country via the principle of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; (citizenship inherited from a parent). They argued that Wong&#x27;s claim to U.S. citizenship was ruled out by the Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of jurisdiction in its 1873 &quot;Slaughterhouse Cases&quot; ruling. The question of the citizenship status of U.S.-born children of alien parents had, up to this time, never been decided by the Supreme Court leading Judge Morrow to decide that the remark about the citizenship clause in &quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; was &quot;obiter dictum&quot;. The government also cited a similar statement in &quot;Elk v. Wilkins&quot;, but the judge was not convinced by this argument either.

Wong&#x27;s attorneys argued that the phrase meant subject to the laws of the United States,&#x27; comprehending, in this expression, the allegiance that aliens owe in a foreign country to obey its laws&quot;—an interpretation, based on the common law inherited by the United States from England, that would encompass essentially everyone born in the U.S. via the principle of &quot;jus soli&quot; (citizenship based on place of birth). Wong&#x27;s attorneys cited the &quot;Look Tin Sing&quot; case, and the district judge agreed that in the absence of clear direction from the Supreme Court, this case definitively settled the question of citizenship for Wong and others like him as far as federal courts in the Ninth Circuit were concerned. The judge saw the &quot;Look Tin Sing&quot; holding reaffirmed in the &quot;Gee Fook Sing&quot; case and noted further that another part of the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse Cases&quot; opinion said that &quot;it is only necessary that [a man] should be born or naturalized in the United States to be a citizen of the Union.&quot; Concluding that the &quot;Look Tin Sing&quot; decision constituted a controlling precedent in the Ninth Circuit, Judge Morrow ruled that &quot;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot; referred to being subject to U.S. law (the first of the two proposed interpretations). On January 3, 1896, the judge declared Wong Kim Ark to be a citizen because he was born in the U.S.

The U.S. government appealed the district court ruling directly to the United States Supreme Court. According to Salyer, government officials—realizing that the decision in this case &quot;was of great importance, not just to Chinese Americans, but to all American citizens who had been born to alien parents&quot;, and concerned about the possible effect of an early ruling by the Supreme Court on the 1896 presidential election—delayed the timing of their appeal so as to avoid the possibility of a decision based more on policy concerns than the merits of the case. Oral arguments before the Supreme Court were held on March 5, 1897. Solicitor General Holmes Conrad presented the government&#x27;s case; Wong was represented before the Court by Maxwell Evarts, former U.S. Assistant Attorney General J. Hubley Ashton, and Thomas D. Riordan.

== Supreme Court ==
The Supreme Court considered the &quot;single question&quot; in the case to be &quot;whether a child born in the United States, of parent[s] of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States.&quot; It was conceded that if Wong was a U.S. citizen, &quot;the acts of Congress known as the &#x27;Chinese Exclusion Acts,&#x27; prohibiting persons of the Chinese race, and especially Chinese laborers, from coming into the United States, do not and cannot apply to him.&quot;

=== Opinion of the Court ===

In a 6–2 decision issued on March 28, 1898, the Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark had acquired U.S. citizenship at birth and that &quot;the American citizenship which Wong Kim Ark acquired by birth within the United States has not been lost or taken away by anything happening since his birth.&quot; The opinion of the Court was written by Associate Justice Horace Gray and was joined by Associate Justices David J. Brewer, Henry B. Brown, George Shiras Jr., Edward Douglass White, and Rufus W. Peckham.

The Court stated &quot;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot; should be interpreted &quot;in the light of the common law&quot; which had included as subjects virtually all native-born children, excluding only those who were born to foreign rulers or diplomats, born on foreign public ships, or born to enemy forces engaged in hostile occupation of the country&#x27;s territory. The court&#x27;s majority held that the &quot;subject to the jurisdiction&quot; phrase in the Citizenship Clause excluded from U.S. citizenship only those persons covered by one of these three exceptions (plus a fourth &quot;single additional exception&quot;—namely, that Indian tribes &quot;not taxed&quot; were not considered subject to U.S. jurisdiction). The majority concluded that none of these four exceptions to U.S. jurisdiction applied to Wong; in particular, they observed that &quot;during all the time of their said residence in the United States, as domiciled residents therein, the said mother and father of said Wong Kim Ark were engaged in the prosecution of business, and were never engaged in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China&quot;.

Quoting approvingly from an 1812 case, &quot;The Schooner Exchange v. M&#x27;Faddon&quot;, in which Chief Justice John Marshall said, &quot;The jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute&quot;—and agreeing with the district judge who had heard Wong&#x27;s original &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition that comments in the &quot;Slaughterhouse Cases&quot; about the citizenship status of children born to non-citizen parents did not constitute a binding precedent—the Court ruled that Wong was a U.S. citizen from birth, via the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the restrictions of the Chinese Exclusion Act did not apply to him. An act of Congress, they held, does not trump the Constitution; such a law &quot;cannot control [the Constitution&#x27;s] meaning, or impair its effect, but must be construed and executed in subordination to its provisions.&quot; The majority opinion referred to &quot;Calvin&#x27;s Case&quot; (1608) as stating the fundamental common law principle that all people born within the King&#x27;s &quot;allegiance&quot; were subjects, including children of &quot;aliens in amity&quot;.

=== Dissent ===

Chief Justice Melville Fuller was joined by Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan in a dissent which, &quot;for the most part, may be said to be predicated upon the recognition of the international law doctrine&quot;. The dissenters argued that the history of U.S. citizenship law had broken with English common law tradition after independence—citing as an example the embracing in the U.S. of the right of expatriation (giving up of one&#x27;s native citizenship) and the rejection of the contrary British doctrine of perpetual allegiance. The dissenters argued that the principle of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; (that is, the concept of a child inheriting his or her father&#x27;s citizenship by descent regardless of birthplace) had been more pervasive in U.S. legal history since independence. Based on an assessment of U.S. and Chinese treaty and naturalization law, the dissenters claimed that &quot;the children of Chinese born in this country do not, &quot;ipso facto&quot;, become citizens of the United States unless the fourteenth amendment overrides both treaty and statute.&quot;

Pointing to the language of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, an act of Congress which declared to be citizens &quot;all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed&quot;, and which was enacted into law only two months before the Fourteenth Amendment was proposed by Congress, the dissenters argued that &quot;it is not open to reasonable doubt that the words &#x27;subject to the jurisdiction thereof,&#x27; in the amendment, were used as synonymous with the words &#x27;and not subject to any foreign power. In the dissenters&#x27; view, excessive reliance on &quot;jus soli&quot; (birthplace) as the principal determiner of citizenship would lead to an untenable state of affairs in which &quot;the children of foreigners, happening to be born to them while passing through the country, whether of royal parentage or not, or whether of the Mongolian, Malay or other race, were eligible to the presidency, while children of our citizens, born abroad, were not.&quot;

The dissenters acknowledged that other children of foreigners—including former slaves—had, over the years, acquired U.S. citizenship through birth on U.S. soil. But they still saw a difference between those people and U.S.-born individuals of Chinese ancestry, because of strong cultural traditions discouraging Chinese immigrants from assimilating into mainstream American society, Chinese laws of the time which made renouncing allegiance to the Chinese emperor a capital crime, and the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Act making Chinese immigrants already in the United States ineligible for citizenship. The question for the dissenters was &quot;not whether [Wong Kim Ark] was born in the U.S. or subject to the jurisdiction thereof ... but whether his or her parents have the ability, under U.S. or foreign law, statutory or treaty-based, to become citizens of the U.S. themselves&quot;.

In a lecture to a group of law students shortly before the decision was released, Harlan commented that the Chinese had long been excluded from American society &quot;upon the idea that this is a race utterly foreign to us and never will assimilate with us.&quot; Without the exclusion legislation, Harlan stated his opinion that vast numbers of Chinese &quot;would have rooted out the American population&quot; in the western United States. Acknowledging the opposing view supporting citizenship for American-born Chinese, he said that &quot;Of course, the argument on the other side is that the very words of the constitution embrace such a case.&quot; Commenting on the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; case shortly after the issuance of the Court&#x27;s ruling in 1898, San Francisco attorney Marshall B. Woodworth wrote that &quot;the error the dissent apparently falls into is that it does not recognize that the United States, as a sovereign power, has the right to adopt any rule of citizenship it may see fit and that the rule of international law does not furnish [by its own force] the sole and exclusive test of citizenship of the United States&quot;.

== Subsequent developments ==

=== Contemporary reactions ===
In an analysis of the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; case written shortly after the decision in 1898, Marshall B. Woodworth laid out the two competing theories of jurisdiction in the Citizenship Clause and observed that &quot;[t]he fact that the decision of the court was not unanimous indicates that the question is at least debatable.&quot; Woodworth concluded, however, that the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling laid the issue to rest, saying that &quot;it is difficult to see what valid objection can be raised thereto&quot;. Another analysis of the case, published by the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; (1898), favored the dissenting view.

An editorial published in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; on March 30, 1898, expressed concern that the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; ruling (issued two days previously) &quot;may have a wider effect upon the question of citizenship than the public supposes&quot;—specifically, that it might lead to citizenship and voting rights not only for Chinese but also Japanese and American Indians. The editorial suggested that &quot;it may become necessary ... to amend the Federal Constitution and definitely limit citizenship to whites and blacks.&quot;

=== Impact on Wong Kim Ark&#x27;s family ===

As a result of Wong Kim Ark&#x27;s U.S. citizenship being confirmed by the Supreme Court, Wong&#x27;s eldest son, Wong Yoke Fun, came to the United States from China in 1910, seeking recognition as a citizen via &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;, but U.S. immigration officials claimed to see discrepancies in the testimony at his immigration hearing and refused to accept Wong&#x27;s claim that the boy was his son. Wong&#x27;s other three sons came to the United States between 1924 and 1926 and were accepted as citizens. Because of his citizenship, Wong Kim Ark&#x27;s youngest son was drafted in World War II, and later made a career in the United States Merchant Marine.

=== Citizenship law since &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; ===

Current U.S. law on birthright citizenship (citizenship acquired at birth) acknowledges both citizenship through place of birth (&quot;jus soli&quot;) and citizenship inherited from parents (&quot;jus sanguinis&quot;). Before &quot;Wong Kim Ark,&quot; the Supreme Court had held in &quot;Elk v. Wilkins&quot; (1884) that birthplace by itself was not sufficient to grant citizenship to a Native American; however, Congress eventually granted full citizenship to Native Americans via the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.

Restrictions on immigration and naturalization of Chinese were eventually lifted as a consequence of the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943 (also known as the Magnuson Act) and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.

=== &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; and later cases ===
In the years since &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot;, the concept of &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship has &quot;never been seriously questioned by the Supreme Court, and [has] been accepted as dogma by lower courts&quot;. Citizenship cases since &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; have dealt mainly with situations falling outside the bounds of the Citizenship Clause—such as citizenship via &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; for foreign-born children of U.S. citizens, or circumstances under which U.S. citizenship may be lost.

The &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; court&#x27;s affirmation of &quot;jus soli&quot; as the primary rule determining United States citizenship has been cited in several Supreme Court decisions affirming the citizenship of U.S.-born individuals of Chinese or Japanese ancestry. The court&#x27;s holding that the language of the Constitution should be understood in light of the common law has been cited in numerous Supreme Court decisions dealing with the interpretation of the Constitution or acts of Congress. The &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; court&#x27;s understanding of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction was also cited in a 1982 case involving the rights of illegal immigrants.

An unsuccessful effort was made in 1942 by the Native Sons of the Golden West to convince the Supreme Court to revisit and overrule the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; ruling, in a case (&quot;Regan v. King&quot;) challenging the citizenship status of roughly 2,600 U.S.-born persons of Japanese ancestry. The plaintiffs&#x27; attorney termed &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; &quot;one of the most injurious and unfortunate decisions&quot; ever handed down by the Supreme Court and hoped the new case would give the court &quot;an opportunity to correct itself&quot;. A federal district court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals summarily rejected this contention, each citing &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; as a controlling precedent, and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

Federal appellate courts have repeatedly rejected attempts to cite the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; opinion&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;citizenship by birth within the territory&quot; in support of claims that persons born in the Philippines during the period of its history when it was a United States possession were born in the U.S. (and thus entitled to U.S. citizenship via the Citizenship Clause).

=== &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; and children of illegal immigrants ===

Since the 1990s, controversy has arisen in some circles over the practice of granting automatic citizenship via &quot;jus soli&quot; to U.S.-born children of illegal aliens—controversially dubbed the &quot;anchor baby&quot; situation by some media correspondents and advocacy groups. Public debate over the issue has resulted in renewed discussion of the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; decision.

Some legal scholars, opposed to the idea that &quot;jus soli&quot; should apply to the children of illegal aliens, have argued that the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; precedent does not apply when alien parents are in the country illegally. John C. Eastman, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, has argued that &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; does not entitle U.S.-born children of illegal aliens to gain automatic citizenship because, in his opinion, being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States requires a status of &quot;full and complete jurisdiction&quot; that does not apply to aliens who are in the country illegally. Eastman further argues that the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; decision was fundamentally flawed in the way it dealt with the concept of jurisdiction, and that the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924—which followed &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot;—would not have been necessary if Congress had believed &quot;that the Citizenship Clause confers citizenship merely by accident of birth.&quot; A similar analysis of the jurisdiction question has been proposed by Professor Peter H. Schuck of the Yale School of Law and Rogers M. Smith, political science professor at Yale. According to law professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas, even if &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; settled the status of children of legal residents, it did not do so for children of illegal residents; Graglia asserts that the case weighs against automatic birthright for illegal immigrants because the Court denied such citizenship for an analogous group, namely &quot;children of alien enemies, born during and within their hostile occupation&quot;.

Countering this view, Garrett Epps—a professor of law at the University of Baltimore—has stated that &quot;In the case of &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot;, the United States Supreme Court held that this guarantee [of birthright citizenship] applies to children of foreigners present on American soil, even if their parents are not American citizens and indeed are not eligible to become U.S. citizens.&quot; Epps further notes that &quot;as a practical matter, the American-born children receive recognition of their citizenship regardless of the immigration status of their parents.&quot; In Epps&#x27; opinion, the sponsors of the Fourteenth Amendment &quot;were unwavering in their insistence that the Citizenship Clause was to cover&quot; the children of such &quot;undesirable immigrants&quot; as Chinese and Gypsies, and he views the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; ruling as an &quot;unexceptionable&quot; matter of reading the drafters&#x27; intent.

Judge James C. Ho, appointed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018, has expressed a similar view to that of Rodriguez, saying that &quot;Birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. That birthright is protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers.&quot; Ho also argues that those who claim the Citizenship Clause was not in fact intended to confer citizenship on the children of aliens are disregarding the substance of the 1866 Senate debate over the proposal to add this language to the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s 1982 &quot;Plyler v. Doe&quot; decision—in a case involving illegal alien children (i.e., children born abroad who had come to the United States illegally along with their parents, and who had no basis for claiming U.S. citizenship)—has also been cited in support of a broad application of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction to illegal aliens and their children. A Texas state law had sought to deny such children a public education, and the Texas government had argued that &quot;persons who have entered the United States illegally are not &#x27;within the jurisdiction&#x27; of a State even if they are present within a State&#x27;s boundaries and subject to its laws.&quot; A &quot;dictum&quot; footnote in the Court&#x27;s majority opinion remarked that according to &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot;, the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s phrases &quot;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot; (in the Citizenship Clause) and &quot;within its jurisdiction&quot; (in the Equal Protection Clause) were essentially equivalent; that both expressions referred primarily to physical presence and not to political allegiance; and that the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; decision benefited the children of illegal as well as legal aliens. As a result, the court rejected the claim that Fourteenth Amendment &quot;jurisdiction&quot; depended on whether someone had entered the U.S. legally or not. Although the four dissenting justices disagreed with the opinion of the Court regarding whether the children in question had a right to a public education, the dissenters agreed with the majority regarding the applicability of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction to illegal aliens. James C. Ho considers &quot;Plyler v. Doe&quot; to have &quot;put to rest&quot; any doubt over whether the sweeping language regarding jurisdiction in &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; applies to all aliens, even illegal aliens.

The United States Department of State (the federal government agency responsible for international relations) considers U.S.-born children of illegal aliens to be subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and thus to have citizenship at birth. The State Department&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Manual takes the position that this issue was settled by the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; ruling.

Some legal scholars still argue that the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; ruling should be overturned through legislative means. Richard Posner, a judge of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, criticized (in 2003) the granting of citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, suggesting that Congress can and should act to change this policy. Charles Wood, former counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee&#x27;s subcommittee on immigration, has also opposed the practice, urging (in 1999) that it be stopped as quickly as possible, either by an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment.

However, in the words of Lucy Salyer, &quot;the birthright citizenship doctrine of &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; has remained intact for over a century, still perceived by most to be a natural and well-established rule in accordance with American principles and practice. It is unlikely to be uprooted easily.&quot;

=== Legislative and executive attempts to overturn &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; ===
In response to public reaction against immigration and fears that U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants could serve as links to permit legal residency and eventual citizenship for family members who would otherwise be ineligible to remain in the country, bills have been introduced from time to time in Congress which have challenged the conventional interpretation of the Citizenship Clause and have sought (thus far unsuccessfully) to actively and explicitly deny citizenship at birth to U.S.-born children of foreign visitors or illegal aliens.

As one example among many, the &quot;Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009&quot;—introduced in the House of Representatives of the 111th Congress as H.R. 1868, by Representative Nathan Deal of Georgia—was an attempt to exclude U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants from being considered subject to the jurisdiction of the United States for purposes of the Citizenship Clause. A similar proposal—named the &quot;Birthright Citizenship Act of 2011&quot;—was introduced in the House as H.R. 140 in the (112th) Congress on January 5, 2011 by Representative Steve King of Iowa, and in the Senate as S. 723 on April 5, 2011 by Senator David Vitter of Louisiana. Neither bill was discussed in Congress prior to the end of the session.

Since an act of Congress challenging the accepted interpretation of the Citizenship Clause might very possibly be ruled unconstitutional by courts choosing to rely on &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; as a precedent, proposals have also been made to amend the Constitution so as to override the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s language and deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal aliens or foreign visitors. For example, Vitter introduced Senate Joint Resolution (S.J.Res.) 6 in the 111th Congress, but like H.R. 1868, it failed to reach the floor of either house of Congress before the 111th Congress adjourned on December 22, 2010. Vitter reintroduced this same proposed amendment as S.J.Res. 2 in the 112th Congress on January 25, 2011; it was not brought up for discussion or voted upon in either house of Congress.

In 2010 and 2011, state legislators in Arizona introduced bills proposing to deny regular birth certificates to children born in Arizona whose parents could not prove they were in the United States legally. Supporters of such legislation reportedly hoped their efforts would cause the issue of birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal aliens to reach the Supreme Court, possibly resulting in a new decision narrowing or overruling &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot;.

On October 30, 2018, President Donald Trump announced his intention to issue an executive order abolishing birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of non-citizens. On this same date, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he would introduce legislation in Congress to accomplish the same thing. Jon Feere, of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), has said that &quot;Several legal scholars and political scientists who have delved into the history of the 14th Amendment have concluded that &#x27;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#x27; has no plain meaning&quot;. Commenting on Trump&#x27;s idea of an executive order, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said &quot;you obviously cannot do that... I think in this case the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process.&quot; Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said that if Trump follows through on his plan, &quot;This will set up the court fight... the order will be enjoined, [and the] case will eventually reach [the Supreme Court], which then will finally have to rule on the meaning of &#x27;subject to the jurisdiction&#x27;.&quot; Neither Trump&#x27;s promised executive order nor Graham&#x27;s planned bill materialized before Trump left office in January 2021.

However, upon assuming office on January 20, 2025, Trump announced an executive order abolishing birthright citizenship for anyone born in the United States without a mother or father that was a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. As of January 22, at least two federal court challenges have been filed against the executive order, one in Massachusetts by more than 20 state attorneys general led by Matthew Platkin, &quot;State of New Jersey, et al. v. Trump&quot;, and one in New Hampshire by the American Civil Liberties Union, &quot;New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al. v. Trump&quot;. Norman Wong, the great-grandson of Wong Kim Ark, criticized the executive order.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Epigoni or Epigonoi (; from , meaning &quot;offspring&quot;) are the sons of the Argive heroes, the Seven against Thebes, who had fought and been killed in the first Theban war, the subject of the &quot;Thebaid&quot;, in which Polynices and his allies attacked Thebes because Polynices&#x27; brother, Eteocles, refused to give up the throne as promised. The second Theban war, also called the war of the Epigoni, occurred ten years later, when the Epigoni, wishing to avenge the death of their fathers, attacked Thebes.

== List of Epigoni ==
According to the mythographer Apollodorus, they were:
* Aegialeus, son of Adrastus
* Alcmaeon, son of Amphiaraus
* Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus
* Diomedes, son of Tydeus
* Euryalus, son of Mecisteus
* Promachus, son of Parthenopaeus
* Sthenelus, son of Capaneus
*Thersander, son of Polynices

To this list, the geographer Pausanias also adds:
* Polydorus, son of Hippomedon
* Adrastus and Timeas, sons of Polynices

Hyginus also makes note of:
* Biantes and Tlesimenes, sons of Parthenopaeus
== The war ==
Both Apollodorus and Pausanias tell the story of the war of the Epigoni, although their accounts differ in several respects. According to Apollodorus, the Delphic oracle had promised victory if Alcmaeon was chosen their leader, and so he was. Aegialeus was killed by Laodamas, son of Eteocles, but Alcmaeon killed Laodamas. The Thebans were defeated and, by the counsel of the seer Teiresias, fled their city. However, Pausanias says that Thersander was their leader, that Laodamas fled Thebes with the rest of the Thebans, and that Thersander became king of Thebes.

== As a poetic theme ==
&quot;Epigoni&quot; was an early Greek epic on this subject; it formed a sequel to the &quot;Thebaid&quot; and therefore was grouped by Alexandrian critics in the Theban cycle. Some counted it not as a separate poem but as the last part of the &quot;Thebaid&quot;. Only the first line is now known:

:Now, Muses, let us begin to sing of younger men ...

&quot;Epigoni&quot; was a lost Greek tragedy by Sophocles. A few lines from this text have long been known because they were quoted in commentaries and lexica by ancient scholars. An additional fragment of several lines was discovered in 2005.

== In art ==
There were statues of the Epigoni at Argos and Delphi.

<text>WODC (93.3 FM) – branded as 93.3 The Bus – is a commercial classic hits radio station licensed to Ashville, Ohio, serving Columbus and the Columbus metro area. Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., the WODC studios are located in Downtown Columbus, while its transmitter resides near Obetz. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WODC broadcasts over three HD Radio channels, and streams online via iHeartRadio.

==History==
=== Early years (1961–2004) ===
Originally located at 94.3 FM, WFCB was called &quot;WFCB-94.3&quot;, but to clear a 2002 move from Chillicothe to Ashville, frequencies were to be exchanged between WFCB and WKKJ. WKKJ was a sister Clear Channel station also in Chillicothe, but operating at 93.3 MHz, playing country music. After the switch, WFCB was re-imaged as &quot;Mix 93.3&quot;, but continued to run and be staffed from Chillicothe.

=== Adult contemporary (2004–2011) ===
When WFCB&#x27;s transmitter was officially moved to Obetz on January 1, 2004, the station was flipped to &quot;93.3 Lite FM&quot; and the calls were changed to WLZT. The positioner eventually transitioned from &quot;93.3 Lite FM&quot; to &quot;93.3 WLZT&quot; when the station switched to a more gold-based adult contemporary or classic hits format. After several musical changes, the station re-imaged as &quot;Soft Rock 93.3&quot; in May 2010.

=== Classic hits (2011–2015) ===
On September 2, 2011, on Labor Day weekend, the station began stunting with &quot;America&#x27;s Top 500.&quot; The following Tuesday at 9 a.m., following the holiday, after playing &quot;American Pie&quot; by Don McLean, the station switched to classic hits as &quot;Oldies 93.3.&quot; On September 29, 2011, the callsign was changed from WLZT to WODC. In February 2014, 1980s music was added and the &quot;Oldies 93.3&quot; moniker was dropped, and was rebranded as &quot;93.3 WODC.&quot;

=== Adult hits (2015–2021) ===
At midnight on December 28, 2015, WODC relaunched with an adult hits format, and rebranded as &quot;93.3 The Bus&quot;.

From March 2016 to September 2020, WODC did an &quot;All-80s Lunch commercial-Free Lunch Hour&quot; from 12-1pm Monday thru Friday.

From July 2016 to September 2020, WODC did three short segments Monday thru Friday, &quot;It Came from the 80&#x27;s&quot; highlighting three different songs from a certain year at 8am, &quot;Icons at 11am&quot; at 11am featuring three songs from a single artist and &quot;3-Play at 3, where three songs from a certain topic was played.

Between July 2016 and September 2023, mostly on holiday weekends that started on Friday and end on Monday (Memorial Day and Labor Day), WODC did an &quot;All-80&#x27;s Weekend&quot;.

=== Classic hits (2021–present) ===
In August 2021, WODC repositioned itself as “Columbus’ Classic Hits” and added on-air staff, while retaining the “Bus” branding. The station transitioned back to a classic hits format, with a more focused playlist on music from the 1970s through 1990s.

Every year from early-mid November to December 25th, WODC flips the switch and plays continuous Christmas music.

Monday thru Friday, WODC does a &quot;Commercial Free drive home&quot; music block hosted by Kelsey Webb, from WNCI&#x27;s Morning Zoo, for 93 minutes from 3:50 thru about 5:15pm and an &quot;All-80s Lunch&quot; (since April 3, 2023) from 12-1pm playing nothing but songs from the 1980s.

In late January 2022, WODC brought back Casey Kasem&#x27;s &quot;American Top 40&quot; every Sunday mornings from 8am to 12 noon. The station previously aired the show with episodes from the 70s and 80s on Sunday mornings from April 2011 to February 2019.

In September 2024, WODC teamed up with the Columbus Blue Jackets to broadcast a select number of Columbus Blue Jackets hockey games whenever its main partner, WBNS-FM (97.1 The Fan) is unavailable to cover a Columbus Blue Jackets hockey game due to Ohio State sporting (Football or Basketball) game committment.

In February 2025, WODC brought back &quot;The 80&#x27;s Show with Jeff Stevens&quot; every Saturday night from 7pm to 12 midnight. The station previously aired the show on Sunday evenings from May 2017 to February 2019 with occasional airings between September 2019 and September 2020 during the stations&#x27;All-80&#x27;s Weekend&quot;.

<text>A bipolar violation, bipolarity violation, or BPV, is a violation of the bipolar encoding rules where two pulses of the same polarity occur without an intervening pulse of the opposite polarity. This indicates an error in the transmission of the signal.

T-carrier and E-carrier signals are transmitted using a scheme called bipolar encoding, a.k.a. Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI), where ONE is represented by a pulse, and a ZERO is represented by no pulse. Pulses (which represent ones) always alternate in polarity, so that if, for example two positive pulses are received in succession, the receiver knows that an error occurred (a violation) in that one or more bits were either added or deleted from the original signal.

Reliable transmission of data using this scheme requires a regular stream of pulses; too many zero bits in succession can cause a loss of synchronization between transmitter and receiver. To ensure that this is always present, there exist a number of modified AMI codes which use judiciously placed bipolar violations to encode long strings of consecutive zeroes.

<doc id="637512" wikidata="Q202013" url="?curid=637512" title="Nosebleed">
<text>A nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is an instance of bleeding from the nose. Blood can flow down into the stomach, and cause nausea and vomiting. In more severe cases, blood may come out of both nostrils. Rarely, bleeding may be so significant that low blood pressure occurs. Blood may also be forced to flow up and through the nasolacrimal duct and out of the eye, producing bloody tears.
Risk factors include trauma, including putting the finger in the nose, blood thinners, high blood pressure, alcoholism, seasonal allergies, dry weather, and inhaled corticosteroids. There are two types: anterior, which is more common; and posterior, which is less common but more serious. Anterior nosebleeds generally occur from Kiesselbach&#x27;s plexus while posterior bleeds generally occur from the sphenopalatine artery or Woodruff&#x27;s plexus. The diagnosis is by direct observation.
Prevention may include the use of petroleum jelly in the nose. Initially, treatment is generally the application of pressure for at least five minutes over the lower half of the nose. If this is not sufficient, nasal packing may be used. Tranexamic acid may also be helpful. If bleeding episodes continue, endoscopy is recommended.
About 60% of people have a nosebleed at some point in their life. About 10% of nosebleeds are serious. Nosebleeds are rarely fatal, accounting for only 4 of the 2.4 million deaths in the U.S. in 1999. Nosebleeds most commonly affect those younger than 10 and older than 50.
== Cause ==

Nosebleeds can occur due to a variety of reasons. Some of the most common causes include trauma from nose picking, blunt trauma (such as a motor vehicle accident), or insertion of a foreign object (more likely in children). Low relative humidity (such as in centrally heated buildings), respiratory tract infections, chronic sinusitis, rhinitis or environmental irritants can cause inflammation and thinning of the tissue in the nose, leading to a greater likelihood of bleeding from the nose.

Most causes of nose bleeding are self-limiting and do not require medical attention. However, if nosebleeds are recurrent or do not respond to home therapies, an underlying cause may need to be investigated. Some rarer causes are listed below:

Coagulopathy
* Thrombocytopenia (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura)
* Von Willebrand&#x27;s disease
* Hemophilia
* Leukemia
* HIV
* Chronic liver disease—cirrhosis causes deficiency of factor II, VII, IX,&amp; X

Dietary
* Sulfur dioxide (sulphur dioxide) E220 (as a food preservative used particularly in wines, dried fruits, etc. )
* Sulphites as food preservatives
* Salicylates naturally occurring in some fruits and vegetables

Inflammatory
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
* Systemic lupus erythematosus

Medications/Drugs
* Anticoagulation (warfarin, heparin, aspirin, etc.)
* Insufflated drugs (particularly cocaine)
* Nasal sprays (particularly prolonged or improper use of nasal steroids)

Neoplastic
* Squamous cell carcinoma
* Adenoid cystic carcinoma
* Melanoma
* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
* Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
* Nosebleeds can be a sign of cancer in the sinus area, which is rare, or tumors starting at the base of the brain, such as meningioma. Due to the sensitive location, nosebleeds caused by tumors are typically associated with other symptoms, such as hearing or vision problems.

Traumatic
* Anatomical deformities (&quot;e.g.&quot; septal spurs)
* Blunt trauma (usually a sharp blow to the face such as a punch, sometimes accompanying a nasal fracture)
* Foreign bodies (such as fingers during nose-picking)
* Digital trauma (nose picking)
* Middle ear barotrauma (such as from descent in aircraft or ascent in scuba diving)
* Nasal bone fracture
* Septal fracture/perforation
* Intranasal tumors (&quot;e.g.&quot; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma or nasopharyngeal angiofibroma)
* Nasal cannula O2 (tending to dry the olfactory mucosa)
* Nasal sprays (particularly prolonged or improper use of nasal steroids)
* Surgery (&quot;e.g.&quot; septoplasty and functional endoscopic sinus surgery)
* Leech infestation
* Nasal bleeds may be due to fracture of facial bones namely maxilla and zygoma.

Vascular
* Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler–Weber–Rendu disease)
* Angioma
* Aneurysm of the carotid artery

== Pathophysiology ==

The nasal mucosa contains a rich blood supply that can be easily ruptured and cause bleeding. Rupture may be spontaneous or initiated by trauma. Nosebleeds are reported in up to 60% of the population with peak incidences in those under the age of ten and over the age of 50 and appear to occur in males more than females. An increase in blood pressure (e.g. due to general hypertension) tends to increase the duration of spontaneous epistaxis. Anticoagulant medication and disorders of blood clotting can promote and prolong bleeding. Spontaneous epistaxis is more common in the elderly as the nasal mucosa (lining) becomes dry and thin and blood pressure tends to be higher. The elderly are also more prone to prolonged nosebleeds as their blood vessels are less able to constrict and control the bleeding.

The vast majority of nosebleeds occur in the front anterior (front) part of the nose from the nasal septum. This area is richly endowed with blood vessels (Kiesselbach&#x27;s plexus). This region is also known as Little&#x27;s area. Bleeding farther back in the nose is known as a posterior bleed and is usually due to bleeding from Woodruff&#x27;s plexus, a venous plexus situated in the posterior part of inferior meatus. Posterior bleeds are often prolonged and difficult to control. They can be associated with bleeding from both nostrils and with a greater flow of blood into the mouth.

 Sometimes blood flowing from other sources of bleeding passes through the nasal cavity and exits the nostrils. It is thus blood coming from the nose but is not a true nosebleed, that is, not truly originating from the nasal cavity. Such bleeding is called &quot;pseudoepistaxis&quot; (&quot;&quot; + &quot;epistaxis&quot;). Examples include blood coughed up through the airway and ending up in the nasal cavity, then dripping out.

==Prevention==

People with uncomplicated nosebleeds can use conservative methods to prevent future nosebleeds such as sleeping in a humidified environment or applying petroleum jelly to the nasal nares.

Individuals who suffer from nosebleeds regularly, especially children, are encouraged to use over-the-counter nasal saline sprays and avoid vigorous nose-blowing as preventative measures.

== Treatment ==
Most anterior nosebleeds can be stopped by applying direct pressure, which helps by promoting blood clots. Those who have a nosebleed should first attempt to blow out any blood clots and then apply pressure to the soft anterior part of the nose (by pinching the nasal ala; not the bony nasal bridge) for at least five minutes and up to 30 minutes. Pressure should be firm and tilting the head forward helps decrease the chance of nausea and airway obstruction due to blood dripping into the airway. When attempting to stop a nosebleed at home, the head should not be tilted back. Swallowing excess blood can irritate the stomach and cause vomiting. Vasoconstrictive medications such as oxymetazoline (Afrin) or phenylephrine are widely available over the counter for treatment of allergic rhinitis and may also be used to control benign cases of epistaxis. For example, a few sprays of oxymetazoline may be applied into the bleeding side(s) of the nose followed by application of direct pressure. Those with nosebleeds that last longer than 30 minutes (despite use of direct pressure and vasoconstrictive medications such as oxymetazoline) should seek medical attention.

=== Chemical cauterization ===
This method involves applying a chemical such as silver nitrate to the nasal mucosa, which burns and seals off the bleeding. Eventually the nasal tissue to which the chemical is applied will undergo necrosis. This form of treatment is best for mild bleeds, especially in children, that are clearly visible. A topical anesthetic (such as lidocaine) is usually applied prior to cauterization. Silver nitrate can cause blackening of the skin due to silver sulfide deposit, though this will fade with time. Once the silver nitrate is deposited, saline may be used to neutralize any excess silver nitrate via formation of silver chloride precipitate.

=== Nasal packing ===
If pressure and chemical cauterization cannot stop bleeding, nasal packing is the mainstay of treatment. Nasal packing is typically categorized into anterior nasal packing and posterior nasal packing. Nasal packing may also be categorized into dissolvable and non-dissolvable types.

Dissolvable nasal packing materials stop bleeding through use of thrombotic agents that promote blood clots, such as surgicel and gelfoam. The thrombogenic foams and gels do not require removal and dissolve after a few days. Typically, dissolvable nasal packing is first attempted; if the bleeding persists, non-dissolvable nasal packing is the next option.

Traditionally, nasal packing was accomplished by packing gauze into the nose, thereby placing pressure on the vessels in the nose and stopping the bleeding. Traditional gauze packing has been replaced with other non-dissolvable nasal packing products such as Merocel and the Rapid Rhino. The Merocel nasal tampon is similar to gauze packing except it is a synthetic foam polymer (made of polyvinyl alcohol and expands in the nose after application of water) that provides a less hospitable medium for bacteria. The Rapid Rhino stops nosebleeds using a balloon catheter, made of carboxymethylcellulose, which has a cuff that is inflated by air to stop bleeding through extra pressure in the nasal cavity. Systematic review articles have demonstrated that the efficacy in stopping nosebleeds is similar between the Rapid Rhino and Merocel packs; however, the Rapid Rhino has been shown to have greater ease of insertion and reduced discomfort. Posterior nasal packing can be achieved by using a Foley catheter, blowing up the balloon when it is in the back of the throat, and applying anterior traction so that the inflated balloon occludes the choanae. Patients who receive non-dissolvable nasal packing need to return to a medical professional in 24–72 hours in order to have packing removed. Complications of non-dissolvable nasal packing include abscesses, septal hematomas, sinusitis, and pressure necrosis. In rare cases toxic shock syndrome can occur with prolonged nasal packing. As a result, any patient who has non-dissolvable nasal packing should be given prophylactic antibiotic medication to be taken as long as the nasal packing remains in the nose.

===Surgery===
Ongoing bleeding despite good nasal packing is a surgical emergency and can be treated by endoscopic evaluation of the nasal cavity under general anesthesia to identify an elusive bleeding point or to directly ligate (tie off) the blood vessels supplying the nose. These blood vessels include the sphenopalatine, anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries. More rarely the maxillary or a branch of the external carotid artery can be ligated. The bleeding can also be stopped by intra-arterial embolization using a catheter placed in the groin and threaded up the aorta to the bleeding vessel by an interventional radiologist. There is no difference in outcomes between embolization and ligation as treatment options, but embolization is considerably more expensive. Continued bleeding may be an indication of more serious underlying conditions.

=== Tranexamic acid ===
Tranexamic acid helps promote blood clotting. For nosebleeds it can be applied to the site of bleeding, taken by mouth, or injected into a vein.

=== Other ===
The utility of local cooling of the head and neck is controversial. Some state that applying ice to the nose or forehead is not useful. Others feel that it may promote vasoconstriction of the nasal blood vessels and thus be useful. In Indonesian traditional medicine, betel leaf is used to stop nosebleeds as it contains tannin which causes blood to coagulate, thus stopping active bleeding.

==Society and culture==
In the visual language of Japanese manga and anime, nosebleeding often indicates that the bleeding person is sexually aroused. In Western fiction, nosebleeds often signify intense mental focus or effort, particularly during the use of psychic powers.

In American and Canadian usage, &quot;nosebleed section&quot; and &quot;nosebleed seats&quot; are common slang for seating at sporting or other spectator events that are the highest up and farthest away from the event. The reference alludes to the propensity for nasal hemorrhage at high altitudes, usually owing to lower barometric pressure.

The oral history of the Native American Sioux tribe includes reference to women who experience nosebleeds as a result of a lover&#x27;s playing of music, implying sexual arousal.

In the Finnish language, &quot;picking blood from one&#x27;s nose&quot; and &quot;begging for a nosebleed&quot; are commonly used in abstract meaning to describe self-destructive behaviour, for example ignoring safety procedures or deliberately aggravating stronger parties.

In Filipino slang, to &quot;have a nosebleed&quot; is to have serious difficulty conversing in English with a fluent or native English speaker. It can also refer to anxiety brought on by a stressful event such as an examination or a job interview.

In the Dutch language, &quot;pretending to have a nosebleed&quot; is a saying that means pretending not to know anything about something.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;epistaxis&quot; is from &quot;epistazo&quot;, &quot;to bleed from the nose&quot; from &quot;epi&quot;, &quot;above, over&quot; and &quot;stazo&quot;, &quot;to drip [from the nostrils]&quot;.

<text>The Los Angeles Express were a team in the United States Football League (USFL) based in Los Angeles, California. Playing at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Express competed in all three of the USFL seasons played between 1983 and 1985.

==History==

Cable television pioneers Alan Harmon and Bill Daniels were awarded a USFL franchise for San Diego when the league announced its formation in 1982. However, the city refused to grant the team a lease to play at Jack Murphy Stadium under pressure from the stadium&#x27;s existing tenants—baseball&#x27;s Padres, the NFL&#x27;s Chargers, and the NASL&#x27;s Sockers. The only other outdoor facility available in the area was Balboa Stadium, the original home of the Chargers. However, it was a relatively antiquated facility (built in 1915) that had not had a major tenant since the Chargers moved into Jack Murphy in 1967, and was now largely used by high school teams. This was an untenable situation for a team that was aspiring to be part of a major sports league.

With only eight months before the season was to start, Harmon and Daniels decided to move to Los Angeles with the league&#x27;s blessing. League officials believed that Harmon and Daniels&#x27; ties to the cable industry could help the league get exposure; David Dixon&#x27;s blueprint for the league depended heavily on television coverage. They forced Jim Joseph, second owner of the Los Angeles USFL franchise, to give up his rights to Los Angeles in favor of Harmon and Daniels. Joseph relocated his franchise to Phoenix, Arizona as the Arizona Wranglers.

===1983 season===

The Los Angeles Express drafted Dan Marino as the first pick in USFL history. Marino made some appearances on behalf of the Express before signing with the Miami Dolphins.

The Express also made a serious run at Eric Dickerson, and actually matched the Los Angeles Rams&#x27; offer for him. However, Dickerson signed with the Rams, apparently because family members were skeptical about the USFL.

Television star Lee Majors became part owner in April 1983.

The Express ownership lured Canadian Football League legend Hugh Campbell, head coach of the Edmonton Eskimos, to be their first head coach. (Campbell had taken over the Eskimos in 1977 and in his six years had taken the team to six straight Grey Cup games, winning the last five.)

The 1983 Express team was a competitive team headed by quarterbacks Tom Ramsey and Mike Rae and led by an above average defense. Despite losing two defensive backs to knee injuries, the Express finished fifth in the league in total defense.

However, a patchwork offensive line limited the team&#x27;s offensive firepower. The Express had the worst rushing attack in the league. Herschel Walker rushed for 72 more yards than the entire Express team in 1983. Despite this, the Pacific Division was so weak that the Express were actually in contention for the division title with two weeks to go in the season. However, upset losses to the New Jersey Generals and Washington Federals in weeks 16 and 17 respectively cost the Express the Pacific Division title and allowed the Oakland Invaders to claim the last 1983 playoff berth.

Southern Californians viewed the Express largely with indifference. They only drew 19,000 people per game, failing to top 17,000 in their last four games. The crowds looked even smaller than that due to the cavernous size of the Coliseum, which seated almost 95,000 people at the time, far and away the largest stadium in pro football. However, it was far too big for an NFL team (the Los Angeles Raiders, and the Rams before them, were plagued with local blackouts even in their best years), let alone a USFL team. It was so spread out that even crowds of 25,000 —a decent-sized crowd by USFL standards— were swallowed up in the environment.

While Harmon and Daniels knew that the Express were going to be a hard sell, the poor gate surprised even them. Additionally, television ratings for USFL games in the Los Angeles market were so low that they significantly held down the league&#x27;s average television ratings.

===1984 season===
Harmon and Daniels grew alarmed at their fellow owners&#x27; increasingly reckless spending. They had also tired of commuting from their base in Denver to Los Angeles for games. They put the Express up for sale, and found a buyer in mortgage banker J. William Oldenburg, who bought the team for $7.5 million. Soon after taking over, Oldenburg hired veteran NFL executive Don Klosterman as general manager and former Chargers and Los Angeles Rams quarterback John Hadl as head coach.

Oldenburg told Klosterman that money was no object, and he was to sign the best 40-man roster he could find. As Klosterman put it, Oldenburg wanted to &quot;design a car to go 180 miles an hour.&quot; Klosterman signed 31 players in two months for a total of $12 million. Among other things, he spent a total of $8 million to sign four of the best offensive linemen in college football, giving the Express the most expensive offensive line in all of professional football. One of the new signees, kicker Tony Zendejas, recalled being stunned at the number of luxury cars in the players&#x27; parking lot.

Klosterman and Oldenburg&#x27;s biggest prize was Steve Young, a quarterback who had played at the namesake university of his lineal ancestor, Brigham Young University. Agent Leigh Steinberg negotiated for Young what was then reported to be the largest professional sports contract ever signed – a 10-year deal worth over US$40 million. The payments were to be in the form of an annuity set up to pay him $1 million annually for the next 42 years, so the value of the contract was considerably less than stated.

The NFL also noticed the Express&#x27; stockpiling of talent: in the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL players, no fewer than twenty Express players were picked, including four of the first six selections and eleven in just the opening round. But despite the all-star lineup, the team struggled to compete with the popularity of the Raiders (who had just won the Super Bowl) and the Rams: the Express only drew 15,361 people per game, down from 19,713 a year earlier. On three occasions, the team drew crowds of fewer than 11,000 people. Largely due to the poor attendance, they reportedly lost $15 million.

In spite of its overwhelming talent and one of the league&#x27;s highest payrolls, the young team struggled with adjusting to the pro game and several injuries, losing their first four home games and only finishing two games over .500 at 10–8; however, this was enough to tie the Wranglers for first place in the Pacific Division. The Express won the division title on a tiebreaker, and got to play the Michigan Panthers, who had limped into the playoffs with a 4–8 record in their last 12 games since losing star wide receiver Anthony Carter for the season, while Arizona got Jim Kelly&#x27;s red hot 13–5 Houston Gamblers. The playoff game against the Panthers drew only 7,964 fans, which looked tiny in the huge Coliseum. As it turned out, the contest was the longest in professional football history: a three-overtime, 93 minute and 33 second marathon won by the Express 27–21 on a touchdown run by Mel Gray. (This proved painful for both teams: Gray broke his arm on the play, and the Panthers never played again, merging over the winter with the Oakland Invaders.)

The Wranglers upset the Gamblers 17–16 on a late rally, which normally would have given the Express the right to host the conference championship game against the Wranglers. But since the Coliseum was being readied for the 1984 Summer Olympics, the game was shifted to the Wranglers&#x27; home, Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona. However, moving the game created another problem: with daytime temperatures in Arizona well above 100 degrees on that July day, local doctors and other officials implored the league to move the contest to nighttime, which they did. Unfortunately, this meant the game would be aired starting at 11:30pm on the east coast, which didn&#x27;t exactly help TV ratings (and, even after sundown, temps were still in the nineties at game time). League officials were nonetheless relieved when the game attracted a solid crowd of 33,188, which would have looked extremely sparse in the Coliseum. (Arizona won, 35–23, and advanced to the USFL title game, which they lost to Philadelphia.)

===Offseason disaster===
Then, just as quickly as the Express rose, they fell. Midway through the season, the FBI began investigating Oldenburg&#x27;s financial dealings. Multiple exposés by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed Oldenburg not only had a habit of luring savings and loans into questionable deals, but was also nowhere near as well off as he had long claimed.

In its bid to gain credibility with the sporting public, the USFL stressed that it required potential owners to undergo an exhaustive due diligence and meet strict capitalization requirements. However, it emerged that the owners largely dispensed with these normal procedures after the 1983 season, largely because as they were determined to expand the league to eighteen teams. The league was also desperate to ensure an apparently solid owner in the nation&#x27;s second-largest market. With Oldenburg as the only credible bidder for the Express after Harmon and Daniels pulled out, the league only conducted a cursory review of his finances. While Oldenburg had gained a reputation as the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of the league, no one even suspected that he was a fraud until the FBI and newspaper investigations revealed that he had virtually no money. When he applied to buy the Express, he claimed to have net worth of $100 million, which on paper would have given him more than enough net worth to buy the team. Subsequent investigations suggested that much of that figure came from buying a piece of property for a discount, then selling it to a small bank that he owned for ten times its actual worth.

Late in the season, just days after the &quot;Times&quot; article, Oldenburg told league officials that he could no longer afford to pay the Express&#x27; bills. The league required all owners to post a $1.3 million letter of credit for just such an emergency; it tapped into the Express&#x27; letter of credit to cover expenses. The owners also agreed to chip in $500,000 to keep the team going through the playoffs. Even this wasn&#x27;t enough to prevent their equipment from being confiscated after the Western Conference title game because Oldenburg had failed to pay an equipment company $13,000. By the time that Oldenburg walked away from the team, office employees and landscaping contractors were going unpaid.

Real estate magnate and Houston Gamblers minority owner Jay Roulier got preliminary approval to take over the team in October. Despite this, the turmoil surrounding the Express led league insiders and reporters to wonder when, not if, the team would implode, even with the trove of talent on the roster. The expected implosion happened in February 1985, when Roulier&#x27;s lawyer sounded wary about discussing her boss&#x27;s finances with league executive director and general counsel Bill McSherry. Suspecting that Roulier was less than advertised, league officials launched an investigation. It turned out that Roulier, like Oldenburg, had deceived league officials about his net worth. He had so little money that was using the remaining funds in the team&#x27;s league-controlled checking account to send the team to training camp. In short order, league officials pushed Roulier out and took control of the team.

The league could not fold the team because of a clause in its television contract with ABC Sports requiring the league to have teams in the nation&#x27;s three largest markets. While ABC had not concerned itself with the demise of the Chicago Blitz after the 1984 season, the league&#x27;s owners feared that ABC would pull its contract if the Express were shut down—an action that would have probably killed the league. Unfortunately, potential buyers were scared off by the prospect of having to assume the burden of the Express&#x27; massive payroll.

Under the circumstances, the other owners had no option but to operate the Express as a ward of the league for the 1985 season. McSherry became nominal team president. The owners were required to contribute $500,000 apiece to fund the Express–enough to meet payroll, but little else. Notably, no money was allocated for replacing injured players.

===1985 season===

The league found itself operating a team for the second year in a row; it had been forced to take over the Blitz after new owner James Hoffman walked away from the team during training camp. However, as bad as the situation with the Blitz had been for the league in 1984, the Express were even worse in 1985. Not only did the Express&#x27; roster costs dwarf Chicago&#x27;s due to the large contracts, but the league had contracted in the off-season and there were only 13 other teams to contribute to supporting the Express.

In what proved to be a harbinger of things to come, the team was evicted from its hotel during training camp after the bill went unpaid. The players were forced to room with each other for the remainder of camp. They also went without water for much of camp after a $136 bill went unpaid. A bank won an attachment on the franchise as part of a lawsuit against Oldenburg after he defaulted on a loan. However, the attachment was withdrawn when bank officials learned they would be responsible for $1.3 million in player salaries that week.

After three close losses to start the season, including the season-opening game against the Houston Gamblers nicknamed &quot;The Greatest Game No One Saw&quot; after the Express surrendered a 20-point lead to the Gamblers to lose 34–33, they went 3–5 in their next eight games. Just when it looked like the season could be salvaged, the injury bug bit the team hard, decimating the roster. Young was among the more prominent casualties. At that point, the season turned into a complete fiasco, and the Express would not win another game. The nine-game losing streak was the second-longest in league history, behind only the Wranglers&#x27; 10-game losing streak in 1983. One of those games was a 51–0 thrashing by the Denver Gold—the largest margin of defeat in league history.

The Express&#x27; on-field collapse was all the more stunning since this was essentially the same team that had gone all the way to the Western Conference title game a year earlier. However, the rash of injuries made a shambles of the depth chart. At one point late in the season, the team was so short of healthy offensive linemen that one player had to back up the entire starting line. Even without this to consider, the young Express players suspected that the team wouldn&#x27;t be around for the planned move to the fall in 1986, even if the league managed to survive the 1985 season. With this in mind, they played tentatively, fearing injuries that might diminish their future NFL prospects.

With no money to replace injured players, Klosterman and Hadl had to resort to creative measures to field a team. In one game, they signed a 39-year-old truck driver to start at tackle. For the season finale against Orlando, Young had to line up at running back for most of the second half because the Express didn&#x27;t have any healthy running backs.

If possible, the off-field situation was even worse. No money was allocated to pay office bills or buy tape for players&#x27; ankles. They went for much of the offseason without postage, and had to talk a local company into processing season ticket renewals through their postage meter. The lights and phones were sometimes turned off. They were forced to fire the cheerleaders in a cost-cutting move. Late in the season, there wasn&#x27;t even a public address announcer.

Even as the team&#x27;s infrastructure fell apart, the players still got paid, thus avoiding a repeat of situations in Portland, Arizona, Houston and San Antonio. In a bizarre scene, the players rolled into team headquarters in Manhattan Beach in luxury cars and toting Gucci bags, but the grass on the practice fields went uncut for much of the season because the landscapers hadn&#x27;t been paid.

Attendance continued to plummet; the club drew just 67,533 fans for their eight dates at the Coliseum &quot;combined&quot; – well short of the stadium&#x27;s capacity for even a single game – or 8,442 per contest. League commissioner Harry Usher was under fire to find an owner and fix the Express&#x27; problem. Desperate for a solution, Usher had the team try a smaller stadium for its final home game: John Shephard Stadium on the campus of Los Angeles Pierce College, a junior college in the San Fernando Valley. The stadium, which had already hosted an Express preseason game in February, increased its capacity to 16,000 for the contest. Usher and the league owners hoped if the game did well they might have some ammunition to land a potential owner.

That game almost didn&#x27;t occur when the team&#x27;s bus driver refused to take them to Pierce College without being paid up front, in cash. Young passed a hat around, but no one was willing to chip in. Finally, the trainer offered to cash his check, and the driver took them to the game. However, the contest was still not a sellout; only 8,200 people (barely half of the stadium&#x27;s capacity, and actually less than their average in the Coliseum) saw Young and the Express lose 21–10 to Doug Williams and the Outlaws. The playing conditions left much to be desired; the field was strewn with rocks and potholes, and some areas were merely painted dirt. The scoreboard was positioned at an angle that made it useless once the sun began setting. While the game drew double what the Express had drawn for their previous two home games at the Coliseum, the experiment was so embarrassing that Usher nearly lost his job.

A week later, they lost to the Renegades, 17–10; as mentioned above, Young had to play part of the game at running back. They were almost stranded in Orlando when the pilot of their charter plane insisted on being paid in advance before allowing the players to board. The team&#x27;s final record was 3–15, last in the league.

===Demise of the franchise and the league===

Unable to find a new owner for the Express, the USFL announced the team would suspend operations for the 1986 season. However, many of the very issues that plagued the Express in 1985 made it very likely the team would not have returned even if the league had succeeded in winning a large payoff from the NFL to finance a move to a fall schedule in 1986. Additionally, the Express would have had to compete against two NFL teams and, if they had returned to the Coliseum, would have had to share their home with one of them (the Raiders) and the University of Southern California&#x27;s team. In the end, the USFL cancelled its 1986 season, never to return.

==Aftermath==

After trying all season in 1985, Steve Young and Gary Zimmerman were finally able to buy their way out of the USFL. Both went on to Hall of Fame careers in the NFL.

The &quot;Los Angeles Express&quot; name was briefly revived in 2013 for a proposed A-11 Football League team, but those plans fell through in April 2014 due to California&#x27;s workers compensation situation.

*One last marketing move by the Express just before the league folded was a solicitation to students at USC (located adjacent to the Coliseum) of season passes for $100.
*The chief operating officer of the Express was former NFL star Fred &quot;Curly&quot; Morrison.
*The &quot;LAX&quot; pun from the team&#x27;s pseudo-initials – &quot;LAX&quot; is the well-known International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport code for Los Angeles International Airport – would later be used by the Los Angeles Xtreme of the XFL.
*While playing for the Express, Steve Young became the first quarterback in professional football history to pass for 300 or more yards and rush for 100 or more yards in a single game. 
*Lisa Moretti was a cheerleader for the team before becoming a professional wrestler.

<text>An epithalamium (; Latin form of Greek ἐπιθαλάμιον &quot;epithalamion&quot; from ἐπί &quot;epi&quot; &quot;upon,&quot; and θάλαμος &quot;thalamos&quot; &quot;nuptial chamber&quot;) is a poem written specifically for the bride on the way to her marital chamber. This form continued in popularity through the history of the classical world; the Roman poet Catullus wrote a famous epithalamium, which was translated from or at least inspired by a now-lost work of Sappho. According to Origen, the Song of Songs might be an epithalamium on the marriage of Solomon with the Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter.

==History==
It was originally among the Greeks a song in praise of bride and bridegroom, sung by a number of boys and girls at the door of the nuptial chamber. According to the scholiast on Theocritus, one form was employed at night, and another, to rouse the bride and bridegroom on the following morning. In either case, as was natural, the main burden of the song consisted of invocations of blessing and predictions of happiness, interrupted from time to time by the ancient chorus of &quot;Hymen o Hymenaee&quot;. Among the Romans a similar custom was in vogue, but the song was sung by girls only, after the marriage guests had gone, and it contained much more of what modern attitudes would identify as obscene.

==Development as a literary form==

In the hands of the poets the epithalamium was developed into a special literary form, and received considerable cultivation. Sappho, Anacreon, Stesichorus and Pindar are all regarded as masters of the species, but the finest example preserved in Greek literature is the 18th &quot;Idyll&quot; of Theocritus, which celebrates the marriage of Menelaus and Helen. In Latin, the epithalamium, imitated from Fescennine Greek models, was a base form of literature, when Catullus redeemed it and gave it dignity by modelling his &quot;Marriage of Thetis and Peleus&quot; on a lost ode of Sappho.

In later times Statius, Ausonius, Sidonius Apollinaris and Claudian are the authors of the best-known epithalamia in classical Latin; and they have been imitated by Julius Caesar Scaliger, Jacopo Sannazaro, and a whole host of modern Latin poets, with whom, indeed, the form was at one time in great favor.

In the Italian Renaissance, the (meaning &#x27;for a wedding&#x27;; sometimes simply ; also &quot;nuptialia&quot;) emerged as a form of epithalamium, taking the form of a pamphlet, privately printed in small numbers on the occasion of a wedding. The tradition had declined by the 20th century. Collections of can be found in the London Library, the Biblioteca Teresiana, the Capretta collection at the National Central Library in Florence, the Casella collection at the State Library of Berlin, and the Mazzoni collection at Duke University.

The names of Ronsard, Malherbe and Scarron are especially associated with the genre in French literature, and Marino and Metastasio in Italian. Perhaps no poem of this class has been more universally admired than the pastoral &quot;Epithalamion&quot; of Edmund Spenser (1595), though he also has important rivals—Ben Jonson, Donne and Francis Quarles. Ben Jonson&#x27;s friend, Sir John Suckling, is known for his epithalamium &quot;A Ballad Upon a Wedding.&quot; In his ballad, Suckling playfully demystifies the usual celebration of marriage by detailing comic rustic parallels and identifying sex as the great leveler.

At the close of &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;, Tennyson has appended a poem, on the nuptials of his sister, which is strictly an epithalamium.

E. E. Cummings also returns to the form in his poem &quot;Epithalamion&quot;, which appears in his 1923 book &quot;Tulips and Chimneys&quot;. E.E.Cummings&#x27; Epithalamion consists of three seven octave parts, and includes numerous references to ancient Greece.

The term is occasionally used beyond poetry, for example to describe Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

== Music ==
Johann Wanning of Danzig is the composer of the first known musical &quot;epithalamium&quot;, a two-movement work for six voices, probably composed in the 1580s.

In Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, the &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; (Treulich Geführt) of Act 3 is also called &quot;Epithalamium&quot; in several program notes: concert in London, 26 March 1855; concert in Paris, 25 January 1860; concert in Brussels, 24 March 1860.

The &quot;Epithalamium of Vindex&quot; is a popular aria from &quot;Néron&quot;, by Anton Rubinstein (composed in 1875–76, premiered in 1879).

The English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872–1958) composed a choral work called &quot;Epithalamion&quot; consisting of 11 movements: The Prologue, Wake Now, The Calling of the Bride, The Minstrels, Procession of the Bride, The Temple Gates, The Bell Ringers, The Lover&#x27;s Song, The Minstrel&#x27;s Song, Song of the Winged Loves, and Prayer to Juno. Set for baritone, chorus, flute, piano, and strings, the work is based on Spenser&#x27;s poem of the same name. As he often did, Vaughan Williams incorporated the flavour of English folk songs into these songs.

The 20th-century French organist-composer (and successor in his post to Charles Tournemire and César Franck) Jean Langlais (1907–1991) includes it as a title in his collection &quot;Ten Pieces&quot; for organ (No. 9). A late orchestral work by the Catalan composer Roberto Gerhard (1896–1970) is entitled &quot;Epithalamion&quot;.

French composer Jean-Yves Daniel-Lesur composed a suite of choral motets titled &quot;Le Cantique des Cantiques&quot;, of which the last is &quot;Épithalame&quot;. This has achieved lasting popularity following its televised première by Marcel Couraud’s Ensemble Vocal. It has been recorded by The Sixteen and others. A 1953 commission by André Jolivet is similarly titled.

Norwegian composer Fartein Valen composed an orchestral piece called &quot;Epithalamion&quot; Op. 19 in 1933, celebrating the wedding of his nephew.

American John Harbison composed the four movement work &quot;Olympic Dances&quot;, of which the second movement is entitled &quot;Epithalamion&quot;, in 1996 under commission from the College Band Directors National Association. Eugene Migliaro Corporon and the North Texas Wind Symphony recorded the work on the &quot;Wind Dances&quot; album released in 2000 on the Klavier label (K-11084).

In 2006, British composer John McCabe was commissioned by John Sell to write a piano piece for the 70th birthday of his wife Jane Wade. &quot;Epithalamium&quot; was given its world premiere in 2007 by Malcolm Binns at the Wigmore Hall in London.

==Painting==
Epithalamia were also a painting genre popular in Italy during the Renaissance. These were nudes presented as wedding gifts, which were intended to wish newlyweds happiness and fertility. Venus and Cupid was a common subject. Lorenzo Lotto&#x27;s epithalamic painting notably portrayed Cupid as a puer mingens urinating on Venus, a gesture that symbolized fertility in Renaissance artwork.

Although epithalamia existed only in poetic form during antiquity, during the Renaissance it was believed that presenting gifts of erotic paintings was an ancient Roman tradition.

<text>The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA; , &quot;ASFC&quot;) is a federal law enforcement agency that is responsible for border control (i.e. protection and surveillance), immigration enforcement, and customs services in Canada.

The CBSA is responsible to Parliament through Dominic Leblanc who is the Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs of Canada, which is under the direction of Erin O’Gorman who is also the president of Canada Border Services Agency.

The Agency was created on 12 December 2003, by an order-in-council that amalgamated the customs function of the now-defunct Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, the enforcement function of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (now known as Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada), and the port-of-entry examination function of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The CBSA&#x27;s creation was formalized by the &quot;Canada Border Services Agency Act&quot;, which received Royal Assent on 3 November 2005.

The CBSA oversees approximately 1,200 service locations across Canada and 35 in other countries. It employs over 16,500 public servants and offers 24-hour service at 117 of its land border crossings and 10 of the 13 international airports it serves. It works closely with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to enforce immigration laws by facilitating the removal of inadmissible individuals from the country and assisting local police in the investigation of violations of the &quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Act&quot;.

CBSA&#x27;s Inland Enforcement branch tracks down and removes foreign nationals who are in Canada illegally.

The Agency oversees operations at three major sea ports and three CBSA mail centres (CMC), and operates detention facilities, known as immigration holding centres (IHC), in Laval, Quebec; Toronto, Ontario; and Surrey, British Columbia.

== History ==
Before 2004, border security in Canada was handled by three legacy agencies that performed individual functions:
*Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA, now defunct), customs;
*Citizenship and Immigration Canada (now IRCC), enforcement;
*Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), food inspection at ports of entry.

The auditor general identified the issues in having the responsibility of border security be divided, such as the inability of individual agencies to share certain security information, as well as ineffective inter-agency communication. Thus, in 2003, the border enforcement functions taken on by the separate agencies would consolidate into a singular organization, titled the Canada Border Services Agency, with Alain Jolicoeur appointed as its inaugural president. Originally, under CCRA, Canada Customs was joined with the country&#x27;s revenue service, though the agency would primarily give its focus to tax collection. With the establishment of Border Services, CCRA&#x27;s taxation responsibilities would break off into the Canada Revenue Agency, while its customs function would be absorbed entirely by the CBSA.

The agency has since undergone significant changes to its overall structure, as well as to its range of duties and institutional priorities.

=== Arming officers ===
During its initial years, CBSA officers, just as their CCRA predecessors, were not equipped with firearms. This would be the case until 2006, when the Government of Canada would approve of the &quot;CBSA Arming Initiative&quot;, a 10-year strategy to arm and train Border Services Officers (BSOs).

One of the first significant policy changes to come to the agency was allowing CBSA officers to arrest and detain individuals at the border for non-customs related violations of Canadian law. These responsibilities would eventually lead to the implementation of use of force policies, after which BSOs across Canada began to carry collapsible batons, pepper spray, and handcuffs, though it would take several years before they could be equipped with firearms. The 2006 Canadian federal budget introduced to equip BSOs with side arms and to eliminate single-person border crossings.

The sidearm of choice is the Beretta Px4 Storm.

==== Implementation ====
In August 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that arming BSOs would begin in early 2007 and would continue through 2016, marking the 10-year strategy. The arming of officers at Ports of Entry (POEs) across Canada was conducted systematically, with ports that were considered the busiest and/or most dangerous to be completed first. Some of the first officers to be armed were those working at Ontario&#x27;s Windsor-Detroit POE, the busiest highway port of entry in Canada.

As of 2019, Border Services Officers at all POEs are issued duty firearms. However, BSOs working within major airport terminals are not authorized to be armed and must instead store and lock their firearms.

=== 2021 strike ===
In August 2021, around 8,500 employees of the Agency represented by the Public Service Alliance of Canada and the Customs and Immigration Union went on a work-to-rule strike, just days before COVID-19 restrictions on crossing the Canada–United States border were due to be eased. Having been without a collective bargaining agreement since 2018, the demands of the strike were an increase in salaries to reach equality with other law enforcement officials in Canada, increased protections against harassment and discrimination, as well as the implementation of a policy to allow non-uniformed officials to work from home. An agreement was reached between the workers and the Canadian government in the evening of the same day, ending the strike after one day.

== Policy and legislation ==

=== Independent Complaint Review Commission ===
A report ordered by the federal government in 2017 urged for the creation of a new independent oversight committee to monitor, address, and investigate complaints against the CBSA. Currently, CBSA has no independent civilian oversight. It is considered an unusual situation by many provincial law associations as nearly every policing agency in Canada has some form of independent oversight body. The Liberal government announced in 2019 a budget allocating $24 million over five years, to expand the mandate of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission. The commission will provide service to both RCMP and CBSA. The proposed legislation (Bill C-98) was pending enactment, but did not clear the senate before the end of the parliamentary session in June 2019.

=== Electronic privacy rights at the border ===

==== Search protocols ====
CBSA policy and protocols for searching electronic devices have changed significantly in recent years. New and updated examination protocols now include:

* Searching the device only in airplane mode.
* Not accessing apps or software that connects to &quot;the cloud&quot;.
* Officers must take detailed notes before, after, and during the search.
* Officers should receive adequate training and accurately follow published CBSA policies.
* Officers must be able to articulate why the device is being searched in their notes.
* If you feel that you are in legal jeopardy, you are allowed to request consultation with legal representation.
* Files or folders labelled as &#x27;solicitor-client privilege&#x27; will not be immediately searched. The device may be set aside for a court to inspect.

==== Reformation ====
On 7 January 2020, Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien announced that the Agency had violated the law by carrying out unduly invasive searches of personal digital devices. Therrien filed a recommendation to parliament to have the border agency&#x27;s guidelines for examination of digital devices written into the &quot;Customs Act&quot; and says the threshold to trigger a search should be defined in law as &quot;reasonable grounds to suspect&quot; a crime or customs infraction. In response to Therrien&#x27;s comments, CBSA released a press statement announcing statistics on device searches. Legal analysts have speculated that the numbers released may be inaccurate.

== Operations ==
=== Border Services Officers ===
A Border Services Officer (BSO) is a federal law enforcement officer employed by the Canada Border Services Agency. While &quot;Border Services Officer&quot; is the overarching term for the CBSA&#x27;s front-line personnel, it is not a title derived from legislation. Rather, BSOs receive multiple legislative designations such as &quot;Customs Officer&quot; under the &quot;Customs Act&quot;; &quot;Immigration Officer&quot; under the &quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Act&quot;; and &quot;Screening Officer&quot; under the &quot;Quarantine Act&quot;. When enforcing customs- or immigration-related legislation, BSOs are Peace Officers under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. However, they can only make arrests for offences under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; if they are appointed as &quot;designated officers&quot; by the minister of public safety under the &quot;Customs Act&quot; (section 163.4) and are at customs offices performing the normal duties of an officer or by Section 99.1 of the &quot;Customs Act&quot;.

Currently, BSOs are equipped with handcuffs, pepper spray, batons, and Beretta PX4 Storm pistols. The arming initiative began in 2007 and officially concluded in 2016. BSOs are trained at the CBSA College, located in Rigaud, Quebec. The training begins with a 4-week online program called the &quot;Pre-OITP,&quot; followed by an 18-week program called the CBSA Officer Induction Training Program (OITP) which covers a range of topics from law (such as criminal law, immigration, and customs legislation) to control and defensive tactics.
=== Immigration ===

The CBSA plays a key role in immigration to Canada, as it has assumed the port-of-entry and enforcement mandates formerly held by Citizenship and Immigration Canada. CBSA officers work on the front lines, screening persons entering the country and removing those who are unlawfully in Canada.

As of the end of 2003, there were up to 200,000 illegal immigrants in Canada (most residing in Ontario). Most are refugee claimants whose refugee applications were rejected by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. There are very few illegal immigrants who enter the country without first being examined by the CBSA. The reason for this is that Canada is physically very difficult to get to, except crossing the Canada-US Border. As the US is itself a prime destination for illegal immigrants, not many illegal immigrants then attempt to cross the border into Canada in the wild.

There has been a recent increase in the number of illegal entrants from St. Pierre &amp; Miquelon who travel in makeshift boats. High unemployment in the French colony has spurred this increase, which has been acknowledged by the Government of France. The CBSA and Royal Canadian Navy are considering increased marine patrols to intercept the illegal migrants. While residents could lawfully travel to France, the expensive airfare has made the relatively short boat ride to the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador more attractive for destitute economic migrants.

=== Examinations, searches, and seizures ===
All persons and goods entering Canada are subject to examination by CBSA officers. An examination can be as simple as a few questions, but can also include an examination of the subject&#x27;s vehicle and/or luggage, electronic devices, more intensive questioning, or strip-searches. The intensity of an examination depends on the reasonable suspicion that the officer has to escalate the intensiveness of a search. CBSA Officers must adhere to strict search protocols, guidelines, and procedures during the examination process.

Examinations are performed to ensure compliance with customs and immigration legislation. CBSA officers are given their authority by the &quot;Customs Act&quot; and the &quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Act&quot; (IRPA). In addition, BSOs are also able to enforce other Acts of Parliament as they are designated as Peace Officers under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;.

The agency will also seize items it labels obscene, as it did in February 2009 when it detained and banned two films by the adult film director Michael Lucas. CBSA&#x27;s &quot;Policy On The Classification Of Obscene Material&quot; states that the &quot;ingestion of someone else&#x27;s urine... with a sexual purpose&quot; makes a film obscene.

In 2000, after a ten-year-long controversy over items the agency labelled obscene, the case reached the British Columbia Supreme Court. One judge in the case concluded not only that Border officials had wrongly delayed, confiscated, destroyed, damaged, prohibited, or misclassified materials imported by the appellant on numerous occasions, but that these errors were caused &quot;by the systemic targeting of Little Sisters&#x27; importations in the Vancouver Customs.

=== Enforcement &amp; Intelligence ===
==== Criminal Investigations and prosecutions ====
The Criminal Investigations unit of CBSA is tasked with investigating and pursuing prosecution of those who commit criminal offences against Canada&#x27;s border legislation. CBSA investigators are responsible for operational activities including:

* Investigation of fraudulent activities related to the importation/exportation of goods and the movement of people;
* Reviewing leads, researching, and gathering evidence;
* Conducting forensic examinations on digital devices and media;
* Execution of search warrants;
* Preparation and serving of documents (e.g. corrective, civil, criminal);
* Assisting foreign customs administrations with their investigation of customs offences (CMAA, MLAT); and
*Criminal prosecutions (preparing Crown Briefs, recommending specific charges, assisting the Public Prosecution Service of Canada).

==== Intelligence ====

The CBSA maintains a robust and comprehensive Intelligence program, which is mandated to provide timely, accurate, and relevant intelligence support to operational decision-makers at all levels within the Agency. Information is lawfully collected from a variety of sources, including open and closed source materials, domestic and international intelligence partners, joint operations with other law enforcement agencies, sophisticated technical means, covert surveillance, and informants/human intelligence. Intelligence officers and analysts are deployed within Canada—along the borders and throughout the country—as well as overseas.

The agency turns the information it collects into intelligence by using automated risk analysis, analytical tools, and risk management. This allows it to work toward its objective of balancing security concerns with the need to facilitate the flow of people and goods. The agency seeks to manage risks through several means; including the collection and analysis of intelligence information; the use of detection tools; the analysis of indicators and judgment of front-line officers; and random checks.

Threat and risk assessments are widely recognized as valuable decision-making tools when setting examination priorities. The agency&#x27;s intelligence directorate conducts a border risk assessment of its border operations every 2–3 years. Under this process, the agency assesses the risks of smuggling contraband, such as drugs, firearms, proceeds of crime, child pornography, illicit tobacco, etc. The information is assessed and ranked by commodity and by mode of transport. The agency will include the risks of irregular or illegal migration of people, and the movement of food, plants, and animals, now under the agency&#x27;s broader mandate, in the next version of its border risk assessment.

The agency also prepares a national port risk assessment every two years. The agency assessed the relative risk to 168 ports of entry in 2006 and 220 in 2004. Regional intelligence analysts, in consultation with other sources and port operational staff, complete a questionnaire detailing port demographics, traffic volume, enforcement, and intelligence information. The 2006 risk assessment ranked 23 ports as high-risk and included information on suspected criminal and national security risks, as well as the risk of irregular or illegal migration of people.

In addition to the border and port risk assessment processes, the intelligence directorate provides daily, weekly, and monthly updates on specific threats and trends in unlawful activities. Intelligence officers and analysts frequently participate in tactical and operational law enforcement activities such as search warrants, arrests, surveillance, the recruitment and retention of confidential informers, interviews of detainees, and the analysis of seized goods and evidence.

==== Border Watch ====
The CBSA Border Watch toll-free info line offers citizens the opportunity to report suspicious cross-border activity directly to the agency directly and confidentially. The Border Watch line differs from other phone lines for the public, such as CrimeStoppers or the RCMP info line in that it is designed to focus directly on border-related intelligence.

=== Detector Dog Service (DDS) ===
Detector dogs begin training between the ages of 11 and 16 months and work for an average of 8 to 10 years. Several different breeds are used, but the CBSA primarily uses Labrador Retriever for firearm, drug, and currency detection, while using the Beagle for plant, food, and animal detection. Dogs live with their handler full-time. While the dog is at work, it is transported in air-conditioned vehicles that act as a mobile kennel.

The AMPS program, implemented in December 2005, is a system that encourages compliance with customs legislation through the tendering of monetary penalties. It is used mainly as an enforcement tool on technical infractions, where the subject did not necessarily intend to breach the legislation, but failed to comply in some way. For more serious or deliberate infractions, the goods in question may be seized or subject to forfeiture. AMPS penalties are imposed depending on the severity and frequency of the infraction. Multiple infractions will result in higher penalties under the AMPS system.

The CBSA&#x27;s use of detector dogs began with three canine units at the Windsor port of entry in 1978. The program has since expanded to include 69 detector dog teams located at ports across Canada. Detector dogs work in mail, air, land, and marine facilities. Each dog is trained to detect specific commodities, and is generally trained to fit into one of four profiles:

*Narcotics, explosives, and firearms;
*Currency;
*Tobacco; or
*Food, plant, and animal (FPA)

==== Role ====
Detector dogs provide BSOs with one of the most effective tools in the detection of contraband. Although other tools are available to BSOs, detector dogs are highly efficient in their ability to accurately locate the source of a scent and thus can save time in labour-intensive examinations of vehicles, luggage, and cargo. This speeds up the process for BSOs as well as for the travelling public.

The CBSA uses passive detector dogs, unlike some other law enforcement agencies, which use active dogs. When a passive dog detects a scent that it has been trained to recognize, it sits beside the source of the smell. While active dogs, which bark, scratch, dig, or bite at the source of the scent, were used initially by the CBSA, passive dogs allow the officer to circulate among passengers more peacefully and are considered by the Agency to be more effective in the course of their work. The Passive Dog training was implemented in 1993 and is now the Agency&#x27;s preference.

==== Training ====
Detector Dog teams (consisting of a dog and a single handler) undergo a 10-week training course at the CBSA Learning Centre. The handlers are Border Services Officers and are trained on how to care for, maintain, and train their dogs. They are also trained to understand the &quot;Cone of Scent;&quot; odour particles always disperse in the shape of a cone: more concentrated at the source, and less concentrated farther away. After the initial training, the handler must keep up a training regimen to ensure their dog remains in top form. Only about 1 in 10 dogs who begin the training eventually become detector dogs.

While there is no specific description for a detector dog, the CBSA looks for certain characteristics that make a better potential detector dog, including:

* Ability and desire to retrieve
* Good physical condition
* Alertness
* Sociability
* Boldness
* Temperament

=== Canada–US cooperation ===
One of the central purposes for the CBSA&#x27;s creation was to address heightened security concerns 9/11 and to respond to criticisms that Canada was not doing enough to ensure the security of North America, especially from the United States, which had begun substantial changes years before the 2001 attacks. In the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States, Canada&#x27;s border operations had to place enhanced emphasis on national security and public safety. As a result, the United States established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) led by Secretary Tom Ridge, who would partner with Canada&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister at the time, John Manley, to create the Smart Border Declaration in December 2001. The declaration would provide objectives for cooperation between Canadian-American border operations.

=== Smart Border Declaration and Action Plan ===

The Smart Border Declaration and Action Plan, also known as &quot;the&quot; &quot;Smart Border Accord&quot;, was signed in 2001 and is an initiative of the Government of Canada—specifically the CBSA, RCMP, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade— and the United States Government—particularly the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), CBP, and the U.S. Coast Guard. The two major signatories to the Declaration were Canadian Deputy Prime Minister John Manley and then-US Director of Homeland Security Tom Ridge.

The accord was set up to facilitate the cross-border flow of travelers and goods, consisting of 30 points of common interest to improve both security and trade between the two countries. Included in the plan are initiatives to improve the biometric features of Permanent Resident Cards in both Canada and the US, sharing Advanced Passenger Information and creating compatible immigration databases.

There are four main pillars to the &quot;Action Plan&quot;:

# Secure flow of people;
# Secure flow of goods;
# Investing in secure infrastructure; and
# Coordination and information sharing in the enforcement of these objectives

=== Canada–United States Integrated Border Enforcement Teams ===
Integrated Border Enforcement Teams (IBET) were created as a part of the Accord to consolidate the law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering expertise of different agencies in both countries. The IBET consists of members from the CBSA, RCMP, CBP, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. ICE Teams. However, IBETs also enlist the help of other municipal, provincial, and federal agencies on certain projects.

In Canada, IBETs operate in 15 regions across the Canada-U.S. border in air, sea, and land modes. They are based on a model started along the B.C.-Washington state border in 1996. Since their inception, IBETs have helped disrupt smuggling rings involved in the Smuggling of Alcohol, drug trade, Tobacco, grand theft auto, and human trafficking. The Dodge Charger is currently used by the CBSA&#x27;s Inland Enforcement Program, while the Ford Explorer, the Ford Police Interceptor Sedan, the Dodge Caravan, and the Ford F-250 are used at the port of entry. Other vehicles include the Chevrolet Impala, the Chevrolet Tahoe, the Ford F-350, the Ford E-250, the Dodge RAM, the Chevrolet Silverado, and a Navistar International HV used as the agency&#x27;s X-RAY truck.

== Organization ==

=== CBSA regions and branches ===
The CBSA has seven regions across Canada, including the Atlantic Region, the Greater Toronto Area Region, the Northern Ontario Region, the Pacific Region, the Prairie Region, the Quebec Region, and the Southern Ontario Region. The Agency consists of nine branches and one group reporting directly to the President.

* CBSA Assessment and Revenue Management
* Chief Transformation Officer
* Commercial &amp; Trade
* Corporate &amp; Finance Management
* Human Resources
* Information, Science and Technology
* Intelligence and Enforcement
* Internal Audit and Program Evaluation (Direct report)
* Strategic Policy
* Travellers

=== CBSA organizational structure ===
Erin O’Gorman was appointed President of the CBSA in July 2022. She served formerly as the Associate Secretary at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat from 2018 to 2022 and the Assistant Secretary, Government Position Sector at TBS from 2017 to 2018. 
She also served as Assistant Deputy Minister at Natural Resources Canada from 2015 to 2017 and Director General of aviation Security at Transport Canada from 2011 to 2015, plus positions with the Privy Council Office as Director of Operations from 2007 to 2010 and as Chief of Staff to the National Security Advisor from 2006 to 2007.

== Insignia ==
In addition to using generic identifiers imposed by the Federal Identity Program (FIP), the CBSA is one of several federal departments (primarily those involved with law enforcement, security, or having a regulatory function) that has been granted heraldic symbols by the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

The coat of arms was granted on June 15, 2010, and presented by Queen Elizabeth II on July 6, 2010. The ceremony was the Queen&#x27;s last function in her 2010 Canadian Royal Tour. Also in attendance were Governor General Michaëlle Jean and Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Use of the coat of arms is reserved for special occasions, and it is normally associated with the office of the CBSA president.

The heraldic badge was approved for use at the same time as the coat of arms. It portrays a gold tressure, which symbolizes the agency&#x27;s security focus. The portcullis represents His Majesty&#x27;s agents responsible for border services. The Latin motto translates into English as &quot;Protection, Service, Integrity&quot;. The badge figures prominently in the television series &quot;Border Security: Canada&#x27;s Front Line&quot;.

A flag was granted by the Canadian Heraldic Authority on December 20, 2012. It is meant to resemble the Canadian Blue Ensign, which was flown on government vessels (including those patrolling Canada&#x27;s maritime borders) before 1965.

== Commerce and trade ==
=== &quot;Customs Act&quot; ===
The &quot;Customs Act&quot; (1985) is one of the key pieces of legislation governing the CBSA mandate. It was first enacted in 1867 to:

* &quot;ensure the collection of duties;&quot;
* &quot;control the movement of people and goods into and out of Canada;&quot; and
* &quot;protect Canadian industry from real or potential injury caused by the actual or contemplated import of dumped or subsidized goods and by other forms of unfair competition.&quot;

Rather than being a taxing statute itself, the &quot;Customs Act&quot; provides &quot;legislative authority to administer and enforce the collection of duties and taxes that are imposed under separate taxing legislation, such as the &quot;Customs Tariff Act&quot;, the &quot;Excise Tax Act&quot;, the &quot;Excise Act&quot;, and the &quot;Special Import Measures Act&quot;.&quot; The Act was revised in 1986 to allow for greater flexibility in modern transportation, communication, trade, and business practices. Accordingly, since 1986, the Act has been amended several times in response to free trade and other related international agreements.

=== Customs Self Assessment ===
The Customs Self Assessment program gives approved importers a streamlined accounting and paying process for all imported goods. Importers are required to apply for acceptance into the program

=== Advance Commercial Information ===
Advance Commercial Information (ACI) is a major ongoing project of the CBSA that requires airborne as well as waterborne cargo entering Canada to be registered with the Agency. Assisting officials at seaports and airports in their inspections, the program allows for the tracking of suspicious materials. These phases of the project were implemented in 2005, with a similar highway and rail cargo program to follow shortly.

By comparison, ACI is similar to the United States–based Automated Manifest System. The project aims to improve border security and efficiency, and once completely implemented, ACI will require that all commercial cargo entering Canada be electronically registered with the CBSA.

==== History ====
In 2000, then-Minister of National Revenue Martin Cauchon introduced the objectives that would lead to ACI as part of the &quot;Customs Action Plan&quot;. After the September 11 attacks against the United States, the security benefits associated with the project took on a new importance. In the Canada-US Smart Border Declaration created in December of that year, then-Foreign Affairs Minister John Manley and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge called for &quot;a system to collaborate in identifying high-risk goods while expediting the flow of low-risk goods.&quot;

The idea for ACI was based on the American Container Security Initiative (CSI) that created preclearance rules. With the CSI effectively posting customs officers in foreign ports around the world, Canada was under significant pressure to introduce a similar plan or face the reality that CBP officers would be placed in Canadian ports. As this would be a very visible loss of Canadian sovereignty, the CBSA quickly came up with the ACI plan.

==== Enforcement &amp; Implementation ====
Phase 1 of ACI came into effect on 19 April 2004. Data on shipborne cargo must be transmitted to CBSA no later than 24 hours before the loading of the cargo. The data is available to Customs officials at each of Canada&#x27;s major ports, and any anomalies can be investigated by mobile teams with secure, wireless access to the database. Sensors have also been installed to detect unusual radiation levels in cargo.

Phase 2 saw these measures extended to air cargo, and ACI systems were installed in airports across Canada. This phase went into effect in July 2006. ACI Phase 2 also expanded marine requirements to include shipments loaded in the United States.

Phase 3 implemented eManifest, which requires the electronic transmission of advance cargo and conveyance information from carriers for all highway and rail shipments. In addition, the electronic transmission of advance secondary data became required from freight forwarders and the advance importer data became a requirement from importers or their brokers.

== Controversies &amp; Incidents ==

=== Searching of digital devices ===
Whilst the laws surrounding electronic privacy rights at the border are currently considered unsettled, several new court cases are raising the issue that personal electronic devices (such as cell phones and laptops) should be afforded a higher level of privacy.

In August 2018, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) published a guide surrounding searches of electronic devices at the border. The guide was distributed by major media outlets in Canada. The BCCLA guide cautions travelers that Canadian courts have not yet established if searches of electronic devices without suspicion are considered “an unreasonable invasion of privacy”. Travelers crossing the border are advised by the BCCLA to minimize the data that is stored on their devices to mitigate risk.

On November 12, 2019, a federal court in Boston, USA ruled that the government must have reasonable suspicion of digital contraband before searching electronic devices at U.S. border crossings. The judgment has ignited speculation that Canada should have updated legislation surrounding this area of law.

==== Philippon ====
In March 2015, Alain Philippon, from Ste-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, was referred to a secondary inspection after returning from a trip to the Dominican Republic. During the inspection, Philippon refused CBSA officers&#x27; request to disclose the password to his phone. Philippon was then charged with hindering an officer&#x27;s job under section 153.1(b) of the &quot;Customs Act&quot;, which carries a maximum sentence of twelve months imprisonment and a fine. Following his arrest, Philippon said that he would fight the charge as he considered his phone to be &quot;personal.&quot; His case would receive national and international attention, with several organizations arguing that the right to privacy granted by the Charter could extend to electronic devices at the border, especially in light of recent Supreme Court case law.

In August 2016, Philippon entered a guilty plea and was ordered to pay a fine. The plea meant that no Charter challenge was to be raised, thus leaving unanswered the question of whether or not refusing to provide a password to a customs officer is considered hindering.

==== Singh ====
In January 2018, Gurbir Singh, an Indian national studying in Canada, was arrested by CBSA officers and subsequently charged with possession of child pornography. Singh was initially questioned to determine his admissibility into Canada under the &quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Act&quot;. After a search of Singh&#x27;s cell phone revealed a photo suspected to be child pornography, Officer Buechert focused his search exclusively on child pornography. Officer Buechert originally sought to continue his search based on gathering evidence for smuggling charges under the &quot;Customs Act&quot;, rather than a &quot;Criminal Code&quot; offense. Upon discovery of illicit images, Officer Buechert contacted the Ontario Provincial Police, who later pressed criminal charges upon Singh. Singh was subject to no charges under the Customs Act. Singh contested the inclusion of evidence from the CBSA search on his cell phone, arguing that the broad expansive search powers under the &quot;Customs Act&quot; would render the administration of justice in disrepute if it was applied to prosecute offenses under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;.

On June 18, 2019, the Ontario Court of Justice decided to exclude the evidence against Singh. Justice Deluzio indicated that while broad search and interrogation powers are necessary for the security of Canadian borders, it was inappropriate to abuse such powers to solely further a criminal investigation that was outside the purview of protecting Canadian borders, considering Singh could not refuse the search or further questioning, nor was a search warrant obtained.

==== Canfield ====
In October 2020, the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled a federal &quot;Customs Act&quot; section dealing with inspection of goods violates the charter when it comes to searching digital devices. The court found the Canada Border Services Agency infringed on the rights of two men charged with pornography offenses after a search of their cell phones at the Edmonton international airport. It wrote their rights were violated under s 8 of the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which says everyone has &quot;the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure,&quot; and s 10, which specifies rights upon arrest or detention, including the right to consult a lawyer and the right to habeas corpus. The decision is significant because it is one of a handful of cases where a lower court has ever revisited a Supreme Court of Canada decision.

The court also suspended the declaration of invalidity of the relevant section of the &quot;Customs Act&quot; for one year to provide Parliament with the opportunity to amend the legislation to determine how to address searches of personal electronic devices at the border. Despite the violation of charter rights, the appeal court decided to allow the inclusion of evidence obtained by CBSA. On March 11, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the applicant&#x27;s leave to appeal. The court did not provide any additional commentary on the decision.

Crown counsel applied for a six-month extension to the suspension of Customs Act provision. The extension was granted by the Court of Appeal on October 22, 2021. As of May 2022, changes to the Customs Act provision have not been made or implemented. On April 20, 2022 Justices Jo’Anne Strekaf and Ritu Khullar denied the government’s request for a second six-month extension, writing that “public confidence is undermined when a law that has been declared to be unconstitutional continues to have effect in other than extraordinary circumstances.”

=== Peace Arch Border Crossing incidents ===
In 2010, CBSA Officer Daniel Greenhalgh from BC&#x27;s Peace Arch border crossing was convicted of sexually assaulting women in three separate incidents after ordering at least four unauthorized strip searches. On October 16, 2012, Andrew Crews, an American, shot CBSA Officer Lori Bowcock in the neck before killing himself. Bowcock survived. This was the first time since CBSA&#x27;s inception that an officer was shot while on duty.

=== Deaths in custody ===
Since 2000, at least 13 people have died while in the custody of the CBSA and its predecessor, with the two most recent deaths occurring in a week in two separate incidents in March 2016. Following the latest incidents in 2016, several organizations reacted and called for an immigration detention reform. The CBSA remains one of the few enforcement agencies in Canada without an independent and external oversight body.

=== TV show ===

Beginning in 2012, the CBSA participated in a TV documentary series produced by National Geographic called &quot;Border Security: Canada&#x27;s Front Line&quot;. The show was similar in format to the Australian version, in that it would follow CBSA officers from various ports, as well as Inland Enforcement teams. The show had attracted criticism from the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Bar Association due to its approach to privacy rights and its one-sided narrative.

In 2013, while filming for the show, the CBSA conducted a raid on a construction site in Vancouver, leading to the arrest of a Mexican national, Oscar Mata Duran. Duran was taken to Immigration detention centres, where he would be presented with a filming consent form. Canada&#x27;s Privacy Commissioner investigated after receiving a complaint from Duran. The Commissioner found that the CBSA breached Canada&#x27;s &quot;Privacy Act&quot; by filming their interaction with Duran before he was advised of the purposes of filming, and found that the coercive nature of being detained in a holding facility would have prevented Duran from providing informed consent for his appearance. The Commissioner lauded Duran as a real hero for lodging the privacy complaint even though he would not personally benefit from it. Duran was deported following the raid. In light of Duran&#x27;s complaint, the Privacy Commissioner recommended that the CBSA end its participation in the show, after which the CBSA announced that the show would not return for a fourth season. Most of the film locations included Toronto Pearson International Airport, Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, Peace Bridge (QEW), BC 15 and BC 99 Peace Arch.

<text>Tūrangi is a small town on the west bank of the Tongariro River, 50 kilometres south-west of Taupō on the North Island Volcanic Plateau of New Zealand. It was built to accommodate the workers associated with the Tongariro hydro-electric power development project and their families. The town was designed to remain as a small servicing centre for the exotic forest plantations south of Lake Taupō and for tourists. It is well known for its trout fishing and calls itself &quot;the trout fishing capital of the world&quot;. The major Māori &quot;hapū&quot; (tribe) of the Tūrangi area is Ngāti Tūrangitukua.
==Geography==

Tourism and forestry are the mainstay of the community with the Department of Corrections two prisons, Genesis Energy, the Department of Conservation and farming being the main employers. The town is also home to a Centre for Sustainable Practice at Awhi Farm, providing education and enterprise training.

==History==

===Māori settlement===
The area was settled by the people of Ngāti Tūwharetoa, descendants of those who had originally settled in the Kawerau area. The Ngāti Tūwharetoa invasion of Taupō occurred from about the 16th century with a war party under command of Tūrangitukua who engaged in a number of battles against earlier inhabitants of the Taupō, Rotoaira and Kaimanawa area. Following these battles a variety of settlements were established in the area with major pa established on the cliff overlooking the Tongariro River and at Waitahanui on the Tongariro Delta. Another important settlement was at Tokaanu.

The people who eventually become known as Ngāti Tūrangitukua associate mainly with Waitahanui pā. From here they established a number of homesteads along both sides of the Tongariro River and its tributaries, including houses along the main Highway to Taumarunui (now Hirangi Road). In 1910 construction of a wharepuni begun which eventually became the Hirangi Marae complex.
===Non-Māori settlement===
The first Europeans reached the Tūrangi area in the 1830s, however it was not until the 1850s that European settlement occurred with the construction of a Mission Station at Pukawa.

In the 1880s and 1890s brown and rainbow trout were introduced into the lake and rivers of the area. A small fishing camp was established at Taupahi on the Tongariro River bank (now Taupahi Road). European settlers used the camp for recreational fishing.

In the 1920s two prison farms were opened at Rangipo and Hautu because of the isolated nature of the area. Also during this period the Morar family arrived from India, settling and establishing a store in Tokaanu.

By 1960, the population was about 500.

===Tongariro power development===

In the 1950s, in response to post World War II needs for rapid expansion of energy resources to meet the growing industrialisation in New Zealand, the Tongariro Power Scheme proposal was developed. The scheme would require a large construction force, and provide accommodation for that force for the duration of the project.

Four sites were considered for the township to accommodate the project workers: Rotoaira, Rangipo, Tūrangi West, and Tūrangi East. The tourism potential of Lake Taupō was appreciated, as well as the economic benefits that could be captured by creating a permanent township. Taking into account accessibility, climate, and adequacy of suitable land for development of a township, it was decided proceed with the Turangi West site.

Construction of the modern town began late in 1964. The Government invested $16 million in the development and by May 1966, the population of Tūrangi had jumped from 500 to 2,500 people. By 1968 the population reached a high of 6,500. A model town with curving streets and cul-de-sacs, uniform houses, pedestrian shopping centre, car parks and separation from the traffic on the main highway was created.

Between 1967 and 1982 several hundred Italian hard-rock tunnellers came to Tūrangi to work on the Ministry of Works&#x27;s Tongariro Power Development project, building tunnels and an underground power station. The men were contracted by Italian company Codelfa-Cogefar, which supplied accommodation in six camps near the works, medical services, a priest and Italian food and wine for the workers. Many of these men were from around Treviso in northern Italy where the company was based. Italian traditions such as a mass for Santa Barbara, patron saint of tunnellers and miners, were also acknowledged. When the project was completed some of the workers returned to Italy but others stayed in New Zealand. In 2017 a 50-year reunion for Codelfa-Cogefar employees was held in Turangi.

A publicity pamphlet published by the Ministry of Works in 1969 described Tūrangi at that time as a pleasant and attractive town of 5000 people which offered a ‘balanced community life’. The pamphlet enumerated the town&#x27;s amenities, shops, and services, such as its mall, schools, sports facilities, library, maternity hospital, parks, and, not least, its wide, grassy verges and kerbing.

Following the completion of the project in the late 1970s, the Ministry of Works and other government departments began a process of selling assets within the Turangi township.
===Treaty settlement===

In 1989 Ngāti Tūrangitukua registered with the Waitangi Tribunal (Wai 84). The claim was heard under urgency between April and October 1994, and the Tribunal&#x27;s Report was released in September 1995.

The Tribunal found that the Crown had breached the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in a number of ways:
* The Crown acquired Māori land at Tūrangi West when Crown land at Tūrangi East was available:
* The Crown did not adequately consult with Ngāti Tūrangitukua regarding the construction of the township:
* The land taken for the township was in excess of the maximum area that the Crown promised it would take:
* The land the Crown undertook to lease for industrial purposes and return to the people after 10 to 12 years was compulsorily acquired and not returned:
* Wahi tapu were destroyed or damaged in the construction of the township:
* Adequate compensation was not paid for land acquired:
* The Crown did not give full effect to conservation values:
* The Crown did not pay Ngāti Tūrangitukua the respect due its mana as tangata whenua:
* The provisions of the Public Works Act 1928 and the Tūrangi Township Act 1964, relied on by the Crown in entering and taking the claimants&#x27; land, are inconsistent with the basic guarantee in Article II of the Treaty of Waitangi that Māori may keep their land until such time as they wish to sell it.
* The Tribunal found that, as a result of the Crown&#x27;s breaches of the principles of the Treaty, Ngāti Tūrangitukua lost much of its ancestral land. Its social and economic base was seriously eroded causing spiritual, cultural, and economic prejudice to Ngāti Tūrangitukua.

In July 1998, the Crown and Ngāti Tūrangitukua negotiated to achieve a full and final settlement of Ngāti Tūrangitukua&#x27;s Treaty claims and to remove the continuing sense of grievance.

The Crown and Ngāti Tūrangitukua entered into a deed of settlement on 26 September 1998, resulting in a full and final settlement of Ngāti Tūrangitukua&#x27;s Treaty claims relating to the development and construction of the Tūrangi Township and its after effects.

In 1999 the Ngāti Tūrangitukua Claims Settlement Act 1999 was passed to:

:(a) To record the apology given by the Crown to Ngāti Tūrangitukua in the deed of settlement executed on 26 September 1998 by the Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, the Right Honourable Sir Douglas Arthur Montrose Graham, for the Crown, and Ngāti Tūrangitukua; and
:(b) To give effect to certain provisions of that deed of settlement, being a deed that settles the Ngāti Tūrangitukua claims.

===Marae===

The local Hīrangi Marae and Tūwharetoa i te Aupōuri meeting house, located in the Tūrangi township, is a meeting place Ngāti Tūrangitukua and Ngāti Tūwharetoa.

Rongomai Marae and meeting house, located east of the township, is a meeting place of the Ngāti Tūwharetoa hapū of Ngāti Rongomai.

Korohē Marae Rereao meeting house, located further east, is a meeting place of the Ngāti Tūwharetoa hapū of Ngāti Hine. In October 2020, the Government committed $1,338,668 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae and 4 other Ngāti Tūwharetoa marae, creating 19 jobs.

==Government==
Tūrangi is located in the administrative areas of the Taupō District Council and three of the council&#x27;s eleven representatives are elected directly from a Tūrangi Tongariro ward. Tūrangi is administered by the Turangi/Tongariro Community Board under delegated powers from the Taupō District Council. This ensures that all locally important decisions are made by local residents.

The role of the Tūrangi Tongariro Community Boards is to:
* Represent and act as an advocate for, the interests of its communities.
* Consider and report on all matters referred to it by Council, or any matter of interest to the community board.
* Maintain an overview of services provided by Council within the community.
* Prepare an annual submission to Council on expenditure within the community.
* Communicate with community organisations and special interest groups within the community.

The Taupō District is itself part of the Waikato region, controlled administratively by the Environment Waikato.

Tūrangi is part of the Taupō electorate in New Zealand&#x27;s general elections. The electorate is currently represented in the New Zealand Parliament by Louise Upston (National).

==Education==

There are three schools in the Tūrangi area. Within the Tūrangi township are two schools, both area schools which cater for Year 1 to 13 students. The schools opened in February 2004, following the Tūrangi Education Network Review that resulted in the closure of four schools: Hirangi Primary, Turangi Primary, Tongariro High and Tauranga-Taupo Primary Schools were closed. Previously Pihanga Primary existed, but was closed in the mid 1980s.

A single Year 1–15 composite state area school, Tongariro School, was established in their place. with a roll of as of 

A Kura Kaupapa Māori for Year 1–13 students, Te Kura o Hirangi, was established for those who wish to receive their education in te reo Māori. with a roll of .

There is also a rural school at Kuratau, approximately 30 km west of Tūrangi on SH 41 to Taumarunui.

<text>The MIT Lincoln Laboratory, located in Lexington, Massachusetts, is a United States Department of Defense federally funded research and development center chartered to apply advanced technology to problems of national security. Research and development activities focus on long-term technology development as well as rapid system prototyping and demonstration. Its core competencies are in sensors, integrated sensing, signal processing for information extraction, decision-making support, and communications. These efforts are aligned within ten mission areas. The laboratory also maintains several field sites around the world.

The laboratory transfers much of its advanced technology to government agencies, industry, and academia, and has launched more than 100 start-ups.

==History==

===Origins===
At the urging of the United States Air Force, the Lincoln Laboratory was created in 1951 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as part of an effort to improve the U.S. air defense system. Primary advocates for the creation of the laboratory were veterans of the World War II-era MIT Radiation Laboratory, including physicist and electrical engineer Ivan A. Getting, physicist Louis Ridenour, and physicist George E. Valley Jr.

The laboratory&#x27;s inception was prompted by Valley&#x27;s investigations into the U.S. air defences, culminating in the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee&#x27;s 1950 report that concluded the United States was unprepared for the threat of an air attack. Because of MIT&#x27;s management of the Radiation Laboratory during World War II, the experience of some of its staff on the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee, and its proven competence in advanced electronics, the Air Force suggested that MIT could provide the research needed to develop an air defense that could detect, identify, and ultimately intercept air threats.

James R. Killian, the president of MIT, was not eager for MIT to become involved in air defense. He asked the United States Air Force if MIT could first conduct a study to evaluate the need for a new laboratory and to determine its scope. Killian&#x27;s proposal was approved, and a study named Project Charles (for the Charles River that flows past MIT) was carried out between February and August 1951. The final Project Charles report stated that the United States needed an improved air defense system and unequivocally supported the formation of a laboratory at MIT dedicated to air defense problems.

This new undertaking was initially called Project Lincoln, and the site chosen for the new laboratory was on the Laurence G. Hanscom Field (now Hanscom Air Force Base), where the Massachusetts towns of Bedford, Lexington and Lincoln meet. A Project Bedford (on antisubmarine warfare) and a Project Lexington (on nuclear propulsion of aircraft) were already in use, so Major General Putt, who was in charge of drafting the charter for the new laboratory, decided to name the project for the town of Lincoln.

===SAGE===
The Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Air Defense System is the beginning of MIT Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s history of developing innovative technology. The system was conceived to meet the challenge of providing air defense to the continental United States. SAGE was designed to collect, analyze, and finally relay data from a multitude of radars, all quickly enough that defense responses could be initiated, if needed. The key to this system was a computer that could perform reliably in real time.

MIT&#x27;s Whirlwind computer, built in the 1940s, looked to be a possible candidate for the system. However, the Whirlwind was not reliable or fast enough for the processing needed for analyzing data coming in from dozens of, perhaps even 100, radars. Jay Wright Forrester, an MIT professor instrumental in the development of the Whirlwind, found the breakthrough to enable the computer to achieve outstanding reliability and doubled speed — the magnetic-core memory. The magnetic-core memory revolutionized computing. Computers became machines that were not just large and fast calculators; their uses for varying applications grew. Industry followed this development closely, adopting the magnetic-core memory that expanded the capabilities of computers.

The TX-0 computer, in essence, a transistorized version of Whirlwind, was built in 1955 and made operational in 1956. It was smaller and slightly faster than Whirlwind.

Whirlwind II was not completed, but the AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Central, based on elements of its design, became the command and control system for the SAGE air defense network and Lincoln Laboratory Division 6 participated in this development.

Lincoln Laboratory quickly established a reputation for pioneering advanced electronics in air defense systems. Many of the technical developments that later evolved into improved systems for the airborne detection and tracking of aircraft and ground vehicles have formed the basis for current research.

===Today===
Since MIT Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s establishment, the scope of the problems has broadened from the initial emphasis on air defense to include programs in space surveillance, missile defense, surface surveillance and object identification, communications, cyber security, homeland protection, high-performance computing, air traffic control, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). The core competencies of the laboratory are in sensors, information extraction (signal processing and embedded computing), communications, integrated sensing, and decision support, all supported by a strong advanced electronic technology activity.

Lincoln Laboratory conducts research and development pertinent to national security on behalf of the military services, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other government agencies. Projects focus on the development and prototyping of new technologies and capabilities. Program activities extend from fundamental investigations, through simulation and analysis, to design and field testing of prototype systems. Emphasis is placed on transitioning technology to industry.

The work of Lincoln Laboratory revolves around a comprehensive set of mission areas:
* Space control
* Air, missile, and maritime defense technology
* Communication systems
* Cybersecurity and information sciences
* Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and technology
* Advanced technology
* Tactical systems
* Homeland protection
* Air traffic control
* Engineering

Lincoln Laboratory also undertakes work for non-DoD agencies such as programs in space lasercom and space science, as well as environmental monitoring for NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The dissemination of information to the government, academia, and industry is a principal focus of Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s technical mission. Wide dissemination of technical information is achieved through annual technical workshops, seminars, and courses hosted at the laboratory. Toward the goal of knowledge sharing, the laboratory publishes the &quot;Lincoln Laboratory Journal&quot;, which contains comprehensive articles on current major research and journalistic pieces highlighting novel projects. Other publications include &quot;Tech Notes&quot;, brief descriptions of Laboratory capabilities and technical achievements; the &quot;Annual Report&quot;, which highlights technical accomplishments and ongoing corporate and community outreach initiatives; and an overview brochure &quot;MIT Lincoln Laboratory: Technology in Support of National Security&quot;. Current news about Laboratory technical milestones is featured on the laboratory&#x27;s website.

MIT Lincoln Laboratory maintains a strong relationship with the MIT campus. Ongoing research collaborations, student internship programs, reciprocal seminar series, and cooperative community and educational outreach projects are just a few of the ways the laboratory and the campus share the talents, facilities, and resources of each other.

==Staff and organization==

Approximately 1,700 technical staff members work on research, prototype building, and field demonstrations. The technical staff come from a broad range of scientific and engineering fields, with electrical engineering, physics, computer science and mathematics being among the most prevalent. Two-thirds of the professional staff hold advanced degrees, and 60% of those degrees are at the doctoral level.

The technical work is organized into eight divisions: Air, Missile, &amp; Maritime Defense Technology; Homeland Protection and Air Traffic Control; Cyber Security and Information Sciences; Communication Systems; Engineering; Advanced Technology; Space Systems and Technology; and ISR and Tactical Systems.

Lincoln Laboratory supports its research and development work with an infrastructure of services from six departments: Contracting Services, Facility Services, Financial Services, Information Services, Security Services, and Human Resources. Approximately 1300 people working in the service departments or as technical specialists support the research and development mission of the laboratory.

Lincoln Laboratory supports several community outreach programs. Programs that promote education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics for students in grades kindergarten to high school are offered to the local community and are supported by volunteers from across the laboratory. The Lincoln Laboratory community service program raises awareness of both local and national needs by organizing fund-raising and outreach events that support selected charitable organizations, medical research, and U.S. troops abroad.

===Field sites===
====Lincoln Space Surveillance Complex====
Since 1995, the Lincoln Space Surveillance Complex in Westford, Massachusetts, has played a key role in space situational awareness and the laboratory&#x27;s overall space surveillance mission. The site comprises three major radars – Millstone Deep-Space Tracking Radar (an L-band radar), Haystack Long-Range Imaging Radar (W-band and X-band), and the Haystack Auxiliary Radar (Ku-band). 
Lincoln Laboratory is also engaged in field work at sites in the continental U.S. and the Pacific region.

====Reagan Test Site, Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands====
Lincoln Laboratory serves as the scientific advisor to the Reagan Test Site at the U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll installation located about 2500 miles WSW of Hawaii. The laboratory also supports upgrades to the command-and-control infrastructure of the range to include applications of real-time discrimination and decision aids developed as a result of research at the laboratory.

==== The Experimental Test Site at White Sands Missile Range ====
The Lincoln Laboratory Experimental Test Site (ETS; obs. code: 704) is an electro-optical test facility located on the grounds of the White Sands Missile Range in Socorro, New Mexico. The ETS is operated by the laboratory for the Air Force; its principal mission is the development, evaluation, and transfer of advanced electro-optical space surveillance technologies. The ETS has been a contributing sensor to the U.S. Air Force Space Command. A spin-off program for NASA, Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR), uses the ground-based electro-optical deep-space surveillance telescopes at White Sands to discover comets and asteroids, in particular near-Earth objects. A large percentage share of all known minor planets in the Solar System have been discovered through this program. As of 2020, the Minor Planet Center credits LINEAR with the discovery of 149,793 minor planets from 1997 to 2012. In terms of the total number of discoveries, LINEAR is the most successful asteroid survey program ever conducted.

In 2013, NASA&#x27;s lunar-orbiting Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) carried an optical communications terminal built by Lincoln Laboratory that communicated with a ground terminal at another site at the White Sands Missile Range. This system, the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) transmitted data in both directions at the fastest speeds ever recorded for deep-space communication. The demonstration is now being followed by a number of optical systems that will allow much higher volumes of data transfer for both scientific discovery and human exploration.

<text>The Grand Duchy of Finland, officially and also translated as the Grand Principality of Finland, was the predecessor state of modern Finland. It existed from 1809 to 1917 as an autonomous state within the Russian Empire.

Originating in the 16th century as a titular grand duchy held by the King of Sweden, the country became autonomous after its annexation by Russia in the Finnish War of 1808–1809. The Grand Duke of Finland was the Romanov Emperor of Russia, represented by the Governor-General. Due to the governmental structure of the Russian Empire and Finnish initiative, the Grand Duchy&#x27;s autonomy expanded until the end of the 19th century. The Senate of Finland, founded in 1809, became the most important governmental organ and the precursor to the modern Government of Finland, the Supreme Court of Finland, and the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland.

Economic, social and political changes in the Grand Duchy of Finland paralleled those in the Russian Empire and the rest of Europe. The economy grew slowly during the first half of the 19th century. The reign of Alexander II (1855–1881) saw significant cultural, social and intellectual progress, and an industrializing economy. Tensions increased after Saint Petersburg adopted Russification policies in 1898; the new circumstances saw the reduction of Finnish autonomy and cultural expression. Unrest in Russia and Finland during the First World War (1914–1918) and the subsequent collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917 resulted in the Finnish Declaration of Independence and the end of the Grand Duchy.

==History==

An extended Southwest Finland was made a titular grand duchy in 1581, when King Johan III of Sweden, who as a prince had been the duke of Finland (1556–1561/63), extended the list of subsidiary titles of the kings of Sweden considerably. The new title of grand duke of Finland did not result in any Finnish autonomy, as Finland was an integrated part of the Kingdom of Sweden with full parliamentary representation for its counties. During the next two centuries, the title was used by some of Johan&#x27;s successors on the throne, but not all. Usually, it was just a subsidiary title of the King, used only on very formal occasions. However, in 1802, as an indication of his resolve to keep Finland within Sweden in the face of increased Russian pressure, King Gustav IV Adolf gave the title to his new-born son, Prince Carl Gustaf, who died three years later.

During the Finnish War between Sweden and Russia, the four Estates of occupied Finland were assembled at the Diet of Porvoo on 29 March 1809 to pledge allegiance to &quot;Tsar&quot; Alexander I of Russia, who in return guaranteed that the area&#x27;s laws and liberties, as well as religion, would be left unchanged. Following the Swedish defeat in the war and the signing of the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on 17 September 1809, Finland became a true autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire; but the usual balance of power between monarch and diet resting on taxation was not in place, since the emperor could rely on the rest of his vast empire. The title &quot;Grand Duke of Finland&quot; was added to the long list of titles of the Russian tsar.

After his return to Finland in 1812, the Finnish-born Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt became counsellor to the Russian emperor. Armfelt was instrumental in securing the grand duchy as state with greater autonomy within the Russian Empire, and acquiring so-called Old Finland that Russia had annexed from Sweden in the Treaty of Nystad (1721) and the Treaty of Åbo (1743).

===Beginning of the Grand Duchy===
The formation of the grand duchy stems from the Treaty of Tilsit between Tsar Alexander I of Russia and Emperor Napoleon I of the French. The treaty mediated peace between Russia and France and allied the two countries against Napoleon&#x27;s remaining threats: the United Kingdom and Sweden. Russia invaded Finland in February 1808, claimed as an effort to impose military sanctions against Sweden, but not a war of conquest, and that Russia decided to only temporarily control Finland. Collectively, the Finns were predominately anti-Russian, and Finnish guerrillas and peasant uprisings were a large obstacles for the Russians, forcing Russia to use various tactics to quash armed Finnish rebellion. Thus, in the beginning of the war, &quot;General roda Voysk&quot; Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden, with permission of the tsar, imposed an oath of fealty on Finland, in which Russia would honour Finland&#x27;s Lutheran faith, the Diet of Finland, and the Finnish estates as long as the Finns would remain loyal to the Russian imperial crown. The oath also dubbed anyone person who gave aid to the Swedish or Finnish armies a rebel.

The Finns complied, bitter over Sweden abandoning the country for their war against Denmark and France, and begrudgingly embraced Russian conquest. The Diet of Finland was now to only meet whenever requested, and was never mentioned in the manifesto published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Further on, Alexander I requested a deputation of the four Finnish estates, as he expressed concern over continued Finnish resistance. The deputation refused to act without the Diet, to which Alexander agreed with, and promised the Diet would shortly be summoned. By 1809, all of Finland had been conquered and the Diet was summoned in March. Finland was then united through Russia via the crown, and Finland was able to keep the majority of its own laws, giving it autonomy.

Instead of the newly acquired territory being subjected to direct rule by an imperial governor-general, a novel administrative system was established in Finland, drafted in part by the liberal Mikhail Speransky. The new grand duchy would be governed by a Government Council, later the Senate of Finland, a body made up of Finnish citizens. The governor-general would accordingly have a relatively diminished role. Further, the emperor would deal with matters relating to Finland directly through a dedicated Secretary of State, without the involvement of his Russian cabinet or administration. This laid the foundation for the considerable autonomy enjoyed by Finland for most of the period of Russian rule.

=== Early years ===

The earlier years of the grand duchy can be seen as uneventful. In 1812, the area of Old Finland (known as Viipuri Province from 1812 to 1945) was gifted to Finland. Russia had annexed this territory from Sweden in the Great Northern War and the Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743). This surprising action by the tsar was met with anger from certain parts of the Russian government and aristocracy, who wished to either return to the previous border or annex the communities west of St. Petersburg. Despite the outcry, the borders remained set until 1940. The gesture can be seen as Alexander&#x27;s concern for Finland and his attempts of appeasement of the Finns, in attempts to gain their loyalty which would come from passive appeasement, compared to the vigorous Russification later in the nineteenth-century. Moreover, Alexander moved the capital from Turku to Helsinki, a small fortified town protected by Suomenlinna. Finland&#x27;s main university also transferred to Helsinki after a fire broke out in Turku, destroying most of the building.

Despite promises of a Finnish Diet, the Diet was not called to meet until 1863 and many new laws going through the legislature were laws that would have required the approval of the Diet while under Swedish rule. Alexander went a step further to demand a Finnish House of Nobles, which organised in 1818. The house was designed to register all noble families in Finland so that the highest Finnish estate would be representative of the next Finnish Diet. As for Sweden, the majority did not think too much about Finland&#x27;s conquest, as Sweden itself annexed Norway from Denmark in 1814 and entered a personal union with the nation. Whether or not Alexander purposely ignored the existence of the Diet is debatable, with notable factors such as the fall of Napoleon and the creation of the Holy Alliance, newfound religious mysticism of the Russian crown, and the negative experience with the Polish &quot;Sejm&quot;. Despite this, Alexander I ceased to give in to Finnish affairs and returned to governing Russia.

=== Alexander&#x27;s death and the assimilation of Finland: 1820s–1850s ===


In 1823, Count Arseny Zakrevsky was made Governor-General of Finland and quickly became unpopular among both Finns and Swedes alike. Zakrevsky abolished the Committee for Finnish Affairs and managed to obtain the right to submit Finnish affairs to the Russian emperor, bypassing the Finnish Secretary of State. Two years later, Alexander I died (). Zakrevsky seized the opportunity to require Finland to swear an oath of fealty which would refer to the emperor as the absolute ruler of Finland – expecting that emperor would be Constantine, Alexander&#x27;s next-eldest brother. However, Nicholas, younger brother of Constantine and Alexander, became emperor despite the Decembrist revolt against him in December 1825. Nicholas assured Finland&#x27;s secretary of state, Robert Henrik Rehbinder, that he (Nicholas) would continue to uphold Alexander&#x27;s liberal policies regarding Finland.

In 1830, Europe became a hotbed of revolution and reform as a result of the July Revolution in France. Poland, another Russian client state, saw a massive uprising against Saint Petersburg during the November Uprising of 1830–1831. Finland made no such move, as Russia had already won over Finnish loyalty. Thus, Russia continued its policies respecting Finnish autonomy and the quiet assimilation of the Finns into the empire. Zakrevsky died in 1831; &quot;Knyaz&quot; Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov succeeded him as Governor-General of Finland and continued Finnish appeasement. The appeasement of the Finns could be seen as a prototype of the later Russification, as educated Finns moved to Russia in mass, seeking jobs within the imperial government to rise within Russian imperial society. The Russian language was studied increasingly as well, with more Finns seeking to learn Russian language, politics, culture, and to assimilate into Russian society. Even though Nicholas had no intentions on doing this, his inner office, specifically Nicholas&#x27;s Interior Minister, Lev Perovski (in office: 1841–1852), advocated for Count Zakrevsky&#x27;s ideas and further pushed the ideas of subtle Russification during the 1840s.

However, Finland did experience a nationalistic revolution in the 1830s – one based around literature. This marked the beginning of the Fennoman movement, a nationalistic movement that would operate in Finland until its independence. In 1831, the Finnish Literature Society was founded, which formed on the basis of appreciation of the Finnish language. Finnish was not represented as language of the scholarly elite, as most printed academic works, novels, and poetry was written in either Swedish or Russian. Copying the German reading rage, Lesewut, and subsequent Swedish mania, Finland entered the reading craze by the 1830s. This fad peaked in 1835 with the publication of The &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Finnish epic. The &quot;Kalevala&quot;″s influence on Finland was massive, and strengthened Finnish nationalism and unity, despite the epic being poetry or stories about Finnish folklore. The quest for literature expanded into the 1840s and 1850s and caught the eye of the Finnish church and the Russian crown. Finnish newspapers, such as &quot;Maamiehen Ystävä&quot; (The Farmer&#x27;s Friend), began publication in both urban and rural areas of Finland. However, the Swedish academic elite, the church, and the Russian government opposed Finland&#x27;s literature movement. Edvard Bergenheim, Archbishop of Turku from 1850 to 1884, called for double censorship on works opposing the church and works appearing socialist or communist. The reactionary policies of the Lutheran Church convinced the also reactionary Nicholas I () to prohibit (1850) the publishing of all Finnish works that were not religious or economic in nature, as such works would have been considered revolutionary and might encourage the Finnish majority to revolt against the church and crown. However, the censorship only fueled Finland&#x27;s language strife and the Fennomanian movement.

===Crimean War and 1860s–1870s ===

The works of Johan Snellman and other Fennoman authors combined literature and nationalism and increased the calls for language recognition and education reforms in Finland. This heightened during the Crimean War in which Finnish ports and fortresses on the Baltic Sea became subject for Allied attacks, specifically Suomenlinna and Bomarsund in Åland during the Åland War. As newspapers were printed in Swedish and Russian due to censorship, many Finns could not read about the events of the Battle of Bomarsund and the Battle of Suomenlinna. Moreover, Nicholas I died in 1855, and the new emperor, Alexander II, had already planned educational reforms in outlying territories in Russia, including Finland. Alexander II also planned to call on the Diet of the Estates once more. Under Alexander&#x27;s rule, Finland experienced a period of liberalization in education, the arts, and the economy. In 1858, Finnish was made the official language of local self-government, such as provinces, where Finnish was the majority of the language spoken. However, the Finns feared that St. Petersburg would prevent the Diet from meeting on the basis that Polish and Russian citizens did not receive the same liberties and that the Diet would be eradicated. It was misinterpreted, as it only added a few extra steps to the lawmaking process; the Diet was allowed to stay.

In 1863, Alexander called the Diet and issued that the Finnish language was to be on par with Swedish and Russian in the Grand Duchy, while also passing laws regarding infrastructure and currency. Alexander came to favor the Finnish working class over the Swedish elite, due to Swedish propaganda during the Crimean War urging revolt against the Russians. Alexander also passed a law regarding language ordinance in August 1863, requiring that the Finnish language must be introduced to all public businesses within twenty years. The law was expanded in 1865 to require that state offices must serve the public in Finnish if requested. Despite this, the language laws took time to be fully implemented due to the interference of the Swedish elite, who owned most of these offices and businesses. Despite this, the education laws pushed through and the first secondary schools instructed in Finnish began in the 1870s. The power of the Diet was also expanded in 1869, as it allowed the Diet more power and the ability to initiate various legislation; the act also called the tsar to call upon the Diet every five years. An act passed regarding religion was also passed in 1869 which prevented the power of the state over the church. Moreover, Finland also received its own monetary system, the Finnish markka, and its own army. Finland&#x27;s first railway line was opened between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna on March 17, 1862.

=== Russification ===


The policies of Russification under Alexander III and Nicholas II easily sum up the time period from 1881 to 1917. In 1881, Alexander III took the throne after the death of his father and began a period of staunchly conservative, yet peaceful, rule of Russia. Finland, as well as many other outlying Russian territories, faced the burden of Russification, the cultural, social, economical, and political absorption into Russia. Compared to the early Russification of the 1830s and 1840s, the Russification of the late 19th-early 20th century was much more vigorous in its policies. Moreover, Finland faced political turmoil within its nation between various factions such as liberals, Social Democrats, Young Finns, and communists. Finland became a target for the Pan-Slavist movement, which called for Slavic unity in eastern Europe. Finland was viewed as conquered territory, and that as subjects, Finland was to respect the tsar. Finland was also viewed as a land of settlement and that the &quot;alien race&quot; of the Finns were to be assimilated and protected from Western interference, thereby &quot;blessing&quot; the Finns with their presence. Moreover, Finnish representatives to the tsar were replaced with Pan-Slavist advocates.

Russification only increased from there, but from the 1880s on, the conflict between the Swedish minority halted. Compared to the Baltic States, the Finnish majority was far better educated and more keen in Russian politics. The reactionary policies of Russification, which aimed to combine secular nationalism and a divine right monarchy, infiltrated the Finnish economy in 1885. Finland had managed to create a thriving modern industry based around textiles and timber that managed to rival the Russian economy at the time. Russian bureaucrats, out of both shock and jealousy, called for the revision of the Russo-Finnish Tariff. Russification had taken an economic turn as well, as the basis of the reformed tariff was economic uniformity, which only furthered economic difficulties of Finland. The tariff&#x27;s revision in 1885, and subsequently 1897, was formed out of spite of Finland&#x27;s commercial success and working-class unity. Russification policies continued into 1890, with the addition of the Imperial Post System in Finland, replacing the Finnish post. It was not until the mid-1890s, that the Finnish people realized the true intentions of the Russian crown.

Nicholas II ascended to the throne in 1894 after Alexander&#x27;s death, and with him came General Nikolay Bobrikov, who was appointed governor-general. Under Bobrikov, the Finns had a near collective hatred of him, whose reactionary policies gave rise to socialism and communism among the Finnish working class. The Party of Active Resistance and Kagal, in particular, became very popular in Finland for the former&#x27;s tactics of violence and the latter&#x27;s tactic of propaganda and persuasion. At the beginning of this reign, Bobrikov almost immediately introduced a mandatory five-year military service, in which Finns had the possibility of being drafted into Russian units. Furthermore, he instituted that Russians be given the opportunity to serve in public office and that Russian be made the administrative language of Finland. In 1899, the February Manifesto under Nicholas II declared that Russian law was the law of the land, and Finland was to pledge allegiance to Russian law. The Diet was essentially downgraded to a state assembly and that Finland was a province of Russia, ignoring its autonomy. The Finnish Army as a whole was dissolved in 1901.
Bobrikov unintentionally united both Finns and Swedes against Russia, which only angered him more. With churches refusing to proclaim the law, judges refusing to carry it out, and conscripts refusing service, Bobrikov went on a frenzy with the current state of Finland. Bobrikov found little support in Finland, mainly from the Russian minority and members of the Old Finnish Party. Bobrikov brought in Russian officials to take government and state spots and, in an extreme act of anger, suspended the Finnish Constitution in 1903. His actions were met with extreme anger from Finns and Swedes, in which the moderate parties, the Young Finns and the Swedish Party combined to collectively fight Bobrikov. The Social Democratic Party of Finland, a left-wing party popular among peasants was also extremely hostile and advocated armed resistance. Finally, the Party of Active Resistance, a nationalist party that advocated an armed struggle and guerilla tactics, received fame when member Eugen Schauman assassinated Bobrikov in Helsinki on 16 June 1904.

In 1905, Russia faced a humiliating defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and amidst the turmoil in St. Petersburg, Finns remade their constitution and formed a new parliament whose representation was based on universal suffrage, giving women full suffrage before any other European nation after the short-lived Republic of Corsica. However, the parliament was quickly destroyed by Pyotr Stolypin, Nicholas II&#x27;s prime minister. Stolypin proved to be even more vigorous than Bobrikov, as he believed every subject should be a stoic patriot to the crown and uphold undying loyalty to Russia. Stolypin wished to destroy Finland&#x27;s autonomy and disregarded native tongues and cultures of non-Russian subjects, believing them to be traditional and ritualistic at best. The Finnish parliament once again formed to combat Stolypin, but Stolypin was bent on quashing Finnish insurrection and permanently disbanded the parliament in 1909. As with Bobrikov before him, Stolypin was unaware that such actions only fanned the flames and was subsequently assassinated by Dmitry Bogrov, a Jewish member of the far-left. From Stolypin&#x27;s death henceforward, the Russian crown ruled Finland as a monarchist dictatorship until Russia&#x27;s collapse during the Russian Revolution, from which Finland declared independence, a war of independence that soon transformed into a civil war.

== Government and politics ==

The Russian emperor ruled as the Grand Duke of Finland and was represented in Finland by the Governor-General. The Senate of Finland was the highest governing body of the Grand Duchy and was composed of native Finns. In St. Petersburg Finnish matters were represented by the Minister–Secretary of State for Finland. The Senate had a primarily advisory role until it got the right to representation in 1886. On top of having its own central, regional and local administration, Finland had its own stamps, currency and army.
Alexander I did not want the Grand Duchy to be a constitutional monarchy but the governmental institutions born during the Swedish rule offered him a more efficient form of government than the absolute monarchy in Russia. This evolved into a high level of autonomy by the end of the 19th century.

There were twenty Governors-General from the Finnish War until independence:

* General Count Göran Magnus Sprengtporten 1808–1809
* General &quot;Knyaz&quot; Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly 1809–1810
* General Count Fabian Steinheil 1810–1823
* Count Gustav Mauritz Armfelt 1812–1813
* General Count Arseny Zakrevsky 1823–1831
* Admiral Aleksander Menshikov 1831–1855
* General Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert &quot;Graf&quot; von Berg 1855–1861
* General Baron Platon Rokassovsky 1854–1855, 1861–1866
* General Johan Mauritz Nordenstam 1861, 1864, 1868, 1870, 1872–1873
* General Count Nikolai Adlerberg 1866–1881
* General Count Fyodor Logginovich van Heiden 1881–1897
* General-Lieutenant Stepan Goncharov 1897–1898
* General Nikolai Bobrikov 1898–1904
* General-Lieutenant &quot;Knyaz&quot; Ivan Obolenski 1904–1905
* Privy Councillor Nikolai Gerard 1905–1908
* General Vladimir von Boeckmann 1908–1909
* General-Lieutenant Franz Albert Seyn 1909–1917
* Privy Councilor Adam Lipski 1917
* Mikhail Stakhovich 1917
* Nikolai Nekrasov 1917

=== Provinces ===

The administrative division of the Grand Duchy followed the Russian imperial model with provinces ( &quot;governorate&quot;, , ) headed by governors. Few changes were made however, and as the language of the administrators was still Swedish the old terminology from the Swedish time continued in local use. The Viipuri Province was not initially part of the Grand Duchy, but in 1812 it was transferred by Tsar Alexander I from Russia proper to Finland. After 1831 there were eight provinces in the Grand Duchy until the end and that continued in the independent Finland:

* Turku and Pori Province (, , )
* Kuopio Province (, , )
* Vaasa Province (, , )
* Uusimaa Province (, , )
* Mikkeli Province (, , )
* Häme Province (, , )
* Oulu Province (, , )
* Viipuri Province (, , )

=== Flags ===
The Grand Duchy of Finland had no official flag of its own, but different types of flags were used in different occasions. An official flag was debated even in the Diet of Finland in the 1860s, but one was never officially chosen. The flag of Russia was Finland&#x27;s official flag until independence.

An official maritime flag was chosen in 1812 for governmental use. It was a white flag, with the Russian flag in the upper corner and a compass rose in the middle. In 1883 it was replaced with a blue cross flag with the compass rose in the upper corner. A post flag (a white flag with the Russian flag in the upper corner and a post horn in the middle) was also used in the Grand Duchy, along with a customs flag (a blue flag, with the Russian flag on the upper corner and the logo of the customs agency in the middle).

Originally, there were no regulations regarding merchant flags until 3 October 1821, when Finnish ships were given the right to fly the Russian flag without permission. White, blue and red flags with the Russian flag in the corner were also used. Later on six and nine-striped flags with the colors of the Russian flag twice or thrice saw some use.

A blue cross flag similar to that of the modern flag of Finland was first used by the yacht club Nyländska Jaktklubben in 1861, equipped with the coat of arms of Uusimaa in the upper corner. It was inspired by the similar flag used by the Neva Yacht Club. The flag of the yacht club was made official by the Senate in 1890 when the Swedish-speaking Östra Nylands Segelförening adopted the Flag of Sweden.

At the end of the 19th century, flags with the coat of arms were used in unofficial contexts such as private estates and protests. In official contexts, the Russian white-blue-red tricolour was primarily used.

The Grand Duchy of Finland participated in the 1912 Summer Olympics with their own team. In the opening ceremony, the Finnish team marched behind the Russian team with a Finland-sign. In the medal ceremonies, the Russian flag above a white-blue pennant reading &quot;Finland&quot; was raised for the Finnish athletes.

<text>John Bernard Ball ran as a National Credit Control candidate in the federal 1957 federal election in Canada in the riding of Regina City in Saskatchewan. He won 122 of the 40,813 votes cast (0.3% of the popular vote).

Ball ran to promote &quot;National Credit Control&quot;, a &quot;universal monetary system&quot; that he developed which was similar to social credit.

&quot;National Credit Control&quot; would introduce a credit card system of currency, and nationalize the investment capital of the country. Government would be divorced from industry, and become the central accounting agency for the economy, controlling the master balance sheet of industry. In doing so, all industrial debt would be eliminated, and the government would be placed on a cash basis, without borrowing from its citizens.

The NCC system would guarantee industry against bankruptcy, and abolish unemployment insurance in favour of a full work schedule for all workers. Farmers would be guaranteed the same wages as urban management, and seasonal calamity on farms would be &quot;written off in the nation&#x27;s accounting system&quot;.

NCC would bypass local taxation and abolish taxes on land and buildings. NCC would also abolish taxes on industry, which would be forced to operate at the &quot;labour cost of investment&quot; without profits. Industrial profits would be transferred to the tax assessment. The only taxes in an NCC system would be a consumer sales tax on goods and services. Urban, rural and provincial governments would not raise their own taxes: they would be funded by grants from the federal government. Public works would be tendered to private industry, instead of being undertaken by the government.

Capital goods would be sold to industry on a &quot;lease-rental-depreciation&quot; plan of repayment to perpetuate employment. Profits arising from the rental of buildings would be abolished in the accounting system of private enterprise.

<text>WBNS-TV (channel 10) is a television station in Columbus, Ohio, United States, affiliated with CBS. It is owned by Tegna Inc. alongside the company&#x27;s sole radio properties, WBNS (1460 AM) and WBNS-FM (97.1). The stations share studios on Twin Rivers Drive west of Downtown Columbus, where WBNS-TV&#x27;s transmitter is also located.

WBNS-TV also serves as the CBS affiliate of record for the nearby Zanesville, Ohio, market.

Before its purchase in August 2019 by Tegna, WBNS-TV was the flagship station of founding owner Dispatch Broadcast Group, whose operations also included WTHR, the NBC affiliate in Indianapolis, and WALV-CD, Indianapolis&#x27; MeTV outlet and an alternate NBC affiliate; all of Dispatch&#x27;s stations are now with Tegna.

==History==
=== Until 1995 ===
WBNS-TV began operations on October 15, 1949. WBNS radio had been a CBS Radio Network affiliate for almost 20 years, so Channel 10 immediately joined the CBS television network. It is currently the ninth longest-tenured CBS affiliate. Channel 10 has used the on-air branding of &quot;10TV&quot; since 1977. It is also one of only a few stations in the country to have had the same call letters and primary network affiliation throughout its history.

The WBNS call letters stand for &quot;Wolfe Bank Newspaper and Shoes&quot;, the businesses owned by the company&#x27;s longtime owners, the Wolfe family. Channel 10 maintained common ownership with &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;, the city&#x27;s lone remaining daily newspaper and the &quot;N&quot; in the station&#x27;s call letters, until 2015 under an exemption of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s cross-ownership rules. The FCC has largely prohibited common ownership of co-located print and broadcast media since the mid-1970s. The Wolfe family, who purchased the &quot;Dispatch&quot; in 1905, sold the newspaper and related assets to New Media Investment Group in June 2015.

WBNS-TV was known for its locally produced shows &quot;Flippo the Clown&quot;, &quot;Luci&#x27;s Toyshop&quot;, &quot;Franz the Toymaker&quot;, &quot;The Judge&quot;, and programs hosted by popular Columbus Zoo and Aquarium personality Jack Hanna (&quot;Hanna&#x27;s Ark&quot;). The station also featured &quot;Fritz the Nite Owl,&quot; who hosted midnight movies during the 1970s, and the Sunday state government talk show called &quot;Capital Square&quot; in the 1990s. Throughout much of the 1990s and early years of the millennium, WBNS-TV was home to the &quot;10TV Kids News Network&quot; (KNN); a local show, &quot;produced by kids, for kids.&quot; The half-hour show aired Saturday mornings. Several KNN kids have gone on to pursue careers in television news or public relations in central Ohio.

=== Since 1995 ===

In 1995, WBNS-TV replaced Cleveland&#x27;s WJW-TV as the default affiliate in the Mansfield area (part of the Cleveland–Akron DMA) after WJW became a Fox broadcast outlet. The new Cleveland CBS affiliate, WOIO, unlike WBNS-TV, did not reach Mansfield with a Grade B signal. WBNS also replaced Toledo CBS affiliate WTOL on cable television in the Lima DMA.

The first live high-definition broadcast on the station&#x27;s digital signal took place in September 1998 in which the broadcast was a football game between Ohio State and West Virginia, making the station a pioneer in American digital television. The station claims this to have been the first locally produced HD broadcast in the U.S.; however, as several other stations throughout the country also lay claim to this distinction, the veracity cannot be verified. It is widely considered the first ever live sporting event in HD in the U.S. produced using a production truck and transmission vehicle from NHK, Japan&#x27;s national public broadcasting organization.

Working with sister company Radio Sound Network, WBNS-TV, WBNS (AM) and Ohio News Network (ONN) produced and distributed on a Streaming media platform the Ohio State spring football game in 2001. It was one of the first live sporting events in the U.S. to be streamed. The game was delivered on RealVideo, a compressed video format, on the RealPlayer media player platform on the station&#x27;s website. It also was distributed to Windows Mobile mobile devices using the Windows Media Player format, including Compaq&#x27;s IPAQ personal digital assistant which required an ExpressCard to connect to the Internet.

On June 11, 2019, Dispatch announced it would sell its broadcasting assets, including the WBNS stations, to Tegna Inc. for $535 million in cash, a handsome return on its purchase of WBNS radio in 1929. Coinciding with WBNS-TV&#x27;s 70th anniversary, the deal ended the Wolfe family&#x27;s involvement in local media after over a century. At the time of the sale announcement, channel 10 was the only major television station in Columbus still owned by Ohio-based interests.

The sale was approved by the FCC on July 29, 2019, and was completed on August 8. WBNS-TV became Tegna&#x27;s third television station located in Ohio, operating alongside fellow CBS affiliate WTOL in Toledo and NBC affiliate WKYC in Cleveland.

==Programming==
===Sports programming===
WBNS-TV has strong ties to the athletic department of the Ohio State University. For many years, it has produced the coaches&#x27; shows for both the football and men&#x27;s basketball teams, along with other shows about Ohio State athletics. Additionally, its radio sister has been the flagship station of Ohio State football and basketball for decades. Prior to the launch of the Big Ten Network in September 2007, the station aired Ohio State games offered by ESPN Plus in both sports, including prime time preemptions of CBS network programming for games. Because of the Big Ten Network&#x27;s exclusive contracts to cover live Ohio State sports, WBNS now only carries selected CBS Big Ten basketball broadcasts on weekends and latter portions of the conference tourney, although the programming outside of live sports remains produced by WBNS-TV; WSYX-DT3 and WCMH-TV currently air Ohio State football games through their affiliations with Fox and NBC and those respective networks&#x27; contracts with the Big Ten Conference. Since 2023, WBNS-TV has carried select Ohio State football games through the &quot;Big Ten on CBS&quot; as part of the network&#x27;s new deal with the Big Ten Conference.

===News operation===
WBNS presently broadcasts 37 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday, three hours on Saturdays and four hours on Sundays).

WBNS-TV was the first television station in the Columbus market to debut a news helicopter, &quot;10TV SkyCam&quot; (now &quot;Chopper 10&quot;) in 1979, satellite news truck &quot;10TV Skybeam&quot; in 1986 and launch the Ohio News Network in 1997, which shared studio and office space with WBNS until ONN ended on August 31, 2012.

Appropriately for a station with roots in a newspaper, WBNS-TV had been a consistent ratings leader in programming and news for most of the time since records have been kept. In fact, for many years a popular saying in Columbus was &quot;4 and 6 don&#x27;t equal 10&quot;, referring to WBNS-TV and its rivals, WLWC/WCMH-TV (channel 4) and WTVN-TV/WSYX (channel 6). Since the sale of the station to Tegna, however, WBNS-TV&#x27;s ratings have plummeted, with WCMH-TV and WSYX battling for first, with WSYX edging out WCMH-TV for the top spot.

The first major challenge to Channel 10&#x27;s dominance occurred in 1985, two years after WCMH began featuring the popular anchor team (and then-married couple) of Doug Adair and Mona Scott. From then until the mid-2000s, WBNS-TV and WCMH alternated holding the dominant ratings position for their 11 p.m. newscasts (and were virtually tied for ratings leads). However, since 2002, WBNS-TV has returned to a dominant position due to stronger CBS programming and CBS&#x27; reacquisition of Sunday-afternoon NFL telecasts. WBNS-TV usually rotates games among the two teams with the largest followings in the Columbus market—the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns (both of whom are part of the CBS package for the American Football Conference). When possible, WBNS also airs games of the Pittsburgh Steelers, a division rival of the Bengals and Browns whose fan base extends into portions of the WBNS viewing area.

During Super Bowl XLI, channel 10 debuted a large marketing campaign to promote the launch of &quot;10TV News&quot; in high definition. The song &quot;Carousels (Dreaming of Tomorrow)&quot; by Columbus rock band Alamoth Lane was used throughout the course of the campaign. Some of the band members were shot playing on the roof of WBNS with the Columbus skyline behind them. The song was also used to promote sister station WTHR&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2007.

The station began making preparations for the transition to HD in late March 2007, and debuted its 5 p.m. newscast in high definition on April 2, becoming the first television station in Central Ohio to produce newscasts in HD. The station&#x27;s newscasts are now known as &quot;10TV News&quot;; &quot;10TV News HD&quot; was used from 2007 to 2012, after being known as &quot;10TV Eyewitness News&quot; for many years.

On November 7, 2008, WBNS-TV&#x27;s morning-noon anchor Heather Pick died of breast cancer. Pick learned in 2004 that the disease she overcame in 1999 had returned. In her last public appearance, she hosted the &quot;Spirit Celebration with Heather Pick&quot;, raising almost $500,000 for the Columbus Cancer Clinic.

On January 3, 2011, WBNS expanded its weekday morning newscast to 2 hours, starting at 4:25 a.m. Weekend anchors Jeff Hogan and Angela An replaced Chuck Strickler and Anietra Hamper as anchors, and weeknight 5:30 p.m. anchor Tracy Townsend replaced Hamper and Strickler as noon anchors.

On May 11, 2011, WBNS-TV gained high-profile advertising when WBNS logos and a news ticker replaced those belonging to WCMH-TV on the Casto Building at the corner of High and Broad streets in downtown Columbus. Beginning in 2008, the building was leased by rival station WCMH-TV to house its &quot;NBC 4 on the Square&quot; newscast. When WCMH discontinued the newscast, WBNS assumed the lease but decided not to utilize the street-level studio space.

On October 1, 2012, WBNS-TV launched a redesigned set.

On September 17, 2013, Maria Tiberi, the 21-year-old daughter of WBNS-TV sports director Dom Tiberi, was killed in a car accident along Interstate 270 in Hilliard. Although authorities stated that Maria was distracted at the time of the accident, they did not claim that the distraction was a cell phone. In honor of Maria, WBNS has launched a campaign known as &quot;Maria&#x27;s Message&quot;, an awareness program which aims to prevent such accidents from occurring. On April 8, 2014, the 130th Ohio General Assembly passed Senate Bill 294, which officially designated September as &quot;Safe Driving Awareness Month&quot; in honor of Maria. The bill was signed into law by Governor John Kasich in June of that year.

In December 2019, the station named Ashlee Baracy as Chief Meteorologist, replacing Mike Davis, who was fired following his arrest on child pornography charges.

On March 13, 2020, WBNS-TV adopted Tegna&#x27;s standardized news graphics and &quot;C Clarity&quot; theme, seven months after Tegna acquired the station.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s digital signal is multiplexed:
WBNS-TV broadcasts in Dolby 5.1 and uses its SAP channel for varying purposes, including simulcasts of its radio sister and simulcasts of NOAA weather radio, along with Descriptive Video Service (DVS) and Spanish-language NFL coverage from CBS.

On June 12, 2009, WBNS-TV launched Doppler 10 Now, a weather subchannel, carried on channel 10.2, based on the Local AccuWeather platform. On May 28, 2013, WBNS-TV announced that the 10.2 subchannel would begin carrying Antenna TV. WBNS&#x27; promotions for the network, tagged as &quot;Ridiculously Retro&quot;, showcase clips from &quot;Flippo the Clown&quot; and &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Toyshop&quot;, hinting that old, local favorites could return to the airwaves, but that did not happen. On June 16, 2015, Antenna TV was replaced with Decades on channel 10.2. Then on October 1, 2017, WBNS-TV activated channel 10.3 and moved Decades there, replacing it with Heroes &amp; Icons on channel 10.2. On September 26, 2019, Heroes &amp; Icons was replaced with MeTV on channel 10.2 after WCMH-TV dropped MeTV carriage in favor of Court TV. At midnight on January 1, 2020, Decades was dropped from channel 10.3 and replaced with Dabl. Decades carriage moved to WCBZ-CD channel 22.5. Early in 2023, Circle was replaced with Shop LC on 10.6.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WBNS-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 21, using virtual channel 10.

==Retransmission disputes==
As of September 15, 2012, the high-definition feed for WBNS-TV was dropped from Dish Network due to a contractual dispute between the two sides.

On September 6, 2017, WBNS and Indianapolis sister station WTHR, in both SD and HD formats, were pulled from their respective local AT&amp;T U-verse and DirecTV channel lineups in a dispute over retransmission licensing fees.

<text>The was a Japanese aristocratic class that dominated the Japanese Imperial Court in Kyoto. The &quot;kuge&quot; were important from the establishment of Kyoto as the capital during the Heian period in the late 8th century until the rise of the Kamakura shogunate in the 12th century, at which point it was eclipsed by the &quot;bushi&quot;. The &quot;kuge&quot; still provided a weak court around the Emperor until the Meiji Restoration, when they merged with the &quot;daimyō&quot;, regaining some of their status in the process, and formed the kazoku (peerage), which lasted until shortly after World War II (1947), when the Japanese peerage system was abolished. Though there is no longer an official status, members of the &quot;kuge&quot; families remain influential in Japanese society, government, and industry.

==History==
&quot;Kuge&quot; (from Middle Chinese &quot;kuwng-kæ&quot; 公家, &quot;ducal family&quot;, or &quot;nobility&quot; in a pre–peerage context) originally described the Emperor and his court. The meaning of the word changed over time to designate bureaucrats at the court. During the Heian period, the relative peace and stability provided freedom for the noble class to pursue cultural interests, and the kuge became leaders and benefactors of arts and culture in Japan. Most of the Kuge resided in the capital city of Kyoto.

Later in the Kamakura period (1185–1333), &quot;kuge&quot; became an antonym to &quot;buke&quot; (warrior nobles), that is, samurai who swore loyalty to the shogunate. At this point, &quot;kuge&quot; began to be used to describe those who worked in the Court; both aristocratic noblemen and commoners.

Two classes formed the kuge: the noblemen who sat on the floor with the Emperor; and the who were unable to sit with the Emperor. Although kuge included those two classes, mainly this word described the dōjō, the noblemen.

The highest offices at the court were called &quot;kugyō&quot; and eligibility was limited to members of dōjō kuge. During the Edo period there were about 130 families of dōjō kuge. The most prominent members of the &quot;kuge&quot; became regents to the emperor (&quot;sesshō or kampaku&quot;). These &quot;daijō-kan&quot; offices were restricted to members of the Fujiwara family.

Though they lost most of their political power, they sustained the court culture and maintained a cultural influence. In particular, after the Sengoku period they lost most of their financial basis and were no longer in a position to act as patrons of culture, but they passed on their knowledge as masters of particular fields such as writing waka poetry and playing instruments such as the biwa, and they had disciples among the &quot;daimyō&quot; and sometimes rich commoners. As masters of a certain field, kuge gave their disciples many licenses certifying that the disciples had learned a certain field and allowed them to perform in public or sometimes to teach others. Disciples were expected to pay their master a fee for each issued license. During the Edo period, this was an important source of income for the &quot;kuge&quot;.

In 1869 during the Meiji Restoration the &quot;kuge&quot; merged with the daimyō to form a single aristocratic group, the &quot;kazoku&quot;.

Others associated with the &quot;kuge&quot; included Buddhist priests, Kyoto cultural patrons, geisha, and actors.

==Classification==
The &quot;kuge&quot; were divided into two classes, the higher &quot;dojo&quot; and the lower &quot;jige&quot;. In the 12th century conventional differences were established among the &quot;dōjō&quot;, separating them into groups according to their office at court. These determined the highest office to which they could be appointed. Within the &quot;dojo&quot; class, the groupings were:
#: could be appointed as Sesshō and Kampaku: This was the highest class of kuge. Only five families belonged to this class, all descended from Fujiwara no Michinaga.
#: could be appointed &quot;daijin&quot; (minister), including &quot;daijō-daijin&quot; (chancellor), the highest of the four ministers of the court. They were descended from the Fujiwara clan or Minamoto clan, descendants of the emperors.
#: could be appointed &quot;naidaijin&quot;, if this office became vacant. In reality, the highest office they could normally achieve was &quot;dainagon&quot;.
#: was a military class; they could be appointed &quot;dainagon&quot; or rarely to &quot;naidaijin&quot;.
#: was a civilian class; they could also be appointed &quot;dainagon&quot;.
#: was the lowest class among the dōjō, created in the late Sengoku period. They could only be appointed to lower ranks than &quot;sangi&quot; or &quot;chūnagon&quot;.

The &quot;jige&quot; class was associated with but not a part of the &quot;dojo&quot;: 
*:This class is not a part of all the classes above. Their status is lower than Hanke and they may not enter certain important places in the imperial palace. They are in charge of miscellaneous business in the palace such as cooking and sanitary services. Like other Kuge classes, their positions and ranks in the imperial court are hereditary.
Most of the highest-classed kuge belonged to the Fujiwara clan and Minamoto clan, but there were still other clans like the Sugawara clan, the Kiyohara clan, and the Ōe clan.

<doc id="637602" wikidata="Q201546" url="?curid=637602" title="Diadochi">
<text>The Diadochi (: diadochos) were the rival generals, families, and friends of Alexander the Great who fought for control over his empire after his death in 323 BC. The Wars of the Diadochi mark the beginning of the Hellenistic period from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indus River Valley.

The most notable Diadochi include Ptolemy, Antigonus, Cassander, and Seleucus as the last remaining at the end of the Wars of the Successors, ruling in Egypt, Asia-Minor, Macedon and Persia respectively, all forging dynasties lasting several centuries.

== Background ==
=== Ancient role ===
In ancient Greek, is a noun (substantive or adjective) formed from the verb, &quot;diadechesthai&quot;, &quot;succeed to,&quot; a compound of &quot;dia-&quot; and &quot;dechesthai&quot;, &quot;receive.&quot; The word-set descends straightforwardly from Indo-European *dek-, &quot;receive&quot;, the substantive forms being from the o-grade, *dok-. Some important English reflexes are dogma, &quot;a received teaching,&quot; decent, &quot;fit to be received,&quot; paradox, &quot;against that which is received.&quot; The prefix &quot;dia-&quot; changes the meaning slightly to add a social expectation to the received. The &quot;diadochos&quot;, being a successor in command or any other office, &quot;expects&quot; to receive that office.

==== Basileus ====
It was exactly this expectation that contributed to strife in the Alexandrine and Hellenistic Ages, beginning with Alexander. Philip had married a woman who changed her name to Olympias to honor the coincidence of Philip&#x27;s victory in the Olympic Games and Alexander&#x27;s birth, an act that suggests love may have been a motive as well. Macedon&#x27;s chief office was the &quot;basileia&quot;, or monarchy, the chief officer being the &quot;basileus&quot;, now the signatory title of Philip. Their son and heir, Alexander, was raised with care, being educated by select prominent philosophers. Philip is said to have wept for joy when Alexander performed a feat of which no one else was capable, taming the wild horse, Bucephalus, at his first attempt in front of a skeptical audience including the king. Amidst the cheering onlookers Philip swore that Macedonia was not large enough for Alexander.

Philip built Macedonia into the leading military state of the Balkans. He had acquired his expertise fighting for Thebes and Greek freedom under his patron, Epaminondas. When Alexander was a teenager, Philip was planning a military solution to the contention with the Persian Empire. In the opening campaign against Byzantium he made Alexander &quot;regent&quot; (&quot;kurios&quot;) in his absence. Alexander used every opportunity to further his father&#x27;s victories, expecting that he would be a part of them. At the report of each of Philip&#x27;s victories, Alexander was said to lament that his father would leave him nothing of note to do.

There was a source of disaffection, however. Plutarch reports that Alexander and his mother bitterly reproached him for his numerous affairs among the women of his court. Philip then fell in love and married a young woman, Cleopatra, when he was too old for marriage. (Macedonian kings traditionally had multiple wives.) Alexander was at the wedding banquet when Attalus, Cleopatra&#x27;s uncle, made a remark that seemed inappropriate to him. He asked the Macedonians to pray for an &quot;heir to the kingship&quot; (&quot;diadochon tes basileias&quot;). Rising to his feet Alexander shouted, using the royal &quot;we,&quot; &quot;Do we seem like bastards (&quot;nothoi&quot;) to you, evil-minded man?&quot; and threw a cup at him. The inebriated Philip, rising to his feet and drawing his sword to defend Attalus, promptly fell. Making a comment that the man who was preparing to cross from Europe to Asia could not cross from one couch to another, Alexander departed, to escort his mother to her native Epirus and to wait himself in Illyria. Not long after, prompted by Demaratus the Corinthian to mend the dissension in his house, Philip sent Demaratus to bring Alexander home. The expectation by virtue of which Alexander was &quot;diadochos&quot; was that as the son of Philip, he would inherit Philip&#x27;s throne.

In 336 BC Philip was assassinated, and the 20-year-old Alexander &quot;received the kingship&quot; (&quot;parelabe ten basileian&quot;). In the same year Darius succeeded to the throne of Persia as &quot;Šâhe Šâhân&quot;, &quot;King of Kings,&quot; which the Greeks understood as &quot;Great King.&quot; The role of the Macedonian &quot;basileus&quot; was changing fast. Alexander&#x27;s army was already multinational. Alexander was acquiring dominion over state after state. His presence on the battlefield seemed to ensure immediate victory.

==== Hegemon ====

When Alexander the Great died on June 10, 323 BC, he left behind a huge empire which comprised many essentially independent territories. Alexander&#x27;s empire stretched from his homeland of Macedon itself, along with the Greek city-states that his father had subdued, to Bactria and parts of India in the east. It included parts of the present day Balkans, Anatolia, the Levant, Egypt, Babylonia, and most of the former Achaemenid Empire, except for some lands the Achaemenids formerly held in Central Asia.

== Successors ==
The hetairoi (), or companion cavalry, added flexibility to the ancient Macedonian army. The hetairoi were a special cavalry unit composed of general officers without fixed rank, whom Alexander could assign where needed. They were typically from the nobility; many were related to Alexander. A parallel flexible structure in the Achaemenid army facilitated combined units.

Staff meetings to adjust command structure were nearly a daily event in Alexander&#x27;s army. They created an ongoing expectation among the hetairoi of receiving an important and powerful command, if only for a short term. At the moment of Alexander&#x27;s death, all possibilities were suddenly suspended. The hetairoi vanished with Alexander, to be replaced instantaneously by the Diadochi, men who knew where they had stood, but not where they would stand now. As there had been no definite ranks or positions of hetairoi, there were no ranks of Diadochi. They expected appointments, but without Alexander they would have to make their own.

For purposes of this presentation, the Diadochi are grouped by their rank and social standing at the time of Alexander&#x27;s death. These were their initial positions as Diadochi.

=== Craterus ===

Craterus was an infantry and naval commander under Alexander during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire. After the revolt of his army at Opis on the Tigris in 324, Alexander ordered Craterus to command the veterans as they returned home to Macedonia. Antipater, commander of Alexander&#x27;s forces in Greece and regent of the Macedonian throne in Alexander&#x27;s absence, would lead a force of fresh troops back to Persia to join Alexander while Craterus would become regent in his place. When Craterus arrived at Cilicia in 323 BC, news reached him of Alexander&#x27;s death. Though his distance from Babylon prevented him from participating in the distribution of power, Craterus hastened to Macedonia to assume the protection of Alexander&#x27;s family. The news of Alexander&#x27;s death caused the Greeks to rebel in the Lamian War. Craterus and Antipater defeated the rebellion in 322 BC. Despite his absence, the generals gathered at Babylon confirmed Craterus as Guardian of the Royal Family. However, with the royal family in Babylon, the Regent Perdiccas assumed this responsibility until the royal household could return to Macedonia.

=== Antipater ===

Antipater was an adviser to King Philip II, Alexander&#x27;s father, a role he continued under Alexander. When Alexander left Macedon to conquer Persia in 334 BC, Antipater was named Regent of Macedon and General of Greece in Alexander&#x27;s absence. In 323 BC, Craterus was ordered by Alexander to march his veterans back to Macedon and assume Antipater&#x27;s position while Antipater was to march to Persia with fresh troops. Alexander&#x27;s death that year, however, prevented the order from being carried out. When Alexander&#x27;s generals gathered at the Partition of Babylon to divide the empire between themselves, Antipater was confirmed as General of Greece while the roles of Regent of the Empire and Guardian of the Royal Family were given to Perdiccas and Craterus, respectively. Together, the three men formed the top ruling group of the empire.

=== Somatophylakes ===
The Somatophylakes were the seven bodyguards of Alexander.

=== Macedonian satraps ===
Satraps (Old Persian: &quot;xšaθrapāwn&quot;) were the governors of the provinces in the Hellenistic empires.

=== Royal family ===
=== Non-Macedonian satraps and generals ===
=== The &quot;Epigoni&quot; ===

Originally the Epigoni (/ɪˈpɪɡənaɪ/; from &quot;offspring&quot;) were the sons of the Argive heroes who had fought in the first Theban war. In the 19th century the term was used to refer to the second generation of Diadochi rulers.

==Chronology==

=== Struggle for unity (323–319 BC) ===

==== Partition of Babylon ====
Without a clear successor, Alexander&#x27;s generals quickly began to dispute the rule of his empire. The two contenders were Alexander&#x27;s half-brother Arrhidaeus and his unborn child with Roxana. Meleager and the infantry supported Arrhidaeus while Perdiccas and the cavalry supported waiting until the birth of Roxana&#x27;s child.

A compromise was arranged, with Arrhidaeus being crowned as Philip III. If Roxana&#x27;s child was a son, they would rule jointly. Perdiccas was named Regent and Meleager as his lieutenant. Eventually, Roxana did give birth to Alexander&#x27;s son, Alexander IV. However, Perdiccas had Meleager and the other infantry leaders murdered and assumed full control.

Perdiccas, summoned a council of the great men of Alexander&#x27;s court to appoint satraps for the parts of the Empire in the partition of Babylon. Ptolemy received Egypt; Laomedon received Syria and Phoenicia; Philotas took Cilicia; Peithon took Media; Antigonus received Phrygia, Lycia and Pamphylia; Asander received Caria; Menander received Lydia; Lysimachus received Thrace; Leonnatus received Hellespontine Phrygia; and Neoptolemus had Armenia. Macedon and the rest of Greece were to be jointly ruled by Antipater and Craterus, while Alexander&#x27;s former secretary, Eumenes of Cardia, was to receive Cappadocia and Paphlagonia.

Alexander&#x27;s arrangements in the east were left intact. Taxiles and Porus governed over their kingdoms in India; Alexander&#x27;s father-in-law Oxyartes governed Gandara; Sibyrtius governed Arachosia and Gedrosia; Stasanor governed Aria and Drangiana; Philip governed Bactria and Sogdia; Phrataphernes governed Parthia and Hyrcania; Peucestas governed Persis; Tlepolemus had charge over Carmania; Atropates governed northern Media; Archon got Babylonia; and Arcesilaus governed northern Mesopotamia.

==== Revolt in Greece ====

Meanwhile, the news of Alexander&#x27;s death had inspired a revolt in Greece, known as the Lamian War. Athens and other cities joined, ultimately besieging Antipater in the fortress of Lamia. Antipater was relieved by a force sent by Leonnatus, who was killed in action, but the war did not come to an end until Craterus&#x27;s arrival with a fleet to defeat the Athenians at the Battle of Crannon on September 5, 322 BC. For a time, this brought an end to any resistance to Macedonian domination. Meanwhile, Peithon suppressed a revolt of Greek settlers in the eastern parts of the Empire, and Perdiccas and Eumenes subdued Cappadocia.

==== First War of the Diadochi (322–320 BC) ====

Soon, however, conflict broke out. Perdiccas&#x27; marriage to Alexander&#x27;s sister Cleopatra led Antipater, Craterus, Antigonus, and Ptolemy to join in rebellion. The actual outbreak of war was initiated by Ptolemy&#x27;s theft of Alexander&#x27;s body and its transfer to Egypt. Although Eumenes defeated the rebels in Asia Minor, in a battle at which Craterus was killed, it was all for nought, as Perdiccas himself was murdered by his own generals Peithon, Seleucus, and Antigenes during an invasion of Egypt.

Ptolemy came to terms with Perdiccas&#x27;s murderers, making Peithon and Arrhidaeus regents in his place, but soon these came to a new agreement with Antipater at the Partition of Triparadisus. Antipater was made regent of the Empire, and the two kings were moved to Macedon. Antigonus remained in charge of Phrygia, Lycia, and Pamphylia, to which was added Lycaonia. Ptolemy retained Egypt, Lysimachus retained Thrace, while the three murderers of Perdiccas—Seleucus, Peithon, and Antigenes—were given the provinces of Babylonia, Media, and Susiana respectively. Arrhidaeus, the former Regent, received Hellespontine Phrygia. Antigonus was charged with the task of rooting out Perdiccas&#x27;s former supporter, Eumenes. In effect, Antipater retained for himself control of Europe, while Antigonus, as leader of the largest army east of the Hellespont, held a similar position in Asia.

==== Partition of Triparadisus ====
==== Death of Antipater ====
Soon after the second partition, in 319 BC, Antipater died. Antipater had been one of the few remaining individuals with enough prestige to hold the empire together. After his death, war soon broke out again and the fragmentation of the empire began in earnest. Passing over his own son, Cassander, Antipater had declared Polyperchon his successor as Regent. A civil war soon broke out in Macedon and Greece between Polyperchon and Cassander, with the latter supported by Antigonus and Ptolemy. Polyperchon allied himself to Eumenes in Asia, but was driven from Macedonia by Cassander, and fled to Epirus with the infant king Alexander IV and his mother Roxana. In Epirus he joined forces with Olympias, Alexander&#x27;s mother, and together they invaded Macedon again. They were met by an army commanded by King Philip Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice, which immediately defected, leaving the king and Eurydice to Olympias&#x27;s not so tender mercies, and they were killed (317 BC). Soon after, though, the tide turned, and Cassander was victorious, capturing and killing Olympias, and attaining control of Macedon, the boy king, and his mother.

=== Wars of the Diadochi (319–275 BC) ===

The Wars of the Diadochi were a series of conflicts, fought between 322 and 275 BC, over the rule of Alexander&#x27;s empire after his death.

In 310 BC Cassander secretly murdered Alexander IV and Roxana.

====The Battle of Ipsus (301 BC)====
The Battle of Ipsus at the end of the Fourth War of the Diadochi finalized the breakup of the unified Empire of Alexander. Antigonus I Monophthalmus and his son Demetrius I of Macedon were pitted against the coalition of three other companions of Alexander: Cassander, ruler of Macedon; Lysimachus, ruler of Thrace; and Seleucus I Nicator, ruler of Babylonia and Persia. Antigonus was killed, but his son Demetrius took a large part of Macedonia and continued his father&#x27;s dynasty. After the death of Cassander and Lysimachus, following one another in fairly rapid succession, the Ptolemies and Seleucids controlled the vast majority of Alexander&#x27;s former empire, with a much smaller segment controlled by the Antigonid dynasty until the 1st century.

== The &quot;Epigoni&quot; ==

=== Kingdoms of the Diadochi (275–30 BC) ===
==== Ptolemaic Egypt ====

Under the rule of its first three monarchs Ptolemy I Soter, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, and Ptolemy III Euergetes, Ptolemaic Egypt reached its zenith of power and prestige in its first eighty years of existence, while heading off a number of crises and challenges along the way. The reign of Ptolemy IV Philopator (221–203 BC)is marked by historians as the beginning of the decline of Ptolemaic Egypt. However, the kingdom would persist for another 200 years.

The Ptolemaic rulers gradually embraced Egyptian traditions, such as sibling royal marriages, which the Ptolemaic dynasty frequently partook in. The cosmopolitan nature of Ptolemaic Egypt can be seen with the Rosetta Stone, an edict ordered by Ptolemy V Epiphanes (204–180 BC), would be written in three languages: Egyptian hieroglyphs, Coptic, and Greek. However, the Ptolemaic rulers&#x27; insistence on the incorporation of Greek influences into Egyptian society led to many peasant revolts and uprisings throughout the course of the kingdom&#x27;s existence.

====Seleucid Empire====

====Antigonid Macedonia====
=== Decline and fall ===
This division was to last for a century, before the Antigonid Kingdom finally fell to the Roman Republic, and the Seleucids were harried from Persia by the Parthians and forced by the Romans to relinquish control in Asia Minor. A rump Seleucid kingdom survived in Syria until finally conquered by Pompey in 64 BC. The Ptolemies lasted longer in Alexandria, though as a client under Rome. Egypt was finally annexed to Rome in 30 BC.

=== Aulic ===
In the formal &quot;court&quot; titulature of the Hellenistic empires ruled by dynasties we know as Diadochs, the title was not customary for the Monarch, but has actually been proven to be the &quot;lowest&quot; in a system of official rank titles, known as Aulic titulature, conferred – ex officio or nominatim – to actual courtiers &quot;and&quot; as an honorary rank (for protocol) to various military and civilian officials. Notably in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, it was reported as the lowest aulic rank, under Philos, during the reign of Ptolemy V Epiphanes.

=== Modern concept ===
Diadochi (Διάδοχοι) is an ancient Greek word that currently modern scholars use to refer primarily to persons acting a role that existed only for a limited time period and within a limited geographic range. As there are no modern equivalents, it has been necessary to reconstruct the role from the ancient sources. There is no uniform agreement concerning exactly which historical persons fit the description, or the territorial range over which the role was in effect, or the calendar dates of the period. A certain basic meaning is included in all definitions, however.

The New Latin terminology was introduced by the historians of universal Greek history of the 19th century. Their comprehensive histories of ancient Greece typically covering from prehistory to the Roman Empire ran into many volumes. For example, George Grote in the first edition of &quot;History of Greece&quot;, 1846–1856, hardly mentions the Diadochi, except to say that they were kings who came after Alexander and Hellenized Asia. In the edition of 1869 he defines them as &quot;great officers of Alexander, who after his death carved kingdoms for themselves out of his conquests.&quot;

Grote cites no references for the use of Diadochi but his criticism of Johann Gustav Droysen gives him away. Droysen, &quot;the modern inventor of Hellenistic history,&quot; not only defined &quot;Hellenistic period&quot; (&quot;hellenistische ... Zeit&quot;), but in a further study of the &quot;successors of Alexander&quot; (&quot;nachfolger Alexanders&quot;) dated 1836, after Grote had begun work on his history, but ten years before publication of the first volume, divided it into two periods, &quot;the age of the Diadochi,&quot; or &quot;Diadochi Period&quot; (&quot;die Zeit der Diodochen&quot; or &quot;Diadochenzeit&quot;), which ran from the death of Alexander to the end of the &quot;Diadochi Wars&quot; (&quot;Diadochenkämpfe&quot;, his term), about 278 BC, and the &quot;Epigoni Period&quot; (&quot;Epigonenzeit&quot;), which ran to about 220 BC. He also called the Diadochi Period &quot;the Diadochi War Period&quot; (&quot;Zeit der Diadochenkämpfe&quot;). The Epigoni he defined as &quot;Sons of the Diadochi&quot; (&quot;Diadochensöhne&quot;). These were the second generation of Diadochi rulers. In an 1843 work, &quot;History of the Epigoni&quot; (&quot;Geschichte der Epigonen&quot;) he details the kingdoms of the Epigoni, 280-239 BC. The only precise date is the first, the date of Alexander&#x27;s death, June, 323 BC. It has never been in question.

Grote uses Droysen&#x27;s terminology but gives him no credit for it. Instead he attacks Droysen&#x27;s concept of Alexander planting Hellenism in eastern colonies: &quot;Plutarch states that Alexander founded more than seventy new cities in Asia. So large a number of them is neither verifiable nor probable, unless we either reckon up simple military posts or borrow from the list of foundations really established by his successors.&quot; He avoids Droysen&#x27;s term in favor of the traditional &quot;successor&quot;. In a long note he attacks Droysen&#x27;s thesis as &quot;altogether slender and unsatisfactory.&quot; Grote may have been right, but he ignores entirely Droysen&#x27;s main thesis, that the concepts of &quot;successors&quot; and &quot;sons of successors&quot; were innovated and perpetuated by historians writing contemporaneously or nearly so with the period. Not enough evidence survives to prove it conclusively, but enough survives to win acceptance for Droysen as the founding father of Hellenistic history.

M. M. Austin localizes what he considers to be a problem with Grote&#x27;s view. To Grote&#x27;s assertion in the Preface to his work that the period &quot;is of no interest in itself,&quot; but serves only to elucidate &quot;the preceding centuries,&quot; Austin comments &quot;Few nowadays would subscribe to this view.&quot; If Grote was hoping to minimize Droysen by not giving him credit, he was mistaken, as Droysen&#x27;s gradually became the majority model. By 1898 Adolf Holm incorporated a footnote describing and evaluating Droysen&#x27;s arguments. He describes the Diadochi and Epigoni as &quot;powerful individuals.&quot; The title of the volume on the topic, however, is &quot;The Graeco-Macedonian Age...&quot;, not Droysen&#x27;s &quot;Hellenistic&quot;.

Droysen&#x27;s &quot;Hellenistic&quot; and &quot;Diadochi Periods&quot; are canonical today. A series of six (as of 2014) international symposia held at different universities 1997–2010 on the topics of the imperial Macedonians and their Diadochi have to a large degree solidified and internationalized Droysen&#x27;s concepts. Each one grew out of the previous. Each published an assortment of papers read at the symposium. The 2010 symposium, entitled &quot;The Time of the Diadochi (323-281 BC),&quot; held at the University of A Coruña, Spain, represents the current concepts and investigations. The term Diadochi as an adjective is being extended beyond its original use, such as &quot;Diadochi Chronicle,&quot; which is nowhere identified as such, or Diadochi kingdoms, &quot;the kingdoms that emerged,&quot; even past the Age of the Epigoni.

<text>Radio Fun was a British celebrity comics comic paper that ran from (issues dates) 15 October 1938 to 18 February 1961, when it became the first out of twelve titles to merge with &quot;Buster&quot;.

The comic strips included the uncredited work of industry regulars such as Roy Wilson and George and Reg Parlett. The format of the humorous strips was to pack in as many gags and slapstick situations as possible. 

== Publication history ==
&quot;Wonder&quot; merged with it in 1953.

The title became &quot;Radio Fun and Adventures&quot; towards the end of its run.

&quot;Radio Fun&quot; ran for 1167 issues.

== Strips ==
The comic mainly featured comic strip versions of radio and film stars, including:
* Arthur Askey
* Benny Hill
* Bernard Bresslaw
* Charlie Chester
* Petula Clark
* Charlie Drake
* Clark Gable
* Tommy Handley
* Jimmy Jewel and Ben Warriss
* Tom Keene
* Sandy Powell
* Jack Warner
* Norman Wisdom

In its last few years, it ran a &quot;Superman&quot; strip abridged and reformatted from DC Comics. Other later cover strips were &quot;The Falcon&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.

<text>Halton Christian &quot;Chip&quot; Arp (March 21, 1927 – December 28, 2013) was an American astronomer. He is remembered for his 1966 book &quot;Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies&quot;, which catalogued unusual looking galaxies and presented their images. 

Arp was also known as a critic of the Big Bang theory and for advocating a non-standard cosmology incorporating intrinsic redshift. Arp developed those views in a book, &quot;Seeing Red: Redshift, Cosmology and Academic Science&quot; in 1998. 

==Biography==
Arp was born on March 21, 1927, in New York City. He was married three times, has four daughters, including comic artist Andrice Arp, and five grandchildren. 

His bachelor&#x27;s degree was awarded by Harvard (1949), and his PhD by Caltech (1953). Afterward he became a Fellow of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1953, performing research at the Mount Wilson Observatory and Palomar Observatory. Arp became a research assistant at Indiana University in 1955, and then in 1957 became a staff member at Palomar Observatory, where he worked for 29 years. In 1983 he stopped obtaining observing time on the Palomar telescopes, due in part to his unorthodox theories but also because he refused to submit observing proposals, on the grounds that everybody knew what he was doing. As a reaction, he took early retirement and joined the staff of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany.

He died in Munich, Germany on December 28, 2013. He was an atheist.

==&quot;Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies&quot;==

Arp compiled a catalog of unusual galaxies titled &quot;Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies&quot;, which was first published in 1966. Arp&#x27;s motivation for the project was his realization that astronomers understood little about how galaxies change over time. This atlas was intended to provide images that would give astronomers data from which they could study the evolution of galaxies. Arp later used the galaxies of the atlas as arguments for his views in the debate on quasi-stellar objects (QSOs).

Astronomers now recognize Arp&#x27;s atlas as an excellent compilation of interacting and merging galaxies, with some admixture of chance alignments of two unrelated objects at vastly different distances. Many objects in the atlas are referred to primarily by their Arp number, and some (particularly Arp 220) are used as spectral templates for studying high-redshift galaxies. Arp himself totally rejected the idea that the peculiar galaxies were merging, claiming, rather, that apparent associations were prime examples of ejections from a host galaxy.

==Quasars and redshifts==
During the 1950s bright radio sources, now known as quasars, had been discovered that did not appear to have an optical counterpart. In 1960 one of these sources, 3C 48, was found to be associated with what appeared to be a small blue star. When the spectrum of the star was measured, it contained unidentifiable spectral lines that defied all attempts at explanation; John Gatenby Bolton&#x27;s suggestion that these were highly redshifted sources was not widely accepted. In 1963 Maarten Schmidt found a visible companion to the quasar 3C 273. Using the Hale Telescope, Schmidt found the same odd spectra, but was able to demonstrate that it could be explained as the spectrum of hydrogen, shifted by a very large 15.8% If this was due to the physical motion of the &quot;star&quot;, it would represent a speed of 47,000 km/s, far beyond the speed of any known star and defying an obvious explanation. Schmidt noted that redshift is also associated with the expansion of the universe, as codified in Hubble&#x27;s law. If the measured redshift was due to expansion, then the object in question would have to be very far away, and therefore have an extraordinarily high luminosity, equally beyond any object seen to date. This extreme luminosity would also explain the large radio signal. Schmidt concluded quasars are very distant, very luminous objects. Schmidt&#x27;s explanation for the high redshift was not universally accepted at the time. Another explanation that was offered was that it was gravitational redshift that was being measured. Several other mechanisms were proposed as well, each with their own problems.

In 1966, Arp published the &quot;Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies&quot;, which contained photographs of 338 nearby galaxies that did not fall into any of the classic categories of galaxy shapes. His goal was to produce a selection that modellers could use in order to test theories of galactic formation. By testing against the collection, one could quickly see how well a particular theory stood up. One group of these, numbers 1 through 101, were otherwise conventional galaxies that appeared to have small companion objects of unknown origin. In 1967 Arp noted that several of these objects appeared on the list of quasars. In some photographs a quasar is in the foreground of known galaxies, and in others there appeared to be matter bridging the two objects, implying they are very close in space. If they are, and the redshifts were due to Hubble expansion, then both objects should have similar redshifts. The galaxies had much smaller redshifts than the quasars. Arp also noted that quasars were not evenly spread over the sky, but tended to be more commonly found in positions of small angular separation from certain galaxies. This being the case, they might be in some way related to the galaxies. Arp argued that the redshift was not due to Hubble expansion or physical movement of the objects, but must have a non-cosmological or &quot;intrinsic&quot; origin, and that quasars were local objects ejected from the core of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Nearby galaxies with both strong radio emission and peculiar morphologies, particularly M87 and Centaurus A, appeared to support Arp&#x27;s hypothesis.

Since the 1960s, telescopes and astronomical instrumentation have advanced greatly: the Hubble Space Telescope was launched, and cosmological theory and observation has advanced considerably. Black holes and supermassive black holes have been directly as well as indirectly detected, extremely distant objects are routinely studied and contextualized, and multiple 8-10 meter telescopes (such as those at Keck Observatory and the Very Large Telescope) have become operational, and detectors such as CCDs are now more widely employed. These developments, have led to quasars being understood to be very distant active galaxies with high redshifts. Many imaging surveys, most notably the Hubble Deep Field, have found many high-redshift objects that are not QSOs but that appear to be normal galaxies like those found nearby. The spectra of the high-redshift galaxies, as seen from X-ray to radio wavelengths, match the spectra of nearby galaxies (particularly galaxies with high levels of star formation activity but also galaxies with normal or extinguished star formation activity) when corrected for redshift effects.

Arp never wavered from his stand against the Big Bang, and until shortly before his death in 2013, he continued to publish articles stating his contrary view in both popular and scientific literature, frequently collaborating with Geoffrey Burbidge (until Burbidge&#x27;s death in 2010) and Margaret Burbidge. He explained his reasons for believing that the Big Bang theory is wrong, citing his research into quasars or quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). Instead, Arp supported the redshift quantization theory as an explanation of the redshifts of galaxies.

As more recent experiments have expanded the amount of collected data by orders of magnitude Arp&#x27;s theories can now be scrutinized further. For instance a recent study by Tang and Zhang about the periodicity of redshifts (a hypothesis articulated by Arp) stated that:

:&quot;... the publicly available data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF QSO redshift survey to test the hypothesis that QSOs are ejected from active galaxies with periodic noncosmological redshifts. For two different intrinsic redshift models, [...] and find there is no evidence for a periodicity at the predicted frequency in log(1+z), or at any other frequency.&quot;

However, a follow-up study by Bell and McDiarmid shows that Arp&#x27;s hypothesis about the periodicity in red-shifts cannot be discarded easily. The authors argue that
:&quot;The Tang and Zhang (2005) analysis could thus have missed, or misidentified, many of the parent galaxies, which could explain why the pairs they found differed little from what would be expected for a random distribution. In spite of this, although it was not pointed out by these authors, their pairs did show a slight excess near the expected value of 200 kpc….In fact, most of the conclusions reached by Tang and Zhang (2005) appear to have resulted because they have assumed that many of the values [that they have used] are much more accurate than they really are. …[we found by examining 46400 quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey that] the locations of the peaks in the redshift distribution are in agreement with the preferred redshifts predicted by the intrinsic redshift equation&quot;
In a 2009 paper Bell and Comeau retracted the claim that these features were due to redshift periodicity, and acknowledged that they are caused by subtle selection biases. The SDSS team had previously described these effects, and shown that the apparent peaks in the redshift distribution disappear when restricted to a highly-complete subsample of quasars.

==Honors and awards==
In 1960, Arp was awarded the Helen B. Warner Prize for Astronomy by the American Astronomical Society, a prize &quot;normally awarded annually for a significant contribution to observational or theoretical astronomy during the five years preceding the award.&quot;

In the same year, Arp was awarded the Newcomb Cleveland Prize for his address, &quot;The Stellar Content of Galaxies&quot;, read before a joint session of the American Astronomical Society and AAAS Section D.

In 1984, he was awarded the Alexander von Humboldt Senior Scientist Award.

<doc id="637623" wikidata="Q1048886" url="?curid=637623" title="Glass ceiling">
<text>A glass ceiling is a metaphor usually applied to women, used to represent an invisible barrier that prevents a given demographic from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy. The metaphor was first used by feminists in reference to barriers in the careers of high-achieving women. It was coined by Marilyn Loden during a speech in 1978.

In the United States, the concept is sometimes extended to refer to racial inequality. Minority women in white-majority countries often find the most difficulty in &quot;breaking the glass ceiling&quot; because they lie at the intersection of two historically marginalized groups: women and people of color. East Asian and East Asian American news outlets have coined the term &quot;bamboo ceiling&quot; to refer to the obstacles that all East Asian Americans face in advancing their careers. Similarly, a multitude of barriers that refugees and asylum seekers face in their search for meaningful employment is referred to as the &quot;canvas ceiling&quot;.

Within the same concepts of the other terms surrounding the workplace, there are similar terms for restrictions and barriers concerning women and their roles within organizations and how they coincide with their maternal responsibilities. These &quot;Invisible Barriers&quot; function as metaphors to describe the extra circumstances that women go through, usually when they try to advance within areas of their careers and often while they try to advance within their lives outside their work spaces.

&quot;A glass ceiling&quot; represents a blockade that prohibits women from advancing toward the top of a hierarchical corporation. These women are prevented from getting promoted, especially to the executive rankings within their corporation. In the last twenty years, the women who have become more involved and pertinent in industries and organizations have rarely been in the executive ranks.

== Definition ==
The United States Federal Glass Ceiling Commission (1991–1996) defined the glass ceiling as &quot;the unseen, yet unbreachable barrier that keeps minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder, regardless of their qualifications or achievements.&quot;

David Cotter et al. (2001) defined four distinctive characteristics that must be met to conclude that a &quot;glass ceiling&quot; exists. A glass ceiling inequality represents:
# &quot;A gender or racial difference that is not explained by other job-relevant characteristics of the employee.&quot;
# &quot;A gender or racial difference that is greater at higher levels of an outcome than at lower levels of an outcome.&quot;
# &quot;A gender or racial inequality in the chances of advancement into higher levels, not merely the proportions of each gender or race currently at those higher levels.&quot;
# &quot;A gender or racial inequality that increases over the course of a career.&quot;
Cotter and colleagues found that glass ceilings are correlated strongly with gender, with both white and minority women facing a glass ceiling in the course of their careers. In contrast, the researchers did not find evidence of a glass ceiling for African-American men.

The glass ceiling metaphor has often been used to describe invisible barriers (&quot;glass&quot;) through which women can see elite positions but cannot reach them (&quot;ceiling&quot;). These barriers prevent large numbers of women and ethnic minorities from obtaining and securing the most powerful, prestigious and highest-grossing jobs in the workforce. Moreover, this effect prevents women from filling high-ranking positions and puts them at a disadvantage as potential candidates for advancement.

== History ==
In 1839, French feminist and author George Sand used a similar phrase, &quot;une voûte de cristal impénétrable&quot;, in a passage of &quot;Gabriel&quot;, a never-performed play: &quot;I was a woman; for suddenly my wings collapsed, ether closed in around my head like &quot;an impenetrable crystal vault&quot;, and I fell...&quot; [emphasis added]. The statement, a description of the heroine&#x27;s dream of soaring with wings, has been interpreted as a feminine Icarus tale of a woman who attempts to ascend above her accepted role.

Marilyn Loden invented the phrase &quot;glass ceiling&quot; during a 1978 speech.

According to the April 3, 2015, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; the term glass ceiling was notably used in 1979 by Maryanne Schriber and Katherine Lawrence at Hewlett-Packard. Lawrence outlined the concept at the National Press Club at the national meeting of the Women&#x27;s Institute for the Freedom of the Press in Washington DC. The ceiling was defined as discriminatory promotion patterns where the written promotional policy is non-discriminatory, but in practice denies promotion to qualified females.

The term was later used in March 1984 by Gay Bryant, who is credited with popularizing the glass ceiling concept. She was the former editor of &quot;Working Woman&quot; magazine and was changing jobs to be the editor of &quot;Family Circle.&quot; In an &quot;Adweek&quot; article written by Nora Frenkel, Bryant was reported as saying, &quot;Women have reached a certain point—I call it the glass ceiling. They&#x27;re at the top of middle management and they&#x27;re stopping and getting stuck. There isn&#x27;t enough room for all those women at the top. Some are going into business for themselves. Others are going out and raising families.&quot; Also in 1984, Bryant used the term in a chapter of the book &quot;The Working Woman Report: Succeeding in Business in the 1980s.&quot; In the same book, Basia Hellwig used the term in another chapter.

In a widely cited article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in March 1986 the term was used in the article&#x27;s title: &quot;The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can&#x27;t Seem to Break The Invisible Barrier That Blocks Them From the Top Jobs&quot;. The article was written by Carol Hymowitz and Timothy D. Schellhardt. Hymowitz and Schellhardt introduced glass ceiling was &quot;not something that could be found in any corporate manual or even discussed at a business meeting; it was originally introduced as an invisible, covert, and unspoken phenomenon that existed to keep executive level leadership positions in the hands of Caucasian males.&quot;

As the term &quot;glass ceiling&quot; became more common, the public responded with differing ideas and opinions. Some argued that the concept is a myth because women choose to stay home and showed less dedication to advance into executive positions. As a result of continuing public debate, the US Labor Department&#x27;s chief, Lynn Morley Martin, reported the results of a research project called &quot;The Glass Ceiling Initiative&quot;, formed to investigate the low numbers of women and minorities in executive positions. This report defined the new term as &quot;those artificial barriers based on attitudinal or organizational bias that prevent qualified individuals from advancing upward in their organization into management-level positions.&quot;

In 1991, as a part of Title II of the Civil Right Act of 1991, The United States Congress created the Glass Ceiling Commission. This 21 member Presidential Commission was chaired by Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, and was created to study the &quot;barriers to the advancement of minorities and women within corporate hierarchies[,] to issue a report on its findings and conclusions, and to make recommendations on ways to dis- mantle the glass ceiling.&quot; The commission conducted extensive research including, surveys, public hearings and interviews, and released their findings in a report in 1995. The report, &quot;Good for Business&quot;, offered &quot;tangible guidelines and solutions on how these barriers can be overcome and eliminated&quot;. The goal of the commission was to provide recommendations on how to &quot;shatter&quot; the glass ceiling, specifically in the world of business. The report issued 12 recommendations on how to improve the workplace by increasing diversity in organizations and reducing discrimination through policy.

The number of women CEOs in the Fortune Lists has increased between 1998 and 2020, despite women&#x27;s labor force participation rate decreasing globally from 52.4% to 49.6% between 1995 and 2015. Only 19.2% of S&amp;P 500 Board Seats were held by women in 2014, 80.2% of whom were considered white.

== Glass Ceiling Index ==

In 2017, &quot;The Economist&quot; updated their Glass Ceiling Index, combining data on higher education, labour-force participation, pay, child-care costs, maternity and paternity rights, business-school applications, and representation in senior jobs. The countries where inequality was the lowest were Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Poland.

== Gender stereotypes ==
In a 1993 report released through the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, researchers noted that although women have the same educational opportunities as their male counterparts, the Glass Ceiling persist due to systematic barriers, low representation, mobility, and stereotypes. The perpetuation of sexist stereotypes is one widely recognized reason as to why female employees are systematically inhibited from receiving advantageous opportunities in their chosen fields. A majority of Americans perceive women to be more emotional and men to be more aggressive. Gender stereotypes influence how leaders are chosen by employers and how workers of different sex are treated. Another stereotype towards women in workplaces is known as the &quot;gender status belief&quot; which claims that men are more competent and intelligent than women, which would explain why they have higher positions in the career hierarchy. Ultimately, this factor leads to perception of gender-based jobs in the labor market, so men are expected to have more work-related qualifications and hired for top positions. Perceived feminine stereotypes contribute to the glass ceiling faced by women in the workforce.

Gender stereotyping is thinking that men are better than women in management and leadership roles; it is the concept of alluding that women are inferior and better suited in their biological roles of mother and spouse. The nature of this stereotype is toxic and hindering to women&#x27;s success and their rights in every aspect but it is even more damaging in the workplace in a patriarchal society. It represents an invisible but strong barrier that stands in the way of women. Men are put at the utmost positions for they are primally viewed as better leaders whereas women are stuck in low or medium level positions. These barriers to women&#x27;s progression in management roles and a of significant issue. For example, the few women that have worked hard and relentlessly to break those barriers and have earned their deserving place in a leadership role are either viewed as &quot;competent or warm&quot; but never both. This is because the idea of a successful woman is stereotyped within the idea that she must be a ruthless, competitive, cold person whereas a woman of a warm and caring nature will be perceived as not having the right skill set for leadership and progression because &quot;she does not have what it takes&quot;.

== Hiring practices ==
When women leave their current place of employment to start their own businesses, they tend to hire other women, and men to hire other men. These hiring practices (seemingly) diminish &quot;the glass ceiling&quot; effect because there is a perception of less competition of capabilities and sex discrimination. They appear to ally with the idea of &quot;men&#x27;s work&quot; and &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot;.

== Cross-cultural context ==
Few women tend to reach positions in the upper echelon of society, and organizations are largely still almost exclusively led by men. Studies have shown that the glass ceiling still exists in varying levels in different nations and regions across the world. The stereotypes of women as emotional and sensitive could be seen as key characteristics as to why women struggle to break the glass ceiling. It is clear that even though societies differ from one another by culture, beliefs, and norms, they hold similar expectations of women and their role in society. These female stereotypes are often reinforced in societies that have traditional expectations of women. The stereotypes and perceptions of women are changing slowly across the world, which also reduces gender segregation in organizations.

== Overcoming glass ceiling ==
Despite significant improvement of women&#x27;s participation in the labor force due to equity programs, advanced education levels, and work-life balanced policies, women are still underrepresented in upper-level positions in the workplace. There has been substantial invisible barriers for them to reach high-level management position such as lack of social capital, low level of self-efficacy and self-esteem, gender stereotypes, and masculine organizational culture. In fact, individual, government and organization effort are needed to break double glass ceilings in which not only cultural and gender biases but also limitation of access to resources and opportunities have been rooted in the male-dominated workplace.

===&quot;Individual effort&quot;===
One of the effective strategies that women can use to overcome the glass ceiling effect on their own is networking. Social networks are critical for promoting one&#x27;s career and receiving access to resources. Establishing intensive connections within and outside an organization can contribute to better interpersonal understanding and reduction of negative stereotypical views of women and thus achieving career advancement in return. Social networks can be constructed through connections with individuals on various dimensions such as formal vs. informal, homogeneity vs. heterogeneity, instrumental vs. psychosocial and strong vs. weak ties. Women have strong capabilities of building and maintaining social relationship. They can create internal network within their organizations that influence on deciding promotion and acceptance while an external network with outsiders contributes to psychosocial support. They can build social networks in different ways depending on their social identity and cultural background. However, building and maintaining networks can be time-consuming and not straightforward. Women can also face additional barriers to construct networks in an organization that have been dominated by powerful men.

The benefits accumulated from social networks become social capital for individuals. Thus, the quality of one&#x27;s social network can determine the value of its social capital. Social capital can contribute several positive career outcomes such as task accomplishment and social support for career advancement. Women can enhance their social capital and promote their professional images through mentoring. Mentoring plays a critical role in supporting women to achieve executive-level positions in an organization. Mentoring means a senior with advanced knowledge, skills and experience helps a junior through career and psychological support. Career support includes sponsorship, coaching and visibility while psychological support includes acceptance, emotional support and role modeling. A supportive supervisor or mentor can enhance the opportunity of being appointed to the critical roles and increase the probability of actual promotions through temporary promotions. To achieve this, women can intentionally forge relationships across race, gender, occupation level and organizational culture. Moreover, they can borrow this kind of social capital from strategic partners to get important contacts. But, such kind of connection is related with only temporary promotions. Mentors are more likely to support the same-gender mentee in an organization. Female mentors may be sympathetic and understand about women&#x27;s challenges and emotions in the battle of promotions. However, this benefit could be realized only when female mentors reach relatively high-level positions. In fact, it is difficult for women to receive mentoring from the same gender since there are fewer senior management positions occupied by women.

Positive attitude towards glass ceiling can also help women to break glass ceiling. Optimistic beliefs about chances of being promoted in an organization can cause positive actions towards pursuing promotions. Resilience and denial are optimistic glass ceiling beliefs for subjective career success. Resilience means women believe that they are able to break glass ceiling: they can fight for their rights to promotion and career development. Denial means women think that men and women experience the same issues and barriers in pursuing executive positions. On the other hand, resignation and acceptance are pessimistic glass ceiling beliefs for subjective career advancement. Resignation means women are unwilling to break glass ceiling due to the belief of experiencing more negative consequences than men. Acceptance deals with women&#x27;s preference on other goals such as family involvement instead of career advancement. Women who want to reach higher levels of management in an organization can analyze their levels of resilience and denial. Then, they will be able to build resilience skill through attitude, behavior and social support in order to overcome glass ceiling in a highly competitive contemporary workplace.

===&quot;Organization effort&quot;===
Overcoming the glass ceiling is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic advantage for organizations aiming to thrive in an increasingly diverse in a complex world. To break through this barrier and promote diversity and inclusivity in leadership, organizations must adopt a multifaceted and sustained approaches including development of policies, programs, leadership commitment and evaluation.

1. Policies

Effective diversity and inclusion policies play a pivotal role in breaking through organizational glass ceilings. Firstly, organizations must develop robust recruitment and retention strategies that not only attract diverse talent but also address attrition rates among underrepresented employees through targeted retention programs. To foster diversity at all levels, from recruitment to promotions, organizations should establish clear and comprehensive diversity and inclusion policies. These policies should not only outline specific objectives but also incorporate metrics and strategies that serve as guiding principles. Furthermore, compliance with all relevant anti-discrimination and equal opportunity laws is fundamental in cultivating a fair and inclusive workplace. Moreover, transparency in promotion and succession processes is essential. Maintaining clear communication regarding the criteria for advancement empowers employees to understand and actively pursue leadership opportunities, thereby dismantling the glass ceiling and promoting a more inclusive and equitable workplace. In addition to focusing on policy, organizations should also prioritize their programs for breaking through the glass ceiling.

2. Program

Firstly, organizations should prioritize the creation of comprehensive diversity and inclusion programs that clearly show their dedication to fairness and equal opportunities to all employees in workplaces. In addition, ensuring fairness in promotions is vital. Transparent promotion criteria must be developed and consistently applied across the organization to maintain fairness and equal opportunities for all. Furthermore, the implementation of leadership development programs is essential to identify and nurture potential leaders from diverse backgrounds. These programs may include elements such as mentorship, training, and opportunities for high-potential employees to gain valuable leadership experience.

To increase awareness and mitigate unconscious bias, organizations should provide diversity and inclusion training for all employees, including management and executives. This training should equip individuals with strategies to minimize the impact of bias on decision-making and team dynamics. Lastly, organizations should create platforms and events that facilitate networking opportunities for employees from diverse backgrounds to interact with senior leadership. Enhanced visibility through these initiatives is paramount for career progression and reinforces an organization&#x27;s commitment to breaking through the glass ceiling and promoting diversity and inclusion.

3. Leadership commitment

Firstly, leaders must exemplify unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion, serving as champions of this vital initiative. This should be evident in the organization&#x27;s values, policies, and in the actions of its leaders. Secondly, organizations should establish clear accountability mechanisms. Leadership should be held responsible for achieving diversity and inclusion goals, with performance metrics directly tied to these objectives. Additionally, promoting inclusive leadership is crucial. Organizations should invest in training their leaders to make equitable and inclusive decisions, manage teams with fairness, and engage in inclusive interactions. Effective communication plays a pivotal role in this journey. Organizations should transparently communicate their commitment to diversity and inclusion, both internally and externally. Regularly publishing diversity and inclusion reports helps maintain transparency and keeps stakeholders informed about progress. Lastly, cultural transformation is essential. Cultivating a workplace culture rooted in respect and open communication is paramount (Bhasin, 2020). Encouraging employees to report any instances of discrimination or harassment and providing a safe and supportive space for such reports is vital to addressing issues promptly and effectively.

4. Performance evaluation

To successfully overcome the glass ceiling at the organizational level, a commitment to continuous improvement is paramount. This entails regularly evaluating the effectiveness of diversity and inclusion initiatives through methods such as surveys, feedback mechanisms, and data analysis. Organizations must remain adaptable, ready to adjust their strategies as necessary to tackle evolving challenges and capitalize on opportunities for enhancement.

===&quot;Glass escalator&quot;===

A parallel phenomenon called the &quot;glass escalator&quot; has also been recognized. As more men join fields that were previously dominated by women, such as nursing and teaching, the men are promoted and given more opportunities compared to the women, as if the men were taking escalators and the women were taking the stairs. The chart from Carolyn K. Broner shows an example of the glass escalator in favor of men for female-dominant occupations in schools. While women have historically dominated the teaching profession, men tend to take higher positions in school systems such as deans or principals.

Men benefit financially from their gender status in historically female fields, often &quot;reaping the benefits of their token status to reach higher levels in female-dominated work&quot;.

A 2008 study published in &quot;Social Problems&quot; found that sex segregation in nursing did not follow the &quot;glass escalator&quot; pattern of disproportional vertical distribution; rather, men and women gravitated towards different areas within the field, with male nurses tending to specialize in areas of work perceived as &quot;masculine&quot;. The article noted that &quot;men encounter powerful social pressures that direct them away from entering female-dominated occupations (Jacobs 1989, 1993)&quot;. Since female-dominated occupations are usually characterized by more feminine activities, men who enter these jobs can be perceived socially as &quot;effeminate, homosexual, or sexual predators&quot;.

===&quot;Sticky floors&quot;===
In the literature on gender discrimination, the concept of &quot;sticky floors&quot; complements the concept of a glass ceiling. Sticky floors can be described as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. This is often due to discriminatory employment pattern that keeps workers, mainly women, in the lower ranks of the job scale, with low mobility and invisible barriers to career advancement. Thereby, this phenomenon is related to gender differentials at the bottom of the wage distribution. Building on the seminal study by Booth and co-authors in European Economic Review, during the last decade economists have attempted to identify sticky floors in the labour market. They found empirical evidence for the existence of sticky floors in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Italy, Thailand, and the United States.

===&quot;The frozen middle&quot;===
Similar to the sticky floor, the frozen middle describes the phenomenon of women&#x27;s progress up the corporate ladder slowing, if not halting, in the ranks of middle management. Originally the term referred to the resistance corporate upper management faced from middle management when issuing directives. Due to a lack of ability or lack of drive in the ranks of middle management, these directives do not come into fruition and as a result the company&#x27;s bottom line suffers. The term was popularized by a &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; article titled &quot;Middle Management Excellence&quot;. Due to the growing proportion of women to men in the workforce, however, the term &quot;frozen middle&quot; has become more commonly ascribed to the aforementioned slowing of the careers of women in middle management. The 1996 study &quot;A Study of the Career Development and Aspirations of Women in Middle Management&quot; posits that social structures and networks within businesses that favor &quot;good old boys&quot; and norms of masculinity exist based on the experiences of women surveyed. According to the study, women who did not exhibit stereotypical masculine traits, (e.g. aggressiveness, thick skin, lack of emotional expression) and interpersonal communication tendencies were disadvantaged compared to their male peers. As the ratio of men to women increases in the upper levels of management, women&#x27;s access to female mentors who could advise them on ways to navigate office politics is limited, further inhibiting upward mobility within a corporation or firm. Furthermore, the frozen middle affects female professionals in western and eastern countries such as the United States and Malaysia, respectively, as well as women in a variety of fields ranging from the aforementioned corporations to STEM fields.

===&quot;Second shift&quot;===
The second shift focuses on the idea that women theoretically work a second shift in the manner of having a greater workload, not just doing a greater share of domestic work. All of the tasks that are engaged in outside the workplace are mainly tied to motherhood. Depending on location, household income, educational attainment, ethnicity and location, data shows that women do work a second shift in the sense of having a greater workload, not just doing a greater share of domestic work, but this is not apparent if simultaneous activity is overlooked. Alva Myrdal and Viola Klein as early as 1956 focused on the potential of both men and women working in settings that included paid and unpaid types of work environments. Research indicated that men and women could have equal time for activities outside the work environment for family and extra activities. This &quot;second shift&quot; has also been found to have physical effects as well. Women who engage in longer hours of work in pursuit of family balance often face increased mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. Increased irritability, lower motivation and energy, and other emotional issues were also found to occur as well. The overall happiness of women can be improved if a balance of career and home responsibilities is found.

===&quot;Mommy track&quot;===
&quot;Mommy track&quot; refers to women who disregard their careers and professional responsibilities in order to satisfy the needs of their families. Women are often subject to long work hours that create an imbalance within the work-family schedule. There is research suggesting that women are able to operate on a part-time professional schedule compared to others who worked full-time while still engaged in external family activities. This research also suggests that flexible work arrangements allow the achievement of a healthy work and family balance. A difference has also been discovered in the cost and amount of effort in childbearing between women in higher skilled positions and roles, as opposed to women in lower-skilled jobs. This difference leads women to delay and postpone goals and career aspirations over many years.

===&quot;Concrete floor&quot;===
The term &quot;concrete floor&quot; has been used to refer to the minimum number or the proportion of women necessary for a cabinet or board of directors to be perceived as legitimate.

==Quota Doctors==
Government intervention in the admission and promotion process results in beneficiaries being tagged as quota doctors. These quotas are floor quotas, having a required minimum; their contrast is for ceiling quotas, Numerus clausus.

<text>The Rose Revolution or Revolution of Roses () was a nonviolent change of power that occurred in Georgia in November 2003. The event was brought about by widespread protests over the disputed parliamentary elections and culminated in the resignation of President Eduard Shevardnadze, which marked the end of Soviet-era leadership in the country. The revolution derives its name from the climactic moment, when demonstrators led by Mikheil Saakashvili stormed the Parliament session with red roses in hand.

The revolution was led by Shevardnadze&#x27;s former political allies, Mikheil Saakashvili, Nino Burjanadze and Zurab Zhvania. Consisting of twenty days of protests from 3 to 23 November 2003, the Revolution triggered new presidential and parliamentary elections in Georgia, which brought the National Movement–Democrats coalition to the power. The death of Zurab Zhvania in uncertain circumstances and the withdrawal of Nino Burjanadze into opposition eventually established the United National Movement as the single ruling party. The next change of power in Georgia was brought by the 2012 Georgian parliamentary election.

The Rose Revolution is considered one of the early examples of colour revolutions. It was marked by strong role of non-governmental organizations and student activism. The role of the United States, as in other colour revolutions, has been a subject of significant controversy.

==Precipitating factors==

=== Fragmentation of the political elite ===
The Citizens&#x27; Union of Georgia (CUG) had been the ruling party for most of Eduard Shevardnadze&#x27;s Presidency, and represented the interests of Shevardnadze loyalists. The ineffectiveness of the government and the decreasing popularity of the regime led to the defection of numerous parliamentary deputies from the ruling party in 2000. The first group to leave the CUG represented the business community and would go on to form the New Rights Party (NRP) in 2001. This began the collapse of the party, as numerous party officials and deputies defected to join or form other parties. Eduard Shevardnadze himself resigned from the chairmanship of the CUG in September 2001. Fatefully, Mikheil Saakashvili (the Minister of Justice) left the ruling party in September and would form the National Movement opposition party one month later. The defections continued for the next two years, and left the Citizens&#x27; Union of Georgia as a far weaker party with support clustered in a few regions, and a leadership notorious for accumulating wealth illegally through their positions in government. The disintegration of the party highlighted the weakness of the Shevardnadze regime and dispersed the political elite amongst a number of new parties and independent platforms.

The collapse of the Citizens&#x27; Union of Georgia and more apparent public discontent with Shevardnadze allowed for the formation of numerous new parties after 2000. The ruling party showed its vulnerability in the 2002 local elections, losing decisively to independents and new parties. The local elections saw independents secure 2754 seats, with the New Rights Party (NRP) being the most successful political party, obtaining 558 parliamentary seats. The Citizens&#x27; Union of Georgia won only 70 out of approximately 4,850 local parliamentary seats.

Following the disastrous 2002 local elections, Shevardnadze made a concerted attempt to rebuild a political coalition that could support him. The CUG was rebuilt before the 2003 parliamentary election, which was understood to be a key trial before the 2005 presidential election. However, President Shevardnadze&#x27;s popularity rating had plummeted to around 5%, undermining any attempt to revive the CUG under his leadership. The new CUG further found itself divided over internal disputes, and lacking effective leadership to replace those that had defected.

===Rise of non-governmental organizations===
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) played a significant role in the Rose Revolution. By the end of 2000, the number of NGOs estimated to be in Georgia numbered around four thousand. The 1997 Civil Code made the registration of an NGO relatively easy, and they operated in Georgia with few restrictions. Though only a small portion of those likely had influence on the government or were successful in lobbying, several had leverage in parliament. While public participation in these NGOs was relatively low, they were ultimately successful in mobilizing the population to play a more active role in government. Two of the most important were the Georgian Young Lawyers Association and the Liberty Institute, both of which were active in the promotion of human rights and freedom of information legislation before the Rose Revolution.

Shevardnadze had allowed the development of NGOs before the Rose Revolution, and numerous large and relatively uninhibited NGOs were able to operate in Georgia prior to the 2003 parliamentary elections. Georgia&#x27;s weak economy allowed these NGOs, who were often partially foreign funded, to pay decent salaries that would not have been available in working for the Georgian state. As early as the Summer of 2002, there was great concern amongst the leaders of Georgia&#x27;s most influential NGOs that Shevardnadze was not prepared to relinquish power voluntarily, and that other ways to remove him from power might be necessary. Some of these leaders hoped to make the &#x27;Serbian scenario&#x27; a reality in Georgia, in the sense that they wanted to promote non-violent protests to force the resignation of an authoritarian leader. Before the Rose Revolution, a large network of NGOs with foreign financial support already existed in the country that could later coordinate protest.

===Foreign support===
Foreign support for the Shevardnadze regime declined from 2000 to 2003, with notable figures outwardly calling for a more democratic transition. These included Richard Miles (the US ambassador to Georgia), and allies of the Bush administration, including a visit from James Baker (the former U.S. Secretary of State) who pressured Shevardnadze to accept parallel vote tabulation and pushed for free election standards.

In the three years before the Rose Revolution, foreign financial support for the regime began to become severely limited. Instead, foreign states and organizations gave financial assistance to NGOs and opposition parties within Georgia, worsening the desperate budget situation of the Shevardnadze government. The United States announced a reduction in aid, coinciding with a decision by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to suspend aid to Georgia. As international support for the regime deteriorated (particularly in the West), public perceptions of Shevardnadze&#x27;s political weakness increased. A significant source of funding for NGOs and election monitoring organizations came from foreign governments and individuals. The U.S. and European governments gave the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) the funds to support foreign election observers. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)§ spent $1.5 million to computerize Georgia&#x27;s voter rolls. The Open Society Institute (OSI), funded by George Soros, supported Mikheil Saakashvili and a network of pro-democratic organizations. Western democracy promoters also circulated public opinion polls and scrutinized election data throughout Georgia.

===Role of the media===
An important factor in the Rose Revolution was the independent television channel Rustavi-2, which served as an ally for the opposition movement for years. It was highly critical of the regime, and openly supported the opposition. Georgia&#x27;s broad Freedom of Information law gave media outlets the legal protection to criticize the government, making it a leader amongst the former Eastern Bloc. Nonetheless, the government tried repeatedly to shut Rustavi-2 down. The station operated out of Tbilisi and managed to survive the regime&#x27;s harassment and intimidation techniques. Rustavi-2 was partially financially supported, trained, and sometimes protected by USAID and the Eurasia Foundation, which often mobilized public and international support to prevent government interference in the station&#x27;s reporting. The broadcasts of Rustavi-2 ended up being instrumental in building the opposition and encouraging protest.

Two events in 2001 caused an outcry of public opinion against the government. In July, a popular anchor for the Rustavi-2 network, Giorgi Sanaia, was murdered. The consensus among Georgian journalists and the public was that he was killed because of his anti-government work on the Chechen conflict and corruption investigations. In October, agents from the National Security Ministry raided the headquarters of Rustavi-2. The tax-raid was broadcast on television from outside the building. Upwards of seven thousand student-led protestors, many mobilized by the Liberty Institute NGO, amassed outside the headquarters and demanded the resignation of the Shevardnadze government. Shevardnadze responded by sacking his cabinet and his minister of security. Importantly, this event triggered the defection of Mikheil Saakashvili and the abdication of Zurab Zhvania from their positions in the Citizens&#x27; Union of Georgia, eventually leading to the formation of the National Movement and United Democrats opposition parties.

While still the target of government harassment, Rustavi-2 continued to air anti-Shevardnadze material until 2003. This included the repeated airing of Bringing Down a Dictator, a film portraying the fall of Slobodan Milošević in the nonviolent Serbian revolution. Other networks, such as Imedi television and Mze began to report on the political process more objectively, possibly influenced by Rustavi-2&#x27;s defiance. Rustavi-2 would eventually be the network to commission and broadcast the exit poll results of the 2003 parliamentary election, which found Saakashvili&#x27;s National Movement party victorious over the pro-Shevardnadze bloc.

===Economic factors===
The susceptibility of Shevardnadze&#x27;s government and his plummeting popularity between 2000 and 2003 can partially be traced to economic problems and mismanagement. Beginning in 1998, actual national budget revenues began to fall far short of projections. In 1999, the Georgian state collected only 70% of its projected revenue, a state of affairs that would continue through 2003. To address this problem, the government began to use deceptive accounting techniques to mask budget deficiencies. Shevardnadze&#x27;s government found itself both starved of funds and unable to meet IMF standards for international loans. The IMF finally suspended its own funding for Georgia in 2002. Without access to international loans, Georgia would not be able to restructure or repay its significant debts.

In the period before 2003, the growth rate of the Georgian economy fell. The 1998 economic crisis in Russia, Georgia&#x27;s main energy provider and trade partner, put an end to Georgia&#x27;s modest recovery. While there was some economic growth in 2003, a budgetary crisis weakened the state. The Georgian government&#x27;s meager program of public goods and basic services had been chronically underfunded for years. By the end of 2003, debt in the form of unpaid salaries and pensions reached $120 million. Deterioration of public infrastructure was also poorly addressed by Shevardnadze&#x27;s government. Georgian businesses lost an average of 110 business days per year because of failures in infrastructure (usually in the energy sector). The state was unable to repair the crumbling infrastructure or consistently enforce the law. Social conditions also further deteriorated, with over half of the population finding itself under the poverty line, creating even greater dissatisfaction with the Shevardnadze administration.

Corruption among state officials and police, while not new, was certainly exacerbated by Georgia&#x27;s lack of budget revenue. The official salary of a Georgian state minister was around 150 Lari in 1998 (approximately US$75). Low pay forced many state employees to turn to alternative sources of income, often involving corrupt activities. President Shevardnadze came to be seen as a man who was unwilling to break the Soviet patterns of personal power, political corruption, and authoritarian rule embedded in traditional Soviet cadre politics. Corruption had become so rampant, that off-the-record deals may have accounted for 60-70% of Georgia&#x27;s total economic activity. The Shevardnadze regime was not seen as being capable of addressing corruption. Opposition candidates, such as Saakashvili, could successfully gain much support with an anti-corruption political platform.

==Elections and protests==

Georgia held parliamentary elections on November 2, 2003. At stake were 235 seats in parliament of which 135 would be decided by a nationwide proportional party-list system and 85 were &quot;majoritarian&quot; contests in which a winner would be determined in each of Georgia&#x27;s 85 electoral districts. In addition, a nationwide referendum was held on whether the future parliament should be reduced to 150 members. Voters used a separate ballot for each of these three contests, folding them together and placing them in a single envelope which was then put in the ballot box. This was not a presidential election; that was set to occur in the spring of 2005, at the expiration of President Shevardnadze&#x27;s second and final term.

In July 2003, U.S. president George W. Bush sent former secretary of state James Baker to meet with both opposition leaders and President Shevardnadze. To the latter, Baker delivered a letter from Bush sternly stressing the need for free elections. Baker proposed a formula for representation of the various parties on the electoral commissions at each level. Shevardnadze agreed, but immediately began maneuvering against the Baker formula.

On 3 November the International Election Observation Mission, composed of the Parliamentary Assemblies of the OSCE and the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and the OSCE&#x27;s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), concluded that the 2 November parliamentary elections in Georgia fell short of a number of OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections. Mikheil Saakashvili claimed that he had won the elections (a claim supported by independent exit polls). This was confirmed by an independent parallel vote tabulation (PVT) conducted by the ISFED (International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy, a local election monitoring group). Saakashvilli and the United Opposition accepted ISFED&#x27;s PVT as &quot;official&quot; results, and urged Georgians to demonstrate against Shevardnadze&#x27;s government and engage in nonviolent civil disobedience against the authorities. The main democratic opposition parties united to demand the ousting of Shevardnadze and the rerun of the elections.

In mid-November, massive antigovernmental demonstrations started in the central streets of Tbilisi, soon involving almost all major cities and towns of Georgia in a concerted campaign of civil resistance. The &quot;Kmara&quot; (&quot;Enough!&quot;) youth organization (a Georgian counterpart of the Serbian &quot;Otpor!&quot;) and several NGOs, like the Liberty Institute, were active in all protest activities. Shevardnadze&#x27;s government was backed by Aslan Abashidze, the semi-separatist leader of the autonomous Adjara region, who sent thousands of his supporters to hold a pro-governmental counter-demonstration in Tbilisi.

==Change of power==
The opposition protest reached its peak on November 22, when President Shevardnadze attempted to open the new session of parliament. This session was considered illegitimate by two of the four major opposition parties. Supporters of two of those parties, led by Saakashvili, burst into the session with roses in their hands (hence the name Rose Revolution), interrupting a speech of President Eduard Shevardnadze and forcing him to escape with his bodyguards. He later declared a state of emergency and began to mobilize troops and police near his residence in Tbilisi. However, the elite military units refused to support the government. In the evening of November 23 (St George&#x27;s Day in Georgia), Shevardnadze met with the opposition leaders Saakashvili and Zurab Zhvania to discuss the situation, in a meeting arranged by Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. After the meeting, the president announced his resignation. That prompted euphoria in the streets of Tbilisi. More than 50,000 protesters celebrated the victory all night long, accompanied by fireworks and rock concerts.
 Following the resignation of Eduard Shevardnadze, new elections were planned to bring power to a new leader. The outgoing speaker of parliament, Nino Burjanadze, assumed the presidency until new elections could be held. The Supreme Court of Georgia annulled the results of the parliamentary elections. New elections happened six weeks later on January 4, 2004. Unopposed and with 96.2 percent of the vote, Saakashvili became the new president of Georgia and was inaugurated on January 25. He became the youngest European president at the age of 36. On March 28, 2004, new parliamentary elections were held, with a large majority won by the Saakashvili-supporting National Movement - Democrats, and a minority representation of the Rightist Opposition.

After being elected, Saakashvili wasted no time in passing a series of legislation and reforms. Criticized as being very &quot;pro-western,&quot; his agenda was able to improve the country&#x27;s economy and launch a new anti-corruption campaign. He was able to bring the country&#x27;s rating according to the World Bank from 122nd to 18th in the world by expanding the banking sector by 40 percent, increasing foreign investment to $3 billion, and maintaining an annual growth of 9.5%. 

===International involvement===
Many countries watched Georgia transition from an autocracy to a democracy, but the key players were primarily Russia and the United States. Russia was suspected of being involved in Georgia&#x27;s affairs from the beginning as it was assumed to have been involved in various coup and assassination attempts of Shevardnadze. Georgia, a state that was previously under Soviet influence, took independence in the 1990s, but saw much disarray in the form of separatist
Groups, particularly those that were Russian-backed. The United States felt the revolution was a good opportunity to make a serious attempt in the establishment of democracy not only in Georgia, but the region it was in. The U.S. Agency for International Development was reported to have spent $1.5 million on modernizing Georgia&#x27;s voting system. They also invested in 3,000 election observers throughout the country.

A significant source of funding for the Rose Revolution was the network of foundations and NGOs associated with Hungarian-American billionaire financier George Soros. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies reports the case of a former Georgian parliamentarian who alleges that in the three months prior to the Rose Revolution, &quot;Soros spent $42 million ramping-up for the overthrow of Shevardnadze.

Among the personalities who worked for Soros&#x27; organizations who later assumed positions in the Georgian government are:
*Alexander Lomaia, Secretary of the Georgian Security Council and former Minister of Education and Science, a former Executive Director of the Open Society Georgia Foundation (Soros Foundation), overseeing a staff of 50 and a budget of $2,500,000.
*David Darchiashvili, the chairman of the Committee for Eurointegration in the Georgian parliament, is also a former Executive Director of the Open Society Georgia Foundation.

Former Georgian Foreign Minister Salomé Zourabichvili wrote:

The amount of international involvement created a variety of conspiracy theories. The most popular implies that the United States was responsible for the overthrow of Shevardnadze. Many non-governmental organizations from the U.S. were in Georgia actively educating the people on human rights and the ideals of democracy. Also, the U.S. Ambassador in Georgia at the time, Richard Miles, was also the U.S. Ambassador in Belgrade from 1996 to 1999.

==Adjara==

In May 2004, the so-called &quot;Second Rose Revolution&quot; took place in Batumi, Adjara. After months of extreme tension between Saakashvili&#x27;s government and Aslan Abashidze, the virtual dictator of the autonomous region, thousands of Adjarans, mobilized by the United National Movement and Kmara, protested against Abashidze&#x27;s policy of separatism and militarization. Abashidze used security forces and paramilitary groups to break up the demonstrations in the streets of Batumi and Kobuleti. However, he failed to suppress the protests, and they grew in size and scope. On May 6, 2004 (again St George&#x27;s Day), protesters from all Ajara gathered in Batumi despite being dispersed by force the day before. Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania and Interior Minister Giorgi Baramidze negotiated with Adjaran Interior Minister Jemal Gogitidze to withdraw his forces from the administrative border at the Choloki River and led Georgian Special Forces into the region. Abashidze bowed to the inevitable, resigned in the same evening and left for Moscow. President Saakashvili visited Batumi the next day and was met by celebrating Adjarans.

==International effects==
The Orange Revolution, which followed the disputed November 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, is said to have been partly inspired by the Georgian Rose Revolution.

<text>George Robert Stibitz (April 30, 1904 – January 31, 1995) was an American researcher at Bell Labs who is internationally recognized as one of the fathers of the modern digital computer. He was known for his work in the 1930s and 1940s on the realization of Boolean logic digital circuits using electromechanical relays as the switching element.

==Early life and education==
Stibitz was born in York, Pennsylvania, the son of Mildred Murphy, a math teacher, and George Stibitz, a German Reformed minister and theology professor. Throughout his childhood, Stibitz enjoyed assembling devices and systems, working with material as diverse as a toy Meccano set or the electrical wiring of the family home. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from Denison University in Granville, Ohio, a master&#x27;s degree in physics from Union College in 1927, and a Ph.D. in mathematical physics from Cornell University in 1930 with a thesis entitled &quot;Vibrations of a Non-Planar Membrane.&quot;

==Computer==
Stibitz began working at Bell Labs after his doctorate, where he would remain until 1941. In November 1937 he completed a relay-based adder he later dubbed the &quot;Model K&quot; (after his kitchen table, on which it was purportedly assembled), which calculated using binary addition. Replicas of the &quot;Model K&quot; now reside in the Computer History Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, the William Howard Doane Library at Denison University and the American Computer &amp; Robotics Museum in Bozeman, Montana.

Bell Labs subsequently authorized a full research program in late 1938 with Stibitz at the helm. He led the development of the Complex Number Calculator (CNC), completed in November 1939 and put into operation in 1940. Employing electromagnetic relay binary circuits for its operations, rather than counting wheels or gears, the machine executed calculations on complex numbers. In a demonstration at the meetings of the American Mathematical Society and Mathematical Association of America at Dartmouth College in September 1940, Stibitz used a modified teletype to send commands over telegraph lines to the CNC in New York . This was the first real-time, remote use of a computing machine.

==Wartime activities and subsequent Bell Labs computers==
After the United States entered World War II in December 1941, Bell Labs became active in developing fire-control devices for the U.S. military. The Labs&#x27; most famous invention was the M-9 Gun Director, an ingenious analog device that directed anti-aircraft fire with uncanny accuracy. Stibitz moved to the National Defense Research Committee, an advisory body for the government, but he kept close ties with Bell Labs. For the next several years (1941–1945), with his guidance, the Labs developed relay computers of ever-increasing sophistication. The first of them was used to test the M-9 Gun Director. Later models had more sophisticated capabilities. They had specialized names, but later on, Bell Labs renamed them &quot;Model II&quot;, &quot;Model III&quot;, etc., and the Complex Computer was renamed the &quot;Model I&quot;. All used telephone relays for logic, and paper tape for sequencing and control. The &quot;Model V&quot;, was completed in 1946 and was a fully programmable, general-purpose computer, although its relay technology made it slower than the all-electronic computers then under development.

At the end of the war, Stibitz did not return to Bell Labs, but went into private consulting work. From 1964 until his retirement in 1974, Stibitz was a research associate in physiology at the medical school of Dartmouth College.

==Use of the term &quot;digital&quot;==
In April 1942, Stibitz attended a meeting of a division of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), charged with evaluating various proposals for fire-control devices to be used against Axis forces during World War II. Stibitz noted that the proposals fell into two broad categories: &quot;analog&quot; and &quot;pulse&quot;. In a memo written after the meeting, he suggested that the term &quot;digital&quot; be used in place of &quot;pulse&quot;, as he felt the latter term was insufficiently descriptive of the nature of the processes involved. In the very same moment, he also pointed to the limits of this opposition between analog and digital. He presented it as a rather theoretical opposition with no practical use, as most computers of the time would consist of both analog and digital mechanisms.

==Awards==
* Harry H. Goode Memorial Award in 1965 (together with Konrad Zuse)
* IEEE&#x27;s Computer Pioneer Award, 1982
* election to the National Academy of Engineering, 1981
* election to the National Inventors Hall of Fame, 1985

Stibitz held 38 patents, in addition to those he earned at Bell Labs. He became a member of the faculty at Dartmouth College in 1964 to build bridges between the fields of computing and medicine, and retired from research in 1983.

==Computer art==
In his later years, Stibitz &quot;turned to non-verbal uses of the computer&quot;. Specifically, he used a Commodore-Amiga to create computer art. In a 1990 letter, written to the department chair of the Mathematics and Computer Science department of Denison University he said:

I have turned to non-verbal uses of the computer, and have made a display of computer &quot;art&quot;. The quotes are obligatory, for the result of my efforts is not to create important art but to show that this activity is fun, much as the creation of computers was fifty years ago.

The Mathematics and Computer Science department at Denison University has enlarged and displayed some of his artwork.

* Andrew Hodges (1983), &quot;Alan Turing: The Enigma&quot;, Simon and Schuster, New York, . Stibitz is mentioned briefly on pp. 299 &amp;326. Hodges refers to Stibitz&#x27;s machine as one of two &quot;big relay calculators&quot; (Howard H. Aiken&#x27;s being the other one, p. 326).
::&quot;The second American project [Aiken&#x27;s being the first] was underway at Bell Laboratories. Here the engineer G. Stibitz had first only thought of designing relay machines to perform decimal arithmetic with complex numbers, but after the outbreak of war had incorporated the facility to carry out a fixed sequence of arithmetical operations. His &#x27;Model III&#x27; [sic] was under way in the New York building at the time of Alan Turing&#x27;s stay there, but it had not drawn his attention.&quot; (p. 299)
: Stibitz&#x27;s work with binary addition has a peculiar (i.e. apparently simultaneous) overlap with some experimenting Alan Turing did in 1937 while a PhD student at Princeton. The following is according to a Dr. Malcolm McPhail &quot;who became involved in a sideline that Alan took up&quot; (p. 137); Turing built his own relays and &quot;actually designed an electric multiplier and built the first three or four stages to see if it could be made to work&quot; (p. 138). It is unknown whether Stibitz and/or McPhail had any influence on this work of Turing&#x27;s; McPhail&#x27;s implication is that Turing&#x27;s &quot;[alarm]about a possible war with Germany&quot; (p. 138) caused him to become interested in cryptanalysis, and this interest led to discussions with McPhail, and these discussions led to the relay-multiplier experiments (the pertinent part of McPhail&#x27;s letter to Hodges is quoted in Hodges p. 138).

<text>The World Starts With Me is a computer-based sex education and AIDS prevention program aimed at young Ugandans, developed and produced by the Butterfly Works Foundation and the World Population Foundation (a Dutch non-governmental organization) in association with Ugandan Schoolnet. It has so far reached children all around the globe and Kenyans have now joined in the learning process. Teenagers get to learn more about their bodies and sexually transmitted diseases. This helps in showing teenagers the consequences of having unprotected sex. In 2004, it won a Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica for Digital Communities.

<text>The Wars of the Diadochi (, &#x27;, &quot;War of the Crown Princes&quot;) orWars of Alexander&#x27;s Successors were a series of conflicts fought between the generals of Alexander the Great, known as the Diadochi, over who would rule his empire following his death. The fighting occurred between 322 and 281 BC.

==Background==
Alexander the Great died on June 10, 323 BC, leaving behind an empire that stretched from Macedon and the rest of Greece in Europe to the Indus valley in South Asia. The empire had no clear successor, with the Argead family, at this point, consisting of Alexander&#x27;s mentally disabled half-brother, Arrhidaeus; his unborn son Alexander IV; his reputed illegitimate son Heracles; his mother Olympias; his sister Cleopatra; and his half-sisters Thessalonike and Cynane.

Alexander&#x27;s death was the catalyst for the disagreements that ensued between his former generals resulting in a succession crisis. Two main factions formed after the death of Alexander. The first of these was led by Meleager, who supported the candidacy of Alexander&#x27;s half-brother, Arrhidaeus. The second was led by Perdiccas, the leading cavalry commander, who believed it would be best to wait until the birth of Alexander&#x27;s unborn child, by Roxana. Both parties agreed to a compromise, wherein Arrhidaeus would become king as Philip III and rule jointly with Roxana&#x27;s child, providing it was a male heir. Perdiccas was designated as regent of the empire, with Meleager acting as his lieutenant. However, soon after, Perdiccas had Meleager and the other leaders who had opposed him murdered, and he assumed full control.

The generals who had supported Perdiccas were rewarded in the partition of Babylon by becoming satraps of the various parts of the empire. Ptolemy received Egypt; Laomedon received Syria and Phoenicia; Philotas took Cilicia; Peithon took Media; Antigonus received Phrygia, Lycia and Pamphylia; Asander received Caria; Menander received Lydia; Lysimachus received Thrace; Leonnatus received Hellespontine Phrygia; and Neoptolemus had Armenia. Macedon and the rest of Greece were to be under the joint rule of Antipater, who had governed them for Alexander, and Craterus, a lieutenant of Alexander. Alexander&#x27;s secretary, Eumenes of Cardia, was to receive Cappadocia and Paphlagonia.

In the east, Perdiccas largely left Alexander&#x27;s arrangements intact – Taxiles and Porus ruled over their kingdoms in India; Alexander&#x27;s father-in-law Oxyartes ruled Gandara; Sibyrtius ruled Arachosia and Gedrosia; Stasanor ruled Aria and Drangiana; Philip ruled Bactria and Sogdiana; Phrataphernes ruled Parthia and Hyrcania; Peucestas governed Persis; Tlepolemus had charge over Carmania; Atropates governed northern Media; Archon got Babylonia; and, Arcesilas ruled northern Mesopotamia.

==Lamian War==

The news of Alexander&#x27;s death inspired a revolt in Greece, known as the Lamian War. Athens and other cities formed a coalition and besieged Antipater in the fortress of Lamia, however, Antipater was relieved by a force sent by Leonnatus, who was killed in battle. The Athenians were defeated at the Battle of Crannon on September 5, 322 BC, by Craterus and his fleet.

At this time, Peithon suppressed a revolt of Greek settlers in the eastern parts of the empire, and Perdiccas and Eumenes subdued Cappadocia.

==First War of the Diadochi, 321–319 BC==
Perdiccas, who was already betrothed to the daughter of Antipater, attempted to marry Alexander&#x27;s sister, Cleopatra, a marriage which would have given him claim to the Macedonian throne. In 322 BC, Antipater, Craterus and Antigonus all formed a coalition against Perdiccas&#x27;s growing power. Soon after, Antipater would send his army, under the command of Craterus, into Asia Minor. In late 322 or early 321 BC, Ptolemy stole Alexander&#x27;s body on its way to Macedonia and then joined the coalition. A force under Eumenes defeated Craterus at the battle of the Hellespont, however, Perdiccas was soon after murdered by his own generals Peithon, Seleucus, and Antigenes during his invasion of Egypt, after a failed attempt to cross the Nile.

Ptolemy came to terms with Perdiccas&#x27;s murderers, making Peithon and Arrhidaeus regents in Perdiccas&#x27;s place, but soon these came to a new agreement with Antipater at the Treaty of Triparadisus. Antipater was made Regent of the Empire, and the two kings were moved to Macedon. Antigonus was made Strategos of Asia and remained in charge of Phrygia, Lycia, and Pamphylia, to which was added Lycaonia. Ptolemy retained Egypt, Lysimachus retained Thrace, while the three murderers of Perdiccas—Seleucus, Peithon, and Antigenes—were given the provinces of Babylonia, Media, and Susiana respectively. Arrhidaeus, the former regent, received Hellespontine Phrygia. Antigonus was charged with the task of rooting out Perdiccas&#x27;s former supporter, Eumenes. In effect, Antipater retained for himself control of Europe, while Antigonus, as Strategos of the East, held a similar position in Asia.

Although the First War ended with the death of Perdiccas, his cause lived on. Eumenes was still at large with a victorious army in Asia Minor. So were Alcetas, Attalus, Dokimos and Polemon who had also gathered their armies in Asia Minor. In 319 BC, Antigonus, after receiving reinforcements from Antipater&#x27;s European army, first campaigned against Eumenes (see: battle of Orkynia), then against the combined forces of Alcetas, Attalus, Dokimos and Polemon (see: battle of Cretopolis), defeating them all.

==Second War of the Diadochi, 318–316 BC==

Another war soon broke out between the Diadochi. At the start of 318 BC Arrhidaios, the governor of Hellespontine Phrygia, tried to take the city of Cyzicus. Antigonus, as the Strategos of Asia, took this as a challenge to his authority and recalled his army from their winter quarters. He sent an army against Arrhidaios while he himself marched with the main army into Lydia against its governor Cleitus whom he drove out of his province.

Cleitus fled to Macedon and joined Polyperchon, the new Regent of the Empire, who decided to march his army south to force the Greek cities to side with him against Cassander and Antigonus. Cassander, reinforced with troops and a fleet by Antigonus, sailed to Athens and thwarted Polyperchon&#x27;s efforts to take the city. From Athens Polyperchon marched on Megalopolis which had sided with Cassander and besieged the city. The siege failed and he had to retreat losing a lot of prestige and most of the Greek cities. Eventually Polyperchon retreated to Epirus with the infant King Alexander IV. There he joined forces with Alexander&#x27;s mother Olympias and was able to re-invade Macedon. King Philip Arrhidaeus, Alexander&#x27;s half-brother, having defected to Cassander&#x27;s side at the prompting of his wife, Eurydice, was forced to flee, only to be captured in Amphipolis, resulting in the execution of himself and the forced suicide of his wife, both purportedly at the instigation of Olympias. Cassander rallied once more, and seized Macedon. Olympias was murdered, and Cassander gained control of the infant King and his mother. Eventually, Cassander became the dominant power in the European part of the Empire, ruling over Macedon and large parts of Greece.

Meanwhile, Eumenes, who had gathered a small army in Cappadocia, had entered the coalition of Polyperchon and Olympias. He took his army to the royal treasury at Kyinda in Cilicia where he used its funds to recruit mercenaries. He also secured the loyalty of 6,000 of Alexander&#x27;s veterans, the Argyraspides (the Silver Shields) and the Hypaspists, who were stationed in Cilicia. In the spring of 317 BC he marched his army to Phoenica and began to raise a naval force on the behalf of Polyperchon. Antigonus had spent the rest of 318 BC consolidating his position and gathering a fleet. He now used this fleet (under the command of Nicanor who had returned from Athens) against Polyperchon&#x27;s fleet in the Hellespont. In a two-day battle near Byzantium, Nicanor and Antigonus destroyed Polyperchon&#x27;s fleet. Then, after settling his affairs in western Asia Minor, Antigonus marched against Eumenes at the head of a great army. Eumenes hurried out of Phoenicia and marched his army east to gather support in the eastern provinces. In this he was successful, because most of the eastern satraps joined his cause (when he arrived in Susiana) more than doubling his army. They marched and counter-marched throughout Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Susiana and Media until they faced each other on a plain in the country of the Paraitakene in southern Media. There they fought a great battle, the battle of Paraitakene, which ended inconclusively. The next year (315) they fought another great but inconclusive battle, the battle of Gabiene, during which some of Antigonus&#x27;s troops plundered the enemy camp. Using this plunder as a bargaining tool, Antigonus bribed the Argyraspides who arrested and handed over Eumenes. Antigonus had Eumenes and a couple of his officers executed. With Eumenes&#x27;s death, the war in the eastern part of the Empire ended.

Antigonus and Cassander had won the war. Antigonus now controlled Asia Minor and the eastern provinces, Cassander controlled Macedon and large parts of Greece, Lysimachus controlled Thrace, and Ptolemy controlled Egypt, Syria, Cyrene and Cyprus. Their enemies were either dead or seriously reduced in power and influence.

==Third War of the Diadochi, 315–311 BC==
Though his authority had seemed secure with his victory over Eumenes, the eastern dynasts were unwilling to see Antigonus rule all of Asia. In 314 BC they demanded from Antigonus that he cede Lycia and Cappadocia to Cassander, Hellespontine Phrygia to Lysimachus, all of Syria to Ptolemy, and Babylonia to Seleucus, and that he share the treasures he had captured. Antigonus only answer was to advise them to be ready, then, for war. In this war, Antigonus faced an alliance of Ptolemy (with Seleucus serving him), Lysimachus, and Cassander. At the start of the campaigning season of 314 BC Antigonus invaded Syria and Phoenicia, which were under Ptolemy&#x27;s control, and besieged Tyre. Cassander and Ptolemy started supporting Asander (satrap of Caria) against Antigonus who ruled the neighbouring provinces of Lycia, Lydia and Greater Phrygia. Antigonus then sent Aristodemus with 1,000 talents to the Peloponnese to raise a mercenary army to fight Cassander, he allied himself to Polyperchon, who still controlled parts of the Peloponnese, and he proclaimed freedom for the Greeks to get them on their side. He also sent his nephew Ptolemaios with an army through Cappadocia to the Hellespont to cut Asander off from Lysimachus and Cassander. Polemaios was successful, securing the northwest of Asia Minor for Antigonus, even invading Ionia/Lydia and bottling up Asander in Caria, but he was unable to drive his opponent from his satrapy.

Eventually Antigonus decided to campaign against Asander himself, leaving his oldest son Demetrius to protect Syria and Phoenica against Ptolemy. Ptolemy and Seleucus invaded from Egypt and defeated Demetrius in the Battle of Gaza. After the battle, Seleucus went east and secured control of Babylon (his old satrapy), and then went on to secure the eastern satrapies of Alexander&#x27;s empire. Antigonus, having defeated Asander, sent his nephews Telesphorus and Polemaios to Greece to fight Cassander, he himself returned to Syria/Phoenica, drove off Ptolemy, and sent Demetrius east to take care of Seleucus. Although Antigonus now concluded a compromise peace with Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Cassander, he continued the war with Seleucus, attempting to recover control of the eastern reaches of the empire. Although he went east himself in 310 BC, he was unable to defeat Seleucus (he even lost a battle to Seleucus) and had to give up the eastern satrapies.

At about the same time, Cassander had young King Alexander IV and his mother Roxane murdered, ending the Argead dynasty, which had ruled Macedon for several centuries. As Cassander did not publicly announce the deaths, all of the various generals continued to recognize the dead Alexander as king, however, it was clear that at some point, one or all of them would claim the kingship. At the end of the war there were five Diadochi left: Cassander ruling Macedon and Thessaly, Lysimachus ruling Thrace, Antigonus ruling Asia Minor, Syria and Phoenicia, Seleucus ruling the eastern provinces and Ptolemy ruling Egypt and Cyprus. Each of them ruled as kings (in all but name).

==Babylonian War, 311–309 BC==

The Babylonian War was a conflict fought between 311 and 309 BC between the Diadochi kings Antigonus I Monophthalmus and Seleucus I Nicator, ending in a victory for the latter, Seleucus I Nicator. The conflict ended any possibility of restoration of the empire of Alexander the Great, a result confirmed in the Battle of Ipsus.

==Fourth War of the Diadochi, 307–301 BC==
Ptolemy had been expanding his power into the Aegean and to Cyprus, while Seleucus went on a tour of the east to consolidate his control of the vast eastern territories of Alexander&#x27;s empire. Antigonus resumed the war, sending his son Demetrius to regain control of Greece. In 307 he took Athens, expelling Demetrius of Phaleron, Cassander&#x27;s governor, and proclaiming the city free again. Demetrius now turned his attention to Ptolemy, invading Cyprus and defeating Ptolemy&#x27;s fleet at the Battle of Salamis. In the aftermath of this victory, Antigonus and Demetrius both assumed the crown, and they were shortly followed by Ptolemy, Seleucus, Lysimachus, and eventually Cassander.

In 306, Antigonus attempted to invade Egypt, but storms prevented Demetrius&#x27;s fleet from supplying him, and he was forced to return home. Now, with Cassander and Ptolemy both weakened, and Seleucus still occupied in the East, Antigonus and Demetrius turned their attention to Rhodes, which was besieged by Demetrius&#x27;s forces in 305 BC. The island was reinforced by troops from Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Cassander. Ultimately, the Rhodians reached a compromise with Demetrius – they would support Antigonus and Demetrius against all enemies, save their great ally Ptolemy. Ptolemy took the title of &quot;Soter&quot; (&quot;Savior&quot;) for his role in preventing the fall of Rhodes, but the victory was ultimately Demetrius&#x27;s, as it left him with a free hand to attack Cassander in Greece.

At the beginning of 304, Cassander managed to capture Salamis and besieged Athens. Athens petitioned Antigonus and Demetrius to come to their aid. Demetrius gathered a large fleet and landed his army in Boeotia in the rear of Cassander&#x27;s forces. He freed the cities of Chalkis and Eretria, renewed the alliance with the Boeotian League and the Aetolian League, raised the siege of Athens and drove Cassander&#x27;s forces from central Greece. In the spring of 303, Demetrius marched his army into the Peloponnese and took the cities of Sicyon and Corinth, he then campaigned in Argolis, Achaea and Arcadia, bringing the northern and central Peloponnese into the Antigonid camp. In 303–302 Demetrius formed a new Hellenic League, &quot;the League of Corinth&quot;, with himself and his father as presidents, to &quot;defend&quot; the Greek cities against all enemies (and particularly Cassander).

In the face of these catastrophes, Cassander sued for peace, but Antigonus rejected the claims, and Demetrius invaded Thessaly, where he and Cassander battled in inconclusive engagements. But now Cassander called in aid from his allies, and Anatolia was invaded by Lysimachus, forcing Demetrius to leave Thessaly and send his armies to Asia Minor to assist his father. With assistance from Cassander, Lysimachus overran much of western Anatolia, but was soon (301 BC) isolated by Antigonus and Demetrius near Ipsus. Here came the decisive intervention from Seleucus, who arrived in time to save Lysimachus from disaster and utterly crush Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus. Antigonus was killed in the fight, and Demetrius fled back to Greece to attempt to preserve the remnants of his rule there. Lysimachus and Seleucus divided up Antigonus&#x27;s Asian territories between them, with Lysimachus receiving western Asia Minor and Seleucus the rest, except Cilicia and Lycia, which went to Cassander&#x27;s brother Pleistarchus.

==The struggle over Macedon, 298–285 BC==
The events of the next decade and a half were centered around various intrigues for control of Macedon itself. Cassander died in 298 BC, and his sons, Antipater and Alexander, proved weak kings. After quarreling with his older brother, Alexander V called in Demetrius, who had retained control of Cyprus, the Peloponnese, and many of the Aegean islands, and had quickly seized control of Cilicia and Lycia from Cassander&#x27;s brother, as well as Pyrrhus, the King of Epirus. After Pyrrhus had intervened to seize the border region of Ambracia, Demetrius invaded, killed Alexander, and seized control of Macedon for himself (294 BC). While Demetrius consolidated his control of mainland Greece, his outlying territories were invaded and captured by Lysimachus (who recovered western Anatolia), Seleucus (who took most of Cilicia), and Ptolemy (who recovered Cyprus, eastern Cilicia, and Lycia).

Soon, Demetrius was forced from Macedon by a rebellion supported by the alliance of Lysimachus and Pyrrhus, who divided the Kingdom between them, and, leaving Greece to the control of his son, Antigonus Gonatas, Demetrius launched an invasion of the east in 287 BC. Although initially successful, Demetrius was ultimately captured by Seleucus (286 BC), drinking himself to death two years later.

==The struggle of Lysimachus and Seleucus, 285–281 BC==
Although Lysimachus and Pyrrhus had cooperated in driving Antigonus Gonatas from Thessaly and Athens, in the wake of Demetrius&#x27;s capture they soon fell out, with Lysimachus driving Pyrrhus from his share of Macedon. Dynastic struggles also rent Egypt, where Ptolemy decided to make his younger son Ptolemy Philadelphus his heir rather than the elder, Ptolemy Ceraunus. Ceraunus fled to Seleucus. The eldest Ptolemy died peacefully in his bed in 282 BC, and Philadelphus succeeded him.

In 282 BC Lysimachus had his son Agathocles murdered, possibly at the behest of his second wife, Arsinoe II. Agathocles&#x27;s widow, Lysandra, fled to Seleucus, who after appointing his son Antiochus ruler of his Asian territories, defeated and killed Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in Lydia in 281 BC. Seleucus hoped to take control of Lysimachus&#x27;s European territories, and in 281 BC, soon after arriving in Thrace, he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, for reasons that remain unclear.

==The Gallic invasions and consolidation, 280–275 BC==

Ptolemy Ceraunus did not rule Macedon for very long. The death of Lysimachus had left the Danube border of the Macedonian kingdom open to barbarian invasions, and soon tribes of Gauls were rampaging through Macedon and Greece, and invading Asia Minor. Ptolemy Ceraunus was killed by the invaders, and after several years of chaos, Demetrius&#x27;s son Antigonus Gonatas emerged as ruler of Macedon. In Asia, Seleucus&#x27;s son, Antiochus I, also managed to defeat the Celtic invaders, who settled down in central Anatolia in the part of eastern Phrygia that would henceforward be known as Galatia after them.

Now, almost fifty years after Alexander&#x27;s death, some sort of order was restored. Ptolemy ruled over Egypt, southern Syria (known as Coele-Syria), and various territories on the southern coast of Asia Minor. Antiochus ruled the Asian territories of the empire, while Macedon and Greece (with the exception of the Aetolian League) fell to Antigonus.

<text>New Edinburgh is a neighbourhood in Rideau-Rockcliffe Ward, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located to the northeast of the downtown core. It is bordered on the west by the Rideau River, to the north by the Ottawa River, to the south by Beechwood Avenue, and on the east by Springfield Road and the former Rockcliffe Park village limits.

The area is an older, affluent neighbourhood. The Governor General of Canada&#x27;s large residence and grounds are located in New Edinburgh, as is 24 Sussex Drive, official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada.

The neighbourhood is home to several embassies and consulates, including those of Spain, South Africa, France, India, Vietnam, and Slovakia. Civil servants (in particular, employees of the nearby Global Affairs Canada) compose a fair portion of the population. Like Rockcliffe Park, the neighbourhood is largely English-speaking, in comparison to the French-speaking district of Vanier to the south.

The total population of New Edinburgh is 3,539 (2016 Census).

==History==

New Edinburgh was founded by Thomas McKay, one of the builders of the Rideau Canal lock system. He bought the land at the junction of the Ottawa and Rideau Rivers in 1829 and created a village named for Edinburgh in his native Scotland. 
Often pronounced as rhyming with &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;, the traditional pronunciation would be &#x27;New Edinburrah&#x27; owing to McKay&#x27;s Scottish heritage. The streets in the neighbourhood were named after McKay&#x27;s family. Crichton was his wife&#x27;s maiden name, Keefer his son in law, while Thomas, John, and Charles were his sons. The area was originally largely industrial, home to a number of mills using the power of the river. Originally part of Gloucester Township, New Edinburgh was incorporated as a separate village in 1866 by a special act of parliament, but was annexed in 1887 by Ottawa.

In August 2000, The School of Dance moved into its building in New Edinburgh where the old Crichton Street Public School was situated.

New Edinburgh has their own local community newspaper, New Edinburgh News, assisted by many of the locals.

<text>Film Fun was a British celebrity comics comic book that ran from (issues dates) 17 January 1920 to 15 September 1962, when it merged with &quot;Buster&quot;, a total of 2,225 issues. There were also annuals in the forties and fifties. As the title suggests, the comic mainly featured comic strip versions of people from films from the 1920s to the 1960s.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Film Fun&quot; was launched by Amalgamated Press (they would later release similar titles like &quot;Radio Fun&quot;, &quot;Sports Fun&quot;, and &quot;TV Fun&quot;). Pre-war circulation at its peak was around 800,000 copies per week.

The title was renamed &quot;Film Fun and Thrills&quot; in 1959 (when Amalgamated Press was bought by the Mirror Group; later known as IPC). In 1962, sales of &quot;Film Fun&quot; dropped below 125,000 a week, prompting IPC to merge the comic with &quot;Buster&quot;.

===Mergers===
&quot;Picture Fun&quot; merged with &quot;Film Fun&quot; soon after its launch in 1920, followed by &quot;Kinema Comic&quot; in 1932, &quot;Film Picture Stories&quot; in 1935, &quot;Illustrated Chips&quot; in 1953, and &quot;Top Spot&quot; in 1960.

==Eddie the Happy Editor==
Frederick George Cordwell was better known to &quot;Film Fun&quot; fans as &quot;Eddie the Happy Editor.&quot; Cordwell edited the comic until his death in 1949, aged 62 in Richmond, Surrey. Cordwell wrote many scripts for the strips as well as text stories for &quot;Film Fun&quot;. He introduced the idea of characters receiving huge plates of bangers and mash, giant Christmas puddings, and pies and such from grateful beneficiaries of their efforts. Cordwell even made it into the stories himself, &quot;meeting&quot; Laurel and Hardy a number of times, Joe E. Brown, Wheeler and Woolsey and other characters.

==Content==
The cover of the first edition featured Harold Lloyd but named as &quot;Winkle&quot;, the screen name by which he was known in Britain at the time. Apart from Laurel and Hardy, &quot;Film Fun&quot; used to feature many film and stage comedians of that era like Charlie Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin, Jackie Coogan, Fatty Arbuckle, Joe E. Brown, George Formby, Wheeler &amp; Woolsey, Max Miller, Lupino Lane, Red Skelton, Harold Lloyd (named &quot;Winkle&quot; in those days), W. C. Fields, Terry-Thomas, Sid Field, Frank Randle, Morecambe and Wise, James Cagney, Tony Hancock, Sid James, The Goon Show, Frankie Howerd, Tommy Cooper, Martin and Lewis, Arthur Lucan (in his drag role as Old Mother Riley) and Bruce Forsyth. There would also be serialised cowboy films featuring stars like Roy Rogers and Gene Autry. There were also detective stories featuring a fictional detective named Jack Keen.

<doc id="637635" wikidata="Q584671" url="?curid=637635" title="Waiuku">
<text>Waiuku is a rural town in the Auckland region of New Zealand. It is located at the southern end of the Waiuku River, which is an estuarial arm of the Manukau Harbour, and lies on the isthmus of the Āwhitu Peninsula, which extends to the northeast. It is 40 kilometres southwest of Auckland city centre, and 12 kilometres north of the mouth of the Waikato River.

Settled in the 13th or 14th centuries, the Waiuku area was an important transportation hub, as the Te Pai o Kaiwaka portage was the preferred route for people travelling between the Waikato River and Manukau Harbour. The area became a centre for Ngāti Kahukōkā, a Waiohua hapū, by the 15th century. Ngāti Te Ata developed as a union between Waiohua and Waikato Tainui peoples, around the 17th century at Waiuku.

Waiuku became a trading port in 1851, facilitating trade between the Waikato River and the port of Onehunga, and Purapura, a Ngāti Te Ata village was established at the navigable head of the Awaroa Creek to the south. After the Invasion of the Waikato in 1863, the port of Waiuku suffered due to the lack of Māori produce being transported. By the end of the 19th century, Waiuku had begun developing into a centre for the dairy industry. In 1922, a railway line branch was constructed to Waiuku, and by 1955 Waiuku had grown enough to become an independent borough. In 1968, the Glenbrook steel mill opened in neighbouring Glenbrook, becoming a major employer in Waiuku.

==Etymology==

The name is a Māori name meaning &quot;Waters of Uku&quot;; being a type of clay used as a soap. The name recalls the story of a Ngāti Kahukōkā woman of high rank who was choosing between two suitors, Tamakau and Tamakae. Tamakae, having been working in the kūmara gardens, was taken to the river by the elders of the area to be washed using from the shores of the Waiuku River, before meeting his potential new wife. The location where Tamakae was washed was the western banks of the Waiuku River, directly behind where the Waiuku Museum stands today.

==Geography==

Waiuku is located at the southern end of the Waiuku River, an estuarial arm of the Manukau Harbour. It is close to the town of Pukekohe to the east, and is directly north of the Waikato River mouth. Prior to European settlement, the Waiuku area was primarily a dense kahikatea-dominated forest, with swamps areas near waterways. Since then, the majority of swamps have been drained.

===Climate===

==History==
===Māori history===
The Manukau Harbour has been settled by Tāmaki Māori since around the 13th or 14th centuries. Tāmaki Māori of the southern Manukau Harbour traditionally used the food resources of the harbour, collecting shellfish such as cockles, sea urchins and kōura, and fished species including snapper, kahawai and parore.

The Waiuku area was an important due to Te Pai o Kaiwaka, a portage which was the main route for transport between the Waikato River and the Manukau Harbour. The route followed the Awaroa Stream to the northernmost navigable point, after which waka were hauled overland to the Waiuku River. The portage was the preferred route, due to the unpredictable seas of the west coast. The existence of the portage meant that the Waiuku area has historically been difficult to settle during times of war.

The Waiohua hapū Ngāti Kahukōkā began occupying the southern Manukau Harbour and Waikato River mouth around the 15th century. Ngāti Kahukōkā&#x27;s main centres were Puketapu on the Āwhitu Peninsula, Tītī, near modern-day Mauku.

In the 17th century, Ngāti Kahukōkā were led by Te Ata-i-Rehia, granddaughter of Huakaiwaka, the eponymous ancestor of the Waiohua, a major confederation of iwi of the Tāmaki isthmus and South Auckland areas. Te Ata-i-Rehia was gifted land after Ngāti Kahukōkā were helped in conflicts by Waiohua. The iwi were also known by the name Te Ruakaiwhare, referencing the taniwha guardian of the Manukau Harbour, Kaiwhare, who looked over the tribe.Then took name from Te Ata I Rehia. Continuing to face invasions from neighbouring tribes, Te Ata-i-Rehia married the Ngāti Mahuta chief Tapaue. A new tribal identity grew from the union between Waiohua and Waikato Tainui. Upon her death, the iwi took the name Ngāti Te Ata, making Te Ata-i-Rehia the eponymous ancestor of the iwi. After the death of Tapaue, the couples&#x27; son Pāpaka secured Waiuku for Ngāti Te Ata. By 1700, Te Awaroa / Te Pae o Kaiwaka Pā had been established as a defensive fortification on the eastern banks of the Awaroa Creek, surrounded by a forested swamp. Ngāti Tamaoho, an iwi closely related to Ngāti Te Ata, began to have a presence on the Āwhitu Peninsula and southern Manukau Harbour by the 18th century.

====Musket Wars====
By the early 19th century, the southwestern Manukau Harbour and Waikato River mouth was a densely settled area, where interrelated hapū, Ngāti Te Ata, Ngāti Tamaoho, Ngāti Tiipa and Ngāti Pou, had established kāinga. In March 1822, a Ngāpuhi taua (war party) led by Hongi Hika attacked the Āwhitu Peninsula settlements. While Ngāti Te Ata successfully repelled the attackers at Waiuku, most members of Ngāti Te Ata fled the area for safety, with only a small number remaining for ahi kā (visible occupation land rights). In 1823 during the war, Hongi Hika hauled his waka over the portage at Waiuku, to reach the Waikato River. The area remained depopulated until the mid-1830s. As a result of the Musket Wars, the Waiohua and Waikato hapū of the southern Manukau developed closer ties.

===Early colonial era===

The first Europeans to live in the area arrived in September 1836, when Robert Maunsell chose Moeatoa as the location of the first Manukau Harbour Christian Missionary Society station. The Maunsells moved to Port Waikato in the following year, where they established the Te Kohanga Mission. By the late 1830s, Ngāti Tamaoho chief Ēpiha Pūtini began envisioning the Waiuku area as a planned European settlement, which would facilitate trade between the Manukau Harbour and the Waikato River. Ngāti Te Ata used the Waiuku portage to transport goods to the Manukau Harbour, until the Government funded the construction of a bullock track between the Waiuku and Awaroa rivers in the late 1840s.

The New Zealand Government sold Waiuku allotments to settlers in 1851. This included early settler Edward Constable, who established the Kentish Hotel in 1851 or early 1852. The hotel quickly became the focal point for the new settlement of Waiuku, which flourished as a trading port by the mid-1850s. Ngāti Te Ata and European settlers mingled together in the settlement, and Ahipene Kaihau, rangatira of Ngāti Te Ata, was a close confidant of Governor George Grey, who regularly invited to stay at Waiuku. Grey commissioned a ship to service the route between Onehunga and Waiuku.

By 1856, the Māori village of Purapura was established to the south of Waiuku, at the northernmost point on the Awaroa Creek navigable by waka. In 1856, five European families settled to the east at Mauku, and a church called St. Bride&#x27;s was established for the village. Mauku was the first European settlement visited by the first Māori King, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, after his coronation in 1858.

One of the founders of St Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church in Waiuku in the 19th century was Captain Sir John Makgill. Makgill arrived with his family in Waiuku in 1882 and established a farm called &#x27;Brackmont&#x27; at Taurangaruru. He eventually increased his holdings there to about 2500 acres, and also bought land at Orua Bay. Sir John Makgill died at Brackmont on 14 November 1906. His wife was Margaret Isabella Haldane, sister of Lord Haldane, and their eldest son was George Makgill who spent most of his adult life in Scotland, becoming 11th Baronet of Makgill on his father&#x27;s death. One other son John E Makgill continued to farm at Taurangaruru, while another Robert Haldane Makgill was a key figure in the development of New Zealand&#x27;s public health system. He was one of the country&#x27;s first district health officers, at a time when central government took on greater responsibility for public health. He was to play an important role during the 1918 influenza pandemic and its aftermath, notably as &#x27;the chief architect&#x27; of &#x27;the most useful legacy of the 1918 influenza pandemic&#x27;: the 1920 Health Act.

===Invasion of the Waikato===
In 1861, Governor George Grey ordered the construction of the Great South Road further into the Waikato, due to fears of potential invasion of Waikato Tainui. On 9 July 1863, due to fears of the Māori King Movement, Governor Grey proclaimed that all Māori living in the South Auckland area needed to swear loyalty to the Queen and give up their weapons. Most people refused due to strong links to Tainui, leaving for the south before the Government&#x27;s Invasion of the Waikato. Small numbers of people remained, in order to tend to their farms and for ahi kā. Most Māori who lived south of Auckland felt they had no choice due to their strong ties to Tainui and Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, and were forced to flee to the south.

Immediately prior to the war, the government constructed the Mauku Stockade near Waiuku. On 23 September 1863, a skirmish began at the Māori village of Tītī near Mauku, and nine European soldiers were killed. September saw a number of skirmishes between Ngāti Tamaoho and related hapū and the Mauku Company of Forest Rifles, led by Daniel H. Lusk.

While considered a &quot;friendly&quot; iwi by Grey during the war due to Grey&#x27;s relationship with Ahipene Kaihau, after the war a combined of Ngāti Te Ata land was confiscated by the Crown in December 1864, with further confiscations in early 1865. Most members of the iwi left for the Waikato in the aftermath of the war. After a period, some members of Ngāti Te Ata when some of the confiscated lands were returned, many living at Moeatoa Marae, opposite the modern Glenbrook Steel Mill, where the Christian Missionary Society mission had been located.

Waiuku township suffered as a trading post after the invasion, as Māori produce from the Waikato and Manukau were no longer sent through Waiuku. A canal scheme was proposed, that would link the Waikato River to the Manukau Harbour, but plans for the canal never progressed.

===Growth of Waiuku township===
In 1868, Edward Constable constructed flax mills at Purapura and Waipapa, which led to Waiuku becoming a centre for the flax trade in the 1870s. Between 1870 and 1900, Waiuku, Karaka and the Āwhitu Peninsula became major centres for the kauri gum industry.

Waiuku developed as a town when refrigeration made dairy farming financially viable in the late 19th century. Dairy pastures were developed to the south at Otaua and Aka Aka in the late 1880s. Development of the area was slow, in part due to the shallow port on the Waiuku River hindering ships at low tide. In 1901, oyster reserves were established along the Waiuku River, and by 1915, a butter factory had been established at Waiuku.

The first great Waiuku fire occurred on 28 August 1916, which destroyed many of the shops and offices to the east of Queen Street. The fire leads the Waiuku Town Board to proclaim that areas of central Waiuku could only have new buildings constructed from brick or masonry.

During the 1920s, 96 Ngāti Te Ata families were evicted from Moeatoa Marae. The land had gone into public administration after the death of the titled landholder of the marae land (the Māori Land Court having individuated Ngāti Te Ata land titles in the late 19th century).

On 5 January 1922, the Waiuku branch railway line was opened between Paerata and Waiuku. This led to the port of Waiuku no longer being used; with passenger services to Onehunga ceasing in 1925, and shipping ceasing a few years after. Within a few years, the railway was no longer financially viable, as local residents preferred to use roads. Passenger rail services to Waiuku were replaced by buses in 1948, and goods trains cease using the Waiuku branch line in 1967. A spur to the steel mill (detailed below) was opened in 1968, saving the line from being closed entirely.

In 1939, Ngāti Te Ata land southwest of Waiuku was requisitioned by the Department of Public Works, in order to protect land against coastal erosion, and to establish the Waiuku State Forest. Further land was requisitioned in 1959 to expand the forest.

By 1955, the town had grown enough that the Borough of Waiuku was created, independent from Franklin County.

In 1966, the New Zealand Government announced a scheme to establish a steel mill near Waiuku. The Glenbrook Steel Mill began operating in 1968, and from 1969 began harvesting ironsand from requisitioned Ngāti Te Ata lands along the Waikato River.

Over time, Waiuku has developed into a service centre for the surrounding rural area, and residence for many New Zealand Steel employees.

Waiuku has two marae affiliated with the Waikato Tainui hapū of Te Ākitai, Ngāti Paretaua and Ngāti Te Ata: Reretēwhioi Marae and its Arohanui meeting house, and Tāhuna Marae and its Teuwira meeting house.

== Local government ==

The first local government in the area were the Waipipi and Waiuku Highway Districts, which were formed in 1867 to administer road upkeep and public works projects. The highway districts split Waiuku township in two. Waiuku became a part of the Franklin County in 1914, and within a few months the Waiuku Town District was established on 29 July 1914, as an entity within the county. In 1939, the Waiuku Town Board offices were constructed on Queen Street opposite the Kentish Hotel, which were in use by 1940. By 1955, Waiuku had grown enough to become a borough, independent from the Franklin County. The Waiuku Borough had two majors during its existence: R. S. Whiteside who served from 1955 to 1971, and S. K. Lawrence, who served from 1971 to 1989.

In 1989, the Borough of Waiuku was merged with the newly formed Franklin District. In November 2010, all cities and districts of the Auckland region were amalgamated into a single body, governed by the Auckland Council.

Waiuku is a part of the Franklin local board area. The residents of Waiuku elect a local board, and one councillor from the Franklin ward to sit on the Auckland Council.

==Attractions==
The local pub, called The Kentish Hotel, is New Zealand&#x27;s longest continuously licensed hotel. It was built by one of the first European settlers in Waiuku, Edward Constable, as an inn in 1851. His presence can still be felt in the name of the pub (he was from Kent), and the street behind it - Constable Road. The Kentish, with its ornate verandahs, provides a historical centre point to the town and the nearby Tamakae Reserve.

At the entrance to the Reserve stands a statue of Tamakae carved from swamp kauri logs. The logs were found during some excavation work at New Zealand Steel and gifted to the local iwi (tribe), Ngati Te Ata. The Reserve also has a small historic &quot;village&quot; with several restored buildings including Hartmann House, dating back to 1886, now operating as a local craft studio, Pollock Cottage (1890), Waiuku Jail (1865) and The Creamery (1890s). The nearby Waiuku Museum has colonial era memorabilia, Māori artifacts, old sailing boats and historic photographs. A heritage trail around town points out further sites of historic interest in Waiuku including Wesley Methodist Church (1883), from where visitors to the town can get a panoramic view across Waiuku and the waterfront reserve.

Waiuku Museum, a museum on local history, opened in 1965.

Glenbrook Vintage Railway is a heritage railway opened in 1977. It operates the section of the Waiuku branch line from Glenbrook to Waiuku that was closed in 1967 and was in the process of being lifted.

The West Coast black sand beach, Karioitahi, is located nearby.

Waiuku has a pistol club with a ranges, and one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest airsoft clubs.

<doc id="637641" wikidata="Q443418" url="?curid=637641" title="Holly Golightly (singer)">
<text>Holly Golightly (born Holly Golightly Smith on 7 September 1966) is a British singer-songwriter. Her mother christened her after the main character of Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. Her musical style ranges from garage rock to R&amp;B.

==Musical career==
While she was dating Thee Headcoats&#x27; drummer Bruce Brand, Holly appeared in an impromptu singing performance with his band. Thee Headcoats founder Billy Childish subsequently added her to the lineup of The Delmonas and changed their name to Thee Headcoatees. The group was primarily a garage band that backed up Thee Headcoats. Golightly started her solo career in 1995 but continued as an active member of Thee Headcoatees until they disbanded in 1999. In her solo career, she has drawn from rhythm and blues, rockabilly, and sounds of the 1960s and earlier. 
She is a collector of rare old songs which she often covers.

She has released 13 albums of her own and has collaborated with other acts, including Billy Childish, Rocket from the Crypt and The White Stripes. She has two songs on the soundtrack of the Jim Jarmusch film &quot;Broken Flowers&quot;: &quot;There Is an End (featuring Holly Golightly)&quot; by the Greenhornes (which also appears on the Greenhornes album &quot;Dual Mono&quot;), and &quot;Tell Me Now So I Know&quot; (found on her album &quot;Truly She Is None Other&quot;), a song written by Ray Davies.

===2000s===

Golightly formed a duo in the mid-2000s, recording and touring extensively with longtime bandmate Lawyer Dave. Based in the United States, the duo, known as Holly Golightly and the Brokeoffs, released five albums and one EP between 2007 and 2012. Their first album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Buy a Gun When You&#x27;re Crying&quot;, is a reference to comedian Lord Carrett&#x27;s joke &quot;I learned a lot from my second marriage... I learned they won&#x27;t sell you a handgun if you&#x27;re crying...&quot; Holly Golightly &amp; the Brokeoffs were winners at the ninth annual Independent Music Awards for Best Americana Album, with &quot;Dirt Don&#x27;t Hurt&quot;. In 2003, she sang with The White Stripes on the track &quot;It&#x27;s True That We Love One Another&quot; on their fourth album, &quot;Elephant&quot;. &quot;Time Out New York&quot; described her as an &quot;English garage rock doyenne.&quot; In 2012, they released &quot;Sunday Run Me Over&quot;, their first album recorded entirely at their home in rural Georgia.

<text>The Battle of Corupedium, also called Koroupedion, Corupedion or Curupedion ( or Κόρου πεδίον, &quot;the plain of Kyros or Koros&quot;) was the last battle between the Diadochi, the rival successors to Alexander the Great. It was fought in 281 BC between the armies of Lysimachus and Seleucus I Nicator. Lysimachus had ruled Thrace for decades and parts of western Asia Minor ever since the Battle of Ipsus. Recently he had finally gained control over Macedon. Seleucus ruled the Seleucid Empire, including lands currently covered by modern eastern Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Iraq, and Iran. Almost nothing is known about the battle itself save that Seleucus won the battle. Lysimachus died during the fighting. According to Memnon of Heraclea&#x27;s &quot;History of Heraclea Pontica&quot;, Lysimachus was killed by a javelin thrown by Malacon, a Heracleian soldier serving under Seleucus.

Although the victory gave Seleucus nominal control over nearly every part of Alexander&#x27;s empire, save the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, his victory was short-lived. After crossing the Hellespont to take possession of Lysimachus&#x27; European holdings not long after the battle, Seleucus was assassinated by Ptolemy Keraunos and Macedon swiftly became independent once again.
The two men had been rivals for a long time as Lysimachus wished to expand his influence east, while Seleucus wished to expand his influence west, however, the event that actually started the war was the murder of Agathocles. Agathocles was the eldest son of Lysimachus and his first wife Nicaea and was the heir to his father’s realm. However, Lysimachus’ third and current wife, Arsinoe, wanted her children on the throne and so conspired with Ptolemy Keraunos to have Agathocles killed. They accused him of plotting with Seleucus to take the throne, and Lysimachus was convinced and put his son to death. This terrible act led many cities in Asia Minor to revolt against the rule of Thrace. Agathocles’ widow and their children fled to Seleucus, giving him an opportunity to attack Lysimachus when he was weak, which he could not refuse. He invaded and subsequently won at Corupedion.

<text>Ngũgĩ wa Mirii (1951 – 2/3 May 2008) was a Kenyan-Zimbabwean playwright, social worker and teacher, most known for his play &quot;Ngaahika Ndeenda&quot;, which he co-authored with fellow Gikuyu writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o. The play depicts the injustices and excesses of post-colonial Kenya, and was staged by non-intellectuals in an open-air theatre at the Kamirithu Educational and Cultural Center in Limuru.

==Early life==
Born in Roromo, Limuru, Kenya, Ngũgĩ wa Mirii was the second born in a family of six children born to John Mirii and Elizabeth Wanjiku. He was educated at Ngenia Secondary School and from 1972 to 1974 worked with the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. He obtained a diploma in Adult Education at the Institute of Adult Studies, Nairobi University, and then joined the Institute of Development Studies. While working there he became involved with peasants and workers in community development at Kamiriithu, Limuru.

In 1977, Ngũgĩ wa Mirii and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o co-authored a play titled &quot;Ngaahika Ndeenda&quot; (&quot;I Will Marry When I Want&quot;). Both playwrights were arrested six weeks after the play debuted, and detained in prison.

Five years later, their next play &quot;Mother Cry for Me,&quot; forced both playwrights into exile, with Ngũgĩ wa Mirii settling in Zimbabwe while Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o fled first to Britain, and then to the United States.

== Exile ==
In 1982, Ngũgĩ wa Mirii fled to Zimbabwe where he lived in exile. Ngũgĩ wa Mirii was joined a year later by his wife, Wairimu wa Ngũgĩ and one-year old daughter, Elizabeth Wanjiku Ngũgĩ. He then joined Zimbabwean Foundation for Education with Production (ZIMFEP) where he worked for several years.

In Zimbabwe, he wrote extensively about the Pan-African cause. In 1985, he was awarded funding to found the Zimbabwean Association of Community Theatre. He was granted Zimbabwean citizenship shortly after.

Ngũgĩ wa Mirii was known as a supporter of Robert Mugabe and Zanu-PF.

== Death ==
On 3 May 2008, Ngũgĩ wa Mirii died in a car accident in Zimbabwe, after he drove into a stationary lorry nearby the suburb of Eastlea. He was 57 at the time.
