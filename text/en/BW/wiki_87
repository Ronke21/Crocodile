<text>The Battle of Athens (sometimes called the McMinn County War) was a rebellion led by citizens in Athens and Etowah, Tennessee, United States, against the local government in August 1946. The citizens, including some World War II veterans, accused the local officials of predatory policing, police brutality, political corruption, and voter intimidation.

==Background==
In 1936, the E. H. Crump political machine based in Memphis, which controlled much of Tennessee, extended to McMinn County with the introduction of Paul Cantrell as the Democratic candidate for sheriff. Cantrell, who came from a wealthy and influential family in nearby Etowah, tied his campaign closely to the popularity of the Roosevelt administration. Cantrell rode FDR&#x27;s coattails to victory over his Republican opponent in what came to be known as the &quot;vote grab of 1936&quot;, which delivered McMinn County to Tennessee&#x27;s Crump Machine. Paul Cantrell was reelected sheriff in the 1938 and 1940 elections, and was elected to the state senate in 1942 and 1944, while his former deputy, Pat Mansfield, a transplanted Georgian, was elected sheriff those years. A state law enacted in 1941 reduced local political opposition to Crump&#x27;s officials by reducing the number of voting precincts from 23 to 12 and reducing the number of justices of the peace from fourteen to seven (including four &quot;Cantrell men&quot;). The sheriff and his deputies were paid under a fee system whereby they received money for every person they booked, incarcerated, and released. Because of this fee system, there was extensive &quot;fee grabbing&quot; from tourists and travelers. Buses passing through the county were often pulled over and the passengers were randomly ticketed for drunkenness, regardless of their intoxication or lack thereof. Between 1936 and 1946, these fees amounted to almost $300,000.

Cantrell engaged in electoral fraud, both by intimidating voters who voted against him, and by allowing ineligible people to vote. The U.S. Department of Justice had investigated allegations of electoral fraud in McMinn County in 1940, 1942, and 1944, but had not taken action. Voter fraud and vote control perpetuated McMinn County&#x27;s political problems. Manipulation of the poll tax and vote counting were the primary methods, but it was common for dead voters&#x27; votes to be counted in McMinn County elections. The political problems were further entrenched by economic corruption of political figures, who enabled gambling, bootlegging, and other illegal activity. Most of McMinn County&#x27;s young men were off fighting World , allowing appointment of some ex-convicts as deputies. These deputies furthered the political machine&#x27;s goals and exerted control over the citizens of the county. While the machine controlled law enforcement, its control also extended to the newspapers and schools. When asked if the local newspaper, &quot;The Daily Post Athenian&quot;, supported the GIs, veteran Bill White replied: &quot;No, they didn&#x27;t help us none.&quot; White elaborated: &quot;Mansfield had complete control of everything, schools and everything else. You couldn&#x27;t even get hired as a schoolteacher without their okay, or any other job.&quot;

During the war, two servicemen on leave were shot and killed by Cantrell supporters. The servicemen of McMinn County heard of what was going on and were anxious to return home and do something about it. According to a contemporaneous article by Theodore H. White in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, one veteran, Ralph Duggan, who had served in the Pacific in the navy and became a leading lawyer postwar, &quot;thought a lot more about McMinn County than he did about the Japs. If democracy was good enough to put on the Germans and the Japs, it was good enough for McMinn County, too!&quot; The scene was ripe for a confrontation when McMinn County&#x27;s GIs were demobilized. When they arrived home and the deputies targeted the returning GIs, one reported: &quot;A lot of boys getting discharged [were] getting the mustering out pay. Well, deputies running around four or five at a time grapping [sic] up every GI they could find and trying to get that money off of them, they were fee grabbers, they wasn&#x27;t on a salary back then.&quot;

In the August 1946 election, Paul Cantrell ran again for sheriff, while Pat Mansfield ran for the State Senate seat. Stephen Byrum, a local historian, speculates that the reason for this switch was an attempt to spread the graft. Bill White, meanwhile, claims the reason for the swap was because they thought Cantrell stood a better chance running against the GIs. The GIs were more hostile towards Sheriff Mansfield and his deputies rather than against Cantrell, whose period as sheriff had been relatively benign.

McMinn County had around 3,000 returning military veterans, constituting almost 10 percent of the county&#x27;s population. Some of the returning veterans resolved to challenge Cantrell&#x27;s political control by fielding their own nonpartisan candidates and working for a fraud-free election. A meeting was called in May 1946; veteran ID was required for admission. A non-partisan slate of candidates was selected.

Veteran Bill White described the veterans&#x27; motivation:

The members of the GI Non-Partisan League were very careful to make their list of candidates match the electoral demographics of the county, choosing three Republicans and two Democrats. A respected and decorated veteran of the North African campaign, Knox Henry, stood as candidate for sheriff in opposition to Cantrell.

Large contributions made by local businessmen to the GIs&#x27; campaign ensured that it was well-funded, although many of McMinn County&#x27;s citizens believed the machine would rig the election. The veterans capitalized on this belief with the slogan &quot;Your Vote Will Be Counted As Cast&quot;.

Well aware of the methods of Sheriff Mansfield and his associates, the League organized a counterpoise. A &quot;fightin&#x27; bunch&quot; was organized by Bill White &quot;to keep the thugs from beating up GIs and keep them from taking the election.&quot; White created his organization carefully; he later recalled: &quot;I got out and started organizing with a bunch of GIs. Well spirits—I learned that you get the poor boys out of poor families, and the ones that was frontline warriors that&#x27;s done fighting and didn&#x27;t care to bust a cap on you. I learned to do that. So that&#x27;s what I picked. I had thirty men and ... I took what mustering out pay I got and bought pistols. And some of them had pistols. I had thirty men organized&quot;. Sheriff Mansfield also organized for the upcoming election, hiring 200 deputies, most from neighboring counties, some from out of state, at $50 a day ().

== Initial confrontations ==

=== Water Works polling place ===
Polls for the county election opened August 1, 1946. Normally, there were about 15 patrolmen on duty for the precincts, but about 200 armed deputies were on patrol for the election, many of them from other counties and states. In Etowah, a GI poll watcher requested a ballot box to be opened and certified as empty. Although he was allowed by law to make the request, he was arrested and taken to jail. In Athens, Walter Ellis protested irregularities in the election and was also arrested and charged with what was explained to him as a &quot;federal offense&quot;.

Around 3:00 pm, C.M. &quot;Windy&quot; Wise, a patrolman, prevented an elderly African-American farmer, Tom Gillespie, from casting his ballot at the Athens Water Works polling place. When Gillespie and a GI poll watcher objected, Wise struck Gillespie with brass knuckles, which caused Gillespie to drop his ballot and run from the deputy. Wise then pulled his pistol and shot Gillespie in the back. Later, Wise was the only person to face charges from the events of August 1–2, 1946. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but only served one year before being paroled.

=== Response ===
GIs gathered in front of L. L. Shaefer&#x27;s store which was used as an office by campaign manager Jim Buttram. Buttram had telegraphed Governor McCord in Nashville and U.S. Attorney General Tom Clark asking for help in ensuring a lawful election, but received no response. When the group learned that Sheriff Mansfield had sent armed guards to all polling places, they convened at the Essankay Garage where they decided to arm themselves.

Sheriff Mansfield arrived at the Water Works and ordered the poll closed. In the commotion that followed, Wise and Karl Nell, the deputies inside the Water Works, took two poll watchers, Charles Scott and Ed Vestal, captive. By one account, Scott and Vestal jumped through a glass window and fled to the safety of the crowd while Wise followed behind. By another account there was a guns-drawn confrontation between Jim Buttram, who was accompanied by Scott&#x27;s father, and Sheriff Mansfield. A third account argues that when Neal Esminger from the &quot;Daily Post-Athenian&quot; showed up to get a vote count, his arrival was a distraction that allowed Scott and Vestal to break through a door to escape. In any case, the escape was followed by gunfire which sent the crowd diving for cover.

Someone in the crowd yelled, &quot;Let&#x27;s go get our guns&quot;, causing the crowd to head for the Essankay Garage. Deputy Chief Boe Dunn took the two deputies and the ballot box to the jail. Two other deputies were dispatched to arrest Scott and Vestal. These deputies were disarmed and detained by the GIs, as were a set of reinforcements. GI advisor, Republican Election Commissioner and Republican Party Chairman, Otto Kennedy, asked Bill White what he was going to do. White said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know Otto; we might just kill them.&quot; According to White, Kennedy grew alarmed and announced &quot;Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord! No! I&#x27;m not having nothing else to do with this. Me and my brother and son-in-law is leaving here.&quot; Lones Selber in &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine says Kennedy &quot;left, vowing to have no part in murder.&quot; The crowd and most GIs left. The remaining GIs took the seven deputies-turned-hostages to a woods ten miles from Athens, stripped them, tied them to a tree and beat them.

=== Twelfth precinct polling place ===
At the twelfth precinct the GI poll watchers were Bob Hairrell and Leslie Doolie, a one-armed veteran of the North African theater. The polling place was commanded by Mansfield man Minus Wilburn. Wilburn tried to let a young woman, who Hairrell believed was underage, vote. She had no poll tax receipt and was not listed in the voter registration. Hairrell grabbed Wilburn&#x27;s wrist when he tried to deposit the ballot in the box. Wilburn struck Hairrell on the head with a blackjack and kicked him in the face. Wilburn closed the precinct and took the GIs and ballot box across the street to the jail. Hairrell was brutally beaten and was taken to the hospital.

In response to foul language and taunts from the deputies, and the actions so far that day, Bill White, leader of the &quot;fighting bunch&quot;, told his lieutenant Edsel Underwood to take five or six men and break into the National Guard Armory to steal weapons. The GIs took the front door keys from the caretaker and entered the building. They then armed themselves with 70 rifles, two Thompson sub-machine guns, and ammunition. Lones Selber says White went for the guns himself. Bill White then distributed the rifles and a bandoleer of ammo to each of the 60 GIs.

=== Polls closing ===
As the polls closed, and counting began (minus the three boxes taken to the jail), the GI-backed candidates had a three-to-one lead. When the GIs heard the deputies had taken the ballot boxes to the jail, Bill White exclaimed, &quot;Boy, they doing something. I&#x27;m glad they done that. Now all we got to do is whip on the jail.&quot;

The GIs recognized that they had broken the law, and that Cantrell would likely receive reinforcements in the morning, so the GIs felt the need to resolve the situation quickly. The deputies knew little of battle tactics, but the GIs knew them well. By taking up the second floor of a bank across the street from the jail, the GIs were able to return fire from the jail with a barrage from above.

By 9:00 pm, Paul Cantrell, Pat Mansfield, George Woods (Speaker of the State House of Representatives and Secretary of the McMinn County Election Commission), and about 50 deputies were in the jail, allegedly rummaging through the ballot boxes. Woods and Mansfield constituted a majority of the election commission and could therefore certify and validate the count from within the jail.

== Battle ==
Estimates of the number of veterans besieging the jail vary from several hundred to as high as 2,000. Bill White had at least 60 under his command. White split his group with Buck Landers taking up position at the bank overlooking the jail while White took the rest to the post office.

Just as estimates of people involved vary widely, accounts of how the Battle of Athens began and its course of events diverge.

Egerton and Williams recall that when the men reached the jail, it was barricaded and manned by 55 deputies. The veterans demanded the ballot boxes but were refused. They then opened fire on the jail, initiating a battle that lasted several hours by some accounts, considerably less by others.

As Lones Selber, author of a 1985 &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine article, wrote: &quot;Opinion differs on exactly how the challenge was issued.&quot; White says he was the one to call it out: &quot;Would you damn bastards bring those damn ballot boxes out here or we are going to set siege against the jail and blow it down!&quot; Automatic weapons fire erupted, punctuated by shotgun blasts. &quot;I fired the first shot,&quot; White claimed, &quot;then everybody started shooting from our side.&quot; A deputy ran for the jail. &quot;I shot him; he wheeled and fell inside of the jail.&quot;

In 2000, Bill White claimed he said &quot;Boys, ... I&#x27;m going to tell them to bring the ballot box out of there, and if they don&#x27;t we&#x27;re gonna open up on them.&#x27; I hollered in there, I said, &#x27;You damn thieve grabbers, bring them damn ballot boxes out of there.&#x27; That&#x27;s just what I said. He didn&#x27;t make a move down there and finally one of them said, &#x27;By God I heard a bolt click.&#x27; Down there—one of them grabbers did, you know—they started scattering around. And I had a pistol in my belt with a shotgun. I had a shotgun and a rifle. And I pulled the pistol out and started firing down there at them. Well, when I did that, all that whole line up there started firing down there in there. A lot of them got in the jail, some of them didn&#x27;t, some of them got shot laying outside. And the battle started.&quot;

Byrum wrote in 1984 that there was a volley of fire that lasted for &quot;several hours&quot;, although gives no exact time for the end of hostilities or an account of the course of the battle. He noted that the deputies surrendered at 3:30 am.

The day after the battle, the &quot;New York Times&quot; front page reported a sheriff had been killed, and that the shooting had started with a shot through a jail window and with the demand the hostages be released. Then the &quot;Times&quot; reported the deputies refused and the siege ensued. The account followed, revealing the &quot;Times&quot; source as Lowell F. Arterburn, publisher of &quot;The Athens Post Athenian&quot;. Arterburn reported shots being fired, 2,000 persons milling around, and &quot;at least a score of fist fights were in progress&quot;.

An attempt by deputies outside the jail to reinforce (or take refuge in) the jail was thwarted by Bill White&#x27;s &quot;fighting band&quot;. Some people in the jail managed to escape out the back door. One of the escapees was George Woods who had telephoned Birch Biggs, the boss of next door Polk County, requesting that Biggs send reinforcements to break the siege. Biggs replied &quot;Do you think I&#x27;m crazy?&quot;

For the veterans it was either win before morning or face a long time in jail for violating local, state, and federal laws. Rumors spread that the National Guard or state troopers were coming. White made hourly demands for surrender. The GIs attempted to bombard the jail with Molotov cocktails but were not able to throw them far enough to reach the jail. The GIs decided to resort to dynamite. At about that time an ambulance pulled up to the jail. The GIs assumed it was called to remove the wounded and held their fire. Two men jumped in, and it sped off carrying Paul Cantrell and Sheriff Mansfield to safety out of town.

Then the dynamite was deployed. Bill White said, &quot;We&#x27;d put two or three sticks of dynamite together and tape it together and put a cap in there and a fuse. And we&#x27;d rear back and throw them. Well, we couldn&#x27;t get them all the way to the jail, but we got them out to them cars. They&#x27;d blow them cars up in the air and turn them over and land them back on the top. Several cars down there were blowing up.&quot; That first bomb landed under Bob Dunn&#x27;s cruiser, flipping it on its back. Bill White, commander of the &quot;fighting bunch&quot; knew the GIs had to do better: &quot;I ... said, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to have to get some charges up there on that jail.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Make a couple charges there... We&#x27;ll go down there and we&#x27;ll place some charges.&#x27; So I made up a couple charges and I crawled up and put a charge on the jailhouse porch.&quot; In fact three bombs went off almost simultaneously. One destroyed Mansfield&#x27;s car, one landed on the jail porch roof, and one went off against the jail wall. The bombs caused some damage to the jail and scattered debris.

As with the beginning of the battle, accounts of the end differ: &quot;American Heritage&quot; states, &quot;In the end, the door of the jail was dynamited and breached. The barricaded deputies—some with injuries—surrendered, and the ballot boxes were recovered.&quot;

The &quot;New York Times&quot; observed in an article the night was &quot;bloody&quot; and that it ended after the GIs detonated three &quot;home-made demolition charges&quot;.

=== End of the battle and vote counting ===
Byrum reported the end of the battle thusly: &quot;By 3:30 am, the men holding the jail had been dynamited into submission, and by early morning George Woods was calling Ralph Duggan to ask if he could come to Athens and certify the election of the GI slate. Bill White reported that &quot;when the GIs broke into the jail, they found some of the tally sheets marked by the machine had been scored fifteen to one for the Cantrell forces.&quot; When the final tally was completed, Knox Henry was elected.

During the fight at the jail, rioting had broken out in Athens, mainly targeting police cars. This continued after the ballot boxes were recovered, but subsided by morning. The mob also destroyed automobiles of the deputies, many bearing out-of-state plates. During the disorder the Mayor of Athens was on vacation and the city policemen were &quot;nowhere to be found&quot;.

The morning of August 2 found the town quiet. Some minor acts of revenge happened, but the public mood was one of &quot;euphoria that had not been experienced in McMinn County in a long time&quot;. Governor McCord initially moved to activate the National Guard, but quickly rescinded the order. The morning saw the GIs call a meeting. GI Non-Partisan League Treasurer Harry Johnson opened the meeting observing it was necessary because &quot;for some reason or other, the Sheriff&#x27;s force is not around.&quot; The approximately 400 persons in the court room elected a special committee headed by Methodist minister Bernie Hampton, joined by C. A. Anderson and Gobo Cartwright, both members of the Business Men&#x27;s Evangelical Committee, to preserve law and order. George Woods, the escaped Secretary of the County Election Commission, sent a written missive saying: &quot;Next Monday at 10 am I will sign an election certificate certifying that the GI ticket was elected.&quot; Later the veterans turned responsibility for maintaining order in Athens to Police Chief Herbert Walker. The GIs said they were still &quot;holding control&quot; of McMinn County until September 1 when Knox Henry was to be installed as sheriff.

August 2 also saw the return to McMinn County of Sheriff-elect Knox Henry, who had spent the night of August 1–2 in safe keeping in the Sweetwater jail. Sheriff Henry, a 33-year-old former Army Air Force sergeant, observed &quot;They were going to kill me yesterday, and I had to leave town.&quot;

== Nearby conflicts ==
In adjacent Meigs County, another use of weapons to effect electoral change occurred. On August 5, the Meigs County Election Commission certified Republican Oscar Womac as sheriff. Womac admitted to a reporter that he had ordered some associates to burn &quot;a bunch of ballots&quot;. The ballots, he claimed, were found in the Meigs County Courthouse the previous day. It was reported in &quot;The Chattanooga Times&quot; that Sheriff J. T. Pettit claimed the Peakland ballot box was taken at gun-point by Womac and companions from the County Clerk&#x27;s office the day before the ballot burning. &quot;There was little we could do to stop him, he was armed, and the four men with him were armed&quot;, Sheriff Pettit said. In Monroe County, east of McMinn County and north of Polk County, 65-year-old county sheriff Jake Tipton was shot and killed during a dispute at the Vale precinct.

==Aftermath==
The recovered ballots certified the election of the five GI Non-Partisan League candidates. Among the reforms instituted was a change in the method of payment and a $5,000 salary cap for officials. In the initial momentum of victory, gambling houses in collusion with the Cantrell regime were raided and their operations demolished. Deputies of the prior administration resigned and were replaced.

The ballots, when tallied, proved a landslide for the GI Non-Partisan League. Scores of veterans were present when Speaker of the state House of Representatives and secretary of the McMinn County election commissioners George Woods was marched into the County Courthouse under the guard of ex-GIs. Speaker Woods had fled after the gun battle. League member Knox Henry received 2,175 votes against 1,270 for Sheriff Cantrell. The League also won the other races: 2,194 to 1,270 for Frank Carmichael as trustee; George Painter won the county clerk race 2,175 to 1,198; the circuit court clerk broke 2,165 to 1,197 for Charles Picket.

Bill White, leader of the &quot;fighting bunch&quot;, was made a sheriff&#x27;s deputy. &quot;They put me in as a deputy. Because, one of the reasons they put me in as deputies was to scare them GIs. (Laughs) They wanted me to control the GIs. Which they did—they fired into them people&#x27;s houses and everything else. And that was my job to get out there and keep the GIs straight. And I did. I had sixteen fights in one weekend. Fighting GIs, keeping them from shooting them people&#x27;s houses and beating up people. My fists got so sore I couldn&#x27;t stick them in my pocket ... If you fight them with your fists, they had respect for you. But you didn&#x27;t use blackjacks or guns on them. If you did they&#x27;d gang up on you and kill you.&quot; According to deputy Bill White the fee basis for deputy pay continued for four more years. It was only the last four years he served that he was paid a salary.

In early September the fall of the county political machine was followed by the resignation of Athens&#x27; Mayor, Paul Walker, and the town&#x27;s four aldermen. The resignations met with popular approval. The resignations came after a night time shotgun blast through the front of Alderman Hugh Riggs&#x27;s home. Mayor Walker had previously refused a demand to resign made immediately after the gunfight by the McMinn County American Legion and VFW posts.

The &quot;Battle of Athens&quot; was followed by movements of veterans in other Tennessee counties promoting a statewide coalition against corrupt political machines in the upcoming November elections. Governor McCord countered an attempt to form a &quot;Non-Partisan GI Political League&quot; by directing the Young Democrats Clubs of Tennessee to recruit ex-GIs. There were strenuous efforts by the &quot;Crump Organization&quot;, based in Shelby County, to counter the nascent GI organization. A convention was held in Alamo, Tennessee, with the intention of establishing a new national party. The convention was discouraged by General Evans Carlson, USMC, who argued that the GIs should work through the existing political parties.

The new GI government of Athens quickly encountered challenges including the re-emergence of old party loyalties. On January 4, 1947, four of the five leaders of the GI Non-Partisan League declared in an open letter: &quot;We abolished one machine only to replace it with another and more powerful one in the making.&quot; The GI government in Athens eventually collapsed. Tennessee&#x27;s GI political movement quickly faded and politics in the state returned to normal. The Non-Partisan GI Political League replied to enquiries by veterans elsewhere in the United States with the advice that shooting it out was not the most desirable solution to political problems.

==Legacy==
Joseph C. Goulden, in his history of immediate post-war America, &quot;The Best Years 1945–1950&quot;, discussed the Battle of Athens, how it sparked political ex-GI movements in three other Tennessee counties, as well as other boss-ruled Southern states, led to a convention with representatives from several Southern states, and how it raised fears that veterans would resort to further violence. The Battle of Athens came in the mid-1940s, when there was much concern that returning GIs would be dangerously violent. Those concerns were addressed in an opinion piece by Warden Lawes, the author of &quot;Twenty Thousand Years at Sing Sing&quot;, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion piece. In a newspaper column, Eleanor Roosevelt had expressed a somewhat popular opinion that GIs should be checked for violent tendencies before they were demobilized. Bill White, the leader of Athens&#x27; &quot;fighting band&quot;, came to see her point. One of the reasons the GI League collapsed was the continuing GI-related violence in McMinn County. The Battle of Athens initially received criticism in the press. Coverage however quickly faded, and after Alan J. Gould, an executive with the Associated Press, told the Conference of State Directors of the Veterans Administration that the AP would try to suppress the use of the word &quot;veteran&quot; in conjunction with crime stories, the story of GI violence began to disappear.

<text>Shihad is the third studio album released by New Zealand rock band, Shihad.

Released in New Zealand in September 1996 on the Wildside Records label, it is sometimes known as &quot;the fish album&quot; - a reference to the fish that feature in the album&#x27;s artwork.

The album was dedicated to the memory of the band&#x27;s manager and friend, Gerald Dwyer, who had died earlier that year.

The album was recorded at York Street Studios, Auckland, New Zealand and produced &amp; engineered by Malcolm Welsford. Tracks include the singles &quot;La La Land&quot;, &quot;A Day Away&quot;, &quot;Home Again&quot; and &quot;Yr Head Is A Rock&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s A Go&quot; was released as a single in Europe and &quot;Ghost From The Past&quot; as a single in Australia. &quot;Home Again&quot; went on to be one of New Zealand&#x27;s biggest hits of all time.

<doc id="655849" wikidata="Q1563911" url="?curid=655849" title="Jean, Cardinal of Lorraine">
<text>Jean de Lorraine (9 April 1498 – c. 18 May 1550) was the third son of the ruling Duke of Lorraine, and a French cardinal, who was (at one time or another) archbishop of Reims (1532–1538), Lyon (1537–1539), and Narbonne (1524–1550), bishop of Metz, and Administrator of the dioceses of Toul, Verdun, Thérouanne, Luçon, Albi, Valence, Nantes and Agen (1538–1550). He was a personal friend, companion, and advisor of King Francis I of France. Jean de Lorraine was the richest prelate in the reign of Francis I, as well as the most flagrant pluralist. He is one of several cardinals known as the &quot;Cardinal de Lorraine&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Bar-le-Duc, Jean was the sixth child of twelve, of René II, Duke of Lorraine and his wife Philippa of Guelders, sister of Charles, Duke of Guelders. He was a younger brother of Antoine, Duke of Lorraine and Claude, Duke of Guise. His younger brother, François, Comte de Lambesc, died in the Battle of Pavia in 1525. In 1520 his mother retired to the Convent of S. Claire du Pont-à-Mousson, where she became a professed nun.

===Bishop of Metz===
In 1500 baby Jean succeeded Cardinal Raymond Peraudi as Coadjutor of his uncle Henri de Vaudemont-Lorraine, Bishop of Metz. The Chapter of the Cathedral gave its consent, on 3 November 1500, and Pope Alexander VI gave his consent in 1501. The Cardinal was compensated for his trouble with the monastery of S. Mansu in Toul. The purpose of such a strange arrangement was the desire of Duke René to keep the bishopric of Metz in family hands. Bishop Henri formally resigned the See of Metz on 16 July 1505 in favor of his nephew Jean, but, due to Jean&#x27;s extreme youth, Henri continued as Administrator until his own death on 20 October 1505. From that point the Cathedral Chapter, whose Dean was the Bishop of Toul, assumed responsibility for the administration of the diocese, until Jean de Lorraine became twenty in 1518, with Jean receiving one-third of the episcopal revenues. Spiritual functions were in the hands of the Bishop of Nicopolis, Conrad de Heyden, O.Cist., suffragan of Metz.

Despite his youth, on 19 October 1517, following the death of Bishop Hugh de Hazards, Jean de Lorraine was elected Bishop of Toul by the Chapter of the cathedral. He resigned the bishopric in 1524.

It is conjectured that Jean was introduced to the French Court and met King Francis for the first time at the wedding of his brother Antoine to Renée de Bourbon on 26 June 1515.

===Cardinal===

On 28 May 1518 Jean de Lorraine, Bishop of Metz, aged twenty, was created a Cardinal-Deacon by Pope Leo X in his seventh Consistory for the creation of cardinals. Jean was the only cardinal created on that occasion. Leo, who had been made a cardinal himself at the age of thirteen, could hardly refuse the King of France on the grounds of youth. On 7 January 1519 he was assigned the Deaconry of S. Onofrio in Trastevere, and his red hat was sent to him in France. He visited Rome in April 1521, at which time he was admitted to Consistory. He had already returned home when Leo X died on 1 December 1521, and thus he did not attend the Conclave of 27 December 1521 − 9 January 1522, which elected Cardinal Adrian Florenszoon Dedel, who took the throne name Pope Adrian VI.

In 1520 Jean de Lorraine was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, along with Cardinals Adrien Gouffier de Boissy, François Louis de Bourbon, and Amanieu d&#x27;Albret; but he played no political role. And indeed his non-political position continued to be the case throughout the 1520s.

Cardinal Jean de Lorraine was appointed Bishop of Terouanne (Morinensis) on 29 October 1521, taking possession of his church on 7 January 1522. He held the See until 1535. From 1522 his career path is that of an individual who enjoys without interruption the favor of the King, all the way to the King&#x27;s death in 1547. He enjoyed the status of favorite, along with the realities of familiar and counsellor.

===Archbishop of Narbonne===
On 7 January 1524 Cardinal Jean was named Archbishop of Narbonne, in succession to Giulio de&#x27; Medici who had been elected Pope Clement VII. He held the church until his death.

In August 1527 the Cardinal de Lorraine was appointed by King Francis to meet and greet Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who had come to France to negotiate with King Francis, and to escort him to the French Court. He was not yet a royal advisor or a member of the Royal Council, but was being tested and groomed. He was, after all, only twenty-nine years old. Negotiations were conducted with Wolsey by royal commissioners, leading to the Treaty of Amiens, ratified by the King on 18 August.

The treaty addressed the joint English and French reaction to the Sack of Rome (1527) in May 1527 and the imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in the Castel S. Angelo. But the Cardinal de Lorraine had no part in that business. The principal negotiator was the Chancellor, Antoine du Prat. He was, however, one of the four French cardinals who were present at Compiègne on 16 September and wrote, under Wolsey&#x27;s leadership as Papal Legate, to the Pope, informing him that they were praying for his release from captivity and planned, if the Emperor should not accommodate them, to refuse any papal orders issued under duress. He also witnessed the investing of the Chancellor, Antoine du Prat, with the symbols of the cardinalate which had been granted him by the Pope at the request of King Francis. His growing importance is reflected in a list of precedence of 1528, in which he and the King of Navarre follow immediately after the King.

===Abbeys: Cluny, Fécamp, Gorze===

In 1528 he was named Abbot Commendatory of the Abbey of Cluny by King Francis I, a benefice he held until his death in 1550. The monks of Cluny had tried to reassert their old rights of election, and had chosen Jacques le Roy, Abbot of Saint-Florent, to be the new abbot of Cluny, but the King and the Pope intervened, in accordance with the Concordat of Bologna of 1516, and Le Roy was made Archbishop of Bourges instead.

On 1 August 1530, Pope Clement VII granted the Cardinal of Lorraine an indult allowing him to hold and accumulate the benefices in his diocese of Narbonne and the benefices of his abbeys.

On 26 March 1531, King Francis signed an order to his treasurer to pay his lost wagers to the Sieur de Villiers, the result of a tennis match with the Cardinal de Lorraine and others on March 1.

In 1532, Jean de Lorraine was named Abbot Commendatory of the royal abbey of Fécamp by the patronage of King Francis I. He held the Abbey during his lifetime. In 1534 Pope Paul III named Cardinal de Lorraine his Apostolic Legate in the dioceses of Metz, Toul and Verdun.

Part of his ecclesiastical preferment he gave up in favour of his nephews, as part of the strategy of establishing the family of Lorraine permanently in various benefices.

Pope Clement VII died on 25 September 1534, having lived 56 years. The Conclave of 1534 opened on 10 October 1534, and Cardinal de Lorraine was present as the leader of the French faction, which numbered between ten and twelve members. Their candidate was Cardinal François de Tournon, who had negotiated the marriage of Henri, King Francis&#x27; second son, and Catherine de&#x27; Medici. Cardinal Alessandro Farnese was supported by Cardinal Ippolito d&#x27;Este and his fellow Florentine cardinals who had been created by Clement VII. The Italians favored Agostino Trivulzio, the Protector of France before the Holy See and the holder of several French episcopal benefices, whose uncles were Marshals of France, but he realized that he could not marshal sufficient votes to be elected. He therefore threw his support behind the oldest of the cardinals, Alessandro Farnese, hoping that Farnese&#x27;s reign would be a short one and that he would be in a better position at the next conclave. Farnese was elected by acclamation on 11 October, the first day of voting, and was formally elected by ballot the next morning. He chose the name Paul III, and reigned for fifteen years. Trivulzio died the year before Paul did.

===Royal Councillor===
He became a regular member of the royal council in 1530. In 1536 he was entrusted with an embassy to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. He met the Emperor, who was travelling north to Genoa, at Siena on 24 April 1536. He spent three days with the Emperor explaining the concessions which Francis I was prepared to make, but Charles was prepared for war, and rejected the French overtures. After a quick trip to Rome to inform the Pope of the situation and to discover what the Pope&#x27;s intentions were, Jean de Lorraine headed back north toward Bologna to try one last time to argue peace to the Emperor. The Pope, who was trying to maintain neutrality, sent legates to both sovereigns on 29 April to argue for peace, but it was without effect. The invasion of southern France by the Emperor was inevitable.

There survives a document showing that on 12 July 1536 the Cardinal de Lorraine was possessed of the dioceses of Metz, Toul and Verdun, of the Abbey of Gorze in southern Lorraine (1533–1542), and of the castellanies of Hattonchâtel, Dombasle-en-Argonne, Thilly, Mangiennes, Fresnes-en-Woevre, Dieudouard, and Sampigny. In 1537 he was granted the Abbey of Saint-Médard in Soissons, which he held for two years.

When the Dauphin Francis died at Château Tournon-sur-Rhône on 10 August 1536, the rest of the courtiers tried to delay presenting the disastrous news by telling the King that the Dauphin was increasingly ill. When Francis finally realized he was being lied to, it was the Cardinal de Lorraine who was left alone with the King by the courtiers and he had to confirm the news of the death of the King&#x27;s son. The King retired to indulge his grief without witnesses, and left it to Cardinal de Lorraine to make the appropriate arrangements.

In April–May 1537, Jean de Lorraine was sent as Ambassador to the Emperor and granted powers to negotiate with him. He returned to Court on 17 May. In accordance with the Concordat of Bologna of 1516, King Francis nominated Jean de Lorraine to the diocese of Lyon in 1537. He took possession of the diocese by procurator on 13 August 1537, and was immediately sent along with the Constable, Anne de Montmorency, on a diplomatic mission to the Emperor to put the final touches on a treaty of peace between France and the Empire. They returned to Narbonne on 13 January 1538, and Montmorency returned to report to the King at the end of January. In May and June the pair were at Nice, engaged in additional negotiations with the Emperor. On his return he resigned the administration of the diocese of Lyon in favor of Cardinal Ippolito d&#x27;Este, who was appointed by King Francis and whose bulls were dated 29 October 1539. The Cardinal de Lorraine had been Administrator for only two years and two months.

The Cardinal de Lorraine travelled with King Francis to Aigues-Mortes for his meeting with the Emperor Charles, which took place between 14 and 17 July 1538, and was present at at least one private meeting.

On 14 August 1540 the Cardinal de Lorraine renounced all his interests in the succession to the Duchy of Lorraine in favor of his brother, for a consideration of 50,000 francs.

On 22 March 1542, King Francis signed letters ratifying the nomination of the Cardinal de Lorraine as Abbot Commendatory of the Abbey of Blanche-Couronne in Brittany (1542–1548).

A document of 11 April 1544 indicates that the Cardinal was possessed of the Abbeys of Fécamp, Saint-Ouen, Marmoutier, and the Priory of La-Charité, from which the King had ordered extraordinary cutting of old-stand trees in their forests for the purpose of building galleys. The Cardinal was instructed to deliver the timber to Rouen at his expense.

===Patronage===

The Cardinal was also an open-handed patron of art and learning, as the protector and friend of the humanist scholar Erasmus, the poet and translator Clément Marot, and the satirist Rabelais. It has been argued that the character of Panurge in &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; is based on the Cardinal de Lorraine, and his residence at the Hôtel de Cluny.

In 1527, upon the recommendation and urging of Erasmus, the Cardinal de Lorraine took on Claude Chansonette (Cantiuncula) as his Chancellor.

In 1537 Benvenuto Cellini, the Florentine jeweler, sculptor, and medallist, was in Paris, and was commissioned to create several pieces for King Francis I. On one occasion, the King invited Cellini to an after-dinner gathering, at which he found himself in the company of Mme. d&#x27;Estampes, the Cardinal de Lorraine, and the King of Navarre and his wife, Marguerite, the sister of King Francis, the Dauphin and the Dauphine. Cellini produced a medal of the Cardinal de Lorraine. The reverse shows the allegorical figure Truth, holding a mirror and a compass, with the legend SIC•ITUR•AD•ASTRA (&#x27;This is the way to the stars&#x27;).

In 1549 at Piacenza (&quot;not&quot; the Plaisance in the south of France) he met the Franciscan André Thevet, one of the future chaplains of Queen Catherine de&#x27; Medici, and encouraged him (&quot;par l&#x27;autorité et faveur duquel, j&#x27;ay eu l&#x27;opportunité de faire le voyage de Ierusalem&quot;) to make his journey to the Holy Land and the Levant, which began his career as a cosmographer.

===Conclave of 1549–1550===
Cardinal Jean de Lorraine participated in the Conclave following the death of Pope Paul III, which began on 29 November 1549. The Cardinal de Guise, Jean de Lorraine&#x27;s nephew, had been instructed (by the King, it was said) to support the Cardinal de Lorraine, then the Cardinal de Tournon, and any other French cardinals; failing those, he was to work for Salviati, Ridolfi or de Cupis. Ridolfi took himself out of the contest when he died during the Conclave. It is recorded that, on the fifteenth Scrutiny on 18 December, even before Guise&#x27;s arrival, Lorraine had received five votes. Jean de Lorraine, though, did not arrive in the Conclave until 29 December, by which time alliances and antipathies had solidified. In the evening of 7/8 February 1550, Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, aged sixty-three, was elected and chose the throne name Julius III. Julius III, was crowned on 22 February 1550, the Feast of St. Peter&#x27;s Chair.

The Cardinal de Lorraine died from a stroke in Neuvy-sur-Loire on 18 May 1550, on his way back to France from Italy. He was buried in Nancy in the Church of Saint-François-des-Cordeliers. In his Last Will and Testament, he left 30,000 livres to the poor orphans of the Three Bishoprics, Metz, Toul, and Verdun.

<doc id="655858" wikidata="Q406294" url="?curid=655858" title="Ahmad">
<text>Ahmad () is an Arabic male given name common in most parts of the Muslim world. Other English spellings of the name include Ahmed and Ahmet. Ahmad and It is also used as a surname.

== Etymology ==
The word derives from the root (ḥ-m-d), from the Arabic (), from the verb (&quot;ḥameda&quot;, &quot;to thank or to praise&quot;), non-past participle ().

== Lexicology ==
As an Arabic name, it has its origins in a Quranic prophecy attributed to Jesus in the Quran which most Islamic scholars concede is about Muhammad. It also shares the same roots as Mahmud, Muhammad and Hamed. In its transliteration, the name has one of the highest number of spelling variations in the world.

Some Islamic traditions view the name Ahmad as another given name of Muhammad at birth by his mother, considered by Muslims to be the more esoteric name of Muhammad and central to understanding his nature. Over the centuries, some Islamic scholars have suggested the name&#x27;s parallel is in the word &#x27;Paraclete&#x27; from the Biblical text, although this view is not universal considering translations, meanings and etymology.

Traditional Islamic sources, such as Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and others contain hadith in which Muhammad personally refers to himself as Ahmad. Christian orientalists such as W. Montgomery Watt, however, were able to show that the use of Ahmad as a proper name for &quot;Muhammad&quot; did not exist until well into the second Islamic century, previously being used only in an adjectival sense. Watt concludes that the development of the term being used as a name in reference to Muhammad came later in the context of Christian-Muslim polemics, particularly with Muslim attempts to equate Muhammad with the Biblical &#x27;Paraclete&#x27;, owing to a prophecy attributed to Jesus in the Quranic verse 61:6.

== Interpretations and meanings of Ahmad ==
=== Development ===
Regarding Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s biography of Muhammad, the Sirat Rasul Allah, Islamic scholar Alfred Guillaume wrote:

=== Ahmad passage ===
Here are two translations of the passage in question in :

The verse in the Quran attributes a name or designation, describing or identifying who would follow Jesus. In his Farewell Discourse to his disciples, Jesus promised that he would &quot;send the Holy Spirit&quot; to them after his departure, in stating: &quot;whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth... shall bear witness of me.&quot; states &quot;[even] the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.&quot;

Regarding verse 61: 6 in the Quran:

Contrary to the above claim that Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham did not mention Ahmad and the respective passage, there is Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s work with the title Kitab al-Maghazi and Ibn Hisham who mention and connect the words Mohammad &amp; Ahmad with the Paraclete. Additionally it has been documented that there was an attempt to connect the respective quranic verse with the Paraclete even earlier then Ibn Ishaq. Moreover, a later interpolation of this passage to the Quran, just to serve as an ex eventu prove for the early Muslim scholars, has also been refuted in modern Islamic Studies. This is supported by the fact that the earliest as well as the later manuscripts of the Quran contain the exact passage and wording in Surah 61.

=== Scholarship regarding the Greek translation ===
&quot;Early translators knew nothing about the surmised reading of periklutos for parakletos, and its possible rendering as Ahmad …. Periklutos does not come into the picture as far as Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham are concerned. The deception is not theirs. The opportunity to introduce Ahmad was not accepted – though it is highly improbable that they were aware of it being a possible rendering of Periklutos. It would have clinched the argument to have followed the Johannine references with a Quranic quotation.&quot;

&quot;Furthermore the Peshitta, Old Syriac, and Philoxenian versions all write the name of John in the form Yuhanan, not in the Greek form Yuhannis.. Accordingly to find a text of the Gospels from which Ibn Ishaq could have drawn his quotation we must look for a version which differs from all others in displaying these characteristics. Such a text is the Palestinian Syriac Lectionary of the Gospels which will conclusively prove that the Arabic writer had a Syriac text before him which he, or his informant, skillfully manipulated to provide the reading we have in the Sira.&quot;.

&quot;Muslim children are never called Ahmad before the year 123AH. But there are many instances prior to this date of boys called &#x27;Muhammad.&#x27; Very rarely is the name &#x27;Ahmad&#x27; met with in pre-Islamic time of ignorance (Jahiliya), though the name Muhammad was in common use. Later traditions that the prophet&#x27;s name was Ahmad show that this had not always been obvious, though commentators assume it after about 22 (AH).&quot;

&quot;It has been concluded that the word Ahmad in Quran as-Saff 61:6 is to be taken not as a proper name but as an adjective... and that it was understood as a proper name only after Muhammad had been identified with the Paraclete.&quot;

&quot;Note that by the middle of the 2nd century AH, Muslims already identified Muhammad with the Greek word &quot;Paracletos&quot; (Counsellor / Advocate) or the Aramaic translation &quot;Menahhemana.&quot;

=== Alleged historical document regarding the topic ===
Text of the correspondence between `Umar II and Leo III:

&quot;We recognize Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John as the authors of the Gospel, and yet I know that this truth, recognized by us Christians wounds you, so that you seek to find accomplices for your lie. In brief, you admit that we say that it was written by God, and brought down from the heavens, as you pretend for your Furqan, although we know that it was `Umar, Abu Turab and Salman the Persian, who composed that, even though the rumor has got round among you that God sent it down from heavens…. [God] has chosen the way of sending [the human race] Prophets, and it is for this reason that the Lord, having finished all those things that He had decided on beforehand, and having fore-announced His incarnation by way of His prophets, yet knowing that men still had need of assistance from God, promised to send the Holy Spirit, under the name of Paraclete, (Consoler), to console them in the distress and sorrow they felt at the departure of their Lord and Master. I reiterate, that it was for this cause alone that Jesus called the Holy Spirit the Paraclete, since He sought to console His disciples for His departure, and recall to them all that He had said, all that He had done before their eyes, all that they were called to propagate throughout the world by their witness. Paraclete thus signifies &quot;consoler&quot;, while Muhammad means &quot;to give thanks&quot;, or &quot;to give grace&quot;, a meaning which has no connection whatever with the word Paraclete.&quot;

However the authenticity of the correspondence has been put into question by scholars.

== Transliterations ==
&quot;Ahmad&quot; is the most elementary transliteration. It is used commonly all over the Muslim world, although primarily in the Middle East. More recently, this transliteration has become increasingly popular in the United States due to use by members of the African American community.

&quot;Ahmed&quot; is the most common variant transliteration, used especially in the context of the Ottoman Empire. This transliteration is also used throughout the Muslim world.

&quot;Ahmet&quot; is the modern Turkish transliteration. Modern Turkish uses a Latin-based alphabet, and most Arabic-derived names have standardized Turkish spellings.

The less common transliterations of &quot;Ahmad&quot; are used by Muslims outside the Middle East proper, such as in Indonesia and Russia. For Bashkirs and Tatars, the name is Әхмәт (Äxmät / Əxmət).

&quot;Achmat&quot; is the fairly standard transliteration used by South Africa&#x27;s Muslim community, and its pronunciation shows evidence of the influence of Afrikaans: the &lt;ch&gt; which represents ح [ħ] is pronounced as an Afrikaans &lt;g&gt; [x] (i.e. closer to the Arabic خ); and the د [d] is realised as a [t] (closer to the Arabic ت) which follows Afrikaans Final-obstruent devoicing principles.

<text>&quot;O Arise, All You Sons&quot; is the national anthem of Papua New Guinea. Adopted in 1975, it was written and composed by Thomas Shacklady.

== History ==
The National Identity Act of Papua New Guinea was formulated in 1971, motivating the country to create a national flag, a national emblem, a national pledge and a national anthem. A national flag and emblem were adopted in 1971. However, the national anthem remained undecided until independence from Australia in 1975, four years later. Although many songs were submitted to be the anthem, the National Executive Council decided a week before the country&#x27;s Independence Day (10 September 1975), to adopt as the national anthem a composition that was composed by Chief Inspector Thomas Shacklady (1917–2006), a bandmaster of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary Band.

During the 2015 Pacific Games opening ceremony, the anthem was sung with the first line altered from &quot;O arise all you sons of this land&quot; to &quot;O arise sons and daughters of this land&quot;. An official later stated that this was illegal and a violation of the National Identity Act.

==History==

===1901 to 2000===

The Imperial Tobacco Company was created in 1901, in response to the price war in the British market promoted by &quot;Buck Duke&quot;&#x27;s American Tobacco Company. It amalgamated 13 British tobacco and cigarette companies: W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills of Bristol (the leading manufacturer of tobacco products at that time), John Player &amp; Sons of Nottingham, Stephen Mitchell &amp; Son of Glasgow, and 10 other independent family businesses. The other, smaller companies, involved in the amalgamation included Lambert &amp; Butler, William Clarke &amp; Son, Franklyn Davey, Edwards Ringer &amp; Bigg, Hignett Brothers, Hignett&#x27;s Tobacco, Adkins &amp; Sons, Richmond Cavendish, D&amp;J MacDonald, and F&amp;J Smith. In 1902 the printing and packaging firm, Mardon, Son &amp; Hall was absorbed. In 1904, James &amp; Finlay Bell Ltd was merged into the Stephen Mitchell &amp; Son branch. The Company&#x27;s first chairman was William Henry Wills of the Wills Company.
In 1902, the Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company agreed to form a joint venture: the British-American Tobacco Company Ltd. The parent companies agreed not to trade in each other&#x27;s domestic territory and to assign trademarks, export businesses, and overseas subsidiaries to the joint venture. It built the Imperial Tobacco Company Building at Mullins, South Carolina, between 1908, and 1913. The company expanded the tobacco growing enterprises in the United States that WD &amp; HO Wills had developed before the amalgamation of 1901. It also established its own leaf-buying organisation in the United States through its building, the Imperial Tobacco Warehouse, in Durham, North Carolina, which is now owned, and has been renovated by, Measurement Incorporated. Whereas American Tobacco sold its share of BAT in 1911, a divestiture prompted by Supreme Court rulings in an anti-trust case, Imperial maintained an interest in British American Tobacco until 1980. 

In 1973, the Imperial Tobacco Company, having become increasingly diversified by acquisition of (amongst others) restaurant chains, food services and distribution businesses, changed its name to Imperial Group while tobacco products continued to be sold by a newly formed subsidiary named Imperial Tobacco Limited.

In 1986, the company was acquired by the conglomerate Hanson Trust plc for £2.5 billion. Divestments during the period of ownership by Hanson included Courage Brewery to Elders, Golden Wonder to Dalgety, Finlays to Arunbhai J. Patel, the wholesaling arm of Sinclair &amp; Collis to Palmer &amp; Harvey, Imperial Hotels and Catering to Trust House Forte and Ross Frozen Foods to United Biscuits. This also led to a dispute over pension payments to employees, as seen in &quot;Imperial Group Pension Trust Ltd v Imperial Tobacco Ltd&quot;. In 1996, following a decision to concentrate on core tobacco activities, Hanson de-merged Imperial and it was listed as an independent company on the UK stock exchange.

===2000 to present===

In 2003, Imperial acquired the world&#x27;s then fourth-largest tobacco company, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH of Germany: the deal added brands such as Davidoff, Peter Stuyvesant, and West to its portfolio. In 2007, Imperial Tobacco entered the United States tobacco market with its $1.9-billion acquisition of Commonwealth Brands Inc., then the fourth-largest tobacco company in the US. In February 2008, Imperial acquired the world&#x27;s then fifth-largest tobacco company, Altadis, whose brands included Fortuna, Gauloises Blondes, and Gitanes. A number of factory closures were subsequently announced, including the long-running cigar factory in Bristol.

Following the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s decision in January 2010, to ban the display of tobacco products in shops, as well as the availability of tobacco vending machines in public buildings with effect from autumn 2011, Imperial Tobacco attempted to challenge the change in the law on the grounds that regulations of the sale goods rested with the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. However, this case was dismissed on 30 September 2010 by Lord Bracadale in the Court of Session in Edinburgh.

In 2011, Altadis USA Inc. said it would add to its Fort Lauderdale, Florida, headquarters and move Commonwealth Brands Inc. employees from Bowling Green, Kentucky. The company&#x27;s name changed to Commonwealth-Altadis Inc.

In 2013, Imperial opened a new global headquarters in Bristol.

In April 2014, Imperial announced the closure of its long-running Horizon factory in Nottingham. The factory closed in 2016, marking the end of cigarette production in England.

On 15 July 2014, Reynolds American agreed to buy Greensboro, North Carolina–based Lorillard Tobacco Company, for $27.4 billion. The deal also included the sale of the Kool, Winston, Salem, and blu eCigs brands to Imperial for $7.1 billion. In November 2014, Imperial said Commonwealth-Altadis and the Lorillard operations being acquired would be called ITG Brands LLC. The deal with Lorillard was completed on 12 June 2015, and as part of the deal, Greensboro became the location of the ITG headquarters. On 1 November 2018, ITG announced production would move from the former American Tobacco Company plant in Reidsville, North Carolina, built in 1892, and later expanded, to Greensboro by 2020. The plant made USA Gold, Sonoma, Montclair and Rave.
In February 2016, Imperial changed its name to &quot;Imperial Brands&quot; to distance itself from tobacco.

In 2018, a subsidiary, Imperial Brands Ventures, took a stake in Oxford Cannabinoid Technologies which is licensed by the UK government to develop cannabis-based medicines.

In November 2019, after searching for a new chairman since February, the company announced its senior independent director Thérèse Esperdy would take the role.

In July 2020, Stefan Bomhard, the former chief executive of global automotive distributor Inchcape and former president of Bacardi Europe, became chief executive of Imperial Brands.

In 2021, Imperial Brands opened an office in Hammersmith, West London. In 2021 Imperial Brands launched the Pulze and iD heated tobacco system in selected European markets. The company has also launched Zone X, an oral nicotine brand, in several European countries.

In 2022 and 2023, Imperial Brands launched blu 2.0, an upgrade to its blu vaping device, in the UK and several other countries.

<text>Omoikane (思兼 or 思金) is a Shinto Kami of wisdom and intelligence. His name means &quot;having the wisdom and thoughtfulness of many people&quot;. A heavenly deity who is called upon to &quot;ponder&quot; and give good counsel in the deliberations of the heavenly deities. In the myth where Amaterasu hid in a cave, he was entrusted with the task of finding a way to get her out. Carpenters pray to him during the construction of pillars in a building. Usually, Japanese people pray to Omoikane for success in school and exams.

He is known by other names as &quot;Tokoyo-no-Omoikane&quot; (常世思金神) in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; (古事記); &quot;Omoikane&quot; (思兼神) in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (日本書紀); &quot;Omokane&quot; (思金神, 思兼神), &quot;Tokoyo-no-Omoikane&quot; (常世思金神), &quot;Yagokoro-omoikane&quot; (八意思兼神, 八意思金神) in the &quot;Kujiki&quot; (旧事紀 or &quot;Sendai Kuji Hongi&quot; 先代旧事本紀), or &quot;Achihiko&quot; (阿智彦). 

He is the son of creator deity Takamimusubi (高御産巣日神) and the older brother of &quot;Takuhatachiji-hime&quot; (栲幡千千姫命, or commonly named in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;: 万幡豊秋津師比売命 &quot;Yorozuhatatoyo&#x27;akitsushi-hime&quot;), who is married to the deity &quot;Ame-no-Oshihomimi&quot; (天忍穂耳命). In the Kojiki Tenson kōrin myth, Omoikane is one of the &quot;kami&quot; who descends to earth.

However, in the &quot;Kujiki&quot; (旧事紀 or &quot;Sendai Kyuji Hongi&quot; 先代旧事本紀). Omoikane descends to Shinano Province (信濃国 &quot;Shinano-no-kuni&quot;, a former province that is now Nagano Prefecture) to become the ancestor of &quot;Shina-no-achihouri&quot; (信之阿智祝) and as in Chichibu Province (知々夫国, &quot;Chichibu no kuni&quot;), a former province in Saitama Prefecture. He then becomes the father of both deities, &quot;Ame-no-Uwaharu&quot; (天表春命) and &quot;Ame-no-Shitaharu&quot; (天下春命), also through this lineage becomes the patriarchal ancestor of the children of &quot;Ama-no-Koyane&quot; (天児屋命, 天児屋根命).

<doc id="655874" wikidata="Q1652352" url="?curid=655874" title="Long barrow">
<text>Long barrows are a style of monument constructed across Western Europe in the fifth and fourth millennia BCE, during the Early Neolithic period. Typically constructed from earth and either timber or stone, those using the latter material represent the oldest widespread tradition of stone construction in the world. Around 40,000 long barrows survive today.

The structures have a long earthen tumulus, or &quot;barrow&quot;, that is flanked on two sides with linear ditches. These typically stretch for between 20 and 70 metres in length, although some exceptional examples are either longer or shorter than this. Some examples have a timber or stone chamber in one end of the tumulus. These monuments often contained human remains interred within their chambers, and as a result, are often interpreted as tombs, although there are some examples where this appears not to be the case. The choice of timber or stone may have arisen from the availability of local materials rather than cultural differences. Those that contained chambers inside of them are often termed chambered long barrows while those which lack chambers are instead called unchambered long barrows or earthen long barrows.

The earliest examples developed in Iberia and western France during the mid-fifth millennium BCE. The tradition then spread northwards, into the British Isles and then the Low Countries and southern Scandinavia. Each area developed its own variations of the long barrow tradition, often exhibiting their own architectural innovations.
The purpose and meaning of the barrows remains an issue of debate among archaeologists. One argument is that they are religious sites, perhaps erected as part of a system of ancestor veneration or as a religion spread by missionaries or settlers. An alternative explanation views them primarily in economic terms, as territorial markers delineating the areas controlled by different communities as they transitioned toward farming.

Communities continued to use these long barrows long after their construction. In both the Roman period and the Early Middle Ages, many long barrows were reused as cemeteries. Since the sixteenth century they have attracted interest from antiquarians and archaeologists; it is from the excavations of the latter that our knowledge about them derives. Some have been reconstructed and have become tourist attractions or sacred sites used for rituals by modern Pagan and other religious groups.

==Terminology and definition==
Given their dispersal across Western Europe, long barrows have been given different names in the various different languages of this region. 
The term &quot;barrow&quot; is a southern English dialect word for an earthen tumulus, and was adopted as a scholarly term for such monuments by the 17th-century English antiquarian John Aubrey. Synonyms found in other parts of Britain included &quot;low&quot; in Cheshire, Staffordshire, and Derbyshire, &quot;tump&quot; in Gloucestershire and Hereford, &quot;howe&quot; in Northern England and Scotland, and &quot;cairn&quot; in Scotland.
Another term to have achieved international usage has been &quot;dolmen&quot;, a Breton word meaning &quot;table-stone&quot;; this is typically used in reference to the stone chambers found in some, although not all, long barrows.

The historian Ronald Hutton suggested that such sites could also be termed &quot;tomb-shrines&quot; to reflect the fact that they appear to have often been used both to house the remains of the dead and to have been used in ritual activities. Some contain no burials while others have been found to contain the remains of up to fifty people.

===Chambered and earthen===

Early 20th-century archaeologists began to call these monuments &quot;chambered tombs&quot;. The archaeologists Roy and Lesley Adkins referred to these monuments as &quot;megalithic long barrows&quot;. In most cases, local stone was used where it was available. The decision as to whether a long barrow used wood or stone appears to have been based largely on the availability of resources.

The style of the chamber falls into two categories. One form, known as &quot;grottes sepulchrales artificielles&quot; in French archaeology, are dug into the earth. The second form, which is more widespread, are known as &quot;cryptes dolmeniques&quot; in French archaeology and involved the chamber being erected above ground. Many chambered long barrows contained side chambers within them, often producing a cruciform shape. Others had no such side alcoves; these are known as &quot;undifferentiated tombs&quot;.

Some long barrows do not contain chambers inside of them. John Thurnham termed these &quot;unchambered&quot; barrows, while the archaeologist Stuart Piggott favoured the term &quot;earthen&quot; barrows for them. Ian Kinnes instead used the term &quot;non-megalithic barrows&quot;. These long barrows might have used timber because stone was not available. Some classificatory systems, such as that employed by the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Monuments Record, do not distinguish between the different types of long barrow.

The archaeologist David Field noted that drawing typological distinctions on the basis of material used can mask important similarities between different long barrows. Also criticising the focus on classification, the archaeologists Lewis-Williams and Pearce believed that doing so distracted scholars from the task of explaining the meaning and purpose behind the monuments.

===Design and architecture===

Long barrows are single mounds, usually of earth, which are flanked by ditches. They are usually between 20 and 70 metres in length, although there are some exceptional examples at either end of this spectrum.

The construction of long barrows in the Early Neolithic would have required the co-operation of a number of different individuals and would have represented an important investment in time and resources. They were built without the use of metal tools.

There is often regional variation in style and material. In the north and west of Britain, for instance, long barrows often consist of stone mounds containing chambers inside of them, whereas in the south and east of Britain these long barrows are typically made of earth.

Many were altered and restyled over their long period of use.
Ascertaining at what date a long barrow was constructed is difficult for archaeologists as a result of the various modifications that were made to the monument during the Early Neolithic. Similarly, both modifications and later damage can make it difficult to determine the nature of the original long barrow design.

Architecturally, there is much overlap between long barrows and other monument types from Neolithic Europe, such as the bank barrows, cursus monuments, long cairns, and mortuary enclosures. Bank barrows are stylistically similar to the long barrows but are considerably longer. Cursus monuments also exhibit parallel ditches, but also extend over much longer distances than the long barrows.

Enviro-archaeological studies have demonstrated that many of the long barrows were erected in wooded landscapes. In Britain, these chambered long barrows are typically located on prominent hills and slopes, in particular being located above rivers and inlets and overlooking valleys. In Britain, long barrows were also often constructed near to causewayed enclosures, a form of earthen monument.

==Distribution and chronology==

Across Europe, about 40,000 long barrows are known to survive from the Early Neolithic. They are found across much of Western Europe; stretching from southeast Spain up to southern Sweden and taking in the British Isles to the west. The long barrows are not the world&#x27;s oldest known structures using stone—they are predated by Göbekli Tepe in modern Turkey—but they do represent the oldest widespread tradition of using stone in construction. The archaeologist Frances Lynch has described them as &quot;the oldest built structures in Europe&quot; to survive, while Field noted that they are the earliest monuments surviving in Britain. Although found across this large area, they can be subdivided into clear regionalised traditions based on architectural differences.

Excavation has revealed that some of the long barrows in the area of modern Spain, Portugal, and western France were erected in the mid-fifth millennium BCE, making these older than those long barrows further north. Although the general area in which the oldest long barrows were built is therefore known, archaeologists do not know exactly where the tradition started nor which long barrows are the very first ones to have been built. It therefore appears that the architectural tradition developed in this southern area of Western Europe before spreading north, along the Atlantic coast. The tradition had reached Britain by the first half of the fourth millennium BCE, either soon after farming or in some cases perhaps just before it.
It later spread further north on mainland Europe, for instance arriving in the Netherlands in the second half of the fourth millennium BCE.

Later in the Neolithic, burial practices tended to place greater emphasis on the individual, suggesting a growing social hierarchy and a move away from collective burial.
One of the last chambered tombs erected was Bryn Celli Ddu in Anglesey, Wales, built long after people stopped building them across most of Western Europe. The conscious anachronism of the monument led excavators to suggest that its construction was part of a deliberate attempt by people to restore older religious practices that were extinct elsewhere.

Hutton suggested that this tradition &quot;defines the Early Neolithic of Western Europe&quot; more than any other, while the archaeologist David Field described them as &quot;among the best known and easily recognised archaeological monuments in the [British] landscape.&quot; For the archaeologist Caroline Malone, the long barrows are &quot;some of the most impressive and aesthetically distinctive constructions of prehistoric Britain&quot;. Her fellow archaeologist Frances Lynch stated that these long barrows &quot;can still inspire awe, wonder and curiosity even in modern populations familiar with Gothic cathedrals and towering skyscrapers.&quot;

===Regional variation===
In the area of southern Spain, Portugal, southwestern France, and Brittany, the long barrows typically include large stone chambers.

In Britain, earthen long barrows predominate across much of the southern and eastern parts of the island.
Around 300 earthen long barrows are known from across the eastern side of Britain, from Aberdeenshire in the north down to the South Downs in the south, with two projections westward into Dorset and Galloway. Excavation has suggested that these earthen long barrows were likely constructed between 3800 and 3000 BCE.

Another prominent regional tradition in Britain is the Cotswold-Severn Group found in the west of the island. These are typically chambered long barrows, and contained human bone in comparatively large quantities, averaging between 40 and 50 people in each.

The long barrows found in the Netherlands and northern Germany also used stone in their construction where it was available.
The examples of long barrows found in parts of Poland are also typically earthen rather than megalithic.
Further north, in Denmark and southern Sweden, the long barrows typically used stone in their construction.

== Function ==

The purpose and meaning of Early Neolithic long barrows are not known, though archaeologists can make suggestions on the basis of recurring patterns that can be observed within the tradition. Archaeologists have not, however, agreed upon the most likely meaning and purpose of these monuments, with various different interpretations being put forward. Lynch suggested that the long barrows likely had &quot;broad religious and social roles&quot; for the communities who built and used them, comparing them in this way to the churches of medieval and modern Europe.

===Funerary spaces===
Many of the long barrows were used as tombs in which to place the remains of deceased individuals. For this reason, archaeologists like Malone have referred to them as &quot;houses of the dead&quot;. Conversely, many of the long barrows do not appear to have been used as tombs; various examples that have been excavated by archaeologists have shown no evidence of having had human remains deposited there. The archaeologists David Lewis-Williams and David Peace, however, noted that these long barrows were more than tombs, also being &quot;religious and social foci&quot;, suggesting that they were places where the dead were visited by the living and where people maintained relationships with the deceased.

In some cases, the bones deposited in the chamber may have been old when placed there. In other instances, they may have been placed into the chamber long after the long barrow was built. In some instances, collections of bone originally included in the chamber might have been removed and replaced during the Early Neolithic itself.

The human remains placed in long barrows often included a mix of men, women, and children. 
The bones of various individuals were often mixed together. This may have reflected a desire to obliterate distinctions of wealth and status among the deceased.
Not all of those who died in the Early Neolithic were buried in these long barrows, although it remains unknown what criteria were used to determine whose remains were interred there and whose were not.
Large sections of the Early Neolithic population were not buried in them, although how their bodily remains are dealt with is not clear. It is possible that they were left in the open air.

It is also not known where the act of excarnation took place prior to the deposition of bones within the chambers. Some human bones have been found in the ditches of causewayed enclosures, a form of Early Neolithic earthen monument, while evidence for the Early Neolithic outdoor exposure of corpses has also been found at Hambledon Hill. The postholes found in front of many long barrows may also have represented the bases of platforms on which excarnation took place.

When entering the chambers to either add or remove new material, individuals would likely have been exposed to the smell of decaying corpses. It is unknown if entering this area was therefore seen by Early Neolithic Europeans as an ordeal to be overcome or an honourable job to be selected for.

In some chambers, human remains were arranged and organised according to the type of bone or the age and sex of the individual that they came from, factors that determined which chamber they were placed in.
Lynch noted that &quot;the bulk of our surviving evidence suggests that collectivity became and remained the norm until the late neolithic&quot;.

Comparatively rarely, grave goods have been found interred alongside human bone inside the long barrows. Where these have been found, archaeologists have typically interpreted them as the remains of funerary ceremonies or of feasts. The choice of grave goods included reflects regional variation. In the Cotswold-Severn Group in southwestern England, cattle bones were commonly found within the chambers, where they had often been treated in a manner akin to the human remains.

Sometimes human remains were deposited in the chambers over many centuries. For instance, at West Kennet Long Barrow in Wiltshire, southern England, the earliest depositions of human remains were radiocarbon dated to the early-to-mid fourth millennium BCE, while a later deposition of human remains was found to belong to the Beaker culture, thus indicating a date in the final centuries of the third millennium BCE; this meant that human remains had been placed into the chamber intermittently over a period of 1500 years.
This indicates that some chambered long barrows remained in sporadic use until the Late Neolithic.

In various cases, archaeologists have found specific bones absent from the assemblages within the chambers. For instance, at Fussell&#x27;s Lodge in Wiltshire, southern England, a number of skeletal assemblages were found to be missing not just small bones but also long bones and skulls. It is therefore possible that some bones were deliberately removed from the chambers in the Early Neolithic for use in ritualistic activities.

===Origins of the design===

The source of inspiration for the design of the chambered long barrows remains unclear. Suggestions that have proved popular among archaeologists is that they were inspired either by natural rock formations or by the shape of wooden houses. It has been suggested that their design was based on the wooden long houses found in central Europe during the Early Neolithic, however there is a gap of seven centuries between the last known long houses and the first known chambered long barrows.

===Religious sites===

According to one possible explanation, the long barrows served as markers of place that were connected to Early Neolithic ideas about cosmology and spirituality, and accordingly were centres of ritual activity mediated by the dead. The inclusion of human remains has been used to argue that these long barrows were involved in a form of ancestor veneration. Malone suggested that the prominence of these barrows suggested that ancestors were deemed far more important to Early Neolithic people than their Mesolithic forebears. In the early twentieth century, this interpretation of the long barrows as religious sites was often connected to the idea that they were the holy sites of a new religion spread by either settlers or missionaries. This explanation has been less popular with archaeologists since the 1970s.

Adopting an approach based in cognitive archaeology, Lewis-Williams and Pearce argued that the chambered long barrows &quot;reflected and at the same time constituted... a culturally specific expression of the neurologically generated tiered cosmos&quot;, a cosmos mediated by a system of symbols. They suggested that the entrances to the chambers were viewed as transitional zones where sacrificial rituals took place, and that they were possibly spaces for the transformation of the dead using fire.

===Territorial markers===

A second explanation is that these long barrows were intrinsically connected to the transition to farming, representing a new way of looking at the land. In this interpretation, the long barrows served as territorial markers, dividing up the land, signifying that it was occupied and controlled by a particular community, and thus warning away rival groups. In defending this interpretation, Malone noted that each &quot;tomb-territory&quot; typically had access to a range of soils and landscape types in its vicinity, suggesting that it could have represented a viable territorial area for a particular community. Also supporting this interpretation is the fact that the distribution of chambered long barrows on some Scottish islands shows patterns that closely mirror modern land divisions between farms and crofts. This interpretation also draws ethnographic parallels from recorded communities around the world, who have also used monuments to demarcate territory.

This idea became popular among archaeologists in the 1980s and 1990s, and—in downplaying religion while emphasising an economic explanation for these monuments—it was influenced by Marxist ideas then popular in the European archaeological establishment. In the early twenty-first century, archaeologists began to challenge this idea, as evidence emerged that much of Early Neolithic Britain was forested and its inhabitants were likely pastoralists rather than agriculturalists. Accordingly, communities in Britain would have been semi-nomadic, with little need for territorial demarcation or clear markings of land ownership. Also, this explanation fails to explain why the chambered long barrows should be clustered in certain areas rather than being evenly distributed throughout the landscape.

==Later history==

Many of the chambered long barrows have not remained intact, having been damaged and broken up during the millennia. In some cases, most of the chamber has been removed, leaving only the three-stone dolmen.

===Iron Age and Roman use===

During the first half of the first millennium BCE, many British long barrows saw renewed human activity. At Julliberrie&#x27;s Grave in Kent, southeast England, three inhumations were buried at the southern edge of the ditch around the long barrow. The barrow at Wayland&#x27;s Smithy in Oxfordshire, also in southeast England, saw a cemetery established around the long barrow, with at least 46 skeletons buried in 42 graves, many having been decapitated. 17 Romano-British burials were discovered at Wor Barrow in Dorset, eight of which were missing their heads.

The deposition of coins around long barrows also appears to have been quite common in Roman Britain, and these may have been placed by these monuments as offerings. A hoard of Constantinian coins was for instance placed in a pot around Julliberrie&#x27;s Grave. A solitary coin from the reign of Allectus was found in the ditch around the long barrow at Skendleby I.

===Antiquarian and archaeological investigation===

The first serious study of chambered long barrows took place in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the mounds that covered chambers were removed by agriculture.
By the nineteenth century, antiquarians and archaeologists had come to recognise this style of monument as a form of tomb. In the latter nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, archaeologists like V. Gordon Childe held to the cultural diffusionist view that such Western European monuments had been based on tombs originally produced in parts of the eastern Mediterranean region, suggesting that their ultimate origin was either in Egypt or in Crete. In this view, the tradition was seen as having spread westward as part of some form of &quot;megalithic religion&quot;.

A seminal study of the long barrows authored by the Welsh archaeologist Glyn Daniel was published in 1958 as &quot;The Megalith Builders of Western Europe&quot;.
In 1950, Daniel stated that about a tenth of known chambered long barrows in Britain had been excavated, while regional field studies helped to list them.
Few of the earlier excavations recorded or retained any human remains found in the chamber.
From the 1960s onward, archaeological research increasingly focused on examining regional groups of long barrows rather than the wider architectural tradition. From this decade onward, the meticulous excavation of various long barrows also led to the widespread recognition that long barrows were often multi-phase monuments which had been changed over time.

Up until the 1970s, archaeologists widely believed that the long barrows of Western Europe were based on Near Eastern models.

Archaeological investigation of long barrows has been hindered by the misidentification of other features. Long barrows have been confused with coniger mounds and rabbit warrens, sometimes termed pillow mounds, which can take on a similar shape. Rifle butts can also sometimes take on shapes similar to those of long barrows. Later landscaping has also led to misidentification; the two mounds at Stoke Park in Bristol, southwest England were for instance thought to be long barrows until an excavation in the 1950s revealed that they post-dated the Middle Ages, and thus must have been created by more recent landscaping projects. In areas which were previously impacted by glaciation, moraine deposits on valley floors have sometimes been mistaken for long barrows. At Dunham New Park in Cheshire, northwest England, for instance, a mound was initially believed to be a long barrow and only later assessed as a natural feature. Damage sustained by Neolithic long barrows can also lead to them being mistaken for other types of monuments, such as the oval barrows and round barrows which are usually of later date.

Aerial photography has proven useful in identifying many more examples that are barely visible on the ground. Geophysical surveys have been found to be helpful to explore sites that are unavailable for excavation.

===Recent activity ===

Long barrows such as West Kennet Long Barrow in Wiltshire have become tourist attractions. At Wayland&#x27;s Smithy in Oxfordshire, visitors have lodged coins into cracks in the site&#x27;s stones since at least the 1960s, while at the Coldrum Long Barrow in Kent, a rag tree has been established overhanging the barrow.

Many modern Pagans view West Kennet Long Barrow as a &quot;temple&quot; and use it for their rituals. Some see it as a place of the ancestors where they can engage in &quot;vision quests&quot; and other neo-shamanic practices. Others have seen it as a womb of the Great Goddess, and as a sort of living entity. The winter solstice has been a particularly popular occasion for Pagans to visit.

In 2015 the first long barrow in thousands of years, the Long Barrow at All Cannings, inspired by those built in the Neolithic era, was built on land just outside the village of All Cannings in Wiltshire. This was followed soon after by others, such as Soulton Long Barrow near Wem, Shropshire.&#x27;

<text>This is a list of drowning victims in chronological order. The reasons for drowning are diverse and range from suicide, to accidents or murders.

== Antiquity ==
*Tiberinus Silvius, ninth Latin king of Alba Longa, drowned in the Tiber, which was named after him.
*Hippasus of Metapontum, a student of the mathematician Pythagoras, who, by some accounts, was drowned by his fellow Pythagoreans for the imprudence of discovering irrational numbers.
*Qu Yuan of China in 278 BC. Committed ritual suicide as a form of protest against the corruption of the era, a sacrifice still commemorated today during the Duan Wu or Dragon Boat Festival.
*Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII of Egypt, drowned in the Nile in 47 BC.
*Antinous (born &quot;circa&quot; 111), lover of Roman Emperor Hadrian, drowned in the Nile in 130; the grieving emperor commissioned hundreds of statues of the youth and spread them around the Empire.
*Cao E, a Han dynasty girl venerated for her filial piety. In 143, Cao Xu accidentally fell into the Shun River. in an act of filial piety, she decided to find her father in the river. After five days, she and her father were both found dead in the river from drowning. Eight years later, a temple was built in Shangyu dedicated to the memory of Cao E and her sacrifice for filial piety. The Shun River was renamed Cao&#x27;e River in her honor.
*Maxentius, Roman Emperor, drowned in the Tiber during the chaos of the Battle of the Milvian Bridge on October 28, 312.
*Yuan Zhao, briefly an emperor of the Northern Wei, thrown together with Empress Dowager Hu into the Yellow River to drown
*Shabib ibn Yazid al-Shaybani, (697/98), a rebel in Umayyad Caliphate, was defeated by Umayyad Army. As he attempted to escape his Syrian pursuers (the Umayyad army), he drowned in the Dujayl Canal while trying to cross it. This occurred either in early 697 or in 697/98.
*Li Bai, Chinese poet, in 762. It is, however, suggested that he died of excessive drinking or mercury poisoning.

== Middle Ages ==
*William Adelin (born 1103) and his half-sister Matilda FitzEdith, countess of Perches (born &quot;circa&quot; 1090), children of King Henry I of England, drowned in the Channel on 25 November 1120 in the &quot;White Ship&quot; wreck.
*Kilij Arslan died trying to escape across the Khabur river, having lost the battle that took place near the river.
* Empress Zhu is believed to have committed suicide by drowning herself in 1127 after the Jingkang Incident because she was a victim of sexual abuse.
* Taira no Koremori is believed to have committed suicide on May 10, 1184, after defeated at the Battle of Kurikara.
*Emperor Antoku, Taira no Tokiko, Tomomori, Noritsune and many other members of the Taira clan committed suicide on April 25, 1185, after defeated at the Battle of Dan-no-ura.
*Friedrich I Barbarossa, Duke of Swabia and Holy Roman Emperor, drowned in the Göksu River (Cilicia) on 6 June 1190 during the Third Crusade, leaving an unstable alliance between Richard I of England and Philip II of France.
*Henry of Antioch, the son of Bohemund IV of Antioch, drowned at sea in June 1276.

<text>Richard John Sinclair Laws CBE (born 8 August 1935) is a retired Australian radio announcer who had a broadcasting career that spanned 71 years. His distinctive voice earned him the nickname &quot;Golden Tonsils&quot;.

==Career==

Best known as a talkback radio broadcaster, Laws was one of Australia&#x27;s highest-paid radio personalities and was involved with Australian talkback radio broadcasting much longer than any other presenter. Although regularly commentating on topical news, Laws did not regard himself a journalist but as an entertainer and salesman. He was nonetheless one of the few commercial radio personalities whose interviews with state and federal political leaders are considered to have a significant influence on the course of politics in New South Wales especially, and Australia in general. He has also often appeared as a television show host and enjoyed a long recording career.

Laws&#x27; radio show was syndicated throughout Australia for many years and was consistently one of the most popular and influential programs in the Australian media. Laws is also a familiar voice for generations of Australians through his large and varied body of work as a voice-over artist for commercials, and as a celebrity endorser of commercial products, notably Valvoline motor oil, with his popular catchphrase &quot;Valvoline, you know what I mean&quot; and Oral-B toothbrushes (the slogan &quot;Oral-B, the toothbrush more dentists use&quot;).
== Biography ==

===Early life===

Born in Wau, Papua New Guinea, on 8 August 1935, to Australian parents, Laws contracted polio twice – once as a child, and again as a young man. He was educated at Mosman Preparatory School and Knox Grammar School in Sydney.

=== Early career===

He began his radio career in 1953 at 3BO in Bendigo before working at several rural radio stations and joining 2UE in 1957, the first of four terms at the Sydney radio station, during which time he became one of the first Australian disc jockeys to play rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music (along with Bob Rogers, Tony Withers and Stan Rofe). Laws pioneered the practice (soon taken up by Rofe) of using contacts in the airline industry to supply him with the latest international pop releases, giving him an edge at a time when Australian releases of many British and American pop records might be delayed for months.

Laws left 2UE in 1959, and moved to the Hunter Valley, where he ran a farm. In 1962, he moved back to Sydney, where he joined 2GB, remaining with the station for two years before he rejoined 2UE in 1964. His stint at 2UE continued until 1969, at which point he contracted to 2UW, where he was to remain for almost 10 years. He returned to 2UE in 1979, this time for another five years. He then moved to 2GB after a highly publicized bid for his services, but returned to the 2UE fold when the station was number eight in the ratings. The return of Laws was the primary cause of the station becoming number one in Sydney for many years. Laws&#x27; radio program was syndicated nationwide, and was especially popular in rural areas. Capital city stations taking Laws included 4BC in Brisbane, 2CC in Canberra, 7HOFM in Hobart and Mix 104.9 in Darwin.

In 1983, Communications lecturer Glen Lewis wrote of Laws:

He sets the agenda by complaining vigorously about something, lays down the line for the day, then accepts calls which mostly reflect his own viewpoint... he mostly gets the restatement of cliched views [from callers]... Technically, he foregrounds minority group negative stereotyping in his show. Informally, he specialises in moral crusades against the unrespectable weak – the unemployed, prisoners, homosexuals, anti-nuclear demonstrators – in the name of the upright citizen and honest taxpayer.
===Television===

Though best known as a radio host, Laws has often worked as a television host and panelist. His early 1960s show &quot;Startime&quot; assisted in introducing mainstream Australia to Dame Edna Everage at which time Laws claimed Everage was &quot;a very close friend of mine&quot;. Laws told columnist Valda Marshall in 1970 that he was &#x27;not basically a TV star&#x27; and didn&#x27;t &#x27;feel altogether happy with the medium&#x27;. He was a judge on &quot;Australia&#x27;s New Faces&quot; in 1969 and took over as host from Noel Ferrier on the panel advice show &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in 1970. He also appeared on television in 1970 in an acting role in the children&#x27;s drama &quot;Skippy&quot;. Laws quit &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in 1971; a spokesman for the station which produced the show, Channel 7, claimed Laws had asked for a higher salary. In May 1971, he began hosting a daytime show called &quot;His and Hers&quot;. In 1982, he hosted a revived &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; for Network 10. In 1998, &quot;John Laws – In One Lifetime&quot; premiered on Network Ten and &quot;LAWS&quot; on Foxtel. While &quot;LAWS&quot; continued until 2000, &quot;John Laws – In One Lifetime&quot; was dropped after two episodes, although the remaining five episodes that were commissioned by Network 10 were aired later that year.

===21st century and retirements===

In 2002, station colleague and arch-rival Alan Jones moved from 2UE to 2GB, and soon took that station to the top talk position in Sydney. Laws announced on 25 June 2007 that after 55 years on the air he would retire at the end of the year. However, he was pre-empted by other media agencies, who broke the story at 9:00 am. Laws made the announcement at about 9:10 am, saying that he had planned to make the announcement at about 9:45 am. Laws&#x27; last broadcast was on 30 November 2007, one week after the federal election. He began as always, &quot;Hello world, I&#x27;m John Laws&quot; and signed off with his usual quote, &quot;you...be kind to each other.&quot; He then left the 2UE building in Sydney in his Rolls-Royce Phantom surrounded by hordes of cameramen.

In 2004, Laws and rival talk-back host Alan Jones were accused of taking payment to make favourable comments on products and services under the guise of merely expressing personal opinion, after entering into deals with Telstra. The ABA subsequently found that Laws&#x27; deal constituted cash for comment but Jones&#x27; did not. Laws, apparently angered by what he saw as inequitable treatment, launched stinging attacks on Jones and the ABA&#x27;s head, David Flint. In an appearance on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Enough Rope&quot;, Laws accused Jones of placing pressure on Prime Minister John Howard to keep Flint as head of the ABA, and made comments that many viewers took to imply a sexual relationship between Jones and Flint, and broadly hinted that Jones, like Flint, was homosexual.

In November 2004, Laws and 2UE colleague Steve Price were found guilty of vilifying homosexuals after an on-air discussion about a gay couple appearing in the reality TV show &quot;The Block&quot;. They described the couple as &quot;young poofs&quot;. Laws had previously apologised for another incident in which he called gay TV personality Carson Kressley, of &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; fame, a &quot;pillow-biter&quot; and a &quot;pompous little pansy prig&quot;.

On 17 July 2007, Laws&#x27; gold-plated microphone was stolen. The Sennheiser was presented to him by his radio station 2UE management in 2003 to commemorate his 50 years on the air and was said to be worth $10,000. &quot;I&#x27;m very upset about it – it&#x27;s been a part of my life&quot; he told the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. Laws subsequently switched to another gold plated microphone; a Rode NT2-A presented to him for his 40th anniversary. He promised charges would not be laid if the Sennheiser was returned.

In October 2007, West Coast Eagles player Adam Selwood commenced legal proceedings against Laws over comments made about him regarding a mid-year incident involving Fremantle Football Club player Des Headland.

In December 2007, during a long lunch at Sydney&#x27;s Otto Ristorante to farewell his former personal assistant, Laws was informed of the presence of rival broadcasters Derryn Hinch and Bob Rogers at another table nearby. He went over to their table and immediately spouted forth a tirade of invective, calling them &#x27;the two most despicable cunts&#x27; he&#x27;d ever met in the industry. Hinch and Rogers traded insults with Laws, insisting Hinch was a &#x27;hypocrite&#x27; and a &#x27;failed alcoholic&#x27;. Hinch replied that that must mean Laws was a &#x27;successful one&#x27; and that if Laws was not in fact an alcoholic then he was a &#x27;bloody good actor&#x27;. Eventually 2UE colleague Mike Carlton convinced Laws to return to his table and Hinch and Rogers were left to laugh off the altercation.

On 7 May 2009, Laws made a statement on the 20th anniversary special edition of the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot; program, in which he exhibited no remorse for his role in the Cash-for-Comment scandal, instead implying that the whistleblower (&quot;Media Watch&quot;) was the wrongdoer and that the people involved were only jealous of his success.

In August 2009, Laws revealed on Vega that he missed radio and that he was interested in returning to the airwaves. This was followed five months later by an announcement by Laws&#x27; manager, revealing that Laws had entered into negotiations with a number of radio stations, including 2SM. Nevertheless, the suggestions that Laws would be returning from retirement in 2010 ended shortly thereafter, when 2UE management revealed that their contract with Laws precluded him from competing with their station until December 2010. Laws&#x27; management confirmed in November 2010 that he would be returning to radio, following the expiry of the no-compete clause that prevented him from signing with a new network. On 31 January 2011, Laws debuted in the morning slot on 2SM, presenting the John Laws Morning Show on that station and networked to the Super Radio Network.

On 19 March 2013, Laws interviewed a female listener, who described a history of sexual abuse between the ages of six and sixteen. Laws proceeded to ask the woman if the abuse was in some way her fault and whether she had been provocative. The following day Laws said on air that women who dressed provocatively were once viewed as &quot;rape bait&quot;.

In 2015, Laws referred to a male victim of child sexual assault as a &quot;wet blanket&quot; and told him to &quot;brighten up&quot;.

In March 2020, Laws addressed on air an email received from a listener which was critical of both Laws and various items of content broadcast on the show. In his response, Laws told the listener &quot;for goodness sake, say something constructive, like you&#x27;re going to kill yourself.&quot; The incident was later investigated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, who in March 2021 released a report finding Laws had breached two provisions of the Commercial Radio Code of Practice in broadcasting this statement. It also found 2HD (licensee of 2SM) had breached a provision of the same code relating to complaints handling.

Laws announced on 8 October 2024 during a listener message, that after 71 years on the air, and 13 years with 2SM, he would retire from radio on 8 November 2024, for the final time.

== Cultural influence ==

In 1996, a portrait of John Laws by artist Paul Newton won the Packing Room award at the Archibald Prize. The portrait was hung in Laws&#x27; production office at 2UE.

Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating called him the &quot;broadcaster of the century&quot; at Laws 40th anniversary dinner. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008 he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award.

He is mentioned in the song &quot;Who Can Stand in the Way?&quot; by Australian group Midnight Oil on their album &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot; and the song &quot;This Train Will be Taking No Passengers&quot; from Augie March&#x27;s second album Strange Bird. and the song Crooks and Crimescenes by Inner-west Sydney rap group Spit Syndicate.

==Poetry and non-fiction ==

Laws has authored numerous books, many of them poetry collections. He claimed in 1970 that he had been reading Rod McKuen&#x27;s poems on air but at one point, realising he had left his copy of McKuen&#x27;s book at home, he instead read a poem of his own and &quot;it seemed to go over pretty well.&quot; The working title for his first book was &quot;Poems that Came to Me in the Night When No-one Else Would.&quot; His &quot;Book of Irreverent Logic&quot; and his &quot;Book of Uncommon Sense&quot; were republished together in 1996 as &quot;A John Laws Limited Edition&quot;. His most recent work is a memoir. His books include:

* &quot;In love is an expensive place to die : poems&quot; (Paul Hamlyn, 1971)
* &quot;Results of Love&quot; (Hamlyn, 1972)
* &quot;Calendar Collection&quot; (Summit, 1978)
* &quot;Just You and Me Together, Love: Poems&quot; (Hamlyn, 1978)

<doc id="655883" wikidata="Q1247911" url="?curid=655883" title="Dafne">
<text>Dafne is the earliest known work that, by modern standards, could be considered an opera. The libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini, based on an earlier intermedio created in 1589, &quot;Combattimento di Apollo col serpente Pitone,&quot; and set to music by Luca Marenzio, survives complete. The opera is considered to be the first &quot;modern music drama.&quot;

The mostly lost music was completed by Jacopo Peri, but at least two of the six surviving fragments are by Jacopo Corsi. &quot;Dafne&quot; was first performed during Carnival of 1598 (1597 old style) at the Palazzo Corsi.

==History==
Most of Peri&#x27;s music has been lost, despite its popularity and fame in Europe at the time of its composition, but the 455-line verse libretto was published and survives. Florence&#x27;s ruling Medici family was sufficiently taken with &quot;Dafne&quot; to allow Peri&#x27;s next work, &quot;Euridice&quot;, to be performed as part of Marie de&#x27; Medici and Henry IV&#x27;s wedding celebrations in 1600.

The opera was written for an elite circle of humanists in Florence, the Florentine Camerata, between 1594 and 1597, with the support, and possibly the collaboration, of the composer and patron Jacopo Corsi. However, the first confirmed, non-public, performance of the work for Don Giovanni de&#x27; Medici was held in 1597 thanks to Marco da Gagliano. On Peri&#x27;s own account, the opera seems to have been performed during three carnival celebrations (1595–1598), with the opera having been composed the year prior. The opera was later performed in 1599 at the Palazzo Pitti and at the Palazzo Guicciardini Corsi Salviati no later than January of the same year, but dates of performances are under scholastic debate.

As an attempt to revive Greek drama, it was a long way off from what the ancient Greeks would have recognized as dramatic art.

== Story ==
The opera&#x27;s story regarding Apollo falling in love with the eponymous nymph, Daphne, takes its inspiration from Ovid and his narrative poetry, &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; a work in wide usage within the operas composed within the Florentine, Mantuan, and Roman operatic spheres.

According to Rinunccini&#x27;s libretto, Apollo saves mankind by shooting Python, and soon pushes Cupid into an archery contest to see who&#x27;s the better shot. As a way to get back at him, Cupid shoots him and makes him fall in love with Daphne. In order to get away from Apollo, Daphne turns into a laurel tree which Apollo then makes a crown of, this becoming the symbol of poetry, music, and freedom.

== Music ==
&quot;Dafne&quot; is scored for a much smaller ensemble than Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s slightly later operas, namely, a harpsichord, a lute, a viol, an archlute, and a triple flute. Drawing on a new development at the time, Peri established recitatives, melodic speech set to music, as a central part of opera.

Peri&#x27;s musical language was a conglomeration of his contemporaries and the experimentation with the invocation of human speech in music through recitative and musical prosody. For Peri, he strove to replicate the flow and musicality of speech in his writing, while contemporaries Emilio de&#x27; Cavalieri and Giulio Caccini sought different but similar compositional goals. As a result, the music written for the opera may have been co-written with help from Caccini but contemporary research does not support this.

<text>Mayday was an electronic music festival in Germany, where it began in 1991, and in Katowice in southern Poland where it debuted in 2000. Despite the name, Mayday festivals date oscillates between April and December (these being called Winter Mayday). 

Now the festival is only held around 30 April in Dortmund, Germany northeast of Düsseldorf and 10 November in Katowice. Each Mayday has a theme. Until 2013 it was composed by Members of Mayday, DJs WestBam, and Klaus Jankuhn. Since 1998 Mayday (Germany) is supported by eve&amp;rave Münster e.V. with drug information desks. Although it played techno music in its early days, in recent years Mayday has opened up to new sounds, from hardstyle to house, trance and EDM.

<text>Indian Railways is a state-owned enterprise that is organised as a deparmental undertaking of the Ministry of Railways of the Government of India and operates India&#x27;s national railway system. , it manages the fourth largest national railway system by size with a track length of , running track length of and route length of . , 96.59% of the broad-gauge network is electrified. With more than 1.2 million employees, it is the world&#x27;s ninth-largest employer and India&#x27;s second largest employer.

In 1951, the Indian Railways was established by the amalgamation of 42 different railway companies operating in the country, spanning a total of . The railway network across the country was reorganized into six regional zones in 1951–52 for administrative purposes, which was gradually expanded to 18 zones over the years.

The first steam operated railway operated in 1837 in Madras with the first passenger operating in 1853 between Bombay and Thane. In 1925, the first electric train ran in Bombay on DC traction. The first locomotive manufacturing unit was commissioned in 1950 at Chittaranjan with the first coach manufacturing unit set-up at Madras in 1955.

Indian Railways runs various classes of express, passengers and suburban trains. In 2023–4, it operated 13,198 trains on average daily covering 7,325 stations and carried 6.905 billion passengers. Indian Railways also operates different classes of rail freight transport. In 2023–4, it operated 11,724 freight trains on average daily and transported 1588.06 million tonnes of freight. Indian Railways operates multiple classes of rolling stock, manufactured by self-owned coach-production facilities. , Indian Railways&#x27; rolling stock consisted of 327,991 freight wagons, 91,948 passenger coaches (including multiple unit coaches) and 10,675 electric, 4,397 diesel and 38 steam locomotives.

== History ==
=== 1832–1899 ===
In 1832 the proposal to construct the first railway line in India at Madras was made. In 1835, a railway track was constructed between Red Hills and Chintadripet in Madras and became operational in 1837. It was hauled by a rotary steam engine imported from England and was used for ferrying granite. 
The Madras Railway was established in 1845 and the Great Indian Peninsular Railway was incorporated in 1849. Temporary railway lines were built such as the railway line at Dowleswaram built by Arthur Cotton to supply stone for the construction of a dam over the Godavari River in 1845 and the Solani aqueduct railway, built by Proby Cautley in Roorkee to transport construction materials for an aqueduct over the Solani river in 1851. In 1852, a steam locomotive imported from England was tried at Byculla. In 1853, the first passenger train on broad gauge ran for between Bombay and Thane which had 14-carriages carrying 400 people, hauled by three steam locomotives: the Sahib, Sindh and Sultan. This day is considered to be the formation date of the Indian Railways and is marked as the Indian Railways day annually.

The Thane viaducts, the first railway bridges, were built over the Thane creek when the Mumbai-Thane line was extended to Kalyan in May 1854. Eastern India&#x27;s first passenger train ran from Howrah, near Kolkata, to Hoogly on 15 August 1854. The construction of the first main line in the South between Royapuram in Madras and Arcot started in 1853, which became operational on 1 July 1856. On 24 February 1873, a horse-drawn tram opened in Calcutta between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat street. On 9 May 1874, a horse-drawn tramway began operation in Bombay between Colaba and Parel. In 1879, the Nizam&#x27;s Guaranteed State Railway was established which built railway lines across the then Hyderabad State from Kachiguda. In 1877, an Ajmer built F-1/734 Steam Locomotive became the first indigenously built locomotive in India. In 1897, lighting in passenger coaches was introduced with Jodhpur Railway, the first to introduce electric lighting as a standard fixture.

=== 1900–1999 ===

The first railway budget was presented in 1924. On 3 February 1925, the first electric train ran between Bombay and Kurla, hauled by a SLM electric locomotive on DC traction. In 1925, the first Electric Multiple Units (EMU) were introduced in Bombay with 1500 V DC units imported from Cammell Laird and Uerdingenwagonfabrik. Chennai suburban railway started operating in 1931 with a single metre-gauge line from Chennai Beach to Tambaram. In the period between 1925 and 1944, the management of the railway companies in the British presidencies and provinces was taken over by the Government.

In 1950, there were about 42 different railway companies operating about tracks across the country. These railway companies were amalgamated in steps to form a single entity named as Indian Railways. In December 1950, the Central Advisory Committee for Railways approved the plan for re-organizing Indian Railways into six regional zones with the Southern (14 April 1951), Central (5 November 1951), and Western (5 November 1951) zones being the first to be created. In 1952, fans and lights were mandated for all compartments in passenger trains and sleeping accommodations were introduced in coaches. The first diesel locomotive used in India was fabricated by North British Locomotive Company in 1954.

The first locomotive manufacturing unit at Chittaranjan was commissioned in 1950. The first rail coaches were manufactured in India from 1956 when the Integral Coach Factory was established at Madras. In 1956, the first air-conditioned train plied between Howrah and New Delhi. In 1957, Indian Railways adopted 25 kV AC traction with the first runs beginning in December 1959 with the WAM-1 locomotives. The first containerized freight rail transport began between Bombay and Ahmedabad in 1966. In 1969, the Government of India announced the introduction of a new express train capable of reaching speeds of up to in the railway budget and the first Rajdhani Express was flagged off from New Delhi to Howrah in March 1969. In 1974, Indian Railways endured a 20-day strike. The first metro rail was introduced in Calcutta on 24 October 1984.

In 1986, computerized ticketing and reservations were introduced. In 1988, the first Shatabdi Express was introduced between New Delhi and Jhansi. Two years later, the first self-printing ticket machine (SPTM) was introduced in Delhi. In 1993, air-conditioned three-tier and sleeper were introduced. In 1995, Chennai MRTS became the first operational elevated railway line in India. Centralized computer reservation system was deployed in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai in September 1996, coupon validating machines (CVMs) were introduced at Mumbai CSMT in 1998 and the nationwide concierge system began operation on 18 April 1999.

=== 2000–present ===
The Indian Railways website went online in February 2000. Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) was incorporated in 1999 and online ticketing was introduced on 3 August 2002 through IRCTC. In 2015, the first Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) powered trains were rolled out. Since 1925, the Railway budget was presented before the Union budget till 2016. The central government approved the merger of the Rail and General budgets from 2017. On 31 March 2017, Indian Railways announced a target of electrifying the entire rail network would be electrified by 2023. In March 2020, Indian Railways announced a nationwide shutdown of passenger service to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in India with the freight operations continuing to transport essential goods. The railways resumed passenger services in a phased manner in May 2020.
Starting in the 2010s, various infrastructure modernization projects have been undertaken including high-speed rail, redevelopment of 400 stations, doubling tracks to reduce congestion, refurbishing of coaches, Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled tracking of trains and modernization of locomotives. In 2018, a semi-high speed self-propelled train-set capable of reaching speeds of over was rolled out from ICF and the Vande Bharat Express was launched in 2019. Indian Railways announced plans to become a net-zero carbon emission railway by 2030 and has implemented rainwater harvesting at stations, reforestation along the tracks, introduction of solar-powered trains, installation of solar and wind power generation facilities, and sustainable LED lighting at all the stations. Indian railways removed all unstaffed level crossings by 2019 with staffed level crossings being replaced by bridges. Other safety projects include the extension of an automated fire alarm system to all air-conditioned coaches and GPS-enabled Fog Pilot Assistance System railway signalling devices. In 2020, Indian Railways allowed the operation of private passenger trains for the first time with the first train flagged off from Coimbatore in June 2022.

== Infrastructure and operations ==
=== Rolling stock ===
;Locomotives
The first trains in the 1800s were hauled by imported steam locomotives. In 1877, the first locomotive was built in India. Electric locomotives were introduced in 1925 and diesel locomotives later in 1954. By 1990s, steam locomotives were phased out and are currently operated only on mountrain railways and on heritage trains. Locomotives are classified by track gauge (broad/metre/narrow/narrower), motive power (electric/diesel/battery), function (passenger/goods/mixed), power rating (x1000 HP) and model in a four or five letter code. The locomotives may be Longer Hood Front (LHF), where the driver cabin is behind the hood of the engine or Short Hood Front (SHF), where the cabin is located towards the front. Multiple units (MU) are propelled by locomotives integrated with train-sets. In 2015, the first Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) powered MUs were rolled out by ICF. In 2018, the semi-high speed self-propelled Vande Bharat train-set was rolled out from ICF. Locomotives are manufactured by five owned manufacturing units of the Indian Railways and BHEL. , 37% of the trains are operated by diesel locomotives and rest mostly by electric locomotives. , Indian Railways had 10,238 electric and 4,543 diesel locomotives amongst others.

;Passenger coaches


The early rail coaches were based on a prototype by a Swiss company and were termed as ICF coaches after Integral coach factory (ICF), the first coach manufacturing unit in India. 
These coaches, manufactured from 1955 to 2018, were largely in use till the early 2010s. From the late 1990s, the ICF coaches were replaced by safer and newer LHB coaches designed by Linke-Hofmann-Busch of Germany. In the late 2010s, Indian railways started upgrading the coaches of select trains from LHB to new Tejas coaches with enhanced features. , Indian Railways had 91,948 passenger coaches, including 65,016 conventional, 12,229 EMU and 1,681 DMU coaches. Coaches are manufactured by five manufacturing units of the Indian Railways and public sector companies BEML and BHEL. The coaching stock have unique five or six digit identifiers. Till 2018, the first two digits indicating the year of manufacture and the last three digits indicating the class. In 2018, the numbering system was changed with the first two digits indicating the year of manufacture and the last four digits indicating the sequence number.

;Multiple units
In the 1960s, Electric multiple units (EMU) were developed for short-haul and suburban rail transit. On regional short-distance routes, Mainline electrical multiple unit (MEMU) and Diesel electrical multiple unit (DEMU) trains are run. These train sets run in formation of 6, 9, 12 or 15 coaches and a three-car set is typified by a motor coaches and two passenger coaches. These train-sets are self-propelled with capability for faster acceleration or deceleration. In 2018, Indian Railways also rolled out semi-high speed self-propelled train sets with modified coaches for inter city trains.

;Goods wagons

Indian Railways hauls variety of cargo to cater to various requirements and have specialized rolling stock corresponding to the cargo hauled. There are 243 types of rolling stock used for cargo operations. These include covered wagons, boxcars, flat wagons, flatbeds, open wagons, hoppers, containers, automobile carriers, defense vehicle carriers and tankers. The freight cars can often carry loads from 10 to 80 tonnes per car depending on the configuration. A new wagon numbering system was adopted in Indian Railways in 2003.
The requirement of wagons was previously met by Bharat wagon and engineering with the procurement and manufacturing now done by both in public and private sector.

;Others
Apart from standard passenger classes, the Indian Railways has other specialized coach types used for dedicated functions. These include accident relief medical vans, brake vans, generator cars, inspection carriages, military cars, pantry car and parcel vans. These may be dedicated self-propelled units or attached to train-sets.

;Manufacturing
Indian Railways operates various manufacturing units. Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW), commissioned in 1950, was the first locomotive manufacturing unit in India. The first rail coache manufacturing unit, the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) was established at Madras in 1956. Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW), commissioned in 1961, is the second locomotive manufacturing unit operated by Indian Railways. BHEL, Patiala Locomotive Works, Diesel Locomotive Factory, Marhowrah and Electric Locomotive Factory, Madhepura also manufacture locomotives in India. Railway coaches are also manufactured at coach factories at Karputhala, Raebareli, Sonipat and Latur. Indian Railways also operates three rail wheel manufacturing factories at Bangalore, Chhpra and Raebareli.

;Maintenance
The locomotives are operated and maintained by 40 locomotive sheds. The repair and maintenance of the fleet of other rolling stock is carried out at 294 carriage &amp; wagon repair units across various zones of IR.

=== Tracks ===

, Indian railway network spanned in route length. With of the lines having two or more tracks, total running track length was , while total trackage (including sidings) was .

Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from , though the maximum speed attained by passenger trains is . The network was built with a variety of gauges, including broad gauge, metre gauge and and narrow gauge; but a long-term effort, Project Unigauge, aims to convert most of these to broad gauge. , or 96.59% of the network was broad-gauge, or 1.68% metre-gauge and or 1.74% narrow-gauge. The broad-gauge network is equipped with long-welded, high-tensile 52kg/60kg 90 UTS rails with pre-stressed concrete (PSC) sleepers and elastic fastenings.

;Trunk routes
As of July 2020, there are seven major routes a total length of which have been classified as High-Density Network (HDN) routes or Trunk routes. There is 60% traffic on these routes, which are designed for speed limit of 160 km/h. These Trunk route include Chennai–Howrah, Chennai–Mumbai, Delhi–Chennai, Delhi–Howrah, Howrah–Mumbai, Mumbai–Delhi and Delhi–Guwahati.

;Electrification

The first electric train ran in Bombay in 1925 on DC traction. In 1928, DC traction was introduced on the suburban of Bombay by the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway between Colaba and Borivili and between Madras beach and Tambaram by the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway in 1931. In 1957, Indian Railways decided to adopt 25 kV AC as its standard. The first 25 kV AC EMUs operated in Calcutta in 1962 and Madras in 1968. In 2017, Indian Railways announced a plan to electrify the country&#x27;s entire broad gauge rail network by 2023. Post electrification, 30 billion kWh of electricity will be required on an annual basis for Indian Railways. , Indian Railways has electrified or 97.05% of the total broad-gauge route length. Indian Railway uses 25 kV AC traction on all its electrified tracks.

;Cross-border

India shares land border with multiple countries and have rail-links with some of them. Bangladesh is connected to West Bengal with a construction of new rail link connecting Tripura with Akhaura. Two rail links to Nepal exist as of 2021, with a third under construction. There is an existing railink with Pakistan through Attari–Wagah border.

=== Signaling and communication ===

Indian Railways uses a range of signalling technologies and methods to manage its train operations based on traffic density and safety requirements. , automatic block signalling is used on a total route length of for train operations – concentrated in high density routes, large cities and junctions. Remaining routes are based on absolute block signalling with trains manually controlled by signal men from the signal boxes typically located at stations. Few low density routes still use manual block signalling methods with communication on track clearance based on physical exchange of tokens. In a few sections, intermediate block signalling is provided to further enhance line capacity with minimal investment. , 756 block sections have intermediate block signals. Indian Railways primarily uses coloured signal lights, which replaced the earlier semaphores and disc-based signalling. It uses two-aspect, three-aspect and four (or multiple) aspect color signalling across its network.

Signals at most stations are interlocked using panel interlocking, route-relay interlocking or electronic interlocking methods that eliminate scope for human signalling errors. Indian Railways uses track circuiting, and block proving axle counters for train detection. , 6,637 stations have interlocked and multi-aspect signalling. Around 99% of key routes have track circuitry or block proving axle counters for automated train detection and Kavach automatic train protection system has been implemented in of tracks. The railways has about of optical fiber cable network used for train control, voice and data communication with of the route covered by GSM-R based Mobile Train Radio communication. In December 2017, Indian Railways announced that it will implement ETCS Level 2 system for signalling and control on key routes with an investment of .

=== Stations ===

, Indian Railways manages and operates 7,461 stations. Prior to 2017, the stations were classified into seven categories based on their earnings. Since 2017, Indian Railways categorizes the stations by commercial importance into three different categories namely Non Suburban Group (NSG), Suburban Group (SG) and Halt Group (HG). These are further subdivided into subcategories based on their commercial importance (NSG 1–6, SG 1-3 and from HG 1–3). The commercial importance of a station is determined by taking into account its passenger footfall, earnings and strategic importance and these categories are used to determine the minimum essential amenities required by each station.

== Services ==
=== Passenger ===
==== Travel classes ====

Indian Railways offers various travel classes on its coaches. For the purpose of identification in passenger trains, coaches in a train-set are assigned an alpha-numeric code. The first letter identifies the coach class and the second letter identifies the coach number. The berths and seats are numbered by an alphanumeric code with the letter(s) identifying the berth/seat type and numbers identifying the position. In standard coaches, the berths and seats are classified as follows:
Saloon coaches are also available for chartering which are equipped with a bedroom and kitchen and can be attached to normal trains.

==== Passenger trains ====

Indian Railways operates various classes of passenger and express trains. The trains are classified basis average speed and facilities with express trains having fewer halts, priority on rail network and faster average speed. The trains are identified by five digit numbers with train-pairs traveling in opposite directions usually labelled with consecutive numbers. Express trains often have specific unique names for easy identification. In 2018–19, Indian Railways operated 13,523 passenger trains on average daily and carried 8.44 billion passengers. India Railways operates various categories of express trains including Rajdhani Express, Shatabdi Express, Garib Rath Express, Double Decker Express, Tejas Express, Gatimaan Express, Humsafar Express, Duronto Express, Yuva Express, Uday Express, Jan Shatabdi Express, Sampark Kranti Express, Vivek Express, Rajya Rani Express, Mahamana Express, Antyodaya Express, Jan Sadharan Express, Suvidha Express and Intercity Express.

==== High-speed rail ====
Rajdhani Express introduced in 1969 were the first trains to reach speeds of up to . Shatabdi Express introduced in 1988, are capable of running at a maximum speed of . In 2019, Vande Bharat Express was launched with self-propelled EMU train-sets capable of reaching maximum speed of with operational speeds restricted to . A non-airconditioned semi-high speed train-set hauled by two modified WAP-5 locomotives was launched as Amrit Bharat Express. A high-speed rail line is under-construction between Mumbai and Ahmedabad which will become the first true high-speed rail line when completed in 2026.

==== Mountain railways ====

Mountain Railways of India refer to three rail lines operated by Indian Railways in hilly terrain. Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow-gauge railway in the Lesser Himalayas of West Bengal was opened in 1881.
 The mountain railways were designated as World Heritage Sites in 1999. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow-gauge railway in the Siwalik Hills of Himachal Pradesh started operating in 1903. The Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a rack railway in the Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu was opened in 1908 and is the only operational rack railway in India. These railways operate with its own dedicated fleet of locomotives and coaches.

==== Suburban and metro ====
The first suburban electric trains were introduced in Bombay in 1925. Chennai suburban lines started operating in 1931 and Kolkata in 1957. Later, AC traction was adopted for suburban lines and are currently operated by Multiple Units (MUs) of various configurations. In 1984, Kolkata Metro, the first metro system and the only system operated by Indian Railways was commissioned. Opened in November 1995, Chennai MRTS became the first operational elevated railway line in India. Indian Railways operates suburban railway systems across the cities of Mumbai (suburban), Chennai (suburban and MRTS), Kolkata (suburban and metro) and Secunderabad (MMTS) covering six railway zones.

==== Tourism ====
Indian Railways offers tour packages through IRCTC. It operates tourist trains and coach services on popular tourist circuits in different regions of the country. It operates luxury tourist trains such as Maharajas&#x27; Express, Palace on Wheels, Golden Chariot and Deccan Odyssey, deluxe tourist trains such as Mahaparinirvan Express. It also operates heritage and exhibition trains on special circumstances.

==== Ticketing and fares ====

In 1986, computerized ticketing and reservations were introduced before which ticketing was done manually. Self-printing ticket machines (SPTM) were introduced in 1988. Centralized computer reservation system was deployed in September 1996. The ticketing network at stations is computerized with the exception of few stations. The Indian Railways website went online in February 2000 and online ticketing was introduced on 3 August 2002 through IRCTC. Indian Railways now provides multiple channels for passengers to book tickets through website, smartphone apps, SMS, rail reservation counters at train stations, or through private ticket booking counters. Reserved tickets may be booked up to 60 days in advance and confirmed reservation tickets will show the passenger and fare details along with berth or seat number(s) allocated to them on the ticket.

In case of no confirmed reservation, a wait-list number is assigned and wait-listed tickets get confirmed if there are cancellations of already reserved tickets. Reservation against cancellation tickets is an intermediate category between the waiting and confirmed lists in sleeper classes which allows a ticket holder to board the train and share a berth. Reserved tickets can be booked by passengers who want to travel at short notice at higher fares through the Tatkal train ticket, where no refund is applicable on cancellation. A valid proof for the purchase of ticket along with photo identification is required to board the train. Unreserved tickets for short distance or unplanned travels may be purchased at stations or through UTS mobile app at any time before departure. Holders of such tickets may only board the general or unreserved coaches. Suburban networks also issue unreserved tickets valid for a limited time or season passes with unlimited travel between two stops for a period of time.

India has some of the lowest train fares in the world, and lower class passenger fares are subsidised. Discounted fares are applicable for railway employees, senior citizens (over age 60), the differently-abled, students, athletes, patients and those taking competitive examinations. Seats of lower class of accommodation are reserved for women or senior citizens in some trains.

=== Freight ===

The first rail operational in Madras in 1837 was used for ferrying granite. The first dedicated commercial freight rail was operated between Bombay and Ahmedabad in 1966. Indian Railways ferries various commodities and cargo to cater to various industrial, consumer, and agricultural segments. Apart from dedicated freight trains, parcels, mail and small cargo are carried on specialized carriages attached to passenger trains. In 2023–24, Indian Railways operated 11,724 freight trains on average daily and transported 1588.06 million tonnes of freight.

Indian Railways has historically subsidized the passenger segment with income from the freight business and prioritized passenger trains on the network. Hence, freight services were unable to complete other modes of transport on both cost and speed of delivery, leading to continuous erosion of market share till the early 2000s. To counter this, Indian Railways established the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India in 2006 to construct dedicated freight corridors to reduce congestion, increase speed and reliability and proposed upgradation of existing goods sheds, attracting private capital to build multi-commodity multi-modal logistics terminals, changing container sizes, operating time-tabled freight trains and tweaking with the freight pricing/product mix. End-to-end integrated transport solutions such as roll-on, roll-off (RORO) service, a road-rail system pioneered by Konkan Railway in 1999 to carry trucks on flatbed trailers is extended to other routes.

== Accidents and incidents ==
As per the Ministry of Railways, there have been more than 38,500 railway accidents from 1961 to 2019. In 2019-20, the Indian Railways reported zero passenger deaths due to accidents for the first time in its history. At least 313 people died in 40 train accidents in 2023-24 and 748 people have died in 638 train accidents in the previous ten years.

<text>The Old Woman River is a river in Algoma District of Ontario, Canada, which empties into Old Woman Bay on Lake Superior south of Wawa. It flows through Lake Superior Provincial Park.

The river follows a fault which became a spillway for glacial meltwater following the last ice age. The river&#x27;s valley has extensive deposits of sand and gravel. At its mouth, the river bends sharply behind a beach berm, that has formed as a result of prevailing westerly winds, which in turn causes lake waves to dam the river&#x27;s mouth with sand.

Towering cliffs along the bay have been home to peregrine falcons. 

The name for the bay and river come from a rock formation near the river&#x27;s mouth that resembles the face of an old woman.

<text>Elwyn Ralph Berlekamp (September 6, 1940 – April 9, 2019) was a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Berlekamp was widely known for his work in computer science, coding theory and combinatorial game theory.

Berlekamp invented an algorithm to factor polynomials and the Berlekamp switching game, and was one of the inventors of the Berlekamp–Welch algorithm and the Berlekamp–Massey algorithms, which are used to implement Reed–Solomon error correction. He also co-invented the Berlekamp–Rabin algorithm, Berlekamp–Zassenhaus algorithm, and the Berlekamp–Van Lint–Seidel graph. 

Berlekamp had also been active in investing, and ran Axcom, which became the Renaissance Technologies&#x27; Medallion Fund.

==Life and education==
Berlekamp was born in Dover, Ohio. His family moved to Northern Kentucky, where from 1954 Berlekamp attended Fort Thomas Highlands High School in Fort Thomas, Kentucky. He was elected class president and joined the swim team which practiced naked at the local YMCA pool; Berlekamp was the slowest swimmer but chose swimming because of the low level of competition compared to other sports. He decided to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) after learning it did not have an American football team. At MIT, his freshman professors included John Forbes Nash Jr. and he was a Putnam Fellow during his senior year in 1961. He completed his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in electrical engineering in 1962. Berlekamp did internships at Bell Labs in 1960 and 1962, where his boss was John Larry Kelly Jr. Continuing his studies at MIT, he finished his Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1964; his advisors were Robert G. Gallager, Peter Elias, Claude Shannon, and John Wozencraft.

Berlekamp met his wife, Jennifer Wilson, in 1964 after juggling in his apartment and having to apologize for causing a noise disturbance. They had two daughters and a son. He lived in Piedmont, California and died in April 2019 at the age of 78 from complications of pulmonary fibrosis.

==Career==
Berlekamp was a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley from 1964 until 1966, when he became a mathematics researcher at Bell Labs. In 1971, Berlekamp returned to Berkeley as professor of mathematics and computer science, where he served as the advisor for over twenty doctoral students.

He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1977) and the National Academy of Sciences (1999). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996, and became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012. In 1991, he received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal, and in 1993, the Claude E. Shannon Award. In 1998, he received a Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation from the IEEE Information Theory Society. Along with Tom M. Rodgers he was one of the founders of Gathering 4 Gardner and was on its board for many years. In the mid-1980s, he was president of Cyclotomics, Inc., a corporation that developed error-correcting code technology.

He studied various games, including dots and boxes, fox and geese, and, especially, Go. Berlekamp and co-author David Wolfe describe methods for analyzing certain classes of Go endgames in the book &quot;Mathematical Go.&quot;

==Berlekamp and Martin Gardner==
Berlekamp was a close friend of &quot;Scientific American&quot; columnist Martin Gardner and was an important member of the gifted and diverse group of people that Gardner nurtured and acted as a conduit for; people who inspired Gardner and who were in turn inspired by him. Berlekamp teamed up with John Horton Conway and Richard K. Guy, two other close associates of Gardner, to co-author the book &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot;, leading to his recognition as one of the founders of combinatorial game theory. The dedication of their book says, &quot;To Martin Gardner, who has brought more mathematics to more millions than anyone else.&quot;

Berlekamp and Gardner both had great love for and were strong advocates of recreational mathematics. Conferences called Gathering 4 Gardner (G4G) are held every two years to celebrate the Gardner legacy. Berlekamp was one of the founders of G4G and was on its board of directors for many years.

<doc id="655904" wikidata="Q6412096" url="?curid=655904" title="King Street Wharf">
<text>King Street Wharf is a mixed-use tourism, commercial, residential, retail and maritime development on the eastern shore of Darling Harbour, an inlet of Sydney Harbour, Australia. Located on the western side of the city&#x27;s central business district, the complex served as a maritime industrial area in the early and mid 20th century. It was redeveloped as part of extensive urban renewal projects around Sydney Harbour in the 1980s and 90s. The complex is host to a cluster of nine wharves, with the first two wharves currently in use by private ferry operator Captain Cook Cruises and a third decommissioned by Sydney Ferries.

==Description==
King Street Wharf is adjacent to the Darling Harbour tourist precinct, and on the western edge of the Sydney central business district.

The residential towers occupy the area bounded by King Street to the south, Shelley Street to the east, Erskine Street to the north and Lime Street to the west, including:
*155 residential apartments in the 14-story north tower
*107 residential apartments in the 10-story south tower
*95 residential apartments in the 8-story buildings at 45–49 Shelley Street

The commercial waterfront is between Lime Street and Darling Harbour, and extends slightly north of the end of Erskine Street. It consists of 85 commercial suites with a retail component set underneath. This retail area contains 11 restaurants, the largest of which seats 450 including its outdoor areas.

==Developments==
Under Walker Corporation, the retail and restaurants, stages of residential and serviced apartments and commercial/retail strata suites were completed. The remainder of the development parcels are still being developed by Brookfield Multiplex. They include the completed KPMG headquarters, American Express House, Ibis Hotel, Macquarie Bank headquarters and One Shelley Street office building.
The remaining development will consist of further commercial and retail and public parking expected to be completed over the next few years. It also involves associated infrastructure such as roadworks, car parking, charter vessel berthing facilities and coach parking.

==Wharves==
===Wharf 1===
Wharf 1 is currently used by Captain Cook Cruises as a stop on its Darling Harbour to Circular Quay service. The wharf is serviced by 22 daily services on weekdays, and 23 daily services on weekends and public holidays on looping stopping patterns originating from Harbour Master Steps ferry wharf and terminating at Circular Quay ferry wharf. An additional morning service on weekends originates from the Pier 26 ferry wharf.

===Wharf 2===
Wharf 2 is currently used by Captain Cook Cruises as the terminus of its Darling Harbour to Manly shuttle service. Seventeen services to Manly Wharf depart from Wharf 2 daily on weekdays, with seven departures on weekends and public holidays.

===Wharf 3===

Originally opened as one of the many privately operated wharves in the King Street Wharf development, Wharf 3 was selected as the recommended temporary site for a second major terminal on the Sydney Ferries network in the Walker Report, which also recommended that the King Street ferry wharf be upgraded and established as a Western city ferry hub to lessen ferry congestion at Circular Quay, with fare gates and ticketing machines introduced. These were implemented in October 2010.

It was used by Sydney Ferries First Fleet and RiverCat class ferries operating F3 Parramatta River and F4 Darling Harbour services from 2010 until 2017. On 26 June 2017, Sydney Ferries services ceased using the wharf with the opening of the nearby Barangaroo ferry wharf.

<text>The Azerbaijan national football team () is the national football team of Azerbaijan and is controlled by Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan. It represents Azerbaijan in international football competitions. The majority of Azerbaijan&#x27;s home matches are held at the national stadium, Baku Olympic Stadium, with friendly matches sometimes hosted at club stadiums.

The Azerbaijan national football team has taken part in qualification for each major tournament since Euro 1996, but has never qualified for the finals tournament of any World Cup or European Championships. Despite this, Azerbaijan was the first Caucasus country to host a major tournament, the UEFA Euro 2020, even though the national side was the only host to be eliminated in the first round of qualifying.

==History==
===Early period (before the 1920s)===
In the early twentieth century, football began to become popular in Azerbaijan, which was then part of the Russian Empire. In 1912, Azerbaijani football players had their first &quot;international match&quot; and they won in Tbilisi, Georgia against the local &quot;Sokol&quot; team with 4:2. During 1912–1913, matches between Azerbaijani and Georgian football teams were organized, first in Tbilisi and then in Baku. In 1914, the Football Union was founded in Azerbaijan. The Football Union undertook the organization of official city championships and other competitions.

===Soviet era (1920s–1991)===
The oldest records of football teams in Soviet Azerbaijan goes back to 1926–1927, when Trans-Caucasian Championship was organized in Tbilisi. Three South Caucasian countries participated: Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia. The Azerbaijan national football team held its first friendly matches against Georgia and Armenia in 1927 for the Trans-Caucasian Championship in Georgia. Also in 1926, football players from Azerbaijan played three matches with Football team from Iran in Baku. In 1929, there were played three matches between these teams in Tehran. In all matches Azerbaijan players won.

The 1960s is considered the Golden Age for Azerbaijani football as it produced great players like Anatoliy Banishevskiy, Alakbar Mammadov and the football referee Tofiq Bahramov, most famous for being the linesman who helped to award a goal for England in the 1966 World Cup Final between England and West Germany.

===Post-independence (1992–present)===
====1990s====
After Azerbaijan gained its independence in 1991, AFFA — Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan — was created. In 1992, renowned Azerbaijani footballer Alekper Mamedov became the first head coach of the Azerbaijani national football team, compiling a 3–1 record as coach that includes the first ever national team victory, over Georgia on May 25, 1993. In 1994, the national team was accepted into FIFA and UEFA. The security issues, forced the team to play all of its home Euro 96 qualifiers in Trabzon, Turkey.

====2000s====

As of the early 2000s, Azerbaijani football federation started to integrate more players to the national team through FIFA&#x27;s eligibility rules. In February 2004, Carlos Alberto Torres, captain of the Brazil team that won the 1970 FIFA World Cup was appointed its national coach. Despite a poor start, a 0–6 defeat to Israel on February 18, Azerbaijan won their first ever away match, 3–2 against Kazakhstan on April 28. In June 2005, following a 3–0 defeat by Poland, Torres stood down from the position, to be replaced by former Neftchi coach Vagif Sadygov, his third spell as coach of Azerbaijan. Shahin Diniyev took over as manager in November 2005. He resigned on 31 October 2007, and Gjoko Hadzievski was named as care-taking coach of Azerbaijan.

In April 2008, former German football player and coach Berti Vogts was appointed as a manager of Azerbaijan on a two-year contract. Azerbaijan had a mixed qualifying campaign, finishing with 5 points, just missing out on a last place to Liechtenstein with 2 points.

In November 2009, AFFA extended Berti Vogts&#x27; contract a further two years, making him the first manager to manage the weak Azerbaijani national team in two qualification cycles.

====2010s====
In 2010, following a shock win over Turkey, the team reached 90th place in FIFA World Rankings, Azerbaijan&#x27;s highest position ever in country&#x27;s football history. After victory over Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan also broke their scoring and points records by gaining 7 points and scoring 10 goals.

In November 2011, AFFA extended Berti Vogts&#x27; contract a further two years, until the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification cycle. Under Vogts, Azerbaijan had some poor results, not being able to defeat second-string sides. Vogts faced major criticism, protest and demonstration from local supporters and the media. However, Azerbaijan managed to finish qualification cycle in fourth place, the team&#x27;s best ever finish. In December 2013, Vogts being granted a new two-year contract, with aim to lead Azerbaijan through EURO 2016 qualifying. In July 2014, Azerbaijan beat its ranking record by reaching 73rd place in FIFA World Rankings. Following three straight losses, Vogts resigned from his post after spending six years in charge of Azerbaijan.

Succeeding Vogts as full-time manager was former Croatia international Robert Prosinečki. He guided the Azerbaijani team to another record points haul (10) in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying, but the team still finished fifth in the six-team Group C. Prosinečki resigned after deciding not to extend his contract with the Azerbaijan Football Federation and was succeeded by fellow countryman Nikola Jurčević.

====2020s====
The UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying proved to be a disaster for Azerbaijan as the team finished in bottom with a complete seven defeats, including a famous 1–5 at home against Slovakia, and only one draw, which was, surprisingly, against 2018 FIFA World Cup runners-up Croatia, the home of the manager. Nikola Jurčević departed following the poor performance of Azerbaijan. After the qualifying, Azerbaijan turned out to be the only country ever to not qualify for a tournament they co-hosted.

The qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup with new coach Gianni De Biasi also went horribly, with Azerbaijan getting only a single point in Group A in matches with strongholds Portugal and Serbia and secondary sides Ireland and Luxembourg. The Nations League that year was more successful. Azerbaijan was drawn into Group 3 of League C with Kazakhstan, Belarus and Slovakia. After failing to win against Kazakhstan and Slovakia and securing themselves a goalless draw against Belarus, the matches of the second leg were all wins. At the end, Azerbaijan finished second with 10 points, three points away from promoted first-place Kazakhstan. After losing three matches in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying and drawing once, De Biasi got sacked on 22 October 2023. The games without a manager were equal: Azerbaijan won 2 matches out of four, including a surprising 3-0 defeat of already-eliminated Sweden. The other two matches were both lost.

In March 2024, the assistant manager Arif Asadov was hired as caretaker manager. Under Asadov, the team won two out of 4 games. In June 2024, Former UEFA Euro 2016 winning coach Fernando Santos was appointed as the new manager. The 2024-25 UEFA Nations League went badly, securing only a draw against Estonia and getting relegated.

===Colours===

As of UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying round, Azerbaijan&#x27;s home colours are all-red kit. The team wears an all-blue kit for away games. This combination of colours is traditional for the national team since their first game. At the beginning of 90s, the team wore a white shirt, but towards the end of the decade it was transformed into blue-white striped shirts. At the beginning of the 2000s, the kit was replaced by the white shirt with a vertical tricolour stripe, formed of the colors from the national flag of Azerbaijan on the chest. The kit was changed into blue shirts, red shorts and green socks only for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying round. After the tournament, the national team went back to their usual combination of colours.

Azerbaijan national team&#x27;s away colours were yellow-black striped shirts, black shorts and yellow socks until UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying round, when it was decided to abandon this kit in favor of the completely blue. During the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying round games the team has used an all red kit.

Since 2017, Azerbaijan&#x27;s kit have been supplied by Nike. They took over from Puma, who were Azerbaijan&#x27;s kit suppliers between 2004 and 2006. Before that Umbro were Azerbaijan&#x27;s kit suppliers between 2002 and 2004.

===Nickname===
Azerbaijan is often referred to by the media and supporters as &quot;Milli&quot; (The National), which is the nickname associated with all of Azerbaijan&#x27;s international sporting teams due to the team&#x27;s utilization of the country&#x27;s national colors.

===Stadium===

Most of Azerbaijan&#x27;s home matches are played at the new Baku Olympic Stadium in Baku. It has been Azerbaijan&#x27;s primary home stadium ever since the move from Tofiq Bahramov Stadium in 2015. Today, some qualifying matches and friendly matches are still hosted at the Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, whereas others are hosted at the Lankaran City Stadium, Bakcell Arena and Dalga Arena after it met UEFA stadium criteria.

===Media coverage and public relations===
Azerbaijan&#x27;s matches are presently covered by the public channel İTV. 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match rights were held by AZTV and Idman Azerbaijan TV.

AZTV, Idman Azerbaijan TV and Lider TV are among other networks that have previously shown live fixtures.

<text>25 meter center-fire pistol is one of the ISSF shooting events, and is normally a men-only event. Its origin lies in competitions with military-style service pistols, and as such its history dates back to the 19th century.

25 meter pistol (formerly called &quot;sport pistol&quot;) is essentially the women&#x27;s equivalent of this event, the only difference being the smaller rimfire caliber handguns used (often the same models only chambered for the smaller caliber).

==Handguns==

=== Caliber ===
The name &quot;center-fire&quot; describes the type of cartridges used distinguishes this event from other ISSF events shot with handguns chambered for small caliber &quot;rimfire&quot; cartridges.

The rules specify that matches are to be shot with handgun of any caliber between 7.62 mm (.30) and 9.65 mm (.38), but the most popular cartridge is the .32 S&amp;W Long Wadcutter, because it has good performance characteristics. Many countries also have laws restricting civilian ownership of firearms chambered for cartridges also used by military forces which would not apply to the rather obscure .32 S&amp;W Long.

===Type===
Using a revolver is not a disadvantage because the &quot;rapid-fire&quot; stage is not as demanding or fast as the true rapid-fire event of 25 meter rapid fire pistol. The current record is set with a revolver (Toz 49). The most popular handgun choices, however, are larger caliber versions of rimfire semi-automatic pistols originally designed for 25 meter standard pistol. Many of these pistols can be changed from one caliber to the other by simply changing the barrel and magazine. Examples of such firearms are usually from companies specializing in firearms for ISSF events like Pardini Arms, Benelli, Morini, Walther and Hämmerli and include:
*Hämmerli SP20
*Pardini HP
*Morini CM32M
*Walther GSP
*Benelli MP-90 and Benelli MP-95

==Course of fire==

A center-fire match consists of two parts of 30 shots each, both shot at 25 m:
* A &quot;precision stage&quot; where 5 shots are to be fired during a 5-minute period.
* A &quot;rapid-fire stage&quot; where, for each shot, the shooter has 3 seconds to raise his arm from a 45-degree angle and fire.
* As with all ISSF pistol disciplines, all firing must be done with one hand, unsupported.

The score zones of the targets are different for the two stages, but scores are usually similar for the two courses. In the precision stage, the target is the same as in 50 meter pistol (although at half the distance), with a 10-zone of 5 cm diameter, and in the rapid-fire stage, the target is the same as in 25 meter rapid fire pistol, with a 10-zone of 10 cm diameter.

==Popularity==
The event has not made it into the Olympic Games, and so gains little attention. It is part of the ISSF World Shooting Championships however, as well as the CISM World Championships. It is also notable for being the inspiration for the 25 meter pistol event, which is an Olympic event for women.

<text>25 meter pistol, formerly and unofficially still often known as sport pistol, is one of the ISSF shooting events. It was devised as a women&#x27;s event in the 1960s, based upon the rules of 25 meter center-fire pistol but shot with a .22-caliber sport pistol instead of the larger-caliber guns men used. As with all ISSF pistol disciplines, all firing must be done with one hand, unsupported.

In 1984, female shooting competitions began in the Olympic Games, and so sport pistol made its way into the Olympic program. Internationally, it is still only shot by women and juniors, while men have center-fire pistols instead. However, in many countries, there are also male classes in 25 meter pistol on the national level and lower.

As 25 meter pistol is Olympic, it involves shooting a final, which the center-fire event does not. The top eight contestants reach the final, which consists of four additional rapid-fire stage series of 5 shots each. The final score is added to the qualification score.

Most shooters excelling in 25 meter pistol also compete at the same level in 10 meter air pistol, a similar precision event.

<text>Honkin&#x27; on Bobo is the fourteenth studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released on March 30, 2004, by Columbia Records. The album includes 11 covers of blues and blues rock songs from the 1950s and 1960s, with one new song, &quot;The Grind&quot;. The album pays tribute to Aerosmith&#x27;s earliest influences and showcases a rawer sound when compared to their more recent commercial efforts. &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot; was produced by Jack Douglas, who was Aerosmith&#x27;s producer on a vast majority of their 1970s output.

The album sold over 160,000 copies in its first week, reaching number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 11, 2004.

==Background==
After their departure from Geffen Records in 1994, the band wanted their next record to be a blues album. &quot;Then,&quot; said singer Steven Tyler, &quot;we caught wind that Clapton was doing it, and we went, &#x27;Fuck!&#x27;… We did such incredible research for this album, too… We also thought about our roots, about paying homage to the stuff we loved: early Yardbirds and all. Some of Little Walter&#x27;s early stuff. Really obscure names… I did some digging around myself in Chicago. We had some great songs to work with – and then Clapton came along and did it.&quot;

&quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot; was recorded in Joe Perry&#x27;s ranch near Boston, with the band committing to playing only when they were in a good mood. &quot;We wanted to do something we haven&#x27;t done before and that excites us,&quot; Perry said. &quot;That&#x27;s what makes us want to do another record. Otherwise, we&#x27;d say, &#x27;OK, we&#x27;ve done everything we can do, so why bother even going in again?’&quot;

The album title was suggested by Tyler, who had heard the phrase before, possibly the song by Canadian country/bluegrass band The Good Brothers, and amused the band with it. Perry stated during a radio interview, &quot;We just know that it&#x27;s a phrase that sounds... jazzish, nastyish, so it works for us.&quot;

Many tracks feature harmonica by Tyler, including Little Walter&#x27;s &quot;Temperature&quot;. This was played on an episode of the &quot;House of Blues Radio Hour&quot; that was about the harmonica. A harmonica keychain was included with the limited edition version. Provisional artwork featured the cover&#x27;s harmonica stuffed into a model&#x27;s denim cutoffs. This was vetoed, said its proponent Tyler, &quot;because I&#x27;m in a band with four other guys.&quot;

&quot;Stop Messin&#x27; Around&quot; – a Fleetwood Mac cover, sung by Perry – had never before appeared on an Aerosmith album, despite being a staple of the band&#x27;s concerts for more than ten years.

==Reception==

Metacritic gave the album a score of 69 out of 100 based on 12 generally favorable reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that the album is the best the band has done since &quot;Pump&quot; in 1989, and that it cannot be called a &quot;blues&quot; album because it is a rock album. He called the album a &quot;surprise&quot; in that, even though the album&#x27;s artwork and title are bad, it marks a return to Aerosmith. In his &quot;Blender&quot; magazine review of the album, Jon Pareles said that the band did their blues album different from most others because, instead of making &quot;respectable&quot; cover versions, they make quite unrespectable cover versions like &quot;You Gotta Move&quot;. The album, to him, proves that Aerosmith can still rock. Chris Willman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that the album didn&#x27;t live up to what it should be because it is too loud, but some songs on the album are good.

David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote an article for the magazine comparing and contrasting Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot; and Eric Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; which also explored blues influences. He said that Clapton&#x27;s album was mostly about pain, while Aerosmith&#x27;s album was about sex and running away from lovers. He also considers &quot;Bobo&quot; to be a double-tribute album – one tribute to the original musicians and one tribute for 1960s blues-rock bands – and considers the album to be overdone, which is what Aerosmith is good at.

<text>Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero () (23 August 1896 — 18 July 1998) was a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk who was one of the most distinguished scholars and expositors of Theravada Buddhism in the twentieth century. He was highly respected by Sri Lankan Buddhists, who believed that he had achieved a higher level of spiritual development. Sri Lankan Buddhists also considered Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero as a Bodhisattva, who will attain Buddhahood in a future life.

Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero lived a modest life and did a great service for the propagation of Buddhist philosophy. In recognition of his valuable service at the Sixth Buddhist council held in Burma, the Burmese government conferred on him the title of Agga Maha Pandita (Chief Great Scholar) in 1956. Later in March 1997, the Burmese government conferred on Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero the highest Sangha title, Abhidhaja Maha Rattha Guru (Most Eminent Great Spiritual Teacher), which is equivalent to Sangharaja, in honor of his unique service to the Buddhist religion.

==Biography==
Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero was born on 23 August 1896 in Kirindigala, Balangoda, to the family of N. A. Matthias Appuhamy (Maddumahamy) and B. Heenmanike. His birth name was Punchi Mahattaya. His mother died when he was 14 days old and he was brought up by his father&#x27;s brother and his wife. His primary education was at Kumara Vidyalaya, Balangoda. He had his secondary education from Ananda College Colombo. At the age of 15, he had decided to enter the order of Buddhist monks and was ordained as a Samanera at the temple Sri Nandaramaya, Udumulla, Balangoda on 2 March 1911. He was ordained under the guidance of Daamahana Dhammananda Thero and Deniyaye Seelananda Thero was his primary teacher (&quot;Upaadhyaayanwahanse&quot;). Balangdoda Ananda Maitreya Thero received his Upasampada on 14 July 1916 at Olu Gantota Udakukhepa Seema, Balangoda.
Thero continued his studies after becoming a monk and later became a scholar in Buddhism and languages. Thero entered Ananda College, Colombo in 1919 and became a teacher at the same school in 1922. Unusually for a Theravada teacher, he publicly studied some other traditions, such as Mahayana Buddhism, mantra, and esoteric yoga. 

Ananda Maitreya Thero was the first Dharmarcharya (teacher of Buddhism) at Nalanda College Colombo when it was first established in 1925. It was Thero who named it &#x27;Nalanda&#x27; and chose &quot;Apadana Sobhini Panna&quot; meaning &quot;wisdom beautifies character&quot; as Nalanda College&#x27;s motto, which is still being used. Later he became the professor of Mahayana Buddhism at Vidyodaya University, Sri Lanka. He was appointed to the post of Dean, Faculty of Buddhist Studies in 1963. On 1 October 1966, he was appointed to the post of vice chancellor at the same university.

Ananda Maitreya Thero&#x27;s first overseas Dhamma journey was to Kerala, India in 1926. He opened the Sri Dhammananda Pirivena, Colombo in 1930. 

On 18 January 1954, Thero was appointed to the post of Sangha Nayaka of &quot;Sabaragamu-Saddhammawansa Nikaya&quot; and in the same year, he participated in the Sixth Buddhist council held in Myanmar. On 2 September 1969, Ananda Maitreya Thero was appointed as the President of Amarapura Sangha Sabhā of Sri Lanka.

Ananda Maitreya Thero was famous for his achievements in Buddhist meditation. He was known to have practiced both Samatha meditation and Vipassana meditation to a great extent and was considered to be having a highly developed mind through his meditation. Many Buddhists have experienced his powerful spiritual blessings in many more ways than one. His teachings and life have been an inspiration to many aspiring monks and lay followers.

Ananda Maitreya Thero, along with Narada Thero and Madihe Pannaseeha Thero, was and still is one of the foremostly revered and respected Buddhist monks of the twentieth century in Sri Lanka. His work and sacrifices with Anagarika Dharmapala were one of the steering forces of the upholding of Buddhism in Sri Lanka at one stage. They also traveled to many countries in the world for the propagation of Buddhism. Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero died at 11.40 p.m. on 18 July 1998 at the age of 101.

==Degrees and titles==

In 1955, the Government of Myanmar (then Burma) conferred him the title &quot;Agga Maha Pandita&quot; (Great Chief Scholar) to honor his unprecedented service at the Sixth Buddhist Council. To honor his unique service to the Buddha Śāsana, Myanmar also conferred him the highest Sangha title, &quot;Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru&quot; (Most Eminent Great Spiritual Teacher), which is equivalent to Sangharaja in 1997. Ananda Maithreya Thero received the &quot;Thripitaka Vaagishwaracharya Pravachana Visharada Raajakeeya Panditha&quot; honorary degree from the Government of Sri Lanka. In addition to that, Nayaka Thero has received two honorary titles, &quot;Saahithyasuuri&quot; from Vidyodaya University and &quot;Saahithya Chakrawarthi&quot; from Vidyalankara University.

The humbleness of Maha Nayaka Thero&#x27;s character is clearly shown when he publicly stated that he had no liking whatsoever for titles and awards, but that he was rather accepting it to satisfy the presenter. He quoted Buddha in his speech saying &quot;I often remind myself of My Great Buddha&#x27;s preaching in the Samyutta Nikaya or the Abhidhamma Pitaka of the worthlessness and futileness of the craving for awards, titles, and commanding positions&quot;.

==Survey of writings==

Ananda Maitreya Thero wrote nearly fifty books on &quot;Suttas&quot; (scripture), &quot;Vinaya&quot; (monastic discipline), on &quot;Abhidhamma&quot; (metaphysics), and on Pali and Sanskrit grammar. His book, &quot;Sakyasimhavadanaya hevat Buddha Charitra&quot; (&quot;The Life of the Buddha&quot;), is considered as a textbook. Most of his books are written in English and Sinhala languages.

<text>Super Thursday is significant both in politics and in publishing.
==Politics==

Many elections in the United Kingdom took place on &quot;Super Thursday&quot;, 10 June 2004.

*2004 London mayoral election – won by Ken Livingstone
*2004 London Assembly election
*the United Kingdom part of the 2004 European Parliament election
*local elections in many parts of England and Wales. In many districts ward boundaries were redrawn and so the entire council was being re-elected. This happened in all the metropolitan boroughs and all the counties and county boroughs of Wales.

The UK government used this opportunity to trial all-postal voting in both the local and European elections across four regions: North East, North West, East Midlands, and Yorkshire and the Humber. For more details, see here.

===Results===
The ruling Labour Party polled poorly in the local elections, and was beaten into third place, in terms of share of the vote, after the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats. They lost control of several large (and traditionally Labour) councils, including Newcastle upon Tyne and Leeds.

Of the minor parties, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party increased their number of councillors, whilst the United Kingdom Independence Party picked up a handful. The British National Party failed to make predicted gains in Burnley, and lost a seat in Blackburn with Darwen, but took three seats in Epping Forest and four in Bradford.

The UKIP made a much stronger showing in the European Parliament elections, where it increased its number of MEPs from 3 to 12.

See 2004 United Kingdom local elections for the full council results.

==Publishing==
Super Thursday, in the publishing industry, also refers to an annual industry promotional event held on the second Thursday in October. &quot;The Guardian&quot; termed it &quot;the publishing industry’s major assault on the Christmas market,&quot; and the occasion is associated with activities, advertising, and booklists previewed in the following day&#x27;s &quot;The Bookseller&quot;.&quot; Super Thursday creates a &quot;buzz&quot; around books and, according to Waterstone&#x27;s national press officer Jon Howells (quoted on 1 October 2009): &quot;In the space of a year Super Thursday has gone from a clever turn of phrase to an essential date in the bookselling calendar. It has alerted everyone – booksellers, publishers, the media, and ultimately customers, to the incredible array of new titles available, and marks the unofficial start of the Christmas season.&quot; Sp

<text>Milenko Stojković (; 1769, Kličevac, Požarevac – 1831, Bakhchysarai, Crimea) was a Serbian revolutionary and &quot;bimbaša&quot; in the First Serbian Uprising early in the 19th century. He is most famous for executing four dahije (renegade janissaries) tyrants during the start of the First Serbian Uprising, in vengeance for the &quot;Slaughter of the Knezes&quot;.

Having apprehended and, while running away, Milenko executed the Turkish tyrants Aganlija, Kučuk Alija, Mula Jusuf, and Mehmed Fočić, responsible for the killing of Serbian Princes that triggered the First Serbian Uprising, on the island of Ada Kaleh on the River Danube. He was also known for keeping a harem of Muslim women who were widows of slain Ottoman Turks.

He distinguished himself in the Battle of Ivankovac, and Battle of Malajnica and Štubik.

In 1810, Stojković and Petar Dobrnjac led a failed revolt against uprising leader Karađorđe, leading them to be banished from Serbia a year later.

He died in Russia.

<text>The Lithuania national football team () represents Lithuania in men&#x27;s international football, and is controlled by the Lithuanian Football Federation, the governing body for football in Lithuania. They played their first match in 1923. In 1940, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union; the country regained its independence in 1990 and played their first match thereafter against Georgia on 27 May of that year.

Although Lithuania has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, nor the UEFA European Championship, they have successfully participated in the regional Baltic Cup tournament, which takes place every two years between Lithuania and their Baltic rivals, Latvia and Estonia. Lithuania has won the Baltic Cup championship 10 times out of 29 appearances, and only Latvia has won it more frequently. Despite this Lithuania holds the record for winning the most consecutive Baltic Cup championships, four titles in a row from 1996 to 2000.

From 2012 until 2022, the national team played their home matches at the LFF Stadium in Vilnius.

From 2022, the national team plays their home matches at the Darius and Girėnas Stadium in Kaunas.

==History==

On 24 June 1923, Lithuania played their first ever game, at the Lietuvos Fizinio Lavinimosi Sąjunga Stadionas, resulting in a 5–0 loss against Estonia. In 1924, Lithuania entered the 1924 Olympics in France, losing 9–0 against Switzerland on 25 May 1924. Two days later, Lithuania suffered a 10–0 loss to Egypt, a record defeat to date. During the early years of the Lithuanian national team, Lithuania regularly played Baltic neighbours Estonia and Latvia, with Lithuania&#x27;s first win coming in a 2–1 away win against Estonia on 24 August 1924 in Tallinn. In 1930, Lithuania won the third edition of the Baltic Cup in Kaunas. On 13 October 1940, Lithuania played their final game for just shy of 50 years, a 4–3 win against Latvia, following the first Soviet annexation of the country.

Lithuania&#x27;s first game following the declaration of independence in 1990 was a 2–2 draw against Georgia in Tbilisi on 27 May 1990. In the 1990s, Lithuania established a respectable presence in the World Cup and European Championship qualifiers: third place in their group in both Euro 1996 and the 1998 World Cup qualifiers. In the Euro 2004 qualifiers, they were once again contenders for qualification and managed an away draw with Germany and a home win over Scotland; however, a 1–0 defeat to Scotland in the final game ended their hopes. Although finishing fifth in their 2006 World Cup qualifying group, Lithuania were nevertheless competitive.

Lithuania drew with world champions Italy 1–1 in Naples in a Euro 2008 qualifying game on 2 September 2006, in the first competitive game that Italy played since the World Cup final.

On 6 September 2008, Lithuania defeated Romania 3–0 in a 2010 World Cup qualifier. The victory was regarded by many as &quot;a historic win.&quot; It was followed by another successful 2–0 performance against Austria in Marijampolė on 10 September 2008.

<doc id="655960" wikidata="Q1353749" url="?curid=655960" title="Michelle (song)">
<text>&quot;Michelle&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1965 album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. It was composed principally by Paul McCartney, with the middle eight co-written with John Lennon. The song is a love ballad with part of its lyrics sung in French.

Following its inclusion on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, the song was released as a single in some European countries and in New Zealand, and on an EP in France, in early 1966. It was a number 1 hit for the Beatles in Belgium, France, Norway, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Concurrent recordings of the song by David and Jonathan and the Overlanders were similarly successful in North America and Britain, respectively. &quot;Michelle&quot; won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1967 and has since become one of the most widely recorded of all Beatles songs.

==Composition==
The instrumental music of &quot;Michelle&quot; originated separately from the lyrical concept. According to McCartney:
&quot;Michelle&quot; was a tune that I&#x27;d written in Chet Atkins&#x27; finger-picking style. There is a song he did called &quot;Trambone&quot; with a repetitive top line, and he played a bass line while playing a melody. This was an innovation for us; even though classical guitarists had played it, no rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll guitarists had played it. The first person we knew to use finger-picking style was Chet Atkins ... I never learned it. But based on Atkins&#x27; &quot;Trambone&quot;, I wanted to write something with a melody and a bass line in it, so I did. I just had it as an instrumental in C.

The words and style of &quot;Michelle&quot; have their origins in the popularity of Parisian Left Bank culture during McCartney&#x27;s Liverpool days. In his description, &quot;it was at the time of people like Juliette Greco, the French bohemian thing.&quot; McCartney had gone to a party of art students where a student with a goatee and a striped T-shirt was singing a French song. He soon wrote a farcical imitation to entertain his friends that involved French-sounding groaning instead of real words. The song remained a party piece until 1965, when John Lennon suggested he rework it into a proper song for inclusion on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.

McCartney asked Jan Vaughan, a French teacher and the wife of his old friend Ivan Vaughan, to come up with a French name and a phrase that rhymed with it. McCartney said: &quot;It was because I&#x27;d always thought that the song sounded French that I stuck with it. I can&#x27;t speak French properly so that&#x27;s why I needed help in sorting out the actual words.&quot;

Vaughan came up with &quot;Michelle, ma belle&quot;, and a few days later McCartney asked for a translation of &quot;these are words that go together well&quot;, rendered, for scansion, as &quot;sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble&quot; (&quot;are words that go very well together&quot;). When McCartney played the song for Lennon, Lennon suggested the &quot;I love you&quot; bridge. Lennon was inspired by a song he heard the previous evening, Nina Simone&#x27;s version of &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, which used the same phrase but with the emphasis on the last word, &quot;I love &quot;you&quot;&quot;.

Each version of this song has a different length. The UK mono mix is 2:33 whereas the stereo version extends to 2:40 and the US mono is 2:43. The version available in &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot; has a running time of 2:50.

== Musical structure ==

The song was initially composed in C, but was played in F on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (with a capo on the fifth fret). The verse opens with an F major chord (&quot;Michelle&quot; – melody note C) then the second chord (on &quot;ma belle&quot; – melody note D) is a B79 (on the original demo in C, the second chord is a F79). McCartney called this second chord a &quot;great ham-fisted jazz chord&quot; that was taught to them by Jim Gretty who worked at Hessey&#x27;s music shop in Whitechapel, central Liverpool and which George Harrison uses (as a G79) (see Dominant seventh sharp ninth chord) as the penultimate chord of his solo on &quot;Till There Was You&quot;. After the E6 (of &quot;these are words&quot;) there follows an ascent involving different inversions of the D dim chord. These progress from Adim on &quot;go&quot; – melody note F, bass note D; to Bdim (Cdim) on &quot;to&quot; – melody note A, bass note D; to Ddim on &quot;ge ...&quot; – melody note B (C) bass note B; to Bdim on ... &#x27;ther ...&quot; – melody note A bass note B, till the dominant (V) chord (C major) is reached on &quot;well&quot; – melody note G bass note C.

George Martin, the Beatles&#x27; producer, recalled that he composed the melody of the guitar solo, which is heard midway through the song and again during the fadeout. He showed Harrison the notes during the recording session and then accompanied the guitarist (on piano, out of microphone range) when the solos were overdubbed. In terms of its complementary role to the main melody, musicologist Walter Everett likens this guitar part to two musical passages that Martin had arranged for singer Cilla Black the previous year: a bassoon–English horn combination on &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot; and the baritone electric guitar on &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot;.

==Release==
EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label released &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; on 3 December 1965 in Britain, with &quot;Michelle&quot; sequenced as the final track on side one of the LP. The album was widely viewed as marking a significant progression within the Beatles&#x27; work and in the scope of pop music generally. Recalling the album&#x27;s release for &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine in 2002, Richard Williams said &quot;Michelle&quot; represented &quot;the biggest shock of all&quot; to a contemporary pop audience, as McCartney conveyed &quot;all his nostalgia for a safe childhood in the 1950s, itself a decade suffused with nostalgia for the inter-war security of the &#x27;20s and &#x27;30s, the era to which this song specifically refers.&quot;

Although no single from &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was issued in Britain or America, &quot;Michelle&quot; was the most popular &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; track on US radio. The song was released as a commercial single in several other countries. It topped charts in Italy (for eight weeks), the Netherlands (seven weeks), Sweden (five weeks), Denmark (four weeks) and Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand and Singapore. In May 1966, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hits of the World listed the song at number 1 in Argentina and Norway, among other countries. It was also number 1 in France (for five weeks) as the lead track on an EP release, since France continued to favour the extended-play format over singles.

At the 1967 Ivor Novello Awards, &quot;Michelle&quot; won in the category of &quot;the Most Performed Work&quot; of 1966, ahead of &quot;Yesterday&quot;. &quot;Michelle&quot; won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1967, against competition from &quot;Born Free&quot;, &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;, &quot;Somewhere My Love&quot; and &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;. In 1999, BMI named &quot;Michelle&quot; as the 42nd most performed song of the 20th century.

==Critical reception==
In a contemporary review for the &quot;NME&quot;, Allen Evans described &quot;Michelle&quot; as a &quot;memorable track&quot; with a &quot;bluesy French sound&quot; in which McCartney&#x27;s vocal was supported by &quot;[the] others using voices as instruments&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s reviewer admired the lyrics and said that the song was &quot;just remotely, faintly, slightly similar to &#x27;Yesterday&#x27; in the general approach&quot; and &quot;another stand-out performance&quot;. Eden of &quot;KRLA Beat&quot; described &quot;Michelle&quot; as a &quot;beautiful ballad&quot;, adding: &quot;Although it doesn&#x27;t sound at all like his fantastic &#x27;Yesterday&#x27;, it is another tender love song, sung as only Paul could sing it. He even croons the choruses in Frenchand what better language for a love song?&quot; Jazz critic and broadcaster Steve Race admitted being &quot;astonished&quot; by the album, and added &quot;When I heard &#x27;Michelle&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t believe my ears. The second chord is an A-chord, while the note in the melody above is A-flat. This is an unforgivable clash, something no one brought up knowing older music could ever have done. It is entirely unique, a stroke of genius... I suppose it was sheer musical ignorance that allowed John and Paul to do it, but it took incredible daring.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lydon/RBP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Beatles&#x27; peers, Bob Dylan, whose work was especially influential on Lennon and Harrison&#x27;s songwriting on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, was dismissive of McCartney&#x27;s ballad style. In March 1966, he said: &quot;A song like &#x27;Yesterday&#x27; or &#x27;Michelle&#x27;... it&#x27;s such a cop-out, man... if you go to the Library of Congress you can find a lot better than that. There are millions of songs like &#x27;Yesterday&#x27; and &#x27;Michelle&#x27; written in Tin Pan Alley.&quot; Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops, an American vocal group promoted in the UK by Beatles manager Brian Epstein, cited the song as an example of the sophistication the Beatles had introduced into pop music. He said that the US music scene had been &quot;very dead-beat&quot; and &quot;stagnant&quot; before the arrival of the British Invasion, after which: &quot;Good music became accepted. Would &#x27;Michelle&#x27; have been a hit before the Beatles? Of course not.&quot;

From 1970, McCartney&#x27;s standing among music critics suffered as the authentic rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll qualities personified by Lennon came to be valued over his former bandmate&#x27;s more eclectic tastes. In his 1979 essay on the Beatles in &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, Greil Marcus said that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the best of all the band&#x27;s LPs and that &quot;every cut was an inspiration, something new and remarkable in and of itself&quot; except &quot;Michelle&quot;, although he added, &quot;to be fair, [it] paid the bills for years to come&quot;.

==Cover versions==
&quot;Michelle&quot; was the most successful track from &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; for other recording artists and attracted dozens of cover versions within a year of its release. Author Peter Doggett lists it with &quot;Yesterday&quot; and several other Beatles compositions, mostly written by McCartney, that provided contemporary relevance for &quot;light orchestras and crooners&quot; in the easy listening category, persuaded adults that the new generation&#x27;s musical tastes had merit and, by becoming some of the most widely recorded songs of all time, &quot;ensured that Lennon and McCartney would become the highest-earning composers in history&quot;.

The song was a UK hit in January 1966 for the Overlanders, whose version topped the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart. It also reached number 2 in Australia. Signed to Pye Records, the Overlanders issued their recording after the Beatles had declined to release it as a single themselves in the United Kingdom and the United States. Pye and the Overlanders were given the Beatles&#x27; blessing because the record label had recently acquiesced to Epstein&#x27;s request that they withdraw a single by Lennon&#x27;s estranged father, Alf Lennon.

Bárbara y Dick had a hit in Argentina with the song which got in to the Argentine Top Ten in October 1966.

&quot;Michelle&quot; was also covered by David and Jonathan, whose version was produced by Martin. This recording went to number 1 in Canada and number 18 in the US, and was also a top 20 hit in Britain. Author Jon Savage writes that both the Overlanders&#x27; and David and Jonathan&#x27;s versions were &quot;mainstream pop songs, accentuating the very Beatles balladry that put off many hardcore fans&quot;; he says this added to a perception that the Beatles had become &quot;part of the Establishment&quot; after receiving their MBEs from Queen Elizabeth II in October 1965. The Beatles version was not released as a single in North America.

American singer Billy Vaughn was another artist who recorded the song soon after its release. In his comments on the Lennon–McCartney composition, Steve Race remarked that Vaughn&#x27;s arranger had altered the second chord to incorporate an A note, thereby &quot;taking all the sting out&quot; of the unorthodox change. Race said this was indicative of how a formally trained arranger &quot;was so attuned to the conventional way of thinking he didn&#x27;t even hear what the boys had done&quot;.

Andy Williams covered the song on his 1966 album &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot;. That same year, &quot;Michelle&quot; was one of Louis Andriessen&#x27;s &quot;Satirical Arrangements&quot; of Beatles songs for singer Cathy Berberian. American jazz singer Sarah Vaughan also covered the song, while Matt Monro recorded it in 1973 with a string quartet. Instrumental versions were released by the Ventures, using a clavinet over the solo; Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s; and French bandleader Paul Mauriat, whose interpretation author John Kruth describes as &quot;the most elegant Muzak version&quot; of the song.

Italian singer Mango released an a cappella rendition of &quot;Michelle&quot; on his 2002 album &quot;Disincanto&quot;. The band Rubblebucket covered the song in 2010, a trip hop version that was included on their &quot;Triangular Daisies&quot; EP. Beatallica did a cover of the song incorporating the music from &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; by Metallica. Titled &quot;For Whom Michelle Tolls&quot;, the track appeared on their 2013 album &quot;Abbey Load&quot;.

In 1973, jazz vocal group The Singers Unlimited released an acapella version of &quot;Michelle&quot;. This was later sampled in rap artist Masego&#x27;s &quot;Navajo&quot;. &quot;Navajo&quot;&#x27;s underlying instrumental was used in the 2021 song &quot;Champagne Poetry&quot; from Drake&#x27;s album &quot;Certified Lover Boy&quot;. 
Luther Vandross recorded a cover of &quot;Michelle&quot; in June 1989, and it remained unreleased until late 2024 for his greatest hits collection &quot;Never Too Much: Greatest Hits&quot; in conjunction of his documentary &quot;&quot;.

The title of &quot;Michelle&quot; inspired the title of the song &quot;Michèle&quot; by French singer Gérard Lenorman. Moreover, Lenorman&#x27;s song has been mistaken for a cover of the Beatles&#x27; song.

==McCartney live performances==

&quot;Michelle&quot; was performed by McCartney throughout his 1993 world tour. He has rarely performed the song since, but did include it in a 2009 performance in Washington, DC, in honour of Michelle Obama, the American First Lady, and he would play it on most (if not all) of his performances in France or other francophone countries.

On 2 June 2010, after being awarded the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song by President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House, McCartney performed the song for Michelle Obama, who sang along from her seat. McCartney quipped, &quot;I could be the first guy ever to be punched out by a president.&quot; Michelle Obama reportedly later told others that she could never have imagined, growing up an African-American girl on the South Side of Chicago, that someday a Beatle would sing &quot;Michelle&quot; to her as First Lady of the United States.

<text>Rigour (British English) or rigor (American English; see spelling differences) describes a condition of stiffness or strictness. These constraints may be environmentally imposed, such as &quot;the rigours of famine&quot;; logically imposed, such as mathematical proofs which must maintain consistent answers; or socially imposed, such as the process of defining ethics and law.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Rigour&quot; comes to English through old French (13th c., Modern French &quot;&quot;) meaning &quot;stiffness&quot;, which itself is based on the Latin &quot;rigorem&quot; (nominative &quot;rigor&quot;) &quot;numbness, stiffness, hardness, firmness; roughness, rudeness&quot;, from the verb &quot;rigere&quot; &quot;to be stiff&quot;. The noun was frequently used to describe a condition of strictness or stiffness, which arises from a situation or constraint either chosen or experienced passively. For example, the title of the book &quot;Theologia Moralis Inter Rigorem et Laxitatem Medi&quot; roughly translates as &quot;mediating theological morality between rigour and laxness&quot;. The book details, for the clergy, situations in which they are obligated to follow church law exactly, and in which situations they can be more forgiving yet still considered moral. &quot;Rigor mortis&quot; translates directly as the stiffness (&quot;rigor&quot;) of death (&quot;mortis&quot;), again describing a condition which arises from a certain constraint (death).

== Intellectualism ==
Intellectual rigour is a process of thought which is consistent, does not contain self-contradiction, and takes into account the entire scope of available knowledge on the topic. It actively avoids logical fallacy. Furthermore, it requires a sceptical assessment of the available knowledge. If a topic or case is dealt with in a rigorous way, it typically means that it is dealt with in a comprehensive, thorough and complete way, leaving no room for inconsistencies.

Scholarly method describes the different approaches or methods which may be taken to apply intellectual rigour on an institutional level to ensure the quality of information published. An example of intellectual rigour assisted by a methodical approach is the scientific method, in which a person will produce a hypothesis based on what they believe to be true, then construct experiments in order to prove that hypothesis wrong. This method, when followed correctly, helps to prevent against circular reasoning and other fallacies which frequently plague conclusions within academia. Other disciplines, such as philosophy and mathematics, employ their own structures to ensure intellectual rigour. Each method requires close attention to criteria for logical consistency, as well as to all relevant evidence and possible differences of interpretation. At an institutional level, peer review is used to validate intellectual rigour.

=== Honesty ===
Intellectual rigour is a subset of intellectual honesty—a practice of thought in which ones convictions are kept in proportion to valid evidence. Intellectual honesty is an unbiased approach to the acquisition, analysis, and transmission of ideas. A person is being intellectually honest when he or she, knowing the truth, states that truth, regardless of outside social/environmental pressures. It is possible to doubt whether complete intellectual honesty exists—on the grounds that no one can entirely master his or her own presuppositions—without doubting that certain kinds of intellectual rigour are potentially available. The distinction certainly matters greatly in debate, if one wishes to say that an argument is flawed in its premises.

== Politics and law ==
The setting for intellectual rigour does tend to assume a principled position from which to advance or argue. An opportunistic tendency to use any argument at hand is not very rigorous, although very common in politics, for example. Arguing one way one day, and another later, can be defended by casuistry, i.e. by saying the cases are different.

In the legal context, for practical purposes, the facts of cases do always differ. Case law can therefore be at odds with a principled approach; and intellectual rigour can seem to be defeated. This defines a judge&#x27;s problem with uncodified law. Codified law poses a different problem, of interpretation and adaptation of definite principles without losing the point; here applying the letter of the law, with all due rigour, may on occasion seem to undermine the &quot;principled approach&quot;.

== Mathematics ==

Mathematical rigour can apply to methods of mathematical proof and to methods of mathematical practice (thus relating to other interpretations of rigour).

=== Mathematical proof ===

Mathematical rigour is often cited as a kind of gold standard for mathematical proof. Its history traces back to Greek mathematics, especially to Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

Until the 19th century, Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; was seen as extremely rigorous and profound, but in the late 19th century, Hilbert (among others) realized that the work left certain assumptions implicit—assumptions that could not be proved from Euclid&#x27;s Axioms (e.g. two circles can intersect in a point, some point is within an angle, and figures can be superimposed on each other). This was contrary to the idea of rigorous proof where all assumptions need to be stated and nothing can be left implicit. New foundations were developed using the axiomatic method to address this gap in rigour found in the &quot;Elements&quot; (e.g., Hilbert&#x27;s axioms, Birkhoff&#x27;s axioms, Tarski&#x27;s axioms).

During the 19th century, the term &quot;rigorous&quot; began to be used to describe increasing levels of abstraction when dealing with calculus which eventually became known as mathematical analysis. The works of Cauchy added rigour to the older works of Euler and Gauss. The works of Riemann added rigour to the works of Cauchy. The works of Weierstrass added rigour to the works of Riemann, eventually culminating in the arithmetization of analysis. Starting in the 1870s, the term gradually came to be associated with Cantorian set theory.

Mathematical rigour can be modelled as amenability to algorithmic proof checking. Indeed, with the aid of computers, it is possible to check some proofs mechanically. Formal rigour is the introduction of high degrees of completeness by means of a formal language where such proofs can be codified using set theories such as ZFC (see automated theorem proving).

Published mathematical arguments have to conform to a standard of rigour, but are written in a mixture of symbolic and natural language. In this sense, written mathematical discourse is a prototype of formal proof. Often, a written proof is accepted as rigorous although it might not be formalised as yet. The reason often cited by mathematicians for writing informally is that completely formal proofs tend to be longer and more unwieldy, thereby obscuring the line of argument. An argument that appears obvious to human intuition may in fact require fairly long formal derivations from the axioms. A particularly well-known example is how in &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, Whitehead and Russell have to expend a number of lines of rather opaque effort in order to establish that, indeed, it is sensical to say: &quot;1+1=2&quot;. In short, comprehensibility is favoured over formality in written discourse.

Still, advocates of automated theorem provers may argue that the formalisation of proof does improve the mathematical rigour by disclosing gaps or flaws in informal written discourse. When the correctness of a proof is disputed, formalisation is a way to settle such a dispute as it helps to reduce misinterpretations or ambiguity.

=== Physics ===

The role of mathematical rigour in relation to physics is twofold:

# First, there is the general question, sometimes called &quot;Wigner&#x27;s Puzzle&quot;, &quot;how it is that mathematics, quite generally, is applicable to nature?&quot; Some scientists believe that its record of successful application to nature justifies the study of mathematical physics.
# Second, there is the question regarding the role and status of mathematically rigorous results and relations. This question is particularly vexing in relation to quantum field theory, where computations often produce infinite values for which a variety of non-rigorous work-arounds have been devised.

Both aspects of mathematical rigour in physics have attracted considerable attention in philosophy of science (see, for example, ref. and ref. and the works quoted therein).

== Education ==

Rigour in the classroom is a hotly debated topic amongst educators. Even the semantic meaning of the word is contested.

Generally speaking, classroom rigour consists of multi-faceted, challenging instruction and correct placement of the student. Students excelling in formal operational thought tend to excel in classes for gifted students. Students who have not reached that final stage of cognitive development, according to developmental psychologist Jean Piaget, can build upon those skills with the help of a properly trained teacher.

Rigour in the classroom is commonly called &quot;rigorous instruction&quot;. It is instruction that requires students to construct meaning for themselves, impose structure on information, integrate individual skills into processes, operate within but at the outer edge of their abilities, and apply what they learn in more than one context and to unpredictable situations.

<text>The Donnas were an American rock band formed in Palo Alto, California, in 1993. The band consisted of Brett Anderson (lead vocals), Allison Robertson (guitar, backing vocals), Maya Ford (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Torry Castellano (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Amy Cesari replaced Castellano, who left the band in 2009 due to tendonitis. They drew inspiration from the Ramones, the Runaways, Girlschool, AC/DC, Bachman–Turner Overdrive and Kiss. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has stated that &quot;the Donnas offer a guileless take on adolescent alienation; they traffic in kicks, not catharsis, fun rather than rage&quot;. MTV has stated that the band offers &quot;a good old-fashioned rock &amp; roll party&quot;.

After gathering a cult following in the punk scene since their 1997 debut, the band achieved major label commercial success in the early 2000s and afterward as their music mixed punk, metal and classic rock sounds.

==History==
===Origins and early years: 1993–2001===
All four founding band members were born in 1979. Lead vocalist Brett Anderson on May 30; guitarist Allison Robertson on August 26; bassist Maya Ford and drummer Torry Castellano, both on January 8. They all became friends by eighth grade and formed as a band in May 1993 to play for their school&#x27;s &quot;Day on the Green.&quot; One of two all-female bands in their town Palo Alto, California, they were relatively unknown until they were out of high school. They are all self-taught musicians and practiced in Castellano&#x27;s garage nearly every day during their years at Palo Alto High School. They called themselves &quot;Ragady Anne&quot; in their early days and shortly thereafter changed their name to &quot;The Electrocutes&quot;.

Towards the end of their high school days, while they were still known as the Electrocutes, they decided to create another band (with the same members) that would play softer tunes without distorting the metal queen image of the Electrocutes. To help their fans distinguish between the two bands, they all took matching &quot;Donna&quot; monikers, where all of their names were Donna and their last names were the first initial of their last name (Brett Anderson became Donna A, etc.), which they used only when performing as &quot;The Donnas.&quot;

They worked with producer Darin Raffaelli for their first two albums, the first of which, simply called &quot;The Donnas&quot;, was released on Raffaelli&#x27;s Super*teem! record label. (It was later released again on Lookout! Records.) They took a week off their senior year of high school to tour Japan as The Donnas, and were promoted and organized by of . Afterwards, they signed with Lookout! Records. As the band grew, they were urged to sign with a major label company. In December 2001, they signed with Atlantic Records.

===Atlantic Records: 2002–2005===
In 2002, the Donnas released &quot;Spend the Night&quot; as their Atlantic debut. The album represented their first attempt at mainstream success. With their single &quot;Take it Off&quot; they were booked for appearances on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. In the summer of 2003, they played the main stage at Lollapalooza. In 2004, they released their sixth album &quot;Gold Medal&quot;. In February 2005, they toured Australia with the Big Day Out music festival, playing from Sydney to Perth. While in Australia they performed &quot;Take It Off&quot; live on national prime-time show &quot;Rove Live&quot; with Rove McManus. 

Atlantic repeatedly placed the Donnas&#x27; music in video game soundtracks. &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Crush On Me&quot; can be heard in the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Splashdown&quot;. &quot;Who Invited You&quot; can be found on the soundtracks for &quot;True Crime: Streets of LA&quot; and &quot;MVP Baseball 2003&quot; as well as . &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Know&quot; is in the &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; soundtrack also and a cover of the song was also used for &quot;Donkey Konga 2&quot; for the GameCube. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Know&quot; was also used as the theme song for the first season of The-N&#x27;s hit series, &quot;South of Nowhere&quot;. A cover of &quot;Take it Off&quot; is featured in &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and added as a downloadable track in &quot;Guitar Hero 2&quot; on the Xbox 360 (released in 2006) and &quot;Downhill Domination&quot; (released in 2004). &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; (for the PS3, Xbox 360 &amp; Wii), released by Harmonix in 2008, features the track &quot;New Kid In School&quot; which was released exclusively on Apples iTunes service. &quot;Fall Behind Me&quot; was also used in a national television commercial advertising the Nissan Xterra while Take It Off was used in a Budweiser commercial.

Atlantic also energetically marketed the Donnas through placements in numerous film soundtracks. The band appeared in the movie &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot; in 1999 (as The Electrocutes), and later on the TV show &quot;Charmed&quot; performing the single &quot;Fall Behind Me&quot; at P3. They also appeared in the 1999 teen comedy &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; as the prom band, contributing two songs to the soundtrack (&quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Machine&quot; and &quot;Checkin&#x27; It Out&quot;). A cover of &quot;Roll On Down The Highway&quot; was used in the Disney comedy film &quot;&quot; and Backstage was used in &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;. The Donnas can also be heard on &quot;Mean Girls&quot; during the end credits playing a cover of the Billy Idol song &quot;Dancing With Myself&quot;, and they also contributed to the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Grind&quot;. The video &quot;Too Bad About Your Girl&quot; also features the cast of that film. The song &quot;Take It Off&quot; features in the movie &quot;&quot;. The song &quot;Take Me To The Backseat&quot; can be heard in the action comedy film 2004 &quot;D.E.B.S.&quot;. A cover version of the Kiss song &quot;Strutter&quot; was used in the soundtrack to the 1999 movie &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;. &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Tease&quot; was used in &quot;New York Minute&quot; and &quot;Everyone Is Wrong &quot; was featured in the movie &quot;Elektra&quot;. Then Guitar Hero used &quot;Take It Off&quot; for 2009 Guitar Hero Smash Hits. &quot;Take It Off&quot; was also used in the 2009 hit movie &quot;The Hangover&quot;. &quot;Play My Game&quot; was featured in a Season 1 episode of &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby Doo?&quot;. &quot;Who Invited You&quot; is featured on the soundtrack of the 2003 movie &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot;.

===New label, lineup change and dissolution: 2006–2012===
On May 19, 2006, the Donnas announced on their public message board that they had &quot;parted ways with Atlantic Records,&quot; claiming &quot;[t]he decision was entirely mutual and completely amicable and will not impact the band, nor will it impact upon the writing, recording or touring for the next Donnas album.&quot;
In March 2007, the Donnas released a single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait Up For Me,&quot; and had a new band logo designed.

The Donnas independently released their seventh studio album titled &quot;Bitchin&#x27;&quot; on September 18, 2007 Purple Feather Records label. &quot;Bitchin&quot;&#x27; was produced by Jay Ruston and The Donnas and contained the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait Up For Me&quot;.

In 2008, the Donnas toured with the Melbourne-based, Australian band Kisschasy as part of their Skin and Bones tour. They also toured the U.S. and Canada with The Hives.

In July 2009, the band released a retrospective collection titled &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 16&quot; to celebrate the band&#x27;s 16th year together. The album contained new songs, re-recorded older songs as well as some unreleased material. The band toured that summer with Pat Benatar and Blondie on the two&#x27;s joint Call Me Invincible Tour. Drummer Torry Castellano was unable to play on any of these tour dates as she was suffering from tendonitis of the shoulder, which was accredited to the fact that as a self-taught drummer she had held the drumsticks incorrectly (even though it felt right to her) and sustained long term damage over time. Long-time friend Amy Cesari of the Demonics has been chosen to fill in for Castellano.

On July 9, 2010, Castellano announced via the band&#x27;s website that due to her continued shoulder problems she would have to retire from drumming and performing with the Donnas. She returned to school at Santa Monica College and then Stanford University, where she graduated in 2013 and went on to Harvard Law School. She is currently an attorney working at the Texas Office of Capital and Forensic Writs (OCFW) which serves as a post-conviction public defender.

In August 2012, the band was reported to be recording their eighth studio album and also premiered a new song called &quot;Tramp&quot; at a private show.

In November 2016 Cherry Red Records re-released the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Spend the Night&quot;, to include six bonus tracks which consist of B-sides and songs from previous albums.

In an interview from 2017, the band&#x27;s lead vocalist, Brett Anderson, discussed &quot;the end of the band&quot; and turning down offers to &quot;reunite,&quot; implicitly confirming the band is no more. In the same interview, she also mentions that there are no plans to release previously-unreleased studio-recorded songs.

In April 2023, for Record Store Day, the band released a compilation of earlier material entitled &quot;The Donnas - Early Singles 1995-1999&quot;.

<text>A cromlech (sometimes also spelled &quot;cromleh&quot; or &quot;cromlêh&quot;; cf Welsh &quot;crom&quot;, &quot;bent&quot;; &quot;llech&quot;, &quot;slate&quot;) is a megalithic construction made of large stone blocks. The word applies to two different megalithic forms in English, the first being an (frequently called a &quot;dolmen&quot;), as William Borlase first denoted in 1769. A good example is at . The second meaning of the name &quot;cromlech&quot; in English refers to large stone circles such as those found among the Carnac stones in Brittany, France.

Unlike in English, the word &quot;cromlech&quot; in many other languages (such as Azerbaijani, Armenian, French, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Romanian, and Spanish) exclusively denotes a megalithic stone circle, whereas the word &quot;dolmen&quot; is used to refer to the type of megalithic altar tomb sometimes indicated by the English &quot;cromlech&quot;. Also, more recently in English, scholars such as Aubrey Burl use &quot;cromlech&quot; as a synonym for &quot;megalithic stone circle&quot;.

<text>The Tailhook Association is a U.S.-based non-profit organization supporting the interests of sea-based aviation, with emphasis on aircraft carriers. The word tailhook refers to the hook underneath the tail of the aircraft that catches the arresting wire suspended across the flight deck in order to stop the landing plane quickly.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===
The Tailhook Association was formed by active-duty naval aviators in 1956, eventually growing into a national organization headquartered in San Diego, California. During the Vietnam War, the annual Tailhook reunion and symposium also served to provide opportunities for aircrews from the Pacific and Atlantic Fleets to exchange information about events in Southeast Asia. The association evolved into an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to building camaraderie among those that have been a part of the Naval Aviation team. The purpose of the association is to foster, encourage, develop, study and support the aircraft carrier and sea-based aircraft and aircrews.

The Tailhook Educational Foundation (TEF) was created in 1992 to educate the nation&#x27;s public with regard to the history and present day activities of the US Navy carrier aviation community. TEF is a separate non-profit that works closely with, and in support of, the Tailhook Association, providing over 100 scholarships per year to Naval Aviation legacies.

=== The Tailhook scandal ===
In September 1991, the 35th annual symposium in Las Vegas featured a two-day debriefing on Navy and Marine Corps aviation in Operation Desert Storm. It was the largest such meeting yet held, with 4,000 attendees including active, reserve, and retired personnel. According to a Department of Defense (DoD) report, 83 women and 7 men stated that they had been victims of sexual assault and harassment during the meeting. Several participants later stated that a number of flag officers attending the meetings were aware of the sexual assaults, but did nothing to stop them.

The issues were never settled, and as late as 2002, the Tailhook chairman spoke dismissively of &quot;the alleged misconduct that occurred in 1991&quot;.

Frontline on PBS reported:

Ultimately the careers of fourteen admirals and almost 300 naval aviators were scuttled or damaged by Tailhook. For example, Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett III and CNO Admiral Frank Kelso were both at Tailhook &#x27;91. Garrett ultimately resigned and Kelso retired early two years after the convention.
Author Jean Zimmerman developed the thesis that the scandal underscored the shifting status of women in the US military and particularly the role of women in combat.

== Activities ==
Among the Tailhook programs are publication of the quarterly journal &quot;The Hook&quot;, addressing historical and current events coverage; college scholarships via the Tailhook Educational Foundation; and local/regional &quot;ready rooms&quot; for active and retired members who support fleet activities.

Some visitors to US Navy aircraft carriers who joined or left the ship on a Carrier Onboard Delivery aircraft are issued &quot;Tailhook certificates&quot; by the Navy, commending them for &quot; and intestinal fortitude.&quot;

== Awards ==
===James D. &quot;Jig Dog&quot; Ramage Award===

===Tailhooker Of The Year Award===
Yearly award given to an individual who has made the most significant contribution to U.S. carrier aviation.

===Lifetime Achievement Award===

===The Hook Magazine Contributor of the Year===

===Honorary Tailhooker of the Year===
(Sponsored by the Boeing Company)

<doc id="655989" wikidata="Q310956" url="?curid=655989" title="Clifford Geertz">
<text>Clifford James Geertz (; August 23, 1926 – October 30, 2006) was an American anthropologist who is remembered mostly for his strong support for and influence on the practice of symbolic anthropology and who was considered &quot;for three decades... the single most influential cultural anthropologist in the United States.&quot; He served until his death as professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.

==Life and career==
Born in San Francisco on August 23, 1926, Geertz served in the US Navy in World War II from 1943 to 1945. He received a bachelor of arts in philosophy from Antioch College at Yellow Springs, Ohio in 1950 and a doctor of philosophy in anthropology from Harvard University in 1956.

At Harvard University he studied in the Department of Social Relations with an interdisciplinary program led by Talcott Parsons. Geertz worked with Parsons, as well as with Clyde Kluckhohn, and was trained as an anthropologist. Geertz conducted his first long-term fieldwork together with his wife, Hildred, in Java, Indonesia, in a project funded by the Ford Foundation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There he studied the religious life of the small, upcountry town of Mojokuto for two-and-a-half years (1952 to 1954), living with a railroad laborer&#x27;s family. After finishing his thesis, Geertz returned to Indonesia, visiting Bali and Sumatra, after which he would receive his PhD in 1956 with a dissertation entitled &quot;Religion in Modjokuto: A Study of Ritual Belief In A Complex Society&quot;.

In the course of his career, Geertz received honorary doctorate degrees from around fifteen colleges and universities, including Harvard, Cambridge, and the University of Chicago; as well as awards such as the Association for Asian Studies&#x27; (AAS) 1987 Award for Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies. He became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, of the American Philosophical Society, and of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Following his divorce from anthropologist Hildred Geertz, his first wife, he married Karen Blu, another anthropologist.

=== Teaching ===
Geertz taught or held fellowships at a number of schools before joining the faculty of the anthropology department at the University of Chicago in 1960. In this period he expanded his focus on Indonesia to include both Java and Bali and produced three books, including &quot;Religion of Java&quot; (1960), &quot;Agricultural Involution&quot; (1963), and &quot;Peddlers and Princes&quot; (also 1963). In the mid-1960s, he shifted course and began a new research project in Morocco that resulted in several publications, including &quot;Islam Observed&quot; (1968), which compared Indonesia and Morocco.

In 1970, Geertz left Chicago to become professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey from 1970 to 2000, an subsequently as emeritus professor. In 1973 he published &quot;The Interpretation of Cultures&quot;, which collected essays he had published throughout the 1960s. That became Geertz&#x27;s best-known book and established him not just as an Indonesianist but also as an anthropological theorist. In 1974, he edited the anthology &quot;Myth, Symbol, Culture&quot; that contained papers by many important anthropologists on symbolic anthropology. Geertz produced ethnographic pieces in this period, such as &quot;Kinship in Bali&quot; (1975), &quot;Meaning and Order in Moroccan Society&quot; (1978; written collaboratively with Hildred Geertz and Lawrence Rosen) and &quot;Negara&quot; (1981).

===Later life===
From the 1980s to his death, Geertz wrote more theoretical and essayistic pieces, including book reviews for the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;. As a result, most of his books of the period are collections of essays—books including &quot;Local Knowledge&quot; (1983), &quot;Available Light&quot; (2000), and &quot;Life Among The Anthros&quot; (2010), which was published posthumously. He also produced a series of short essays on the stylistics of ethnography in &quot;Works and Lives&quot; (1988), while other works include the autobiographical &quot;After The Fact&quot; (1995).

Geertz conducted extensive ethnographic research in Southeast Asia and North Africa. This fieldwork was the basis of Geertz&#x27;s famous analysis of the Balinese cockfight among others. While holding a position in Chicago in the 1960s, he directed a multidisciplinary project titled &quot;Committee for the Comparative Studies of New Nations&quot;. As part of the project, Geertz conducted fieldwork in Morocco on &quot;bazaars, mosques, olive growing and oral poetry,&quot; collecting ethnographic data that would be used for his famous essay on thick description.

Geertz contributed to social and cultural theory and remains influential in turning anthropology toward a concern with the frames of meaning within which various peoples live their lives. He reflected on the basic core notions of anthropology, such as culture and ethnography. 

He died of complications following heart surgery on October 30, 2006. At the time of his death, Geertz was working on the general question of ethnic diversity and its implications in the modern world. He was remembered by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;the eminent cultural anthropologist whose work focused on interpreting the symbols he believed give meaning and order to people’s lives.&quot;

== Main ideas, contributions, and influences ==

Geertz&#x27;s often-cited essay &quot;Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight&quot; is a classic example of thick description, a concept adopted from the British philosopher Gilbert Ryle which comes from ordinary language philosophy. &quot;Thick description&quot; is an anthropological method of explaining with as much detail as possible the reason behind human actions. Many human actions can mean many different things, and Geertz insisted that the anthropologist needs to be aware of this. The work proved influential amongst historians, many of whom tried to use these ideas about the &#x27;meaning&#x27; of cultural practice in the study of customs and traditions of the past.

Another of Geertz&#x27;s philosophical influences is that of Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s post-Tractatus philosophy, from which Geertz incorporates the concept of family resemblances into anthropology. Geertz would also introduce anthropology to the &quot;umwelt-mitwelt-vorwelt-folgewelt&quot; formulation of Alfred Schütz&#x27;s phenomenology, stressing that the links between the &quot;consociate&quot;, &quot;contemporary&quot;, &quot;predecessor&quot;, and &quot;successor&quot; that are commonplace in anthropology derive from this very formulation.

At the University of Chicago, Geertz became a champion of symbolic anthropology, a framework which gives prime attention to the role of symbols in constructing public meaning. In his seminal work &quot;The Interpretation of Cultures&quot; (1973), Geertz outlined culture as &quot;a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life.&quot;

He was one of the earliest scholars to see that the insights provided by common language, philosophy and literary analysis could have major explanatory force in the social sciences. Geertz aimed to provide the social sciences with an understanding and appreciation of “thick description.” Geertz applied thick description to anthropological studies, particularly to his own &#x27;interpretive anthropology&#x27;, urging anthropologists to consider the limitations placed upon them by their own cultural cosmologies when attempting to offer insight into the cultures of other people. He produced theory that had implications for other social sciences; for example, Geertz asserted that culture was essentially semiotic in nature, and this theory has implications for comparative political sciences.

Max Weber and his interpretative social science are strongly present in Geertz&#x27;s work. Drawing from Weber, Geertz himself argues for a “semiotic” concept of culture:Believing…that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun…I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretative one in search of meaning. It is explication I am after, construing social expression on their surface enigmatical. (p. 5)Geertz argues that to interpret a culture&#x27;s web of symbols, scholars must first isolate its elements, specifying the internal relationships among those elements and characterize the whole system in some general way according to the core symbols around which it is organized, the underlying structures of which it is a surface expression, or the ideological principles upon which it is based. It was his view that culture is public, because “meaning is,” and systems of meanings are what produce culture, because they are the collective property of a particular people. We cannot discover the culture&#x27;s import or understand its systems of meaning, when, as Wittgenstein noted, “we cannot find our feet with them.” Geertz wants society to appreciate that social actions are larger than themselves:

It is not against a body of uninterrupted data, radically thinned descriptions, that we must measure the cogency of our explications, but against the power of the scientific imagination to bring us into touch with the lives of strangers. (p. 18) 

Seeking to converse with subjects in foreign cultures and gain access to their conceptual world is the goal of the semiotic approach to culture. Cultural theory is not its own master; at the end of the day we must appreciate, that the generality “thick description” contrives to achieve, grows out of the delicacy of its distinctions, not the sweep of its abstraction. The essential task of theory-building here is not to codify abstract regularities, but to make thick description possible; not to generalize across cases, but to generalize within them.

During Geertz&#x27;s long career he worked through a variety of theoretical phases and schools of thought. He would reflect an early leaning toward functionalism in his essay &quot;Ethos, Worldview and the Analysis of Sacred Symbols&quot;, writing that &quot;the drive to make sense out of experience, to give it form and order, is evidently as real and pressing as the more familiar biological needs.&quot;

==Legacy==
Geertz&#x27;s research and ideas have had a strong influence on 20th-century academia, including modern anthropology and communication studies, as well as for geographers, ecologists, political scientists, scholars of religion, historians, and other humanists.

University of Miami Professor Daniel Pals (1996) wrote of Geertz that &quot;his critics are few; his admirers legion.&quot; Talal Asad attacked the dualism in Geertzian theory: the theory does not provide a bridge between external symbols and internal dispositions. Asad also pointed out the need for a more nuanced approach toward the historical background of certain concepts. Criticizing Geertz&#x27;s theory of religion in general, Asad pointed out a gap between &#x27;cultural system&#x27; and &#x27;social reality&#x27; when attempting to define the concept of religion in universal terms. He would also criticize Geertz for ascribing an authorizing discourse around conversations of comparative religion that, Asad argues, does not really exist. Furthermore, Asad criticized Geertz for operating according to a eurocentric view of religion that places import on signs and symbols that may or may not carry through in non-Christian religious cultures.

<text>Reperfusion injury, sometimes called ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) or reoxygenation injury, is the tissue damage caused when blood supply returns to tissue (&quot;&quot; + &quot;perfusion&quot;) after a period of ischemia or lack of oxygen (anoxia or hypoxia). The absence of oxygen and nutrients from blood during the ischemic period creates a condition in which the restoration of circulation results in inflammation and oxidative damage through the induction of oxidative stress rather than (or along with) restoration of normal function.

Reperfusion injury is distinct from cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (sometimes called &quot;Reperfusion syndrome&quot;), a state of abnormal cerebral vasodilation.

==Mechanisms==
Reperfusion of ischemic tissues is often associated with microvascular injury, particularly due to increased permeability of capillaries and arterioles that lead to an increase of diffusion and fluid filtration across the tissues. Activated endothelial cells produce more reactive oxygen species but less nitric oxide following reperfusion, and the imbalance results in a subsequent inflammatory response.
The inflammatory response is partially responsible for the damage of reperfusion injury. White blood cells, carried to the area by the newly returning blood, release a host of inflammatory factors such as interleukins as well as free radicals in response to tissue damage. The restored blood flow reintroduces oxygen within cells that damages cellular proteins, DNA, and the plasma membrane. Damage to the cell&#x27;s membrane may in turn cause the release of more free radicals. Such reactive species may also act indirectly in redox signaling to turn on apoptosis. White blood cells may also bind to the endothelium of small capillaries, obstructing them and leading to more ischemia.

Reperfusion injury plays a major part in the biochemistry of hypoxic brain injury in stroke. Similar failure processes are involved in brain failure following reversal of cardiac arrest; control of these processes is the subject of ongoing research. Repeated bouts of ischemia and reperfusion injury also are thought to be a factor leading to the formation and failure to heal of chronic wounds such as pressure sores and diabetic foot ulcer. Continuous pressure limits blood supply and causes ischemia, and the inflammation occurs during reperfusion. As this process is repeated, it eventually damages tissue enough to cause a wound.

The main reason for the acute phase of ischemia-reperfusion injury is oxygen deprivation and, therefore, arrest of generation of ATP (cellular energy currency) by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation. Tissue damage due to the general energy deficit during ischemia is followed by reperfusion (increase of oxygen level) when the injury is enhanced. Mitochondrial complex I is thought to be the most vulnerable enzyme to tissue ischemia/reperfusion but the mechanism of damage is different in different tissues. For example brain ischemia/reperfusion injury is mediated via complex I redox-dependent inactivation. It was found that lack of oxygen leads to conditions in which mitochondrial complex I loses its natural cofactor, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and become inactive. When oxygen is present the enzyme catalyzes a physiological reaction of NADH oxidation by ubiquinone, supplying electrons downstream of the respiratory chain (complexes III and IV). Ischemia leads to dramatic increase of succinate level. In the presence of succinate mitochondria catalyze reverse electron transfer so that fraction of electrons from succinate is directed upstream to FMN of complex I. Reverse electron transfer results in a reduction of complex I FMN, increased generation of ROS, followed by a loss of the reduced cofactor (FMNH2) and impairment of mitochondria energy production. The FMN loss by complex I and I/R injury can be alleviated by the administration of FMN precursor, riboflavin.

Reperfusion can cause hyperkalemia.

Reperfusion injury is a primary concern in liver transplantation surgery.

==Treatment==
===Therapeutic hypothermia===
The therapeutic effect of hypothermia is not confined to metabolism and membrane stability. Hypothermia can also prevent the injuries that occur after circulation returns to the brain, or what is termed injuries. In fact, an individual suffering from an ischemic insult continues suffering injuries well after circulation is restored. In rats, it has been shown that neurons often die a full 24 hours after blood flow returns. Some theorize that this delayed reaction derives from the various inflammatory immune responses that occur during reperfusion. These inflammatory responses cause intracranial pressure, pressure which leads to cell injury and in some situations cell death. Hypothermia has been shown to help moderate intracranial pressure and therefore to minimize the harmful effect of a patient&#x27;s inflammatory immune responses during reperfusion. Beyond this, reperfusion also increases free radical production. Hypothermia too has been shown to minimize a patient&#x27;s production of deadly free radicals during reperfusion. Many now suspect it is because hypothermia reduces both intracranial pressure and free radical production that hypothermia improves patient outcome following a blockage of blood flow to the brain.

===Hydrogen sulfide treatment===
There are some preliminary studies in mice that seem to indicate that treatment with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can have a protective effect against reperfusion injury.

===Cyclosporin===
In addition to its well-known immunosuppressive capabilities, the one-time administration of cyclosporin at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been found to deliver a 40 percent reduction in infarct size in a small group proof of concept study of human patients with reperfusion injury published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2008.

Cyclosporin has been confirmed in studies to inhibit the actions of cyclophilin D, a protein which is induced by excessive intracellular calcium flow to interact with other pore components and help open the MPT pore. Inhibiting cyclophilin D has been shown to prevent the opening of the MPT pore and protect the mitochondria and cellular energy production from excessive calcium inflows.

However, the studies CIRCUS and CYCLE (published in September 2015 and February 2016 respectively) looked at the use of cyclosporin as a one time IV dose given right before perfusion therapy (PCI). Both studies found there is no statistical difference in outcome with cyclosporin administration.

Reperfusion leads to biochemical imbalances within the cell that lead to cell death and increased infarct size. More specifically, calcium overload and excessive production of reactive oxygen species in the first few minutes after reperfusion set off a cascade of biochemical changes that result in the opening of the so-called mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPT pore) in the mitochondrial membrane of cardiac cells.

The opening of the MPT pore leads to the inrush of water into the mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and collapse. Upon collapse, the calcium is then released to overwhelm the next mitochondria in a cascading series of events that cause mitochondrial energy production supporting the cell to be reduced or stopped completely. The cessation of energy production results in cellular death. Protecting mitochondria is a viable cardioprotective strategy.

In 2008, an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine called for more studies to determine if cyclosporin can become a treatment to ameliorate reperfusion injury by protecting mitochondria. To that end, in 2011 the researchers involved in the original 2008 NEJM study initiated a phase III clinical study of reperfusion injury in 1000 myocardial infarction patients in centers throughout Europe. Results of that study were announced in 2015 and indicated that &quot;intravenous cyclosporine did not result in better clinical outcomes than those with placebo and did not prevent adverse left ventricular remodeling at 1 year.&quot;
This same process of mitochondrial destruction through the opening of the MPT pore is implicated in making traumatic brain injuries much worse.

===TRO40303===

TRO40303 is a new cardioprotective compound that was shown to inhibit the MPT pore and reduce infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion. It was developed by Trophos company and currently is in Phase I clinical trial.

===Stem cell therapy===

Recent investigations suggest a possible beneficial effect of mesenchymal stem cells on heart and kidney reperfusion injury.

=== Superoxide dismutase ===
Superoxide dismutase is an effective anti-oxidant enzyme which converts superoxide anions to water and hydrogen peroxide. Recent researches have shown significant therapeutic effects on pre-clinical models of reperfusion injury after ischemic stroke.

=== Metformin ===
A series of 2009 studies published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology suggest that Metformin may prevent cardiac reperfusion injury by inhibition of Mitochondrial Complex I and the opening of MPT pore and in rats.

=== Riboflavin ===
In neonatal in vivo model of brain ischemia/reperfusion, tissue injury can be alleviated by the administration of FMN precursor, riboflavin that prevents inactivation of mitochondrial complex I.

=== Cannabinoids ===
A study published in 2012 show that the synthetic analogue of the phytocannabinoid Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), Δ8-Tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ8-THCV) and its metabolite 11-OH-Δ8-THCV, prevent hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses through cannabinoid CB2 receptors and thereby decrease tissue injury and inflammation with a protective effect against liver damage. Pretreatment with a CB2 receptor antagonist attenuated the protective effects of Δ8-THCV, while a CB1 antagonist tended to enhance it.

An earlier study published in 2011 found, that Cannabidiol (CBD) also protects against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury by attenuating inflammatory signaling and response of oxidative and nitrative stress, and thereby cell death and tissue injury, but independent from classical CB1 and CB2 receptors.

==Reperfusion protection in obligate hibernators==
Obligatory hibernators such as the ground squirrels show resistance to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in liver, heart, and small intestine during the hibernation season when there is a switch from carbohydrate metabolism to lipid metabolism for cellular energy supply. This metabolic switch limits anaerobic metabolism and the formation of lactate, a herald of poor prognosis and multi-organ failure (MOF) after I/R injury. In addition, the increase in lipid metabolism generates ketone bodies and activates peroxisome proliferating-activated receptors (PPARs), both of which have been shown to be protective against I/R injury.

<text>Big Coppitt Key is an island in Monroe County, Florida, United States, in the lower Florida Keys. The name is said to be a derivation of the old English word &quot;coppice&quot;, meaning thicket. According to A.D. Bache, in the notes for his coast survey conducted in 1861, this key was the location of Happy Jack&#x27;s plantation in 1855.

==Geography==
Big Coppitt Key is located at (24.597677, -81.656546).

U.S. 1 (the Overseas Highway) crosses the key at approximately mile markers 9.5-11, between East Rockland Key and the Saddlebunch Keys.

==About the island==
There are several businesses on Big Coppitt Key. There is also a Monroe County Fire/Rescue Station located on the island. Law enforcement services are handled by the Monroe County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. There are three churches located on Big Coppitt Key. The key features three parks, including one with a playground and another with a basketball court, in the avenues section. A cemetery is located at Avenue A and 4th Street.

In 2005, Hurricane Wilma caused catastrophic damage to the island; many structures were either destroyed or rendered almost uninhabitable due to flood damage.

More recently, in 2017, Hurricane Irma caused similarly catastrophic damage; most homes were left uninhabitable due to severe wind and water damage. However, damage to the island&#x27;s world-famous Bobalu&#x27;s Southern Cafe was light because of proper preparation. They boarded up their windows and took in their outdoor furniture and signs, saving the landmark.

<text>Xeronema is a genus of flowering plants containing two species, &quot;Xeronema moorei&quot; from New Caledonia, and &quot;Xeronema callistemon&quot; (the Poor Knights lily) from the Poor Knights Islands and Taranga Island in New Zealand. The plants are herbaceous monocots, spreading by rhizomes, and have large flowers set on terminal spikes, with stamens towering above the flowers.

The type species &quot;X. moorei&quot; is found in the mountains of New Caledonia.

The Poor Knights lily (&quot;X. callistemon&quot;) is endemic to the Poor Knights Islands and Taranga Island in the north of New Zealand. It was discovered in 1924. The Poor Knights lily has large bottlebrush flower clusters that grow horizontally. The clusters begin growing vertically and then bend sideways. Bright red flowers grow upward from the stalk, with bright orange pollen. The plant can reach a height of one metre tall and across.

The APG IV system, of 2016, accepts this genus as constituting its own family Xeronemataceae. It places this in the order Asparagales, in the clade monocots. The family can be separated from other Asparagales families on DNA evidence; it is related to Asphodelaceae but differs in having uniformly unifacial leaves like Iridaceae.

<text>The court cairn or court tomb is a megalithic type of chambered cairn or gallery grave. During the period, 3900–3500 BC, more than 390 court cairns were built in Ireland and over 100 in southwest Scotland. The Neolithic (New Stone Age) monuments are identified by an uncovered courtyard connected to one or more roofed and partitioned burial chambers. Many monuments were built in multiple phases in both Ireland and Scotland and later re-used in the Early Bronze Age.

==Construction and design==

Court cairns are characterized as having an uncovered courtyard area connected to one or more covered burial chambers. The boundaries of this open area were typically lined with large standing stones. A narrow, stone lined entry extended from the main area into one or more roofed burial chambers. Courtyards were generally oval or circular in shape, with U-shaped and semi-circular courtyards being the most common layout. Large, standing stones were used to make the walls and roof of burial chambers, normally located at one end of the cairn. Burial chambers are typically divided by jamb stones or jamb and sill stones into consecutive burial compartments.

There are variations in the court cairn layout in both Ireland and Scotland. Most examples have a single courtyard connected by one burial tomb or a courtyard connected to two burial tombs, located on opposite ends of the court area. In Ireland, there are also instances of layouts with dual tombs, each with their own courtyard, but both sharing a common burial mound. The court cairn is also found in Western Scotland. The similar layout of tombs found in Ireland and Scotland and the close geographical location of these tombs, separated by the narrow Irish Channel, indicates that these populations moved back and forth on a regular basis between the two countries.

==History==
The earliest megalithic tombs found in Britain, Scotland and Ireland were constructed in early 4th millennium BC. The first burial monuments in these areas were most likely single chamber dolmens surrounded by large standing stones. A few dolmens can be dated in both Wales and Ireland from 3800 to 3500 BC. During the same period, passage graves were being developed throughout Ireland, southwest Britain, the Hebrides and the Orkney Islands. Court cairns are unique to Ireland and Scotland. 
Radiocarbon dating indicates that the earliest court cairns were built around 3750 and new monuments continued to be built and existing ones enlarged until 2900 BC.

===Court cairns in Ireland===
There are over 390 court cairns recorded in Ireland, with a majority of monuments found in the northern third of the island. Irish court cairns have a few variations in layout. Most examples have a single courtyard connected by one burial tomb chamber or a single courtyard connected to a single burial tomb on each end. In Ireland, there are also instances of layouts with dual tombs, each with their own courtyard, but both share a common burial mound and centre court tombs. Most tombs in Ireland are positioned facing east. Less than 40 tombs have been fully excavated to date, and at the majority of sites, at least one cremated individual has been found. In the Audsleystown dual court tomb in County Down, Ireland, the remains of 34 people were found in the burial chamber.

Court cairns are found north of a line crossing Ireland from the Burren to the Cooley peninsula. Court cairns are scattered densely across this area of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Thirty percent of all Irish neolithic monuments are court cairns. The court cairn at Creevykeel in County Sligo was the first court cairn to be excavated in Ireland by archaeologists from Harvard University in 1935. They determined that the Neolithic era in Ireland began in 3900 BC, more than 100 years before the first appearance of court tombs. They also suggested that court tombs were widely re-used during the Early Bronze Age. Excavations of court tombs yielded deposits of cremated and unburnt human bone, round bottomed bowls flat, bottomed pottery vessels, flint, polished axes and stone beads.

===Court cairns in Scotland===

Burial tombs in Scotland are known as Clyde cairns or Clyde-Carlingford cairns. Generally considered to be the earliest chambered cairns in Scotland, more than 100 Clyde cairns have been found to date. The &quot;Clyde&quot; name is derived from the first discovery of courtyard type burial monuments in the Firth of Clyde region of southwest Scotland. The ancient monuments are distributed from the Solway Firth area north to the southern Hebrides, in the counties of Argyll and Dumfries and Galloway. A few Clyde Cairns have been recorded in North Uist in the Outer Hebrides.

Clyde cairns found in Scotland are identified by an open courtyard area surrounded with large stone slabs and attached to one or more roofed burial chamber areas. The burial chamber was often placed at one end of a rectangular or trapezoidal cairn, and was usually divided into separate burial compartments. Previous excavations suggest that these chambers were entered by removing the stone roof slabs. In some areas, Clyde cairns have one or more lateral chambers. The majority of these monuments were sited to have views over hills or mountains and over water. Many are situated alongside lochs. These monuments were often built in multiple phases. Only a few of the Clyde cairns have been fully excavated. Burnt human bone has been found in many Clyde burial chambers. Bowl pottery remnants have also been found. The tombs saw re-use of their burial chambers in the Early Bronze Age.

<text>The Battle of Calabria (9 July 1940) known to the Italian Navy as the Battle of Punta Stilo, was a naval battle during the Battle of the Mediterranean in the Second World War. Ships of the were opposed by vessels of the Mediterranean Fleet. The battle took place to the east of Punta Stilo, Calabria.

The battle was one of the few in the Mediterranean campaign involving large numbers of ships on both sides. The battle was indecisive and the ships returned to base; it was the first battleship engagement between the and the Mediterranean Fleet.

==Background==
When Italy entered the Second World War, its forces in Libya were ill-equipped for offensive operations, and the Italian fleet was forced to start large supply convoys in order to bring them up to fighting condition.

On 6 July a convoy of four merchant ships left Naples on their way to Benghazi, while attempting to fool the Allies into thinking they were making for Tripoli. That evening two torpedo boats from Catania and another freighter met them off Messina and the next day their escort force joined the convoy from Taranto after being informed that the Allies had recently left port in Alexandria. The transports carried 2,190 troops, 72 Fiat M11/39 tanks, 232 other vehicles, of supplies and of fuel. The convoy&#x27;s escort, commanded by Admiral Inigo Campioni, consisted of three groups. The first, comprising four destroyers and six torpedo boats, sailed directly protecting the cargo ships. A second group sailed to the east consisting of six heavy cruisers and another four destroyers. Finally, the main battle group consisted of two battleships ( and ), eight light cruisers and another 16 destroyers. A substantial number of the Italian destroyers didn&#x27;t take part in the battle due to mechanical problems and the need to refuel.

The British were involved in a similar convoy action. The fleet sailed from Alexandria bound towards Malta where the destroyers would deliver supplies and a limited number of specialist reinforcements. Two convoys were arranged to take off fleet stores and civilians from Malta to Alexandria. Two groups of merchantmen sailed, a fast convoy at and slow one at . Protecting them were three groups of ships: Force A, with five cruisers and a destroyer; Force B, with the battleship and five destroyers, and Force C, the main battle group, with the battleships and , the aircraft carrier and eleven destroyers. One of them, , had to return to Alexandria with a burst steam pipe on the early hours of 8 July. All were under the direction of Admiral Andrew Cunningham.

At 14:40 on 8 July two Italian Cant Z.506 seaplanes from Tobruk spotted the British fleet and shadowed it for nearly four hours. Campioni ordered his fleet to defend the convoy by turning eastward and preparing for action. Comando Supremo (Italian Supreme Command) was reluctant to risk its warships in a night action and they ordered the fleet to avoid contact. During the initial positioning the Italians suffered technical problems on three destroyers and two light cruisers, so these ships, with several additional destroyers, were detached to refuel in Sicily. To make up for the detachments another destroyer group was summoned from Taranto. At this point, the Italian fleet had 16 destroyers.

From 10:00 to 18.40, 72 land-based bombers of the Italian (Royal Air Force) from the mainland attacked the British force. Unlike the dive-bombers favoured by the Germans, Italian bombers operated in formations at high altitudes during the early stages of the war, about . Scores of bombs were dropped by the Italians and achieved a hit on in two attacks. The captain, six officers and eleven ratings were killed, three officers and six ratings were wounded. The forward fire control and the steering equipment was destroyed, and for the rest of the battle, she would be commanded from the emergency station.

At 15:10 on 8 July, Cunningham&#x27;s fleet steamed toward Taranto, to cut the Italians&#x27; return route. At dusk, Cunningham changed course from 310° to 260° and slowed the fleet speed. During the first hours of 9 July, they took a 305° course, to avoid the Italian air reconnaissance while keeping their fleet between the Italian squadron and the Gulf of Taranto. By 12:30, the Italian Supreme Command was unaware of the situation of the British fleet. Campioni told his fleet to scramble by 14:00 about south east of Cape Spartivento in search of the British. Campioni eventually received reports of the British position at 13:30, and six Ro.43 floatplanes launched shortly after by the Italian cruisers spotted the British warships 30 miles closer than supposed. By late evening of 8 July, the Italian convoy had arrived in Benghazi unscathed.

==Battle==

===Cruiser engagement===

At noon on 9 July the two fleets were apart. Vice Admiral Cunningham could not close the distance to engage with the further back formation of &quot;Malaya&quot; and the significantly slower &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; ( vs ) and took &quot;Warspite&quot; in on its own. Meanwhile, at 13:15, &quot;Eagle&quot; launched several unsuccessful sorties by Fairey Swordfish against the Italian heavy cruisers, which they mistook for battleships. At 13:10, the Italian Supreme Command had instructed Campioni to engage one of the two enemy forces facing him, but in fact they had planned to keep the action close to Italy and were deliberately moving north in order to draw the Allies closer to their airbases. By 14:00, however, Cunningham&#x27;s plans to cut off the Italian fleet from Taranto had succeeded.

The Allied cruiser group was spread out in front of &quot;Warspite&quot; and at 15:15 they caught sight of the Italian main battle force and the two groups opened fire at . Italian rangefinding was better than the Allied, and within three minutes they had found the distance even though they were firing at extreme range. Although the Allies&#x27; rangefinding was not as good and they had trouble with their rounds falling short, the Allied gunlaying was better and they were able to place their rounds in much tighter groups. Generally the gunnery of the two forces was fairly well matched. After only a few minutes the range was down to and the Allied guns became useful. However, by 15:22, the Italian fire came dangerously close to the Allied cruisers and Vice Admiral John Tovey decided to disengage. At this point splinters from a shell fired by the cruiser hit , damaging her catapult and the reconnaissance aircraft beyond repair. The cruisers continued to open the range and by 15:30 fire ceased.

===Battleship engagement===
One group of Italian light cruisers, mistaken for the heavy cruisers of the , was on the Allied side of the battle line and was soon within range of the charging &quot;Warspite&quot;. Once again the Allied rounds fell short, and neither of her targets, and , received any damage in the initial salvos. However, by this time &quot;Warspite&quot; was also out of position, and she circled in place in order to allow &quot;Malaya&quot; to catch up. Meanwhile, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was still well to the rear.

The Italian commander decided to take on &quot;Warspite&quot;, and started moving his two battleships into position. At 15:52 &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; opened fire at a range of . &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; held her fire, as Italian doctrine was for battleships to fight one-on-one. It had been discovered during the Battle of Jutland that more than one ship firing at a single target made it very difficult for the rangefinding parties to tell which rounds were fired by their ship. &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; had been assigned to &quot;Malaya&quot; and &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, which did not enter the engagement.

&quot;Warspite&quot;, not aware of the Italian firing patterns, split her guns between the two ships. During the exchange one of &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;″s rounds fell long and caused splinter damage to &quot;Warspite&quot;″s escorting destroyers and , which had formed up on the far side of the action. At 15:54 &quot;Malaya&quot; started firing, well out of range, hoping to cause some confusion on the Italian ships. Meanwhile, the Italian heavy cruisers came into action and started firing on &quot;Warspite&quot; at 15:55 but had to break off as the Allied cruisers returned.

At 15:59 two shells from &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; fell very close to &quot;Warspite&quot;. Almost immediately after, one of &quot;Warspite&quot;″s rounds hit the rear deck of &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, exploding in the funnel, and setting off the stored ammunition for one of her anti-aircraft guns. Two seamen were killed and several wounded. The fumes from the burning ammunition were sucked down into the engine room, which had to evacuate and shut down half of the boilers. &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;″s speed quickly fell off to 18 knots and &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; took over. &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; and &quot;Warspite&quot; were well over apart at the time of the hit, which was one of the longest-range naval artillery hits in history.

It would appear that &quot;Warspite&quot; was in an excellent position to deal some serious blows to the slowing &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, but she once again executed another tight turn to allow &quot;Malaya&quot; to catch up. With her guns suddenly silenced during the turn, rangefinders on &quot;Malaya&quot; discovered what the Italians had been intending to avoid, that her rounds were falling short of &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; and they had been watching &quot;Warspite&quot;″s rounds, not their own.

At 16:01 the Italian destroyers generated smoke and the battleships got under cover. There is some debate about this point today, the Allied position being that the battleships were leaving battle, the Italian that they were attempting to make a torpedo attack with their destroyers from within the smoke.

===Final actions===
At 15:58 re-opened fire on her counterpart in the Allied line, , and soon two groups of Italian cruisers (, and , closely followed by and ) entered combat range with the main Allied cruiser battle group. Firing continued as both groups attempted to form up and at 16:07 &quot;Bolzano&quot; was hit three times by 6-inch shells from HMS &quot;Neptune&quot;, temporarily locking her rudder and causing two fatalities in the torpedo room. A near miss on the destroyer caused minor damage.

Meanwhile, mechanics on &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; were able to repair two of the four damaged boilers, allowing the battleship to reach . Admiral Campioni, considering the possibility of his remaining battleship, &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot;, having to face three enemy battleships and an aircraft carrier, decided to withdraw the battleships towards Messina. &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; was out of action for 30 days.

Over the next hour both fleets attempted to make long-range torpedo runs with their destroyer groups, without success. At 16:40, the Italian air force made an attack with 126 aircraft, reporting damage on &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Warspite&quot; and &quot;Malaya&quot;; because of some misunderstanding, 50 of the Italian aircraft also attacked the Italian ships, without damage. The battle ended at 16:50 with both sides withdrawing.

One final victim was the destroyer , sent to Augusta in Sicily, which was hit by a torpedo launched from a Swordfish at 09:40 the next day and sank in shallow water. She was refloated and returned to service in December 1941.)

==Aftermath==
After the battle both fleets turned for home. This allowed the Italians to claim a victory of sorts, as their cargo ships were already past the action by this time and sailed safely for Libya. Meanwhile, the Allied ships also reached Alexandria along with their escort. Although the battle was indecisive, Allied sources claimed that the Royal Navy asserted an important &quot;moral ascendancy&quot; over their Italian counterpart.

Other sources instead dispute those claims, pointing out that, in the immediate aftermath of the battle, the moods of the two commanders were quite different. Campioni wrote that, even having been able to employ only two old refurbished battleships, the battle gave to every man in the fleet, from the senior officers to the seamen, the impression of being able to cope with the British Fleet on equal terms. Cunningham, conversely, was dismayed by the performance of his two older units, whose lack of speed permitted the Italians to dictate the course of the action, and whose guns were out-ranged not only by those of the two Italian battleships, but by those of the heavy cruisers as well. Cunningham dismissed the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; as a &quot;constant source of anxiety&quot;, and asked the Admiralty for two or three more s, possibly equipped with radar, a new carrier with an armoured deck, the heavy cruisers and , and enough smaller ships to cover the major units.

One question is why the Italians did not send their two operational battleships of at Taranto, both almost ready for action and only a few hours from the scene. Both capital ships were still undergoing trials, and had suffered an electrical mishap on one of her main turrets. &quot;Littorio&quot; and would have tipped the balance of fire well onto the Italian side.

Even without these ships the fleets were fairly even. Despite Italian superiority in aircraft, due to the nearby land-based aircraft of the , the attacks proved ineffective, achieving little apart from the damage to &quot;Gloucester.&quot; Despite this, the air arm&#x27;s battle reports were inflated to the point of claiming damage to half of the Allied fleet.

Overall, Allied gunnery proved superior, while the Italian salvos were too widely dispersed due to technical reasons that were not to be overcome until the end of the conflict.

<text>Phul Mata is a Hindu goddess of disease, one of a group of seven sister goddesses with similar associations. Her sisters were Sitala Mata, Chamariya mata, Durga Kali, Maha Kali, Bhadra kali and Kalika Bhavani. As a group, they were well known in northern India, and were often represented by balls of clay. Phul Mata was specifically associated with typhoid fever.

Phul Mata is mentioned in epic and Puranic Hindu literature. She may have originally been perceived as a shakti, a personification of divine power, but in Hinduism gradually became associated with evil intent and illness. She was said to inflict sickness on children under seven years of age.

<text>A gallery grave is a form of megalithic tomb built primarily during the Neolithic Age in Europe in which the main gallery of the tomb is entered without first passing through an antechamber or hallway. There are at least four major types of gallery grave (complex, transepted, segmented, and wedge-shaped), and they may be covered with an earthen mound (or &quot;tumulus&quot;) or rock mound (or &quot;cairn&quot;).

==Background==
Archeologist T. Douglas Price argues that the gallery grave was a form of community burial site. Those placed in a gallery grave were most likely members of the same family or hamlet, and probably were intended to reinforce the sense of community.

Gallery graves may be straight, or they may form an ell. In some cases, a burial chamber exists at the end of the gallery. The walls of gallery graves were built of orthostats, slab-like stones set upright in the earth. They were roofed with multiple flat stones, although the burial chamber (if one existed) was usually roofed with a single large stone. Multiple burials could occur all at one time, the grave could be reopened several times to accept new burials, or the grave could remain open over an extended period of time to accept multiple burials.
Burials in gallery graves were made in the gallery itself, or in small burial chambers opening off the gallery. This is known as a &quot;complex gallery grave&quot;. When the adjacent burial chambers are paired, the structure is known as a &quot;transepted gallery grave&quot;. Gallery graves may also have their galleries subdivided by interior stone slabs. These are known as &quot;segmented gallery graves&quot;. When two parallel galleries lead to a single terminal burial chamber, this is known as a &quot;parallel gallery grave&quot;.

Some gallery graves were not rectangular in shape, but rather narrowed toward the rear. These are known as wedge-shaped gallery graves. The ceilings of wedge-shaped gallery graves often sloped toward the rear, and a sill of stone set some distance inside the away from the entrance or one or two slabs set upright in the earth defined a sort of antechamber. The wedge-shaped gallery grave was usually topped by a cairn (covering of stones) rather than an earthen mound (or &quot;tumulus&quot;), although an earthen mound was sometimes used. The cross-sectional shape of the cairn could be round, oval, or D-shaped, and often a kerb (ring of stone) was used to help revet the cairn and keep it in place. Some wedge-shaped gallery graves had curved rear walls, while others were linear. A few had the terminal burial chamber at the rear of the gallery, although this was usually blocked off. Wedge-shaped gallery graves sometimes had a set of outer walls. These could be parallel to the inner walls, or they could be set at an even stronger angle (emphasizing the wedge-like nature of the tomb). Wedge-shaped gallery graves usually faced west, and often had a pair of upright stone slabs linking the inner and outer walls at the entrance.

The tumulus (or &quot;barrow&quot;) covering a gallery grave may be ovate or long. The sides of the tumulus may be parallel or not. The tumulus was designed so that the end of the gallery (or the terminal burial chamber, if one existed) was at the center of the tumulus. A tumulus may contain several gallery graves radiating outward from the center. Since the earth atop the gallery grave was only loosely piled up, it often washed away due to erosion. Many gallery graves today lie exposed to the air, when originally they would have lain deep within a tumulus.

===Gallery vs. passage grave===
The difference between a complex gallery grave and a passage grave (which also has smaller burial chambers opening off the main passage) is two-fold. First, the gallery grave gallery will be as high and wide as the side burial chambers, while in a passage grave the passage is not as high or wide as the burial chambers. Second, gallery graves are usually topped by a V-shaped tumulus, while passage graves are almost always covered by a round tumulus.

==Types==
===Transepted===
Transepted gallery graves have burial monuments with side rooms extending laterally from a central chamber. They are found at sites in the Loire valley of France, south west Great Britain and in Ireland and it is thought the builders had cultural links with one another.

===Wedge-shaped===
A wedge-shaped gallery grave or wedge tomb is a type of Irish chamber tomb. They are so named because the burial chamber narrows at one end (usually decreasing both in height and width from west to east), producing a wedge shape in elevation. An antechamber is separated from the burial area by a simple jamb or sill, and the doorway generally faces west.

A distinguishing characteristic of wedge tombs is the double-walling of the gallery. They were often covered by cairns, which could be round, oval or D-shaped, often with a kerb to revet it. More are low sized, usually about 1.5 metres high, and are generally found on mountainsides, about three-quarters the way up.

Wedge tombs were built between the Irish late Neolithic and middle Bronze Ages (about 2500 to 2000BC). Today, between 500 and 550 known wedge tombs survive in Ireland, and are found predominantly in the west and north west of the island.

==Dating==
Along with the dolmen and passage grave, the gallery grave is the most common megalithic tomb in western Europe.

Gallery graves were usually constructed during the Neolithic Age, which began about 10,200 BC and ended in Europe about 3,200 BC. Some, however, were constructed in the Middle and Late Bronze Age, about 2,300 BC to 600 BC. Dating of some gallery graves is difficult, as the tombs may have been constructed in the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, but reopened and used for burials until the Late Bronze Age.

==Examples==

Archeologists Ian Shaw and Robert Jameson argued in 1999 that the best-researched gallery graves are the Severn-Cotswold tombs in Wales and South West England in the United Kingdom. Other important gallery graves include:

* Court cairn, found in western and northern Ireland and southwest Scotland
* Giants&#x27; grave in Sardinia
* Glantane East wedge-shaped tomb in Ireland
* Naveta grave in Menorca
* Seine-Oise-Marne culture &quot;allées couverte&quot; in northern France and southern Belgium
* Severn-Cotswold tombs in Wales and South West England in the United Kingdom
* Wartberg culture stone cist group tombs in northern Hesse, southern Lower Saxony, and western Thuringia in Germany

<text>The Nordic Folkboat is a sailing boat that was designed by Scandinavian Sailing Federation as a racer-cruiser and first built in 1942. Tord Sundén was hired by the Scandivian Sailing Federation to finalize the plans based on four awarded entries in the design competition. The awarded designs were done by Knud Olsen, Jac M. Iversen, Alfons Kvarnström, and O.W. Dahlström. No winning design was declared. Tord Sundén was never credited as the actual designer of the boat.

The Nordic Folkboat was developed into the Sundén-designed International Folkboat in 1967. The International Folkboat was expressly designed for fibreglass construction. The International 25 and the Olsen 26 are also based upon this design.

The Junior Folkboat designed by actually dates from 1929. It was originally called the &quot;Juniors Bad&quot; (Junior boat), but was later renamed because of its strong resemblance to the later and larger Nordic Folkboat.

==Production==
The design has been built by a number of different builders since the first were built in 1942 using wooden clinker construction.

By the mid 1970s, timber costs and competition from modern fibreglass boats meant that the folkboat sales were dwindling. Fibreglass versions of the traditional timber folkboat were created by Erik Andreasen and Sven Svendsen. They were molded to the exact dimensions and contours of the traditional clinker hull as well as having the same weight and weight distribution. By 2001, more than 950 glass reinforced plastic (GRP) folkboats had been built.

In the mid-2000s it was being built by Folkebådcentralen A/S of Denmark, but that company seems to be no longer in business. Today the boat is built by Haubold Yachting in Germany.

==Design==

In 1941, while most of Europe was immersed in the Second World War, Sweden was neutral. The Royal Swedish Sailing Association decided to hold a competition to choose a design for a new keelboat, with the support of Swedish shipping magnate Sven Salén, who had won a sailing bronze medal in the Six Meter class at the 1936 Summer Olympics held on the Bay of Kiel. Salén promoted the competition and it attracted 58 designs. The judges could not decide on a winner, instead naming six boats as all having some good attributes. As a young naval architect, Sundén was tasked by Salén with taking the best features of each design and drawing plans for a new boat that incorporated them all in the new design. The plans were published without a designer credited. Construction of the first boat was commenced at Arendals yard in Gothenburg in October 1941 and was launched the next spring, on 23 April 1942. Sundén later claimed the design as his own, but the committee disagreed on that point. Until the time of his death at age 90 in 1999, Sundén was still trying to establish his claim to the credit and the royalties for the design and the matter has never been fully resolved.

The Nordic Folkboat is a recreational keelboat, that was initially built using wooden clinker construction. It was later produced in fibreglass, with wooden trim, with the fibreglass hull simulating the clinker board construction. It has a fractional sloop rig with wooden spars. The hull has a spooned, raked stem, a sharply angled transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed modified long keel, with a cut-away forefoot. Typical versions displace and carry of iron ballast.

The boat has a draft of with the standard keel and may be fitted with a small outboard motor for docking and manoeuvring.

Some boats have sleeping accommodations for cruising, while others have minimal interiors, optimized for lightness for racing. Cruising-equipped boats often have sleeping accommodation for four people, with two main cabin bunks and a forward &quot;V&quot;-berth.

The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick DP-N racing average handicap of 103.2 and is usually raced by two to four sailors.

==Variants==
Numerous variants of the basic design have been built. The hull shape was largely retained, with variants being built in fibreglass, with new cabin and deck layouts and sometimes a revised keel shape.
;International Folkboat
:The Swedish Yard of Marieholm Bruk commissioned the original designer Tord Sundén to redesign the boat for fibreglass construction. The International Folkboat appeared in 1969 and became known in Europe as the Marieholm IF Boat. Fibreglass construction was used to create a more graceful profile, more interior space and a larger sail area was added for better light air performance.
;Marieholm 26
:A modification of the IF boat, also designed Tord Sundén and built by Marieholm Boats between 1976 and 1987. A further modification was the Marieholm 261 which was produced by Marieholm from 1982 to 2002 and featured a slightly wider beam.
;Contessa 26
:A British folkboat variant, it was drawn in 1965 by Jeremy Rodgers, who had built Folkboats for a number of years, and David Sadler. They took the classic Folkboat, modified the keel, added more sail area forward for better racing performance, changed the layout and deck structure, and built it from fiberglass instead of wood.
;Stella
:Designed by the yacht designer CR (Kim) Holman in 1959, this boat was made to the requirements of a customer who had seen the Nordic Folkboat. He thought that the English east coast needed a similar vessel, but modified for the North Sea, as opposed to Baltic conditions and also a competitive handicap racer.

==Operational history==
The boat is supported by an active class club that organizes racing events, the &quot;Nordic Folkboat International Association&quot;. It has national branches in Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Australia. There are also fleets in Finland, Latvia, Estonia and the San Francisco Bay area of the United States. By 1994, 110 boats were reportedly being sailed in the US.

In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, &quot;the boat is noted for its seaworthy character. With an iron keel, it has raced in winds of 40 knots and often carries full sail in 20-25. Most boats have two bunks, and perhaps a vee-berth forward, with camping gear used for cooking. There are lockers. The interiors are apt to vary widely, with some minimized for racing, and others adapted for cruising.&quot;

A review in &quot;Classic Boat&quot; magazine by Steffan Meyric-Hughes wrote, &quot;it has been described as a nautical Volkswagen Beetle. It has been hailed as a rare example of a good thing designed by a committee. But it&#x27;s more: the Folkboat is the most popular, successful and influential sailing yacht of all time. It comes in various guises and has spawned several derivatives, but the Nordic Folkboat is the original.&quot;

A review by Theo Rye in &quot;Classic Boat&quot; said, &quot;she has seakindly manners that punch far above her modest weight, and her deep cockpit and nicely balanced feel on the helm all add up to a simple but satisfying boat to really sail.&quot;

&quot;Practical Sailor&quot; magazine described the boat in 2010, saying, &quot;the Nordic Folkboat, a clinker-built sloop with a reverse transom, a spoon bow, and a low cabin that gave it simple but pretty lines. Its long keel, slack bilges, barn-door rudder, and hefty ballast ratio (just over 50 percent) equipped it for North Sea adventures. The cockpit however—because it was not self-bailing—raised the risk quotient for any offshore ambitions. The 7/8-fractional rig gave it a conservative sail-area displacement ratio of 16.28. The length-to-beam ratio was just under 3.5. The four-foot draft appealed to the shoalwater challenged. Headroom was ideal for those wonderful creatures of Scandinavian folklore: elves.&quot;

Dieter Loibner described the boat in &quot;Soundings&quot; in 2017 as &quot;a descendant of the sturdy Viking ships, a wind&#x27;s bride that knows how to handle Erasmus’ moods&quot;.

Danish sailor, Paul Elvstrøm, said &quot;At first nobody seemed to like them. It took a while for people to figure out how seaworthy these boats actually are and how well they perform when it is rough.&quot;

<doc id="656066" wikidata="Q608107" url="?curid=656066" title="Fake (Swedish band)">
<text>Fake was a Swedish synthpop band during the 1980s.

==History==
Fake was formed when two Swedish musicians, Erik Strömblad and Stefan Bogstedt, founded their own band, then called Size 46, in 1977. The band grew over the next few years, with metal drummer Stefan Sverin and singers Tony Wilhelmsson and Ulrika Örn being added to the lineup, and with more synthesizers added to their rock music sound. Stefan Sverin moved on as a session drummer for various acts such as American actor Cliff Taylor and Claes Muncktell from Dave and the Mistakes. He has since gave up drumming and is now working as an Art Director in Stockholm.

The group&#x27;s second single, &quot;Donna Rouge&quot;, was a major hit in Italy and the remix became a disco classic. The band performed on the &quot;Discoring&quot; television show in 1985 and Festivalbar in 1985. An album, &quot;New Art&quot;, was released in 1984. Another single, &quot;Brick&quot;, was released a year later and was also a big success internationally, reaching #1 in Italy and #6 in France. For the official music video for &quot;Brick&quot;, neither Tony Wilhelmsson nor Ulrika Örn were available to sing, so the video was filmed with guitarist Erik Strömblad and friend Lenita Rydberg miming to the words.

After the recording of &quot;Brick&quot;, the band split up, but in 2001, plans were made for a reformation.

<doc id="656087" wikidata="Q203824" url="?curid=656087" title="Italo-Turkish War">
<text>The Italo-Turkish or Turco-Italian War (, &quot;Tripolitanian War&quot;, , &quot;War of Libya&quot;) was fought between the Kingdom of Italy and the Ottoman Empire from 29 September 1911 to 18 October 1912. As a result of this conflict, Italy captured the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet, of which the main sub-provinces were Fezzan, Cyrenaica, and Tripoli itself. These territories became the colonies of Italian Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, which would later merge into Italian Libya.

During the conflict, Italian forces also occupied the Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea. Italy agreed to return the Dodecanese to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Ouchy in 1912. However, the vagueness of the text, combined with subsequent adverse events unfavourable to the Ottoman Empire (the outbreak of the Balkan Wars and World War I), allowed a provisional Italian administration of the islands, and Turkey eventually renounced all claims on these islands in Article 15 of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.

The war is considered a precursor of the First World War. Members of the Balkan League, seeing how easily Italy defeated the Ottomans and motivated by incipient Balkan nationalism, attacked the Ottoman Empire in October 1912, starting the First Balkan War a few days before the end of the Italo-Turkish War.

The Italo-Turkish War saw some technological changes, most notably the use of airplanes in combat. On 23 October 1911, an Italian pilot, &quot;Capitano&quot; Carlo Piazza, flew over Turkish lines on the world&#x27;s first aerial reconnaissance mission, and on 1 November, the first aerial bomb was dropped by &quot;Sottotenente&quot; Giulio Gavotti, on Turkish troops in Libya, from an early model of Etrich Taube aircraft. The Turks, using rifles, were the first to shoot down an airplane. Another use of new technology was a network of wireless telegraphy stations established soon after the initial landings. Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy, came to Libya to conduct experiments with the Italian Corps of Engineers.

Italian claims to Libya date back to the Ottoman defeat by the Russian Empire during the War of 1877–1878 and subsequent disputes thereafter. At the Congress of Berlin in 1878, France and the United Kingdom had agreed to the French occupation of Tunisia and British control over Cyprus respectively, which were both parts of the declining Ottoman state.

When Italian diplomats hinted about possible opposition to the Anglo-French maneuvers by their government, the French replied that Tripoli would have been a counterpart for Italy, which made a secret agreement with the British government in February 1887 via a diplomatic exchange of notes. The agreement stipulated that Italy would support British control in Egypt, and that Britain would likewise support Italian influence in Libya. In 1902, Italy and France had signed a secret treaty which accorded freedom of intervention in Tripolitania and Morocco. The agreement, negotiated by Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Prinetti and French Ambassador Camille Barrère, ended the historic rivalry between both nations for control of North Africa. The same year, the British government promised Italy that &quot;any alteration in the status of Libya would be in conformity with Italian interests&quot;. Those measures were intended to loosen Italian commitment to the Triple Alliance and thereby weaken Germany, which France and Britain viewed as their main rival in Europe. 

Following the Anglo-Russian Convention and the establishment of the Triple Entente, Tsar Nicholas II and King Victor Emmanuel III made the 1909 Racconigi Bargain in which Russia acknowledged Italy&#x27;s interest in Tripoli and Cyrenaica in return for Italian support for Russian control of the Bosphorus. However, the Italian government did little to realise that opportunity and so knowledge of the Libyan territory and resources remained scarce in the following years. 

The removal of diplomatic obstacles coincided with increasing colonial fervor. In 1908, the Italian Colonial Office was upgraded to a Central Directorate of Colonial Affairs. The nationalist Enrico Corradini led the public call for action in Libya and, joined by the nationalist newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Idea Nazionale&quot; in 1911, demanded an invasion. The Italian press began a large-scale lobbying campaign for an invasion of Libya in late March 1911. It was fancifully depicted as rich in minerals and well-watered, defended by only 4,000 Ottoman troops. Also, its population was described as hostile to the Ottomans and friendly to the Italians, and they predicted that the future invasion would be little more than a &quot;military walk&quot;.

The Italian government remained committed into 1911 to the maintenance of the Ottoman Empire, which was a close friend of its German ally. Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti rejected nationalist calls for conflict over Ottoman Albania, which was seen as a possible colonial project, as late as the summer of 1911.

However, the Agadir Crisis in which French military action in Morocco in July 1911 would lead to the establishment of a French protectorate, changed the political calculations. The Italian leadership then decided that it could safely accede to public demands for a colonial project. The Triple Entente powers were highly supportive. British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey stated to the Italian ambassador on 28 July that he would support Italy, not the Ottomans. On 19 September, Grey instructed Permanent Under-Secretary of State Sir Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock that Britain and France should not interfere with Italy&#x27;s designs on Libya. Meanwhile, the Russian government urged Italy to act in a &quot;prompt and resolute manner&quot;.

In contrast to its engagement with the Entente powers, Italy largely ignored its military allies in the Triple Alliance. Giolitti and Foreign Minister Antonino Paternò Castello agreed on 14 September to launch a military campaign &quot;before the Austrian and German governments [were aware] of it&quot;. Germany was then actively attempting to mediate between Rome and Constantinople, and Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal repeatedly warned Italy that military action in Libya would threaten the integrity of the Ottoman Empire and create a crisis in the Eastern Question, which would destabilise the Balkan Peninsula and the European balance of power. Italy also foresaw that result since Paternò Castello, in a July report to the king and Giolitti, laid out the reasons for and against military action in Libya, and he raised the concern that the Balkan revolt, which would likely follow an Italian attack on Libya, might force Austria-Hungary to take military action in Balkan areas claimed by Italy.

The Italian Socialist Party had a strong influence over public opinion, but it was in opposition and also divided on the issue. It acted ineffectively against military intervention. The future Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, who was then still a left-wing Socialist, took a prominent antiwar position. A similar opposition was expressed in Parliament by Gaetano Salvemini and Leone Caetani.

An ultimatum was presented to the Ottoman government, led by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), on the night of 26–27 September 1911. Through Austro-Hungarian intermediation, the Ottomans replied with the proposal of transferring control of Libya without war and maintaining a formal Ottoman suzerainty. That suggestion was comparable to the situation in Egypt, which was under formal Ottoman suzerainty but was under &quot;de facto&quot; control by the British. Giolitti refused.

Italy declared war on 29 September 1911.

==Military campaign==
===Opening maneuver===


The Italian army was ill-prepared for the war and was not informed of the government&#x27;s plans for Libya until late September. The army had a shortage of soldiers as the class of 1889 was demobilized before the war started. Military operations started with the bombardment of Tripoli on 3 October. The city was conquered by 1,500 sailors, much to the enthusiasm of the interventionist minority in Italy. Another proposal for a diplomatic settlement was rejected by the Italians, and so the Ottomans decided to defend the province.

On 29 September 1911, Italy published the declaration of their direct interest towards Libya. Without a proper response, the Italian forces landed on the shores of Libya on 4 October 1911. A considerable number of Italians were living within the Ottoman Empire, mostly inhabiting Istanbul, Izmir, and Thessaloniki, dealing with trade and industry. The sudden declaration of war shocked both the Italian community living in the Empire as well as the Ottoman government. Depending on the mutual friendly relations, the Ottoman Government had sent their Libyan battalions to Yemen in order to suppress local rebellions, leaving only the military police in Libya.

Therefore, the Ottomans did not have a full army in Tripolitania. Many of the Ottoman officers had to travel there by their own means, often secretly, through Egypt since the British government would not allow Ottoman troops to be transported en masse through Egypt. The Ottoman Navy was too weak to transport troops by sea. The Ottomans organised local Libyans for the defence against the Italian invasion.

Between 1911 and 1912, over 1,000 Somalis from Mogadishu, the capital of Italian Somaliland, served as combat units along with Eritrean and Italian soldiers in the Italo-Turkish War. Most of the Somalian troops stationed would return home only in 1935, when they were transferred back to Italian Somaliland in preparation for the invasion of Ethiopia.

===Italian troops landing in Libya===
The first disembarkation of Italian troops occurred on 10 October. Having no prior military experiences and lacking adequate planning for amphibious invasions, the Italian armies poured onto the coasts of Libya, facing numerous problems during their landings and deployments. One of these problems was that the Ottoman vice admiral in 1911, Bucknam Pasha, was at first successfully blockading the Italians from landing on the Tripolitanian coast.

The Italians believed that a force of 20,000 would be able to take over Libya. The force was able to capture Tripoli, Tobruk, Derna, Bengasi, and Homs between 3 and 21 October. However, the Italians suffered a defeat at Shar al-Shatt, with at least 21 officers and 482 soldiers dead. The Italians executed 400 women and 4,000 men through firing squads and hanging in retaliation.

The corps was consequently enlarged to 100,000 men who had to face 20,000 Libyans and 8,000 Ottomans. The war turned into one of position. Even the Italian utilisation of armoured cars and air power, both among the earliest in modern warfare, had little effect on the initial outcome. In the first military use of heavier-than-air craft, &quot;Capitano&quot; Carlo Piazza flew the first reconnaissance flight on 23 October 1911. A week later, &quot;Sottotenente&quot; Giulio Gavotti dropped four grenades on Tajura (Arabic: تاجوراء Tājūrā’, or Tajoura) and Ain Zara in the first aerial bombing in history.

===Trench phase===
Technologically and numerically superior Italian forces easily managed to take the shores. However, the Italians still could not penetrate deep inland. The Libyans and Turks, estimated at 15,000, made frequent attacks day and night on the strongly-entrenched Italian garrison in the southern suburbs of Benghazi. The four Italian infantry regiments on the defensive were supported by the cruisers and . The Italians rarely attempted a sortie.

An attack of 20,000 Ottoman and local troops was repulsed on 30 November with considerable losses. Shortly afterward, the garrison was reinforced by the 57th infantry regiment from Italy. The battleship also arrived from Tobruk. During the night of 14 and 15 December, the Ottomans attacked in great force but were repulsed with aid of the fire from the ships. The Italians lost several field guns.

At Derna, the Ottomans and the Libyans were estimated at 3,500, but they were being constantly reinforced, and a general assault on the Italian position was expected. The Italian and Turkish forces in Tripoli and Cyrenaica were constantly reinforced since the Ottoman withdrawal to the interior enabled them to reinforce their troops considerably.

Lacking a considerable navy, the Ottomans were not able to send regular forces to Libya and so the Ottoman government supported a great number of young officers to travel to the area in order to rally the locals and coordinate the resistance. Enver Bey, Mustafa Kemal Bey, Ali Fethi Bey, Cami Bey, Nuri Bey and many other Turkish officers managed to reach Libya, traveling under secret identities such as covering as a medical doctor, journalist among others. The Ottoman Şehzade Osman Fuad had also joined these officers, granting royal support to the resistance. During the war, Mustafa Kemal Bey, the future founder of the Republic of Turkey, was wounded by shrapnel to his eye. The cost of the war was defrayed chiefly by voluntary offerings from Muslims; men, weapons, ammunition and all kinds of other supplies were constantly sent across to the Egyptian and Tunisian frontiers, not withstanding their neutrality. The Italians occupied Sidi Barrani on the coast between Tobruk and Solum to prevent contraband and troops from entering across the Egyptian frontier, and the naval blockaders guarded the coast as well as capturing several sailing ships laden with contraband.
Italian troops landed at Tobruk after a brief bombardment on 4 December 1911, occupied the seashore, and marched towards the hinterlands facing weak resistance. Small numbers of Ottoman soldiers and Libyan volunteers were later organized by Captain Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The small 22 December Battle of Tobruk resulted in Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s victory. With that achievement, he was assigned to Derna War quarters to coordinate the field on 6 March 1912. The Libyan campaign ground to a stalemate by December 1911.

On 3 March 1912, 1,500 Libyan volunteers attacked Italian troops who were building trenches near Derna. The Italians, who were outnumbered but had superior weaponry, held the line. A lack of coordination between the Italian units sent from Derna as reinforcements and the intervention of Ottoman artillery threatened the Italian line, and the Libyans attempted to surround the Italian troops. Further Italian reinforcements, however, stabilised the situation, and the battle ended in the afternoon with an Italian victory.

On 14 September, the Italian command sent three columns of infantry to disband the Arab camp near Derna. The Italian troops occupied a plateau and interrupted Ottoman supply lines. Three days later, the Ottoman commander, Enver Bey, attacked the Italian positions on the plateau. The larger Italian fire drove back the Ottoman soldiers, who were surrounded by a battalion of Alpini and suffered heavy losses. A later Ottoman attack had the same outcome. Then, operations in Cyrenaica ceased until the end of the war.

Although some elements of the local population collaborated with the Italians, counterattacks by Ottoman soldiers with the help of local troops confined the Italian army to the coastal region. In fact, by the end of 1912 the Italians had made little progress in conquering Libya. The Italian soldiers were in effect besieged in seven enclaves on the coasts of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. The largest was at Tripoli and extended barely 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from the town.

===Naval warfare===
At sea, the Italians enjoyed a clear advantage. The Italian Navy had seven times the tonnage of the Ottoman Navy and was better trained.

In January 1912, the Italian cruiser &quot;Piemonte&quot;, with the Soldato class destroyers &quot;Artigliere&quot; and &quot;Garibaldino&quot;, sank seven Ottoman gunboats (&quot;Ayintab&quot;, &quot;Bafra&quot;, &quot;Gökcedag&quot;, &quot;Kastamonu&quot;, &quot;Muha&quot;, &quot;Ordu&quot; and &quot;Refahiye&quot;) and a yacht (&quot;Sipka&quot;) in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay. The Italians blockaded the Red Sea ports of the Ottomans and actively supplied and supported the Emirate of Asir, which was also then at war with the Ottoman Empire.

Then, on 24 February, in the Battle of Beirut, two Italian armoured cruisers attacked and sank an Ottoman casemate corvette and six lighters, retreated and returned and then sank an Ottoman torpedo boat. alone suffered 58 killed and 108 wounded. By contrast, the Italian ships took no casualties and also no direct hits from any of the Ottoman warships. Italy had feared that the Ottoman naval forces at Beirut could be used to threaten the approach to the Suez Canal. The Ottoman naval presence at Beirut was completely annihilated and casualties on the Ottoman side were heavy. The Italian Navy gained complete naval dominance of the southern Mediterranean for the rest of the war.
Although Italy could extend its control to almost all of the 2,000 km of the Libyan coast between April and early August 1912, its ground forces could not venture beyond the protection of the navy&#x27;s guns and so were limited to a thin coastal strip. In the summer of 1912, Italy began operations against the Ottoman possessions in the Aegean Sea with the approval of the other powers, which were eager to end a war that was lasting much longer than expected. Italy occupied twelve islands in the sea, comprising the Ottoman province of Rhodes, which then became known as the Dodecanese, but that raised the discontent of Austria-Hungary, which feared that it could fuel the irredentism of nations such as Serbia and Greece and cause imbalance in the already-fragile situation in the Balkan area. The only other relevant military operation of the summer was an attack of five Italian torpedo boats in the Dardanelles on 18 July.

===Irregular war and atrocities===
With a decree of 5 November 1911, Italy declared its sovereignty over Libya. Although the Italians controlled the coast, many of their troops had been killed in battle and nearly 6,000 Ottoman soldiers remained to face an army of nearly 140,000 Italians. As a result, the Ottomans began using guerrilla tactics. Indeed, some &quot;Young Turk&quot; officers reached Libya and helped organize a guerrilla war with local mujahideen. Many local Libyans joined forces with the Ottomans because of their common faith against the &quot;Christian invaders&quot; and started bloody guerrilla warfare. Italian authorities adopted many repressive measures against the rebels, such as public hangings as retaliation for ambushes.
On 23 October 1911, over 500 Italian soldiers were slaughtered by Turkish troops at Sciara Sciatt, on the outskirts of Tripoli. This massacre occurred, at least in part, reportedly due to the rape and sexual assault of Libyan and Turkish women by the Italian troops. Nevertheless, as a consequence, on the next day the 1911 Tripoli massacre had Italian troops systematically murder thousands of civilians by moving through local homes and gardens one by one, including by setting fire to a mosque with 100 refugees inside. Although Italian authorities attempted to keep the news of the massacre from getting out, the incident soon became internationally known. The Italians started to show photographs of the massacred Italian soldiers at Sciara Sciat to justify their revenge.

== Treaty of Ouchy==
Italian diplomats decided to take advantage of the situation to obtain a favourable peace deal. On 18 October 1912, Italy and the Ottoman Empire signed a treaty in Ouchy in Lausanne called the First Treaty of Lausanne, which is often also called Treaty of Ouchy to distinguish it from the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, (the Second Treaty of Lausanne).

The main provisions of the treaty were as follows:
* The Ottomans would withdraw all military personnel from Trablus and Benghazi vilayets (Libya), but in return, Italy would return Rhodes and the other Aegean islands that it held to the Ottomans.
* Trablus and Benghazi vilayets would have a special status and a &quot;naib&quot; (regent), and a &quot;kadi&quot; (judge) would represent the Caliph.
* Before the appointment of the &quot;kadis&quot; and &quot;naibs&quot;, the Ottomans would consult the Italian government.
* The Ottoman government would be responsible for the expenses of these &quot;kadis&quot; and &quot;naibs&quot;.

Subsequent events prevented the return of the Dodecanese to Turkey, however. The First Balkan War broke out shortly before the treaty had been signed. Turkey was in no position to reoccupy the islands while its main armies were engaged in a bitter struggle to preserve its remaining territories in the Balkans. To avoid a Greek invasion of the islands, it was implicitly agreed on that the Dodecanese would remain under neutral Italian administration until the conclusion of hostilities between the Greeks and the Ottomans, after which the islands would revert to Ottoman rule.

Turkey&#x27;s continued involvement in the Balkan Wars, followed shortly by World War I (which found Turkey and Italy again on opposing sides), meant that the islands were never returned to the Ottoman Empire. Turkey gave up its claims on the islands in the Treaty of Lausanne, and the Dodecanese continued to be administered by Italy until 1947, when after the Italian defeat in World War II, the islands were ceded to Greece.

==Aftermath==

The invasion of Libya was a costly enterprise for Italy. Instead of the 30 million lire a month judged sufficient at its beginning, it reached a cost of 80 million a month for a much longer period than was originally estimated. The war cost Italy 1.3 billion lire, nearly a billion more than Giovanni Giolitti estimated before the war. This ruined ten years of fiscal prudence.

After the withdrawal of the Ottoman army the Italians could easily extend their occupation of the country, seizing East Tripolitania, Ghadames, the Djebel and Fezzan with Murzuk during 1913. The outbreak of the First World War with the necessity to bring back the troops to Italy, the proclamation of the Jihad by the Ottomans and the uprising of the Libyans in Tripolitania forced the Italians to abandon all occupied territory and to entrench themselves in Tripoli, Derna, and on the coast of Cyrenaica. The Italian control over much of the interior of Libya remained ineffective until the late 1920s when forces under the Generals Pietro Badoglio and Rodolfo Graziani waged bloody pacification campaigns. Resistance petered out only after the execution of the rebel leader Omar Mukhtar on 15 September 1931. The result of the Italian colonisation for the Libyan population was that by the mid-1930s it had been cut in half due to emigration, famine, and war casualties. The Libyan population in 1950 was at the same level as in 1911, approximately 1.5 million.

=== Europe, Balkans and First World War ===
In 1924, the Serbian diplomat Miroslav Spalajković could look back on the events that led to the First World War and its aftermath and state of the Italian attack, &quot;all subsequent events are nothing more than the evolution of that first aggression.&quot; Unlike the British-controlled Egypt, the Ottoman Tripolitania vilayet, which made up modern-day Libya, was core territory of the Empire, like that of the Balkans. The coalition that had defended the Ottomans during the Crimean War (1853–1856), minimised Ottoman territorial losses at the Congress of Berlin (1878) and supported the Ottomans during the Bulgarian Crisis (1885–88) had largely disappeared. The reaction in the Balkans to the Italian declaration of war was immediate. The first draft by Serbia of a military treaty with Bulgaria against Turkey was written by November 1911, with a defensive treaty signed in March 1912 and an offensive treaty signed in May 1912 focused on military action against Ottoman-ruled Southeastern Europe. The series of bilateral treaties between Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro that created the Balkan League was completed in 1912, with the First Balkan War (1912–1913) beginning by a Montenegrin attack on 8 October 1912, ten days before the Treaty of Ouchy. The swift and nearly-complete victory of the Balkan League astonished contemporary observers. However, none of the victors were happy with the division of captured territory, which resulted in the Second Balkan War (1913) in which Serbia, Greece, the Ottomans, and Romania took almost all of the territory that Bulgaria had captured in the first war. In the wake of the enormous change in the regional balance of power, Russia switched its primary allegiance in the region from Bulgaria to Serbia and guaranteed Serbian autonomy from any outside military intervention. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by a Serbian nationalist and the resulting Austro-Hungarian plan for military action against Serbia was a major precipitating event of the First World War (1914–1918).

The Italo-Turkish War illustrated to the French and British governments that Italy was more valuable to them inside the Triple Alliance than being formally allied with the Entente. In January 1912, the French diplomat Paul Cambon wrote to Raymond Poincaré that Italy was &quot;more burdensome than useful as an ally. Against Austria, she harbours a latent hostility that nothing can disarm&quot;. The tensions within the Triple Alliance would eventually lead Italy to sign the 1915 Treaty of London, which had it abandon the Triple Alliance and join the Entente.

In Italy itself, massive funerals for fallen heroes brought the Catholic Church closer to the government from which it had long been alienated. There emerged a cult of patriotic sacrifice in which the colonial war was celebrated in an aggressive and imperialistic way. The ideology of &quot;crusade&quot; and &quot;martyrdom&quot; characterised the funerals. The result was to consolidate Catholic war culture among devout Italians, which was soon expanded to include Italian involvement in the Great War (1915–1918). That aggressive spirit was revived by the Fascists in the 1920s to strengthen their popular support.

The resistance in Libya was an important experience for the young officers of the Ottoman Army, such as Mustafa Kemal Bey, Enver Bey, Ali Fethi Bey, Cami Bey, Nuri Bey and many others. These young officers were to perform important military duties and accomplishments in the First World War, led the Turkish independency war and found the Republic of Turkey.

=== Fate of the Dodecanese Islands ===

Because of the First World War, the Dodecanese remained under Italian military occupation. According to the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, which was never ratified, Italy was supposed to cede all of the islands except Rhodes to Greece in exchange for a vast Italian zone of influence in southwest Anatolia. However, the Greek defeat in the Greco–Turkish War and the foundation of modern Turkey created a new situation that made the enforcement of the terms of that treaty impossible. In Article 15 of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which superseded the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, Turkey formally recognised the Italian annexation of the Dodecanese. The population was largely Greek, and by treaty in 1947, the islands eventually became part of Greece. As the Dodecanese were part of Italy, the local population was not affected by the subsequent population exchange between Greece and Turkey, and a small community of Dodecanese Turks has remained to this day.

===Literature===
In his book &quot;Primo, the Turkish Child&quot;, the Turkish author Ömer Seyfettin tells the fictional story of a boy living in the Ottoman city of Selânik (Salonica, today Thessaloniki), who has to choose his national identity between his Turkish father and Italian mother after the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 and the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 (Ömer Seyfettin, Primo Türk Çocuğu).

<text>In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, De Casteljau&#x27;s algorithm is a recursive method to evaluate polynomials in Bernstein form or Bézier curves, named after its inventor Paul de Casteljau. De Casteljau&#x27;s algorithm can also be used to split a single Bézier curve into two Bézier curves at an arbitrary parameter value.

The algorithm is numerically stable when compared to direct evaluation of polynomials. The computational complexity of this algorithm is formula_1, where d is the number of dimensions, and n is the number of control points. There exist faster alternatives.

== Definition ==
A Bézier curve formula_2 (of degree formula_3, with control points formula_4) can be written in Bernstein form as follows
formula_5
where formula_6 is a Bernstein basis polynomial
formula_7
The curve at point formula_8 can be evaluated with the recurrence relation
formula_9

Then, the evaluation of formula_2 at point formula_8 can be evaluated in formula_12 operations. The result formula_13 is given by
formula_14

Moreover, the Bézier curve formula_2 can be split at point formula_8 into two curves with respective control points:
formula_17

=== Geometric interpretation ===
The geometric interpretation of De Casteljau&#x27;s algorithm is straightforward. 
*Consider a Bézier curve with control points formula_18. Connecting the consecutive points we create the control polygon of the curve.
*Subdivide now each line segment of this polygon with the ratio formula_19 and connect the points you get. This way you arrive at the new polygon having one fewer segment.
*Repeat the process until you arrive at the single point – this is the point of the curve corresponding to the parameter formula_20.
The following picture shows this process for a cubic Bézier curve:

Note that the intermediate points that were constructed are in fact the control points for two new Bézier curves, both exactly coincident with the old one. This algorithm not only evaluates the curve at formula_20, but splits the curve into two pieces at formula_20, and provides the equations of the two sub-curves in Bézier form.

The interpretation given above is valid for a nonrational Bézier curve. To evaluate a rational Bézier curve in formula_23, we may project the point into formula_24; for example, a curve in three dimensions may have its control points formula_25 and weights formula_26 projected to the weighted control points formula_27. The algorithm then proceeds as usual, interpolating in formula_28. The resulting four-dimensional points may be projected back into three-space with a perspective divide.

In general, operations on a rational curve (or surface) are equivalent to operations on a nonrational curve in a projective space. This representation as the &quot;weighted control points&quot; and weights is often convenient when evaluating rational curves.

=== Notation ===
When doing the calculation by hand it is useful to write down the coefficients in a triangle scheme as
formula_29
When choosing a point &quot;t&quot;0 to evaluate a Bernstein polynomial we can use the two diagonals of the triangle scheme to construct a division of the polynomial
formula_30
into
formula_31
and
formula_32

== Bézier curve ==


When evaluating a Bézier curve of degree &quot;n&quot; in 3-dimensional space with &quot;n&quot; + 1 control points P&quot;i&quot;
formula_33
with
formula_34
we split the Bézier curve into three separate equations
formula_35
which we evaluate individually using De Casteljau&#x27;s algorithm.

== Example ==
We want to evaluate the Bernstein polynomial of degree 2 with the Bernstein coefficients
formula_36
at the point &quot;t&quot;0.

We start the recursion with
formula_37
and with the second iteration the recursion stops with
formula_38
which is the expected Bernstein polynomial of degree &quot;2&quot;.

== Implementations ==
Here are example implementations of De Casteljau&#x27;s algorithm in various programming languages.

=== Haskell ===

deCasteljau :: Double -&gt; [(Double, Double)] -&gt; (Double, Double)
deCasteljau t [b] = b
deCasteljau t coefs = deCasteljau t reduced
 where
 reduced = zipWith (lerpP t) coefs (tail coefs)
 lerpP t (x0, y0) (x1, y1) = (lerp t x0 x1, lerp t y0 y1)
 lerp t a b = t * b + (1 - t) * a
=== Python ===

def de_casteljau(t: float, coefs: list[float]) -&gt; float:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;De Casteljau&#x27;s algorithm.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 beta = coefs.copy() # values in this list are overridden
 n = len(beta)
 for j in range(1, n):
 for k in range(n - j):
 beta[k] = beta[k] * (1 - t) + beta[k + 1] * t
 return beta[0]
=== Java ===

public double deCasteljau(double t, double[] coefficients) {
 double[] beta = coefficients;
 int n = beta.length;
 for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) {
 for (int j = 0; j &lt; (n - i); j++) {
 beta[j] = beta[j] * (1 - t) + beta[j + 1] * t;
 }
 return beta[0];


=== Code Example in JavaScript ===
The following JavaScript function applies De Casteljau&#x27;s algorithm to an array of control points or poles as originally named by De Casteljau to reduce them one by one until reaching a point in the curve for a given t between 0 for the first point of the curve and 1 for the last one
function crlPtReduceDeCasteljau(points, t) {
 let retArr = [ points.slice () ];
 while (points.length &gt; 1) {
 let midpoints = [];
 for (let i = 0; i+1 &lt; points.length; ++i) {
 let ax = points[i][0];
 let ay = points[i][1];
 let bx = points[i+1][0];
 let by = points[i+1][1];
 // a * (1-t) + b * t = a + (b - a) * t
 midpoints.push([
 ax + (bx - ax) * t,
 ay + (by - ay) * t,
 }
 retArr.push (midpoints)
 points = midpoints;
 return retArr;


For example,

 var poles = [ [0, 128], [128, 0], [256, 0], [384, 128] ] 
 crlPtReduceDeCasteljau (poles, .5)

returns the array

 [ [ [0, 128], [128, 0], [256, 0], [384, 128 ] ], 
 [ [64, 64], [192, 0], [320, 64] ], 
 [ [128, 32], [256, 32]], 
 [ [192, 32]], 

which yields the points and segments plotted below:

<text>Hummel (German: &quot;bumblebee&quot;) was a German self-propelled gun used by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during World War II. Based on the &quot;Geschützwagen&quot; III/IV chassis and armed with the 15 cm sFH 18/1 L/30 howitzer, it saw action from early 1943 until the end of the war. Its ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 165.

The full name was &quot;Panzerfeldhaubitze 18M auf Geschützwagen III/IV (Sf) Hummel, Sd.Kfz. 165&quot;. On February 27, 1944, Hitler ordered the name &quot;Hummel&quot; to be dropped as it was deemed inappropriate for a fighting vehicle.

==Development==
The &quot;Hummel&quot; was designed in 1942 after the invasion of the USSR had demonstrated the need for more capable self-propelled artillery support for Wehrmacht tank forces than those that were available at the time.

The first option considered was mounting a 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer on a Panzer III chassis, rejected in favour of the same gun on a Panzer IV chassis. One prototype was built.

This design was rejected in favour of mounting the more powerful 15 cm sFH 18 L/30 howitzer on the specially designed &quot;Geschützwagen&quot; III/IV, which combined the driving and steering system of the Panzer III with the chassis, suspension, and engine of the Panzer IV. The same platform was also used for the &quot;Nashorn&quot; tank destroyer.

The engine was moved to the centre of the vehicle to make room for an open-topped lightly armoured fighting compartment at the rear housing the gun breech and crew. Late models had a slightly redesigned driver compartment and front superstructure offering more room to the radio operator and driver. In all, some 700 &quot;Hummel&quot; were built.

==Variants==
*&quot;Munitionsträger Hummel&quot; (&quot;ammunition carrier &quot;Hummel&quot;&quot;) - Because the basic &quot;Hummel&quot; could carry only a limited amount of ammunition, the ammunition carrier based on the &quot;Hummel&quot; was developed. This was basically a standard production &quot;Hummel&quot; without the howitzer (a 10 mm armour plate covering the gun mount) and with racks fitted to hold the ammunition. When necessary, these could still be fitted with the 15 cm howitzer of the normal &quot;Hummel&quot;; this could even be done as a field conversion. By the end of the war 157 &quot;Munitionsträger Hummel&quot; were built.

==Combat history==
The &quot;Hummel&quot; first participated in large scale combat at the Battle of Kursk, when some 100 served in armored artillery battalions (&quot;Panzerartillerie Abteilungen&quot;) of the Panzer divisions. They were formed into separate heavy self-propelled artillery batteries, each with six Hummel and one ammunition carrier.

==Foreign use==
Foreign use of the Hummel was extremely limited. During WWII the Soviet Union deployed captured vehicles. Post-war only three nations are known to have acquired the gun, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Syria.

Romania received one unit from the Red Army after the war ended. This was assigned to the 2nd Armoured Regiment with its military registration number as U069009. It was officially known as the &quot;Hummel TAs self-propelled gun&quot; in the army&#x27;s inventory. The gun could not be used because it was missing the breech&#x27;s lock. It was showcased to the public in a military parade in Bucharest of 10 May 1946 with Romanian markings. All German armour in Romania was later phased out in 1950 and finally scrapped by 1954, the army deciding on the sole use of Soviet tanks and armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) instead.

Syria received five Hummel from France between the late 1940s and the early 1950s. Only a limited supply of main gun ammunition was provided (supplemented some time later by the Soviet Union, which had produced a sizeable quantity of compatible 150mm rounds domestically). These saw service against Israel up until the 1960s and all were most likely scrapped shortly afterwards.
==Operators==
* - 12 Hummel-Wespe
* - a single chassis with an inoperable weapon
* - five, captured guns received from France

==Surviving vehicles==
Six &quot;Hummel&quot; survive in museums, at the Munster &quot;Deutsches Panzermuseum&quot;, the Artillerie Schule in Idar Oberstein and the Sinsheim Auto &amp; Technik Museum in Germany, the &quot;Musée des Blindés&quot; in Saumur, France and the Fort Sill Field Artillery Museum in Fort Sill, Oklahoma and one has been reconstructed at the Australian Armour and Artillery Museum and is awaiting the Winterketten track.

<text>Sumo is the debut studio album by Australian alternative rock band the Superjesus, which was issued on 1 February 1998. It was produced and mixed by Matt Serletic for East West Records/Warner Music Australia and peaked at number 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The album was re-issued in October 1998 as &quot;Sumo II&quot;, with an additional disc of live performances. At the 1998 ARIA Music Awards &quot;Sumo&quot; won the inaugural Best Rock Album category. It was also nominated for Best Group, Breakthrough Artist – Album and Chris Tennent and William Tennent were nominated for Best Cover Art.

To celebrate 20 years since its release, &quot;Sumo&quot; was re-released in August 2018, with bonus tracks and on vinyl for the first time. The Superjesus toured the album during the second half of 2018.

==Background and recording==

&quot;Sumo&quot; was recorded by the Superjesus in Atlanta, Georgia from April 1997. Their debut five-track extended play, &quot;Eight Step Rail&quot;, was released in August 1996 via Aloha Records, two of its tracks are &quot;Shut My Eyes&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Stained&quot;. After touring with visiting British band, Bush in late 1996 and performing at the 1997 Big Day Out Festival, the Superjesus began work on the album. In an August 1997 interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, guitarist Chris Tennent stated, &quot;We did the Bush tour and the Big Day Out. Then we took time out to get some songs together before recording the album.&quot; In 2018, vocalist Sarah McLeod reflected, &quot;we flew to Atlanta, Georgia to record our first full length record for our new label Warner. We chose Triclops Studios because that&#x27;s where the Smashing Pumpkins recorded our favourite record, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;. Once it was in the can, we came back to Australia and were asked to play at the [1997] ARIAs.&quot;

Both &quot;I&#x27;m Stained&quot; and &quot;Shut My Eyes&quot; were re-recorded for &quot;Sumo&quot;, with &quot;Shut My Eyes&quot; as a hidden track. McLeod and Tennent were dating prior to recording the album, Tennent was &quot;writing songs which he recorded, complete with all the guitar parts, onto a tape&quot; and McLeod &quot;spent a considerable time familiarising herself with the songs. She was still writing lyrics on the plane bound for Atlanta.&quot; By the time it was released McLeod and Tennent&#x27;s personal relationship was over however they continued in the band. Two singles appeared ahead of the album, &quot;Down Again&quot; (August 1997) and &quot;Saturation&quot; (November). Its third single, &quot;Now and Then&quot; was issued in March 1998. The fourth single, &quot;Ashes&quot;, followed in September. The group provided a track-by-track description of the album for &quot;The iZine&quot; in February 1998. The Sumo Tour of Australia, with over 40 dates, occurred from mid-February to late April. They started the tour with an appearance on national youth radio Triple J&#x27;s program &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot; in Sydney, where they recorded tracks live-in-the-studio. &quot;Sumo&quot; was released in the United States in July 1998 and the Superjesus relocated to Los Angeles to promote it. Upon return to Australia Tennent left the Superjesus and was replaced on guitar by Tim Henwood in July 1999.

==Reception==

Jonathan Lewis from AllMusic wrote: &quot;&quot;Sumo&quot; was full of guitar-driven alternative radio-friendly songs.&quot; adding &quot;Opening with the Helmet-style riffing of the excellent &quot;Down Again&quot;, the Superjesus show that guitar rock with McLeod&#x27;s vocals soaring over the top is definitely their strength. It is also their weakness, with &quot;Sumo&quot; containing too little variation in style.&quot; Lewis said &quot;While the first half of Sumo shows plenty of promise, the second half loses its intensity.&quot;

<text>Eight Step Rail is the debut EP by Australian rock band The Superjesus. The EP was released in May 1996.

The track &quot;I&#x27;m Stained&quot; was later re-recorded for their debut album, &quot;Sumo&quot;. A re-recorded version of &quot;Shut My Eyes&quot; was also later included as a hidden track on &quot;Sumo&quot;.

The big guitar sounds are yet another use of the infamous Sansamp from Tech 21. After the engineer (Mick Wordley of Mixmasters Studios in Adelaide, Australia) spent a day trying to get a big sound out of Marshall stacks, he could not go past the sound the band had achieved by direct injecting a Sansamp into their Fostex recorder.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997, the EP won two ARIA Awards, &quot;Best New Talent&quot; and &quot;Breakthrough Artist – Single&quot;.

<text>Pixy Stix are a sweet and sour colored powdered candy usually packaged in a wrapper that resembles a drinking straw.

The candy is lightly poured into the mouth from the wrapper, which is made out of either plastic or paper. Pixy Stix contain dextrose, citric acid, and artificial and natural flavors.

== History ==
Pixy Stix were invented by the Sunline Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. The concept for this powdered candy originated in 1942 and was derived from a penny drink mix sold as Fruzola Jr. by the Fruzola Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. When J. Fish Smith found that children were eating the sweet and sour powder straight from the package, he modified the formula and branded it as Lik-M-Aid.

An affiliated company, Fruzola Company of St. Louis, which later became Sunline, Inc., was founded in 1952 by Menlo F. Smith to manufacture and market Lik-M-Aid nationwide. In 1959, the product was packaged in color-striped straws and introduced as Pixy Stix. Several years later, Lik-M-Aid was modified with a multi-compartment package containing two flavors and a candy stick used to dip the candy out of the package, thereby dubbed Fun Dip. Pixy Stix are currently manufactured by Ferrara Candy Company, a division of Ferrero SpA. 

In 2011, Pixy Stix was one of the candies considered a health threat by a Grand Rapids middle school, and was banned out of concern that children could use the candy to learn the habit of using illicit drugs. Inhaling the powdery candy also could increase the risk of upper sinus and upper respiratory system infections.

<text>Charles Thomas Johnston (born August 15, 1948) is an American musician. He is a guitarist and vocalist, known principally as a founder, guitarist, lead vocalist and songwriter for the rock group the Doobie Brothers, as well as for his own solo career. He has played off and on with the Doobie Brothers for 50 years, in several styles.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Doobie Brothers in 2020.

==Musical career==
Johnston is most well known for both his lead guitar and vocal role in the Doobie Brothers, as well as for his adaptation of his own acoustic guitar style, blending a unique strum and percussive accented rhythm at the same time on one instrument. This style, interwoven with melodic hammer-ons, gave Johnston an early signature sound in popular 1970s rock music. All the rhythm structures behind &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Listen to the Music&quot; were formulated first for an acoustic guitar, and then re-applied in similar style on an electric guitar.

===Early years to 1975===
Johnston was born in Visalia, California. His greatest musical influences during his youth included Little Richard, Bo Diddley, Elvis Presley, James Brown, and other rhythm and blues artists featured on the radio in the 1950s. After brief school stints with the saxophone and clarinet, at the age of twelve Johnston took up guitar. He said, &quot;I started out [on] the clarinet at seven, and I played that for eight years. I also played the saxophone for three years, drums for a year and a half, and took up the guitar when I was in the seventh grade. That was pretty much of a rebellion/image trip. But I felt at home on the guitar. I loved the saxophone and played tenor and baritone. But unfortunately, when I hung the clarinet up, I hung up all the reed instruments and just started playing guitar, and I never touched them again. I taught myself guitar and a little piano at home. I played piano on the first album &quot;The Doobie Brothers&quot;, and a little harmonica on a few others.&quot; In his early career he played in a variety of bands, including a Mexican wedding band that played half soul and half Latin music. His interest in rhythm and blues led to his singing in a soul group from a neighboring town and, eventually, his own blues band.

Johnston moved to San Jose to finish college and started playing in bands around town. It was there that he met Skip Spence, a former drummer with Jefferson Airplane, and guitarist/founding member of a group that had a major influence on the Doobie Brothers – Moby Grape. Spence introduced Johnston to John Hartman. Johnston was a graphic design art major at San José State University and wound up living at 285 South 12th Street, which was a musical center for San Jose at the time. &quot;It didn&#x27;t matter if they played B-3 or drums, guitar, bass, or horns, they all ended up in our basement,&quot; Johnston recalls. Johnston and Hartman soon formed their own band, Pud, featuring Greg Murphy on bass. Pud played many clubs in and around San Jose, including the Golden Horn Lounge (which no longer exists) in Cupertino, California. Here they met Pat Simmons. Hartman and Johnston lived in the 12th Street house for about four years; whereupon Dave Shogren joined them to replace Greg Murphy and Pat Simmons was recruited, they had the nucleus of a new band, and Pud gave way to the Doobie Brothers.

Throughout much of an initial seven-year and six-album discography, Johnston wrote and sang many of the Doobie Brothers&#x27; early hits, including &quot;Listen to the Music&quot; (#11 Top 100 Billboard Hit −1972), &quot;Rockin&#x27; Down the Highway,&quot; &quot;China Grove&quot; (#15 Billboard Hot 100 Hit), &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot; (#8 Billboard Hot 100 Hit), &quot;Another Park, Another Sunday&quot; (#32 Billboard Hot 100 Hit), and &quot;Eyes of Silver&quot; (#52 Billboard Hot 100 Hit). He also sang the hit song &quot;Take Me in Your Arms&quot; (#11 Billboard Hot 100 Hit −1975) (written by Holland-Dozier-Holland).

===Mid and solo years 1976–1987===
In December 1973, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported the relatively trivial news that Johnston had been arrested in California on a charge of marijuana possession. More seriously however, following years of a road touring lifestyle and health issues surrounding stomach ulcers which stood as a challenge since high school, Johnston became severely ill on the eve of a major tour beginning in Memphis, Tennessee in 1975 to promote &quot;Stampede&quot;. Johnston&#x27;s condition was so precarious that he required emergency hospitalization for a bleeding ulcer. With Johnston convalescing and the tour already underway, fellow Doobie Brother Jeff Baxter proposed recruiting a fellow Steely Dan alum to fill the hole. This led to the emergency hiring of Michael McDonald, who became the lead singer of the band. Restored to fitness in 1976 and briefly back in the band, Johnston contributed one original song to &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot; (&quot;Turn It Loose&quot;), and also added a vocal cameo to Pat Simmons&#x27; tune &quot;Wheels of Fortune&quot;. He also made live appearances with the band in 1976 (appearing in a concert filmed that year at Winterland in San Francisco, excerpts from which appear occasionally on VH1 Classic), but was sidelined once again in the fall due to exhaustion. None of Johnston&#x27;s songs appeared on &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Fault Line&quot;, though he had written and the band had recorded five of his compositions for the album. Finally, before &quot;Fault Line&quot; was released, Johnston had his songs removed and left the band that he co-founded (though he received credit for guitars and vocals and was pictured on the album&#x27;s inner sleeve band photo). After a few years of restored health but growing differences in musical direction between band members, Johnston finally left the band in 1977 to pursue a solo career that produced two albums with Warner Bros: &quot;Everything You&#x27;ve Heard Is True&quot; and &quot;Still Feels Good&quot; (reissued on compact disc by Wounded Bird Records), and Billboard Hot 100 hit &quot;Savannah Nights&quot; (#34 Top 100 Billboard Hit −1980).

Johnston toured in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the Tom Johnston Band, which featured fellow Doobie John Hartman on drums. While working on his solo projects, in 1982 Johnston rejoined the band for a farewell tour concert, after which the Doobie Brothers ceased performing as a band for the next five years.

In 1985, Johnston toured US clubs with a group called Border Patrol, that also included former Doobies Michael Hossack and briefly Patrick Simmons. This group toured but never recorded. In 1987, he contributed a tune to the &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; soundtrack entitled &quot;Where Are You Tonight?&quot;

===Current years 1987–present===
Johnston joined the Doobie Brothers when they reunited for a brief tour in 1987. This event led to the permanent reformation of the band, with Johnston again performing alongside co-founder Simmons. With Simmons, Johnston wrote &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;: Our Story of the Doobie Brothers&quot; (2022).

==Road and studio gear outfitting==
&quot;Mine [first guitar] was an arch-back Harmony acoustic with f-holes. After that I got a Kay single-pickup electric with a cheap amplifier as that&#x27;s all I could afford. Johnston now owns a mid-50s Fender Stratocaster that has been in his collection since the 1970s. He has a 1970 Les Paul Deluxe goldtop with classic white P-90 &#x27;soapbar&#x27; pickups affixed with an American Flag, that has been his primary Les Paul for 40 years. He also relies upon a 2008 PRS Custom 24 as a touring backup for his primary PRS. His primary touring guitar is a 2009 PRS 25th Anniversary Custom 24. It has a Modern Eagle inlay on the headstock and 57/08 pickups. &quot;I&#x27;ve got a lot of guitars. Basically, everything I use on the road is PRS and that is what I play live. I use two basic guitars live that I trade off and I have a Martin acoustic that I play as well live. It is pretty much all about Paul Reed Smith right now. At home I have a Stratocaster and I have some older guitars I have had for a long time, an old Les Paul, an old 335, a couple Strats and a Telecaster. But live and when I am out on the road, it is strictly PRS.&quot;

While primarily an electric guitarist, Johnston also plays acoustic guitars for exploration and song writing. He started with a Gibson J-50 which was used to record all acoustic guitar parts on the first four Doobie Brother albums and after it was stolen moved to Martin guitars. In his personal collection are a 1962 Martin 00–18 and a 1975 Martin D-42, and he has written various songs on the 00-18. Johnston uses a variety of software in his home studio for writing, and Digital Performer by MOTU as his recording software program.

Johnston has employed traditionally a three finger Clapton-Hendrix lead fingerstyle, only using all four fingers for barre chords. He said, &quot;I use my little finger to play chords, but not for playing solos. The direction in which I bend a string depends on where the string I&#x27;m bending is on the neck. The lower strings are going to be pulled down, and the high strings are going to be pushed up. I use a lot of vibrato when I play solo. And for picking, it has to be up and down if you want to do a lot of speed. It&#x27;s also better for clarity. Anything faster than quarter notes, you either have to use alternating picking or play with a regular flatpick and fingers.&quot;

Johnston has traditionally employed Herco Nylon Flex 50 flatpicks (old &quot;Herco mediums&quot;), allowing for the right combination of flex and durability for his chukka-style rhythm. He said &quot;I always use Herco medium because they don&#x27;t break, and they take forever to wear out. Actually the worst thing you can do with a Herco is lose it. They are easy to hold on to as well and I do sweat a lot playing live. In fact, I usually eat the nickel off the strings right down to the brass (circa 1976).&quot;

In 2007 C.F. Martin &amp; Co. released a limited run of 35 Tom Johnston Signature Edition Doobie-42 Artist Edition guitars, and Elderly Music Tom Johnston Doobie 42.

<doc id="656112" wikidata="Q983125" url="?curid=656112" title="Francisco Balagtas">
<text>Francisco Balagtas y de la Cruz (April 2, 1788 – February 20, 1862), commonly known as Francisco Balagtas and also as Francisco Baltazar, was a Filipino poet and litterateur of the Tagalog language during the Spanish rule of the Philippines. He is widely considered one of the greatest Filipino literary laureates for his impact on Filipino literature. The famous epic &quot;Florante at Laura&quot; is regarded as his defining work.

Balagtas adopted the legal surname Baltazar in fulfillment of the edict issued by Governor-General Narciso Claveria y Zaldua in 1849 that mandated the native population to adopt standard surnames. The name is commonly misspelled as Baltazar and sometimes misinterpreted as his pen name.

== Early life ==
Francisco Balagtas was born in Barrio Panginay, Bigaa, Bulacan, as the youngest of the four children of Juan Balagtas, a blacksmith, and Juana de la Cruz. He studied in a parochial school in Bigaa and later in Manila. He later worked as a houseboy in Pondi, Manila.

== Life as a poet ==
Balagtas learned to write poetry from José de la Cruz (&quot;Huseng Sisiw&quot;), one of the most famous poets of Tondo, in return for chicks. It was De la Cruz himself who personally challenged Balagtas to improve his writing. Balagtas swore he would overcome Huseng Sisiw as he would not ask for anything in return as a poet.

In 1835, Balagtas moved to Pandacan, Manila, where he met María Asunción Rivera, who would effectively serve as the muse for his future works. She is referenced in his work &quot;Florante at Laura&quot; as &#x27;Selya&#x27; and &#x27;MAR&#x27;.

Balagtas&#x27; affections for MAR were challenged by the influential Mariano Capule. The latter won the battle for MAR when he used his wealth to get Balagtas imprisoned. It was here that he wrote &quot;Florante at Laura&quot;—in fact, the events of this poem were meant to parallel his situation.

He wrote his poems in the Tagalog language, during an age when Filipino writing was predominantly written in Spanish.

Balagtas published &quot;Florante at Laura&quot; upon his release in 1838. He moved to Balanga, Bataan, in 1840 where he served as the assistant to the justice of the peace. He was also appointed as the translator of the court. He married Juana Tiambeng on July 22, 1842, in a ceremony officiated by Fr. Cayetano Arellano, uncle of the future chief justice to the Supreme Court of the Philippines Chief Justice Arellano. They had eleven children, but only four survived to adulthood. On November 21, 1849, Governor General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua issued a decree that every Filipino native had to adopt a surname. In 1856, he was appointed as the major lieutenant, but soon after was convicted and sent to prison again in Bataan under the accusation that he ordered Alferez Lucas&#x27; housemaid&#x27;s head to be shaved.

He sold his land and all of his riches, for him to be put out of imprisonment in 1861. He then continued writing poetry, along with translating Spanish documents, but he died a year later—on February 20, 1862, at the age of 73. On his deathbed, he asked the favor that none of his children become poets like him, who had suffered under his gift as well as under others. He even went as far as to tell them it would be better to cut their hands off than let them be writers.

Balagtas is greatly idolized in the Philippines that the term for Filipino debate in extemporaneous verse is named after him: &quot;Balagtasan&quot;.

== Legacy ==
thumb|New Balagtas Municipal Hall

An elementary school was erected in honor of Balagtas, the Francisco Balagtas Elementary School (FBES), located along Alvarez Street in Santa Cruz, Manila. There is also a plaza and park (Plaza Balagtas) erected in Pandacan, Manila, while most of the streets were named after various &quot;Florante at Laura&quot; characters in honor of Francisco Balagtas. His birthplace, Bigaa, Bulacan, was renamed to Balagtas, Bulacan, in his memory. A museum, historical marker, monument and elementary school has been placed in his birthplace at Panginay, Balagtas, Bulacan. The former Folk Arts Theater in Manila was renamed to Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas to honor Balagtas. Mercurian crater was also named after him. The barangay of Udyong in Orion, Bataan, was also renamed Balagtas.

The Philippines has released currency honoring Kiko Balagtas on the 10 centavo coin.

On April 2, 2018, Google honored Balagtas&#x27; 230th birthday celebration with a Google Doodle.

No original manuscript in Balagtas&#x27; handwriting of any of his works has survived to the present day. This is due mainly to two great fires that razed Udyong (now Balagtas in Orion, Bataan) and destroyed much of the poet&#x27;s works. The most notable of his works, &quot;Florante at Laura&quot; or &quot;Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at Laura sa Kaharian ng Albanya&quot; has been published in numerous editions from its original publication in 1838. The oldest extant edition of the Florante is believed to be the 1861 edition published in Manila, while a handwritten manuscript written down by Apolinario Mabini exists and is in the possession of the Philippine National Library.

The major source of the poet&#x27;s life and works is from a 20th-century work entitled &quot;Kun Sino ang Kumatha nang &quot;Florante&quot;&quot; (He who wrote the &quot;Florante&quot;) by Hermenegildo Cruz. The poet lists down Balagtas&#x27; works and recreates some of his plays based on scenes and lines memorized by the poet&#x27;s children. The book also has an edition of the Florante. Balagtas wrote ten &quot;comedias&quot; and one metrical romance according to Cruz as well as numerous other poems and short plays that are recorded in his book. These include two &quot;laos&quot; or short celebratory scenes usually involving a patron saint and performed during fiestas.

=== Complete works ===
Only three of Balagtas&#x27; complete works have survived to this day. Of the three, &quot;Florante at Laura&quot; is considered Balagtas&#x27; defining work and is a cultural touchstone for the Philippines.
*&quot;Florante at Laura&quot; or &quot;Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at Laura sa Kaharian ng Albanya&quot;, an &quot;awit&quot; (metrical narrative poem with dodecasyllabic quatrains [12 syllables per line, 4 lines per stanza]); Balagtas&#x27; masterpiece
*&quot;La India elegante y el negrito amante&quot; – a short play in one act
*&quot;Orosman at Zafira&quot; – a comedy in three acts

=== Reconstructed/rediscovered works ===
Majority of the source material for Balagtas&#x27; work come from Hermenegildo Cruz&#x27; book which itself is based on the surviving testimonies and memories of Balagtas&#x27; children at the turn of the century. In his book, he reconstructs four plays.
*&quot;Rodolfo at Rosemonda&quot;
*&quot;Nudo gordeano&quot;
*&quot;Abdol at Misereanan&quot; – a &quot;komedya&quot;, staged in Abucay, Bataan in 1859
*&quot;Bayaceto at Dorslica&quot; – a &quot;komedya&quot; in three parts, staged at Udyong on September 27, 1857

=== Minor works ===
As a folk poet and employee of the courts, Balagtas&#x27; prowess in writing was mainly seen in the yearly fiestas held in nearby towns, a great majority of his plays may have been staged in outdoor theaters set up in town squares and as a poet, a number of his works and writings have been recorded in collections of poetry such as the &quot;Coleccion de refranes, frases y modismos tagalos&quot; (Guadalupe, 1890) as well as in the accounts of Spanish officials such as Martínez de Zúñiga who recorded traditional plays and religious events in Philippine fiestas.

Balagtas also wrote in the Ladino style of poems that were popular among his contemporaries. He is said to have written two loas recorded in Cruz&#x27;s book as well as numerous Ladinos and didactic works.

==== Loas ====
*&quot;In praise of the Archangel Michael&quot; a &quot;loa&quot; written for the patron saint of the town of Udyong.
*&quot;In Celebration of the crowning of Queen Isabella II of the Bourbon Dynasty&quot; Celebrating the ascension of Isabella II to the Spanish throne

=== Minor poems ===
A number of Minor poems are recorded in Cruz&#x27;s book.
*&quot;Pangaral sa Isang Binibining Ikakasal&quot; (Admonition to a Young Lady About To Be Married) A didactic work.
*&quot;Paalam Na sa Iyo. . .!&quot; (And So Farewell to You... !) A bilingual poem (Written in Spanish and Tagalog) written in Ladino style.

=== Lost works ===
Five of the ten plays Balagtas wrote as recorded by Cruz are considered lost. Another work—&quot;Claus&quot; (a translation work from Latin)—is considered lost for Cruz does not mention any fragments or elaborates on it in his book, Eufronio Alip&#x27;s 1930 Tagalog literary history mentions the same book. Among his other lost works, one should consider plays and short poems written by Balagtas in his lifetime for fiestas and celebrations as well as to earn his living. Eufronio Alip, in his 1930 historical study on Tagalog literature, also provides an additional two titles of plays by Balagtas.

<doc id="656116" wikidata="Q15684647" url="?curid=656116" title="Julio Machado">
<text>Julio Segundo Machado Rondón (born December 1, 1965) is a Venezuelan former Major League Baseball (MLB) right-handed relief pitcher who played for the New York Mets (1989–1990) and Milwaukee Brewers (1990–1991). Machado&#x27;s MLB career was cut short when he was imprisoned on involuntary murder charges in Venezuela. He later coached and played in Venezuelan winter baseball leagues.

==MLB career==
Machado started his career with the Mets. He made his MLB debut in and started the season with the Mets as well. He was demoted to the Class AAA Tidewater team, where he saved eight games before being recalled to the Mets in July. At the time, the Mets were looking for consistent right-handed relief pitchers, having traded Roger McDowell the previous year.

Later that season, Machado was traded to the Brewers, along with pitcher Kevin Brown, in exchange for catcher Charlie O&#x27;Brien and a minor league player.

Machado had a decent fastball, good control and willingness to challenge hitters. He also pitched a better-than-average curveball and a slider.

In a three-year career, Machado posted a 7–5 record with 151 strikeouts and a 3.12 ERA in 147 innings.

==Shooting==
Spending the 1991 offseason in his homeland, Machado fatally shot a woman following an auto accident on December 8. More than two weeks later, Machado was missing and the Brewers said that they were planning for 1992 with the assumption that Machado would not be on the team. Though he was described as a fugitive, Venezuelan reporters said that Machado would probably turn himself in after the holidays. He was held in a Caracas prison while an investigation was carried out from the middle of January to early March. He admitted that he fired the shots, but he said that he did so in self-defense, afraid that he was being robbed.

When Machado was granted conditional freedom pending a trial on charges of involuntary murder, he was not allowed to leave Venezuela. Shortly thereafter, thieves stole the car of the prosecutor in Machado&#x27;s case and they set it on fire. Machado was convicted and, following appeals, he was sentenced to 12 years in 1996. He was released in 2000.

<text>Pont-à-Mousson () is a commune in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in north-eastern France. Its inhabitants are known as &quot;Mussipontains&quot; in French. It is an industrial town (mainly steel industry), situated on the river Moselle. Pont-à-Mousson has several historical monuments, including the 18th century Premonstratensian abbey.

==Demographics==
In 2018, 14,434 people lived in the town, while its agglomeration had a population of 23,824.

==History==

===Early Modern===
In 1572 Cardinal Charles of Lorraine established a Jesuit university at Pont-à-Mousson. With the Protestant Revolution building in the German-speaking lands, still part of the Holy Roman Empire, directly to the east, and the Duchy of Lorraine vulnerable to pressure from an increasingly assertive French state directly to the west, the Duchy participated in the wars of religion on the side of the Counter-Reformation. The Tridentine strategy promulgated by the Holy See involved the creation of a &quot;Roman Catholic backbone&quot; (sometimes termed the Lotharingian axis from the territories, including Lorraine, between France and the Habsburg Empire).

During the seventeenth century the university of Pont-à-Mousson grew rapidly until there were about 2,000 students. There were four faculties covering theology, the arts, law and medicine. Students were drawn from across western and central Europe. Over time a rivalry grew up between students in the St Martin district, located on the right-bank of the river Moselle and dominated by Jesuits, and the left-bank students based in the St Laurent quarter and considered the rowdier of the two student tribes. Rivalry peaked with the violent &quot;printers&#x27; battles&quot; when the rival factions were known respectively as the &quot;Ponti Mussoni&quot; and the &quot;Mussiponti&quot;. The &quot;Mussiponti&quot; won, and in the region the inhabitants of the town became known thereafter as &quot;Mussipontains/Mussipontines&quot;.

===18th and 19th centuries===
The Duchy of Lorraine became French following the death in 1766 of Duke Stanisław Leszczyński, and in 1769 Louis XV had the Jesuit Academy transferred to Nancy. The only notable educational establishment remaining at Pont-à-Mousson was a military training school.

The town continued to flourish as a centre of the visual arts, however, rivalling Épinal to the south in this respect. A papier-mâché factory also contributed to the cultural development of Pont-à-Mousson.

It was the regional capital between 1790 and 1795, but underwent extensive destruction in the ensuing wars, and was subject to foreign occupation in 1814 and 1815. During the Franco-Prussian War it experienced severe street fighting.

====Pont-à-Mousson Company====
The Pont-à-Mousson Company (PAM) was created in 1856 by a group of Lorraine businessmen to operate the Marbache iron mine and to use the ore to manufacture cast iron. Xavier Rogé was the manager. In 1862 the enterprise was liquidated due to lack of sufficient capital to cover the high investment expenses. Rogé managed to raise capital in the Saarland and restart the business, selling most of its production to forges in the Ardennes and Champagne.

In 1866, Rogé visited England and became aware of the new and promising market for cast-iron water pipes. He focused the company on pipe production, and found a ready market when cities began to make large investment in water supply after 1871. He adopted the English method of casting pipes in vertical rather than horizontal moulds. He was succeeded by Camille Cavallier, who transformed the moderately sized cast iron pipe manufacturer into a giant, always concentrating on making pipes. Annual cast iron production rose from 80,000 to 183,000 tons between 1900 and 1913.

The company, later known as Saint-Gobain PAM is still producing ductile cast iron pipes and fittings for drinking water, irrigation and sewage applications; its logo still reflects the multi-arched bridge over the river. The plant of Pont-à-Mousson, having its 160th anniversary in 2016, is the largest employer in the city, with an average 1000 employees spread among two plants, a research center and the headquarters of the company.

===20th century===
Strategically positioned at an important river crossing, Pont-à-Mousson and the surrounding region saw terrible fighting during the twentieth century wars between France and Germany. In the World War I fighting at Bois-le-Prêtre, Croix des Carmes, and Grand-Couronné are names that recall savage fighting between French and German soldiers. The town suffered further destruction in 1944, before being liberated by the U.S. Third Army under the command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton, supported by an active local resistance movement.

In 1921 the President personally presented the town with the Croix de guerre, and shortly after this Désiré Ferry, the local deputy, was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur. After World War II, Pont-à-Mousson was again honoured, this time with the Croix de Guerre.

* Guarinus of Sitten (1065–1150), saint and bishop of Sion

<doc id="656138" wikidata="Q3088503" url="?curid=656138" title="María Nsué Angüe">
<text>María Pilar Nsue Angüe Osa (1945 or 1950 – 18 January 2017) was a noted Equatoguinean writer and Minister of Education and Culture.

==Background and early life==
María was born in Bidjabidjan, Río Muni. Her family immigrated to Spain when she was a child where she studied literature. Born to ethnic Fang parents, she emigrated with her family to Spain when she was only eight years old. In narrating her own life, Maria Nsue often underscored the primal and formative impact of colonial interventions. She claimed to have been born in jail, in 1948, in the city of Bata, where her parents had been confined for resisting the authority of the colonial regime. She belonged to the Essasom tribe. She was the only child of José Nsue Angüe Osa and Alfonsina Mangue. Her father was an anticolonial and proindependence leader. She spent her early childhood in Bidjabidján as a result of the arbitrary delineations of European colonial cartographers and policy makers. At the age of eight, Maria Nsue was entrusted to a Protestant missionary family temporarily assigned to the local mission. This is the family that later took her to Madrid. She spent her youth under the Francoist regime. She would eventually return to Equatorial Guinea in her twenties after the country&#x27;s independence.

==Writings==
Her 1985 novel, and most acclaimed work, &quot;Ekomo&quot; was the first novel written by an Equatoguinean woman to be published. It tells the story of a Fang woman and her husband. &quot;Ekomo&quot; is considered a work that changes the way one views the world. Equatorial Guinea which once belonged to Spain gained its independence in 1968 and then fell under a military dictatorship. La Guinea Española is the beginning of Guinean literature where many works were published reflecting on the connections and the clash between Guinean, Spanish, and Latin American cultures. Ekomo is considered Hispano-African Literature which differs from Afro-Hispanic literature. Nnange is the main character of the novel writing after the death of her husband Ekomo. She tells of the struggles of attempting to find a cure for her husband&#x27;s illness. She then begins reflecting on a woman&#x27;s place in society and her current position as an outcast without a husband or children. &quot;Ekomo&quot; is the first novel written by a woman in Equatorial Guinea.

Constant themes in her writing are the oppression of women and the consequences of colonization.

== Works ==

===Poetry, articles and poems===

Nsué Angüe also wrote several short stories, articles and poems. Frequent topics addressed in her work involve women&#x27;s rights and post-colonial African society. Much of her work is inspired by popular Fang literature. In addition to Ekomo, she is the author of a volume of short stories entitled Relatos (1999), largely based on traditional Fang stories of rural life, told as if from the perspective of a grandmother, but intertwined with an unrelenting criticism of the politico-economic situation in her country. Similarly rooted in tradition, but integrating percussion and live performance through the application of modern technologies, is the CD-ROM project  Mbayah, o la leyenda del sauce llorón (Mbayah, or the Legend of the Weeping Willow), released in 1997, for which she composed the narrative and music.

The magazine was started in 1970 as &quot;Midlands Beat&quot; by promoter and band-manager Jim Simpson, who sold it to its latter editor, Steve Morris, who in turn relaunched it in newspaper format as &quot;The Beat&quot;, before converting it into a website.

It took its original name from the term coined in the late 1950s to collectively describe the city&#x27;s music scene, in the manner of the Mersey sound.

It has been suggested that The Moody Blues, formed in May 1964, were the first of the &quot;Brum Beat&quot; bands to become internationally famous. other bands such as the Spencer Davis Group were members of the Brum Beat scene.
