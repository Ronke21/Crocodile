<text>David Michael Bautista Jr. (born January 18, 1969) is an American actor and retired professional wrestler. Regarded as one of the most prolific professional wrestlers of his generation, he rose to fame for his multiple stints in WWE between 2002 and 2019.

Bautista began his wrestling career in 1999 and signed with WWE (then WWF) in 2000. From 2002 to 2010, he gained fame under the ring name Batista, initially as a member of Evolution.

== Early life ==
David Michael Bautista Jr. was born in Washington, D.C., on January 18, 1969, the son of Donna Raye () and hairdresser David Michael Bautista. His mother is of Greek descent, while his father was born to Filipino immigrants. His paternal grandfather served in the Philippine military, worked as a taxi driver and barber, and held other jobs to feed the family. Bautista&#x27;s mother later came out as a lesbian. He has said that he lived in poverty and had a hard life which included exposure to violent crime at an early age. Before reaching the age of nine, two bodies had been found on his front lawn and another one nearby. As young as age 13, he had begun stealing cars. By age 17, he was estranged from his parents and living on his own. However, he later said, &quot;I am proud of my parents. They are good, honest, hard-working folks. They taught me the values of working hard.&quot;

Bautista worked as a nightclub bouncer until he was arrested after a fight that left two patrons injured, one of whom was knocked unconscious. After a trial, he was sentenced to one year of probation. He worked as a lifeguard before deciding to pursue a career in bodybuilding, which he credits with saving his life. At the age of 30, after having a breakdown from the shame he felt for having to ask a co-worker to lend him money so he could buy Christmas presents for his children, he saw how lucrative a career in professional wrestling could be and decided to pursue it.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Training and early career (1999–2000) ===
Bautista tried out at World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Power Plant, where trainer DeWayne Bruce told him he would never make it in the wrestling business. He then went to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), who advised him to train with Afa Anoaʻi at the Wild Samoan Training Center, where he trained and later competed in Anoaʻi&#x27;s World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) promotion. He wrestled his debut match under the ring name Khan on October 30, 1999, less than three months before his 31st birthday. He also trained with Marrese Crump in Muay Thai and Eskrima.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (2000–2010) ===

==== Ohio Valley Wrestling (2000–2002) ====
Upon signing with the WWF in 2000, Bautista was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), a WWF developmental territory. He made his OVW debut later that year under the ring name Leviathan, where he immediately joined forces with Synn. As a member of the &quot;Disciples of Synn&quot; stable, he went undefeated until being beaten at &quot;Christmas Chaos&quot; by Kane with help from Stone Cold Steve Austin. He later won the OVW Heavyweight Championship from &quot;The Machine&quot; Doug Basham before losing the belt to The Prototype. A few months later, Bautista left OVW after he was promoted to WWE&#x27;s main roster.

==== Early storylines (2002–2003) ====
While still in OVW, Bautista began appearing on non-televised WWE events. He began his televised WWE career on May 9, 2002, on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as Deacon Batista, a heel enforcer for Reverend D-Von. He made his WWE in-ring debut in a tag team match teaming with D-Von against Faarooq and Randy Orton, pinning Orton. Over several weeks, Orton tried to beat D-Von and Batista with different partners, but ultimately lost each time. Batista suffered his first loss in a match against Rikishi after D-Von accidentally punched him, allowing Rikishi to take advantage and pin Batista. Batista and D-Von argued over the forthcoming weeks, with Batista eventually turning on D-Von. On the November 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Batista defeated D-Von to end their feud. After splitting with D-Von, he was assigned to the Raw brand and was renamed Batista. He aligned himself with Ric Flair and feuded with Kane, whom he defeated at Armageddon on December 15.

==== Evolution (2003–2005) ====

In January 2003, Batista joined Triple H, Ric Flair and Randy Orton to form the heel stable Evolution. Batista, however, was sidelined for much of 2003 after he tore his right triceps muscle at a &quot;Raw&quot; live event in a tag team match alongside Orton against The Dudley Boyz. While training after the injury, Batista re-tore his triceps, extending his stay on the sidelines. Batista made his return on the October 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, interfering in a match between Goldberg and Shawn Michaels. At Armageddon on December 14, Batista and Ric Flair became the World Tag Team Champions after winning a Tag Team Turmoil match, while Triple H won the World Heavyweight Championship and Randy Orton the Intercontinental Championship. Batista and Flair held the titles until the February 16, 2004, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when they were defeated by Booker T and Rob Van Dam. They later defeated Booker T and Van Dam on the March 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to regain the titles before losing them to Chris Benoit and Edge on the April 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

In late 2004, the relationship between Batista and Triple H began to deteriorate in kayfabe. After a loss to Chris Jericho, Triple H verbally insulted Batista. Batista teased leaving Evolution that night, but declared that he was still part of Evolution and that they tricked everyone. Despite this ploy, Batista began behaving more like a face over the next few weeks in comparison to Evolution&#x27;s heel tactics. One particular moment saw Batista express disgust as Triple H and Ric Flair boasted about how they had intimidated and/or beat up Jim Ross, Danny Hodge, and Stacy Keibler. Regardless, he continued to show his loyalty to Triple H and Evolution by running down to the ring and assisting them in matches.

As 2005 began, Triple H realized the possibility of Batista becoming a threat to his World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H suggested that he not enter the Royal Rumble on January 30, claiming that it would be selfish of him to do so, and to simply focus on Triple H retaining the title. Batista entered anyway and went on to win the Rumble earning the right to participate in the main event of WrestleMania 21 on April 3 against the World Champion of his choice. On the February 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, in an attempt to persuade Batista to challenge WWE Champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) and challenger John Cena in a triple-threat match rather than him, Triple H concocted a scheme to have Batista run over in a limousine resembling the one used by JBL. Initially, Batista did not want help from Evolution and wanted to confront JBL by himself. Triple H insisted that Evolution stick together and accompanied Batista anyway, saving him from the oncoming vehicle. Batista became aware of the plot while sneakily eavesdropping on fellow Evolution members and signed a contract guaranteeing him a match with the World Heavyweight Champion Triple H at WrestleMania 21, thus leaving Evolution and officially turning face. Batista initially pretended that he would sign with SmackDown!, giving Triple H and Flair the &quot;thumbs up&quot;, but turned it into a &quot;thumbs down&quot; before attacking the pair. He emphasized his departure by powerbombing Triple H through the table used for the contract signing.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2005–2008) ====

Batista won the World Heavyweight Championship on April 3 by defeating Triple H in the main event of WrestleMania 21. WrestleMania 21 received 1.09 million pay-per-view buys worldwide – the then-highest ever number of buys for any non-boxing pay-per-view. Batista&#x27;s match with Triple H was described by sports journalist Dave Meltzer as &quot;the peak of one of [WWE&#x27;s] best storylines in years&quot;. Batista won a rematch with Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Backlash. After Batista retained his title against Edge on the May 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he was betrayed by Ric Flair, who helped Triple H viciously attack Batista as Triple H challenged Batista to a Hell in a Cell match at Vengeance. Batista won the match at Vengeance, retaining his title yet again. With this win, Batista became the first wrestler to pin Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match.

On the June 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Batista was drafted to the SmackDown! brand as the last pick in the 2005 WWE Draft Lottery, making a surprise appearance to thwart John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL), who was celebrating his victory in a six-man elimination match to crown the inaugural &quot;SmackDown! Champion&quot;. JBL defeated Batista at The Great American Bash by disqualification after the referee saw Batista use a steel chair. They had a rematch at SummerSlam in a No Holds Barred match in which Batista pinned JBL. The feud culminated in a Texas Bull Rope match on the September 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; with Batista retaining his championship. Soon after retaining the title in a feud with Eddie Guerrero at No Mercy, WWE.com reported that Batista suffered a muscle tear in his back at the taping for the November 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; due to a double chokeslam from Big Show and Kane. Plans had been made for Batista to defend the title in a Triple Threat match with Eddie Guerrero and Randy Orton on the November 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, but the match did not take place due to the unexpected death of Guerrero on November 13, the date of the taping. Batista paid homage to Guerrero during the &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot; tribute shows dedicated to Guerrero&#x27;s memory.

Batista led Team SmackDown! against Team Raw in an inter-brand feud before Survivor Series. The feud saw Big Show and Kane chokeslamming Batista several more times in the weeks leading up to Survivor Series in an on-camera explanation for Batista&#x27;s injury. Batista ultimately helped his team win the match at Survivor Series. After Batista saved Rey Mysterio from Big Show and Kane on the December 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, leading to a match with Mysterio teaming with Batista to face Big Show and Kane at Armageddon.

On December 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Batista and Mysterio defeated WWE Tag Team Champions MNM to win the titles in a match they dedicated to Eddie Guerrero, and thus Batista became a double champion. After this, the clash with Big Show and Kane at Armageddon turned into a Champions vs. Champions encounter. Batista and Mysterio lost to Big Show and Kane at Armageddon. Two weeks later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, MNM defeated Batista and Mysterio after help from the returning Mark Henry to regain the WWE Tag Team Championship. During the interference, Henry attacked Batista, and performed his &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Slam&quot;. The teams met again in a steel cage match the following week that Henry also became involved in, and Batista and Mysterio were defeated again. Batista tore his right triceps during a match with Mark Henry at a house show on January 6, forcing him to vacate the World Heavyweight Championship at the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; tapings on January 13, two days after surpassing Triple H&#x27;s previous mark of 280 days for longest reigning champion. In his book, &quot;Batista Unleashed&quot;, Batista said that he believed that Henry was &quot;careless&quot; during their match as he never gave Batista any warning that the move was coming. Batista went on to have successful surgery on his arm on January 12.
Batista made an appearance at No Way Out and told the crowd that once his arm had healed he would return to regain the World Heavyweight Championship. At WrestleMania 22, he interrupted a Randy Orton interview, putting SmackDown! on notice that the World Heavyweight Championship would return to him by WrestleMania 23.

Batista made his official return during the July 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; immediately calling out and entering into a feud with Mark Henry. At &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXIII&quot;, Batista won a six-man tag match with teammates Rey Mysterio and Bobby Lashley, defeating World Heavyweight Champion King Booker, Finlay, and Mark Henry. Henry was legitimately injured and was ruled out of the scheduled match between the two at The Great American Bash, thus further delaying a potential feud between the two after being delayed by Batista&#x27;s initial injury.

Batista put out an open challenge to replace the injured Henry, which was answered by Mr. Kennedy. At The Great American Bash, Batista lost this match via disqualification for failing to stop choking Mr. Kennedy into the turnbuckle with his boot, but continued to attack Kennedy resulting in a laceration on his forehead so severe that it exposed his cranium and required more than 20 stitches to close. Batista lost another match with Kennedy via count out in a rematch on the July 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; before finally defeating Kennedy by pinfall on the August 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

Batista faced Big Show for the ECW World Championship on the August 1 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, winning the match by disqualification but failing to win the championship as titles cannot change hands by disqualification. He then set his sights on King Booker&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship, with the two facing in a match for the title at 2006 SummerSlam on August 20. However, Batista also won this match by disqualification. During a commercial shoot for the SummerSlam pay-per-view, Booker T and Batista reportedly got into a legitimate fistfight, with Booker T accusing Batista of considering himself superior to the rest of the roster due to his quick climb to main-event status. It was also reported that some wrestlers on the SmackDown brand agreed with Booker T. Batista continued his pursuit of the championship, failing to capture it once again in a fatal-four way at No Mercy in October also involving Finlay and Bobby Lashley, before finally defeating King Booker to regain the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series on November 26. The following month at Armageddon, Batista teamed with John Cena to defeat King Booker and Finlay, putting an end to the rivalry.
Going into 2007, Batista began a short feud with Mr. Kennedy over the championship. Batista retained the championship over Kennedy at the Royal Rumble on January 28. Batista&#x27;s next challenger was The Undertaker, the winner of the Royal Rumble match. The two formed a reluctant alliance to face John Cena and Shawn Michaels at No Way Out in February, which they lost after Batista turned on Undertaker midway through the match. At WrestleMania 23 on April 1, Batista lost the World Heavyweight Championship to The Undertaker. They continued their feud with a Last Man Standing match at Backlash later that month, which ended in a draw. The two wrestled again in a Steel Cage Match on the May 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which also ended in a draw. Following the match, Edge took advantage and won the title from The Undertaker by cashing in his Money in the Bank contract. Afterward, Batista challenged Edge unsuccessfully for the World Heavyweight Championship at Judgment Day, One Night Stand (in a Steel Cage Match), and (in a Last Chance match). The loss at Vengeance stipulated that Batista could no longer get another chance at the World Heavyweight Championship while Edge remained champion.

Batista accepted an open challenge from The Great Khali at The Great American Bash. Edge relinquished the title due to an injury the week before The Great American Bash, and Khali became the new World Heavyweight Champion, winning a Battle Royal and eliminating Batista. Batista and Kane, Edge&#x27;s title opponent, faced Khali at The Great American Bash in a Triple Threat match where Khali retained the title. Batista received a disqualification victory against Khali at SummerSlam after Khali used a steel chair, thus Khali retained the title again. Batista finally claimed his third World Heavyweight Championship after eight consecutive attempts, by defeating Khali in a triple threat match that included Rey Mysterio at Unforgiven. His first challenge was from The Great Khali in a Punjabi Prison Match at No Mercy where Batista retained his title. He won the match by leaping from the inner bamboo structure to the outer one, shortening his escape route and beating Khali to the floor.

After the return of The Undertaker at Unforgiven, the duo reignited their feud at Cyber Sunday where the fans chose Stone Cold Steve Austin as the Special Guest Referee. Batista pinned The Undertaker after two Batista Bombs. The feud continued with a Hell in a Cell match at Survivor Series. During the match, Edge returned and interfered by giving The Undertaker a con-chair-to. He then pulled an unconscious Batista on top of The Undertaker for the pinfall to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. At Armageddon, Edge won a Triple Threat match, alongside The Undertaker for Batista&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship.
Batista appeared in the Royal Rumble and made the final three before being eliminated by Triple H. At No Way Out, he was part of the SmackDown Elimination Chamber Match and eliminated Big Daddy V, but was last eliminated by The Undertaker. At WrestleMania XXIV, he defeated Umaga in an interpromotional match. After Shawn Michaels defeated Ric Flair in a Career Threatening match (forcing Flair to retire) later that night, Batista began a feud with Michaels, calling him selfish and egotistical. The two faced off at Backlash with Chris Jericho as the special guest referee. Michaels won after faking a knee injury and performing Sweet Chin Music. Batista then defeated Michaels at One Night Stand in a stretcher match, thus ending their feud.

On the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista was drafted from SmackDown to the Raw brand during the 2008 WWE Draft. After failing to win the World Heavyweight Championship from Edge at Night of Champions, Batista attacked Edge the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, allowing CM Punk to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on Edge. This set up a title match between Batista and Punk at The Great American Bash which ended in a double disqualification after Kane interfered and attacked both men. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista and Punk had a rematch, Batista won by disqualification after he was attacked by JBL. As John Cena came to the ring to fight JBL, he inadvertently punched Batista as JBL ducked. This started a program between Cena and Batista leading up to SummerSlam, for which a match was made official by Raw general manager Mike Adamle. This was the first time a match between the two would occur as they had each been on separate brands since they both debuted in 2002. On the August 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista and Cena won the World Tag Team Championship from Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, making Batista a three-time World Tag Team Champion. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista and Cena lost the World Tag Team Championship back to Rhodes and DiBiase. After losing the titles, the two had to be separated by multiple officials. Batista defeated Cena at SummerSlam, legitimating injuring Cena&#x27;s neck in the process. Batista then competed in the World Heavyweight Championship championship scramble match at Unforgiven and was eight seconds away from being a four-time world champion, but Chris Jericho snuck in and pinned Kane in the waning seconds. On October 26 at Cyber Sunday, Batista defeated Jericho for his fourth World Heavyweight Championship in a match in which Stone Cold Steve Austin was voted in as the special guest referee. Batista&#x27;s reign, however, only lasted eight days when Jericho won the title back in a Steel Cage match on the 800th episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on November 3.

Batista then entered a feud with former Evolution partner, Randy Orton; at Survivor Series, Batista led a team of himself, CM Punk, Kofi Kingston, Matt Hardy, and R-Truth to face the team of Randy Orton, Shelton Benjamin, William Regal, Cody Rhodes, and Mark Henry. Orton&#x27;s team won with Orton pinning Batista, winning the match for his team. His feud with Orton continued up to Armageddon where Batista defeated Orton. On the December 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista was put into a handicap match against The Legacy with John Cena as his partner. During the match, Orton struck Batista with a punt to the head. Batista was knocked out and put out of action indefinitely due to a storyline head injury. WWE.com later reported that Batista elected to undergo surgery to repair a hamstring tear. His hamstring was injured at SummerSlam, in the same match that John Cena was forced out of action with a neck injury. He was expected to be out of action for six to eight months.

==== WWE Champion (2009–2010) ====
Batista returned on the &quot;Raw&quot; after WrestleMania 25, to save Triple H, Shane McMahon, and Vince McMahon from The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr.). Vince McMahon then scheduled Batista to team up with WWE Champion Triple H and Shane McMahon to face The Legacy at Backlash. During the match, Batista had brought out a chair, but Triple H tried to stop him, so they would not get disqualified (which would have cost Triple H the championship). This distraction, however, cost Triple H his championship, after he lost it to Orton. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista won a singles match against Big Show due to a distraction by John Cena, to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship at Judgment Day, which he won by disqualification. Batista went on to defeat Orton in a rematch at Extreme Rules in a Steel Cage match to capture his first WWE Championship. However, on the June 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista was to vacate the title due to a staged brutal attack by Orton and the Legacy. It was later revealed that Batista had suffered a legitimate torn left biceps similar to what he suffered in 2006. Legacy was given on-screen credit for his injury.

Batista returned on the September 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; with his arm still in a vice. Randy Orton, assuming Batista was retiring, claimed that he ended Batista&#x27;s career. Batista then removed his arm vice, which turned to be fake, and attacked Orton. He then stated that he would not retire, but move to SmackDown instead. Later that night, he defeated Orton in a no-holds barred match which was to be his last match on &quot;Raw&quot;.

Following his return to SmackDown, Batista defeated Unified WWE Tag Team Champions Jeri-Show (Chris Jericho and Big Show) in singles competition. These two victories culminated in a tag team title match against Jeri-Show with his partner Rey Mysterio on October 4 at Hell in a Cell, which Jeri-Show won. That same month at Bragging Rights, Batista was unsuccessful in winning the World Heavyweight Championship in a Fatal Four-Way match including CM Punk, Rey Mysterio, and champion The Undertaker. During the match, Mysterio broke up Batista&#x27;s pin on The Undertaker costing him the match and the title. After the match (which The Undertaker won), Batista and Mysterio appeared to patch things up, but Batista said he was tired of coming so close only to be stabbed in the back and told Mysterio he was going to rip his head off. Batista proceeded to brutally attack Mysterio, turning heel for the first time since 2005. Batista faced Mysterio on November 22 at Survivor Series, where Batista won via referee stoppage after delivering three &quot;Batista Bomb&quot;s to Mysterio. Batista defeated Mysterio again in a street fight on the December 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. On December 13 at , Batista faced The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship in a Chairs match. Batista initially won the match and the title, but SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long reversed the decision because Batista had hit Undertaker with a low blow behind the referee&#x27;s back. The match was restarted with The Undertaker winning and retaining the championship. Five days later, Batista lost to Mysterio in a number one contenders match for the World Heavyweight Championship; Mysterio&#x27;s title match against The Undertaker on the December 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; ended as a no-contest after interference from Batista.

At the Royal Rumble in January 2010, Batista entered the Royal Rumble match at number 30, but failed to win as he was eliminated by John Cena. Batista then became involved in WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and Bret Hart&#x27;s rivalry by assisting McMahon in attacking Hart; John Cena attempted to save Hart, but was assaulted by Batista. On February 21 at Elimination Chamber, as payment for Batista attacking Hart, McMahon allowed Batista to face Cena for the WWE Championship immediately after Cena won the title in an Elimination Chamber match. Batista won the match and thus his second WWE Championship, which resulted in Batista moving back to Raw. On March 28 at WrestleMania XXVI, Batista lost the WWE Championship to John Cena in a rematch, ending his reign at 35 days. Batista received his rematch for the title in a Last Man Standing match on April 25 at Extreme Rules, but was defeated by Cena after Cena duct-taped his legs around a ring post, preventing him from standing up. Batista and Cena faced off once again for the WWE Championship on May 23 at Over the Limit, but he failed again to regain the title from Cena in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match, quitting as Cena threatened to give him the &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; off the roof of a car. Cena did so anyway, throwing Batista off of the car and through the stage below.

The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista opened the show in a wheelchair and claimed that he would be pursuing legal action against Cena and WWE for his injuries (which he revealed in 2014 to be a legitimate compression fracture of his L1 spine). His promo was interrupted by new Raw General Manager Bret Hart, who ordered he face an injured Randy Orton to qualify for a shot at WWE Championship against Cena again at the new Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view. Batista refused and quit the company after Hart named Orton winner by forfeit. His profile was subsequently moved to the alumni page on WWE&#x27;s website. He later said in an interview that he left WWE because he &quot;did not like the direction the company was going in&quot;.

=== Return to WWE (2014) ===

Batista made his return to WWE on the January 20, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Despite returning as a face and winning the Royal Rumble, the live crowd reacted negatively towards Batista&#x27;s win, as Daniel Bryan did not take part in the match. Despite a positive reaction initially upon his return, the fans in attendance at the Royal Rumble rejected Batista in favor of Bryan and continued to boo him after Roman Reigns was last eliminated. After the show went off the air, Batista mocked Bryan and gestured his middle finger at the crowd. According to Batista, he thought a return as a face was a bad idea because of the fans being so invested in Daniel Bryan&#x27;s &quot;Yes Movement&quot; storyline. At the Elimination Chamber event and on the February 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista was heavily booed by the fans during matches against Alberto Del Rio, thus resulting in Batista turning heel on the February 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. The main event of WrestleMania XXX, originally Batista versus Randy Orton for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, was changed to a triple threat match after Bryan defeated Triple H at WrestleMania. At WrestleMania, Bryan forced Batista to submit to win the title.
The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista and Orton teamed together to face The Usos for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but the match ended in a double count out. Later that night, Batista and Orton, along with Kane, attacked Bryan before he was set to defend his title against Triple H. Before Triple H could defeat Bryan, The Shield interrupted by spearing Triple H and taking out Batista, Orton and Kane, causing the match to end in a no-contest. On the April 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista, Triple H and Randy Orton came down to the ring to attack The Shield after their 11-on-3 handicap match, using the name and the theme of Evolution. At both Extreme Rules and Payback, Evolution lost to The Shield. On the June 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista quit WWE after Triple H denied him a shot at the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Batista legitimately quit the WWE due to creative differences soon after.

=== Second return to WWE (2018–2019) ===
On October 16, 2018, Batista reunited with the rest of Evolution for an appearance on &quot;SmackDown&quot;″s 1000th episode, where Batista teased a match with Triple H, as Triple H had never beaten Batista in singles competition. The storyline between them started on February 25, 2019, when Batista viciously attacked Ric Flair and repeatedly demanded &quot;give me what I want&quot; to Triple H, which became a popular phrase associated with Batista. At WrestleMania 35, Batista and Triple H would face each other in a No Holds Barred with their careers on the line, where Batista lost after interference from Ric Flair. The next day, Batista announced his retirement from professional wrestling.

On December 9, 2019, WWE officially announced that Batista would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the Class of 2020. The event was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and it was announced that the class of 2020 would be inducted alongside the class of 2021 at the 2021 event. Prior to the event, however, he was removed from the list. He tweeted to confirm his removal, citing previous obligations as the reason why he could not attend the 2021 event. He also said that WWE honored his request to induct him at a future ceremony.

==Professional wrestling style and persona==

Upon his return to WWE in 2014, Batista was heavily booed by the crowd after winning the Royal Rumble, despite playing a heroic character. In an interview with WWE.com, he said of the crowd reaction, &quot;It was weird. It wasn&#x27;t like a normal response. It was almost like a personal attack. It had to do with factors that were not in my control, factors and things that were going on in the company with other people, stuff that really had nothing to do with me. To me, it was a little frustrating, a little confusing, and, you know, I don&#x27;t want to say I completely took it personal, but I did somewhat.&quot; The fan reaction caused storyline changes, with Batista turning into a villainous character.

Batista was declared the 50th greatest wrestling villain of all time by a WWE article in 2012. WWE has also ranked him as the second best World Heavyweight Champion of all time. WWE advertised Batista as being 6 ft 6 in tall and weighing 290 pounds, both of which are different from his real height of 6 ft 4 in and unknown weight.

== Mixed martial arts career ==

After leaving WWE, Bautista attended on June 16, 2010, having previously registered an interest in competing in MMA. Five days later, he said that he would be embarking on an MMA career. He became a brown belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Cesar Gracie. Bautista and Strikeforce agreed on a price and were negotiating a contract. However, in April 2011, Bautista stated that negotiations fell through when the organization was bought by the Zuffa company.

Bautista was expected to make his MMA debut against Rashid Evans on October 6, 2012, at CES MMA: Real Pain in Providence, Rhode Island. However, on October 1, 2012, Evans was forced out of the bout after a probation violation landed him back in jail. Evans was replaced by journeyman and 40-fight veteran Vince Lucero. Bautista went on to win the fight by technical knockout (TKO) at 4:05 in the first round.

== Acting career ==
=== Early career (2006-2013) ===
Bautista has acted in several television shows as both himself and his wrestling character. He guest starred in the eighth episode of season 6 of &quot;Smallville&quot; as Aldar, an extraterrestrial who escaped from the Phantom Zone and who sucks the bones out of people for nourishment. In June 2009, he made a cameo appearance as himself on the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. In 2010, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Chuck&quot;, and also made a cameo appearance in &quot;Relative Strangers&quot;. He starred in the 2010 action film &quot;Wrong Side of Town&quot;. Bautista appeared as the villainous Brass Body in the Universal Studios film &quot;The Man with the Iron Fists&quot;.

=== Breakthrough (2014-2021) ===

He played Drax the Destroyer in the 2014 Marvel Studios film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, which was a critical and commercial success. He played Mr. Hinx in the James Bond film &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015), and starred as the villain Tong Po in the reboot of the martial arts film &quot;Kickboxer&quot;. He was widely praised for his supporting role in &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017). He reprised his role as Drax in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2019).

In 2018, Bautista joined his castmates in support of &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; director James Gunn after Gunn&#x27;s firing over old tweets joking about pedophilia and rape. He called Gunn&#x27;s firing &quot;nauseating&quot; and declared that he would ask to be recast if Disney, the parent company of Marvel Studios, did not use Gunn&#x27;s script for &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot;. Gunn was reinstated as the film&#x27;s director in March 2019. In May 2021, he confirmed that the upcoming &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; would be his final appearance as Drax.

=== Diversification (2021-present) ===
Bautista starred in &quot;Army of the Dead&quot; (2021). He had a villainous role in &quot;Dune&quot;, a film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Frank Herbert, which was released to critical and commercial success. He starred in M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s horror film &quot;Knock at the Cabin&quot; (2023). He appeared in &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot; as Duke. He is set to star in the fantasy-adventure film &quot;In the Lost Lands&quot; with Milla Jovovich, directed by Paul W. S. Anderson.

== Other media ==

Bautista appeared on the covers of the April 2005 &quot;Flex&quot;, and &quot;Muscle &amp; Fitness&quot; for September 2008. Along with John Cena and Ashley Massaro, he appeared representing WWE on an episode of &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; in January 2007, giving the kids of the family whose house was renovated WWE merchandise and eight tickets to WrestleMania 23.

According to the Wrestling Figure Checklist, Bautista had 171 action figures released in the 2000s and 2010s; most were released in the mid-to-late 2000s by Jakks Pacific. He remarked on his 2007 appearance on MTV Cribs, &quot;I was trying to collect my action figures, but I gave up, there became too many&quot;.

On October 16, 2007, his autobiography, &quot;Batista Unleashed&quot;, was released. In an interview about it, he claimed, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to tell my story unless it was honest... You have to go through three sets of lawyers: Simon &amp; Schuster lawyers, WWE lawyers, my lawyers. Everything now being the way it is, you can be sued for the simplest thing.&quot; There was controversy over the book&#x27;s mention of Chris Benoit, a wrestler who killed his wife and strangled his son in a murder-suicide, and about whom other details were removed from the book. Bautista said, &quot;I loved the guy. I despise what he did, but that doesn&#x27;t erase him from my life. I fought to keep him in there and am glad they did.&quot;

When asked about his ex-wife, Angie, Bautista says, &quot;[We] have really become close again, which we really haven&#x27;t been in years. I really learned a lot about her, and she learned a lot about me from reading the book. She actually saw things from a different perspective from reading the book. So that was definitely therapeutic.&quot; Bautista held a campaign to raise money for Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance in 2010 because of Angie&#x27;s ovarian cancer battle.

During the week of November 5, 2007, Bautista appeared on &quot;Family Feud&quot; with several other WWE wrestlers.

On September 7, 2008, he was a judge on an episode of &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, with snails as the theme ingredient. Along with Candice Michelle, Shelton Benjamin, and Josh Mathews, he represented the WWE at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in an effort to persuade fans to register to vote in the 2008 presidential election. He has also appeared on &quot;MTV Cribs&quot; showing his house and cars. His first biographical DVD, &quot;Batista: I Walk Alone&quot;, was released through WWE Productions on October 20, 2009. A second DVD, &quot;WWE Batista: The Animal Unleashed&quot; (released June 2014) continued his life story, detailing his departure from WWE in 2010 and his return to it in 2014.

== Personal life ==

Bautista married his first wife, Glenda, in 1990. They had two daughters together, Keilani (b. 1990) and Athena (b. 1992), before they divorced in 1998. Bautista married his second wife, Angie, on October 13, 1998. They have a son together, Oliver, and divorced in 2006. Before the age of 40, Bautista already had two grandsons through Keilani. In October 2015, he married competitive pole dancer Sarah Jade. They separated in early 2019.

Bautista is tall and weighed around as of August 2020, later slimming down to around by September 2024. He has numerous tattoos, including a large dragon on his back, red kanji lettering on his upper left biceps which says &quot;Angel&quot; (in tribute to Angie), a signature design on his upper right biceps, and a small sun on his abdomen which encircles his navel. He also has a tattoo on his arm of the flags of Greece and the Philippines. While taking time off due to injury in 2009, he had both upper arms covered in large, tribal style tattoos, and the phrase &quot;DC soldier&quot; added to his right biceps. He once had a tattoo of a meteor on his arm, a logo associated with former friend Manny Pacquiao, but had it covered up with a sugar skull design after Pacquiao made homophobic remarks. Beginning in 2010, Bautista began eating a mostly plant-based, pescetarian diet, and plans to go completely vegan in the near future.

A baseball fan, Bautista grew up following the New York Yankees, although he has since embraced the Washington Nationals, who play at Nationals Park blocks from Bautista&#x27;s childhood home.

Bautista supported Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election and appeared in an ad for his presidential campaign. In 2024, Bautista, who supported U.S. vice president and presidential candidate Kamala Harris, filmed a video demeaning her opponent, Donald Trump, for &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;

<doc id="652410" wikidata="Q459930" url="?curid=652410" title="Lance Cade">
<text>Lance Kurtis McNaught (March 2, 1981 – August 13, 2010) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) where he performed under the ring names Garrison Cade and Lance Cade.

After being trained by Shawn Michaels, Cade made his debut in 1999 and worked in Japan before being signed to a developmental contract by WWE. He was assigned to Memphis Championship Wrestling, and later Heartland Wrestling Association, before ending up in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in 2003. In OVW, he formed a tag team with Mark Jindrak, and they were promoted to the &quot;Raw&quot; brand in June 2003. In 2004, the team split up, and Cade took time off after a knee injury, before returning to &quot;Raw&quot; with new tag partner Trevor Murdoch. The pair teamed together for almost three years before they broke up in May 2008. Cade then entered a storyline with Chris Jericho and Michaels, however, he was released in October 2008.

Cade was a three-time World Tag Team Champion with Murdoch in WWE and has also held the HWA Heavyweight Championship and HWA Tag Team Championship with both Steve Bradley and Mike Sanders. He was a one-time TWA Television Champion in the Texas Wrestling Alliance.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1999–2001)===
Cade started his wrestling career by becoming a student of Shawn Michaels at the Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy in San Antonio, Texas in 1999.

Cade and fellow wrestler Bryan Danielson went to Japan on December 1, 1999. They competed in Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW). Cade and Danielson worked as a tag team for a while before they went their separate ways; Cade stayed in FMW and faced off against Extreme Championship Wrestling wrestler Balls Mahoney in tag team matches and a three-way dance against another FMW wrestler. Cade left FMW after he was defeated by Mahoney in a three-way dance on February 25, 2000, also involving Crazy Boy.

===World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2001–2008)===

====Heartland Wrestling Association (2001–2002)====
After Cade signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), he was sent to Memphis Championship Wrestling in 2001. During the summer of that same year, he was moved to Les Thatcher&#x27;s Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). Cade quickly formed a tag-team with Surfer Cody Hawk, but the team split after only a few months when Cade joined the World Championship Wrestling camp in HWA&#x27;s Invasion angle. Cade aligned with Mike Sanders, a former WCW wrestler. The downfall of the team came on February 13, 2002, when Lance Cade and Mike Sanders defeated Val Venis and Steve Bradley to win the HWA Tag-Team titles. Cade and Sanders broke up that very day, and the titles were vacated. The next week, Cade faced Sanders and defeated him in a singles match, giving Cade the belts. Cade then chose Steve Bradley to be his new partner. However, Cade and Bradley had problems defeating WWF competition, as Hugh Morrus and Raven defeated on March 12, 2002, for the titles. Cade and Bradley, however, won the HWA Tag Titles three days later.

In April 2002, Cade&#x27;s first HWA tag-team partner returned, as Cody Hawk and the Ice Cream Man defeated Cade and Bradley for the tag-team titles. Cade and Bradley tried for the next month to get the titles back, even winning a tag team championship contendership match to get another shot, but never managed to get the titles back. On May 19, 2002, Cade defeated Johnny the Bull to become the HWA Heavyweight Champion. Cade defended the title for 2 months before Johnny the Bull won the title back on July 20. On the same night, however, Cade defeated Johnny in a second match, becoming the 2-time Heavyweight Champion. This reign lasted only one day, as Cade, lost his title to Cody Hawk.

====Ohio Valley Wrestling (2003–2004)====
During the summer of 2002, the HWA was dropped as a developmental territory by the renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), but Cade was transferred over to WWE&#x27;s main developmental company, Ohio Valley Wrestling when he signed a developmental contract in 2003. Cade continued to search for a strong tag-team partner to work with. He found René Duprée and both joined Kenny Bolin&#x27;s Bolin Services. The two worked as a tag-team throughout most of their stay in OVW.

In the OVW Tag Team Championship Tournament contested in February/March 2003, Cade and Duprée defeated Matt Morgan and BJ Payne, but could not beat the Disciples of Synn in the finals. Cade and Duprée had another shot at Spring Break-Out 2003, but the current champions at the time were WWE regulars The APA, and Cade and Duprée could not overcome the odds. Mark Jindrak later joined Bolin Services. Duprée appeared in WWE only a few weeks after their title shot. Cade continued tagging with Mark Jindrak, but was promoted to the Raw brand in June 2003 under the name, Garrison Cade.

====Teaming with Mark Jindrak; return to Ohio Valley Wrestling (2003–2005)====

Cade debuted on an episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; against Lance Storm on June 1, who forced him to submit to the Sharpshooter. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, he faced Storm in a re-match. Stone Cold Steve Austin came out interrupted, chanting the word &quot;Boring&quot;, and Storm became distracted, allowing Cade to sneak in and get the victory. Soon afterwards, Cade again found a tag-team partner in Mark Jindrak and began to challenge for the World Tag Team Championship. The belts were being held by former Cade ally René Duprée and his new partner Sylvain Grenier, a unit collectively known as La Résistance.

Over the next few months, Cade and Jindrak fought against many different teams, from La Resistance and the face gimmicks of the Dudley Boyz to battles against the top heels on &quot;Raw&quot;, Evolution. The duo also formed a semi-partnership with then babyface, Maven, helping each other out on occasion. Cade and Jindrak soon began to be known more for their cheating ways, however, rather than their abilities. This led them to turn heel and be entered into the Tag-Team Turmoil Match at Armageddon for the World Tag Team Championship. They came in from the crowd when their turn hit and quickly rolled up The Hurricane to eliminate him and Rosey. Cade and Jindrak next faced a face gimmick of Lance Storm and Val Venis, and Cade tripped up Venis from the outside on a suplex attempt, then held onto Venis&#x27; legs while Jindrak made the pinfall. The next team to come down were the Dudley Boyz, who eventually took out Jindrak with the 3-D to eliminate the boys. The duo got some revenge, though, attacking the Dudley Boyz after the match before leaving, making it harder for the Dudley Boyz to come out victorious (which they did not, losing at the end to then heels, Ric Flair and Batista).

Going into 2004, Cade and Jindrak continued to work together as a team, firmly entrenched in the mid-card ranks. The team got a win in March 2004, when they defeated The Hurricane and Rosey to earn a shot at the World Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania XX. Cade and Jindrak entered a four-way tag match against the champions, then babyface, Booker T and Rob Van Dam, and the other two competing teams, La Résistance and the Dudley Boyz. Cade and Jindrak lost the match, though, after Rob Van Dam pinned Rob Conway.

After Jindrak was drafted to the SmackDown! brand, Cade briefly associated himself with Jonathan Coachman, helping Coachman get a win over Tajiri at Backlash. Cade later teamed up with Coachman at Vengeance to take on the debuting team of Rhyno and Tajiri. Cade and Coachman lost the match, and Cade was taken off WWE television after an injury in July 2004. While off WWE television for quite some time, Cade returned to OVW in 2005 under his former ring name Lance Cade in order begin a return to the main roster. Cade sided with The Blueprint Matt Morgan and Vengeance against the OVW Heavyweight Champion Elijah Burke. In February 2005, Cade took on Burke in a $5,000 Bounty Match, but was defeated.

Cade faded into the background for the next few weeks, eventually making his return to the ring at the June 3 OVW Summer Sizzler Series 2005 show, taking on Al Snow. While Cade brought his cowboy hat with him, Snow brought Head, routinely turning to the mannequin head for guidance. During the match, when Cade was knocked to the outside, Snow destroyed Cade&#x27;s hat, stomping on it. This made the match more personal to Cade, but in the end, Snow knocked out Cade with Head, getting the victory. Later that night, Cade interfered in the Brent Albright/Elijah Burke OVW Heavyweight Title match, with Cade attacking the champion, Albright. The two foes had a No Disqualification, Loser Must Tap Out Match at the OVW Summer Sizzler Series 2005 show on June 17, 2005. Cade tried to pin Albright early in the match. The ref did not allow it, causing a shoving match between the two. Later in the match, Albright got his Crowbar submission on Cade, but Cade escaped, then appeared to be leaving, with Albright chasing him down. Albright got the Crowbar applied on Cade again, right on the ramp. With nowhere to go, Cade was forced to tap, losing to Albright.

==== Teaming with Trevor Murdoch (2005–2008) ====
On August 22, 2005, a promo was shown on &quot;Raw&quot; showcasing a long-haired Cade, who was soon to be returning with tag team partner Trevor Murdoch. The promo showed Cade and Murdoch portraying rednecks, with Cade (who retained his real first name) playing the role of a smooth-talking cowboy while Murdoch was depicted as an angry Southern trucker.

Cade and Murdoch debuted as a team on &quot;Raw&quot; on September 5, 2005. They defeated the World Tag Team Champions, the Hurricane and Rosey in a non-title match. This earned them a World Tag Team title shot at Unforgiven. During the title match, Murdoch delivered an elevated DDT on The Hurricane to the outside. The DDT caused Hurricane to suffer a kayfabe stinger. It also allowed Cade and Murdoch to defeat Hurricane and Rosey for the World Tag Team championships. They defended against random teams on &quot;Raw&quot; for the next month before losing the titles to Big Show and Kane at Taboo Tuesday. After losing in a rematch on the November 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cade and Murdoch began to be squashed by other tag teams, before wrestling singles matches.

On the November 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, it was announced that Cade and Murdoch had parted ways as a tag team. The next week, Cade debuted with the gimmick of a &quot;Refined Southern Gentleman,&quot; wearing new tights with rhinestones on them as well as his new jacket he wore to the ring. Cade was relegated to Heat, making very few appearances on Raw at the end of 2005. He had a chance to get into the 2006 Royal Rumble, competing with Rob Conway and Gregory Helms against the Big Show in a Second Chance Battle Royal. However, The Big Show won the spot in the Rumble.

Eventually, the Cade and Murdoch tandem reformed as they were seen helping Chris Masters and Carlito attack Kane. On the edition of April 14 of &quot;Heat&quot;, it was announced that Cade and Murdoch were reuniting as a tag team after Murdoch helped Cade defeat Goldust. Cade also debuted another slight change with wet hair and shorter tights with a design similar to when he was teaming with Murdoch. On the edition of May 19 of &quot;Heat&quot; Cade and Murdoch officially reformed their tag team by facing and defeating Charlie Haas and Viscera.

Cade and Murdoch next entered a short-lived feud against D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels). It started when Cade and Murdoch ambushed Shawn Michaels and Triple H, before Triple H&#x27;s match with Vince McMahon on the September 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Cade and Murdoch continued to battle DX, until they were defeated in a street fight, ending the feud on the October 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.
After biding much of their time on &quot;Raw&#x27;s&quot; sister show &quot;Heat&quot;, Cade and Murdoch began a feud in April with World Tag Team Champions The Hardys, leading to their title match at Backlash, which The Hardys won. In the storyline, Cade and Murdoch suddenly gained a great deal of respect for The Hardys and began to praise their abilities. The Hardys then began an alliance with Cade and Murdoch. Despite the alliance, Cade and Murdoch faced The Hardys in a rematch at Judgment Day which The Hardys won. On the edition of June 4 of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cade and Murdoch were given another shot at the World Tag Team Championship against The Hardys and were successful, becoming two time World Tag Team Champions. When Cade made the pin on Jeff Hardy, Hardy&#x27;s foot was on the ropes but was pushed off by Murdoch. After the match, when Matt Hardy argued with Cade and Murdoch, they attacked Matt and Jeff with the tag belts, becoming heels again. At , Cade and Murdoch defeated the Hardys to retain the gold after Cade pinned Jeff. Cade along with Murdoch lost the titles at a house show on September 5 to Paul London and Brian Kendrick on a South Africa tour. Later on, in that same tour, Cade and Murdoch won the titles back. After 93 days, their third reign came to an end on December 10 at the Raw XV anniversary, when they lost the championship to the team of Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes. On December 28, Cade separated his shoulder at a house show in Atlanta, and was inactive for the next month. Cade made his return, teaming with Murdoch, on the February 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, in a losing effort to Holly and Rhodes.

Late in April 2008, Murdoch began to develop a country singing gimmick. On the May 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cade turned on Murdoch following a &quot;victory song,&quot; punching Murdoch in the face twice, ending the partnership. The two faced off on the edition of June 2, 2008 of &quot;Raw&quot;, with Cade getting the victory to end their feud.

==== Alliance with Chris Jericho; departure (2008) ====
Cade formed an alliance with Chris Jericho on the June 16 airing of &quot;Raw&quot; when he assisted Jericho in laying out John Cena and Triple H. In the following weeks, Cade began accompanying Jericho to the ring for his matches, becoming a protégé of sorts and aiding him in his feud with Shawn Michaels. Cade claimed that, being a former protégé of Michaels, he was not going to wait for him to turn on him like Michaels did several past partners.

At a Raw house show in early August, Cade suffered a broken nose in a match against Paul London, who was also busted open as a result of a botched move. Cade returned to in-ring action on &quot;Raw&quot; on September 22 in a handicap match with Jericho and John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield, defeating Michaels and Batista, with Cade pinning his former mentor. Michaels would then defeat Cade one-on-one in a no disqualification match on the October 6 episode, in what was Cade&#x27;s last appearance. On October 14, 2008, Cade was released from his WWE contract. Jim Ross later stated that &quot;he made a major league mistake while utilizing bad judgment&quot; and that it was instrumental to his departure. Ross referenced Cade having a seizure on a plane and needing emergency medical care as a part of this:

===Independent circuit (2008–2010)===

Less than a week after Cade&#x27;s release, he began accepting bookings with Trevor Murdoch as a team on the independent circuit, including Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South as well as NWA Showcase.

Cade returned to Japan in December 2008 teaming with his former tag team partner René Duprée for Hustle on December 24 and 25. They appeared as masked wrestlers, Dyna and Might Sharpe, a parody of the Sharpe Brothers. The team defeated Tenyru and Koshinaka both nights. Five nights later they had their third and final match with Tenyru and Koshinaka and HUSTLEMANIA in a losing effort. Cade returned as &quot;Cowboy&quot; Cade, his former WWE character, on February 19 at Korakuen Hall to defeat the tag team of Tajiri and Akebono when Cade pinned Tajiri. On February 22, Cade defeated Akebono in a singles match in the main event of Hustle&#x27;s debut show in Chiba, Japan.

Cade was scheduled to face NWA North American Heavyweight Champion Apollo in an &quot;NWA On Fire&quot; event on August 22, 2009, but was unable to attend due to a family emergency. He wrestled Trevor Murdoch at a World Stars of Wrestling event in September 2009.

In September 2009, Cade was re-signed by WWE, appearing in its developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling, but was released in April 2010 without returning to the main roster.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (2010) ===

In May 2010, Cade began wrestling for All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he joined the Voodoo Murders stable. He participated in AJPW&#x27;s &quot;Rise Up&quot; and &quot;Cross Over&quot; tours. He primarily wrestled alongside his stablemates such as René Duprée, Hate, Minoru, and TARU in tag team matches and six-man tag team matches. He wrestled what became the final match of his career on July 4, 2010, defeating Seiya Sanada. At the time of his death, he had been scheduled to challenge for the World Tag Team Championship alongside 
René Duprée.

==Personal life==
McNaught married Tanya Gonzalez on June 14, 2000, but they divorced on May 16, 2006. In September 2008, he and Tanya remarried in Las Vegas, NV, and they remained married until his death in 2010.

<text>&#x27; (H-day), today usually called &quot;&#x27;&quot; (), was on 3 September 1967, the day on which Sweden switched from driving on the left-hand side of the road to the right. The &quot;H&quot; stands for &quot;Högertrafik&quot;, the Swedish word for right-hand traffic. It was by far the largest logistical event in Sweden&#x27;s history.

==Background==
There were various arguments for the change:
*All neighbouring countries drove on the right, including Norway and Finland, with which Sweden shares land borders, with 5 million vehicles crossing annually.
*More than 90 percent of Swedes drove left-hand-drive vehicles, and this led to many head-on collisions when passing on narrow two-lane highways. City buses were among the very few vehicles that conformed to the normal opposite-steering wheel rule, being right-hand-drive (RHD).

However, the change was unpopular; in a 1955 referendum, 83 percent voted to keep driving on the left. Nevertheless, the Riksdag approved Prime Minister Tage Erlander&#x27;s proposal on 10 May 1963 of right-hand traffic beginning in 1967, as the number of cars on the road tripled from 500,000 to 1.5 million and was expected to reach 2.8 million by 1975. The Swedish Commission for the Introduction of Right-Hand Driving (&quot;Statens högertrafikkommission&quot;, HTK) was established to oversee the change. It also began implementing a four-year education programme on the advice of psychologists.

The public information campaign leading up to Dagen H included extensive advertising, road markings, and even distribution of reminder items like gloves and stickers to ensure everyone was aware of the change.

The campaign included displaying the &quot;Dagen H&quot; logo on various commemorative items, including milk cartons and underwear. Swedish television held a contest for songs about the change, and the winning entry was &quot;Håll dig till höger, Svensson&quot; (&#x27;Keep to the right, Svensson&#x27;) written by &quot;Expressen&quot; journalist Peter Himmelstrand and performed by The Telstars.

As &quot;Dagen H&quot; neared, every intersection was equipped with an extra set of poles and traffic signals wrapped in black plastic. Workers roamed the streets early in the morning on &quot;Dagen H&quot; to remove the plastic. A parallel set of lines was painted on the roads with white paint, then covered with black tape. Before &quot;Dagen H&quot;, Swedish roads had used yellow lines. Approximately 350,000 signs had to be removed or replaced, including some 20,000 in Stockholm alone.

Vehicles had to have their original left-hand-traffic headlamps replaced with right-traffic units. One of the reasons the Riksdag pushed ahead with Dagen H despite public unpopularity was that most vehicles in Sweden at the time used inexpensive, standard-size round headlamps, but the trend towards more expensive model-specific headlamps had begun in continental Europe and was expected to spread through most other parts of the world. Further delay in changing over from left- to right-hand traffic would have greatly increased the cost burden to vehicle owners.

==The switch==
On &quot;Dagen H&quot;, Sunday, 3 September 1967, all non-essential traffic was banned from the roads from 01:00 to 06:00. Any vehicles on the roads during that time had to come to a complete stop at 04:50, then carefully change to the right-hand side of the road and stop again (to give others time to switch sides of the road and avoid a head-on collision) before being allowed to proceed at 05:00. In Stockholm and Malmö, however, the ban was longerfrom 10:00 on Saturday until 15:00 on Sundayto allow work crews to reconfigure intersections. Certain other towns also saw an extended ban, from 15:00 on Saturday until 15:00 on Sunday.

One-way streets presented unique problems. Bus stops had to be constructed on the other side of the street. Intersections had to be reshaped to allow traffic to merge.

== Results ==
The relatively smooth changeover saw a temporary reduction in the number of accidents. On the day of the change, only 157 minor accidents were reported, of which only 32 involved personal injuries, with only a low number being serious. On the Monday following &quot;Dagen H&quot;, there were 125 reported traffic accidents, compared to a range of 130 to 198 for previous Mondays, none of them fatal. Experts suggested that changing to driving on the right reduced accidents while overtaking, as people already drove left-hand drive vehicles, thereby having a better view of the road ahead; additionally, the change caused a marked surge in perceived risk that exceeded the actual level, and thus was followed by very cautious behaviour that caused a major decrease in road fatalities. Indeed, fatal car-to-car and car-to-pedestrian accidents dropped sharply as a result, and the number of motor insurance claims went down by 40%.

These initial improvements did not last, however. The number of motor insurance claims returned to &quot;normal&quot; over the next six weeks and, by 1969, the accident rates were back to the levels seen before the change.

Trams in central Stockholm, in Helsingborg and most lines in Malmö (which ultimately abolished its tram system in 1973) were withdrawn and replaced by buses, and more than 1,000 new buses were purchased with doors on the right-hand side. Some 8,000 older buses were retrofitted to provide doors on both sides, while Gothenburg and Malmö exported their left-traffic buses to Pakistan and Kenya. 

Although all road traffic in Sweden changed to the right-hand side, railways and the metro system in Stockholm did not switch to the new rule and continued to drive on the left, with the exception of tram systems. Additionally, many of them were abandoned as a result of &quot;Dagen H&quot;; only the trams in Norrköping and Gothenburg and three suburban lines in the Stockholm area (Nockebybanan and Lidingöbanan) survived. Gothenburg faced high costs for reconfiguring trams, while Stockholm&#x27;s budget only covered purchasing new buses, since the remaining lines had bidirectional trams with doors on both sides. In any event, most trams in Stockholm were replaced by the metro, a decision made long before the Dagen H decision.

Fellow Nordic country Iceland changed to driving on the right on 26 May 1968, on a day known as H-dagurinn.

<text>Big and Little Wong Tin Bar (), also known as Seven Little Valiant Fighters () and Two of a Kind, is a 1962 Hong Kong film. It is notable for being Jackie Chan&#x27;s and Sammo Hung&#x27;s film debut. Until 2016, the film was considered lost. The only footage that survived before that period were a 9-minute opening clip and a short 5-minute clip of dialogue. The film was rediscovered when a complete copy was released onto YouTube on 3 February 2016.

==Plot==
Old hero Wong Samtai, is hosting a banquet for warriors from the four seas. The invitation is received also by the head of the Black Wind fortress Kam Ching, who wants to marry his daughter Lotus to his son Wong Tinbar. But Tinbar does not want this wedding and sees his future with Cheung Kwailan. The afflicted Ching and his daughter steal the jade seal, which belongs to the King of Magical Power. Tinbar is accused of theft. He fails to find a seal and his father is imprisoned. Cheung Kwailan is trapped in the Black Wind Fortress during an overnight search along with Tinbar, but the sudden appearance of the Seven Little Rookies saves her from captivity. Thanks to this, her searches continue and lead to the Dragon Cave with a poisonous python, where the seal is located. Nevertheless, Tinbar is under arrest by the lord. Kwailan and the Seven Rascals force the culprits to surrender - this is part of the Tinbar rescue mission at the lord&#x27;s residence to settle this problem once and for all.

==Cast==
NOTE: Many actors who were featured in this film do not have the same names as they do today, this was due to them taking their master&#x27;s name which is part of Chinese tradition while studying martial arts.

==Chronology of events==
Until 2009, the film was considered lost. After many decades in which this film was considered lost it was found in the Hong Kong Film Archive (HKFA). To this day the film has only screened twice – on 14 and 22 November 2009 – at the Cinema of the HKFA.

A few days after the two screenings, in December 2009, two short clips (a 9-minute opening clip and a short 5-minute clip of dialogue) were uploaded to YouTube. On 3 February 2016 the full movie was uploaded to YouTube.

Until the screenings at the Cinema of the HKFA and the upload in 2016, there were 3 known scenes involving Jackie Chan and some kids only. He fights someone older and then sings. Some footage of this film is shown in &quot;Jackie Chan: My Story&quot;.

==Filming Information==
Big and Little Wong Tin Bar was filmed in Hong Kong in the Cantonese language using Black-and-white 35 mm film with a Mono audio track.

<doc id="652414" wikidata="Q3327040" url="?curid=652414" title="Sabre Wulf">
<text>Sabre Wulf is an action-adventure game released by British video game developer Ultimate Play the Game for the ZX Spectrum home computer in 1984. The player navigates the pith-helmeted Sabreman through a 2D jungle maze while collecting amulet pieces to bypass the guardian at its exit. The player does not receive explicit guidance on how to play and is left to decipher the game&#x27;s objectives through trial and error. Sabreman moves between the maze&#x27;s 256 connected screens by touching the border where one screen ends and another begins. Each screen is filled with colourful flora, enemies that spawn at random, and occasional collectibles.

Ultimate released the game for the ZX Spectrum at an above-average price to combat piracy. Its premium product packaging became a company standard. The developers had finished &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; sequels in advance of its release but—in keeping with their penchant for secrecy—chose to withhold them for marketing purposes. The sequels were swiftly released later that year. Ultimate hired outside developers to port &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; to other computing platforms: the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC. The game was later featured in compilations including the 2015 retrospective of games by Ultimate and its successor, Rare.

Several gaming publications recommended the game, and &quot;Crash&quot; magazine readers named it the &quot;Best Maze Game&quot; of 1984. &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; was a bestseller and a financial success. Though its labyrinthine gameplay was similar to that of Ultimate&#x27;s previous release, reviewers preferred &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;. They further noted its difficult gameplay and lauded its graphics. Game journalists remember &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; among the Spectrum&#x27;s best releases, and for starting the Sabreman series.

== Gameplay ==
In &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, the player guides the pith-helmeted adventurer Sabreman through a two-dimensional maze. The player must reconstruct an amulet from its four pieces scattered throughout the maze to bypass the guardian at its exit, a cave that leads to the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Underwurlde&quot;. The maze is presented in flip-screens such that the player views one static tile of the maze&#x27;s grid at a time. For example, when Sabreman reaches the left edge of one screen, he continues the maze at the right edge of the next screen.

The game opens to music composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. Its tiled maze contains 256 screens and is drawn in a 16 by 16 grid. The maze&#x27;s paths are bordered by tropical flora, populated with attacking enemies and, on its outskirts, surrounded by mountains. Apart from the jungle, the game&#x27;s maze also includes several lakes. The player swings Sabreman&#x27;s sabre with the push of the joystick&#x27;s fire button to defeat enemies that spawn in random on-screen locations. When the player idles too long in the same screen, an indestructible bushfire appears to pursue Sabreman. Enemies include spiders, scorpions, snakes, bats, indigenous people, sleeping hippos, and a fast wolf (the titular Sabre Wulf). Some enemies are killed, others flee when hit, while the wolf, cave guardian, and bushfire are unaffected by the sabre.

The player does not receive any explicit guidance on how to play and is left to decipher the game&#x27;s objectives through trial and error. &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; graphics fill the screen with a minimal user interface consisting of the current game score, number of lives left and a high score meter on the top row. Sabreman can eat orchid power-ups, which bloom for only a few seconds, to turn the colour of the orchid and receive a temporary character effect. Some effects empower (e.g. invulnerability, increased speed) while others impair (e.g. reversing the player&#x27;s controls). Sabreman can also collect treasure and extra lives scattered throughout the maze. The Spectrum and Commodore 64 releases include a two-player mode in which players take turns controlling their own Sabreman.

== Development ==
The developer of &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, Ultimate Play the Game, had a reputation for secrecy. The company rarely gave interviews or revealed details about their internal practices or upcoming games. Little is known about their development process apart from using Sage IV computers, preferring to develop for the ZX Spectrum&#x27;s Z80 microprocessor, and often outsourcing development for other platforms, such as those that ran 6502 microprocessors. After releasing &quot;Atic Atac&quot; at the end of 1983, Ultimate went silent until it ran teaser advertisements for &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; in April 1984. The company rarely depicted actual gameplay in their advertisements. They had already prepared &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, the third game in the Sabreman series, in advance of the character&#x27;s introduction in &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;. Ultimate withheld &quot;Knight Lore&quot; for about a year because they felt &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; would not have sold as well once players saw the former&#x27;s graphical advancements. &quot;Knight Lore&quot; subsequently became known as a seminal work in British gaming history and an iconic game of the 1980s for its popularization of the isometric platformer format.

Ultimate released &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; for the ZX Spectrum in 1984 and the other Sabreman titles that were released later that year. &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; was Ultimate&#x27;s first game to use what would become the company&#x27;s standard price and mysterious, unadorned packaging. Retailing at £9.95, Ultimate nearly doubled its usual price in what they saw as a &quot;bold step&quot; to combat piracy. They expected legal owners to be more protective over letting friends copy their more expensive games. Ultimate had seen competitor prices slowly increasing and felt that the price was fair for their time invested. The game retailed in a large, high-quality cardboard box with a glossy instruction manual, both upgrades over typical game packaging. It became Ultimate&#x27;s standard packaging for new games. The company&#x27;s game packaging was nondescript and showed no screenshots of the in-game world. Ultimate&#x27;s games also did not display internal credits. The company hired outside developers to complete &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; ports for other computers. Paul Proctor wrote the BBC Micro conversion, and in 1985, Greg Duddle wrote the Commodore 64 conversion, which was licensed under Firebird. &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; later appeared in the 1985 compilation &quot;They Sold a Million&quot;, a collection of Spectrum games that had together sold a million units. When the compilation was released for the Amstrad CPC, &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; was converted for the platform and eventually released in a standalone edition. &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; also appeared alongside &quot;Underwurlde&quot;, its sequel, in a Commodore 64 pack, and in the August 2015 Xbox One compilation of 30 Ultimate and Rare titles, &quot;Rare Replay&quot;.

== Reception ==
Reviewers appreciated the game&#x27;s graphics and found its gameplay similar to Ultimate&#x27;s previous game, &quot;Atic Atac&quot;—particularly in its opening sequence and maze format—but preferred &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;. Critics also noted the game&#x27;s difficulty and above-average pricing. &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; received a &quot;Crash Smash&quot; award in July 1984, and was also a selected recommendation in &quot;Personal Computer Games&quot; (August 1984), and &quot;Popular Computing Weekly&quot; (June 1984). The game was named &quot;Best Maze Game&quot; in the 1984 &quot;Crash&quot; Readers Awards. Ultimate&#x27;s new pricing strategy was a success and &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; topped the sales chart in the video game format. While &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; reported that &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; broke the company&#x27;s sales records, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; (&quot;CVG&quot;) said that the release underperformed prior games, with only 30,000 copies sold by December 1984. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; later reported that 350,000 units were sold in total.

&quot;Crash&quot; confirmed rumours that the game was similar to &quot;Atic Atac&quot;, but declared &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; the better and predicted that they would have similar legacies. The magazine wrote that their inability to intuit Sabreman&#x27;s current inventory or resistance to damage added to the game&#x27;s mystique, and that Ultimate was particularly skilled at not giving hints but leaving sufficient clues through the game&#x27;s design. &quot;Personal Computer Games&quot; found one such tip: that the indigenous enemies make a sound when aligned with an amulet piece. In a similar experience, &quot;Popular Computing Weekly&quot; slowly learned to use rather than avoid the orchids. &quot;CVG&quot; described the game&#x27;s instructions as &quot;cryptic&quot;. &quot;Crash&quot; later reflected that comparisons to &quot;Atic Atac&quot; at its launch were unfair, similar to calling any two text adventures identical.

Critics had high praise for the colourful and detailed graphics and animations. In the opinion of &quot;CVG&quot; reviewers, &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; carried Ultimate&#x27;s momentum from &quot;Jetpac&quot; and &quot;Atic Atac&quot;, and had the best graphics of any ZX Spectrum game, with graphical detail that surpassed what previous reviewers had considered the computer&#x27;s limits. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; particularly liked how the hippo enemies force the player to vary their hack-and-slash gameplay style. A &quot;Crash&quot; reviewer called the game &quot;a Software Masterpiece&quot;. The magazine received more mail in praise of &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; in 1984 than for any other game and, a year later, repeated that &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; was among the top games available for the Spectrum, adding that the game did not feel antiquated. &quot;CVG&quot; Commodore 64 review, two years after the original release, approved of the port and said that the game remained a classic.

Reviewers complained of the game&#x27;s high price, which was nearly double the average. &quot;Crash&quot; wondered if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. &quot;CVG&quot; recommended drawing a map of the maze, without which it was easy to get lost. While &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; had some flicker issues, said &quot;Sinclair User&quot;, the game altogether met Ultimate&#x27;s high quality benchmarks.

A retrospective review from &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; reduced &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; to &quot;an interactive maze&quot; packed with colour and hack-and-slash gameplay. The magazine likened the game&#x27;s colour choice and setting to what the magazine considered Ultimate&#x27;s best arcade game, &quot;Dingo&quot; (1983), and lamented Sabreman&#x27;s inability to hit enemies above or below him. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; Peter Parrish retrospectively found the game&#x27;s collision detection imprecise as well. In &quot;The Routledge Companion to Video Game Studies&quot;, Simon Niedenthal used &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; as an example of games that maximised the limited colour palette of 8-bit computers. He described its colours as &quot;glow(ing) like stained glass, and the effects of color purity are enhanced by contrast with the black background&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Players and game journalists consider the game among the Spectrum&#x27;s best. &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; was the first of four titles in the Sabreman series for the ZX Spectrum. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; credited the character&#x27;s name and character traits for its lasting memorability. As an ordinary human with a hat and exaggerated nose, Sabreman fit the video game 8-bit era&#x27;s character archetype. The last, unreleased game in the Spectrum Sabreman series, &quot;Mire Mare&quot;, was planned to have been similar to &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; in gameplay. Rare, the successor to Ultimate, later released a side-scrolling platformer in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance handheld console—also titled &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;—in which Sabreman enlists jungle animals to solve the Sabre Wulf&#x27;s puzzles. It was not received well by fans. Elements from the original &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; appear in other games, including Rare&#x27;s &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; and &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, which features a character named Sabrewulf. &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; had at one point in development a main character called Sabre the wolf. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; considered Sabreman&#x27;s recurring appearance to be proof of Rare&#x27;s interest in the character and series.

<doc id="652418" wikidata="Q1314177" url="?curid=652418" title="Mr. Nice Guy (1997 film)">
<text>Mr. Nice Guy (一個好人, LSHK &quot;Jat1 go3 hou2 jan4&quot;) is a 1997 English-language Hong Kong action comedy film directed by Sammo Hung, who also cameo appearance as an unfortunate cyclist. The film stars Jackie Chan and Richard Norton. The film was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 31 January 1997.

&quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot; features a collaboration between Chan and Norton, reuniting them for the first time since 1993&#x27;s &quot;City Hunter&quot;. Set in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, it is Chan&#x27;s first film to be scripted and shot in English.

==Plot==
Mob boss Giancarlo discovers that his lover Tina is actually a mole for the Demons street gang, so he buries her alive at a mining site.

Television journalist Diana records footage of a cocaine deal gone wrong between the Italian mob and a street gang called The Demons. During the deal, mob boss Giancarlo kills the Demons&#x27; leader Grank and a gun fight ensues. Giancarlo spots Diana and her partner Richard and orders his gang to chase them. Richard is captured while Diana flees from the mobsters, bumping into TV chef Jackie, who helps her escape. During the chase, she accidentally switches the videotape of the drug trade with one of Jackie&#x27;s cooking videos. Jackie brings the tape to his adoptive brother Romeo, a police officer. Romeo&#x27;s children watch the video, unaware of what it is and that their father is investigating the mob. The mob force Richard to give them Diana&#x27;s address. They ambush Diana at her house and kidnap her when they realize the tapes were switched and Jackie has the tape they want. Diana escapes after creating a distraction in front of a crowd.

The mob believes Jackie has the tape and follows him around, while some Demons follow them, hoping for a chance to kill some of the mobsters in retaliation for killing Grank. Jackie is forced to fend them off and run when they attack him at a benefit event he is hosting at the mall. Puzzled at the mobsters&#x27; actions, one of the Demons asks a mobster why they are chasing Jackie. Jackie learns why the mob is chasing him after Diana sneaks into his house searching for the tape. She is attacked by Jackie&#x27;s friend Lakeisha, who thinks her an intruder, but Jackie intervenes. Diana begs for the tape, but Jackie is convinced that he does not have it. Before Diana can leave Jackie&#x27;s apartment building, Giancarlo&#x27;s henchmen show up, unaware that Demon members have been following them.

Jackie and the women escape from the roof just as the Demons throw grenades in Jackie&#x27;s apartment, killing the mobsters and blowing up Jackie&#x27;s apartment. The Demons realize afterwards that was Jackie&#x27;s apartment, and how serious Giancarlo is about retrieving the videotape. They decide to exploit the situation in order to extort money from Giancarlo. They call Giancarlo to set up a meeting to trade the tape and the mob&#x27;s stolen cocaine for a large sum of money. Everyone decides to stay at Lakeisha&#x27;s home for safety, but the Demons soon find them. They kidnap Jackie&#x27;s girlfriend Miki (Miki Lee) and give Jackie a cell phone, demanding that he give them the videotape in 12 hours. Jackie turns to Romeo for the police&#x27;s help. The next day, Jackie goes to meet the Demons to trade in a decoy videotape, but no Demon meets Jackie in person. Instead, they frequently call him on his cell phone and make him go to various locations in the city.

The police trace each call, but discover the Demons are trying to thwart their presence, so they follow Jackie instead. However, the gang discovers this and they escape with Miki. Jackie, angry at the cops&#x27; mishandling, refuses to work with them anymore. However, he is kidnapped by the Demons moments later. Jackie fights off the gang and causes their van to crash. Before the police show up, Jackie forces one of the Demons to tell him where Miki is: at a construction site. Jackie insists to Diana and Lakeisha not to follow him to the construction site, but they go there anyway. While Jackie looks for Miki, Giancarlo and his men show up. A fight ensues between Jackie and the mobsters, which ends in Jackie getting captured. Lakeisha and Miki are also taken, while Diana is injured but escapes. Giancarlo murders the other Demons on site except for Sandy, who also escapes but with serious injuries.

Meanwhile, Romeo discovers his son watching Diana&#x27;s tape, the proof he needs to arrest the mob, and visits the hospital where Diana and Sandy are being treated. The women inform him about what happened to Jackie and the others. At Giancarlo&#x27;s home, Giancarlo demands the tape from Jackie one last time. Jackie decides to call Romeo, but he is not home. Afterwards Jackie is forced into an unfair fight with Giancarlo. After taking a beating, Giancarlo orders his men to kill Jackie and the women at &quot;the guesthouse&quot;, which is code for a mining site used by Giancarlo where he buries people alive. However, they escape and destroy Giancarlo&#x27;s home by driving through it in a 120-ton mining vehicle, which also causes cocaine to be spread outside in view of the police. The authorities arrive with Romeo, but they decide to state that they did not witness anything and that it was just another gang battle, so that Jackie can go free while the mobsters are arrested for possession of cocaine.

==Production==
In 1996, Jackie Chan commented on Sammo Hung&#x27;s unpopularity with film buyers: &quot;[...] no one wants to see him in movies anymore. It&#x27;s a very sad thing, so I called him up and we made a movie [Mr. Nice Guy] together again. So, right now Sammo can only direct; he cannot act.&quot;

The film was originally going to be the fifth film in Chan&#x27;s &quot;Police Story&quot; film series, with its setting in Sydney, Australia, but in a month&#x27;s time it was revised to become a stand-alone action film set in Melbourne. It is Chan&#x27;s first film to be scripted and shot in English.

According to his book &quot;I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action&quot;, Chan hurt his neck when he messed up on a flip during a fight scene. He also broke his nose during filming.

==New Line Cinema edit and DVD releases==
For US$6 million, New Line Cinema acquired from Golden Harvest the international distribution rights to the film outside of Asia. The film received a partial dub, a new score, and more than 13 minutes of cuts were made. Most of the cuts were bits of violence (violence against women in particular), and cuts for pacing. Many scenes were also rearranged. The most noticeable scene rearrangement are the opening scenes of Giancarlo killing Tina and Jackie&#x27;s cooking show. The original version opens with Giancarlo killing Tina, then Jackie&#x27;s cooking show, but New Line Cinema&#x27;s edit opens the other way around, giving the movie a &quot;lighter&quot; tone from the start.

There are also differences between the Hong Kong and the Japanese versions of the film. The only scene cut from the Hong Kong version is the entirety of a dinner scene featuring Jackie, Romeo, Baggio, Lakiesha, Sonny, and Nancy (Romeo&#x27;s children). The Japanese version contains this scene in its entirety, whereas the New Line Cinema edit contains most of this scene, but with a few cuts.

Various DVD versions of this film have been made. The Warner Brothers Japanese R2 version is the only version available with the original English dialog and the fully uncut version (the Japanese edit). However, the picture is non-anamorphic and has no English subtitles. The Taiwan Funny version has the New Line Cinema and Taiwanese versions, but the latter is dubbed in Mandarin. The HK version is similar to the Taiwanese, but dubbed in Cantonese. Both dubbed Asian versions refer to the Demons as the &quot;Wolves,&quot; although in the end credits the actors are credited as &quot;Demons.&quot;

In September 2019, Warner Archive Collection announced that it would release the film on Blu-ray, including the original uncut version newly remastered in HD sourced from a 4K scan of the original camera negative, in addition to the original New Line cut. The Blu-ray was released on 29 October 2019.

<doc id="652423" wikidata="Q225175" url="?curid=652423" title="Snake in the Eagle's Shadow">
<text>Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow () is a 1978 Hong Kong martial arts action comedy film directed by Yuen Woo-ping in his directorial debut. It stars Jackie Chan, Hwang Jang-lee, and Yuen Woo-ping&#x27;s real life father, Yuen Siu-tien. The film&#x27;s plot is about Chien Fu (Jackie Chan), an orphan who is bullied at a kung fu school, meeting an old beggar, Pai Cheng-tien (Yuen Siu-tien), who becomes his &quot;sifu&quot; (teacher) and trains him in Snake Kung Fu.

Right after this film, Yuen Woo-ping directed &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, released in the same year, which also starred Jackie Chan, Hwang Jang-lee and Yuen Siu-tien. The film established Chan&#x27;s slapstick kung fu comedy style which he further developed with &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, while also establishing the basic plot structure used in many martial arts films internationally since then.

==Plot==
Chien Fu, an orphan adopted by a kung fu school, is overworked as their janitor while being bullied and abused by the kung fu teachers as a walking punching-bag. The school&#x27;s cook, Ah-Wu, is his only sympathizer. Chien befriends an old beggar by offering him a meal and a place to stay. Unknown to Chien, the old beggar is actually Pai Cheng-tien, one of the last surviving masters of the Snake-style of kung fu. Pai is on the run from the Eagle Claw clan, which is viciously killing off all of the rival Snake-style masters. He is ambushed by Eagle Claw student Su Chen and an assassin masquerading as a Christian missionary (Roy Horan), and is injured. After being abused once more, Chien later finds Pai and helps him recover. Pai agrees to give him more lessons, on the condition that he does not call him &quot;sifu&quot; (&quot;master&quot;), since they are friends. The real reason, however, is to keep Chien&#x27;s connection with him secret from his pursuers.

Chien practices the lessons and learns to avoid being hurt by the school&#x27;s bumbling teachers. When the school is invaded by the Mantis school, to everyone&#x27;s amazement Chien easily defeats their master using the snake style. One of the passing wanderers who witnesses the fight is the high master of the Eagle Clan, Sheng Kuan, who recognizes the style at once and decides to tail Chien.

Chien meets Shang Kuan, who inquires about the old beggar, claiming that he was a colleague of Pai&#x27;s. As a show of &#x27;proof&#x27;, he easily fends off Chien&#x27;s attacks. Chien realises that his Snake-style fighting is no match for the style practiced by the stranger, and thus creates a new style from watching his pet cat kill a cobra.

Later on the Eagle Claw conspirators track down Pai, who manages to kill Su Chen. He returns to Chien for hiding, but it is then shown that Ah-Wu is also an Eagle Claw conspirator as he puts poison into their tea. Chien rushes to fetch Sheng Kuan, but sensing danger, Pai flees, with his enemy in pursuit. As Chien hurries after them, he finally learns the truth behind the conspiracy upon defeating the fake missionary, and eventually challenges Sheng Kuan to single combat after Pai is brought down. Apparently at a disadvantage in the initial phase, Chien brings his new &#x27;Cat Claw&#x27; technique—against which Sheng Kuan knows no defense—to bear, killing him. When Ah-Wu shows up after the fight and reveals his true allegiance, Chien and Pai feign defeat, and then, after fatally injuring Wu, reveal that they have by chance avoided ingesting the poison. 

Afterwards, the two friends wander off to refine Chien&#x27;s new technique, giving it its titular name.

==Production==
Prior to &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, Chan had worked for director Lo Wei who wanted to make him into the new &quot;Bruce Lee&quot; in films like &quot;New Fist of Fury&quot;. However, those films yielded relatively poor box office returns. When producer Ng See-yuen decided to make a comedy with Chan as the star, the concept did not initially meet with approval from the film distributors. However, Ng and Chan persevered and together with &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, this film launched Jackie Chan into national stardom.

The combination of comedy, martial arts, stunts and acrobatics had been done before, in Lau Kar-leung&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Spiritual Boxer&quot;. However, the release of &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; heralded a new direction for Hong Kong action movies.

Ng See-yuen and Yuen Woo-ping checked over many actors for the part of the old, eccentric, wandering Kung Fu master, before Ng suggested casting Yuen&#x27;s own father, Yuen Siu-tien. Yuen would continue to reprise the role of Beggar So several more times before his death in 1979.

According to his book &quot;I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action&quot;, Chan lost a tooth after Hwang Jang-lee kicked him in the face during a fight scene. His arm was also accidentally slashed by a sword that was supposed to be blunt, but while he was screaming in pain, the camera kept rolling.

==Music==
As well as original music by Chou Fu-liang, the film also features Jean Michel Jarre&#x27;s &quot;Oxygène (Part 2)&quot; and Space&#x27;s &quot;Magic Fly&quot;. Like many Hong Kong movies of the era, it also includes samples from western movie scores, including &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, &quot;Carrie&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

Film producer Serafim Karalexis got the rights to distribute the movie in America in the 80s, retitled &quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot;. It had a new score made due to copyright issues with the original score. The U.S. film and its promotional materials billed Chan as &quot;Jacky Chan.&quot;

==Box office==
At the Hong Kong box office, &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; earned HK$2,708,748.20 (), becoming the 13th-highest-grossing film of the year. In South Korea, it was the second-highest-grossing film of 1979 (behind Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;Drunken Master&quot;), with 765,930 box admissions in Seoul, equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately million (). Combined, the film grossed an estimated total of approximately in East Asia, equivalent to adjusted for inflation.

In 1979, a film titled &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow II&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Snaky Knight Fight Against Mantis&quot; (or &quot;Snaky Knight Fights the Mantis&quot;) was released. It was directed by Chang Hsin-yi and starred Wang Tao. However, the film was not a true sequel, rather it was an attempt by the studio to capitalize on the success of the original film. Footage including a montage and a fight scene from &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; were spliced into the film. Chan&#x27;s image was also used on the cover of some versions.

==Home releases==
*On 7 February 2000, Hong Kong Legends released a DVD containing a number of extras, including a photo gallery, Jackie Chan and Hwang Jang-lee&#x27;s biographies/filmographies, the English export trailer, and an interview with producer Ng See-yuen. However, it contains a cropped 2:35:1 to 1:78:1 image and the incorrect Mandarin dub with dubtitles. This DVD contains compulsory BBFC cuts amounting to roughly 45 seconds due to animal cruelty. The Chinese credit sequence is used (reverting to 2:35:1 during this section). The English dub is one created by US studios during the film&#x27;s release there (under the title &quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot;) to avoid copyright issues with music, but everything else is the same as the export dub commissioned by Seasonal Films.
*On 18 June 2002, Destination Films released the first legal DVD in the United States. Despite having uncut status and a full 2:35:1 image in the correct Cantonese language, it still contains dubtitles. The English dub (and credit sequence) is the export one and intact.
*On 16 February 2004, Mei Ah Entertainment released a remastered DVD in Hong Kong. It has uncut 2:35:1 anamorphic video. Audio include Cantonese Dolby Digital 5.1, Cantonese Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono and Mandarin Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono. Subtitles include Traditional, Simplified Chinese and English. Special features are limited to Cast and Crew Info and Synopsis.
* In May 2021, 88 Films released the film on Region B Blu-ray in the UK. This edition presents the film in 2.35:1, and features Cantonese, Mandarin, and English audio tracks. Bonus features include two audio commentaries (one by Mike Leeder and Arne Venema; the other by John Kreng and R.P. &quot;Kung Fu Bob&quot; O&#x27;Brien), an hour-long interview with Roy Horan, and an interview with George Clarke.

==Cultural impact==
The film established the blueprint for Jackie Chan&#x27;s kung fu comedy style, which he further developed with &quot;Drunken Master&quot; (1978) released later the same year. They both follow a similar plot structure, with Chan&#x27;s character being an underdog trained by Yuen Siu-tien&#x27;s beggar character. Dawn Taylor of &quot;The DVD Journal&quot; also notes that the film&#x27;s plot structure has been &quot;copied oh-so-many times by a variety of &quot;Karate Kid&quot;-type American films&quot; since the 1980s.

<doc id="652424" wikidata="Q735275" url="?curid=652424" title="Jetpac">
<text>Jetpac is a shooter video game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game and released for the ZX Spectrum and VIC-20 in 1983 and the BBC Micro in 1984. It is the first game to be released by Ultimate Play the Game, the company which later became Rare. The game follows Jetman as he must rebuild his rocket in order to explore different planets, while simultaneously defending against hostile aliens. It was written by Ultimate co-founder Chris Stamper with graphics designed by his brother, Tim Stamper. Reviewers praised &quot;Jetpac&quot;″s presentation and gameplay, and it won &quot;Game of the Year&quot; at the Golden Joystick Awards in 1983.

&quot;Jetpac&quot; has since been included as an unlockable minigame in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; and as part of the 2015 compilation &quot;Rare Replay&quot;. It was later included in a game compilation on the ZX Spectrum Vega. It spawned two direct sequels and a 2007 remake, &quot;Jetpac Refuelled&quot;, which was released for the Xbox Live Arcade service.

==Gameplay==
The game world is presented in a horizontal wraparound and consists of three platforms which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman must assemble his rocket (which spawns in pieces scattered around the map), and then fill it with fuel before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is broadly repeated with alternate procedures. In addition, the player has to defend themselves from the planet&#x27;s aliens, and for bonus points collect valuable resources which occasionally fall from above.

After the first level, the rocket stays assembled and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement has to be built before it can be refuelled for takeoff. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the core gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.

==Development==
Ultimate Play the Game was founded by brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, along with Tim&#x27;s wife, Carol, from their headquarters in Ashby-de-la-Zouch in 1982. They began producing multiple video games for the ZX Spectrum throughout the early 1980s. The company were known for their reluctance to reveal details about their operations and then-upcoming projects. Little was known about their development process except that they used to work in &quot;separate teams&quot;; one team would work on development whilst the other would concentrate on other aspects such as sound or graphics. While developing &quot;Jetpac&quot;, the Stamper brothers closely studied the burgeoning Japanese gaming market and had started to practice developing games for their then-upcoming console, the Famicom, later predicting that the ZX Spectrum had a limited lifespan.

&quot;Jetpac&quot; was one of the few Spectrum games also available in a ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing &quot;instantaneous&quot; loading of the game when the normal method of cassette loading took minutes. The game was also able to run on the 16K version of the Spectrum.

==Reception==
The game sold over 300,000 copies and generated £1 million in revenue for Ultimate Play the Game, which enabled the Stamper brothers to gain a foothold in the early video gaming market.

The game was critically acclaimed. &quot;Crash&quot; praised the graphics and presentation, citing that they were of &quot;the highest standard&quot; and added that it was &quot;difficult to find any real faults&quot; with the game. &quot;CVG&quot; similarly praised the graphics, stating that the presentation was &quot;superb&quot; and the gameplay was considered addictive. In a retrospective review, Chris Wilkins of Eurogamer noted that the colourful graphics and sound effects were advanced for the time, but what truly made for a &quot;faultless&quot; experience was its simple gameplay.

&quot;ZX Computing&quot; praised the game&#x27;s playability and replay value, stating that &quot;Jetpac&quot; was &quot;a very well put together piece of software&quot;. The game was number one in the first Spectrum sales chart published by &quot;CVG&quot;.
The ZX Spectrum version was voted number 73 in the &quot;Your Sinclair Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; in 1993 and was voted the 14th best game of all time by the readers of Retro Gamer for an article that was scheduled to be in a special &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; tribute issue. The game won the title &quot;Game of the Year&quot; at the 1983 Golden Joystick Awards.

==Legacy==
After the game&#x27;s release, &quot;Jetpac&quot; was parodied in a long-running &quot;Crash&quot; comic strip named &quot;Lunar Jetman&quot;. The strip, designed by John Richardson, lasted from July 1984 to October 1991 and gained popular reception from readers. To develop the comic, photographs had to be processed manually on a photomechanical tone and then transferred to paper, being fully colorized in the late 1980s.

&quot;Jetpac&quot; was followed by two sequels: &quot;Lunar Jetman&quot; (1983) and &quot;Solar Jetman&quot; (1990). The latter was not released for the ZX Spectrum, and a version for the Commodore 64 was finished but never released following disappointing sales of the original NES version.

Since its release, &quot;Jetpac&quot; has been included in a number of other games developed by Rare. The game is playable in &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;, where it could be unlocked to play in Cranky Kong&#x27;s laboratory after obtaining 15 Banana Medals. Beating Cranky Kong&#x27;s high score rewards the player with the Rareware Coin, which is necessary to beat the game. The game was retained in the April 2015 Virtual Console re-release of &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; on the Wii U, despite the property being technically owned by Microsoft. An enhanced remake of &quot;Jetpac&quot;, entitled &quot;Jetpac Refuelled&quot;, was released on the Xbox Live Arcade in March 2007. Microsoft&#x27;s E3 2015 press conference unveiled the compilation title &quot;Rare Replay&quot;, which has a selection of thirty games from Rare&#x27;s lifetime game library, including the original &quot;Jetpac&quot; and its two sequels and remake, making the &quot;Jetman&quot; series the most represented in the collection.

<doc id="652427" wikidata="Q27108" url="?curid=652427" title="Alexander Spotswood">
<text>Alexander Spotswood (12 December 1676 – 7 June 1740) was a British Army officer, explorer and lieutenant governor of Colonial Virginia; he is regarded as one of the most significant historical figures in British North American colonial history.

After a brilliant but unsatisfactory military career, in 1710 he was nominated colonial governor of Virginia, a post which he held for twelve years. During that period, Spotswood engaged in the exploration of the territories beyond the western border, of which he was the first to see the economic potentials. In 1716 he organised and led an expedition west of the mountains, known as Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition, with which he established the Crown&#x27;s dominion over the territory between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah Valley, thus taking a decisive step for the future British expansion to the West.

As the governor of Virginia, Spotswood&#x27;s first preoccupation was to make sea routes safe and fight against the pirates. After a long effort, the famous pirate Blackbeard was hunted down and killed in 1718. In addition, Spotswood promoted the economic growth of the colony by founding the metallurgical settlements of Germanna; introduced the juridical instrument of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;; and introduced the rules for the commercial relations with Native Americans and those for the tobacco export trade. His tenure was characterised by a growing conflict with the Virginian political classes, which ended with his removal from office.

Years later, between 1730 and 1739, Spotswood was Postmaster General for British America and, with his young friend Benjamin Franklin, extended the postal service network north of Williamsburg and improved its efficiency.

At the outbreak of the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, Spotswood was called back into army service. Promoted to major general, he was put in command of the colonial troops stationed in America with the task of preparing a military action against the Spanish stronghold of Cartagena de Indias, but, in Annapolis, where he was to consult with the local governors, he died suddenly in 1740.

== Origins and youth ==

Alexander Spotswood was born in Tangier, a city on the African shore of the Strait of Gibraltar, in 1676. At that time the city, under English occupation, was run by a local governor and housed a garrison, where Spotswood&#x27;s father, Robert, practiced as surgeon, first as surgeon George Elliott&#x27;s assistant, succeeding him when he died and marrying his widow, Catharine Maxwell, who gave him an only son, Alexander. Alexander&#x27;s older half-brother (by his mother&#x27;s first marriage to George Elliott) was Roger Elliott, who became one of the first governors of Gibraltar.

Both parents had Scottish origins, and the father, although economically ruined, could boast an illustrious lineage as a direct descendant of Robert the Bruce. His family had ancient baronial origins and had enjoyed great prestige until the time of the English revolution. There had been illustrious Spotswoods, such as judge Robert Spottiswoode (Alexander&#x27;s grandfather) and Archbishop John Spottiswoode.

In 1684, following attacks of native Berber troops under the guide of governor Ali ben Abdallah, the city of Tangier was evacuated and the Spotswood family returned to England, where the father died in 1688. In May 1693, at the age of sixteen, Spotswood enlisted in the English Army, the army of the Kingdom of England, with the rank of Ensign in the Earl of Bath&#x27;s Regiment of Foot. He served first in Ireland and then in the Flanders. Over the years, distinguishing himself for skill, courage and intelligence, he climbed the military hierarchy to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

== First army experience ==

The War of Spanish Succession broke out in 1701. The main European powers fought each other throughout the following decade. 
John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, was in command of the English army stationed in central Europe. Alexander Spotswood was part of it as deputy quartermaster general. The troops remained quartered along the River Rhine for three years for the protection of the Netherlands. Marlborough&#x27;s army descended into Bavaria In 1704, taking the Franco-Bavarian forces by surprise. The Battle of Blenheim took place on August 13 and ended in a major British victory. During the battle Spotswood was severely wounded in the chest during a heavy artillery attack. Medicated on the battlefield, he was then sent to London to convalesce. He survived the and kept the cannonball, which he used to show his friends and guests.

He returned to the Flanders almost two years later. On 11 July 1708 he fought in the Battle of Oudenaarde, in the Netherlands, where his horse was killed and he fell prisoner to the French troops. But Duke of Marlborough, once again the winner of the battle, obtained his release by negotiating personally with the enemy, and Spotswood returned to his duties as quartermaster general to oversee the corn supply for the troops.

However, his disappointment for the slowdown of his military career was growing. Despite the good relationship with and the trust of his superiors, he was stuck in the rank of lieutenant colonel. His ambitions, fuelled by the many but never kept promises of promotion, were continuously frustrated. In September 1709, having spent half of his life in the army, he took his leave and returned to London.

== Governor of Virginia ==
During the war, Spotswood had made good friends not only with the Duke of Marlborough, but also with another of his commanders, George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney. Hamilton had held the post of governor of the colony of Virginia from 1704, but resided in London and was represented on American soil by a plenipotentiary delegate, with a nominal mandate as deputy governor. 
In 1707 the deputy governor, Robert Hunter, had been captured by the French at sea and the colony was thus temporarily administered by a local government. At the suggestion of Hamilton himself, with perhaps an additional push by Marlborough, on February 18, 1710 Queen Anne appointed Spotswood as vice governor of Virginia. On April 3, Spotswood left for the Americas from the port of Spithead, in southern England, aboard the man-of-war HMS &quot;Deptford&quot;, in convoy with other British ships to ward off pirate attacks.

At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Virginia was the most prosperous and populous of the Thirteen Colonies. The inhabitants numbered around 80,000, including 20,000 slaves – most of them from the Bight of Biafra – employed in the vast tobacco plantations, at the service of a confederation of landowners.
The export of tobacco was still one of the most lucrative activities, but in recent times, due to the war against the French and the consequent closure of the Atlantic trade routes, it was not as rewarding as in the past, and overproduction had caused prices to drop. In addition, in a period considered the golden age of piracy, the southern waters of British America were swarming with pirates and corsairs. Coming from the Caribbean Sea, they sailed northwards along the American coastline as far as Virginia, making harmful raids. 
Moreover, the land borders of the colony were at that time threatened by the aggressive behaviour of numerous Native American tribes.

=== Arrival at the colony ===

After ten weeks of good navigation, the convoy arrived in Virginia on June 20, and landed at the Hampton Roads bay (then known as &quot;Kecoughtan&quot;, the local Algonquian name). Three days later, Spotswood was in Williamsburg, the capital of the colony, where he was sworn in as governor, in the newly built Capitol. The Virginians gave him an enthusiastic welcome, both because he was the first governor present on the territory after four vacant years, and because he brought with him a royal decree that extended to colonial citizens the right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, granted to the subjects in England since the time of the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; of 1689.

For the previous four years the colony had been ruled by the twelve members of the Governor&#x27;s Council, who were appointed by the King. Just like the fifty representatives of the House of Burgesses (who were elected by their Virginian peers), they belonged to the class of the great landowners whose real aim was to establish a &quot;de facto&quot; oligarchy.
Their interests often clashed with those of the Crown, and in the oversea territories their interests generally prevailed.
On July 5 Spotswood made his first encounter with this problem. A resolution passed by the Governor&#x27;s Council prior to his arrival had abolished the application of the annual payments for the tobacco lease and established the principle that tobacco be exchanged at a public sale.
Now, considering the low revenues, the Crown had decided to return to the old method of trade, but the Governor&#x27;s Council, whose members controlled the public sale of tobacco, refused to implement the new rule.
Spotswood favoured the council&#x27;s opinion, and this was the first public conflict of interests between the Crown, of which Spotswood would be for years to come a staunch supporter, and the wishes of the local ruling classes.

On October 26 of the same year began a long meeting of the House of Burgesses and the Governor&#x27;s Council – the first since 1706 – during which Spotswood listed some points in the program he intended to implement, namely,: to strengthen the military defence of the colony; to keep down the number of slaves escaping from the plantations; to extend the postal service; to complete the construction of the Governor&#x27;s Palace in Williamsburg. 
In addition, following the Crown&#x27;s suggestions, he proposed to rebuild the College of William &amp; Mary which had been destroyed by a fire five years earlier, and to establish a court of &quot;oyer and terminer&quot; (a sort of superior criminal court) that would have to meet every six months.

=== Threats at the borders ===

Meanwhile, another pressing issue reawakened his military vocation. 
A colonial militia of about 15,000 men was deployed to protect the land borders. The majority of the troop came from the lower labouring classes, were poorly armed and operated under the orders of inexperienced commanders.
Since his arrival in Virginia, Spotswood had shown concern about the colony&#x27;s vulnerability and had started to reorganise and strengthen the militia to match the task of defending the colony.
During the summer of 1711, he personally supervised the installation of a series of cannons in the ports between Yorktown and Jamestown to prevent a possible French naval invasion.

In September 1711, the Tuscarora, an Indian nation whose territories extended from Virginia to the heart of North Carolina, engaged in an extended period of conflict with the settlers for commercial and border protection reasons and, during a series of attacks on settlements and plantations on the Carolina-Virginia border, killed hundreds of colonists.
That was the beginning of the so-called Tuscarora War. Spotswood, well aware that it was a real war, considering how badly equipped the militia was, requested weapons and ammunition from England, which however would take a few months to arrive. His aim being to prevent other tribes from joining the Tuscarora revolt, he headed south with the 15,000 militia men and stopped on the bank of the Nottoway River. The local tribes proved to be well disposed towards the British and offered them military support against the Tuscarora.
As a guarantee, Spotswood demanded that each tribe deliver two of the young sons of the tribal chiefs as hostages, to be educated in Williamsburg at the College of William &amp; Mary. The objective was twofold: to give them a Christian education, so that they could return later as missionaries to their own tribes – within the framework of a wider operation to civilise the Indians –, and at the same time to guarantee for a certain period of time the friendship of those tribes.

In early December, hostages from several tribes arrived in Williamsburg. The House of Burgesses, however, was not happy about this resolution, as they would have liked a more direct military action against the Indians. 
Spotswood argued that a field operation could not be sustained and that his initiatives were, for the time being, &quot;a sober way of waging war.&quot; However, an amount of £20,000 was set aside to wage war against the Tuscarora, and discussions carried on until Christmas, when Spotswood dissolved the assembly.
Between the summer and the fall of the following year, some of the rebel Tuscarora chiefs were captured and transferred to North Carolina for trial.

=== Contrasts with the House of Burgesses ===

The War of Spanish Succession ended in April 1713, and the British victory led to the reopening of the Atlantic trade routes and the annexation of new colonies. The Virginian economy was revitalised, and in particular the tobacco export trade which in recent years had been severely affected by the conflict.
Tobacco in those days was also used as a means of payment and was sold by the weight. To make more profit traders often added poor quality to high-quality varieties, causing prices to drop. Previous colonial governments had made attempts on several occasions to regulate the trade, but nothing had ever really come of it.

So, in November 1713, Spotswood, to bring the tobacco market under control and set limits to the practices of the big landowners, submitted to the House of Burgesses the &quot;Tobacco Inspection Act&quot;. 
The new law, supported by the Governor&#x27;s Council, required tobacco to be inspected before shipment to Europe. 
In Spotswood&#x27;s intentions there would thus be a reduction in the quantities exported, resulting in an increase in the quality of the goods and a consequent increase in demand and in price.
To soften the opposition of the House of Burgesses&#x27;, Spotswood appointed as inspectors some of the representatives in favour of his proposal, which was finally approved. The reform, however, produced only partial results compared with the expectations: prices did not rise immediately, and the inspection procedure was disliked by the landowners.

Yet another initiative by Spotswood caused him to lose the favour of the Virginian elite. In December 1714, he had the &quot;Indian Trade Act&quot; passed.
All commercial activities with the Indians south of the James River were placed under the exclusive control of the Virginia Indian Company, established with an allocation of £10,000.
The measure should have put an end to the illegal trade that took place along the border and which, according to Spotswood, was one of the reasons for the unrest of the Indians, and at the same time was against the interests of the colonials who were trading privately with the Indian tribes.
William Byrd II, an influential member of the Governor&#x27;s Council who wanted Spotswood&#x27;s position for himself, was in control of much of the trade with the Indians, particularly the Cherokee, to whom he sold cloth and weapons. Shortly after the law was passed, Byrd left for England on personal business, but certainly also with the intention of bringing Spotswood discredit in the various branches of the royal administration.

The disputes between Spotswood and the members of the House of Burgesses grew until they degenerated in 1715. 
During an assembly held between August and September the representatives, instead of concentrating on the problems of the colony&#x27;s defence as was Spotswood&#x27;s recommendation, challenged the &quot;Indian Trade Act&quot; and the &quot;Tobacco Inspection Act&quot;. The discontent generated by the latter among landowners and merchants had played a fundamental role in the last elections of the House of Burgesses. Almost all the representatives who had previously supported the act had lost their seat, and a large section of the newly elected were in disagreement.
The scarce rainfall of the previous year had provided the tobacco traders with reasons to justify the request of being allowed to sell all the tobacco produced, regardless of its quality, ignoring therefore the provisions of the &quot;Tobacco Inspection Act&quot;.

After five weeks of time-wasting discussions – which irritated him all the more now that some Indian tribes at the border were becoming hostile, putting the application of the &quot;Indian Trade Act&quot; at risk –, Spotswood put an end to the debates and closed the assembly.
It was not so much the closing of the Assembly that intensified the hostility of the representatives against the governor, it was rather his definition of the House of Burgesses as &quot;a Set of Representatives, whom Heaven has not generally endowed with the Ordinary Qualifications requisite to Legislators&quot;.
In early 1716, an anonymous letter from Virginia to the London Board of Trade denounced Spotswood for alleged violations of the law, even more strongly than previous still anonymous letters, and accused him of greed and tyranny.

=== First explorations of the western frontier ===
Despite the contrasts with the House of Burgesses, during the middle years of his tenure, Spotswood concentrated mainly on the exploration beyond the western frontier, beyond the foothills of Piedmont.
On account of the Tuscarora war, the situation at the border had become tense again, but after one hundred years of periods of war followed by periods of peace, the British and the Indians had learned that, in the absence of a winner, they had better try and live together.
To deal with the Indian threat, since his arrival in Virginia Spotswood had sent rangers to patrol the border and explorers in search of a pass through the Blue Ridge Mountains.
In the spring of 1714, he personally joined an expedition to explore the upper reaches of the York and Mattaponi Rivers.
These explorations took place for precise strategic purposes. The French had long been trying to open a connection between their colonies in New France and the forts along the Mississippi River; their possible success – which Spotswood believed imminent – would soon cut off the British from the interior of the region, based as they were along the coast near the mouth of the James River.

In the summer of 1714, having sufficiently secured the borders, Spotswood went into action by establishing two forest settlements beyond the Tidewater border, which for the past century had signed the limit of British expansion.
The first settlement, Fort Christanna, stood on the southern bank of the Meherrin River, near the border with North Carolina.
Built for the headquarters of the Virginia Indian Company, the company created under the &quot;Indian Trade Act&quot;, the fort housed a school for the education of Indians to the Christian way of life.
Spotswood&#x27;s objectives, in addition to those of immediate strategic utility already pursued at the time of the Tuscarora war, were ambitious: to turn the traditionally semi-nomadic Indians into a resident population.

The second settlement established by Spotswood was Germanna, situated north of a bend of the Rapidan River. 
A group of refugees from the Palatinate, arrived in America in 1709 with the approval of Queen Anne following the destruction of their lands during the War of Spanish Succession, had settled in the region and they had discovered deposits of silver and iron. Initially, nine families of German Protestants settled in Germanna, working for the local smelting furnaces.

In October 1714, news came that Queen Anne had died in early August.
During the assembly of the House of Burgesses following the event, Spotswood proclaimed the new king, George I of Great Britain, and claimed the results obtained during the summer: the frontier had been secured; the economy was improving and the defence costs had been reduced thanks to the building of Fort Christanna, which made it easier to control the Indians by concentrating their commercial interests in a single area, and thanks to Germanna, where mining was already a profitable activity.

=== Knights of the golden horseshoe expedition ===

1716 saw the results of the previous explorations in the western territories. 
On June 12, Spotswood reported to the Governor&#x27;s Council that some rangers had found a passage through the mountains and offered himself to lead an expedition beyond Piedmont, in regions then unknown.
The Council approved the proposal, on the consideration of its commercial and strategic potential.

Spotswood left Williamsburg with a few men on August 20, 1716, and headed for Germanna, where a meeting point had been fixed. Here the expeditionary force was formed, and on 29 August a group of sixty-three men set off for the mountains. The group included influential members of the settlers&#x27; community, servants, rangers, native guides and a good number of horses and dogs.
The group went up the Rapidan River, hunting animals and toasting the new king, through a dense bushy area crossed by numerous water streams. 
During the march, some men contracted measles and were left behind in a field hospital readily set up and manned by rangers. The rest of the group proceeded under the threats of bears and rattlesnakes, until they reached the source of the Rapidan River on the Blue Ridge Mountains, on 5 September.

They crossed the mountains passing through a gorge by the name of Swift Run Gap at an altitude of 720 m, bordered by two mountain peaks. Spotswood named George the higher of the two in honour of the king, and his companions named the other Alexander in his honour.
They descended from the ridge towards the Shenandoah Valley: the first Westerners to set eyes and foot on it.
Crossing woods and meadows populated by elks and buffalos, after about ten kilometres they reached the bottom of the valley and the course of the Shenandoah River, which was renamed Euphrates.
Gun shots were fired here in honour of the king and a great toast was held.
Spotswood engraved the king&#x27;s name on a rock and in an empty wine bottle introduced a card containing the British claim on the river and its territory. The bottle was buried in the riverbank.

On September 7, the company left for Germanna, and in ten days was back in Williamsburg. 
The following winter, Spotswood gave each member of the expedition a miniature gold horseshoe with engraved in Latin: &quot;Sic juvat transcendere montes&quot; (&quot;This is the way to cross the mountains&quot;).
Since then, the expedition was also known as &quot;Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition&quot; and described by Spotswood&#x27;s biographer, Walter Havighurst, as &quot;the most romantic episode in the history of Virginia&quot;.
It played a leading historical role not so much for the practical results it achieved, but for the impulse and the inspiration it provided for those who later wanted to venture in the exploration of the interior of the American colonies.

The expedition also left considerable traces in American literature. 
A few months after the company&#x27;s return, a humanities professor at the College of William &amp; Mary, Arthur Blackamore wrote a short poem in Latin celebrating the expedition: &quot;Expeditio Ultramontana&quot;. The original Latin text, considered to be among the best examples of Latin poetry in 18th century America, has been lost, but the English version that George Seagood produced in 1729 survives in its entirety.

Over a century later, in 1835, William Alexander Caruthers published a chivalric novel, &quot;The Knights of the Golden Horse-Shoe&quot;, telling a somewhat revisited history of the expedition.
In the 20th century, the poet Gertrude Claytor wrote a commemorative poem of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition. Engraved on a bronze plaque, in 1934 it was posted near Swift Run Gap.

=== Opposition in London and in Williamsburg ===
The success of the Transmontane Expedition was welcomed in the London administrative offices, but in less than a year a severe blow to the Spotswood&#x27;s peace of mind came from the capital. At the beginning of the year 1717, a large group of influential London merchants wrote a letter to the Board of Trade declaring that the legislation promoted by Spotswood harmed the commercial interests of both the motherland and Virginia itself.
The merchants reported that, due to the corruption of the inspectors by the landowners, the lower quality production was not only still on the market – in contradiction with the purposes of the &quot;Tobacco Inspection Act&quot; – but had actually overtaken the higher quality varieties.
The Virginia Indian Company&#x27;s monopoly on trade with Indians also deprived the merchants of a lucrative market, and this, coupled with heavy export regulations, made their activities unprofitable. The merchants therefore asked for the abolition of those laws which they considered an obstacle to the development of trade.

The king thus put a veto on the &quot;Tobacco Inspection Act&quot; and on the &quot;Indian Trade Act&quot;, and Spotswood was forced to revoke both. 
William Byrd, in a letter from England to Philip Ludwell, a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council, wrote that he had contributed to the abrogation of those laws and to the weakening of the position and influence of the governor. The House of Burgesses opposed public funding of Fort Christanna, which had to be dismantled as a consequence, although Spotswood feared that this would destabilise the border, leaving local Indian tribes without British support and at the mercy of the Carolina tribes. This put an end to the &quot;Indian Trade Act&quot;, but not to the principles it sought to implement, which remained central in Spotswood&#x27;s policy for years to come. As for the &quot;Tobacco Inspection Act&quot;, on the other hand, years later, in 1730, the same measures were successfully re-proposed and did not meet as strong an opposition as previously.

In all probability, the hostility of the House of Burgesses, rather than to a genuine intention to favour trade, was due to its tendency to oppose the actions of the governor, who had been fighting for years with the representatives for the effective control of the colony. During this period of time, in addition to William Byrd&#x27;s mission to London, other members of the Governor&#x27;s Council were openly taking position against Spotswood. The most determined among them was the Reverend James Blair, delegate of the Bishop of London and president of the College of William &amp; Mary, one of the most powerful men in the colony, who had already been behind the dismissal of past governors Edmund Andros and Francis Nicholson.

The reason for this opposition was once again to be found in the resistance, on the part of the Virginians, to royal prerogatives affirmed by Spotswood, who claimed for the governor the right to appoint judges in criminal trials (through procedures called &quot;oyer and terminer&quot;). The members of the council, on the other hand, claimed to be the only ones entitled to do so. In any case, the Virginian popular opinion supported the governor, who was particularly popular with the small landowners, the yeomen class. And, despite Byrd&#x27;s scheming against him in London and the revocation of his laws, Spotswood still enjoyed the protection of the King&#x27;s ministers and of the members of the Board of Trade.

=== Of pirates and Indians ===

In a letter sent in August 1717 to Secretary of State Joseph Addison, Spotswood reported that the only sources of concern left to impair the peace and quiet of the colony were piracy and the aggressive nature of the Indians.
Just a few months earlier, several armed Seneca gangs had moved from the Province of New York to the Virginia border, where they had engaged in raids and robberies.

In March 1717, some chiefs of the Catawba tribe had gone to Fort Christanna to discuss a trade treaty with the British and Spotswood, who had long-awaited the good disposition of the Indians, had joined them. In the days of the meeting an episode took place which risked compromising the negotiations. One night, some Seneca or Mohawk Indians – enemies of the Catawba – entered the fort, where the governor was lying asleep, and killed some members of the delegation, who were not bearing arms as Spotswood had imposed. Others were kidnapped. Initially, the Catawba accused the British of having betrayed them and started to leave, but Spotswood, who was in danger of seeing his plans to secure the border undermined, sent a contingent to recover the abducted, reaffirmed his friendship with the Indians, and promised them greater protection. In the end, the Catawba agreed to trade at Fort Christanna and leave some of their children there to study, and the border situation seemed to improve, at least temporarily.
The other looming threat were the pirates, who attacked ports and robbed ships, greatly hampering trade. 
The most famous and feared among them, Edward Teach, who went down in history as Blackbeard, had recently returned to sail the seas, having received the King&#x27;s pardon and having later surrendered to the governor of North Carolina, Charles Eden, who was probably in cahoots with him.
When Blackbeard attacked a convoy of ships in front of Charleston Harbor in May 1718, looting and taking prisoners, the Carolina residents sought help from neighbouring Virginia.
Although he did not have a specific mandate from the king – which was necessary for the arrest and trial of pirates –, Spotswood decided to intervene, wary of Carolina&#x27;s possibilities of dealing with the problem.
He quickly had former &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; quartermaster William Howard arrested, who had apparently retired from piracy and lived in Virginia, suspecting that he was still in contact with Blackbeard. 
From Howard, later pardoned, he learned that Blackbeard was with a few men in one of his usual shelters, the Ocracoke Inlet.

Ocracoke was in North Carolina, out of his jurisdiction, but Spotswood was now determined to capture the pirate as quickly as possible, dead or alive, even by violating the sovereignty of another colony.
So, without waiting for the authorization of the House of Burgesses, he sent two warships against Blackbeard under the command of Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard. 
On November 22, 1718, after five days of search, the pirates were taken by surprise. Maynard, aboard HMS &quot;Pearl&quot;, attacked Blackbeard&#x27;s ship, who was killed in a short and bloody fight. Nine of his men died with him, and Maynard lost a dozen of his men.
Two days later, Maynard returned to Jamestown with fifteen prisoners, who were later hanged, and Blackbeard&#x27;s severed head was stuck on the tip of the bowsprit.

=== Home politics: towards a truce ===

The apparent quiet at the borders was the background of new conflicts within the colony. 
Spotswood soon faced sharp criticism from the House of Burgesses for his moves against the pirates, and when a dispute arose between Spotswood and Eden, the governor of North Carolina, over the legality of the arrest and killing of Blackbeard and his crew (they happened to be under the jurisdiction of North Carolina). Some members of the House of Burgesses published a controversial pamphlet in which they reported of illegal proceedings on the part of Spotswood and in particular of the lack of prior consultation with Governor Eden.
It appears that Spotswood was highly likely aware of Eden&#x27;s political weaknesses and of his compromises with the pirates, and that he purposely omitted to seek his cooperation.

At the same time, relations with the Governor&#x27;s Council also reached a critical point. In the early months of 1719, with the dispute over the pirates unresolved, a hard dispute arose over the powers of some sectors of the Church.
Led by James Blair and other members of the council, a first group was in favour of the current law which provided for the clergy to be directly appointed by an assembly of parishioners and without the approval of the governor. 
This law, which made the position of individual clergymen uncertain and dependent on the mood of parish assemblies, prompted a large part of the Virginia clergy to support Spotswood in his efforts to modify the law and give the governor, as the King&#x27;s representative, the power to assign the clerical positions.
Both sides turned to the Bishop of London, accusing each other of interference and abuse of power.
The Bishop of London then called for an assembly of all the clergymen of Virginia to take place in Williamsburg in April at the College of William &amp; Mary, in the presence of Blair and Spotswood.
Since the assembly failed to reach a decision, the situation remained unchanged and thus Blair was the winner of the contest

This growing hostility of the council had already manifested itself during the previous year and Spotswood, unable to bring it under control, had tried to change its composition. 
In November 1718, he asked the Board of Trade to remove some advisers hostile to him, including Blair and Byrd, who was still in London, and to replace them with men he trusted.
The Board of Trade did not fully comply with Spotswood&#x27;s requests: only two of the men he proposed were appointed and the only councillor removed, Byrd – who returned to Virginia early in 1720 – was almost immediately reinstated.

1720 was the year of a change. Unable to get rid of them, the governor tried to make peace with the members of the council. Byrd, who was now resident in Virginia and could therefore be more easily controlled, became Spotswood&#x27;s point of reference. The two met at the Capitol and resolved to cooperate. On April 29, 1720, during the next assembly of the council, the governor and the councillors officially declared their resolve to work in harmony from then on.
In this more relaxed situation, Spotswood obtained land concessions near Germanna and the western frontier, for a total of approximately 86,000 acres, where he began to build his private residence.
The Spotswood estate formed the core of the Spotsylvania County, which was established in 1720 in his honour.

Meanwhile, the buildings of the Governor&#x27;s Palace and of the Bruton Parish Church in Williamsburg, which Spotswood had personally collaborated to design, were completed.
The Governor&#x27;s palace, in particular, was the subject of criticism for its pomp and excessive costs, but its architecture was appreciated, so much so that in its time it became a model for all residences of prestige.

The truce made official in 1720, although sincerely wanted by the parties involved, appears as a prelude to the final attack against Spotswood. During the summer of the following year, Byrd and Blair left for England, there to reiterate more forcefully their efforts against the governor.

=== Last years of government ===
Despite the territorial expansion established with the Expedition over the mountains, Spotswood deemed it necessary for Great Britain to expand further northwest, as far as the Great Lakes, to gain strategic advantage in view of an imminent war against the French. He had already obtained an accurate map of the entire western area of the Mississippi River System, hitherto virtually unknown to the 
British, to be used for an expedition to Lake Erie, where Spotswood intended to establish a settlement.
In February 1720, Spotswood proposed to go on a secret mission to London to present these ideas to the government and to illustrate in detail how it was possible and necessary to conquer Spanish Florida by attacking the Spaniards in St. Augustine, in order to prevent the French fleet from entering the waters of the Thirteen colonies from the Gulf of Mexico.

The secret missions never took place, and Spotswood, during his last two years as governor, concentrated instead on resolving the Indian question.
If piracy was in rapid decline after Blackbeard&#x27;s death, the problems caused by the hostile and bellicose Indian tribes were increasingly worrying.
The first outbreak was on the Maryland border, and was fuelled by hostilities between the neighbouring tribes and those of Virginia. In the fall of 1720, tribes from Maryland attacked plantations in the Northern Neck, whereupon Spotswood, with the support of the governor of Maryland, called a meeting with the ambassadors of the five Iroquois Confederation tribes who were in conflict with the Virginia Indians.
During the meeting, which took place in Williamsburg in October 1721, three of the five ambassadors died, possibly poisoned. Despite this event, of which the Iroquois suspected the Virginia Indians, an agreement was reached by which the Potomac River became the frontier between the Indians of Virginia and the Iroquois, and no Indian was to cross it without the authorization of the British.

Encouraged by the results, Spotswood began organizing a general meeting with the Iroquois tribes and their &quot;Sachems&quot; (supreme leaders), with the collaboration with the governors of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York.
By June 1722, the time was ripe for Spotswood to sail from Virginia with one delegate from the Governor&#x27;s Council and one from the House of Burgesses, and many gifts for the Iroquois from the Virginia Indians and from the colony&#x27;s government. 
He set sail for New York and from there, along with Pennsylvania governor William Keith and some New York government spokesmen, he left by land for the city of Albany, located on the banks of the Hudson River.

The delegation, which arrived in Albany on August 20, was the most representative the British had ever set up in the Thirteen Colonies, and their commitment must have impressed the Indians. Within a few days they were joined by the leaders and warriors of the Mohicans, Oneida, Cayuga, Onondaga, and Seneca; practically all the nations in the Iroquois Confederation, followed later by the Powhatans and other tribes from Virginia. 
On August 29 the conference began, and Spotswood gave the inaugural address, during which he expressed hope for the continuing collaboration between the British and the Indians and reaffirmed that the Virginia tribes had had nothing to do with the death of the three Iroquois ambassadors in Williamsburg a few months earlier.
He gave the Indian Chiefs pearl necklaces as a gift to demonstrate British good will. Then he asked officially for confirmation of their commitment of the previous year to put an end to the raids in Piedmont and to respect the natural boundaries of the Blue Ridge Mountains and of the Potomac River. The Indians took about ten days to answer, then the agreement, which was Spotswood&#x27;s main objective, was ratified.

On 12 September, the conference ended. During the farewell ceremony with the Indian leaders, Spotswood made a gesture of high symbolic value: he detached from the collar of his jacket a gold pin in the shape of a miniature horseshoe, like the one he had given to his companions for the Transmontane Expedition, which he used to wear as a good luck charm, and gave it to the Iroquois sachems, explaining that they could use it as a pass to go on a mission to Williamsburg. Spotswood also made a personal gift to the Indians of fine fabrics and work tools. Then he left by ship along the Hudson River, heading for the open sea.

=== Removal from office ===

When he arrived in Williamsburg, Spotswood learned that, despite the popular support he enjoyed, the king had decided to revoke his position as governor.
On September 25, with Spotswood back in Williamsburg, James Blair, who had been absent for the past 12 months, and the new governor, Hugh Drysdale, an Irishman, arrived in the New World on the same ship. The Drysdale nomination, dated April 3, 1722, was made official and Drysdale was sworn in as governor on September 27.

Historians are in disaccord when explaining the reasons behind the removal of Spotswood from office. 
Walter Havighurst identified Spotswood&#x27;s character as main cause; a strong, sharp, and sometimes authoritarian character, prone to the regime of obedience in the military tradition, which the Virginia aristocracy was neither used to nor willing to accept.
In fact, during the twelve years at the helm in Virginia, the governor ended up into a conflict with each one of the strong powers of the colony, as well as with the more influential of his own men, from merchants to large landowners. 
The causes of his removal, which are never explicitly expressed in the official documents of the time, must be sought, according to Havighurst, in the controversy over the &quot;oyer and terminer&quot; courts, or over the more recent controversy on the clergymen&#x27;s appointment.
However, the overall policy adopted by Spotswood was inevitably destined to enter into conflict with the political class of Virginia, representative of landowners and merchants interests, whose dominance and political interference Spotswood sought to stem, in particularly James Blair&#x27;s and William Byrd&#x27;s, who had the means, in terms of both power and influence, to overthrow a governor.

The evaluations of Spotswood&#x27;s contemporaries were also discordant. Harsh criticisms of some aspects of his work can be found in the writings of James Blair and William Byrd, whose letters have been preserved. Equally high praise, however, can be found in Robert Beverley (see his &quot;History and Present State of Virginia&quot;), who was one of the first historians born in Virginia, as well as Spotswood&#x27;s companion in the Transmontane Expedition.
Another Spotswood&#x27;s political ally, Hugh Jones, professor at the College of William &amp; Mary, wrote in 1724, (&quot;The Present State of Virginia&quot;), that Virginia had become more civilised in the twelve years of Spotswood&#x27;s tenure than in the previous one hundred years.

Among modern historians prevails a generally positive opinion about the Spotswood administration: brilliant and significant in its character; a strong guide in a period of economic growth and cultural development.
Historian John Fiske, in the late nineteenth century, described Spotswood as one of the best and most capable governors of the British colonial period in America and praised him in particular for the founding of the Germanna smelting plant and for the audacity of the Transmontane Expedition. The same opinion was expressed by historian Virginius Dabney, who described Spotswood as the most celebrated among the governors of Virginia during the colonial period.

== Between Virginia and England ==

After the experience of government, Spotswood moved to his private residence situated along the Rappahannock River, near Germanna, where he devoted himself to the administration of his large estate and to the management of his metallurgical enterprise. 
Part of the production of iron and cast iron was exported to England and the rest was destined to the local market. 
For the other activities, mining and agriculture, Spotswood made use at first of the Palatine refugees he had introduced in Germanna almost ten years earlier, and when the contract that bound them to him expired, he resorted to slaves from Africa. 
Spotswood&#x27;s activities also included raising livestock, producing naval supplies, pitch, tar, and turpentine.

However, having assigned land to himself in large quantities during his tenure as governor, he was accused in some circles of land grabbing. So, with the intention of coming to an advantageous agreement with the British Government in London on the amount of taxes due, and at the same time consolidating his right of ownership, Spotswood left for England in 1724. His stay in England lasted longer than expected on account of some complications, which included quantifying the extension of the land in his possession and the amount of tax to be paid. It lasted in all five years.

Up till now, at age forty-eight, Spotswood had remained a bachelor waiting for the opportunity to marry a woman of high social standing. Now, on this occasion and in the capital, shortly after his arrival, Spotswood married Anne Butler Brayne, the daughter of a London esquire and godchild of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormond. 
They had four children, two boys and two girls.

== The last years ==

Having obtained favourable tax conditions, in February 1729 Spotswood crossed the Atlantic for the fourth and final time, with his wife and children. During his absence, the volume of production in the metallurgical plant had dropped and some slaves had escaped, but this had not affected the activities in the estate as a whole. On the contrary, the prolonged active state of the furnaces made this the first stable site of this type in all of North America.
As a private citizen, Spotswood financed the construction of a church in Germanna and began building another private residence in his own forest along the Rappahannock River. The construction ended in 1732. The structure, which was destroyed in the 1750s, had a park and a cherry tree boulevard, and was larger than the Williamsburg Governor&#x27;s Palace. 
During this period, Spotswood made peace with William Byrd. After the completion of the building Byrd wrote a detailed description of the residence, which he called an &quot;enchanted castle&quot;, and of the solitary and measured lifestyle of its owner.

During this time, Spotswood acquired another property near Yorktown, called Temple Farm. A few decades later the house, known as Moore House from the surname of Spotswood&#x27;s son-in-law who inherited it, was the theatre of a crucial episode of the American Revolution, when in 1781 General Charles Cornwallis signed the final British surrender.

During the last few years of his life, Spotswood stayed away from the frenzy of political life. At the time of Byrd&#x27;s visit, some ministers in London were thinking of offering him (as Byrd testifies) the post of governor of the colony of Jamaica, with the task of taking Spanish Havana with a military action. However, nothing came of it, as it was eventually decided to resort to more peaceful ways of dealing with the Spaniards.
Spotswood accepted instead a less up-front mandate, which allowed him to return to projects developed during his years as governor: in 1730 he was appointed with a ten-year term Postmaster General for the thirteen colonies and the West Indies.

At the time, the postal system covered only the coastal strip extending from New England to Pennsylvania up to Philadelphia. Virginia, cut off from courier routes, received mail once every two weeks.
In 1732, Spotswood extended the postal system to Williamsburg, where the mail started to arrive on a weekly basis. Spotswood also entered into a partnership with the young publisher Benjamin Franklin, with whom he developed a personal friendship, appointing him, in 1737, postmaster for his city, Philadelphia.

== War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear and death ==

In October 1739, due to the constant attacks on the English merchant navy by Spanish naval ships, Britain declared war on Spain. The conflict would go down in history as the war of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, named after an English captain whose ear was cut off by the Spaniards. 
Spotswood, who had not lost interest in military affairs, proposed to the general command of London that he personally recruit a regiment of volunteers to be employed in South America. Having obtained approval, he was appointed major general and quartermaster of the troops stationed in America, crowning thus with a promotion his military career.
He was to be the leader and the organiser of a military expedition against the Spanish stronghold of Cartagena de Indias, in present-day Colombia.

At the beginning of the following May, Spotswood travelled to Annapolis, Maryland, to consult with the local governors, wait there for the arrival of his troops and later to set sail with them. 
But in Annapolis he was taken ill, and his death came quickly, on June 7, 1740, at the age of sixty-four.
The expedition to Cartagena was postponed for a year, when the British forces placed the city under siege, but were utterly defeated.

Spotswood&#x27;s body was probably buried in Annapolis, but it is possible that it was brought back home to his Temple Farm property near Yorktown and buried near the York River.
In any case, the memory of Spotswood, and in particular of his government, lasted in Williamsburg for a long time to come.

<text>An oppidum (: oppida) is a large fortified Iron Age settlement or town. &quot;Oppida&quot; are primarily associated with the Celtic late La Tène culture, emerging during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, spread across Europe, stretching from Britain and Iberia in the west to the edge of the Hungarian Plain in the east. These settlements continued to be used until the Romans conquered Southern and Western Europe. Many subsequently became Roman-era towns and cities, whilst others were abandoned. In regions north of the rivers Danube and Rhine, such as most of Germania, where the populations remained independent from Rome, &quot;oppida&quot; continued to be used into the 1st century AD.

==Definition==
 is a Latin word meaning &#x27;defended (fortified) administrative centre or town&#x27;, originally used in reference to non-Roman towns as well as provincial towns under Roman control. The word is derived from the earlier Latin , &#x27;enclosed space&#x27;, possibly from the Proto-Indo-European , &#x27;occupied space&#x27; or &#x27;footprint&#x27;. In modern archaeological usage &quot;oppidum&quot; is a conventional term for large fortified settlements associated with the Celtic La Tène culture.

In his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, Julius Caesar described the larger Celtic Iron Age settlements he encountered in Gaul during the Gallic Wars in 58 to 52 BC as &quot;oppida&quot;. Although he did not explicitly define what features qualified a settlement to be called an &quot;oppidum&quot;, the main requirements emerge. They were important economic sites, places where goods were produced, stored and traded, and sometimes Roman merchants had settled and the Roman legions could obtain supplies. They were also political centres, the seat of authorities who made decisions that affected large numbers of people, such as the appointment of Vercingetorix as head of the Gallic revolt in 52 BC.

Caesar named 28 &quot;oppida&quot;. By 2011, only 21 of these had been positively identified by historians and archaeologists: either there was a traceable similarity between the Latin and the modern name of the locality (e.g. Civitas Aurelianorum-Orléans), or excavations had provided the necessary evidence (e.g. Alesia). Most of the places that Caesar called oppida were city-sized fortified settlements. However, Geneva, for example, was referred to as an &quot;oppidum&quot;, but no fortifications dating to this period have yet been discovered there. Caesar also refers to 20 &quot;oppida&quot; of the Bituriges and 12 of the Helvetii, twice the number of fortified settlements of these groups known today. That implies that Caesar likely counted some unfortified settlements as &quot;oppida&quot;. A similar ambiguity is in evidence in writing by the Roman historian Livy, who also used the word for both fortified and unfortified settlements.

In his work &quot;Geographia&quot;, Ptolemy listed the coordinates of many Celtic settlements. However, research has shown many of the localisations of Ptolemy to be erroneous, making the identification of any modern location with the names he listed highly uncertain and speculative. An exception to that is the &quot;oppidum&quot; of &quot;Brenodurum&quot; at Bern, which was confirmed by an archaeological discovery.

In archaeology and prehistory, the term &quot;oppida&quot; now refers to a category of settlement; it was first used in that sense by Paul Reinecke, Joseph Déchelette and in reference to Bibracte, Manching, and Závist. In particular, Dehn suggested defining an oppidum by four criteria: 
# Size: The settlement has to have a minimum size, defined by Dehn as .
# Topography: Most &quot;oppida&quot; are situated on heights, but some are located on flat areas of land.
# Fortification: The settlement is surrounded by a (ideally uninterrupted) wall, usually consisting of three elements: a facade of stone, a wooden construction and an earthen rampart at the back. Gates are usually pincer gates.
# Chronology: The settlement dates from the late Iron Age: the last two centuries BC.

In current usage, most definitions of &quot;oppida&quot; emphasise the presence of fortifications, so they are different from undefended farms or settlements, and urban characteristics, marking them as separate from hill forts. They are often described as &#x27;the first cities north of the Alps&#x27;, though earlier examples of urbanism in temperate Europe are also known. The 2nd and 1st centuries BC places them in the period known as La Tène. A notional minimum size of has often been suggested, but that is flexible and fortified sites as small as have been described as &quot;oppida&quot;. However, the term is not always rigorously used, and it has been used to refer to any hill fort or circular rampart dating from the La Tène period. One of the effects of the inconsistency in definitions is that it is uncertain how many &quot;oppida&quot; were built.

In European archaeology, the term &quot;oppida&quot; is also used more widely to characterize any fortified prehistoric settlement. For example, significantly older hill-top structures like the one at Glauberg (6th or 5th century BC) have been called &quot;oppida&quot;.

Such wider use of the term is, for example, common in the Iberian archaeology; in the descriptions of the Castro culture it is commonly used to refer to the settlements going back to the 9th century BC. The Spanish word , also used in English, means &#x27;a walled settlement&#x27; or &#x27;hill fort&#x27;, and this word is often used interchangeably with &quot;oppidum&quot; by archaeologists.

==Location and type==

According to pre-historian John Collis, oppida extend as far east as the Hungarian plain where other settlement types take over. Around 200 &quot;oppida&quot; are known today. Central Spain has sites similar to oppida, but while they share features such as size and defensive ramparts the interior was arranged differently. &quot;Oppida&quot; feature a wide variety of internal structures, from continuous rows of dwellings (Bibracte) to more widely spaced individual estates (Manching). Some &quot;oppida&quot; had internal layouts resembling the &quot;insulae&quot; of Roman cities (Variscourt). Little is known, however, about the purpose of any public buildings.

The main features of the oppida are the walls and gates, the spacious layout, and usually a commanding view of the surrounding area. The major difference with earlier structures was their much larger size. Earlier hill forts were mostly just a few hectares in area, whilst &quot;oppida&quot; could encompass several dozen or even hundreds of hectares. They also played a role in displaying the power and wealth of the local inhabitants and as a line of demarcation between the town and the countryside. According to Jane McIntosh, the &quot;impressive ramparts with elaborate gateways ... were probably as much for show and for controlling the movement of people and goods as for defense&quot;. Some of the &quot;oppida&quot; fortifications were built on an immense scale. Construction of the 7km-long &quot;&quot; at Manching required an estimated 6,900 m3 of stones for the façade alone, up to 7.5 tons of iron nails, 90,000 m3 of earth and stones for the fill between the posts and 100,000 m3 of earth for the ramp. In terms of labour, some 2,000 people would have been needed for 250 days. The 5.5km-long of Bibracte may have required 40 to 60 hectares of mature oak woodland to be clear-felled for its construction.

However, size and construction of &quot;oppida&quot; varied considerably. Typically &quot;oppida&quot; in Bohemia and Bavaria were much larger than those found in the north and west of France. Typically &quot;oppida&quot; in Britain are small, but there is a group of large oppida in the south east; though oppida are uncommon in northern Britain, Stanwick stands out as an unusual example as it covers . Dry stone walls supported by a bank of earth, called Kelheim ramparts, were characteristic of oppida in central Europe. To the east, timbers were often used to support the earth and stone ramparts, called &quot;Pfostenschlitzmauer&quot; (post slot wall) or &quot;Preist-type wall&quot;. In western Europe, especially Gaul, the &quot;murus gallicus&quot; (a timber frame nailed together, with a stone facade and earth/stone fill), was the dominant form of rampart construction. Dump ramparts, that is earth unsupported by timber, were common in Britain and were later adopted in France. They have been found in particular in the north-west and central regions of France and were combined with wide moats (&quot;Type Fécamp&quot;). Oppida can be divided into two broad groups, those around the Mediterranean coast and those further inland. The latter group were larger, more varied, and spaced further apart.

In Britain the &quot;oppidum&quot; of &quot;Camulodunon&quot; (modern Colchester, built between the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD), tribal capital of the Trinovantes and at times the Catuvellauni, made use of natural defences enhanced with earthworks to protect itself. The site was protected by two rivers on three of its sides, with the River Colne bounding the site to the north and east, and the Roman River forming the southern boundary; the extensive bank and ditch earthworks topped with palisades were constructed to close off the open western gap between these two river valleys. These earthworks are considered the most extensive of their kind in Britain, and together with the two rivers enclosed the high status farmsteads, burial grounds, religious sites, industrial areas, river port and coin mint of the Trinovantes.

==History==
Prehistoric Europe saw a growing population. According to Jane McIntosh, in about 5,000 BC during the Neolithic between 2 million and 5 million people lived in Europe; in the late (pre-Roman) Iron Age (2nd and 1st centuries BC) it had an estimated population of around 15 to 30 million. Outside Greece and Italy, which were more densely populated, the vast majority of settlements in the Iron Age were small, with perhaps no more than 50 inhabitants. While hill forts could accommodate up to 1,000 people, &quot;oppida&quot; in the late Iron Age could reach as large as 10,000 inhabitants.

&quot;Oppida&quot; originated in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. Most were built on fresh sites, usually on an elevated position. Such a location would have allowed the settlement to dominate nearby trade routes and may also have been important as a symbol of control of the area. For instance at the &quot;oppidum&quot; of Ulaca in Spain the height of the ramparts is not uniform: those overlooking the valley are considerably higher than those facing towards the mountains in the area. The traditional explanation is that the smaller ramparts were unfinished because the region was invaded by the Romans; however, archaeologist John Collis dismisses this explanation because the inhabitants managed to build a second rampart extending the site by to cover an area of . Instead he believes the role of the ramparts as a status symbol may have been more important than their defensive qualities.

While some &quot;oppida&quot; grew from hill forts, by no means all of them had significant defensive functions. The development of &quot;oppida&quot; was a milestone in the urbanisation of the continent as they were among the first large settlements north of the Alps that could genuinely be described as towns or cities (earlier sites include the &#x27;Princely Seats&#x27; of the Hallstatt period). Caesar pointed out that each tribe of Gaul would have several &quot;oppida&quot; but that they were not all of equal importance, implying a form of settlement hierarchy, with some &quot;oppida&quot; serving as regional capitals. This is also reflected in the archaeological evidence. According to Fichtl (2018), in the first century BC Gaul was divided into around sixty (the term used by Caesar) or &#x27;autonomous city-states&#x27;, which were mostly organized around one or more &quot;oppida&quot;. In some cases, &quot;one of these can be regarded effectively as a capital.&quot;

&quot;Oppida&quot; continued in use until the Romans began conquering Iron Age Europe. Even in the lands north of the River Danube that remained unconquered by the Romans, &quot;oppida&quot; were abandoned by the late 1st century AD. In conquered lands, the Romans used the infrastructure of the &quot;oppida&quot; to administer the empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain.

<doc id="652431" wikidata="Q5280582" url="?curid=652431" title="Director telephone system">
<text>The director telephone system was a development of the Strowger or step-by-step (SXS) switching system used in London and five other large cities in the UK from the 1920s to the 1980s.

A large proportion (c. 70% to 80%) of telephone traffic in large metropolitan areas is outgoing traffic, and it is distributed over many exchanges. A non-director SXS exchange system is not suitable for these areas.

As the translation facility incorporated was similar to the register in common control systems, the director system incorporates two features of the Panel system, which was introduced in large American cities, and which were required regardless of the type of exchange system for these large areas, which would have a mixture of manual and automatic exchanges for some years. Customer stations were assigned seven-digit numbers, with the first three digits spelling out the local exchange name; this expedited call handling particularly to and from manual exchanges. Direct or tandem junction routes to other exchanges could be allocated as required, with routing independent of the telephone number and able to be altered at any time to cater for traffic growth or the introduction of new local or tandem exchanges.

Each local exchange incorporated up to eight groups of directors which translated the first three digits (ABC digits) comprising the exchange name into a pulse train of one to six digits, as required for each exchange and unique to that exchange. The translated digits were sent to the code selectors, and then the four numeric digits were sent to three switching stages in the terminating exchange (two group selectors and a final selector). Hence local calls within the exchange and busy direct junction routes to exchanges with high traffic from that exchange could be trunked via one code selection stage, which reduced both the setting-up time and the total number of selectors required in the network. Distant exchanges which did not justify direct junction routes could be called via one or more tandem exchanges; being routed via one, two or three local code selectors in the originating exchange, one or more selectors in the tandem exchange(s), and finally the numeric selection stages in the terminating exchange for the last four digits, which were stored and forwarded without translation.

==Numbering plan==
The telephone numbering plan for the Director System assigned seven-digit telephone numbers to subscriber stations. The first three digits were encoded as the first three letters of the local exchange name. The translation map of letters to digits was displayed directly on the telephone rotary dial, by grouping the letters with the corresponding digits. The British letter arrangement was similar to American dials, except that the letters &quot;O&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; mapped to digit 0, not 6: 1 (unmapped), 2 ABC, 3 DEF, 4 GHI, 5 JKL, 6 MN, 7 PRS, 8 TUV, 9 WXY, 0 OQ. The mapping of O and Q to 0 was to eliminate the possibility of a subscriber misdialling as a result of misreading a number.

A subscriber in Wimbledon, for example, would be assigned the number ; the first three letters, written in capitals, indicated the exchange code to be dialled. The actual trains of pulses from the subscriber&#x27;s dial were 9461234. The exchange code digits dialled by the calling subscriber were the same from any telephone in the London director area, which has a linked numbering scheme. Subscribers on manual exchanges asked for a number in the format , whether the called number was on a manual or automatic exchange.

The three-letter code was written in bold capitals if the caller should dial all seven digits. If written merely in capitals it indicated that the desired number was on an exchange which had not yet been converted to automatic working, and that the caller should dial only the initial three code digits, and wait to be connected by an operator. Later some of the remaining manual exchanges were equipped with Coded-Call Indicators (CCI) which displayed the local digits dialled by the caller to the operator, The number would be listed as for an automatic subscriber with the first three letters in bold, and automatic subscribers would dial all seven digits. If an exchange was outside the Director linked-number area, the exchange name and number was in small type, e.g. Laindon 2263.

In a Director area there were 8 digits available for the A-digit letter of the exchange name (excluding &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot;), and 9 digits each for the B-digit and C-digit letters; hence there were a maximum of 648 exchange names (8 × 9 × 9), though in practice some ABC codes (e.g. 555) did not have a usable name equivalent, and by 1966 London (with 350 exchanges) was running out of exchange names. Special Service numbers apart from &quot;0&quot; for operator used a three-letter exchange name; e.g. TOL (toll), TRU (trunk), DIR (directory enquiries), TIM (time, the &quot;speaking clock&quot;), ENG (engineering i.e. faults), or UMP (for the Test Match cricket scores).

== Equipment ==
To make a call, the subscriber&#x27;s uniselector seizes a free first code selector, which in turn seizes an A-digit selector via an A-digit hunter uniselector. The A-digit selector returns dial tone, steps to the first dialled digit and searches for a free director from that group. The director includes a two-motion selector – the BC switch – which steps vertically and then horizontally according to the two BC digits. This selector has six banks to permit up to six pulse trains to be generated by the director to step the code selectors; the bank contacts are strapped via a translation field to indicate the digit required (or to a DCO lead to indicate that all translation digits have been sent). The pulse train output begins after the C-digit is received from the subscriber&#x27;s telephone. This is generated under the control of the send switch uniselector as it searches for the marks provided by the translation field straps for the exchange code received. Meanwhile, the subscriber has continued to dial and the four digits of the numerical portion of the number are stored on four more uniselectors. These set up four more marks, and after completing the output of the code translation the send switch uniselector searches for them in turn in order to forward the numerical digits unchanged to step the numerical selectors at the terminating exchange.

Calls to manual exchanges (where the caller asks the manual exchange operator for the number) and calls to special service like &quot;0&quot; for operator or &quot;999&quot; for emergencies do not require any numeric digits.

The holding time of the A-digit selector and director will depend on the number (1 to 6) and length of code digits to be sent, and whether numeric digits are also to be sent, but averages 20 seconds. On a call to the operator via digit &quot;0&quot; which has already been received by the A-digit selector and requires no more than four routing digits and no numeric digits, the holding time will be only 2 or 3 seconds. As traffic to the operator via digit &quot;0&quot; is small, this level on the A-digit selector does not have its own group of directors; one or more of the other groups of directors is equipped with the necessary manual board facilities. Seizure of one of these directors via level &quot;0&quot; passes a discrimination signal to it which causes it to pulse out the routing digits to give access to the operator with no further dialling required by the subscriber.

For calls to manual local exchanges with CCI equipment to display the called number to the operator, the equipment required at the manual exchange and the director equipment holding time can be minimised by using storage equipment at the automatic exchange which holds the number information until manual exchange equipment is available.

The A-digit selector, BC switch and particularly the send switch uniselector of the director were worked much harder than selectors in the switching train which were held for the duration of the call, and the noise in the vicinity of director racks in the busy hour could be unbearable. An experimental &quot;all-relay&quot; director (apart from a motor uniselector for the translations) was developed in the 1950s to try to reduce the amount of maintenance the directors needed. Before they were replaced by electronic exchanges, some director exchanges had the director equipment replaced by electronic directors using CMOS technology which controlled the exchange selectors, with economies in space and maintenance.

==Code selectors==
The first code selectors had levels for local exchange calls and calls to the local tandem exchange. An exchange with up to 23 outgoing routes would require a second code selection stage on some calls, and for more outgoing routes (up to 93) some third selection stages. But as a nearby business exchange might have 50 TU (traffic units) in the BH (busy hour), and more distant exchanges might have only 2 or 3 TUs, the busy routes should be on the first code selectors and the least busy routes only via a second and perhaps a third selection stage. Hence for a hypothetical example with 30 outgoing routes, three schemes are possible with (A) three second and no third code selector groups, (B) two second and one third code selector groups, and (C) one second and two third code selector groups. The number of switches for the hypothetical traffic distribution is 348, 302 and 315 switches, i.e. scheme B is the optimum; but each exchange must be calculated individually. The busy routes should also be allocated to the lower levels on the selectors to minimise setting-up time and also the number of operations of the mechanism and hence the wear on them.

Local call metering must be done at the originating exchange, and when local calls were charged by distance it was preferable for the first code selector levels to determine the number of unit fees required. The fee was 1 unit up to , 2 units , 3 units , and 4 units .

== Preparation for director service ==
Before director service could be introduced to any exchange in the network, all subscriber numbers were converted to the 3L-4N format, with any two- or three-digit local numbers (e.g. Tudor 432) expanded to four numeric digits. The exchange names were changed if necessary, as the same network cannot have exchanges called BRIxton and CRIcklewood, which both correspond to 274. As the first digit &quot;0&quot; is used for operator access, an exchange name cannot start with the letters &quot;O&quot; or &quot;Q&quot;. The letter &quot;Z&quot; is not included on the dial, so the first three letters of an exchange name cannot include it.

In smaller director areas outside London some A-digit levels could be combined so that local director exchanges only needed three or four groups of directors instead of eight, with greater efficiency from the larger groups of directors. A hypothetical area with 30 exchanges could be served by three groups of directors serving A-digit levels 2 &amp; 3; 4 &amp; 7, and 5, 6 &amp; 8. But it was not possible to have (say) exchanges called PERivale and TERminus in a director area where levels 7 and 8 were combined, and hence in these smaller areas, requirements for additional exchange names must be considered.

Before a manual exchange was converted to automatic, changes to allocated numbers to facilitate PBX hunting groups were required. In SXS automatic exchanges only some number groups have PBX hunting facility, and within those number groups the main and other numbers in a hunting group have to be in a certain order. If TUDor 2725 (say) was to be the listed (main) number subsequent numbers must be 2726, 2727, 2728 2729 &amp; 2720; and the PBX hunting group on 2725 is limited to a maximum of 6 incoming lines (although the PBX could also have additional outgoing-only lines to the exchange). A PBX group with 10 PBX-hunting lines would commence with 2721 (say) to 2720, and PBX hunting groups requiring more than 10 incoming lines would be served by special 11-and-over PBX final selectors which could search over several (10-line) levels in succession.

In practice to save space 200-outlet final selectors were almost always used in preference to 100-outlet; the selectors switched to the alternate wipers, or not as appropriate, depending on which preceding selector stage seized them. This allowed a PBX group to have up to 20 lines without the need of 11-and-over PBX final selectors. Moreover, if these selectors were used, the PBX group could have up to 200 lines, and the final selectors in the group were arranged so that different selectors searched over the lines in a different order to reduce waiting times for callers.

Any two-party numbers also needed to be served by two-party or shared service equipment. The two subscribers on a two-party line would have separate three-letter then four digit numbers in a special number group, and had selective ringing to the party required only (code ringing with a letter suffix for the code required was not used).

== The London director area ==

In 1927 Holborn (HOLborn), the first director automatic exchange in London, was cutover at midnight on Saturday 12 November. As it was a largely business exchange, most subscribers did not use the new system until Monday 14 November. The changeover was successful, although there were some delays as the subscribers were not familiar with using a dial phone. BIShopgate and SLOane exchanges were to follow in six weeks, followed by WEStern and MONument exchanges. The London area contained 80 exchanges, and full conversion took many years.

Holborn exchange had 9,400 subscribers (lines) and had 222 directors, each of which on average handled 72 calls in the busy hour and be held for 20 seconds. Holborn was also a tandem exchange for calls to and from local manual exchanges, so that the tandem traffic from manual exchanges was combined with traffic from automatic exchanges. Handling local calls between manual exchanges via a third operator at a tandem exchange is uneconomic, but without tandem switching each manual exchange would have required direct junctions to every other manual exchange. In London there were 73 manual exchanges within of Oxford Circus, of which twenty had coded-call indicator equipment which displayed the number dialled to the local manual exchange operator, and the rest were to be equipped shortly.

By 1950 the London director system had 75 exchanges within a radius of Oxford Circus and a further 65 in the belt; and in Greater London i.e. within of Oxford Circus there were 237 exchanges altogether. London had some exchange buildings containing two separate exchanges, as the number of customer lines exceeded 10,000; e.g. CROydon and MUNicipal in Scarbrook Road.

The rotary system had been proposed for London by Bell (Western Electric) engineers, who had developed the panel and rotary systems in the 1900s; manufactured in the United States and Europe respectively. The panel system with large switches was more suitable for a densely populated area like New York, and with outer areas of London having smaller exchanges they had proposed the rotary system (initially to be manufactured in Antwerp) for London. However the director system had the advantage of using equipment items similar to the SXS exchanges being used in smaller British cities and towns, and would be manufactured in Britain from the outset. It was also possible to convert a local SXS exchange to a director exchange.

While a director area had a maximum of 648 exchange names (8 × 9 × 9), in practice some numbers do not have a usable name equivalent; unusable ABC digits would be 688 (MUTt or MUVver?) or 555. London was running out of usable names with 350 exchanges by 1965; this was one reason for the change to all-figure dialling in 1966. This problem was sidestepped to some degree by using otherwise unusable codes to give access to the fringe non-director exchanges from the director area. For example, in London callers to South Mimms were told to dial SM6 followed by the four-digit South Mimms number; callers to Uxbridge numbers were told to dial UX followed by the five-digit Uxbridge number. In this latter case the first digit of the Uxbridge number rotated the BC switch of the director and was absorbed in specifying the translation; the last digit of the translation then regenerated the first digit of the Uxbridge number.

For a list of all the local London exchanges by name in 1968, see.

== Other director cities ==
The director system was introduced in London (1927), and then in Manchester (1930), Birmingham (1931), Glasgow (1937), Liverpool (1941), and Edinburgh (1950). While London initially included all exchanges within of Oxford Circus, other cities initially included all exchanges within radius from the city centre, and was then extended to include larger exchanges within radius from the centre. Generally it was policy to install director equipment where the total number of subscribers was expected to be greater than 60,000 lines within 30 years.

In cities outside London, it was possible to avoid the installation of Coded-Call Indicator (CCI) equipment at manual exchanges by converting to automatic in stages with the issue of a new directory, e.g. converting groups of (say) six exchanges at 12-month intervals; this was done in Liverpool, Birmingham, Glasgow and Edinburgh.

In 1950 Glasgow had 35 exchanges within of the centre of the city, several of two units, and 11 of them were within of the centre.

By the time the director system was superseded in the UK by all-figure dialling from March 1966, London had almost exhausted all possible, usable combinations of letters (it had about 240 at that stage). While this was far from the case in the provincial cities, the crossover to all-figure dialling was still a sizeable operation in Manchester (48 exchange names to convert – including IRLam and MARple), Birmingham (43 exchanges) and Glasgow (42).

==United States==
In the United States, most large cities were served by the Bell System and used the panel switch, or later the Number One Crossbar Switching System (1XB), or the Number 5 Crossbar Switching Systems rather than step-by-step equipment. Los Angeles being a small town early in the 20th century and partly being served by an independent telephone company, grew to be a major exception. Before the advent of electronic switching systems, directors were commonly used in areas of the city served by GTE.

<text>Project A (; fully titled as Jackie Chan&#x27;s Project A) is a 1983 Hong Kong martial arts action comedy film starring and directed by Jackie Chan, who also wrote the screenplay with Edward Tang, who produced with Leonard Ho and Raymond Chow. The film co-stars Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. &quot;Project A&quot; was released theatrically in Hong Kong on December 22, 1983.

The film is also known in West Germany as both Piratpatrullen and Der Superfighter marketed next to Der Superfighter III (&quot;The Fearless Hyena&quot;) and Der Superfighter II (&quot;Fearless Hyena Part II&quot;). The Philippines also released the film under the title Superfly 2 and marketed it next to Superfly (&quot;Armour of God II&quot;).

Set in the 19th century in old Hong Kong, &quot;Project A&quot; blends martial arts with comedy moments and spectacular stunts. One stunt in particular involved Chan hanging and falling from the hand of a clock tower some high, tearing through awning canopies before hitting the ground, a stunt he performed three times as he was unhappy with the first two.

The film was a box office success in East Asia. At the 4th Hong Kong Film Awards, Chan received two nominations for the film (and another for &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot;), including his first Best Actor nomination, and won his first Best Action Choreography award. A sequel, &quot;Project A Part II&quot;, was released in 1987.

==Plot==
In the late 19th century, Sergeant Dragon Ma is part of the Hong Kong Marine Police&#x27;s effort to combat pirates, who have been raiding ships for months. Members of the Hong Kong Police Force and the Marine Police, who have strong inter-service rivalries, get into a fight in a bar. Shortly after this, Captain Chi releases all of the sailors to their commanding officer, and two of the Marine Police&#x27;s ships get blown up.

Gangsters Chiang and Mr. Chou meet at a VIP Club and discuss fleeing to Vietnam. As soon as Chiang leaves, he meets one of the pirates and they laugh about sabotaging the Marine Police ships. The pirate tells Chiang that his boss, San Pao wants 100 police rifles.

Dragon Ma and his squad are forced to become regular police officers. They have to undergo &quot;hard training&quot; with the police under Captain Chi&#x27;s nephew, Hong Tin-tsu. After the police learn that Chiang is at the VIP Club, and that the guests there are not to be disturbed, Dragon and Tin-tsu go to arrest Chiang. A big fight breaks out. Tiring of the blatant corruption in the police force, Dragon arrests Chiang out and tells Tin-tsu to take the credit. That is his last official act as an officer with the Hong Kong police.

Fei finds Dragon in the street. They have a conversation and Fei reveals that someone in the police force is selling rifles. Fei tells Dragon that all he wants are the guns, and Dragon can catch the traitor. At night, Dragon and Fei interrupt a gun deal between the Army and the police Captain. After pushing everyone into the water and making off with the guns, Fei hides the rifles inside a log and marks it with a red flag. He later tries to sell the guns to the gangsters and pirates, but Dragon has removed Fei&#x27;s red flag and put flags on other logs instead.

Having thwarted Fei&#x27;s plan to sell the rifles to the pirates, Dragon has a conversation with the Admiral&#x27;s daughter, Winnie. He learns that the Captain wasn&#x27;t smuggling rifles for San pao, he was buying the rifles from the army to arm his men. Overhearing this, Fei gets into an argument with Dragon. The gangsters come after Fei, and he tells them that Dragon is to blame for the missing rifles. Dragon is forced to flee with Winnie. After teaming up with Fei, being tortured for information about the rifles, and falling from the face of a clock tower, Dragon is tracked down by the police for a for a third time, and they help him get away as they arrest the gangsters.

Having lost the rifles, the pirates take a ship hostage, the passengers including a Rear Admiral. Mr. Chou proposes an arms-for-hostages deal and the Colonel consents. Having overheard the conversation, Dragon confronts the Colonel and convinces him that the gangsters and the pirates will never fear the law if the police force are corrupt. It is agreed that Dragon will assume all responsibility for the mission to save the hostages, and the Colonel allows the Marine Police to be brought back into full force.

Mr. Chou is brought in by the police and beaten until he tells Dragon and Tin-tsu how to get to San Pao. Dragon, posing as Mr. Chou, gets on board a ship that takes him to San Pao&#x27;s hideout, and they are followed by the rest of the squad. Fei sneaks aboard and poses as a pirate. After a lot of tricky undercover work, the cavalry arrives, and there is a final confrontation in the middle of the pirate&#x27;s lair. Dragon, Tin-tsu, and Fei engage in a hand-to-hand battle with San Pao, eventually killing him with a hand grenade when he&#x27;s rolled into the carpet. After the battle, they sail a raft to take the hostages back to Hong Kong.

==Cast==
Isabella Wong is the only female actress with a substantial role in this film. She has film credits for cameo appearances in the sequel &quot;Project A Part II&quot; and in &quot;Police Story 2&quot;.

===Title===
In the 1980s, Chan chose vague, generic film titles such as &quot;Project A&quot; and &quot;Police Story&quot; so as not to give the plots of the films away prior to their release. It was felt that the titles of previous Chan films such as &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; and &quot;Drunken Master&quot; gave too much away about the kung fu style they featured (Snake Style and Drunken Fist respectively). &quot;Project A&quot; was originally going to be titled &quot;Pirate Patrol&quot;, but it was feared that once announced, other Hong Kong film producers would rush to copy and release films featuring pirates.

==Production==

On the audio commentary of the Hong Kong Legends (Region 2) DVD, Bey Logan reveals that Chan&#x27;s last period film, &quot;Dragon Lord&quot; (1982), had under-performed at the Hong Kong box office in comparison to the previous one, &quot;The Young Master&quot; (1980). Logan identifies that a possible reason for the poor performance was the comparative lack of action. Edward Tang and the production team felt that a period film could still have success if it had sufficient action, and so researched the history of Hong Kong during the time of pirates for &quot;Project A&quot;.

Unlike other Hollywood period films that are set on an exact time and place, many Hong Kong films play fast and loose with their period in history. A prominent example by Bey Logan is set like this: the Hong Kong Marine Police is set up in 1846 by the British Colonial Government. The Hong Kong Headquarters is set up in 1884. The Kowloon Canton Railway Clock tower is set up in 1915. In other words, this film takes place between the 19th and early 20th century. Jackie and the Golden Harvest team employ some researchers to come up with background for this story about pirates in Hong Kong and are not really concerned at all about depicting the film in the exact era.

&quot;Project A&quot; marks the first time that veteran Michael Lai used orchestral music for a film score, instead of using library music or lifting the score from other films.

In rehearsal for the clock tower fall, Chan took a week to build the courage to drop from such a great height. During the shooting of the bicycle chase sequence, one of the stuntmen informed Chan that &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; was playing at the local cinema. Chan halted filming to watch the bicycle chase scene in the finale of &quot;E.T.&quot;, to ensure that his scene and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s scene were not the same. After watching the film, Chan became more confident, realizing that the audience doesn&#x27;t really care so much about such minor details, only in watching the film and having a good time. According to his book &quot;I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action&quot;, Chan injured his neck while filming the scene.

After appearing in &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981), Chan liked the idea of including bloopers over the closing credits. Beginning with &quot;Dragon Lord&quot;, he has included (and directed) outtakes over the end credits for most of his films, including &quot;Project A&quot;, and they have become something of a Chan trademark. Due to the nature of his films, Chan&#x27;s outtakes are a combination of comedic moments and injuries sustained whilst he and his team perform stunts and fight sequences. These outtakes were enjoyed particularly by audiences in Japan—so much so that Japanese film companies would demand the inclusion of &quot;NGs&quot; (&quot;no good&quot; shots) in the distribution contracts for all Jackie Chan films, regardless of director.

While some of Chan&#x27;s comedy stunt work in &quot;Project A&quot; has similarities to the comedy stunt work of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, Chan had not seen their films at the time, as they were not available on home video. According to Chan, &quot;Project A&quot; was an evolution of the action stunt work he had already been doing in earlier kung fu comedy films since &quot;The Young Master&quot; (1980). He only became aware of Keaton later from Western critics who watched &quot;Project A&quot; and drew comparisons, after which Chan watched Keaton&#x27;s films when they eventually became available on home video and realized how similar Keaton is to himself.

==Release==
&quot;Project A&quot; was released in Hong Kong on 22 December 1983. In the Philippines, the film was originally released as &quot;Mark of the Dragon&quot;, but First Films later rereleased it as &quot;Superfly 2&quot; on 17 September 1992, connecting it to the unrelated film &quot;Armour of God II: Operation Condor&quot; (released as &quot;Superfly&quot;).

===Box office===
&quot;Project A&quot; (along with &quot;Dragon Lord&quot;) marked Chan&#x27;s return to Asian cinema after his first attempt to break into the Hollywood market with a small role in &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; and a starring role in the commercially disappointing &quot;Battle Creek Brawl&quot;. In contrast, &quot;Project A&quot; was a huge success at the Hong Kong box office, earning HK$19,323,824 ().

It was also very well received abroad, and particularly throughout East Asia. Reportedly, in Japan, Emperor Showa&#x27;s fondness of the film and eagerness to see a sequel led Chan to make &quot;Project A Part II&quot;. At the Japan box office, &quot;Project A&quot; grossed (), becoming one of the top three highest-grossing foreign films of 1984 (along with another Jackie Chan starrer &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;) and the year&#x27;s sixth highest-grossing film overall.

In Taiwan, it was one of the top five highest-grossing films of 1984, with 369,914 admissions grossing (US$611,777). In South Korea, it was the highest-grossing film of 1984 with 396,436 ticket sales, grossing an estimated (). In France, the film sold 200,498 tickets in 1988, equivalent to an estimated (). Combined, the film grossed an estimated total of approximately in Asia and Europe.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Project A&quot; was met with positive reviews. In his annual film guide, &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot;, Maltin rated the film 3 out of 4 stars. The film was praised by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

The film has an 77% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 13 reviews.

<text>The Estonian National Council in Sweden was established in 1947 and was one of the oldest and largest Estonian central organisations in Sweden. The Estonian National Council was a broad coalition of Estonian political parties in exile, which maintained close contacts with Swedish democratic political parties. The main task of the ENC had been preservation and development of Estonian national and cultural heritage in exile. The ENC consisted of prominent Estonian personalities and supporters of various nationalities, 9000 people in total.

The representatives of the ENC had participated in 1000 international conferences, working for breaking the westward advance of communist totalitarianism and preserving Estonian national identity in anticipation of the time when Estonia would be again free nation which occurred after the collapse of Soviet Union.

<text>Armour of God ( ) is a 1986 Hong Kong action adventure comedy film starring and directed by Jackie Chan, and written by Chan, John Sheppard and Eric Tsang (who also co-directed). It co-stars Alan Tam, Lola Forner, and Rosamund Kwan.

The film combines Chan&#x27;s martial arts, comedy and stunts with an &quot;Indiana Jones-&quot;style adventure film theme. It is deemed a cult classic. Chan came the closest he had ever been to death in this film during a relatively routine stunt; he leaped onto a tree from a ledge, but the branch he grabbed snapped, sending Chan plummeting and cracking his skull.

The film was the highest-grossing film in Hong Kong at the time, grossing an estimated at the box office in Asia and Europe. It was followed by the sequels &quot;Armour of God II: Operation Condor&quot; in 1991, and &quot;CZ12&quot; in 2012.

==Plot==
Jackie, a.k.a. &quot;Asian Hawk&quot;, is a former musician who becomes an adventurer and treasure hunter. After successfully stealing a sword from an African tribe, he has the weapon auctioned before it is won by May Bannon, the beautiful daughter of Count Bannon.

Jackie is reunited with his former bandmate Alan, who seeks his help as his girlfriend Lorelei has been kidnapped by an evil religious cult as a means of acquiring Jackie&#x27;s services. The cult possesses two pieces of a legendary armour called the &quot;Armour of God&quot;, and they intend to have Jackie bring them the three remaining armour pieces, including the sword. Jackie and Alan strike a deal with Count Bannon, who is in possession of the three armour pieces: they will borrow the armour pieces for their quest to rescue Lorelei with a promise to complete the armour for the Count, on the condition that May accompanies them.

Jackie, Alan and May travel into Yugoslavia to find the cult&#x27;s monastery. They infiltrate the hideout and secretly rescue Lorelei, unaware that the cult leaders have anticipated their arrival and brainwashed her to do their bidding. At May&#x27;s rest home, Lorelei drugs Alan and has him steal the three armour pieces. Jackie sneaks back to the monastery and rescues his friends. As Alan and Lorelei make their escape, Jackie fends off against the cult members before discovering the Armour of God in a cave. Before he gets a chance to take the armour, he encounters the Grand Wizard, who unleashes his four female assassins on the adventurer. Exploiting their high-heeled shoes as their weakness, Jackie defeats the assassins in a gruelling fight.

Jackie is then surrounded by the rest of the Grand Wizard&#x27;s men, but he reveals a vest filled with sticks of dynamite under his jacket, threatening to blow himself up with the monastery. After a couple of bluffs, he accidentally lights up all the dynamite fuses. Discarding the explosives, he runs for his life as the detonations cave in the monastery, burying the entire cult and the Armour of God. He runs out of a cave and spots a hot-air balloon with Alan, Lorelei, and May aboard. In a daring move, Jackie does a base jump off the cave and lands on top of the balloon, ending the movie.

==Cast==
* Jackie Chan as Jackie a.k.a. &quot;Asian Hawk&quot;, a common treasure hunter and former member of the pop group &quot;The Losers&quot; (an allusion to 1970s Cantopop band The Wynners)
* Alan Tam as Alan, a former member of The Losers who has moved on to a successful solo career
* Lola Forner as May Bannon, the daughter of a powerful European Count
* Rosamund Kwan as Lorelei, Alan&#x27;s girlfriend and a former member of the Losers who is a prominent fashion designer
* Božidar Smiljanić as Count Bannon, May&#x27;s father

* Anthony Chan

==Production==
&quot;Armour of God&quot; was filmed on location in parts of what was then Yugoslavia: Zagreb (Dolac Central Market), Upper town, Trnje (near the then-unfinished building of Croatian Radio Television), Croatia, narrow corridors and the main gate of Motovun castle and Predjama Castle near Postojna, Slovenia. Filming was also undertaken in Graz, Austria, France, Spain and Morocco. During filming of the opening sequence, one scene called for Jackie Chan to jump from a wall to a tree branch. The first take went as planned, but Chan insisted on re-shooting the scene. On his second attempt, the branch broke, and he fell 5 metres to the ground below. His head hit a rock, cracking his skull and forcing a piece of bone up into his brain. Chan was flown to the hospital and was in surgery eight hours later. As a result, he now has a permanent hole in his head filled with a plastic plug and slight hearing loss in his right ear. Actor Eric Tsang filled in as director following the accident. Footage of the accident is shown during the film&#x27;s ending credits.

While shooting the hot-air balloon jump, Chan skydived out of a plane and landed on top of the balloon instead of jumping off a cliff as is seen in the film. For the shot of him jumping off the cliff, the crew rigged him up to a wire as he had no experience of BASE jumping.

Cynthia Rothrock was originally auditioned for the role of Amazon Fighter in the film. However, Rothrock turned down the role due to Chan&#x27;s injury halting production of the film, before Rothrock was re-assigned to play as the lead actress in Yuen Biao&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Righting Wrongs&quot;. Rothrock was replaced by Marcia Chisholm.

==Release==
&quot;Armour of God&quot; was released in Japan on 16 August 1986. The film was released in Hong Kong on 21 January 1987.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film received positive reviews, with an approval rating of 70% on Rotten Tomatoes based on ten reviews.

In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. &quot;Armour of God&quot; was listed at 81st place on this list.

==Versions==
In Asia, some versions of the film had Alan Tam&#x27;s song &quot;Lorelei&quot; playing during the end credits, whereas others had Jackie Chan singing &quot;Flight of the Dragon (aka High upon High)&quot;. Tam and Chan recorded both songs in Cantonese and English and their English versions were featured in the export English dubs.

In the United States, &quot;Armour of God&quot; did not receive a theatrical release. The film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Armour of God II: Operation Condor&quot; (1991), was released under the simplified title &quot;Operation Condor&quot;. &quot;Armour of God&quot; was subsequently released direct-to-video by Miramax Films, but the title was changed to &quot;Operation Condor 2: The Armor of the Gods&quot;; at the time of its release it served as a prequel, despite being the first film. A new musical score was created for this release, and a new English dub (with the participation of Chan).

Nine minutes of cuts were made to the Miramax version, including:
* The concert scene of Jackie&#x27;s band The Losers.
* Jackie&#x27;s dream sequence.
* The scene in which May, disguised as a prostitute, encounters a monk who wants to sleep with her.
* An extended version of the slapstick sequence in which Alan hides in May&#x27;s room. The scene also includes a brainwashed Lorelei attempting to seduce Jackie.

These same cuts were evident in the Spanish Region 2 release; however, DVD releases in Hong Kong, Australia and the rest of Europe are uncut.

==Awards and nominations==

<doc id="652442" wikidata="Q877551" url="?curid=652442" title="FOB (shipping)">
<text>FOB (free on board) is a term in international commercial law specifying at what point respective obligations, costs, and risk involved in the delivery of goods shift from the seller to the buyer under the Incoterms standard published by the International Chamber of Commerce. FOB is only used in non-containerized sea freight or inland waterway transport. As with all Incoterms, FOB does not define the point at which ownership of the goods is transferred.

The term FOB is also used in modern domestic shipping within North America to describe the point at which a seller is no longer responsible for shipping costs.

Ownership of a cargo is independent of Incoterms, which relate to delivery and risk. In international trade, ownership of the cargo is defined by the contract of sale and the bill of lading or waybill.

==Historical usage==
The term &quot;free on board&quot;, or &quot;f.o.b.&quot; was used historically in relation to the transfer of risk from seller to buyer as goods are shipped. There appears to have been an assumption that property and risk would pass from the seller to the buyer at the same time. In the case of &quot;Browne v Hare&quot;, settled in the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1858, it was noted that a shipper&#x27;s attempt to reserve title after shipment would have constituted a breach of the contract&#x27;s f.o.b. terms:Later cases such as &quot;Mirabita v Ottoman Imperial Bank&quot; allowed that a contract could make the transfer of property subject to payment, so long as the intention behind this reservation was to secure payment and not to prevent transfer of possession.

==Incoterms==

Under the Incoterms 2020 standard published by the International Chamber of Commerce, FOB is only used in sea freight and stands for &quot;Free On Board&quot;. The term is always used in conjunction with a port of loading. Destination need not be specified and may be left &quot;free&quot;.

Indicating &quot;FOB &quot;port&quot; means that the seller pays for transportation of the goods to the port of shipment, plus loading costs. The buyer pays the cost of marine freight transport, insurance, unloading, and transportation from the arrival port to the final destination. The passing of risks occurs when the goods are loaded on board at the port of shipment. For example, &quot;FOB Vancouver&quot; indicates that the seller will pay for transportation of the goods to the port of Vancouver, and the cost of loading the goods on to the cargo ship (this includes inland haulage, customs clearance, origin documentation charges, demurrage if any, origin port handling charges, in this case Vancouver). The buyer pays for all costs beyond that point, including unloading. Responsibility for the goods is with the seller until the goods are loaded on board the ship. Once the cargo is on board, the buyer assumes the risk.
The use of &quot;FOB&quot; originated in the days of sailing ships. When the ICC first wrote their guidelines for the use of the term in 1936, the ship&#x27;s rail was still relevant, as goods were often passed over the rail by hand. In 1954, in the case of &quot;Pyrene Co. Ltd. v. Scindia Steam Navigation Co. Ltd.&quot;, Justice Devlin, ruling on a matter relating to liability under an FOB contract, described the situation thus:

In the modern era of containerization, the term &quot;ship&#x27;s rail&quot; is somewhat archaic for trade purposes, as with a sealed shipping container, there is no way of establishing when damage occurred after the container has been sealed. The standards have noted this. Incoterms 1990 stated,

Incoterms 2000 adopted the wording,

The phrase &quot;passing the ship&#x27;s rail&quot; is no longer in use, having been dropped from the FOB Incoterm in the 2010 revision.

Due to potential confusion with domestic North American usage of &quot;FOB&quot;, it is recommended that the use of Incoterms be explicitly specified, along with the edition of the standard. For example, &quot;FOB New York (Incoterms 2000)&quot;. Incoterms apply to both international trade and domestic trade, as of the 2010 revision.

==North America==
In North America, FOB is written into a sales agreement to determine where the liability responsibility for the goods transfers from the seller to the buyer. FOB stands for &quot;Free On Board&quot;. There is no line item payment by the buyer for the cost of getting the goods onto the transport. There are two possibilities: &quot;FOB origin&quot;, or &quot;FOB destination&quot;. &quot;FOB origin&quot; means the transfer occurs as soon as the goods are safely on board the transport. &quot;FOB destination&quot; means the transfer occurs the moment the goods are removed from the transport at the destination. &quot;FOB origin&quot; (also sometimes phrased as &quot;FOB shipping&quot; or &quot;FOB shipping point&quot;) indicates that the sale is considered complete at the seller&#x27;s shipping dock, and thus the buyer of the goods is responsible for freight costs and liability during transport. With &quot;FOB destination&quot;, the sale is complete at the buyer&#x27;s doorstep and the seller is responsible for freight costs and liability during transport.

The two terms have a specific meaning in commercial law and cannot be altered. But the FOB terms do not need to be used, and often are not. In this case the specific terms of the agreement can vary widely, in particular which party, buyer or seller, pays for the loading costs and shipment costs, and/or where responsibility for the goods is transferred. The last distinction is important for determining liability or risk of loss for goods lost or damaged in transit from the seller to the buyer.

For example, a person in Miami purchasing equipment from a manufacturer in Chicago could receive a price quote of &quot;$5000 FOB Chicago&quot;, which would indicate that the buyer would be responsible for the shipping from Chicago to Miami. If the same seller issued a price quote of &quot;$5000 FOB Miami&quot;, then the seller would cover shipping to the buyer&#x27;s location.

International shipments typically use &quot;FOB&quot; as defined by the Incoterms standards, where it always stands for &quot;Free On Board&quot;. Domestic shipments within the United States or Canada often use a different meaning, specific to North America, which is inconsistent with the Incoterms standards.

North American FOB usage corresponds to Incoterms approximately as follows:
A related but separate term &quot;CAP&quot; (&quot;customer-arranged pickup&quot;) is used to denote that the buyer will arrange a carrier of their choice to pick the goods up at the seller&#x27;s premises, and the liability for any damage or loss belongs to the buyer.

Although FOB has long been stated as &quot;Freight On Board&quot; in sales contract terminology, this should be avoided as it does not precisely conform to the meaning of the acronym as specified in the UCC.

Sometimes FOB is used in sales to retain commission by the outside sales representative. It is unclear where this originated.

== Accounting and auditing ==
In the past, the FOB point determined when title transferred for goods. For example, at year- and period-end goods in transit under &quot;FOB destination&quot; (North American usage) appear on the seller&#x27;s balance sheet but not in the buyer&#x27;s balance sheet, as the risk and rewards of ownership change to the buyer at the &quot;destination&quot; port.

It is much easier to determine when title transfers by referring to the agreed upon terms and conditions of the transaction; typically, title passes with risk of loss. The transfer of title may occur at a different time (or event) than the FOB shipping term. The transfer of title is the element of revenue that determines who owns the goods and the applicable value.

Import fees when they reach the border of one country to enter the other country under the conditions of FOB destination are due at the customs port of the destination country.

With the advent of e-commerce, most commercial electronic transactions occur under the terms of &quot;FOB shipping point&quot; or &quot;FCA shipping point&quot;.

== &quot;Freight On Board&quot; ==
Some sources claim that FOB stands for &quot;Freight On Board&quot;. This is not the case. The term &quot;Freight On Board&quot; is not mentioned in any version of Incoterms, and is not defined by the Uniform Commercial Code in the USA. Further to that, it has been found in the US court system that &quot;Freight On Board&quot; is not a recognized industry term. Use of the term &quot;Freight On Board&quot; in contracts is therefore very likely to cause confusion.

<text>Cookie is a cooking-themed shoot &#x27;em up developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game that was released exclusively for the ZX Spectrum in 1983. In the game, Charlie the Chef has to bake a cake, however his five ingredients are sentient and attempt to escape his pantry, enabling his quest to re-capture them. The game was written by Chris Stamper with graphics by Tim Stamper. It received mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the graphics, but criticising the hard difficulty and its similarities to &quot;Pssst&quot;.

The game was released as Crazy Kitchen in Italian markets and as Chef, Lo in Croatia.

==Gameplay==
The game is presented from a 2D perspective, and the main objective involves Charlie the Chef baking a cake from evil, sentient ingredients. The five ingredients vary from Mixed Peel, Chunky Chocolate, Crafty Cheese, Sneaky Sugar and Colonel Custard, who will all jump out of the pantry and try to avoid the player whenever possible.

The player starts the game with three lives. Several ingredients will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player&#x27;s objective is to put the ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level. 

The game is complicated by the presence of a dustbin monster (similar to Oscar the Grouch) who regularly sticks his head out of one or the other of the dustbins and then flings an item of trash into the playfield. These will deduct a life from Charlie if they touch him, but can be knocked away with flour sacks in the same way that the ingredients can be, or they can be directed back into one of the dustbins. If a trash item enters the cooking bowl it will spoil the taste, and more ingredients will be required to be pushed into the bowl in order to fix this problem and complete the level.

When the right amount of ingredients has been put in the bowl, a cake is baked and a new level begins.

==Development==
A version was also created for the BBC Micro and was scheduled for release in 1984; however, it was never commercially released.

&quot;Cookie&quot; was one of the few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing &quot;instantaneous&quot; loading of the game (the normal method of cassette loading could take several minutes).

==Reception==
Matthew Uffindell of &quot;Crash&quot; praised the game overall, despite thinking it was overshadowed by Ultimate&#x27;s &quot;Tranz Am&quot;, which was bundled with &quot;Cookie&quot; during its initial release. Uffindell stated the gameplay was addictive and challenging, despite thinking it was similar to its predecessor, &quot;Pssst&quot;. Lloyd Mangram of &quot;Crash&quot; considered the game to be overlooked and underrated, despite him suggesting that it was the most difficult of all games developed by Ultimate. Mangram praised the graphics as detailed, fast and &quot;amusing&quot;, owing to the game&#x27;s sentient ingredients. Reviewers of &quot;Home Computing Weekly&quot; similarly praised the graphics and sound, stating that they &quot;are well up to Ultimate&#x27;s standards&quot;.

A reviewer from &quot;Sinclair User&quot; stated that the graphics were of &quot;arcade and cartoon&quot; quality, and criticised the game&#x27;s concept, suggesting that the player would lose interest after completing a few levels. Mangham, however, praised its playability, heralding that it was &quot;great fun&quot; to play and easy to adapt to. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; opined that first impressions of the game were important to the customer, and stated that the player may feel cheated due to the game&#x27;s similarities to &quot;Pssst&quot;.

<doc id="652454" wikidata="Q705518" url="?curid=652454" title="Art Eggleton">
<text>Arthur C. Eggleton (born September 29, 1943) is a retired Canadian politician who served as the 59th and longest-serving mayor of Toronto from 1980 to 1991. He was elected to Parliament in 1993, running as a Liberal in York Centre and served as a member of Parliament (MP) until 2004 when he declined to seek re-election. Eggleton held a number of cabinet positions from 1993 to 2002 including Treasury Board president, minister of infrastructure, minister of international trade, and minister of national defence. He was appointed to the Senate in 2005, serving until he reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 in 2018.

== City council ==
Eggleton, an accountant by profession, was first elected to Toronto City Council in the 1969 municipal election as the junior alderman for Ward 4. He served as budget chief in the council elected in 1973 under David Crombie. He was the Liberal Party candidate in the October 16, 1978, federal by-election held in Toronto&#x27;s west-end Parkdale electoral district in which he was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Yuri Shymko. He ran for re-election to Toronto City Council in Ward 4. finishing first in a field of 10 candidates to become Ward 4&#x27;s senior alderman on council (at the time, two alderman were elected from each ward).

==Mayor of Toronto==
Eggleton was a member of Toronto City Council and the Metropolitan Toronto Council for 22 years. He was Mayor of Toronto from 1980 to 1991, when he retired from municipal politics as the longest-serving mayor in Toronto history.

In 1980, he was elected Mayor of Toronto, defeating incumbent John Sewell. The city moved forward on implementing its new official plan, which resulted in several new significant buildings in the downtown west, or the railway lands area, including the Convention Centre, the SkyDome, and the CBC Broadcast Centre. During Eggleton&#x27;s time as mayor, he prioritized social and economic development, and the City of Toronto produced a record level of social housing projects for low-income people; of new parks; and innovative new responses to the problems of the homeless and emotionally-troubled with projects like Street City, the Singles Housing Opportunities Program, and the Gernsteins Centre.

As Canada&#x27;s economic centre moved from Montreal to Toronto in response to the then-separatist government of Quebec, Toronto saw a significant increase in economic growth during his time as Mayor, with steadily decreasing unemployment through the 1980s and into the early 1990s.

Eggleton established the Mayor&#x27;s Committee on Community and Race Relations to help bring about the successful integration of people from different cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds.

Eggleton supported the expansion and improvement of Toronto&#x27;s parks and green spaces, including the creation of new parks and the development of existing ones. In 1984, Eggleton assisted the Minister of Environment in opening the Martin Goodman Trail, named for the president and editor-in-chief of the Toronto Star, who died three years previously.

In the 1980s Mayor Eggleton was instrumental in the creation of &quot;FoodShare&quot;, an organization that advocates for the right to food, in a bid to prevent dependence on food charity from becoming embedded in the city. In June 2018 Eggleton introduced a bill to the Senate to create Canada&#x27;s first National Food Program, which received support from the Government of Canada in 2019.

During his tenure as mayor, Eggleton faced criticism for steps he took in addressing the concerns of Torontonians in the LGBTQ community. After Operation Soap in 1981, where there were mass arrests of men in the city&#x27;s gay bathhouses, despite stating he had no foreknowledge that the raids would take place, Eggleton and Toronto City Council commissioned law student and journalist Arnold Bruner to conduct an inquiry into the relationship between the gay community and the police. Bruner&#x27;s report O&quot;ut of the Closet: Study of Relations Between Homosexual Community and Police,&quot; was released in 1981. It recognized the gay community as a legitimate community and called for a permanent dialogue between the LGBTQ community and the Toronto Police. The report contained 16 recommendations, although many were only implemented decades later.  

In Eggleton&#x27;s first term as mayor, Pride Toronto was created partly as a response to Operation Soap. During this time, Eggleton faced some criticism for choosing not to designate a recognized City of Toronto day for the Pride Parade, and not attending Pride Parades. In 1990, Toronto Pride organizers filed a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission after Eggleton did not officially declare the day. Eggleton later acknowledged these concerns and stated that &quot;I did not at the time see the parade as being the usual kind of event for a mayor’s declaration&quot;, that he had &quot;come to see it differently and in more recent times…participated in the parade. I see it as part of celebrating an inclusionary society and the contributions of the LGBTQ community in Toronto&quot;. 

As mayor, Eggleton appeared before a committee of the provincial legislature advocating for an amendment to the Human Rights Code to include sexual orientation in the anti-discrimination clause. Eggleton also voted in favour of Bill C-38 also known as the Civil Marriage Act which legalized same-sex marriage in Canada.

Eggleton&#x27;s only serious re-election challenge occurred at the 1985 Toronto municipal election when city councillor Anne Johnston, a fellow Liberal, ran against Eggleton for the mayoralty. Eggleton won by a significant margin, receiving 92,994 votes to Johnston&#x27;s 59,817.

In recognition of his service to the city, Eggleton received Toronto&#x27;s highest honour, the Civic Award of Merit in 1992.

==Member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister==

Eggleton ran in the 1993 election in the suburban Toronto riding of York Centre, again as a Liberal, and won election. He was appointed to the position of President of the Treasury Board and Minister for Infrastructure in the new cabinet.

From January 1996 to June 1997, he served as Minister for International Trade. Eggleton retained his seat in the 1997 election, and was appointed Minister of National Defence. In 1999, Eggleton supported Canada&#x27;s involvement in NATO&#x27;s campaign in Kosovo.

He was re-elected again in the 2000 election, and continued as Minister of Defence, focusing on sweeping changes to the National Defence Act which implemented changes to the military justice system, including the set up of several oversight entities including the nation&#x27;s first ever Military Ombudsman and a Military Police Complaints Commission. These entities would provide another level of conflict resolution for military members and civilian employees. He also improved compensation and benefits for Canadian Forces personnel and their families dedicating roughly $700 million in funding to provide housing and pay under the quality of life program. In November 1999, Eggleton established a new ministerial advisory board focused on gender integration and employment equity in the Canadian Armed Forces.

During his tenure, Canada continued to contribute to international peacekeeping ventures in the Balkans, the Central African Republic, and the Persian Gulf. Eggleton led Canadian participation in the NATO intervention in Kosovo pushing Serbian troops out of the region. Eggleton at the time defended Canadian participation in the NATO air campaign stating he was convinced it was the right thing to do, citing the effects of the Serb military assault, and the mass graves containing the bodies of ethnic Albanians. Eggleton toured Canadian peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Kosovo and the Central African Republic.

The Canadian Forces Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) was also deployed to Honduras for the first time to aid Hurricane Mitch relief efforts. In addition to peacekeeping, Eggleton continued Canadian participation within the United Nations, NORAD and NATO.

Eggleton pushed for increased procurement of equipment and the continued modernization of the Canadian Armed Forces during his time as Minister for National Defence.

In January 2002, Chrétien and Eggleton were accused of misleading Parliament. Both Chrétien and Eggleton when asked in Question Period if Canadian troops had handed over captured Taliban and al-Qaeda members in Afghanistan to the American forces amid concerns about the treatment of POWs at Guantanamo Bay, replied that was in Chrétien&#x27;s words only a &quot;hypothetical question&quot; and that the Canadians had taken no POWs. Critics of the government such as Joe Clark then proceeded to point out that in the previous week, the Toronto newspaper the &quot;Globe &amp; Mail&quot; had run on its frontpage a photo of Canadian soldiers turning over POWs to American troops. Eggleton maintained that he and the rest of the Cabinet had been kept unaware that the Canadian Forces were taking POWs in Afghanistan and turning them over to the Americans, claiming that he had only learned of the policy of handing over POWs several days after the photo had appeared in the &quot;Globe &amp; Mail&quot;.

Eggleton stepped down from cabinet in May 2002, amid allegations of a breach of cabinet minister conflict guidelines by hiring a former girlfriend for a research contract and after ethics counsellor, Howard Wilson, concluded Eggleton breached conflict guidelines for cabinet ministers. Conservative Leader Joe Clark criticized Jean Chrétien&#x27;s decision to move Eggleton to the backbenches, citing similar accusations towards another Liberal MP Don Boudria and their continued membership in Chrétien&#x27;s cabinet. Stephen Harper also criticized Chrétien&#x27;s decision stating &quot;He&#x27;s sending the message that he defends his friends, and he sticks by his own positions.&quot; This happened during the growing leadership turmoil between Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin, who left the cabinet the following week in disputed circumstances. Increased scrutiny on Chrétien&#x27;s government and cabinet may have contributed to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien pressuring him to resign.

Eggleton then became a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade. On May 13, 2004, Eggleton announced he would not be a candidate in the 2004 federal election, making way for the nomination of Ken Dryden as the Liberal candidate in York Centre.

==Senator for Ontario==
He was appointed to the Senate by Paul Martin on March 24, 2005. He served as both chair and Deputy Chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science, and Technology for 12 years in which his focus was on social justice and health care issues. He served on the Bureau of Liberal International, representing the Liberal Party of Canada, as a vice-president for two years and treasurer for one year. He was co-opted to the Bureau of Liberal International as a vice president at the 185th Executive Committee in Cape Town, South Africa in November 2010. Art Eggleton also served on the Senate Modernization Committee, and at different times on the National Finance, Transportation and Communications committees.

On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Eggleton, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents. The Senators will refer to themselves as the Senate Liberal Caucus even though they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.

Eggleton&#x27;s recent focus has been Toronto&#x27;s community housing. On the Social Affairs Committee he has been instrumental in studies and reports on such matters as poverty, housing, and homelessness; early learning and child care; autism; the Health Accord; prescription pharmaceuticals; obesity; and dementia. In 2012, he founded the All-Party, Anti-Poverty Caucus.

He also started and convened the Open Caucus a non-partisan discussion open to all Senators and MPs on major issues of the day bringing together expert panelists to dialogue with parliamentarians.

In 2015–16, in addition to his Senate work, he served as the volunteer chair of the Toronto Mayor&#x27;s Task force on Toronto Community Housing which recommended substantive reforms for the largest social housing provider in Canada. Many of the recommendations are now in different stages of implementation.

Eggleton retired from the Senate on September 29, 2018, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75.

== Notable Work ==
In July 2018, Eggleton wrote, with fellow Canadian Senator Raymonde Saint-Germain, calling for an update to Canadian privacy legislation, adapting it to protect people&#x27;s data given the rise of new technologies.

Eggleton was the Chair of the World Council on City Data&#x27;s advisory board. The World Council on City Data is an organization that tracks standardized city data across the world to help achieve sustainable development goals.

In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, Eggleton wrote with Canadian political commentator Hugh Segal arguing for a basic income program in Canada, both supporting efforts in the Canadian Senate to establish such a policy.

In November 2021, Eggleton, with a human rights activist Rabia Khedr, called for Canada to fast track the Canada Disability Benefit and follow through with legislation to reduce disability poverty tabled by the Canadian government. Eggleton also published an e-book with four other authors make the case for basic income in Canada.

Eggleton serves on the board of directors of Toronto Kiwanis Boys and Girls Club, a charity that offers social service to youth in Toronto. As a boy in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Eggleton attended and is now a member of the Kiwanis Club of Toronto.

He is also a vice-president of Liberal International, an international consortium of liberal and progressive democratic political parties and citizen groups headquartered in London, England and promoting liberal democracy and liberal values as well as being president of the Canadian Group of Liberal International.

<text>Danebury is an Iron Age hillfort in Hampshire, England, about north-west of Winchester (). The site, covering , was excavated by Barry Cunliffe in the 1970s. Danebury is considered a type site for hillforts, and was important in developing the understanding of hillforts, as very few others have been so intensively excavated.

Built in the 6th century BC, the fort was used for almost 500 years, during a period when the number of hillforts in Wessex greatly increased. Danebury was remodelled several times, making it more complex and resulting in it becoming a &quot;developed&quot; hillfort. It is a Scheduled Monument and a Local Nature Reserve called Danebury Hillfort. The Scheduled Monument is surrounded by a Site of Special Scientific Interest, designated as Danebury Hill.

==Investigation==
Until the 19th century very little was known about hillforts, as none had been excavated and their original purpose had been long forgotten. In the medieval period, their construction was attributed variously to iconic figures such as King Arthur, King Alfred, the Danes, Julius Caesar, and even giants. By the 18th century, it was widely thought that hillforts were Roman in origin.

Interest in hillforts was roused by the investigation of a hillfort at Worlebury Hill in the early-19th century. The first excavation at Danebury was carried out in November 1859, under antiquarian Augustus Wollaston Franks. His workers cleared out an Iron Age pit that was deep and in diameter, although they were not able to ascertain its purpose.

The first widespread investigation of hillforts was carried out in the second half of the 19th century under Augustus Pitt-Rivers. Pitt-Rivers&#x27; work on the hillforts of Sussex led him to the conclusion that most hillforts were built in the Iron Age, and it paved the way for future work on hillforts. In the 1920s and 1930s, there was &quot;hillfort mania&quot; in British archaeology; by 1940, about 80 had been archaeologically excavated.

In the late 1960s, Barry Cunliffe decided to examine a single hillfort and its surrounding territory in an attempt to shed light on Iron Age society, its politics, and population. With the permission of the site&#x27;s owner, Hampshire County Council, archaeological excavations began in 1969 and continued until 1988. Over the twenty seasons archaeologists spent examining the site, they looked at the defences and the gateway, and excavated 57% of the interior, where the remains of wattle and timber houses were discovered. It was the lengthiest investigation of any hillfort in western Europe.

A further non-invasive survey was carried out in 1997, as part of the Wessex Hillforts Project, using a magnetometer.

==History==
There is no historical record of events in Iron Age Britain, so archaeological investigation is the only way to reconstruct the history of Danebury and other forts. It is impossible to state with certainty every significant event in the hillfort’s history, but where an event leaves an archaeologically identifiable trace, a general chronology can be established, although dates are much less easy to establish. The hillfort was occupied from the mid-6th century BC until around 100 BC, and the defences were remodelled numerous times.

Early in its life the site consisted of a single ditch encompassing an area of about , with two gateways, one in the south-west and another in the east; two more rings of ditches were added later. The north part of the fort was occupied by four-post structures, probably granaries, which were later replaced by storage pits, and in the south part, there were roundhouses in between granaries and storage pits. When Danebury was built in the 6th century BC, it coincided with the construction of several other hillforts in the Wessex region, all of a similar size and layout.

The first phase of defences dates from around 550 BC, and consists of a rampart behind a ditch. When the ditch was cut, the chalk rubble fill was used to build the rampart, along with some of the local clay soil. The material was contained by timber, making it a box rampart with a vertical face. The east gateway was a simple gap in the defences with a timber gatehouse (the south-west gateway has not been excavated).

At least 50 years after the rampart was first built, it was raised with the addition of more chalk material; this has been interpreted as maintenance work when the ramparts began to collapse as the timber box started to rot. Around the same time the ramparts were altered, the east gateway was widened to . The gates were burnt down not long after the east gateway was altered. For a short time the hillfort was gateless; when the east gateway was repaired the passage from the entrance was lengthened.

In around 400 BC the third phase heightened the rampart and at the same time the ditch was re-dug. The V-shaped ditch was deep and between and wide; the size of the previous ditch is unknown as re-cutting the ditch has made it hard to ascertain. The wooden box was abandoned in favour of allowing the rampart to slope down to the ditch, but to provide protection the rampart would probably have been surmounted by a dry stone wall made from flint. From the top of the ramparts to the bottom of the ditch is about .

Although the rampart and ditch were in use for a long time, during this period the east gateway was remodelled twice, making it longer, and creating earthworks on each side of the approach. The southwest gateway was given extra defences in the form of earthworks before being abandoned and filled in. Also in this period, the southern part of the fort became populated with four- and six-post structures, probably granaries, replacing the earlier roundhouses. The fort&#x27;s centre was probably used for shrines while houses were mainly built close to the ramparts. A new series of earthworks was created beyond the already existing ring, turning Danebury into a complex multivallate (more than one series of earthworks) fort. These earthworks added to the fort and were probably used to protect livestock.
Danebury was abandoned around 100 BC, in common with the trend across Britain for hillforts to fall out of use around that time. Once again, the east gate was burnt down, although this time it was not replaced. Most of the inhabitants deserted Danebury, and groups of bodies were disposed of in charnel pits. The site continued in use, but on a much smaller scale than before. Buildings were left to decay and the interior of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st century AD, the settlement of Danebury was probably nothing more than a single farm.

==Hillfort==
Danebury Hill, on top of which the hillfort sits, rises to . The hillfort dominates the local landscape, which rarely rises above , and has commanding views of the area. The surrounding country has light soil that would have been easily cultivated. Territory commanded by Danebury included areas of forest, pasture in the uplands, and access to water sources in the form of the River Test. To the west runs Wallop Brook which flows south east into the River Test.

The nearby hillforts of Figsbury Ring, Quarley Hill and Bury Hill were probably established around the same time as Danebury. All of a similar size, the hillforts were generally equally spaced, commanding similar sized territories and resources. There is some debate whether hillforts were purely defensive structures, and to what extent they were occupied. Cunliffe interprets the ramparts as essentially defensive, although he concedes that they may have been a means of displaying wealth and power, as Danebury would have been visible for miles around.

The ramparts were the strongest part of the fort, with the entrances the weakest. The complex gateways support the view that the site was militaristic; the long, curving east entrance maximised the time it would have taken for attackers to enter the fort and would have allowed defenders on the ramparts more time to hurl missiles, while the southwest entrance narrowed, forcing attackers together and causing disarray. Iron Age society was, in Cunliffe&#x27;s view, &quot;effervescent ... essentially unstable, and prone to conflict&quot;, and he uses the possible military nature of hillforts to support this view. The burning of the gates was probably the result of an attack, and the charnel pits dating from the end of the intense period of Danebury&#x27;s occupation contain about 100 bodies, many with injuries that appear to have been inflicted by weapons such as spears and swords.

Surrounding Danebury hillfort are many smaller farmsteads, between and in size. The fort was supplied with grain from the surrounding farmsteads, and could hold 20 times more food than the average farmstead, indicating that Danebury had a higher status than local farmsteads. This is further supported by the fact that the hillfort was used as a &quot;central place&quot; where people could gather to trade and store commodities. Periods of intensified activity in hillforts such as Danebury coinciding with depopulation of the surrounding landscape could indicate the increasing importance of hillforts in society, or that there were times of unrest when people would retreat to the relative safety of a hillfort&#x27;s ramparts.

While other hillforts were abandoned in the 4th century BC, in about 400 BC Danebury grew into what is known as a &quot;developed hillfort&quot;. Danebury&#x27;s importance in the landscape increased over time, as demonstrated by its continued use until around 100 AD. It was possibly inhabited by a king or chieftain and his family, retinue, and craftsmen, and may have housed a population of 200–350. There are traces of craft and industry on a large scale, and use of the site by a social elite is indicated by the presence of shrines in the centre of the fort.

==Meteorite==

The Danebury meteorite is an H5 ordinary chondrite meteorite found in 1974 during the excavation of a grain pit at the hillfort. Originally classified as a lump of slag, it was identified as a meteorite about a decade later. It was found in a grain pit between two layers of infill with no particular evidence of it having been placed there, so it may have fallen directly into the pit. Carbon dating produced a date of 748–230 BC.

The meteorite was originally held by Oxford University but in 2014 was transferred to the Hampshire County Council Arts and Museums Service.

<text>The Lyonnais (, ) is a historical province of France which owes its name to the city of Lyon.

The geographical area known as the &quot;Lyonnais&quot; became part of the Kingdom of Burgundy after the division of the Carolingian Empire. The disintegration of Imperial control, especially after the fall of the Hohenstaufens in 1254, led to French encroachment and eventual acquisition by King Philip IV of France in 1313. Lyonnais now often simply refers to the area around the city of Lyon.

The local speech-form known as &quot;Lyonnais&quot; is a dialect of the Francoprovençal language that is spoken in the region, but its use is marginal.

<doc id="652459" wikidata="Q1467339" url="?curid=652459" title="Hypertriglyceridemia">
<text>Hypertriglyceridemia is the presence of high amounts of triglycerides in the blood. Triglycerides are the most abundant fatty molecule in most organisms. Hypertriglyceridemia occurs in various physiologic conditions and in various diseases, and high triglyceride levels are associated with atherosclerosis, even in the absence of hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol levels) and predispose to cardiovascular disease.

Chronically elevated serum triglyceride levels are a component of metabolic syndrome and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, both of which typically involve obesity and contribute significantly to cardiovascular mortality in industrialised countries as of 2021. Extreme triglyceride levels also increase the risk of acute pancreatitis.

Hypertriglyceridemia itself is usually symptomless, although high levels may be associated with skin lesions known as &quot;xanthomas&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most people with elevated triglycerides experience no symptoms. Some forms of primary hypertriglyceridemia can lead to specific symptoms: both familial chylomicronemia and primary mixed hyperlipidemia include skin symptoms (eruptive xanthoma), eye abnormalities (lipemia retinalis), hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen), and neurological symptoms. Some experience attacks of abdominal pain that may be mild episodes of pancreatitis. Eruptive xanthomas are 2–5 mm papules, often with a red ring around them, that occur in clusters on the skin of the trunk, buttocks and extremities. Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia causes larger, tuberous xanthomas; these are red or orange and occur on the elbows and knees. Palmar crease xanthomas may also occur.

The diagnosis is made on blood tests, often performed as part of screening. Once diagnosed, other blood tests are usually required to determine whether the raised triglyceride level is caused by other underlying disorders (&quot;secondary hypertriglyceridemia&quot;) or whether no such underlying cause exists (&quot;primary hypertriglyceridemia&quot;). There is a hereditary predisposition to both primary and secondary hypertriglyceridemia.
Acute pancreatitis may occur in people whose triglyceride levels are above 1000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L). Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with 1–4% of all cases of pancreatitis. The symptoms are similar to pancreatitis secondary to other causes, although the presence of xanthomas or risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia may offer clues.

==Causes==
* Overeating
* Obesity
* Diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance - it is one of the defined components of metabolic syndrome (along with central obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia)
* Excess alcohol consumption
* Kidney failure, nephrotic syndrome
* Genetic predisposition; some forms of familial hyperlipidemia such as familial combined hyperlipidemia i.e. Type II hyperlipidemia
* Lipoprotein lipase deficiency - Deficiency of this water-soluble enzyme, that hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins, leads to elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood.
* Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency or Cholesteryl ester storage disease
* Certain medications e.g. isotretinoin, hydrochlorothiazide diuretics, beta blockers, protease inhibitors
* Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)
* Lupus and associated autoimmune responses 
* Glycogen storage disease type 1.
* Propofol
* HIV medications
==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made on blood tests, often performed as part of screening. The normal triglyceride level is less than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L). Once diagnosed, other blood tests are usually required to determine whether the raised triglyceride level is caused by other underlying disorders (&quot;secondary hypertriglyceridemia&quot;) or whether no such underlying cause exists (&quot;primary hypertriglyceridaemia&quot;). There is a hereditary predisposition to both primary and secondary hypertriglyceridemia.

=== Guidelines ===

The National Cholesterol Education Program has set guidelines for triglyceride levels:

These levels are tested after fasting 8 to 12 hours. Triglyceride levels remain temporarily higher for a period after eating.

The AHA recommends an optimal triglyceride level of 100mg/dL (1.1mmol/L) or lower to improve heart health.

==Screening==
In 2016, the United States Preventive Services Task Force concluded that testing the general population under the age of 40 without symptoms is of unclear benefit.

==Treatment==
Lifestyle changes including weight loss, exercise and dietary modification may improve hypertriglyceridemia. This may include dietary changes such as restriction of fat and carbohydrates (specifically fructose and sugar-sweetened beverages) and increased consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from algae, nuts, and seeds.

The decision to treat hypertriglyceridemia with medication depends on the levels and on the presence of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Very high levels that would increase the risk of pancreatitis is treated with a drug from the fibrate class. Niacin and omega-3 fatty acids as well as drugs from the statin class may be used in conjunction, with statins being the main drug treatment for moderate hypertriglyceridemia where reduction of cardiovascular risk is required. Medications are recommended in those with high levels of triglycerides that are not corrected with lifestyle modifications, with fibrates being recommended first. Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids) is another prescription drug used to treat very high levels of blood triglycerides.

== Epidemiology ==
As of 2006, the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in the United States was 30%.

==Research==

Analysis of the genes in depression and anxiety showed those linked solely to depression were also linked to hypertriglyceridemia.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;hypertriglyceridemia&quot; uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;triglyceride&quot; + &quot;&quot;, thus corresponding to &quot;high triglyceride levels in the blood&quot; or &quot;too many triglycerides in the blood&quot;.

<text>Sarsen stones are silicified sandstone blocks found extensively across southern England on the Salisbury Plain and the Marlborough Downs in Wiltshire; in Kent; and in smaller quantities in Berkshire, Essex, Oxfordshire, Dorset, and Hampshire.

==Geology==
Sarsen stones are the post-glacial remains of a cap of Cenozoic silcrete that once covered much of southern England. This is thought to have formed during Neogene to Quaternary weathering by the silicification of Upper Paleocene Lambeth Group sediments, resulting from acid leaching.

==Etymology==
There are several potential sources for the word &quot;sarsen.&quot; 

The first is that word &quot;sarsen&quot; is a shortening of &quot;Saracen stone&quot; which arose in the Wiltshire dialect. In the Middle Ages, &quot;Saracen&quot; was a common name for Muslims, and came by extension to be used for anything regarded as non-Christian, whether Muslim or pagan in contrast to Christianity.

The second is that &quot;sarsen&quot; is vernacular variation of the Indo-European &quot;sasan,&quot; name given to the prehistoric vaults of the Chotanagpur plateau of Northern India. 

The third possibility is that &quot;sarsen&quot; comes from the hybrid Anglo-Saxon &quot;sar-stan&quot; or &#x27;troublesome stone.&#x27; &quot;Sar&quot; has the meaning of &#x27;grievous.&#x27;

==Human uses==
The builders of Stonehenge used these stones for the Heel Stone and sarsen circle uprights. Avebury and many other megalithic monuments in southern England are also built with sarsen stones.

While sarsen stones are not an ideal building material, fire and in later times explosives were sometimes employed to break the stone into pieces of a suitable size for use in construction. William Stukeley wrote that sarsen is &quot;always moist and dewy in winter which proves damp and unwholesome, and rots the furniture&quot;. In the case of Avebury, the investors who backed a scheme to recycle the stone were bankrupted when the houses they built proved to be unsaleable and also prone to burning down. However, despite these problems, sarsen remained highly prized for its durability, being a favoured material for steps and kerb stones.

<doc id="652464" wikidata="Q5549449" url="?curid=652464" title="Gerald Nye">
<text>Gerald Prentice Nye (December 19, 1892 – July 17, 1971) was an American politician who represented North Dakota in the United States Senate from 1925 to 1945. Nye rose to national fame in the 1930s as chair of the Special Committee on Investigation of the Munitions Industry, which studied the causes of United States&#x27; involvement in World War I and became known as the Nye Committee. Prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was a prominent opponent of United States involvement in World War II.

==Early life==
Gerald Nye (whose first name was pronounced with a hard &quot;G&quot;) was born in Hortonville, Wisconsin, the son of Phoebe Ella (née Prentice) and Irwin Raymond Nye. Both of his grandfathers had served in the Civil War: Freeman James Nye in the 43rd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment and George Washington Prentice in the 3rd Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry Regiment.

He was the first of four children. In his first year, he and his parents moved to Wittenberg, Wisconsin, where his father became owner and editor of a small newspaper. Three more children were born there: Clair Irwin, Donald Oscar, and Marjorie Ella. Nye&#x27;s father was a staunch supporter of Progressive Robert M. La Follette, and Nye personally remembered his father&#x27;s taking him to hear Senator La Follette speak and then meet the Senator afterwards. (Years later, Gerald Nye and Robert M. La Follette Jr. would serve in the U.S. Senate together.) His uncle, Wallace G. Nye, was Mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota when Gerald was in his teens. 

His mother, Ella, had been diagnosed with tuberculosis. Family history indicates that she may have been asthmatic. She made trips to the South for recuperation, but on October 19, 1906, she died. He was thirteen; his brothers, ten and eight; and his baby sister, six. He was comforted by the presence of his four grandparents at the funeral. Nye graduated from Wittenberg High School in 1911, at age 18, and moved back to his grandparents&#x27; town of Hortonville, Wisconsin. 

==Newspaper years==
Gerald and his brother Clair had grown up helping around their father&#x27;s newspaper business and learned the trade. Gerald took the editing end and Clair operated the presses. In 1911, after graduation, Nye became editor of &quot;The Hortonville Review&quot;. Three years later, he was the editor of the &quot;Creston Daily Plain Dealer&quot; in Iowa. In May 1916, he bought a weekly paper in Fryburg, North Dakota, &quot;The Fryburg Pioneer&quot;.

==Political years==
Nye was a supporter of the agrarian reform movement. His editorials lambasted big government and big business. He took the side of the struggling farmers. In 1924, Nye unsuccessfully sought election as a Democrat to the U.S. House. When U.S. Senator Edwin F. Ladd died on June 22, 1925, he and others gathered in the office of North Dakota Governor Arthur G. Sorlie. The appointment caused controversy as it was unclear that the North Dakota Legislature had given authority to the Governor to make the Senate appointment, a point made by conservative Republicans who were worried about weakening their caucus with the more progressive Nye.

Nye and his young family moved to Washington in December 1925, but because of the above controversy he was not seated in the Senate until January 1926. Nye&#x27;s youth and lack of sophistication were the talk of the town. He had a bowl haircut that was ridiculed. Nevertheless, he became a very active, popular and outspoken Senator, and North Dakotans elected him to three full terms in 1926, 1932, and 1938, before losing to popular Democrat governor John Moses in 1944.
His isolationism drew the attention of Dr. Seuss who featured him in a political cartoon with Gerald L. K. Smith and Democratic Senator Robert Rice Reynolds.The cartoon portrays Smith riding a horse composed of Nye as the rear end of the horse and Reynolds as the front. Smith is holding a sword labeled defeatism. Additional, Seuss cartoons showed Nye riding a dying creature labeled as isolationism, entitled The End of the Trail.
He served on the Foreign Relations Committee, the Appropriations Committee, the Defense Committee and the Public Lands Committee. As Chairman of Public Lands, he dealt with the Teapot Dome investigations and the formation of Grand Teton National Park. He was instrumental in passing legislation to protect public access to the sea coasts. He initially supported Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, but their relationship soured before the decade closed: for instance, Nye was one of four Senators who voted against the Supreme Court nomination of William O. Douglas. He supported the political positions of Robert M. La Follette, and legislation for agricultural price supports.

===Nye Committee===

Between 1934 and 1936, Nye headed an investigation of the munitions industry. The Special Committee on Investigation of the Munitions Industry investigated profiteering in the munitions and banking industry and the possibility that greed was a significant factor in leading the United States into World War I. The Nye Committee as it was commonly known, drew national and international attention. Nye&#x27;s appointment to the chairmanship of this committee came from Senator George Norris. According to peace activist Dorothy Detzer, Norris said, &quot;Nye&#x27;s young, he has inexhaustible energy and he has courage. Those are all important assets. He may be rash in his judgments at times, but it&#x27;s the rashness of enthusiasm.&quot; Senator Norris proposed Nye as &quot;... the only one out of the 96 whom he deemed to have the competence, independence and stature for the task.&quot; Although the committee found little firm evidence of active conspiracy among munitions manufacturers, their reports did little to dispel the notion. A leading member of the Nye Committee staff was Alger Hiss.
According to the United States Senate website:
The investigation came to an abrupt end early in 1936. The Senate cut off committee funding after Chairman Nye blundered into an attack on the late Democratic President Woodrow Wilson. Nye suggested that Wilson had withheld essential information from Congress as it considered a declaration of war. Democratic leaders, including Appropriations Committee Chairman Carter Glass of Virginia, unleashed a furious response against Nye for &#x27;dirtdaubing the sepulcher of Woodrow Wilson.&#x27; Standing before cheering colleagues in a packed Senate Chamber, Glass slammed his fist onto his desk until blood dripped from his knuckles.

===Antiwar movement===
Nye was instrumental in the development and adoption of the Neutrality Acts that were passed between 1935 and 1937. To mobilize antiwar sentiments, he helped establish the America First Committee. According to Nye, American involvement in the &quot;war for democracy&quot; could be explained in terms of a conspiracy of arms manufacturers, politicians and international bankers. In common with many conservative isolationists, Nye subscribed to an antisemitic belief in a Jewish conspiracy pushing the US into war. At a 1941 Senate subcommittee hearing investigating &quot;war-mongering&quot; Hollywood films, Nye stated that those &quot;responsible for the propaganda pictures are born abroad&quot;. He accused Hollywood of attempting to &quot;drug the reason of the American people&quot;, and &quot;rouse war fever&quot;; he was particularly hostile to Warner Brothers.

Despite Nye&#x27;s antiwar positions, he supported the Republican faction in Spain and sought to repeal the embargo against selling arms to either side of the Spanish Civil War. He believed that the embargo aided the Nationalists. Nye criticized Marcelino Garcia Rubiera and Manuel Diaz Riestra for illegally shipping supplies to the Nationalists.

After the German sinking of SS &quot;Robin Moor&quot; by German submarine U-69 in May 1941, Nye said he would be &quot;very much surprised if a German submarine had done it because it would be to their disadvantage&quot; to torpedo the ship.

The day of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Nye attended an America First meeting in Pittsburgh. Before his speech a reporter for the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; told him about the attack, but Nye was skeptical and did not mention the news to the audience. The reporter passed him a note during the speech stating that Japan had declared war; Nye read it but continued speaking. He only announced the attack at the end of his one-hour speech, stating that he had received &quot;the worst news that I have encountered in the last 20 years&quot;. However, the next day Nye joined the rest of the Senate in voting for a unanimous declaration of war.

In April 1943 a confidential report by Isaiah Berlin about the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office stated that Nye:
:is a notorious fire-eating Anglophobe Isolationist. His principal claim to fame rests on his committee which investigated the American armament industry a few years before the war, and much popular anti-British feeling stems from publicity which was accorded to that committee. He is a member of the Farm &quot;Bloc&quot;, and possesses some influence in the Republican senatorial caucus. He has Fascist connexions, and works closely with Wheeler and Reynolds inside and outside the Senate. His &quot;bête noire&quot; is [Wendell] Willkie, whom he hates even more than the British Empire; indeed, he recently went to the length of defending the latter against the criticisms of the former, since he evidently regards any stick as good enough to beat Willkie with.

==Post-Senate years in Washington==
In November 1944, Nye was defeated in his re-election attempt by Governor John Moses, a Democrat. Nye chose to remain in the Washington area. He and his wife had purchased of pasture land in Chevy Chase, part of a farm on a hill above Rock Creek Park. Their two sons had been born in 1943 and 1944. 
Nye organized and became president of Records Engineering, Inc., in Washington, D.C. The pre-computer age firm created, organized, and managed records of industrial and government clients. In 1960 he was appointed to the Federal Housing Administration as Assistant to the Commissioner and in charge of housing for the elderly. In 1963, he accepted an appointment to the professional staff of the U.S. Senate Committee on Aging. 1966 saw his grand retirement party at the U.S. Capitol. It was attended by senators Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy and hosted by Senator Everett Dirksen, who presented Nye with a typewriter and desk lamp and orders to begin his memoirs. Nye became a consultant to churches and private groups desiring government funds for the building of retirement housing.

According to the State Historical Society of North Dakota, U.S. Senator Gerald Nye helped Herman Stern, a North Dakota German Jewish emigrant businessman, and his wife Adeline, bring more than 140 Jewish refugees to the United States in the 1930s and 1940s. Despite claiming to have &quot;Jewish friends&quot;, the Jewish Telegraph Agency accused Nye in September 1941 of making &quot;anti-Jewish insinuations,&quot; &quot;anti-Jewish accusations,&quot; repeated the New York Post&#x27;s accusation that he made a &quot;crudely anti-Semitic radio broadcast&quot; and noted his Senate investigations were accused of having &quot;anti-Semitic motives.&quot; He received criticism from Jews who worked at the New York Daily News, and former Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie would criticize both Nye and fellow pro-America First U.S. Senator Burton Wheeler&#x27;s attacks on Jews involved with the American motion picture industry. It was noted that Nye had recently claimed that the American movie industry was run by &quot;foreign-born Jews&quot; and that the wrath of Americans trying to &quot;find the scapegoat responsible for it all&quot; might lead to &quot;future trouble.&quot; While a large number of Jewish people were involved with Hollywood, Nye ignored the fact that the Hollywood film industry was not self-financed and had to rely on loans from American banks not run by Jews, such as &quot;Chase National Bank, Atlas Corp., and the Rockefellers.”

==Personal life==
Nye was a Freemason and attended Grace Lutheran Church in Washington, D.C.

On August 16, 1916, he married Anna Margaret Johnson in Iowa where she lived with her maternal grandparents and had taken their name, Munch. In 1919, they moved to Cooperstown, North Dakota, where Gerald was the editor and publisher of the &quot;Sentinel Courier&quot;. Anna and Gerald had three children: Marjorie (born 1917), Robert (born 1921), and James (born 1923). His eldest three children grew up on Grosvenor Street in Washington, D.C., and attended high school there. Every summer, Gerald would take the children to Yellowstone National Park where Marjorie and a young Gerald Ford were teenage friends.

In March 1940, Nye divorced his first wife, and on December 14, 1940, he remarried, to an Iowa schoolteacher, A. Marguerite Johnson. They had three children, all born in Washington, D.C. – Gerald Jr. (born 1943), Richard (born 1944), and Marguerite (born 1950).

==Death==
A lifelong smoker, Nye had arterial disease; the arteries in his legs were surgically replaced with plastic arteries, then state-of-the-art. Close to the end of his life, a blood clot went to his lung. While Nye was recovering from that experience, but still weak, a doctor mistakenly prescribed a drug containing penicillin, to which Nye was known to be allergic. As a result, he died on July 17, 1971, at the age of 78.

<doc id="652467" wikidata="Q1141109" url="?curid=652467" title="Room 40">
<text>Room 40, also known as 40 O.B. (old building; officially part of NID25), was the cryptanalysis section of the British Admiralty during the First World War.

The group, which was formed in October 1914, began when Rear-Admiral Henry Oliver, the Director of Naval Intelligence, gave intercepts from the German radio station at Nauen, near Berlin, to Director of Naval Education Alfred Ewing, who constructed ciphers as a hobby. Ewing recruited civilians such as William Montgomery, a translator of theological works from German, and Nigel de Grey, a publisher. It was estimated that during the war Room 40 decrypted around 15,000 intercepted German communications from wireless and telegraph traffic. Most notably the section intercepted and decoded the Zimmermann Telegram, a secret diplomatic communication issued from the German Foreign Office in January 1917 that proposed a military alliance between Germany and Mexico. Its decoding has been described as the most significant intelligence triumph for Britain during World War I because it played a significant role in drawing the then-neutral United States into the conflict.

Room 40 operations evolved from a captured German naval codebook, the (SKM), and maps (containing coded squares) that Britain&#x27;s Russian allies had passed on to the Admiralty. The Russians had seized this material from the German cruiser SMS &quot;Magdeburg&quot; after it ran aground off the Estonian coast on 26 August 1914. The Russians recovered three of the four copies that the warship had carried; they retained two and passed the other to the British. In October 1914 the British also obtained the Imperial German Navy&#x27;s (HVB), a codebook used by German naval warships, merchantmen, naval zeppelins and U-boats: the Royal Australian Navy seized a copy from the Australian-German steamer &quot;Hobart&quot; on 11 October. On 30 November a British trawler recovered a safe from the sunken German destroyer &quot;S-119&quot;, in which was found the (VB), the code used by the Germans to communicate with naval attachés, embassies and warships overseas. Several sources have claimed that in March 1915 a British detachment impounded the luggage of Wilhelm Wassmuss, a German agent in Persia and shipped it, unopened, to London, where the Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiral Sir William Reginald (Blinker) Hall discovered that it contained the German Diplomatic Code Book, Code No. 13040. However, this story has since been debunked.

The section retained &quot;Room 40&quot; as its informal name even though it expanded during the war and moved into other offices. Alfred Ewing directed Room 40 until May 1917, when direct control passed to Hall, assisted by William Milbourne James. Although Room 40 decrypted Imperial German communications throughout the First World War, its function was compromised by the Admiralty&#x27;s insistence that all decoded information would only be analysed by Naval specialists. This meant while Room 40 operators could decrypt the encoded messages they were not permitted to understand or interpret the information themselves.

==Background==
In 1911, a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on cable communications concluded that in the event of war with Germany, German-owned under sea cables should be destroyed. In the early hours of 5 August 1914, the cable ship &quot;Alert&quot; located and cut Germany&#x27;s five trans-Atlantic cables, which ran down the English Channel. Soon after, the six cables running between Britain and Germany were cut. As an immediate consequence, there was a significant increase in cable messages sent via cables belonging to other countries, and messages sent by wireless. These could now be intercepted, but codes and ciphers were naturally used to hide the meaning of the messages, and neither Britain nor Germany had any established organisations to decode and interpret the messages. At the start of the war, the navy had only one wireless station for intercepting messages, at Stockton. However, installations belonging to the Post Office and the Marconi Company, as well as private individuals who had access to radio equipment, began recording messages from Germany.

Intercepted messages began to arrive at the Admiralty intelligence division, but no one knew what to do with them. Rear-Admiral Henry Oliver had been appointed Director of the Intelligence division in 1913. In August, 1914, his department was fully occupied with the war and no-one had experience of code breaking. Instead he turned to a friend, Sir Alfred Ewing, the Director of Naval Education (DNE), who previously had been a professor of engineering with a knowledge of radio communications and who he knew had an interest in ciphers. It was not felt that education would be a priority during the expected few months duration of the war, so Ewing was asked to set up a group for decoding messages. Ewing initially turned to staff of the naval colleges Osborne and Dartmouth, who were currently available, due both to the school holidays and to naval students having been sent on active duty. Alastair Denniston had been teaching German but later became second in charge of Room 40, then becoming Chief of its successor after the First World War, the Government Code and Cypher School (located at Bletchley Park during the Second World War).

Others from the schools worked temporarily for Room 40 until the start of the new term at the end of September. These included Charles Godfrey, the Headmaster of Osborne (whose brother became head of naval Intelligence during the Second World War), two Naval instructors, Parish and Curtiss, and scientist and mathematician Professor Henderson from Greenwich Naval College. Volunteers had to work at code breaking alongside their normal duties, the whole organisation operating from Ewing&#x27;s ordinary office where code breakers had to hide in his secretary&#x27;s room whenever there were visitors concerning the ordinary duties of the DNE. Two other early recruits were R. D. Norton, who had worked for the Foreign Office, and Richard Herschell, who was a linguist, an expert on Persia and an Oxford graduate. None of the recruits knew anything about code breaking but were chosen for knowledge of German and certainty they could keep the matter secret.

==Prelude==
A similar organisation had begun in the Military Intelligence department of the War Office, which became known as MI1b, and Colonel Macdonagh proposed that the two organisations should work together. Little success was achieved except to organise a system for collecting and filing messages until the French obtained copies of German military ciphers. The two organisations operated in parallel, decoding messages concerning the Western Front. A friend of Ewing&#x27;s, a barrister by the name of Russell Clarke, plus a friend of his, Colonel Hippisley, approached Ewing to explain that they had been intercepting German messages. Ewing arranged for them to operate from the coastguard station at Hunstanton in Norfolk, where they were joined by another volunteer, Leslie Lambert (later becoming known as a BBC broadcaster under the name A. J. Alan). Hunstanton and Stockton formed the core of the interception service (known as &#x27;Y&#x27; service), together with the Post Office and Marconi stations, which grew rapidly to the point it could intercept almost all official German messages. At the end of September, the volunteer schoolmasters returned to other duties, except for Denniston; but without a means to decode German naval messages there was little specifically naval work to do.

===Capture of the SKM codebook===

The first breakthrough for Room 40 came with the capture of the (SKM) from the German light cruiser SMS &quot;Magdeburg&quot;. Two light cruisers, &quot;Magdeburg&quot; and SMS &quot;Augsburg&quot;, and a group of destroyers all commanded by Rear-Admiral Behring were carrying out a reconnaissance of the Gulf of Finland, when the ships became separated in fog. &quot;Magdeburg&quot; ran aground on the island of Odensholm off the coast of Russian-controlled Estonia. The ship could not be re-floated so the crew was to be taken on board by the destroyer SMS &quot;V26&quot;. The commander, Habenicht prepared to blow up the ship after it had been evacuated but the fog began to clear and two Russian cruisers &quot;Pallada&quot; and &quot;Bogatyr&quot; approached and opened fire. The demolition charges were set off prematurely, causing injuries amongst the crew still on board and before secret papers could be transferred to the destroyer or disposed of. Habenicht and fifty-seven of his crew were captured by the Russians.

Exactly what happened to the papers is not clear. The ship carried more than one copy of the SKM codebook and copy number 151 was passed to the British. The German account is that most of the secret papers were thrown overboard, but the British copy was undamaged and was reportedly found in the charthouse. The current key was also needed in order to use the codebook. A gridded chart of the Baltic, the ship&#x27;s log and war diaries were all also recovered. Copies numbered 145 and 974 of the SKM were retained by the Russians while was dispatched from Scapa Flow to Alexandrovosk in order to collect the copy offered to the British. Although she arrived on 7 September, due to mix-ups she did not depart until 30 September and returned to Scapa with Captain Kredoff, Commander Smirnoff and the documents on 10 October. The books were formally handed over to the First Lord, Winston Churchill, on 13 October.

The SKM by itself was incomplete as a means of decoding messages, since they were normally enciphered as well as coded and those that could be understood were mostly weather reports. Fleet paymaster C. J. E. Rotter, a German expert from the naval intelligence division, was tasked with using the SKM codebook to interpret intercepted messages, most of which decoded as nonsense since initially it was not appreciated that they were also enciphered. An entry into solving the problem was found from a series of messages transmitted from the German Norddeich transmitter, which were all numbered sequentially and then re-enciphered. The cipher was broken, in fact broken twice as it was changed a few days after it was first solved, and a general procedure for interpreting the messages determined. Enciphering was by a simple table, substituting one letter with another throughout all the messages. Rotter started work in mid October but was kept apart from the other code breakers until November, after he had broken the cipher.

The intercepted messages were found to be intelligence reports on the whereabouts of allied ships. This was interesting but not vital. Russel Clarke now observed that similar coded messages were being transmitted on short-wave, but were not being intercepted because of shortages of receiving equipment, in particular the aerial. Hunstanton was directed to stop listening to the military signals it had been intercepting and instead monitor short-wave for a test period of one weekend. The result was information about the movements of the High Seas Fleet and valuable naval intelligence. Hunstanton was permanently switched to the naval signals and as a result stopped receiving messages valuable to the military. Navy men who had been helping the military were withdrawn to work on the naval messages, without explanation, because the new code was kept entirely secret. The result was a bad feeling between the naval and military interception services and a cessation of cooperation between them, which continued into 1917.

The SKM (sometimes abbreviated SB in German documents) was the code normally used during important actions by the German fleet. It was derived from the ordinary fleet signal books used by both British and German navies, which had thousands of predetermined instructions which could be represented by simple combinations of signal flags or lamp flashes for transmission between ships. The SKM had 34,300 instructions, each represented by a different group of three letters. A number of these reflected old-fashioned naval operations, and did not mention modern inventions such as aircraft. The signals used four symbols not present in ordinary Morse code (given the names alpha, beta, gamma and rho), which caused some confusion until all those involved in interception learnt to recognise them and use a standardised way to write them. Ships were identified by a three-letter group beginning with a beta symbol. Messages not covered by the predetermined list could be spelled out using a substitution table for individual letters.

The sheer size of the book was one reason it could not easily be changed, and the code continued in use until summer 1916. Even then, ships at first refused to use the new codebook because the replacement was too complicated, so the (FFB) did not fully replace the SKB until May 1917. Doubts about the security of the SKB were initially raised by Behring, who reported that it was not definitely known whether &quot;Magdeburg&quot;″s code books had been destroyed or not, and it was suggested at the court martial enquiry into the loss that books might anyway have been recovered by Russians from the clear shallow waters where the ship had grounded. Prince Heinrich of Prussia, commander in chief of Baltic operations, wrote to the C-in-C of the High Seas Fleet, that in his view it was a certainty that secret charts had fallen into the hands of the Russians, and a probability that the codebook and key had also. The German navy relied upon the re-enciphering process to ensure security, but the key used for this was not changed until 20 October and then not changed again for another three months. The actual substitution table used for enciphering was produced by a mechanical device with slides and compartments for the letters. Orders to change the key were sent out by wireless, and frequently confusion during the changeover period led to messages being sent out using the new cipher and then being repeated with the old. Key changes continued to occur infrequently, only 6 times during 1915 from March to the end of the year, but then more frequently from 1916.

There was no immediate capture of the FFB codebook to help the Admiralty understand it, but instead a careful study was made of new and old messages, particularly from the Baltic, which allowed a new book to be reconstructed. Now that the system was understood, Room 40 reckoned to crack a new key within three to four days, and to have reproduced the majority of a new codebook within two months. A German intelligence report on the matter was prepared in 1934 by Kleikamp which concluded that the loss of &quot;Magdeburg&quot;″s codebook had been disastrous, not least because no steps were taken after the loss to introduce new secure codes.

===Capture of the HVB codebook===
The second important code used by the German navy was captured at the very start of the war in Australia, although it did not reach the Admiralty until the end of October. The German-Australian steamer &quot;Hobart&quot; was seized off Port Phillip Heads near Melbourne on 11 August 1914. &quot;Hobart&quot; had not received news that war had broken out, and Captain J. T. Richardson and party claimed to be a quarantine inspection team. &quot;Hobart&quot;″s crew were allowed to go about the ship but the captain was closely observed, until in the middle of the night he attempted to dispose of hidden papers. The (HVB) codebook which was captured contained the code used by the German navy to communicate with its merchant ships and also within the High Seas Fleet. News of the capture was not passed to London until 9 September. A copy of the book was made and sent by the fastest available steamer, arriving at the end of October.

The HVB was originally issued in 1913 to all warships with wireless, to naval commands and coastal stations. It was also given to the head offices of eighteen German steamship companies to issue to their own ships with wireless. The code used 450,000 possible four-letter groups which allowed alternative representations of the same meaning, plus an alternate ten-letter grouping for use in cables. Re-ciphering was again used but for general purposes was more straightforward, although changed more frequently. The code was used particularly by light forces such as patrol boats, and for routine matters such as leaving and entering harbour. The code was used by U-boats, but with a more complex key. However, the complications of their being at sea for long periods meant that codes changed while they were away and often messages had to be repeated using the old key, giving immediate information about the new one. German intelligence were aware in November 1914 that the HVB code had fallen into enemy hands, as evidenced by wireless messages sent out warning that the code was compromised, but it was not replaced until 1916.

The HVB was replaced in 1916 by the (AFB) together with a new method of keying. The British obtained a good understanding of the new keying from test signals, before it was introduced for real messages. The new code was issued to even more organisations than the previous one, including those in Turkey, Bulgaria and Russia. It had more groups than its predecessor but now of only two letters. The first copy to be captured came from a shot-down Zeppelin but others were recovered from sunk U-boats.

===Capture of the VB codebook===
A third codebook was recovered following the sinking of German destroyer SMS &quot;S119&quot; in the Battle off Texel. In the middle of October 1914, the Battle of the Yser was fought for control of the coastal towns of Dixmude and Dunkirk. The British navy took part by bombarding German positions from the sea and German destroyers were ordered to attack the British ships. On 17 October Captain Cecil Fox commanding the light cruiser &quot;Undaunted&quot; together with four destroyers, , &quot;Lennox&quot;, &quot;Legion&quot; and &quot;Loyal&quot;, was ordered to intercept an anticipated German attack and met four German torpedo boats (&quot;S115&quot;, &quot;S117&quot;, &quot;S118&quot;, and &quot;S119&quot;) heading south from Texel with instructions to lay mines. The German ships were outclassed and all were sunk after a brief battle, whereupon the commander of &quot;S119&quot; threw overboard all secret papers in a lead-lined chest. The matter was dismissed by both sides, believing the papers had been destroyed along with the ships. However, on 30 November a British trawler dragged up the chest which was passed to Room 40 (Hall later claimed the vessel had been searching deliberately). It contained a copy of the (VB) codebook, normally used by flag officers of the German Navy. Thereafter the event was referred to by Room 40 as &quot;the miraculous draft of fishes&quot;.

The code consisted of 100,000 groups of 5-digit numbers, each with a particular meaning. It had been intended for use in cables sent overseas to warships and naval attachés, embassies and consulates. It was used by senior naval officers with an alternative &quot;Lambda&quot; key, none of which failed to explain its presence on a small destroyer at the start of the war. Its greatest importance during the war was that it allowed access to communications between naval attachés in Berlin, Madrid, Washington, Buenos Aires, Peking, and Constantinople.

In 1917 naval officers switched to a new code with a new key &quot;Nordo&quot; for which only 70 messages were intercepted, but the code was also broken. For other purposes VB continued in use throughout the war. Re-ciphering of the code was accomplished using a key made up of a codeword transmitted as part of the message and its date written in German. These were written down in order and then the letters in this key were each numbered according to their order of appearance in the alphabet. This now produced a set of numbered columns in an apparently random order. The coded message would be written out below these boxes starting top left and continuing down the page once a row was filled. The final message was produced by taking the column numbered &#x27;1&#x27; and reading off its contents downward, then adding on the second column&#x27;s digits, and so on. In 1918 the key was changed by using the keywords in a different order. This new cipher was broken within a few days by Professor Walter Horace Bruford, who had started working for Room 40 in 1917 and specialised in VB messages. Two messages were received of identical length, one in the new system and one in the old, allowing the changes to be compared.

===Room 40===
In early November 1914 Captain William Hall, son of the first head of Naval Intelligence, was appointed as the new DID to replace Oliver, who had first been transferred to Naval Secretary to the First Lord and then Chief of the Admiralty War Staff. Hall had formerly been captain of the battlecruiser &quot;Queen Mary&quot; but had been forced to give up sea duties due to ill health. Hall was to prove an extremely successful DID, despite the accidental nature of his appointment.

Once the new organisation began to develop and show results it became necessary to place it on a more formal basis than squatting in Ewing&#x27;s office. On 6 November 1914 the organisation moved to Room 40 in the Admiralty Old Building, which was by default to give it its name. Room 40 has since been renumbered, but still exists in the original Admiralty Building off Whitehall, London, on the first floor, with windows looking inwards to a courtyard wholly enclosed by Admiralty buildings. Previous occupants of the room had complained that no one was ever able to find it, but it was on the same corridor as the Admiralty boardroom and the office of the First Sea Lord, Sir John Fisher, who was one of the few people allowed to know of its existence. Adjacent was the First Lord&#x27;s residence (then Winston Churchill), who was another of those people. Others permitted to know of the existence of a signals interception unit were the Second Sea Lord, the Secretary of the Admiralty, the Chief of Staff (Oliver), the Director of Operations Division (DOD) and the assistant director, the Director of Intelligence Division (DID, Captain William Hall) and three duty captains. Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson, a retired First Sea Lord, had returned to the admiralty to work with the staff and was also included in the secret. The Prime Minister may also have been informed.

All messages received and decoded were to be kept completely secret, with copies only being passed to the Chief of Staff and Director of Intelligence. It was decided that someone from the intelligence department needed to be appointed to review all the messages and interpret them from the perspective of other information. Rotter was initially suggested for the job, but it was felt preferable to retain him in code breaking and Commander Herbert Hope was chosen, who had previously been working on plotting the movements of enemy ships. Hope was initially placed in a small office in the west wing of the Admiralty in the intelligence section, and waited patiently for the few messages which were approved for him to see. Hope reports that he attempted to make sense of what he was given and make useful observations about them, but without access to the wider information being received his early remarks were generally unhelpful. He reported to Hall that he needed more information, but Hall was unable to help. On 16 November, after a chance meeting with Fisher where he explained his difficulties, Hope was granted full access to the information together with instructions to make twice daily reports to the First Sea Lord. Hope knew nothing of cryptanalysis or German, but working with the code breakers and translators he brought detailed knowledge of naval procedures to the process, enabling better translations and then interpretations of received messages. In the interests of secrecy the intention to give a separate copy of messages to the DID was dispensed with so that only the Chief of Staff received one, and he was to show it to the First Sea Lord and Arthur Wilson.

As the number of intercepted messages increased, it became part of Hope&#x27;s duties to decide which were unimportant and should just be logged, and which should be passed on outside Room 40. The German fleet was in the habit each day of reporting by wireless the position of each ship, and giving regular position reports when at sea. It was possible to build up a precise picture of the normal operation of the High Seas Fleet, indeed to infer from the routes they chose where defensive minefields had been placed and where it was safe for ships to operate. Whenever a change to the normal pattern was seen, it signalled that some operation was about to take place and a warning could be given. Detailed information about submarine movements was available. Most of this information, however, was retained wholly within Room 40 although a few senior members of the Admiralty were kept informed, as a huge priority was placed by the Staff upon keeping secret the British ability to read German transmissions.

Jellicoe, commanding the Grand Fleet, on three occasions requested from the Admiralty that he should have copies of the codebook which his cruiser had brought back to Britain, so that he could make use of it intercepting German signals. Although he was aware that interception was taking place, little of the information ever got back to him, or it did so very slowly. No messages based upon Room 40 information were sent out except those approved by Oliver personally (except for a few authorised by the First Lord or First Sea Lord). Although it might have been impractical and unwise for code breaking to have taken place on board ship, members of Room 40 were of the view that full use was not being made of the information they had collected, because of the extreme secrecy and being forbidden to exchange information with the other intelligence departments or those planning operations.

===Signals interception and direction finding===
The British and German interception services began to experiment with direction-finding radio equipment in the start of 1915. Captain Round, working for Marconi, had been carrying out experiments for the army in France and Hall instructed him to build a direction-finding system for the navy. At first this was sited at Chelmsford but the location proved a mistake and the equipment was moved to Lowestoft. Other stations were built at Lerwick, Aberdeen, York, Flamborough Head and Birchington and by May 1915 the Admiralty was able to track German submarines crossing the North Sea. Some of these stations also acted as &#x27;Y&#x27; stations to collect German messages, but a new section was created within Room 40 to plot the positions of ships from the directional reports. A separate set of five stations was created in Ireland under the command of the Vice Admiral at Queenstown for plotting ships in the seas to the west of Britain and further stations both within Britain and overseas were operated by the Admiral commanding reserves.

The German navy knew of British direction-finding radio and in part this acted as a cover, when information about German ship positions was released for operational use. The two sources of information, from directional fixes and from German reports of their positions, complemented each other. Room 40 was able to observe, using intercepted wireless traffic from Zeppelins which were given position fixes by German directional stations to help their navigation, that the accuracy of British systems was better than their German counterparts. This was explainable by the wider baseline used in British equipment.

Room 40 had very accurate information on the positions of German ships but the Admiralty&#x27;s priority remained to keep the existence of this knowledge secret. Hope was shown the regular reports created by the Intelligence Division about German ship whereabouts so that he might correct them. This practice was shortly discontinued, for fear of giving away their knowledge. From June 1915, the regular intelligence reports of ship positions were no longer passed to all flag officers, only to Jellicoe, who was the only person to receive accurate charts of German minefields prepared from Room 40 information. Some information was passed to Beatty (commanding the battlecruisers), Tyrwhitt (Harwich destroyers) and Keyes (submarines) but Jellicoe was unhappy with the arrangement. He requested that Beatty should be issued with the &quot;Cypher B&quot; (reserved for secret messages between the Admiralty and him) to communicate more freely and complained that he was not getting sufficient information.

All British ships were under instructions to use radio as sparingly as possible and to use the lowest practical transmission power. Room 40 had benefited greatly from the free chatter between German ships, which gave them many routine messages to compare and analyse, and from the German habit of transmitting at full power, making the messages easier to receive. Messages to Scapa were never to be sent by wireless, and when the fleet was at sea, messages might be sent using lower power and relay ships (including private vessels), to make German interception more difficult. No attempts were made by the German fleet to restrict its use of wireless until 1917 and then only in response to perceived British use of direction finding, not because it believed messages were being decoded.

==Zimmermann Telegram==

Room 40 played an important role in several naval engagements during the war, notably in detecting major German sorties into the North Sea that led to the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915 and the Battle of Jutland in 1916, as the British fleet was sent out to intercept them. Its most notable contribution was in decrypting the Zimmermann Telegram, a telegram from the German Foreign Office sent in January 1917 via Washington to its ambassador Heinrich von Eckardt in Mexico. It has been called the most significant intelligence triumph for Britain during World War I, and one of the earliest occasions on which a piece of signals intelligence influenced world events.

In the telegram&#x27;s plaintext, Nigel de Grey and William Montgomery learned of German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann&#x27;s offer to Mexico of United States&#x27; territories of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas as an enticement to join the war as a German ally. The telegram was passed to the U.S. by Captain Hall, and a scheme was devised (involving a still unknown agent in Mexico and a burglary) to conceal how its plaintext had become available and also how the U.S. had gained possession of a copy. The telegram was made public by the United States, which declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, entering the war on the Allied side.

==Staffers==
Other staff of Room 40 included Frank Adcock, Emily Anderson, John Beazley, Francis Birch, Walter Horace Bruford, William &#x27;Nobby&#x27; Clarke, Alastair Denniston, Frank Cyril Tiarks and Dilly Knox.

==Merger with Military Intelligence (MI)==
In 1919, Room 40 was deactivated and its function merged with the British Army&#x27;s intelligence unit MI1b to form the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS). This unit was housed at Bletchley Park during the Second World War and subsequently renamed Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and relocated to Cheltenham.

<doc id="652479" wikidata="Q3623431" url="?curid=652479" title="Lake Merritt">
<text>Lake Merritt is a lake located in a large tidal lagoon basin in the center of Oakland, California, just east of Downtown. It is named after Samuel Merritt, Oakland&#x27;s mayor in 1867–1869, who had the lagoon dammed turning the varying tidal lagoon into a stable salt-water lake. It is surrounded by parkland and city neighborhoods. Historically significant as the first official wildlife refuge in the United States, designated in 1870, the lake has been listed as a National Historic Landmark since 1963. The circumference of the lake is , with an area of .

The lake features grassy shores, several artificial islands intended as bird refuges, and an interpretive center called the Rotary Nature Center at Lakeside Park. There is a small fairy-tale themed amusement park called Children&#x27;s Fairyland and The Gardens at Lake Merritt is also in the park. A popular walking and jogging path runs along the lake&#x27;s perimeter.

==History==
The lake was originally an arm of San Francisco Bay, formed where several creeks empty into the bay. It was surrounded by of wetlands when the Ohlone people fished, hunted, and gathered food along its shores. By 1810, the remaining Native Americans were removed to Mission San José, and the estuary and of surrounding land was deeded to Sergeant Luis Maria Peralta to become Rancho San Antonio. After gold was discovered in 1848 in present-day Coloma to the northeast, Anglo squatters led by lawyer Horace Carpentier took control of the East Bay area which was to become downtown Oakland, including the estuary known as &quot;San Antonio Slough&quot;. In 1856, Peralta fought and won a United States Supreme Court case against the squatters, but further court cases between his sons and daughters would greatly diminish their holdings. The Peralta brothers had to sell much of the land to Carpentier to pay legal fees and new property taxes. Oakland was incorporated in 1852 with Carpentier as its first mayor, and the estuary became the city&#x27;s sewer.
Lake Merritt naturally had tidal flows via a broad 600-foot outlet, but this has been steadily reduced with development of the region after 1869. Currently, the tidal flows are limited in size and managed for flood control. For years, the lake acted as a waste collector. It was regarded as ideal for sewage because of its chemical contents, which have high acidities that cause it to decompose human feces at very high rates. Sixty miles of brick and wood channeling sent the broken-down sewage to the bottom of the lake to then be eaten by bottom feeders. The stench at the lake during the decomposition of the sewage was a problem for Oaklanders on the west shore and residents of Clinton and San Antonio villages on the east.

Samuel Merritt, Oakland&#x27;s mayor (1867–1869), who owned property at the shore&#x27;s edge, was keen to get the body of water cleaned up so that it could become a source of civic pride. In 1868, he proposed and funded a dam between the estuary and the bay by which the flow of water could be controlled, allowing the water level inland to rise higher and become less saline, turning the tidal lagoon into a lake. Sewage was to be redirected elsewhere by two new city projects, though these weren&#x27;t completed until 1875. The resulting body of water was called variously &quot;Lake Peralta&quot;, &quot;Merritt&#x27;s Lake&quot; and later Lake Merritt.

The lake at that time still had thick wetlands fringing the shores and it continued to attract large numbers of migratory birds. In order to protect the birds from duck hunters and stop the noise and danger of gunfire so close to the city, Merritt proposed to turn the lake into a wildlife refuge in 1869. The state legislature voted Lake Merritt Wildlife Refuge into law in 1870, making it the first such refuge in North America. No hunting of any sort was to be allowed and the only fishing was to be by hook and line.
The ornate Camron-Stanford House was built in 1876 near the lake&#x27;s western shore. Tax records suggest that Samuel Merritt built the Italianate Victorian as part of his plan to promote and develop downtown Oakland and the new lake. In 1877, the house&#x27;s title was transferred to Mrs. Alice Camron, a purchase she was able to make due to an inheritance from her father, California pioneer John Marsh. She, her husband Will, and their two daughters were the first residents of the home. Further fine homes were built on the lakeshore by others following Merritt&#x27;s lead, though none but Camron-Stanford remain today. Beginning in 1910, the house served as the Oakland Public Museum. In 1967, the Oakland Museum moved to other quarters, and the Camron-Stanford House is now a separate museum.

Protection for the wetlands was nonexistent and residences kept being built on reclaimed land around the shore of the lake. Cleanliness continued to be a problem because of incomplete sewage projects, and the lake kept silting up since the natural tidal flow had been interrupted by Merritt&#x27;s dam. Dredging of the lake began in 1891, with the removed silt being piled along the eastern shore to make a foundation for a road which became Lakeshore Avenue.

From 1893 to 1915, Lake Merritt saw major changes. Inspired by the new City Beautiful movement, which got its start at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition (Chicago World&#x27;s Fair), the lake became a city-owned park. In 1913, an elaborate Mission Revival pergola was constructed at the northeastern tip of the lake. Adam&#x27;s Point was cleared of houses, planted with lawns and imported trees, and became Lakeside Park. Eastshore Park was created where East 18th Street brought Trestle Glen&#x27;s watershed to the lake. Oakland Civic Auditorium was built at the south edge of the lake in 1914.
1923 saw Cleveland Cascade spring into life, conceived and assisted by noted landscape architect, Howard Gilkey. This was a three-tiered water feature incorporating multiple waterfalls tumbling sequentially into twenty large collection basins and a pool at the bottom, flanked by twin stairs descending from Merritt Avenue in Cleveland Heights to Lakeshore Avenue. Colored lights in rainbow sequence lit the waterfall at night.

In 1925, the &quot;Necklace of Lights&quot; was turned on.

1929 is the year the luxurious Bellevue-Staten apartments were completed at 492 Staten Avenue in Adam&#x27;s Point near Lakeside Park. The 15-story blend of Art Deco and Spanish Colonial styles is one of the most prominent sights viewable from nearly every point of Lake Merritt.

Lake Merritt&#x27;s natural wetlands are long gone—converted to parks, pathways and roads. Some of the wetland vegetation has been restored to five &quot;Bird Islands&quot; constructed of dredged silt between 1925 and 1956, sheltering hundreds of nesting and roosting water fowl. The islands have a fresh water irrigation system to bring drinking water to the birds. A boom and a rope/buoy barrier protects the islands from recreational boaters.

Under the name &quot;Lake Merritt Wild Duck Refuge&quot;, the site became a National Historic Landmark on May 23, 1963.

Children&#x27;s Fairyland is a 10-acre park designed by William Russell Everett and built in 1950 in Lakeside Park. When Walt Disney was planning Disneyland, he visited Children&#x27;s Fairyland for ideas.

Starting in 1961, Oakland&#x27;s &quot;Downtown Property Owner&#x27;s Association&quot; and the &quot;Central Business District Association&quot; repeatedly advocated for extending Alice Street directly through Snow Park, which was then the grounds of the Snow Museum, past the Schilling Gardens and the Bechtel Building at 244 Lakeside Drive, and down to the lake&#x27;s edge on 20th Street. They purportedly sought to alleviate motorist traffic congestion that might be caused by the closure of Broadway during construction of the nearby BART line. The plan met stiff opposition from Oakland&#x27;s City Council in October 1964, which, as reported by the Staff of the Oakland Tribune at the time, told downtown property interests to &quot;quit wasting its time.&quot;

While celebrations at Lake Merritt have been largely peaceful and lively, several incidents of violence have marred the park during events. A shooting at a 2021 Father&#x27;s Day event involving two San Francisco factions left two dead and five wounded. An event on Juneteenth 2024 in June left 15 wounded.

==Necklace of lights==

A &quot;necklace of lights&quot; encircles Lake Merritt. Featuring 126 lampposts and 3,400 &quot;pearly bulbs&quot;, the necklace was first lit in 1925. In 1941, the lights were removed to comply with World War II blackout conditions. After a decade-long campaign by the Lake Merritt Breakfast Club, the lights were again illuminated in 1987.

During Oakland&#x27;s annual gay pride celebration, the city replaces the white bulbs with multicolored bulbs.

==Wildlife==

=== Birds ===

The lake features a healthy year-round population of birds. It sees seasonal fluctuations in the types of birds that call the lake home.

====Year round====
Year round, the lake is home to many Canada geese and moderate numbers of black-crowned night heron, great egret, snowy egret, cormorant, American coot, and western gull. There are also small mallard duck and pelican (both American and brown) populations.

====Rainy season====
From November through March, the lake plays host to a very large population of greater scaup and lesser scaup, which spend most of their time floating on the water. The tufted duck, a rare bird from Eurasia, has also been recorded annually. Smaller numbers of canvasback, redhead, common and Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye, bufflehead, and other migratory diving ducks are also present during the cold season.

====Dry season====
From June until the end of September, the lake&#x27;s Canada goose population increases significantly; Canada geese become nearly ubiquitous around the perimeter of the lake. In late summer and early fall, a moderate pelican population also arrives, and Caspian terns can be seen on the lake.

=== Other ===
Fish in Lake Merritt include bat rays and gobies. Chinook salmon have also been recorded. Molluscs include sea hares, bay mussels, and oysters. Crustaceans include barnacles and &quot;Transorchestia enigmatica&quot;, which is a talitridae found only in Lake Merritt.

==Plants==
Although native trees such as coast live oak and California buckeye are present, most of the park bordering Lake Merritt has been landscaped with plants from around the world. As early as 1910, City Park Commissioners recognized Oakland as a city of immigrants, and felt that &quot;visitors to the park would want to see plants from their native lands&quot;. This theme of diversity in the park landscape has continued with landscape renovations. The lake&#x27;s iconic plant is the New Zealand tea tree (&quot;Leptospermum&quot; sp.), which grows with picturesque gnarled branches along the water&#x27;s edge.

One zone of native plants has been established at the restored tidal marsh, located on the channel just south of the Lake Merritt Blvd. bridge. Pickleweed has been planted within the tidal zone, and other native plants such as saltgrass, marsh gumplant (&quot;Grindelia stricta&quot; var. &quot;angustifolia&quot;), marsh baccharis (&quot;Baccharis glutinosa&quot;), &quot;Jaumea&quot;, and &quot;Frankenia&quot; have been propagated from local genetic stock and planted on the slope above the marsh. A second native marsh plant zone is planned for the shoreline east of the Sailboat House.

Aquatic vegetation commonly seen within the lake itself include widgeon grass (&quot;Ruppia maritima&quot;), filamentous green algae (&quot;Enteromorpha&quot; and &quot;Cladophora&quot; sp.), sea lettuce (&quot;Ulva&quot; sp.), dead man&#x27;s fingers (&quot;Codium fragile&quot;), and occasionally wireweed (&quot;Sargassum muticum&quot;). Growth of these aquatic plants reaches a peak in mid-June, and the subsequent die-off and decomposition can result in bad odors, unsightly appearance, and depletion of oxygen in the water column. To prevent this nuisance condition, the City uses a floating mechanical harvester to remove excess growth during the summer months.

A red algal bloom (&quot;Heterosigma akashiwo&quot;) was detected in Lake Merritt in March 2024, but dissipated within about 2 weeks.

The most common aquatic plants in Lake Merritt are tiny, free-floating phytoplankton. Visitors often do not appreciate the sometimes-murky water in the lake, but the cloudiness represents a water column rich in microscopic life, providing a basis for a diverse and thriving web of animal life at the lake, both marine and avian.

== Connecting waterways ==
Creeks that flow to Lake Merritt include Glen Echo Creek, Pleasant Valley Creek, Wildwood Creek, and Indian Gulch Creek.

==Cleanup and restoration==

Because storm drains in downtown Oakland and surrounding areas drain directly into the lake, trash and nutrient pollution have become the largest problems affecting Lake Merritt. Increased levels of chemicals like nitrogen and phosphorus cause algae blooms, which deplete the water of oxygen. Aeration fountains, funded by donations, have been installed to help with this problem. &quot;Water quality in an area of about one acre around each unit is improved by the transfer of oxygen from the air, and by mixing the top and bottom layers of the Lake.&quot; A proposed aeration system was never approved by the City of Oakland.

Trash removal is coordinated by the non-profit Lake Merritt Institute under contract with the City of Oakland. The Institute sponsors clean-ups five days a week during the school year, and four days a week during the summer. Individuals can also work alone using the four &quot;U-Clean-It&quot; boxes maintained by the Institute. One way volunteers clean the lake is by using long-handled nets. About 1,000 to 6,000 pounds of trash are removed monthly. Among the many individual and group volunteers, of special note are those who have been cleaning the trash since 1997: the regular Saturday and Tuesday volunteers, the Peralta Service Corporation (part of the Unity Council), St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal School 6th Grade, and HandsOn Bay Area.

=== Pollution ===
In addition to nutrient pollution, more toxic agents have drained into the lake from time to time. In 1998, about 20 gallons of diesel fuel leaked into the lake following a &quot;freakish accident&quot; in the basement of the Caltrans building in the 100 block of Grand Avenue.

On June 27, 2011, the Oakland Fire Department and California Department of Fish and Game responded to a diesel fuel spill that covered five acres of the northwest side of the lake. &quot;Because the storm drain connects to other storm drains in the city, and due to the heavy rain, Oakland Fire Battalion Chief Darin White said firefighters were having difficulty finding where the spill originated.&quot;

==Measure DD improvements==

Measure DD, a $198 million Oakland City park bond measure, passed with 80% voter approval in 2002. The measure improved the lake area by adding park space and altering the surrounding infrastructure. One example is on Lake Merritt&#x27;s south shore, where the previous configuration of 12th Street (six lanes in each direction) was considered a deterrent to pedestrian and bicycle access to landmarks such as Laney College, the Oakland Museum of California, and Lake Merritt Channel. Part of the Measure DD project renovated 12th Street, reducing traffic to three lanes in each direction, adding park space, and adding eleven more necklaces of lights to fill a gap.

The renovation of Lake Merritt, paid for with money from Measure DD, was briefly stalled by an environmental review lawsuit intended to prevent cutting trees around the lake, which was filed in 2006 by a group of concerned residents, &quot;Friends of the Lake&quot;.
On October 17, 2007, an Alameda County Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit, making way for the renovation to proceed.
One of the first Measure DD projects, completed in 2007, was the renovation and rededication of the 1913 pergola at the north end of the lake. Several sections of Measure DD work were completed in 2008, including the renovation of the 1909 Municipal Boat House into Lake Chalet restaurant, the reconstruction of El Embarcadero between Grand Avenue and Lakeshore Avenue, the narrowing of Lakeside Drive from just north of East 14th Street to 19th Street from four lanes to two (with a bicycle lane added), and new landscaping along the west side of the lake from 14th to 19th street and the east side from East 18th Street to El Embarcadero.

The largest part of the Measure DD work was the 12th Street Reconstruction Project on the south side of the lake. Replacement of the Frickstad Viaduct, or &quot;12th Street Dam&quot; (built 1950), and renovation of the roadways and tunnels between the Kaiser Convention Center and the southern end of Lake Merritt began in May 2010 and were completed in June 2013. The groundbreaking ceremony for the 12th Street Project took place on May 6, 2010 near the Frickstad Viaduct.

Another major milestone in the restoration of Lake Merritt was achieved in February 2013, when Mayor Jean Quan and other officials inaugurated a -long channel, including a paved trail, a pedestrian bridge, and restored tidal marsh, a major step towards reconnecting Lake Merritt with San Francisco Bay. This stage was expected to double the water volume circulating in and out of the lake. The mayor announced plans for &quot;a big citywide party&quot; upon completion. In December 2016, a culvert under 10th Street was removed to increase tidal movement.

<doc id="652494" wikidata="Q1596624" url="?curid=652494" title="Rijsttafel">
<text>( , ), a Dutch word that literally translates to &quot;rice table&quot;, is an Indonesian elaborate meal adapted by the Dutch following the &quot;hidang&quot; presentation of &quot;nasi padang&quot; from the Padang region of West Sumatra. It consists of many (forty is not an unusual number) side dishes served in small portions, accompanied by rice prepared in several different ways. Popular side dishes include egg rolls, sambals, satay, fish, fruit, vegetables, pickles, and nuts. In most areas where it is served, such as the Netherlands, and other areas of strong Dutch influence (such as parts of the West Indies), it is known under its Dutch name.

Although the dishes served are undoubtedly Indonesian, the &quot;rijsttafel&quot;’s origins were colonial. The Dutch introduced the rice table not only so they could enjoy a wide array of dishes at a single sitting but also to impress visitors with the exotic abundance of their colony.

&quot;Rijsttafels&quot; strive to feature an array of not only flavors and colors and degrees of spiciness but also textures, an aspect that is not commonly discussed in Western food. Such textures may include crispy, chewy, slippery, soft, hard, velvety, gelatinous, and runny.

==History==
The &quot;rijsttafel&quot; was created to provide a festive and official type of banquet that would represent the multi-ethnic nature of the Indonesian archipelago. Dishes were assembled from many of the far flung regions of Indonesia, where many different cuisines exist, often determined by ethnicity and culture of the particular island or island group — from Javanese favourite &quot;sateh&quot;, &quot;tempeh&quot; and &quot;seroendeng&quot;, to vegetarian cuisine &quot;gado-gado&quot; and &quot;lodeh&quot; with &quot;sambal lalab&quot; from Batavia and Preanger. From spicy &quot;rendang&quot; and &quot;gulai&quot; curry from the Minangkabau region in Sumatra, to East Indies ubiquitous dishes &quot;nasi goreng&quot;, &quot;soto ayam&quot;, and &quot;kroepoek&quot; crackers. Also Indonesian dishes from hybrid influences, such as Chinese &quot;babi ketjap&quot;, &quot;loempia&quot;, and &quot;bami&quot; to European beef smoor. And there are many others from the hundreds of inhabited islands, which contain more than 300 regional and ethnic language groups.

During its centuries of popularity in Dutch East Indies, lines of servants or sarong-clad waitresses ceremoniously served the marathon meal on platters laden with steaming bowls of fragrant foods. The first to be served was a cone-shaped pile of rice on a large platter, which the server placed in the center of the table. The servers then surrounded the rice platter with as many as 40 small bowls holding meat and vegetable dishes as well as condiments. During its colonial heyday until Japanese occupation of Dutch East Indies in 1942, the most celebrated &quot;rijsttafel&quot; in the Indies was served for Sunday luncheon at the Hotel des Indes in Batavia and the Savoy Homann Hotel in Bandung, where the rice was accompanied by sixty different dishes.

Brought back to the Netherlands by former colonials and exiled Indonesians and Indo-Europeans (Eurasians) after Indonesia gained its independence in 1945, the &quot;rijsttafel&quot; was predominantly popular with Dutch families with colonial roots. On the other hand, when Indonesia proclaimed its independence in 1945, nationalist sentiment promoted the rejection of Dutch colonial culture and customs, including the flamboyant rice table. Today, the rice table has practically disappeared from Indonesia&#x27;s restaurants and is served only by a handful of fine-dining restaurants in Indonesia. A typical &quot;rijsttafel&quot; will have several dining tables covered with different dishes; while in some fancy settings in Indonesia, each dish may be served by a separate waitress. 

Since about 1990, Indonesian food has become part of a mainstream interest in Southeast Asian cuisine, and there has been a proliferation of Indonesian restaurants in the Netherlands.

==Typical dishes==
The following is a brief, but not nearly complete, list of examples of foods that may be found on a &quot;rijsttafel&quot;:
* Acar – pickled vegetables
* Babi kecap – pork belly braised in sweet soy sauce common in the Netherlands; a halal Indonesian version often uses beef variant known as &quot;semur&quot;
* Babi panggang – roasted pork in a tomato based sauce 
* Bebek betutu – duck roasted in banana leaves
* Bebek Peking – Chinese-style roasted duck
* Capcay – stir-fried vegetables
* Empal gentong – curry-like beef soup
* Gado-gado – vegetables (cooked or fresh) with peanut sauce (&quot;sambal kacang&quot;)
* Gudeg – young jackfruit with palm sugar and coconut milk
* Karedok – vegetable salad in peanut sauce
* Krupuk – chips
* Lemper – rice rolls with spicy filling
* Lumpia – spring rolls
* Nasi goreng – fried rice
* Nasi kuning – Indonesian yellow rice
* Nasi uduk – steamed rice in coconut milk
* Opor ayam – chicken coconut curry
* Pecel – vegetable salad in peanut sauce
* Perkedel – meat and potato patties
* Pisang goreng – banana fritters
* Rawon – blackish beef soup
* Rendang – aromatic spicy caramelized beef, braised in coconut milk, chillies, and spices 
* Sambal iris – onion, tomato, and chilli paste
* Sambal kacang – peanut sauce
* Sambal ulek – spicy chilli paste
* Satay (sometimes spelled &quot;saté&quot;, &quot;sate&quot;, or &quot;sateh&quot;) – various thinly sliced meats, marinated then broiled on a skewer, such as: &quot;sate ayam&quot; (chicken); &quot;sate babi&quot; (pork); &quot;sate lilit&quot; (seafood)
* Sayur lodeh – vegetable stew (spicy) in coconut milk
* Semur daging – a type of stew of beef braised in sweet soy sauce
* Serundeng – peanuts with sautéed shredded coconut
* Tahu telur – tofu omelette
* Telur balado – hard-boiled eggs sautéed in chilli sauce
* Telur bumbu bali – hard-boiled eggs sautéed in Balinese spice mixture

==Today==

Despite its popularity in the Netherlands and abroad, the &quot;rijsttafel&quot; is rarely found in Indonesia. That is probably because most Indonesian meals consist of rice accompanied by only one, two or three dishes, mostly consisting of &quot;lauk&quot; (fish, chicken, meat, egg, or other source of protein), &quot;sayur&quot; (vegetable), and other side dishes. To consume more than that number of dishes at once (a &quot;rijsttafel&quot; might range from seven to forty dishes) is considered too extravagant and too expensive. The closest versions to rice table dishes readily available in Indonesia are local nasi Padang and nasi campur. However, in Indonesian restaurants around the world, especially in Belgium, the Netherlands, and South Africa, the &quot;rijsttafel&quot; is still popular.

Today only a handful of dining establishments in Indonesia ceremoniously serve elaborate colonial-style &quot;rijsttafel&quot;. &quot;Rijsttafel&quot; is commonly found only in select upscale Indonesian restaurants, mainly the ones in Jakarta. In July 2011, the airline Garuda Indonesia launched Indonesian &quot;rijsttafel&quot; in Executive Class as its signature in-flight service. This Indonesian signature dining was meant to introduce the passenger to a wide array of Indonesian cuisine in a single setting as part of Garuda Indonesia experience. This in-flight Indonesian &quot;rijsttafel&quot; includes Indonesian signature dishes; choices of nasi kuning or regular steamed rice, accompanied with choices of dishes such as satay, rendang, gado-gado grilled chicken rica, red snapper in yellow acar sauce, fried shrimp in sambal, potato perkedel and tempeh, also with kerupuk or rempeyek crackers.

<text>Castlepollard ( or &quot;Cionn Toirc&quot;) is a village in north County Westmeath, Ireland. It lies west of Lough Lene and northeast of Lough Derravaragh and Mullingar.

==Name==
The name &quot;Castlepollard&quot; comes from the name of a castle or fortified manor built by the English army captain Nicholas Pollard in the early 17th century. The village&#x27;s official Irish name is &quot;Baile na gCros&quot; (anglicised &quot;Ballinagross&quot;), meaning &quot;town of the cross (or crossroads&quot;. However, the name &quot;Cionn Toirc&quot; (anglicised &quot;Kinturk&quot;), meaning &quot;head of the boar&quot;, has also been applied to the village. The townland of Kinturk Demesne covers the southern part of the village.

==History==
===16th and 17th centuries===
Nicholas Pollard, an English Army captain from Devonshire, arrived in Ireland in 1597 during the Nine Years&#x27; War. He fought under the Earl of Essex&#x27;s command against the Gaelic Irish forces. After that campaign, Captain Pollard was settled on land in the Mayne area. Cionn Torc (Kinturk), a valley between the lakes, was granted &#x27;in capite&#x27; by the ageing Queen Elizabeth I to Captain Pollard. He built a small castle at Rathyoung which he called Castle Pollard.

Walter Pollard, first son of Nicholas, married Ismay Nugent of Roscommon. He received a regrant of the demesne during the restoration period, following the Civil War and Cromwellian confiscations. The grant was made by charter from King Charles II, and approved by the Irish Parliament. In addition, he was granted a permit for a weekly market and a fair which was held four times annually. The Pollard family was reconfirmed in the manorial title by the edict of William and Mary. Serving as Commissioner for Supplies during the War of the Three Kingdoms, Pollard sat in the Irish Parliament, and became High Sheriff of the county in 1692. The family gradually improved the residence and the estate. They rebuilt the adjoining out buildings and developed the village of Castlepollard. They intermarried with the Dillon family of Ladyhill, the Pakenhams, the Duttons, the Tuites, and other landed county families. The descendants of Nicholas Pollard lived at Kinturk into the early twentieth century.

===Castlepollard Massacre, 1831===

On 23 May 1831 members of the paramilitary Royal Irish Constabulary force (which Britain established to police Ireland) arrested a man following a fight at Castlepollard&#x27;s fair. The crowd surrounded them until they released the man. At approximately 5pm that day, members of the same force returned, this time armed with muskets. These RIC members were then allegedly jeered by the crowd. In response, they lined up and fired shots. By the time they had finished 13 people lay dead, and many others were injured. The names of the dead were: Patrick Dignam, Mary Kiernan, John Slevin, Patrick McCormack, Brian Mahon, Tomas Kiernan, Patrick McDermott, Patrick McDonagh, Mary Neill, James Fagan, Patrick Keegan, Patrick Ledwich and Peggy Leary. 19 police officers were sent to Mullingar jail but at their hearing in Mullingar in July 1831 all 19 were discharged without conviction.

This incident may have been related to the enforcement of collection orders during the Tithe War (1831–1836). Spasmodic violence broke out around this time (particularly in Kilkenny, Wexford, and Cork) when the police entered local fairgrounds to enforce seizure orders on cattle for non-payment of tithes. Order was finally restored by rescinding seizure orders in 1836. The subsequent revision of the Tithe Act commuted the levy. The Church of Ireland was disestablished by the Gladstone government in 1869, and the tithe was abolished.

===Built heritage===
The original village layout, much of which dates to the 19th century, is preserved and now landscaped in a central triangular green. Surrounded by buildings from the Georgian period, a sculpture on the square depicts a scene from the locally centred legend of the Children of Lir. A plaque outlines the story in several languages. The setting of the legend is Lough Derravaragh. There are several ringforts on the surrounding high ground. Two ancient forts are of archaeological interest. Randoon is located in nearby Ranaghan, south west of Lough Lene, and Turgesius Island, is situated on Lough Lene. Turgesius was a Viking leader who sojourned here with a local lover while on respite from his seafaring. He held sway in Danish Dublin (Dyflin) and Shannon Viking port near Clonmacnoise.

Castlepollard has two churches which serve the Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland Christian communities. Kinturk House, the Georgian period Pollard residence, now serves as St. Peter&#x27;s Centre. It was purchased by the Sacred Heart Sisters from the family in 1935, who added a chapel wing. A hospital designed by T.J. Cullen (1879–1947) was built c. 1935 and was part of &quot;an extensive hospital construction programme initiated during the first decades of the Irish Free State&quot; financed by the Irish Hospitals&#x27; Sweepstake. The sisters operated a Mother and Baby home there for many years; the property was sold to Midlands Health Board in 1971.
In the early nineteenth century, the main village and the Pollard family properties underwent a reconstruction program. The Kinturk Demesne residence and the adjacent buildings were rebuilt in the Georgian style of the period. Some common lands were enclosed. A new Church of Ireland building was erected in the Square, along with the Market house Located on the west side of the green, this was the village&#x27;s major public building and landmark. The quarterly Court of Petty Sessions convened here.

During the War of Independence the Irish Republican Army (IRA) burned the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) barracks located on the Mullingar Road. The RIC then moved to the courthouse. In 1921, the IRA began a wave of burnings which targeted government offices throughout Ireland. This was a concerted effort to cripple the UK civil service in its day-to-day administration of the country. The Market House was also torched. Two sitting magistrates were kidnapped by the IRA on their way to the court. The men were held hostage locally, reportedly in a cow byre on the Hill of Moal. They were later released unharmed after forty eight hours, and the village was spared reprisals. The Market House was rebuilt in 1926, and served as the village fire station until a purpose-built fire station was constructed. The Market House was also used as the village library for a number of years.

Later additions to the built environment include multiple housing estates, the Area Office of the Westmeath County Council, and the Castlepollard Community College&#x27;s new school building (2004), both on the Mullingar Road.

==Transport==
While Bus Éireann route 111 (Cavan to Dublin via Trim) previously served Castlepollard, this is no longer the case. As of November 2024, route 111a (Cavan to Delvin via Granard) had a stop at Castlepollard. Route 447 also provides a link to Mullingar via Crookedwood on Thursdays only.
The nearest rail service is at Mullingar railway station, approximately 22 km distant.

==Economy==
Mergon International, a manufacturer of moulded parts, is one of the main businesses in the village. The village has number of retail outlets, serving a hinterland covering parts of North Westmeath. This includes filling stations, one bank, a post office, council buildings, primary and secondary schools, a number of grocery/newsagent shops, hairdressers, beauty salon&#x27;s, drapery stores, furniture stores, pharmacies and a hardware store. Castlepollard also has number of pubs.

==Sport==
Hurling is the major sport in the area. Castlepollard is home to the Castlepollard hurling team, who have won the Westmeath Senior Championship on thirteen occasions. Castlepollard are arch-rivals of the neighbouring Lough Lene Gaels of Collinstown.

Ballycomoyle ( away) play in the Junior Gaelic football championship, while Castletown Finea Coole Whitehall (CFCW) ( away) play in the Intermediate championship.

Castlepollard Celtic Football Club, founded in 2004, caters for underage soccer in the area with teams ranging from Under 7&#x27;s to Under 16&#x27;s for boys and girls. In 2013, the club introduced a senior team to the Combined Counties Football League.

==Tullynally Castle==

Two kilometres west of Castlepollard on the Granard Road (Pakenham Hall Street) is Tullynally Castle, seat of the Pakenham family, later the Earls of Longford. Also known as Pakenham Hall, the original 17th-century fortified house (c. 1655) was remodelled first as a Georgian mansion in the 1730s, then as a large Gothic Revival castle. The castle was worked on by several well-known architects in the early-to-mid nineteenth-century, including Francis Johnston, James Shiel and Sir Richard Morrison.

A number of other structures are located on the grounds, including the gate lodge which fronts the Granard Road facing Castlepollard. The two-storey limestone building was designed by Shiel (a former clerk of Francis Johnston) whilst making renovations on the main house. An integral Tudor Gothic-arched carriage arch to the centre of the main body of the building and a single-bay three-storey tower on polygonal-plan attached to the north end of the main façade (east) form &quot;a pleasing vista on a main road leading out of Castlepollard from the west and marks the start of a long tree-lined avenue to Tullynally Castle itself&quot;. It is currently in use as private residence.

The gardens, like the castle, are on a large scale, covering nearly . Terraced lawns around the castle overlook 18th century parkland. The adjoining woodland gardens and walled gardens date largely from the early 19th century and encompass a grotto of eroded limestone from nearby Lough Derravaragh and two ornamental lakes. The walled gardens have flower borders and an avenue of 200-year-old Irish yews. The gardens are open to the public in the spring and summer.

<text>West Wycombe Park is a country house built between 1740 and 1800 near the village of West Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, England. It was conceived as a pleasure palace for the 18th-century libertine and Sir Francis Dashwood, 2nd Baronet. The house is a long rectangle with four façades that are columned and pedimented, three theatrically so. The house encapsulates the entire progression of British 18th-century architecture from early idiosyncratic Palladian to the Neoclassical, although anomalies in its design make it architecturally unique. The mansion is set within an 18th-century landscaped park containing many small temples and follies, which act as satellites to the greater temple, the house.

The house, a Grade I listed building, was given to the National Trust in 1943 by Sir John Dashwood, 10th Baronet (1896–1966), an action strongly resented by his heir. Dashwood retained ownership of the surrounding estate and the contents of the house, most of which he sold; after his death, the house was restored at the expense of his son, the 11th Baronet. Today, while the structure is owned by the National Trust, the house is still the home of the Dashwood family. The house is open to the public during the summer months and is a venue for civil weddings and corporate entertainment, which help to fund its maintenance and upkeep.

==Architecture==

===Ethos===


West Wycombe Park, architecturally inspired by the villas of the Veneto constructed during the late-Renaissance period, is not one of the largest, grandest or best-known of England&#x27;s many country houses. Compared to its Palladian contemporaries, such as Holkham Hall, Woburn Abbey and Ragley Hall, it is quite small, yet it is architecturally important as it encapsulates a period of 18th-century English social history, when young men, known as dilettanti, returning from the Grand Tour with newly purchased acquisitions of art, often built a country house to accommodate their collections and display in stone the learning and culture they had acquired on their travels.

The West Wycombe estate was acquired by Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet, and his brother Samuel in 1698. Dashwood demolished the existing manor house and built a modern mansion on higher ground nearby. This mansion forms the core of the present house. Images of the house on early estate plans show a red-brick house with stone dressings and a hipped roof in the contemporary Queen Anne style. In 1724, Dashwood bequeathed this square conventional house to his 16-year-old son, the 2nd Baronet, also Francis, who later inherited the title Baron le Despencer through his mother and is perhaps best known for establishing the Hellfire Club close to the mansion, in the West Wycombe Caves. Between 1726 and 1741, Dashwood embarked on a series of Grand Tours: the ideas and manners he learned during this period influenced him throughout his life and were pivotal in the rebuilding of his father&#x27;s simple house, transforming it into the classical edifice that exists today.
West Wycombe has been described as &quot;one of the most theatrical and Italianate mid-18th century buildings in England&quot;. Of all the 18th-century country houses, its façades replicate in undiluted form not only the classical villas of Italy on which Palladianism was founded, but also the temples of antiquity on which Neoclassicism was based. The Greek Doric of the house&#x27;s west portico is the earliest example of the Greek revival in Britain.

The late 18th century was a period of change in the interior design of English country houses. The Baroque concept of the principal floor, or &quot;piano nobile&quot;, with a large bedroom suite known as the state apartments, was gradually abandoned in favour of smaller, more private bedrooms on the upper floors. The principal floor became a series of reception rooms, each with a designated purpose, creating separate withdrawing, dining, music, and ballrooms. In the late-18th century, it became common to arrange reception and public rooms on a lower floor, with bedrooms and more private rooms above.

===Exterior===
The builder of West Wycombe, Sir Francis Dashwood, 2nd Baronet, employed at least three architects and two landscape architects in the design of the house and its grounds. He had an input himself: having made the Grand Tour and seen the villas of the Italian Renaissance first hand, he wished to emulate them.

Work began in about 1735 and continued until Dashwood&#x27;s death in 1781, when the older house had been transformed inside and out. The long building time partly explains the flaws and variations in design: when building commenced, Palladianism was the height of fashion, but by the time of its completion, Palladianism had been succeeded by Neoclassicism; thus, the house is a marriage of both styles. While the marriage is not completely unhappy, the Palladian features are marred by the lack of Palladio&#x27;s proportions: the east portico is asymmetrical with the axis of the house, and trees were planted either side to draw the eye away from the flaw.

The finest architects of the day submitted plans to transform the older family house into a modern architectural extravaganza. Among them Robert Adam, who submitted a plan for the west portico, but his idea was dropped. The architect Nicholas Revett was consulted and created the west portico. Today, the first sight of the house as approached from the drive is this west end of the house, which appears as a Grecian temple. The eight-columned portico, inspired by the Temple of Bacchus in Teos was completed by 1770, and is considered to be the earliest example of Greek revival architecture in Britain. The opposite (east) end of the house, designed by Roger Morris and completed c. 1755, appears equally temple-like, but this time the muse was the Villa Rotunda in Vicenza. Thus the two opposing porticos, east and west, illustrate two architectural styles of the late-18th century: the earlier Roman inspired Palladian architecture and the more Greek inspired Neoclassicism.

The principal façade is the great south front, a two-storey colonnade of Corinthian columns superimposed on Tuscan, the whole surmounted by a central pediment. The columns are not stone, but wood coated in stucco. It is possible this facade was inspired by work done in Paris on the church of S. Sulpice by Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni who was working in England from 1747 to 1751; some drawings made for Sir Francis Dashwood in emulation of his uncle&#x27;s patronage of Palladian style, survive by him in the collection at West Wycombe. The executant architect for this elevation and for much of the work on the house appears to have been the minor architectural view painter John Donowell, who worked between 1761 and 1763 (although he had to wait until 1775 for payment).

The façade, which has similarities to the main façade of Palladio&#x27;s Palazzo Chiericati of 1550, was originally the entrance front. The front door is still in the centre of the ground floor leading into the main entry hall. This is a substantial deviation from the classical form of English Palladianism in which the main entrance and principal rooms would be on the first floor reached by an outer staircase, giving the main reception rooms elevated views, with the ground floor given over to service rooms. Such a radical re-arrangement was not possible here since the house was a partial rebuild rather than a wholly new structure.

The more severe north front is of eleven bays, with the end bays given significance by rustication at ground floor level. The centre of the façade has Ionic columns supporting a pediment and originally had the Dashwood coat of arms. This façade is thought to date from around 1750–51, although its segmented windows suggest it was one of the first of the 2nd Baronet&#x27;s improvements to the original house to be completed, as the curved or segmented window heads are symbolic of the earlier part of the 18th century; the design has been given to Isaac Ware.

===Interior===
The principal reception rooms are on the ground floor with large sash windows opening immediately into the porticos and the colonnades, and therefore onto the gardens, a situation unheard of in the grand villas and palaces of Renaissance Italy. The mansion contains a series of 18th century salons decorated and furnished in the style of that period, with polychrome marble floors, and painted ceilings depicting classical scenes of Greek and Roman mythology. Of particular note is the entrance hall, which resembles a Roman atrium with marbled columns and a painted ceiling copied from Robert Wood&#x27;s &quot;Ruins of Palmyra&quot;.

Many of the reception rooms have painted ceilings copied from Italian palazzi, most notably from the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. The largest room in the house is the Music Room, which opens onto the east portico. The ceiling fresco in this room depicts the &quot;Banquet of the Gods&quot; and was copied from the Villa Farnesina. The Saloon, which occupies the centre of the north front, contains many marbles, including statuettes of the four seasons. The ceiling depicting &quot;The Council of the Gods and the Admission of Psyche&quot; is also a copy from Villa Farnesina.

The Dining Room walls are painted faux jasper and hold paintings of the house&#x27;s patron—Sir Francis Dashwood—and his fellow members of the Divan Club (a society for those who had visited the Ottoman Empire). The room also has a painted ceiling from Wood&#x27;s &quot;Palmyra&quot;.

The Blue Drawing Room is dominated by the elaborate painted ceiling depicting &quot;The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne&quot; (&quot;illustrated left&quot;). This room houses a plaster statuette of the Venus de&#x27; Medici and marks the 2nd Baronet&#x27;s risqué devotion to that goddess of love. The room has walls of blue flock, applied in the 1850s and later renewed, bearing paintings from various Italian schools of the 17th century. The Red Drawing Room is lined in crimson silk and is furnished with marquetry commodes.

The relatively small study contains plans for the house and potential impressions for various elevations. One is reputed to have been drawn by Sir Francis Dashwood himself, while the Tapestry Room, once ante-room to the adjoining former principal bedroom, is hung with Brussels tapestries depicting peasant scenes by Teniers. Dashwood inherited them in 1763 from his uncle Lord Westmorland, who is said to have been given them by the 1st Duke of Marlborough to celebrate their victories in the Low Countries.

==Gardens and park==
The gardens at West Wycombe Park are among the finest and most idiosyncratic 18th century gardens surviving in England. The park is unique in its consistent use of Classical architecture from both Greece and Italy. The principal architect of the gardens was Nicholas Revett, who designed many of the ornamental buildings in the park. The landscape architect Thomas Cook began to execute the plans for the park, with a nine-acre man-made lake created from the nearby River Wye in the form of a swan. The lake originally had a snow (a sailing vessel) for the amusement of Dashwood&#x27;s guests, complete with a resident captain on board. Water leaves the lake down a cascade and into a canal pond.

Georgian English landscape gardens, such as West Wycombe and Stowe, are arranged as a walk or series of walks that take the visitor through a range of locations, each with its own specific character and separate from the last. Planting and the shape of the landscape is used, alongside follies and man-made water features, to create pleasant vistas and set pieces centred on a building, straight avenue, serpentine walk, or viewpoint. In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000 acres (20 km2) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of High Wycombe, and Humphrey Repton completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared much as they do today.

The park still contains many follies and temples. The &quot;Temple of Music&quot; is on an island in the lake, inspired by the Temple of Vesta in Rome. It was designed for Dashwood&#x27;s fêtes champêtres, with the temple used as a theatre; the remains of the stage survive. Opposite the temple is the garden&#x27;s main cascade which has statues of two water nymphs. The present cascade has been remade, as the original was demolished in the 1830s. An octagonal tower known as the &quot;Temple of the Winds&quot; is based in design on the Tower of the Winds in Athens.

Classical architecture continues along the path around the lake, with the &quot;Temple of Flora&quot;, a hidden summerhouse, and the &quot;Temple of Daphne&quot;, both reminiscent of a small temple on the Acropolis. Another hidden temple, the &quot;Round Temple&quot;, has a curved loggia. Nearer the house, screening the service wing from view, is a Roman triumphal arch, the &quot;Temple of Apollo&quot;, also known (because of its former use a venue for cock fighting) as &quot;Cockpit Arch&quot;, which holds a copy of the famed Apollo Belvedere. Close by is the &quot;Temple of Diana&quot;, with a small niche containing a statue of the goddess. Another goddess is celebrated in the &quot;Temple of Venus&quot;. Below this is an Exedra, a grotto (known as Venus&#x27;s Parlour) and a statue of Mercury. This once held a copy of the Venus de&#x27; Medici; it was demolished in the 1820s but was reconstructed in the 1980s and now holds a replica of the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;.

Later structures that break the classical theme include the Gothic style boathouse, a Gothic Alcove – now a romantic ruin hidden amongst undergrowth – and a Gothic Chapel, once home of the village cobbler (and facetiously named St Crispin&#x27;s) but later used as the estate kennels. A monument dedicated to Queen Elizabeth II was erected on her 60th birthday in 1986.

The gardens are listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==Dashwoods of West Wycombe==

Sir Francis Dashwood built West Wycombe to entertain, and there has been much speculation on the kind of entertainment he provided for his guests. Judged against the sexual morals of the late 18th century, Dashwood and his clique were regarded as promiscuous; while it is likely that the contemporary reports of the bacchanalian orgies over which Dashwood presided in the Hellfire caves above West Wycombe were exaggerated, free love and heavy drinking did take place there. Dashwood often had himself depicted in portraits in fancy dress (in one, dressed as St Francis of Assisi toasting a statue of Venus), and it is his love of fancy dress which seems to have pervaded through to his parties at West Wycombe Park. Following the dedication of the West portico as the temple of Bacchus in 1771, Dashwood and his friends dressed in skins adorned with vine leaves and went to party by the lake for &quot;Paeans and libations&quot;. On another occasion, during a mock sea battle on the canal, the captain of the snow, &quot;attacking&quot; a battery constructed on the bank, was struck by the wadding of a gun and suffered an internal injury. Dashwood later devoted more of his time to political reform and to charitable works; he had an active political career all of his adult life; a serious occupation belied by his reputation for revelry. He died in 1781, bequeathing West Wycombe to his half-brother Sir John Dashwood-King, 3rd Baronet.

Dashwood-King spent little time at West Wycombe. On his death in 1793, the estate was inherited by his son Sir John Dashwood, 4th Baronet, Member of Parliament for Wycombe and a friend of the Prince of Wales, although their friendship was tested when Sir John accused his wife of an affair with the prince. Like his father, Sir John cared little for West Wycombe and held a five-day sale of West Wycombe&#x27;s furniture in 1800. In 1806, he was prevented from selling West Wycombe by the trustees of his son, to whom the estate was entailed. He became religious in the last years of his life, holding ostentatiously teetotal parties in West Wycombe&#x27;s gardens in aid of the &quot;Friends of Order and Sobriety&quot; – these would have been vastly different from the bacchanalian fêtes given by his uncle in the grounds. In 1847, Sir John was bankrupt and bailiffs possessed the furniture from his home at Halton. He died estranged from his wife and surviving son in 1849.

Sir John was succeeded by his estranged son Sir George Dashwood, 5th Baronet. For the first time since the death of the 2nd Baronet in 1781, West Wycombe became again a favoured residence. However, the estate was heavily in debt and Sir George was forced to sell the unentailed estates, including Halton, which was sold in 1851 to Lionel de Rothschild for the then huge sum of £54,000 (£ in 2025). The change in the Dashwoods&#x27; fortunes allowed for the refurbishment and restoration of West Wycombe. Sir George died childless in 1862, and left his wife, Elizabeth, a life tenancy of the house while the title and ownership passed briefly to his brother and then a nephew. Lady Dashwood&#x27;s continuing occupation of the house prevented the nephew, Sir Edwin Hare Dashwood, 7th Baronet, an alcoholic sheep farmer in the South Island of New Zealand, from living in the mansion until she died in 1889, leaving a neglected and crumbling estate.

The 7th Baronet&#x27;s son, Sir Edwin Dashwood, 8th Baronet, arrived from New Zealand to claim the house, only to find Lady Dashwood&#x27;s heirs claiming the house&#x27;s contents and family jewellery, which they subsequently sold. As a consequence, Sir Edwin was forced to mortgage the house and estate in 1892. He died suddenly the following year, and the heavily indebted estate passed to his brother, Sir Robert Dashwood, 9th Baronet. Sir Robert embarked on a costly legal case against the executors of Lady Dashwood, which he lost, and raised money by denuding the estate&#x27;s woodlands and leasing the family town house in London for 99 years. On his death in 1908, the house passed to his 13-year-old son Sir John Dashwood, 10th Baronet, who in his adulthood sold much of the remaining original furnishings (including the state bed, for £58 – this important item of the house&#x27;s history complete with its gilded pineapples is now lost). In 1922, he attempted to sell the house itself. He received only one offer, of £10,000 (£ in 2025), so the house was withdrawn from sale. Forced to live in a house he disliked, the village of West Wycombe was sold in its entirety to pay for renovations. Not all these renovations were beneficial: painted 18th century ceilings were overpainted white, and the dining room was divided into service rooms, allowing the large service wing to be abandoned to rot.

A form of salvation for West Wycombe was Sir John&#x27;s wife: Lady Dashwood, the former Helen Eaton, a Canadian and sister of American novelist Evelyn Eaton, was a socialite who loved entertaining, and did so in some style at West Wycombe throughout the 1930s. Living a semi-estranged life from her husband, occupying opposite ends of the mansion, she frequently gave &quot;large and stylish&quot; house parties.

During World War II, the house saw service from 1941 onwards as a depository for the evacuated Wallace Collection The collection&#x27;s decorative arts and paintings were housed in the Brown Room, the ballroom and two rooms in the Old Wing. Two wardens slept overnight in the ballroom to protect the artworks, while a four-bedroom cottage on the property was used to house the Wallace&#x27;s staff members. The house also served as a convalescent home, while a troop of gunners occupied the decaying service wing, and the park was used for the inflation of barrage balloons. During this turmoil, the Dashwoods retreated to the upper floor and took in lodgers to pay the bills, albeit very superior lodgers, who included Nancy Mitford and James Lees-Milne, who was secretary of the Country House Committee of the National Trust and instrumental in the Trust&#x27;s acquisition of many such houses. In 1943, Sir John gave the house and grounds to the National Trust, on condition that he and his descendants could continue living in the house.

==West Wycombe after 1943==

In the latter half of the 20th century, Sir Francis Dashwood, 11th Baronet, embarked on a program of restoration and improvement. His efforts included the installation of a huge equestrian sculpture as the focal point of a long tree lined vista from the house. On close inspection, it proves to be a fibre glass prop found at Pinewood Studios by the 11th Baronet who paid for it with 12 bottles of champagne. The local planning authority was furious but lost their lawsuit to have it removed. Today, from a distance, it has been &quot;known to fool experts&quot;.

The present head of the Dashwood family is Sir Edward Dashwood (born 1964), who is married and has three children. The contents of the house are owned by the family, who also own and run the estate. The house can be hired as a filming location, and, in addition to agricultural and equestrian enterprises, there is a large pheasant shoot with paying guns. The park, a natural amphitheatre, is often the setting for large public concerts and firework displays, and the mansion is available for weddings and corporate entertainment.

While the estate remains in private hands, the National Trust owns the house and gardens, the park, the village of West Wycombe, and the hill on which the Dashwood mausoleum sits. The hill was the first part of the property given to the Trust by Sir John Dashwood in 1925. The village was bought by the Royal Society of Arts from Sir John in 1929 and given to the Trust five years later. The grounds are open to the public in the afternoon only from April to August annually, and the house is open from June to August.

<text>An outhouse — known variously across the English-speaking world otherwise as bog, dunny, long-drop, or privy — is a small structure, separate from a main building, which covers a toilet. This is typically either a pit latrine or a bucket toilet, but other forms of dry (non-flushing) toilets may be encountered. The term may also be used to denote the toilet itself, not just the structure.

Outhouses were in use in cities of developed countries (e.g. Australia) well into the second half of the twentieth century. They are still common in rural areas and also in cities of developing countries. Outhouses that are covering pit latrines in densely populated areas can cause groundwater pollution.

== Design aspects ==
=== Common features ===
Outhouses vary in design and construction. They are by definition outside the dwelling, and are not connected to plumbing, sewer, or septic system. The World Health Organization recommends they be built a reasonable distance from the house balancing issues of easy access versus that of smell.

The superstructure exists to shelter the user, and also to protect the toilet itself. The primary purpose of the building is for privacy and human comfort, and the walls and roof provide a visual screen and some protection from the elements. The outhouse also has the secondary role of protecting the toilet hole from sudden influxes of rainwater, which would flood the hole and flush untreated wastes into the underlying soils before they can decompose.

Outhouses are commonly humble and utilitarian, made of lumber or plywood. This is especially so they can easily be moved when the earthen pit fills up. Depending on the size of the pit and the amount of use, this can be fairly frequent, sometimes yearly. As pundit &quot;Jackpine&quot; Bob Cary wrote: &quot;Anyone can build an outhouse, but not everyone can build a good outhouse.&quot; Floor plans typically are rectangular or square, but hexagonal outhouses have been built.

The arrangements inside the outhouse vary by culture. In Western societies, many, though not all, have at least one seat with a hole in it, above a small pit. Others, often in more rural, older areas in European countries, simply have a hole with two indents on either side for the user&#x27;s feet. In Eastern societies, there is a hole in the floor, over which the user crouches. A roll of toilet paper is usually available. Old corn cob, leaves, or other types of paper may instead be used.

The decoration on the outhouse door has no standard. The well-known crescent moon on American outhouses was popularized by cartoonists and had a questionable basis in fact. There are authors who claim the practice began during the colonial period as an early &quot;mens&quot;/&quot;ladies&quot; designation for an illiterate populace (the sun and moon being popular symbols for the sexes during those times). Others dismiss the claim as an urban legend. What is certain is that the purpose of the hole is for venting and light and there were a wide variety of shapes and placements employed.

===Toilet types covered by outhouse shelters===
The shelter may cover very different sorts of toilets.

==== Pit latrines ====
An outhouse often provides the shelter for a pit latrine, which collects human feces in a hole in the ground. When properly built and maintained they can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation. When the pit fills to the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location. The management of the fecal sludge removed from the pit is complicated. There are both environment and health risks if not done properly. As of 2013 pit latrines are used by an estimated 1.77 billion people. This is mostly in the developing world as well as in rural and wilderness areas.

==== Bucket toilet ====

Another system is the bucket toilet, consisting of a seat and a portable receptacle (bucket or pail). These may be emptied by their owners into composting piles in the garden (a low-tech composting toilet), or collected by contractors for larger-scale disposal. Historically, this was known as the pail closet; the municipality employed workers, often known as &quot;nightmen&quot; (from night soil), to empty and replace the buckets. This system was associated in particular with the English town of Rochdale, to the extent that it was described as the &quot;Rochdale System&quot; of sanitation. 20th century books report that similar systems were in operation in parts of France and elsewhere in continental Europe.

The system of municipal collection was widespread in Australia; &quot;dunny cans&quot; persisted well into the second half of the twentieth century, see below. In Scandinavia and some other countries, outhouses are built over removable containers that enable easy removal of the waste and enable much more rapid composting in separate piles. A similar system operates in India, where hundreds of thousands of workers engage in manual scavenging, i.e. emptying pit latrines and bucket toilets without any personal protective equipment.

==== Drums and barrels in national parks ====
A variety of systems are used in some national parks and popular wilderness areas, to cope with the increased volume of people engaged in activities such as mountaineering and kayaking. The growing popularity of paddling, hiking, and climbing has created special waste disposal issues throughout the world. It is a dominant topic for outdoor organizations and their members. For example, in some places the human waste is collected in drums which need to be helicoptered in and out at considerable expense.

Alternatively, some parks mandate a &quot;pack it in, pack it out&quot; rule. Many reports document the use of containers for the removal of excrement, which must be packed in and packed out on Mount Everest. Also known as &quot;expedition barrels&quot; or &quot;bog barrels&quot;, the cans are weighed to make sure that groups do not dump them along the way. &quot;Toilet tents&quot; are erected. There has been an increasing awareness that the mountain needs to be kept clean, for the health of the climbers at least.

==== Composting toilets ====

Worm hold privies, another variant of the composting toilet, are being used by Vermont&#x27;s Green Mountain Club. These simple outhouses are stocked with red worms (a staple used by home composters). Composting toilets are also subject to regulations.

The &quot;Clivus Multrum&quot; is another type of composting toilet which can be inside of an outhouse.

==== Others ====
There are other types of toilet that may be covered by an outhouse superstructure, or a toilet tent (e.g. in humanitarian relief operations), or even be installed inside a house that is beyond the reach of sewers. The Swedish Pacto toilet uses a continuous roll of plastic to collect and dispose of waste. Incinerating toilets are installed in several thousand cabins in Norway. These toilets incinerate waste into ashes, using only propane and 12 volt battery electricity.

== Public health issues ==
Outhouse design, placement, and maintenance has long been recognized as being important to the public health. See posters created by the Works Progress Administration during the 1930s and early 1940s.

=== Insect control ===
Some types of flying insects such as the housefly are attracted to the odor of decaying material, and will use it for food for their offspring, laying eggs in the decaying material. Other insects such as mosquitoes seek out standing water that may be present in the pit for the breeding of their offspring.

Both of these are undesirable pests to humans, but can be easily controlled without chemicals by enclosing the top of the pit with tight-fitting boards or concrete, using a sufficiently sealed toilet hole cover that is closed after every use, and by using fine-grid insect screen to cover the inlet and outlet vent holes. This prevents flying insect entry by all potential routes.

It is common (at least in the United States) for outhouses to have a bucket or a bag of powdered lime with a scoop of some kind in it. Either before or after using the outhouse (usually after but sometimes both) a scoop or two of lime is sprinkled into the lid holes to cover the waste as to suppress the odor which also can help with the insect issues. This method of using powdered lime is also used (and for the same reasons) in common/mass graves.

===Parasites===
One of the purposes of outhouses is to avoid spreading parasites such as intestinal worms, notably hookworms, which might otherwise be spread via open defecation.

== Uses ==

=== Outhouses on mountain peaks ===
* On August 29, 2007, the highest outhouse (actually, not a building at all, but a pit toilet surrounded by a low rock wall) in the continental United States, which sat atop Mount Whitney at about above sea level, offering a magnificent panorama to the user, was removed. Two other outhouses, in the Inyo National Forest, were closed due to the expense and danger involved in transporting out large sewage drums via helicopter. The annual 19,000 or so hikers of the Mount Whitney Trail, who must pick up National Forest Service permits, are now given Wagbags (a double-sealed sanitation kit) to facilitate the practice of “pack it in; pack it out.” Solar-powered toilets did not sufficiently compact the excrement, and the systems were judged failures at that location. Additionally, by relieving park rangers of latrine duty, they were better able to concentrate on primary ranger duties such as talking to hikers. The use of Wagbags and the removal of outhouses is part of a larger trend in US parks. The US National Park Service once built an outhouse that cost above $333,000.
* In 2007, France&#x27;s two highest outhouses were helicoptered to the top of Mont Blanc at a height of . The containers from these outhouses are emptied by helicopter. The facilities will serve 30,000 skiers and hikers annually, thus helping to alleviate the deposit of urine and feces that spread down the mountain face with the spring thaw, and turned it into &#x27;Mont Noir&#x27;. More technically, the 2002 book &quot;Le versant noir du mont Blanc&quot; (&quot;The black hillside of Mont Blanc&quot;) exposes problems in conserving the site.
* Upon the Mount Elbrus—Russia&#x27;s highest peak, the highest mountain in all of Europe and topographically dividing Europe from Asia—sits the world&#x27;s &quot;nastiest outhouse&quot; at . It is in the Caucasus Mountains, near the frontier between Georgia and Russia. As one writer opined, &quot;...it does not much feel like Europe when you&#x27;re there. It feels more like Central Asia or the Middle East.&quot; The outhouse is surrounded by and covered in ice, perched off the end of a rock, and with a pipe pouring effluvia onto the mountain. It consistently receives low marks for sanitation and convenience, but is considered to be a unique experience.
* Australia&#x27;s highest outhouse — located at Rawson&#x27;s Pass in the Main Range in Kosciuszko National Park, which each year receives more than 100,000 walkers outside of winter and has a serious human waste management issue, was completed in 2008.
* A stone outhouse in Colca Canyon, Peru, has been claimed to be &quot;the world&#x27;s highest&quot;.

==History==

Old outhouse pits are seen as excellent places for archeological and anthropological excavations, offering up a trove of common objects from the pasta veritable inadvertent time capsulewhich yields historical insight into the lives of the bygone occupants. This is also called privy digging. It is especially common to find old bottles, which seemingly were secretly stashed or trashed, so their content could be privately imbibed. Fossilised feces (coprolites) yield much information about diet and health.

===Australia===

&quot;Dunny&quot; or &quot;dunny can&quot; are Australian words for a toilet, particularly an outhouse. The combinations &quot;dunny paper&quot; and &quot;dunny brush&quot; are commonly encountered. For other uses of the word, see &quot;dunny (disambiguation)&quot;. 

In suburban areas not connected to the sewerage, outhouses were not always built over pits. Instead, these areas utilized a pail closet, where waste was collected into large cans positioned under the toilet seat, to be collected by contractors (or night soil collectors) hired by property owners or the local council. The used cans were replaced with empty, cleaned cans. Brisbane relied on &quot;dunny carts&quot; until the 1950s; because the population was so dispersed, it was difficult to install sewerage. Tar, creosote, and disinfectant kept the smell down. Academic George Seddon claimed that &quot;the typical Australian back yard in the cities and country towns&quot; had, throughout the first half of the twentieth century, &quot;a dunny against the back fence, so that the pan could be collected from the dunny lane through a trap-door&quot;. The person who appeared weekly to empty the buckets beneath the seats was known as the &quot;dunnyman&quot;, see gong farmer.

The &quot;dunny lanes&quot; provided access to collectors. These access lanes can now be worth considerable sums. See ransom strip.

The Great Australian Dunny Race has become an icon during the Weerama Festival at Werribee.

===Denmark===
The remains of a thousand year old Viking outhouse were discovered in 2017. This is the oldest known outhouse in the country, even though evidence cannot establish it to be &quot;the first&quot;. This discovery was considered to be culturally significant.

=== United States ===

Outhouses are typically built on one level, but two-story models are to be found in unusual circumstances. One double-decker was built to serve a two-story building in Cedar Lake, Michigan. The outhouse was connected by walkways. It still stands (but not the building). The waste from &quot;upstairs&quot; is directed down a chute separate from the &quot;downstairs&quot; facility in these instances, so contrary to various jokes about two-story outhouses, the user of the lower level has nothing to fear if the upper level is in use at the same time. The Boston Exchange Coffee House (1809–1818) was equipped with a four-story outhouse with windows on each floor.

Some outhouses were built surprisingly ornately, considering the time and the place. For example, an opulent 19th century antebellum example (a three-holer) is at the plantation area at the state park in Stone Mountain, Georgia. The outhouses of Colonial Williamsburg varied widely, from simple expendable temporary wood structures to high-style brick. Thomas Jefferson designed and had built two brick octagons at his vacation home. Such outhouses are sometimes considered to be overbuilt, impractical and ostentatious, giving rise to the simile &quot;.&quot; That phrase&#x27;s meaning and application is subject to some debate; but (depending upon the country) it has been applied to men, women, or inanimate objects.

With regards to anal cleansing, old newspapers and mail order catalogs, such as those from Montgomery Ward or Sears Roebuck, were common before toilet paper was widely available. The Old Farmer&#x27;s Almanac, manufactured with a hole drilled through it to allow easy hanging on a nail, was popular. Paper was often kept in a can or other container to protect it from mice, etc. The catalogs served a dual purpose, also giving one something to read.

== Society and culture ==

===Names===
Outdoor toilets are referred to by many epithets and terms throughout the English-speaking world varying in levels of politeness and discretion of euphemism to the public taste. The term &quot;outhouse&quot; is used in North American English for the structure over a toilet, usually a pit latrine (&quot;long-drop&quot;). However, in British English &quot;outhouse&quot; means any outbuilding, including such as a shed or barn.

In Australia and parts of Canada an outdoor toilet is known as a &quot;dunny&quot;. &quot;Privy&quot;, an archaic variant of &quot;private&quot;, is used in North America, Scotland, and northern England. &quot;Bog&quot; is common throughout Britain (used to coin the neologism &quot;tree bog&quot;) and is also used informally in Britain, as well as Canada and Australia to refer to any toilet. The name &quot;little house&quot; (as &quot;&quot;) continues as a euphemism for any toilet in both the Welsh language and the Welsh English dialect. Other terms include &quot;back house&quot;, &quot;house of ease&quot;, and &quot;house of office&quot;. The last was common in 17th-century England and appeared in Samuel Pepys&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; on numerous occasions.

A regional name for an outhouse in North America used especially in Virginia is &quot;johnnyhouse&quot; or &quot;johnny house&quot;. In the Scouting Movement in North America, a widespread term for outhouse is &quot;kybo&quot;. This appears to have originated from camps which used Kybo brand coffee cans to hold lye or lime which was sprinkled down the hole to reduce odor. &quot;Keep Your Bowels Open&quot; may be a backronym. Temporary encampments may use a tent or tarpaulin over a shallow pit; one name for this is a &quot;hudo&quot;, acronym of &quot;Houd uw darmen open&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Keep Your Bowels Open&quot;).

In Poland the wooden outdoor toilets are commonly called &quot;Sławojka&quot;, a name that refers to the former Prime Minister Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski who used to monitor scrupulously the implementation of the provisions imposed by the construction law of 1928, making it mandatory for outdoor toilet pits to be surrounded by walls.

=== Mythology ===
Tsi-Ku, also known as Tsi Ku Niang, is described as the Chinese goddess of the outhouse and divination. It is said that a woman could uncover the future by going to the outhouse to ask Tsi-Ku. See toilet god.

=== Regulations ===

==== United States ====
Construction and maintenance of outhouses in the US is subject to state and local governmental restriction, regulation and prohibition. It is potentially both a public health issue, which has been addressed both by law and by education of the public as to good methods and practices (&quot;e.g.&quot;, separation from drinking water sources). This also becomes a more prevalent issue as urban and suburban development encroaches on rural areas, and is an external manifestation of a deeper cultural conflict. &quot;See also&quot; urban sprawl, urban planning, regional planning, suburbanization, urbanization and counterurbanization.

=== Songs, poems and stories ===
* The double-decker outhouse has been used as an unflattering metaphor for &quot;trickle-down economics&quot; and for power dynamics perceived as unfair. Depending on who is depicted on top and below, it is an easy and familiar cartoon.
* On November 10, 2003, a drawing of an outhouse was used by &quot;B.C.&quot; cartoonist Johnny Hart as a motif in a controversial and allegedly religiously themed piece. The cartoonist denied the allegations and the convoluted analysis of the alleged iconography of the cartoon.
* In 1929 comedian Charles &quot;Chic&quot; Sale published a small book, &quot;The Specialist&quot;, which was a large &quot;underground&quot; success. Its entire premise centered on sales of outhouses, touting the advantages of one kind or another, and labeling them in &quot;technical&quot; terms such as &quot;one-holers&quot;, &quot;two-holers&quot;, etc. Over a million copies were sold. In 1931 his monologue &quot;I&#x27;m a Specialist&quot; was made into a hit record (Victor 22859) by recording artist Frank Crumit (music by Nels Bitterman). As memorialized in the &quot;Outhouse Wall of Fame&quot;, the term &quot;Chic Sale&quot; became a rural slang synonym for privies, an appropriation of Mr. Sale&#x27;s name that he personally considered unfortunate. 
* Folk singer Billy Edd Wheeler wrote and performed a song titled &quot;The Little Brown Shack Out Back&quot;, a sentimental look at the outhouse.
* In Newfoundland, a well-known song entitled &quot;Good Old Newfie Outhouse&quot; sings the praises of using the outhouse when it is -25 degrees out, mentioning pleasures like pants being frozen in position at the knees. A version by singer Bobby Evans is available on an album called &quot;Silly Songs&quot; on iTunes.
* A humorous and nostalgic poem entitled &quot;Passing of the Backhouse&quot;, about the disappearance of outhouses in America. It has been attributed to authors including James Whitcomb Riley, an American poet who denied authorship when he became aware of an attribution in 1910.
*The first chapter of John Fitzgerald&#x27;s autobiographical children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Great Brain&quot;, talked of how Utah of the 1890s saw such structures as not only necessary, but as a mark of social status, with the poorest families in town having a two-holed structure to the town mayor owning one with ornate woodwork and heating, and the entire town&#x27;s befuddlement about the Fitzgeralds being the first family to install a flush toilet in their home. Also, the vernacular of such terms was &quot;backhouse&quot;, as the word &quot;outhouse&quot; was used to describe a tool shed or other small building not connected to the main house.

===Races and pranks===
* In Michigan, the Upper Peninsula&#x27;s Trenary has the largest outhouse race, but Mackinaw City is home to an annual and largest &quot;outhouse race south of the Mackinac Bridge&quot;. Other famous outhouse races are during the Yale Bologna Festival and in Dawson City, Yukon.
* As a college student, Richard Nixon achieved renown by providing a three-hole outhouse to be tossed onto the traditional campus bonfire.
*Outhouse tipping, i.e., turning over outhouses, allegedly on Halloween. There is a popular quote from Loretta Lynn&#x27;s memoirs: &quot;We used to go around tipping outhouses over...&quot;

<text>Combined hyperlipidemia (or -aemia) is a commonly occurring form of hypercholesterolemia (elevated cholesterol levels) characterised by increased LDL and triglyceride concentrations, often accompanied by decreased HDL. On lipoprotein electrophoresis (a test now rarely performed) it shows as a hyperlipoproteinemia type IIB. It is the most commonly inherited lipid disorder, occurring in around one in 200 persons. In fact, almost one in five individuals who develop coronary heart disease before the age of 60 have this disorder.

The elevated triglyceride levels (&gt;5 mmol/L) are generally due to an increase in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), a class of lipoproteins prone to cause atherosclerosis.

==Cause==
Hereditary factors are the most common cause.
A diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol increases blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Other disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and hypothyroidism, may promote hypertriglyceridemia.
Certain drugs, such as estrogen, corticosteroids, retinoids, protease inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and beta-blockers, may cause hypertriglyceridemia.
Obesity increases the risk of hyperlipidemia.
Chronic, excessive alcohol use increases the risk of hypertriglyceridemia.
Smoking and not exercising may lead to hyperlipidemia.
Steroid uses, alcoholism, hypothyroidism, oral contraceptives, chronic kidney failure, hypopituitarism, and nephritic syndrome are other contributors to hyperlipidemia.

==Diagnosis==
=== Types ===
The two forms of this lipid disorder are:
* Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) is the familial occurrence of this disorder, probably caused by decreased LDL receptor and increased ApoB.
* Acquired combined hyperlipidemia is extremely common in patients who have other diseases from the metabolic syndrome (&quot;syndrome X&quot;, incorporating diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, central obesity and CH). Excessive free fatty acid production by various tissues leads to increased VLDL synthesis by the liver. Initially, most VLDL is converted into LDL until this mechanism is saturated, after which VLDL levels elevate.

== Treatment ==
Both conditions are treated with fibrate drugs, which act on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARα, to decrease free fatty acid production. Statin drugs, especially the synthetic statins (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin), can decrease LDL levels by increasing hepatic reuptake of LDL due to increased LDL-receptor expression.

<doc id="652508" wikidata="Q5491277" url="?curid=652508" title="Oscar Azócar">
<text>Oscar Gregorio Azócar (February 21, 1965 – June 14, 2010) was a Venezuelan left fielder in Major League Baseball who played for the New York Yankees (1990) and San Diego Padres (1991-&#x27;92). Listed at 6&#x27; 1&quot;, 170 lb., Azócar batted and threw left-handed. In 202 career games, Azócar recorded a batting average of .226 and accumulated 10 stolen bases, and 36 runs batted in (RBI).

==Career==
Azócar was born in Soro, Sucre, Venezuela. After attending high school in Venezuela, he was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent on November 22, 1983.

Until 1987 Azócar posted a record of 14–5 with a 2.30 earned run average as a professional pitcher, but then switched to the outfield. Azócar was a classic example of the impatient hitter who would swing at almost anything and usually put it in play. It took him 100 Major League at-bats to draw his first walk. He normally obliged the pitchers by hitting whatever they threw, and his batting average dropped accordingly.

In a three-season career, Azócar was a .226 hitter (99-for-439) with five home runs and 36 runs batted in in 202 games, including 38 runs scored, 16 doubles, 10 stolen bases and 12 base on balls. Despite his free-swinging style, he had only 36 strikeouts in 439 at-bats (one every 12 at-bats). Azócar also used his speed selectively and never was caught stealing.

==Death==
Azócar died in 2010 in Valencia, Carabobo, at the age of 45 of a heart attack. The same year, he was inducted in the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame for his notable contributions in the Caribbean Series.

<doc id="652517" wikidata="Q156996" url="?curid=652517" title="Bougainvillea">
<text>Bougainvillea ( , ) is a genus of thorny ornamental vines, bushes, and trees belonging to the four o&#x27; clock family, Nyctaginaceae. They are native to Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, and Argentina. There are between 4 and 22 species in the genus. The inflorescence consists of large colourful sepal-like bracts which surround three simple waxy flowers, gaining popularity for the plant as an ornamental. The plant is named after explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville (1729-1811), after it was documented on one of his expeditions.

==Description==

The species grow tall, scrambling over other plants with their spiky thorns. They are evergreen where rainfall occurs all year, or deciduous if there is a dry season. The leaves are alternate, simple ovate-acuminate, long and broad. The actual flower of the plant is small and generally white, but each cluster of three flowers is surrounded by three or six bracts with the bright colours associated with the plant, including pink, magenta, purple, red, orange, white, or yellow. &quot;Bougainvillea glabra&quot; is sometimes called &quot;paper flower&quot; because its bracts are thin and papery. The fruit is a narrow five-lobed achene.

==History==
The first European to describe these plants was Philibert Commerçon, a botanist accompanying French Navy admiral Louis Antoine de Bougainville during his voyage of circumnavigation of the Earth, and first published by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789.
Twenty years after Commerçon&#x27;s description, it was first published as &#x27;Buginvillæa&#x27; in Genera Plantarum by A. L. de Jussieu in 1789. The genus was subsequently spelled in several ways until it was finally established as &quot;Bougainvillea&quot; in the Index Kewensis in the 1930s. Originally, &quot;B. spectabilis&quot; and &quot;B. glabra&quot; were undifferentiated until the mid-1980s when botanists classified them as distinct species. In the early 19th century, these two species were the first to be introduced into Europe, and soon nurseries in France and Britain sold these varieties in Australia and throughout their former colonies. Meanwhile, Kew Gardens distributed plants it had propagated to British colonies throughout the world. Soon thereafter, a crimson specimen in Cartagena, Colombia was added to the genus descriptions. Originally thought to be a distinct species, it was named &quot;B. buttiana&quot; in honour of the European who first encountered it. However, later studies classified it as a natural hybrid of a variety of &quot;B. glabra&quot; and possibly &quot;B. peruviana&quot;—a &quot;local pink bougainvillea&quot; from Peru. Natural hybrids were soon found to be common occurrences all over the world. For instance, around the 1930s, when the three species were grown together, many hybrid crosses were produced almost spontaneously in East Africa, India, the Canary Islands, Australia, North America, and the Philippines.

==Cultivation and uses==

Bougainvillea are popular ornamental plants in most areas with warm climates, including Florida, South Carolina, South India, California, across the Mediterranean Basin.

Although it is frost-sensitive and hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 9b and 10, bougainvillea can be used as a houseplant or hanging basket in cooler climates. In the landscape, it makes an excellent hot season plant, and its drought tolerance makes it ideal for warm climates year-round. Its high salt tolerance makes it a natural choice for colour in coastal regions. It can be pruned into a standard, but is also grown along fence lines, on walls, in containers and hanging baskets, and as a hedge or an accent plant. Its long arching thorny branches bear heart-shaped leaves and masses of papery bracts in white, pink, orange, purple, and burgundy. Many cultivars, including double-flowered and variegated, are available.

Many bougainvillea today are the result of interbreeding among only three out of the eighteen South American species recognised by botanists. There are over 300 varieties of bougainvillea. Because many of the hybrids have been crossed over several generations, it is difficult to identify their respective origins. Natural mutations seem to occur spontaneously throughout the world; wherever large numbers of plants are being produced, bud-sports will occur. This had led to multiple names for the same cultivar (or variety) and has added to the confusion over the names of bougainvillea cultivars.

The growth rate of bougainvillea varies from slow to rapid, depending on the variety. They tend to flower all year round in equatorial regions. Elsewhere, they are seasonal, with bloom cycles typically four to six weeks. Bougainvillea grow best in dry soil, in very bright full sun and with frequent fertilisation; but they require little water once established, and in fact will not flourish if over-watered. They can be easily propagated via tip cuttings.

&quot;Bougainvillea&quot; is also a very attractive genus for Bonsai enthusiasts, due to their ease of training and their radiant flowering during the spring. They can be kept as indoor houseplants in temperate regions and kept small by bonsai techniques.

&quot;B.&quot; × &quot;buttiana&quot; is a garden hybrid of &quot;B. glabra&quot; and &quot;B. peruviana&quot;. It has produced numerous garden-worthy cultivars.

The cultivars &#x27;San Diego Red&#x27; and &#x27;Mary Palmer&#x27;s Enchantment&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 
&quot;Bougainvillea&quot; are relatively pest-free plants, but they may be susceptible to worms, snails and aphids. The larvae of some Lepidoptera species also use them as food plants, for example the giant leopard moth (&quot;Hypercompe scribonia&quot;).
==Symbolism and nomenclature==

Various species of &quot;Bougainvillea&quot; are the official flowers of Guam (where it is known as the &quot;Puti Tai Nobiu&quot;); Lienchiang and Pingtung Counties in Taiwan; Ipoh, Malaysia; the cities of Tagbilaran, Philippines; Camarillo, California; Laguna Niguel, California; San Clemente, California; the cities of Shenzhen, Huizhou, Zhuhai, and Jiangmen in Guangdong Province, China; Xiamen, Fujian and Naha, Okinawa. Is also the national flower in Grenada.

Native to South America, bougainvillea carry several names in the different regions where they are present. Apart from Rioplatense Spanish &quot;santa-rita&quot;, Colombian Spanish &quot;veranera&quot;, Peruvian Spanish &quot;papelillo&quot;, it may be variously named &quot;primavera&quot;, &quot;três-marias&quot;, &quot;sempre-lustrosa&quot;, &quot;santa-rita&quot;, &quot;ceboleiro&quot;, &quot;roseiro&quot;, &quot;roseta&quot;, &quot;riso&quot;, &quot;pataguinha&quot;, &quot;pau-de-roseira&quot; and &quot;flor-de-papel&quot; in Brazilian Portuguese. Nevertheless, in Portuguese and in Spanish are the most common names accepted by people of the regions where these languages are spoken but it is an introduced plant.

==Toxicity==
The sap of bougainvillea can cause serious skin rashes, similar to &quot;Toxicodendron&quot; species.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
As of 2010, &quot;Bougainvillea&quot; is generally placed in the &quot;Bougainvilleeae&quot; subtribe (containing three genera) of the &quot;Nyctaginaceae&quot; tribe with &quot;Pisonieae&quot; being a sister subtribe (containing four genera):

===Species===
According to the Catalogue of Life, there are 16 species of &quot;Bougainvillea&quot;.

<text>The Heuneburg is a prehistoric Celtic hillfort by the river Danube in Hundersingen near Herbertingen, between Ulm and Sigmaringen, Baden-Württemberg, in the south of Germany, close to the modern borders with Switzerland and Austria. It is considered to be one of the most important early Celtic centres in Central Europe, particularly during the Iron Age Hallstatt culture period. Apart from the fortified citadel, there are extensive remains of settlements and burial areas spanning several centuries.

The fortified citadel measures about . It stood on a strategically positioned mountain spur that rises steeply above the Danube. It is at the centre of a fertile river plain, surrounded by rolling hill country. During the Iron Age the Heuneburg is thought to have controlled a surrounding area of over including other hilltop settlements, hamlets, villages, roads, cemeteries and cult or gathering places.

The settlement has been called &quot;oldest city north of the alps&quot;, and has been identified with the Celtic city of Pyrene mentioned by Herodotus.

==Discovery and excavations==
The site was first noted in the 1820s. In 1882, recognised its importance and correctly identified it as a prehistoric fortification. He misidentified the lower fortifications as medieval. Some of the nearby burial mounds were opened in the 19th century.

Sporadic excavation on the citadel began in the 1920s. In the 1930s, the Hohmichele mound was examined (see below). A systematic excavation programme took place from 1950 to 1979, directed successively by , Kurt Bittel, and .

Since 2003, the Heuneburg is one of the foci of a multi-disciplinary research project on early Celtic centres undertaken by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. New excavations began in 2004.

==History==

Although best known for its role as an important early Celtic centre from the 7th to 5th centuries BC, the Heuneburg was occupied at several other points during its history.

The first settlement on the site dates to the Middle Bronze Age (15th to 12th century BC) during the Tumulus culture period. At this time, the main plateau was fortified with a massive ditch-and-bank enclosure, including a wooden wall. The settlement was abandoned at the beginning of the Urnfield period. This abandonment apparently did not entail a violent destruction. During the Urnfield period, there was a burial area in the location of the later &quot;Südsiedlung&quot; (see below).

The citadel was reoccupied and refortified around 700 BC; adjacent areas were occupied at the same time, including Alte Burg and &quot;Grosse Heuneburg&quot;. The Heuneburg complex developed briskly, and by 600 BC, it was one of the key centres of power and trade in Celtic/Halstatt Southern Germany. Major changes in internal structure occurred around that time. Before 500 BC, the site suffered a major destruction, followed by a second flourish and a further destruction in the 5th century BC. It used to be assumed that the Heuneburg was abandoned by the La Tène period, but recent evidence does not fully support this view.
The conjunction of a prominent fortified site, elaborate burials, specialised craft production and trade of valuable imported goods class the Heuneburg with a small group of similar important early Celtic sites, the so-called &quot;Fürstensitze&quot; (see below).

The strategic location of the Heuneburg led to some activity in the Middle Ages, although no permanent occupation occurred at that time.

==The Celtic citadel==
The main plateau on the mountain spur, 40m above the Danube and naturally defensible, was the centre of high-status occupation and of fortification in Celtic periods. It measures only but is the main visual landmark in the area. From c. 700 BC onwards, it was the centre of a large settlement.

The main settlement on the citadel underwent several changes during its existence. As the houses were built of wood and daub, and the fortifications mostly of wood and earth, they were replaced frequently. This resulted in over a dozen identifiable occupation phases, representing at least 250 years of activity.

The plateau was refortified from c. 700 BC onwards. Originally, the fortification took the form of a classic Celtic wood-and-earth wall (&quot;murus gallicus&quot;), replaced regularly.

Around 600 BC, this was replaced by a structure without parallel in contemporary Celtic Europe. A limestone foundation supported a sun-dried mudbrick wall of c. height, probably topped by a roofed walkway, thus reaching a total height of 6 m. The wall was clad with bright white lime plaster, regularly renewed; this was necessary to prevent the northern weather from eroding the unbaked mudbrick. Towers protruded outwards from the wall at intervals. It must have been widely visible in the area, as the modern reconstruction of a section is. No other mudbrick structures are known from Celtic Central Europe at this time. It is generally accepted that this structure imitated contemporary walls in the Mediterranean region.

The wall lasted c. 70 years (much longer than its wood-and-earth predecessors and successors which had to be renewed frequently). After a fiery destruction around 530 BC, the settlement was defended by a &quot;murus gallicus&quot; again until a further destruction in the 5th century.

The fortification had two monumental gates, one to the west, giving access to the outer settlements, and another to the east, probably to a steep road leading directly to the Danube (and perhaps a harbour).

The citadel contained a regular system of streets and houses. It appears that the settlement underwent a major reorganisation after 600 BC, after which the dwellings were much more densely and regularly spaced than before. At all times, the Heuneburg houses are of remarkably large size and elaboration compared to contemporary settlements. The uniform buildings probably served as dwellings and workshops. There is evidence for an active metal industry, including a bronze workshop in the southeast corner of the citadel.
After the 530 BC destruction of the mudbrick wall, the internal arrangements underwent some changes. The workshops were moved to the north. A very large house () was built in the southeast corner. This is sometimes interpreted as a &quot;Herrenhaus&quot;, i.e. the dwelling of a local ruler.

The Heuneburg yielded many finds marking it as a rich site, operating both as a local centre of production and as a hub for long-distance trade. These included a full bronze workshop, a high proportion of Greek vases (in fact, the fragments make up about a dozen Greek pots, indicating a larger amount than contemporary sites but also a very limited elite access to such material), and other imported raw materials like tin and amber. Much of the exotic material dates from after 530 BC. There was also a local tradition of producing painted and decorated (incised or stamped) pottery.

==Settlements outside the citadel==
Recent work in and around the Heuneburg has produced groundbreaking information regarding the full extent of the settlement. It now appears that the citadel was only a small, if focal, part of the overall complex at most times.

===The &quot;Aussensiedlung&quot; ===
The &quot;Aussensiedlung&quot; () was located downslope, immediately to the west and northwest of the citadel. It was probably occupied from the 7th century (Hallstatt period) to the 5th century BC. It appears to have existed as a separate fortified settlement.
The &quot;Aussensiedlung&quot; covered up to 100 hectares, many times the area of the citadel proper. It appears to have consisted of separate fenced or palisaded lots, each containing a main dwelling, storage areas and much terrain for fields. It is suggested that each of the lots functioned as a separate farmstead, supporting an extended family.
A population of 5,000 to 10,000 individuals is estimated just for the &quot;Aussensiedlung&quot;. The area enclosed could never have sufficed to produce the amounts of food necessary to feed such a population.
The Giessübel mounds (see below) are erected on top of the remains of part of the &quot;Aussensiedlung&quot; and must thus postdate it.

===The &quot;Südsiedlung&quot; ===
The &quot;Südsiedlung&quot; (&quot;south settlement&quot;) further south appears to have been similar to the &quot;Aussensiedlung&quot; in character and chronology and may indeed have been contiguous with it.

===&quot;Vorwerke&quot; (lower fortifications)===
The huge fortifications recognised in the 19th century, but then misinterpreted as medieval, are also part of the Celtic complex. They have been partially obliterated by erosion and ploughing. A triple system of several hundred metres of banks and ditches enclosed and subdivided the lower terrain just west of the Heuneburg proper. Since they partially overlay the &quot;Aussensiedlung&quot; houses, the walls must have been erected in a later phase. They survive to a height of over 6 m; the ditches were originally deep.

====The gate====
Recent excavations have revealed a monumental gate in the westernmost wall. Measuring , it was a massive construction. Its walls had a core of limestone set in a fine clay mortar, and were faced on each side with fine limestone ashlar masonry. Like the mudbrick wall on the citadel, this feature is exceptional in the Celtic world and resembles contemporary Mediterranean architecture.

==Iron Age cemeteries==
Several burial areas surround the Heuneburg. They consist of clusters of earthen tumuli or burial mounds. More than 50 such monuments are known in the area. Not all have been excavated. Some date from the Hallstatt period, but most are probably La Tène.
The relationship between prominent fortified sites and elaborate burials is also known from other important Celtic centres, like Glauberg oppidum and grave, the Hochdorf Grave near the Hohenasperg settlement and the Vix grave near Mont Lassois.

===Giessübel===
The Giessübel cemetery is located northwest of the Heuneburg. It was built on top of the then abandoned west part of the &quot;Aussensiedlung&quot;. By the 19th century, four mounds remained here, each measuring c. in diameter and in height. First excavations were undertaken in the 19th century (mounds 2 and 3), but more systematic work took place between the 1950s and 1980s.

====Grave 1====
This mound contained a rectangular wooden chamber (). Its main occupant was a man aged around 50. There were also remains of two women. It had been robbed in antiquity, but modern archeological finds nevertheless included weapons, gold and bronze attachments for garments, and some amber plaques that probably once adorned a kline (couch) imported from the Mediterranean. Twenty further burials were later placed in and on the same mound.

====Grave 4====
Grave 4, also robbed, contained a single individual, accompanied by the remains of metal attachments from a wooden chariot.

===Hohmichele===
A cluster or necropolis of burial mounds, the so-called &quot;Hohmichele Group&quot;, is located west of the Heuneburg. It consists of at least 36 burial mounds. The group is named after its largest mound, the &quot;Hohmichele&quot;. It is located near Altheim (Biberach district). Most of the mounds are not visible any more due to natural erosion and ploughing. The 14 or so that remain are located in forests.

====Excavation====
The first excavation of the main Hohmichele mound took place from 1936 to 1938, directed by Gustav Riek as part of the research programme of the &quot;SS-Ahnenerbe&quot;. Only about a third of the mound was removed during that project; the central burial chamber was located. After the war, from 1954 to 1956, Siegwalt Schiek undertook further excavations.

====The Hohmichele mound====
With a diameter of and a height of over , the Hohmichele is one of the largest Celtic tumuli in Europe. Excavation has mainly concentrated on its central and eastern portions. The mound was used from the late 7th to the late 6th century BC. 13 burials were located within the mound, several of them accompanied by grave offerings.
The mound was restored to its original dimensions in 1960. Today, it is visible as a vegetation-covered landmark in a small forest clearing. A modern war memorial is located on its summit.

====Grave I====
The centre of the mound contained an oak-built main chamber (Grave I), built on the original ground level. It measured and was c. high. This grave, containing a man and a woman, had already been plundered shortly after the burial. The remaining finds, reflecting its original riches include horse trappings, nearly 600 glass beads from a necklace, pieces of amber, and fine gold threads that were originally part of a brocade-like fabric. The floor had been covered with cowskins. A central mound, high and in diameter covered this chamber.

====Grave VI====
 southeast of the central chamber and about above the old ground surface lay an unplundered wooden chamber (grave VI). It measured and was high. This grave also contained a man and a woman. Their equipment included a four-wheeled chariot with trappings for two horses, bronze eating and drinking vessels, a quiver with 51 iron arrowheads, an iron knife and many amber and glass beads (from necklaces), including 2,300 green glass beads. The woman had been laid in the chariot, the man on the floor. The bronze vessels were placed by their feet and heads. There were also remains of embroidered fabrics.

====Grave IX====
Grave IX, a so-called pyre grave, was located above VI. Its occupant was a woman who had died between 18 and 30 years of age, her remains accompanied by two bronze armlets and over 20 pottery vessels with incised and stamped decorations and red paint.

====Other graves====
Six further graves (II-V, VII, VIII) were inhumations. 22 fireplaces found within the mound are probably connected to cult activity. Some or all of them may represent funerary pyres.

==Interpretation and significance==
There can be no doubt that the Heuneburg and its associated monuments are one of the most important centres of the early Celtic Iron Age in Central Europe. It is also clear that the site should be seen in a context with other prominent centres of its time, the so-called &quot;Fürstensitze&quot; (German: &quot;princely seats&quot; - see below).

===Social/economic development===
The Heuneburg settlement reflects important sociopolitical developments in early Celtic Europe. It appears to be the case that after 700 BC, in some regions, wealth and population became concentrated in relatively small areas, a development that further accelerated after 600 BC. 
A growing differentiation in terms of wealth that is visible among settlements sites but especially among burials, indicates the development of social hierarchies. This is illustrated by the discovery, in 2005, of the burial of a 2-year-old child near the Heuneburg, accompanied by imported (Etruscan) jewellery. It is clear that a young child could not have earned or gained such wealth, hence the individual must have been born rich. There is probably also an element of political centralisation involved in these processes. The fact that the Heuneburg and &quot;Aussensiedlung&quot; were not able to locally produce enough food to support their own populations implied quite clearly that they must have been able to receive and maintain the support of a much larger surrounding area.
The ongoing social and professional specialisation had led to the development of specialised workshops, perhaps even artisanal quarters that did not just produce to serve local needs.

====The term &quot;Fürstensitz&quot;====
The traditional term &quot;Fürstensitz&quot; (&quot;princely seat&quot;) to describe sites like Heuneburg has been criticised recently, especially by the archaeologist Manfred Eggert (University of Tübingen). It could be argued that the phrase implies a potentially misleading interpretation of power structures, potentially distracting from more complex realities.

===Interaction with other sites===
Several other hilltop sites came into existence in the broader region at the same time as the Heuneburg, about 700 BC. Initially, they may have been similar in size and population. Strikingly, most of them were abandoned around 600 BC, i.e. when the Heuneburg settlement was reorganised. It is possible that the Heuneburg had become so powerful as to attract population at the expense of other sites.
It has long been suggested that the Hohenasperg settlement, some to the North of the Heuneburg, was somehow involved in the destruction of the Heuneburg after 500 BC and profited from its demise (see &quot;abandonment&quot; below). There is no clear evidence for such an interpretation, especially as the abandonment of the Heuneburg area is now in doubt (see below).

===Destructions, abandonment, and continuity===
The traditional view that the two main destructions of the citadel fortifications are the result of violent destruction, and that the Heuneburg was abandoned after the second destruction, which may have been part of a power struggle with Honenasperg, have lost some ground recently.
It remains likely that the mudbrick fortification was indeed destroyed violently, but there is no exact evidence to indicate whether this may have been the result of external warfare or of internal difficulties. The renewed economic flourish after this event may argue against a wholesale destruction of the site. 
The second destruction, in the 5th century, is even more problematic. It has been argued that the fire or fires could be accidental. It is also important to note that although the Heuneburg plateau is mostly abandoned at this time, as is the &quot;Aussensiedlung&quot;, smaller settlements develop in the surrounding area and burial activity continues, perhaps suggesting a change in the focus of settlement activity, possibly connected with sociopolitical changes at that time.

===Climate===
It has been proposed that the flourishing of Celtic cultures between the 7th and 5th centuries BC is connected with a warm phase that coincided with that period. A milder climate would have permitted more successful agriculture, which would, in turn, have allowed for larger populations, and thus for the development of more complex political, social and artisanal specialisations. The end of this mild period would have led to population losses and to a collapse of the established economic systems. The demise of centres like the Heuneburg, but also the 4th century Celtic migrations could be connected with such events.

===Trade, contacts with the Classical World===
The importance of the Heuneburg, like that of other contemporary centres, is closely connected with its location in relation to several important trade routes. Placed just north of the Alps and on the Danube, the site had access to important land routes across the mountains from Italy and Southern France (especially the Greek colony of Massalia), and, by river, to the Balkans and the Black Sea. It was involved in long-distance trade between northern and southern Europe, involving luxury goods (as found in the burial mounds) and probably wine from the south, and amber, metals, as well as probably perishables like leather and fur, from the north.
The Mediterranean (Greek and/or Etruscan) influence on the Heuneburg is especially strongly reflected by its mudbrick fortification and the newly found ashlar masonry.

===Pyrene===
In the mid-5th century BC, the Greek historian Herodotus (Book 2.33) made a brief passing reference to a Celtic city called by the Greek &quot;Pyrene&quot;: &quot;For the Ister flows from the land of the Celts and the city of Pyrene through the very middle of Europe...&quot; Since the Heuneburg is roughly in the right location and was a major regional centre just before that time, it is possible that it is the settlement referred to by that name.

==Museums==
The Heuneburgmuseum is located in the renovated barn of the former monastery of Heiligkreuztal at Hundersingen. The exhibition explains the importance of the site and displays some of the original finds from the site and nearby burials.

In recent years, an open-air museum has been erected on the Heuneburg plateau itself. It includes reconstructions of several houses and of part of the mudbrick wall.

Some of the finds from the Hohmichele grave are partially on display in the Württemberg State Museum (Stuttgart).

<text>The term Vital Center was coined by the Harvard historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in his 1949 book of that title. 

Schlesinger first mentioned the term in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article in April 1948 titled “Not Left, Not Right, But a Vital Center.”

US President Bill Clinton started to use the phrase &quot;vital center&quot; in speeches given during his term of office. In 1997, Schlesinger noted in an article for &quot;Slate&quot; magazine that Clinton hoped to appropriate the term to mean &quot;middle of the road&quot; or something that his &quot;DLC fans&quot; might prefer its meaning to be, which would locate it &quot;somewhere closer to Ronald Reagan than to Franklin D. Roosevelt.&quot; In the &quot;Slate&quot; article, Schlesinger strongly rejected that interpretation of the term:

He would later reiterate this argument in his 1998 introduction, objecting to the domestic use of the phrase:

<doc id="652531" wikidata="Q192127" url="?curid=652531" title="Photovoltaics">
<text>Photovoltaics (PV) is the conversion of light into electricity using semiconducting materials that exhibit the photovoltaic effect, a phenomenon studied in physics, photochemistry, and electrochemistry. The photovoltaic effect is commercially used for electricity generation and as photosensors.

A photovoltaic system employs solar modules, each comprising a number of solar cells, which generate electrical power. PV installations may be ground-mounted, rooftop-mounted, wall-mounted or floating. The mount may be fixed or use a solar tracker to follow the sun across the sky.

Photovoltaic technology helps to mitigate climate change because it emits much less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels. Solar PV has specific advantages as an energy source: once installed, its operation does not generate any pollution or any greenhouse gas emissions; it shows scalability in respect of power needs and silicon has large availability in the Earth&#x27;s crust, although other materials required in PV system manufacture such as silver may constrain further growth in the technology. Other major constraints identified include competition for land use. The use of PV as a main source requires energy storage systems or global distribution by high-voltage direct current power lines causing additional costs, and also has a number of other specific disadvantages such as variable power generation which have to be balanced. Production and installation does cause some pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, though only a fraction of the emissions caused by fossil fuels.

Photovoltaic systems have long been used in specialized applications as stand-alone installations and grid-connected PV systems have been in use since the 1990s. Photovoltaic modules were first mass-produced in 2000, when the German government funded a one hundred thousand roof program. Decreasing costs has allowed PV to grow as an energy source. This has been partially driven by massive Chinese government investment in developing solar production capacity since 2000, and achieving economies of scale. Improvements in manufacturing technology and efficiency have also led to decreasing costs. Net metering and financial incentives, such as preferential feed-in tariffs for solar-generated electricity, have supported solar PV installations in many countries. Panel prices dropped by a factor of 4 between 2004 and 2011. Module prices dropped by about 90% over the 2010s.

In 2022, worldwide installed PV capacity increased to more than 1 terawatt (TW) covering nearly two percent of global electricity demand. After hydro and wind powers, PV is the third renewable energy source in terms of global capacity. In 2022, the International Energy Agency expected a growth by over 1 TW from 2022 to 2027. In some instances, PV has offered the cheapest source of electrical power in regions with a high solar potential, with a bid for pricing as low as 0.015 US$/kWh in Qatar in 2023. In 2023, the International Energy Agency stated in its World Energy Outlook that &#x27;[f]or projects with low cost financing that tap high quality resources, solar PV is now the cheapest source of electricity in history.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;photovoltaic&quot; comes from the Greek () meaning &quot;light&quot;, and from &quot;volt&quot;, the unit of electromotive force, the volt, which in turn comes from the last name of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta, inventor of the battery (electrochemical cell). The term &quot;photovoltaic&quot; has been in use in English since 1849.

== History ==
In 1989, the German Research Ministry initiated the first ever program to finance PV roofs (2200 roofs). A program led by Walter Sandtner in Bonn, Germany.

In 1994, Japan followed in their footsteps and conducted a similar program with 539 residential PV systems installed. Since, many countries have continued to produce and finance PV systems in an exponential speed.

== Solar cells ==

Photovoltaics are best known as a method for generating electric power by using solar cells to convert energy from the sun into a flow of electrons by the photovoltaic effect.

Solar cells produce direct current electricity from sunlight which can be used to power equipment or to recharge batteries. The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft, but today the majority of photovoltaic modules are used for grid-connected systems for power generation. In this case an inverter is required to convert the DC to AC. There is also a smaller market for stand alone systems for remote dwellings, boats, recreational vehicles, electric cars, roadside emergency telephones, remote sensing, and cathodic protection of pipelines.

Photovoltaic power generation employs solar modules composed of a number of solar cells containing a semiconductor material. Copper solar cables connect modules (module cable), arrays (array cable), and sub-fields. Because of the growing demand for renewable energy sources, the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years.

Cells require protection from the environment and are usually packaged tightly in solar modules.

Photovoltaic module power is measured under standard test conditions (STC) in &quot;Wp&quot; (watts peak). The actual power output at a particular place may be less than or greater than this rated value, depending on geographical location, time of day, weather conditions, and other factors. Solar photovoltaic array capacity factors are typically under 25% when not coupled with storage, which is lower than many other industrial sources of electricity.

===Solar cell efficiencies===
== Performance and degradation ==
Module performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): irradiance of 1,000 W/m2, solar spectrum of AM 1.5 and module temperature at 25 °C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on geographic location, time of day, the day of the year, amount of solar irradiance, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, soiling, state of charge, and temperature. Performance of a module or panel can be measured at different time intervals with a DC clamp meter or shunt and logged, graphed, or charted with a chart recorder or data logger.

For optimum performance, a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular to direct sunlight. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels and optimize output. These bypass diodes are usually placed along groups of solar cells to create a continuous flow.

Electrical characteristics include nominal power (PMAX, measured in W), open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (ISC, measured in amperes), maximum power voltage (VMPP), maximum power current (IMPP), peak power (watt-peak, Wp), and module efficiency (%).

Open-circuit voltage or VOC is the maximum voltage the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. VOC can be measured with a voltmeter directly on an illuminated module&#x27;s terminals or on its disconnected cable.

The peak power rating, Wp, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately , will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 600 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.

=== Influence of temperature ===

The performance of a photovoltaic (PV) module depends on the environmental conditions, mainly on the global incident irradiance G in the plane of the module. However, the temperature T of the p–n junction also influences the main electrical parameters: the short circuit current ISC, the open circuit voltage VOC and the maximum power Pmax. In general, it is known that VOC shows a significant inverse correlation with T, while for ISC this correlation is direct, but weaker, so that this increase does not compensate for the decrease in VOC. As a consequence, Pmax decreases when T increases. This correlation between the power output of a solar cell and the working temperature of its junction depends on the semiconductor material, and is due to the influence of T on the concentration, lifetime, and mobility of the intrinsic carriers, i.e., electrons and gaps. inside the photovoltaic cell.

Temperature sensitivity is usually described by temperature coefficients, each of which expresses the derivative of the parameter to which it refers with respect to the junction temperature. The values of these parameters, which can be found in any data sheet of the photovoltaic module, are the following:

* β: VOC variation coefficient with respect to T, given by ∂VOC/∂T.
* α: Coefficient of variation of ISC with respect to T, given by ∂ISC/∂T.
* δ: Coefficient of variation of Pmax with respect to T, given by ∂Pmax/∂T.

Techniques for estimating these coefficients from experimental data can be found in the literature.

===Degradation===

The ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, hail, heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.

Potential-induced degradation (also called PID) is a potential-induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.

The largest challenge for photovoltaic technology is the purchase price per watt of electricity produced. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of &quot;doping&quot; the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.

Chemicals such as boron (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor bands. In doing so, the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease twenty-fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (EB) is so low, the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.

The power output of a photovoltaic (PV) device decreases over time. This decrease is due to its exposure to solar radiation as well as other external conditions. The degradation index, which is defined as the annual percentage of output power loss, is a key factor in determining the long-term production of a photovoltaic plant. To estimate this degradation, the percentage of decrease associated with each of the electrical parameters. The individual degradation of a photovoltaic module can significantly influence the performance of a complete string. Furthermore, not all modules in the same installation decrease their performance at exactly the same rate. Given a set of modules exposed to long-term outdoor conditions, the individual degradation of the main electrical parameters and the increase in their dispersion must be considered. As each module tends to degrade differently, the behavior of the modules will be increasingly different over time, negatively affecting the overall performance of the plant.

There are several studies dealing with the power degradation analysis of modules based on different photovoltaic technologies available in the literature. According to a recent study, the degradation of crystalline silicon modules is very regular, oscillating between 0.8% and 1.0% per year.

On the other hand, if we analyze the performance of thin-film photovoltaic modules, an initial period of strong degradation is observed (which can last several months and up to two years), followed by a later stage in which the degradation stabilizes, being then comparable to that of crystalline silicon. Strong seasonal variations are also observed in such thin-film technologies because the influence of the solar spectrum is much greater. For example, for modules of amorphous silicon, micromorphic silicon or cadmium telluride, we are talking about annual degradation rates for the first years of between 3% and 4%. However, other technologies, such as CIGS, show much lower degradation rates, even in those early years.

== Manufacturing of PV systems==

Overall the manufacturing process of creating solar photovoltaics is simple in that it does not require the culmination of many complex or moving parts. Because of the solid-state nature of PV systems, they often have relatively long lifetimes, anywhere from 10 to 30 years. To increase the electrical output of a PV system, the manufacturer must simply add more photovoltaic components. Because of this, economies of scale are important for manufacturers as costs decrease with increasing output.

While there are many types of PV systems known to be effective, crystalline silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an n-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses, an anti-reflective coating is added to the surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.

===Environmental costs of manufacture===
Solar photovoltaic power is not entirely &quot;clean energy&quot;: production produces greenhouse gas emissions, materials used to build the cells are potentially unsustainable and will run out eventually, the technology uses toxic substances which cause pollution, and there are no viable technologies for recycling solar waste. Data required to investigate their impact are sometimes affected by a rather large amount of uncertainty. The values of human labor and water consumption, for example, are not precisely assessed due to the lack of systematic and accurate analyses in the scientific literature. One difficulty in determining effects due to PV is to determine if the wastes are released to the air, water, or soil during the manufacturing phase. Life-cycle assessments, which look at all different environment effects ranging from global warming potential, pollution, water depletion and others, are unavailable for PV. Instead, studies have tried to estimate the impact and potential impact of various types of PV, but these estimates are usually restricted to simply assessing energy costs of the manufacture and/or transport, because these are new technologies and the total environmental impact of their components and disposal methods are unknown, even for commercially available first generation solar cells, let alone experimental prototypes with no commercial viability.

Thus, estimates of the environmental impact of PV have focused on carbon dioxide equivalents per kWh or energy pay-back time (EPBT). The EPBT describes the timespan a PV system needs to operate in order to generate the same amount of energy that was used for its manufacture. Another study includes transport energy costs in the EPBT. The EPBT has also been defined completely differently as &quot;the time needed to compensate for the total renewable- and non-renewable primary energy required during the life cycle of a PV system&quot; in another study, which also included installation costs. This energy amortization, given in years, is also referred to as &quot;break-even&quot; energy payback time. The lower the EPBT, the lower the environmental cost of solar power. The EPBT depends vastly on the location where the PV system is installed (e.g. the amount of sunlight available and the efficiency of the electrical grid) and on the type of system, namely the system&#x27;s components.

A 2015 review of EPBT estimates of first and second-generation PV suggested that there was greater variation in embedded energy than in efficiency of the cells implying that it was mainly the embedded energy that needs to reduce to have a greater reduction in EPBT.

In general, the most important component of solar panels, which accounts for much of the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, is the refining of the polysilicon. As to how much percentage of the EPBT this silicon depends on the type of system. A fully autarkic system requires additional components (&#x27;Balance of System&#x27;, the power inverters, storage, etc.) which significantly increase the energy cost of manufacture, but in a simple rooftop system, some 90% of the energy cost is from silicon, with the remainder coming from the inverters and module frame.

The EPBT relates closely to the concepts of net energy gain (NEG) and energy returned on energy invested (EROI). They are both used in energy economics and refer to the difference between the energy expended to harvest an energy source and the amount of energy gained from that harvest. The NEG and EROI also take the operating lifetime of a PV system into account and a working life of 25 to 30 years is typically assumed. From these metrics, the Energy payback Time can be derived by calculation.

====EPBT improvements====

PV systems using crystalline silicon, by far the majority of the systems in practical use, have such a high EPBT because silicon is produced by the reduction of high-grade quartz sand in electric furnaces. This coke-fired smelting process occurs at high temperatures of more than 1000 °C and is very energy intensive, using about 11 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per produced kilogram of silicon. The energy requirements of this process makes the energy cost per unit of silicon produced relatively inelastic, which means that the production process itself will not become more efficient in the future.

Nonetheless, the energy payback time has shortened significantly over the last years, as crystalline silicon cells became ever more efficient in converting sunlight, while the thickness of the wafer material was constantly reduced and therefore required less silicon for its manufacture. Within the last ten years, the amount of silicon used for solar cells declined from 16 to 6 grams per watt-peak. In the same period, the thickness of a c-Si wafer was reduced from 300 μm, or microns, to about 160–190 μm. The sawing techniques that slice crystalline silicon ingots into wafers have also improved by reducing the kerf loss and making it easier to recycle the silicon sawdust.

==== Effects from first generation PV ====

Crystalline silicon modules are the most extensively studied PV type in terms of LCA since they are the most commonly used. Mono-crystalline silicon photovoltaic systems (mono-si) have an average efficiency of 14.0%. The cells tend to follow a structure of front electrode, anti-reflection film, n-layer, p-layer, and back electrode, with the sun hitting the front electrode. EPBT ranges from 1.7 to 2.7 years. The cradle to gate of CO2-eq/kWh ranges from 37.3 to 72.2 grams when installed in Southern Europe.

Techniques to produce multi-crystalline silicon (multi-si) photovoltaic cells are simpler and cheaper than mono-si, however tend to make less efficient cells, an average of 13.2%. EPBT ranges from 1.5 to 2.6 years. The cradle to gate of CO2-eq/kWh ranges from 28.5 to 69 grams when installed in Southern Europe.

Assuming that the following countries had a high-quality grid infrastructure as in Europe, in 2020 it was calculated it would take 1.28 years in Ottawa, Canada, for a rooftop photovoltaic system to produce the same amount of energy as required to manufacture the silicon in the modules in it (excluding the silver, glass, mounts and other components), 0.97 years in Catania, Italy, and 0.4 years in Jaipur, India. Outside of Europe, where net grid efficiencies are lower, it would take longer. This &#x27;energy payback time&#x27; can be seen as the portion of time during the useful lifetime of the module in which the energy production is polluting. At best, this means that a 30-year old panel has produced clean energy for 97% of its lifetime, or that the silicon in the modules in a solar panel produce 97% less greenhouse gas emissions than a coal-fired plant for the same amount of energy (assuming and ignoring many things). Some studies have looked beyond EPBT and GWP to other environmental effects. In one such study, conventional energy mix in Greece was compared to multi-si PV and found a 95% overall reduction in effects including carcinogens, eco-toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, and eleven others.

==== Impact from second generation PV ====

Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is one of the fastest-growing thin film based solar cells which are collectively known as second-generation devices. This new thin-film device also shares similar performance restrictions (Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit) as conventional Si devices but promises to lower the cost of each device by both reducing material and energy consumption during manufacturing. The global market share of CdTe was 4.7% in 2008. This technology&#x27;s highest power conversion efficiency is 21%. The cell structure includes glass substrate (around 2 mm), transparent conductor layer, CdS buffer layer (50–150 nm), CdTe absorber and a metal contact layer.

CdTe PV systems require less energy input in their production than other commercial PV systems per unit electricity production. The average CO2-eq/kWh is around 18 grams (cradle to gate). CdTe has the fastest EPBT of all commercial PV technologies, which varies between 0.3 and 1.2 years.

==== Effects from third generation PV ====

Third-generation PVs are designed to combine the advantages of both the first and second generation devices and they do not have Shockley-Queisser limit, a theoretical limit for first and second generation PV cells. The thickness of a third generation device is less than 1 μm.

Two new promising thin film technologies are copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4 or CZTS), zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) and single-walled carbon nano-tubes (SWCNT). These thin films are currently only produced in the lab but may be commercialized in the future. The manufacturing of CZTS and (Zn3P2) processes are expected to be similar to those of current thin film technologies of CIGS and CdTe, respectively. While the absorber layer of SWCNT PV is expected to be synthesized with CoMoCAT method. by Contrary to established thin films such as CIGS and CdTe, CZTS, Zn3P2, and SWCNT PVs are made from earth abundant, nontoxic materials and have the potential to produce more electricity annually than the current worldwide consumption. While CZTS and Zn3P2 offer good promise for these reasons, the specific environmental implications of their commercial production are not yet known. Global warming potential of CZTS and Zn3P2 were found 38 and 30 grams CO2-eq/kWh while their corresponding EPBT were found 1.85 and 0.78 years, respectively. Overall, CdTe and Zn3P2 have similar environmental effects but can slightly outperform CIGS and CZTS. A study on environmental impacts of SWCNT PVs by Celik et al., including an existing 1% efficient device and a theoretical 28% efficient device, found that, compared to monocrystalline Si, the environmental impacts from 1% SWCNT was ~18 times higher due mainly to the short lifetime of three years.

== Economics ==


There have been major changes in the underlying costs, industry structure and market prices of solar photovoltaics technology, over the years, and gaining a coherent picture of the shifts occurring across the industry value chain globally is a challenge. This is due to: &quot;the rapidity of cost and price changes, the complexity of the PV supply chain, which involves a large number of manufacturing processes, the balance of system (BOS) and installation costs associated with complete PV systems, the choice of different distribution channels, and differences between regional markets within which PV is being deployed&quot;. Further complexities result from the many different policy support initiatives that have been put in place to facilitate photovoltaics commercialisation in various countries.

Renewable energy technologies have generally gotten cheaper since their invention. Renewable energy systems have become cheaper to build than fossil fuel power plants across much of the world, thanks to advances in wind and solar energy technology, in particular.

* Implications for electricity bill management and energy investment

There is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charges when electricity prices are reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example in residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economic decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematic evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.

===Hardware costs===

In 1977 crystalline silicon solar cell prices were at $76.67/W.

Although wholesale module prices remained flat at around $3.50 to $4.00/W in the early 2000s due to high demand in Germany and Spain afforded by generous subsidies and shortage of polysilicon, demand crashed with the abrupt ending of Spanish subsidies after the market crash of 2008, and the price dropped rapidly to $2.00/W. Manufacturers were able to maintain a positive operating margin despite a 50% drop in income due to innovation and reductions in costs. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules suddenly dropped below the $1.00/W mark, taking many in the industry by surprise, and has caused a number of solar manufacturing companies to go bankrupt throughout the world. The $1.00/W cost is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of grid parity for PV, but most experts do not believe this price point is sustainable. Technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, may mean that further price reductions are possible. The average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the Solarbuzz group fell from $3.50/watt to $2.43/watt over the course of 2011. In 2013 wholesale prices had fallen to $0.74/W. This has been cited as evidence supporting &#x27;Swanson&#x27;s law&#x27;, an observation similar to the famous Moore&#x27;s Law, which claims that solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of industry capacity. The Fraunhofer Institute defines the &#x27;learning rate&#x27; as the drop in prices as the cumulative production doubles, some 25% between 1980 and 2010. Although the prices for modules have dropped quickly, current inverter prices have dropped at a much lower rate, and in 2019 constitute over 61% of the cost per kWp, from a quarter in the early 2000s.

Note that the prices mentioned above are for bare modules, another way of looking at module prices is to include installation costs. In the US, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the price of installed rooftop PV modules for homeowners fell from $9.00/W in 2006 to $5.46/W in 2011. Including the prices paid by industrial installations, the national installed price drops to $3.45/W. This is markedly higher than elsewhere in the world, in Germany homeowner rooftop installations averaged at $2.24/W. The cost differences are thought to be primarily based on the higher regulatory burden and lack of a national solar policy in the US.

By the end of 2012 Chinese manufacturers had production costs of $0.50/W in the cheapest modules. In some markets distributors of these modules can earn a considerable margin, buying at factory-gate price and selling at the highest price the market can support (&#x27;value-based pricing&#x27;). In California PV reached grid parity in 2011, which is usually defined as PV production costs at or below retail electricity prices (though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs). Grid parity had been reached in 19 markets in 2014.

By 2024, massive increases of production of solar panels in China had caused module prices to drop to as low as $0.11/W, an over 90 percent reduction from 2011 prices.

===Levelised cost of electricity===

The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is the cost per kWh based on the costs distributed over the project lifetime, and is thought to be a better metric for calculating viability than price per wattage. LCOEs vary dramatically depending on the location. The LCOE can be considered the minimum price customers will have to pay the utility company in order for it to break even on the investment in a new power station. Grid parity is roughly achieved when the LCOE falls to a similar price as conventional local grid prices, although in actuality the calculations are not directly comparable. Large industrial PV installations had reached grid parity in California in 2011. Grid parity for rooftop systems was still believed to be much farther away at this time. Many LCOE calculations are not thought to be accurate, and a large amount of assumptions are required. Module prices may drop further, and the LCOE for solar may correspondingly drop in the future.

Because energy demands rise and fall over the course of the day, and solar power is limited by the fact that the sun sets, solar power companies must also factor in the additional costs of supplying a more stable alternative energy supplies to the grid in order to stabilize the system, or storing the energy. These costs are not factored into LCOE calculations, nor are special subsidies or premiums that may make buying solar power more attractive. The unreliability and temporal variation in generation of solar and wind power is a major problem. Too much of these volatile power sources can cause instability of the entire grid.

As of 2017 power-purchase agreement prices for solar farms below $0.05/kWh are common in the United States, and the lowest bids in some Persian Gulf countries were about $0.03/kWh. The goal of the United States Department of Energy is to achieve a levelised cost of energy for solar PV of $0.03/kWh for utility companies.

===Subsidies and financing===
Financial incentives for photovoltaics, such as feed-in tariffs (FITs), were often offered to electricity consumers to install and operate solar-electric generating systems, and in some countries such subsidies are the only way photovoltaics can remain economically profitable. PV FITs were crucial for early growth of photovoltaics. Germany and Spain were the most important countries offering subsidies for PV, and the policies of these countries drove demand. 

Some US solar cell manufacturing companies have repeatedly complained that the dropping prices of PV module costs have been achieved due to subsidies by the government of China, and the dumping of these products below fair market prices. US manufacturers generally recommend high tariffs on foreign supplies to allow them remain profitable. In response to these concerns, the Obama administration began to levy tariffs on US consumers of these products in 2012 to raise prices for domestic manufacturers. The USA, however, also subsidies the industry.

Some environmentalists have promoted the idea that government incentives should be used in order to expand the PV manufacturing industry to reduce costs of PV-generated electricity much more rapidly to a level where it is able to compete with fossil fuels in a free market. This is based on the theory that when the manufacturing capacity doubles, economies of scale will cause the prices of the solar products to halve.

In many countries access to capital is lacking to develop PV projects. To solve this problem, securitization is sometimes used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects.

===Other===
Photovoltaic power is also generated during a time of day that is close to peak demand (precedes it) in electricity systems with high use of air conditioning. Since large-scale PV operation requires back-up in the form of spinning reserves, its marginal cost of generation in the middle of the day is typically lowest, but not zero, when PV is generating electricity. This can be seen in Figure 1 of this paper:. For residential properties with private PV facilities networked to the grid, the owner may be able earn extra money when the time of generation is included, as electricity is worth more during the day than at night.

One journalist theorised in 2012 that if the energy bills of Americans were forced upwards by imposing an extra tax of $50/ton on carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power, this could have allowed solar PV to appear more cost-competitive to consumers in most locations.

== Growth ==

Solar photovoltaics formed the largest body of research among the seven sustainable energy types examined in a global bibliometric study, with the annual scientific output growing from 9,094 publications in 2011 to 14,447 publications in 2019.

Likewise, the application of solar photovoltaics is growing rapidly and the worldwide installed capacity reached one terawatt in April 2022. The total power output of the world&#x27;s PV capacity in a calendar year is now beyond 500 TWh of electricity. This represents 2% of worldwide electricity demand. More than 100 countries, such as Brazil and India, use solar PV. China is followed by the United States and Japan, while installations in Germany, once the world&#x27;s largest producer, have been slowing down.

Honduras generated the highest percentage of its energy from solar in 2019, 14.8%. As of 2019, Vietnam has the highest installed capacity in Southeast Asia, about 4.5 GW. The annualized installation rate of about 90 W per capita per annum places Vietnam among world leaders. Generous Feed-in tariff (FIT) and government supporting policies such as tax exemptions were the key to enable Vietnam&#x27;s solar PV boom. Underlying drivers include the government&#x27;s desire to enhance energy self-sufficiency and the public&#x27;s demand for local environmental quality.

A key barrier is limited transmission grid capacity.

China has the world&#x27;s largest solar power capacity, with 390 GW of installed capacity in 2022 compared with about 200 GW in the European Union, according to International Energy Agency data. Other countries with the world&#x27;s largest solar power capacities include the United States, Japan and Germany.

In 2017, it was thought probable that by 2030 global PV installed capacities could be between 3,000 and 10,000 GW. Greenpeace in 2010 claimed that 1,845 GW of PV systems worldwide could be generating approximately 2,646 TWh/year of electricity by 2030, and by 2050 over 20% of all electricity could be provided by PV.

== Applications ==
There are many practical applications for the use of solar panels or photovoltaics covering every technological domain under the sun. From the fields of the agricultural industry as a power source for irrigation to its usage in remote health care facilities to refrigerate medical supplies. Other applications include power generation at various scales and attempts to integrate them into homes and public infrastructure. PV modules are used in photovoltaic systems and include a large variety of electrical devices.

=== Photovoltaic systems ===
A photovoltaic system, or solar PV system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as mounting, cabling and other electrical accessories. PV systems range from small, roof-top mounted or building-integrated systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts, to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts. Nowadays, most PV systems are grid-connected, while stand-alone systems only account for a small portion of the market.

===Photo sensors===

Photosensors are sensors of light or other electromagnetic radiation. A photo detector has a p–n junction that converts light photons into current. The absorbed photons make electron–hole pairs in the depletion region. Photodiodes and photo transistors are a few examples of photo detectors. Solar cells convert some of the light energy absorbed into electrical energy.

== Experimental technology ==

Crystalline silicon photovoltaics are only one type of PV, and while they represent the majority of solar cells produced currently there are many new and promising technologies that have the potential to be scaled up to meet future energy needs. As of 2018, crystalline silicon cell technology serves as the basis for several PV module types, including monocrystalline, multicrystalline, mono PERC, and bifacial.

Another newer technology, thin-film PV, are manufactured by depositing semiconducting layers of perovskite, a mineral with semiconductor properties, on a substrate in vacuum. The substrate is often glass or stainless-steel, and these semiconducting layers are made of many types of materials including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). After being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser scribing. Perovskite solar cells are a very efficient solar energy converter and have excellent optoelectronic properties for photovoltaic purposes, but their upscaling from lab-sized cells to large-area modules is still under research. Thin-film photovoltaic materials may possibly become attractive in the future, because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers. In 2019 university labs at Oxford, Stanford and elsewhere reported perovskite solar cells with efficiencies of 20-25%.

=== CIGS ===

Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) is a thin film solar cell based on the copper indium diselenide (CIS) family of chalcopyrite semiconductors. CIS and CIGS are often used interchangeably within the CIS/CIGS community. The cell structure includes soda lime glass as the substrate, Mo layer as the back contact, CIS/CIGS as the absorber layer, cadmium sulfide (CdS) or Zn (S,OH)x as the buffer layer, and ZnO:Al as the front contact. CIGS is approximately 1/100 the thickness of conventional silicon solar cell technologies. Materials necessary for assembly are readily available, and are less costly per watt of solar cell. CIGS based solar devices resist performance degradation over time and are highly stable in the field.

Reported global warming potential impacts of CIGS ranges 20.5–58.8 grams CO2-eq/kWh of electricity generated for different solar irradiation (1,700 to 2,200 kWh/m2/y) and power conversion efficiency (7.8 – 9.12%). EPBT ranges from 0.2 to 1.4 years, while harmonized value of EPBT was found 1.393 years. Toxicity is an issue within the buffer layer of CIGS modules because it contains cadmium and gallium. CIS modules do not contain any heavy metals.

=== Perovskite solar cells ===
=== Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells ===

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are a novel thin film solar cell. These solar cells operate under ambient light better than other photovoltaic technologies. They work with light being absorbed in a sensitizing dye between two charge transport materials. Dye surrounds TiO2 nanoparticles which are in a sintered network. TiO2 acts as conduction band in an n-type semiconductor; the scaffold for adorned dye molecules and transports elections during excitation. For TiO2 DSC technology, sample preparation at high temperatures is very effective because higher temperatures produce more suitable textural properties. Another example of DSCs is the copper complex with Cu (II/I) as a redox shuttle with TMBY (4,4&#x27;,6,6&#x27;-tetramethyl-2,2&#x27;bipyridine). DSCs show great performance with artificial and indoor light. From a range of 200 lux to 2,000 lux, these cells operate at conditions of a maximum efficiency of 29.7%.

However, there have been issues with DSCs, many of which come from the liquid electrolyte. The solvent is hazardous, and will permeate most plastics. Because it is liquid, it is unstable to temperature variation, leading to freezing in cold temperatures and expansion in warm temperatures causing failure. Another disadvantage is that the solar cell is not ideal for large scale application because of its low efficiency. Some of the benefits for DSC is that it can be used in a variety of light levels (including cloudy conditions), it has a low production cost, and it does not degrade under sunlight, giving it a longer lifetime then other types of thin film solar cells.

=== OPV ===

Other possible future PV technologies include organic, dye-sensitized and quantum-dot photovoltaics. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) fall into the thin-film category of manufacturing, and typically operate around the 12% efficiency range which is lower than the 12–21% typically seen by silicon-based PVs. Because organic photovoltaics require very high purity and are relatively reactive they must be encapsulated which vastly increases the cost of manufacturing and means that they are not feasible for large scale-up. Dye-sensitized PVs are similar in efficiency to OPVs but are significantly easier to manufacture. However, these dye-sensitized photovoltaics present storage problems because the liquid electrolyte is toxic and can potentially permeate the plastics used in the cell. Quantum dot solar cells are solution-processed, meaning they are potentially scalable, but currently they peak at 12% efficiency.

Organic and polymer photovoltaic (OPV) are a relatively new area of research. The tradition OPV cell structure layers consist of a semi-transparent electrode, electron blocking layer, tunnel junction, holes blocking layer, electrode, with the sun hitting the transparent electrode. OPV replaces silver with carbon as an electrode material lowering manufacturing cost and making them more environmentally friendly. OPV are flexible, low weight, and work well with roll-to roll manufacturing for mass production. OPV uses &quot;only abundant elements coupled to an extremely low embodied energy through very low processing temperatures using only ambient processing conditions on simple printing equipment enabling energy pay-back times&quot;. Current efficiencies range 1–6.5%, however theoretical analyses show promise beyond 10% efficiency.

Many different configurations of OPV exist using different materials for each layer. OPV technology rivals existing PV technologies in terms of EPBT even if they currently present a shorter operational lifetime. A 2013 study analyzed 12 different configurations all with 2% efficiency, the EPBT ranged from 0.29 to 0.52 years for 1 m2 of PV. The average CO2-eq/kWh for OPV is 54.922 grams.

=== Thermophotovoltaics ===
=== Photovoltaic-Thermoelectric Generator ===
Photovoltaic-Thermoelectric Generator (PV-TEG) hybrid system is a type of hybrid PV cell that pairs a photovoltaic (PV) cell with a thermoelectric generator (TEG). TEGs rely on the Seebeck effect, a phenomenon that occurs when a junction of two conducting materials experience a temperature difference thereby, inducing an electromotive force. The resulting voltage is directly proportional to the temperature difference.

During the process of converting light into electricity, heat dissipates, making PV cells less efficient at high temperatures and reducing their lifespan. By integrating a TEG into the system, heat is facilitated away from the PV cell and converts it into electricity, thereby improving its efficiency and longevity. 

The thermoelectric figure of merit ZT, determines the efficiency of converting heat into electricity as well as the ability to cool. Optimizing parameters such as electrical conductivity (σ), Seebeck coefficient (S), thermal conductivity (κ) are of interest to maximize efficiencies.

formula_1

Common thermoelectric materials typically have a ZT value of about 1, corresponding to an efficiency of approximately 10% or less. While typical TEGs have a low conversion efficiency, ongoing research in thermoelectric materials such as BiTe (ZT = 2.4) , SnSe (ZT = 2.6), and half-Heusler compounds (ZT = 1.6) have led to improvement in efficiency over the years. Theoretical predictions indicate greater potential for optimization, with estimated values of 14 for BiTe, 2.6 for SnSe, and 2.2 for half-Heusler.

=== Solar module alignment ===

A number of solar modules may also be mounted vertically above each other in a tower, if the zenith distance of the Sun is greater than zero, and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each module additionally around a horizontal axis. In such a tower the modules can follow the Sun exactly. Such a device may be described as a ladder mounted on a turnable disk. Each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular solar panel. In case the zenith distance of the Sun reaches zero, the &quot;ladder&quot; may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar module producing a shadow on a lower one. Instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the polar star, meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the Earth. In this case the angle between the axis and the Sun is always larger than 66 degrees. During a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the Sun. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (building-integrated photovoltaics).

Where land may be limited, PV can be deployed as floating solar. In 2008 the Far Niente Winery pioneered the world&#x27;s first &quot;floatovoltaic&quot; system by installing 994 photovoltaic solar panels onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery&#x27;s irrigation pond. A benefit of the set up is that the panels are kept at a lower temperature than they would be on land, leading to a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion. The floating panels also reduce the amount of water lost through evaporation and inhibit the growth of algae.

Concentrator photovoltaics is a technology that contrary to conventional flat-plate PV systems uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. These systems sometimes use solar trackers and a cooling system to increase their efficiency.

=== Efficiency ===
In 2019, the world record for solar cell efficiency at 47.1% was achieved by using multi-junction concentrator solar cells, developed at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Colorado, US. The highest efficiencies achieved without concentration include a material by Sharp Corporation at 35.8% using a proprietary triple-junction manufacturing technology in 2009, and Boeing Spectrolab (40.7% also using a triple-layer design).

There is an ongoing effort to increase the conversion efficiency of PV cells and modules, primarily for competitive advantage. In order to increase the efficiency of solar cells, it is important to choose a semiconductor material with an appropriate band gap that matches the solar spectrum. This will enhance the electrical and optical properties. Improving the method of charge collection is also useful for increasing the efficiency. There are several groups of materials that are being developed. Ultrahigh-efficiency devices (η&gt;30%) are made by using GaAs and GaInP2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells. High-quality, single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency, low cost cells (η&gt;20%).

Recent developments in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have made significant advancements in power conversion efficiency from 3% to over 15% since their introduction in the 1980s. To date, the highest reported power conversion efficiency ranges 6.7–8.94% for small molecule, 8.4–10.6% for polymer OPVs, and 7–21% for perovskite OPVs. OPVs are expected to play a major role in the PV market. Recent improvements have increased the efficiency and lowered cost, while remaining environmentally-benign and renewable.

Several companies have begun embedding power optimizers into PV modules called smart modules. These modules perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for each module individually, measure performance data for monitoring, and provide additional safety features. Such modules can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to decrease.

One of the major causes for the decreased performance of cells is overheating. The efficiency of a solar cell declines by about 0.5% for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature. This means that a 100 degree increase in surface temperature could decrease the efficiency of a solar cell by about half. Self-cooling solar cells are one solution to this problem. Rather than using energy to cool the surface, pyramid and cone shapes can be formed from silica, and attached to the surface of a solar panel. Doing so allows visible light to reach the solar cells, but reflects infrared rays (which carry heat).

== Advantages ==

*;Pollution and energy in production

The 122 PW of sunlight reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface is plentiful—almost 10,000 times more than the 13 TW equivalent of average power consumed in 2005 by humans. This abundance leads to the suggestion that it will not be long before solar energy will become the world&#x27;s primary energy source. Additionally, solar radiation has the highest power density (global mean of 170 W/m2) among renewable energies.

Solar power is pollution-free during use, which enables it to cut down on pollution when it is substituted for other energy sources. For example, MIT estimated that 52,000 people per year die prematurely in the U.S. from coal-fired power plant pollution and all but one of these deaths could be prevented from using PV to replace coal. Production end-wastes and emissions are manageable using existing pollution controls. End-of-use recycling technologies are under development and policies are being produced that encourage recycling from producers.

Solar panels are usually guaranteed for 25 years (but inverters tend to fail sooner), with little maintenance or intervention after their initial set-up, so after the initial capital cost of building any solar power plant, operating costs are extremely low compared to existing power technologies.

Rooftop solar can be used locally, thus reducing transmission/distribution losses.

*;Solar cell research investment

Compared to fossil and nuclear energy sources, very little research money has been invested in the development of solar cells, so there is considerable room for improvement. Nevertheless, experimental high efficiency solar cells already have efficiencies of over 40% in case of concentrating photovoltaic cells and efficiencies are rapidly rising while mass-production costs are rapidly falling.

*;Housing subsidies

In some states of the United States, much of the investment in a home-mounted system may be lost if the homeowner moves and the buyer puts less value on the system than the seller. The city of Berkeley developed an innovative financing method to remove this limitation, by adding a tax assessment that is transferred with the home to pay for the solar panels. Now known as PACE, Property Assessed Clean Energy, 30 U.S. states have duplicated this solution.

== Disadvantages==

*Impact on electricity network

For behind-the-meter rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes two-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid, allowing for net metering. However, electricity networks traditionally are not designed to deal with two-way energy transfer, which may introduce technical issues. An over-voltage issue may come out as the electricity flows from these PV households back to the network. There are solutions to manage the over-voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at electricity distributor level, re-conductor the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.

High generation during the middle of the day reduces the net generation demand, but higher peak net demand as the sun goes down can require rapid ramping of utility generating stations, producing a load profile called the duck curve.

<doc id="652533" wikidata="Q187684" url="?curid=652533" title="Despotate of Epirus">
<text>The Despotate of Epirus () was one of the Greek successor states of the Byzantine Empire established in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade in 1204 by a branch of the Angelos dynasty. It claimed to be the legitimate successor of the Byzantine Empire during the subsequent struggle for Constantinople, along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Empire of Trebizond; its rulers briefly proclaiming themselves as Emperors in 1227–1242 (during which it is most often called the Empire of Thessalonica). The term &quot;Despotate of Epirus&quot; is, like &quot;Byzantine Empire&quot; itself, a modern historiographic convention and not a name in use at the time.

The Despotate was centred on the region of Epirus, encompassing also Albania and the western portion of Greek Macedonia and also included Thessaly and western Greece as far south as Nafpaktos. Through a policy of aggressive expansion under Theodore Komnenos Doukas the Despotate of Epirus also briefly came to incorporate central Macedonia, with the establishment of the Empire of Thessalonica in 1224, and Thrace as far east as Didymoteicho and Adrianople, and was on the verge of recapturing Constantinople and restoring the Byzantine Empire before the Battle of Klokotnitsa in 1230 where he was defeated by the Bulgarian Empire. After that, the Epirote state contracted to its core in Epirus and Thessaly, and was forced into vassalage to other regional powers. It nevertheless managed to retain its autonomy until being conquered by the restored Palaiologan Byzantine Empire in ca. 1337. In the 1410s, the Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos Carlo I Tocco managed to reunite the core of the Epirote state, but his successors gradually lost it to the advancing Ottoman Empire, with the last stronghold, Vonitsa, falling to the Ottomans in 1479.

==Nomenclature==

In traditional and modern historiography, the Epirote state is usually termed the &quot;Despotate of Epirus&quot; and its rulers are summarily attributed the title of &quot;Despot&quot; from its inception, but this use is not strictly accurate. First of all, the title of &quot;Despot&quot; was not borne by all Epirote rulers: the state&#x27;s founder, Michael I Komnenos Doukas, never used it, and is only anachronistically referred to as &quot;Despot of Epirus&quot; in 14th-century Western European sources. His successor Theodore Komnenos Doukas did not use it either, and actually crowned himself emperor (&quot;basileus&quot;) at Thessalonica . The first ruler of Epirus to receive the title of Despot was Michael II, from his uncle Manuel of Thessalonica in the 1230s, and then again, as a sign of submission and vassalage, from the Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes. Earlier historians assumed that Michael I was indeed named &quot;Despot&quot; by the deposed emperor Alexios III Angelos after ransoming him from Latin captivity in or ; this has been disproven by more recent research.

Furthermore, even after Michael II, speaking of the Epirote rulers as &quot;Despots &quot;of&quot; Epirus&quot; is technically incorrect. The title of Despot did not imply any specific territorial jurisdiction, nor was it hereditary; it was merely the highest rank in the Byzantine court hierarchy, awarded by a reigning emperor to close relatives, usually his sons. Consequently, it was often borne by the princes sent to govern semi-autonomous appanages and only later came to be associated with these territories as the practice became regularized (aside from Epirus, the Despotate of the Morea is the most notable case). The territorial term &quot;despotate&quot; itself (in Greek , ) was first used in contemporary sources for Epirus only from the 14th century on, e.g. in the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot;, in the history of John Kantakouzenos, the hagiography of St. Niphon, or the &quot;Chronicle of the Tocco&quot;, where the inhabitants of the Despotate are referred to as the &quot;Despotatoi&quot;. The term &quot;Despotate of Epirus&quot; is thus sometimes replaced by &quot;(Independent) State of Epirus&quot; in more recent historiography.

The Epirote realm itself did not have an official name. Contemporaries, particularly in Western Europe, used the term &quot;Romania&quot; (), which generally referred to the whole Byzantine Empire, to refer specifically to Epirus, as seen in the Latin title of &quot;Despotus Romanie&quot; claimed by Philip I of Taranto and his son Philip of Apulia, Nicholas Orsini, and later Carlo I Tocco. In the Byzantine world, the term &quot;Dysis&quot; (), meaning &quot;West&quot;, which historically referred to Dalmatia, Macedonia and Sicily, or even the entire European part of the Empire, also came into use already in the 13th century when juxtaposing Epirus to its eastern rival, the Empire of Nicaea, which was then called &quot;Anatolē&quot; (), &quot;East&quot;. Moreover, the term &quot;Hellenes&quot; was widely used instead of the earlier &quot;Romans&quot; by the 13th-century court of the Despotate to describe its population.

==Foundation==
The Epirote state was founded in 1205 by Michael Komnenos Doukas, a cousin of the Byzantine emperors Isaac II Angelos and Alexios III Angelos. At first, Michael allied with Boniface of Montferrat, but having lost the Morea (Peloponnese) to the Franks at the battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros, he went to Epirus, where he considered himself the Byzantine governor of the old province of Nicopolis and revolted against Boniface. Epirus soon became the new home of many refugees from Constantinople, Thessaly, and the Peloponnese, and Michael was described as a second Noah, rescuing men from the Latin flood. John X Kamateros, the Patriarch of Constantinople, did not consider him a legitimate successor and instead joined Theodore I Laskaris in Nicaea; Michael instead recognized the authority of Pope Innocent III over Epirus, cutting ties to the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Henry of Flanders demanded that Michael submit to the Latin Empire, which he did, at least nominally, by allowing his daughter to marry Henry&#x27;s brother Eustace in 1209. Michael did not honour this alliance, assuming that mountainous Epirus would be mostly impenetrable by any Latins with whom he made and broke alliances. Meanwhile, Boniface&#x27;s relatives from Montferrat made claims to Epirus as well, and in 1210 Michael allied with the Venetians and attacked Boniface&#x27;s Kingdom of Thessalonica. Pope Innocent III excommunicated him in response. Henry forced Michael into a renewed nominal alliance later that year.

Michael turned his attention to capturing other strategically important Latin-held towns, including Larissa and Dyrrhachium. He also took control of the ports on the Gulf of Corinth. In 1214 he captured Corcyra from Venice, but he was assassinated later that year and was succeeded by his half-brother Theodore.

==Conflict with Nicaea and Bulgaria==
Theodore Komnenos Doukas immediately set out to attack Thessalonica, and he fought with the Bulgarians along the way. Henry of Flanders died on the way to counterattack, and in 1217 Theodore captured his successor Peter of Courtenay, most likely executing him. The Latin Empire fell into disarray after losing the Battle of Poimanenon to the Nicaeans, and could not stop Theodore from capturing Thessalonica in 1224. Theodore now challenged Nicaea for the imperial title and crowned himself emperor, founding the short-lived Empire of Thessalonica. In 1225, after John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea had taken Adrianople, Theodore arrived and took it back from him. Theodore also allied with the Bulgarians and drove the Latins out of Thrace. In 1227 Theodore crowned himself Byzantine emperor, although this was not recognized by most Greeks, especially not the Patriarch in Nicaea.

In 1230 Theodore broke the truce with Bulgaria, hoping to remove Ivan Asen II, who had held him back from attacking Constantinople. In the battle of Klokotnitsa (near Haskovo in Bulgaria) the Bulgarian emperor defeated Theodore, capturing and later blinding him. His brother Manuel Komnenos Doukas took power in Thessalonica, but Epirus itself soon broke away under Michael I&#x27;s illegitimate son, Michael II Komnenos Doukas. Manuel awarded Michael the title of Despot—making Michael the first Epirote ruler to bear the title—as a sign of his nominal dependency on Thessalonica, but Michael was &quot;de facto&quot; independent, which he demonstrated by seizing Corfu in ca. 1236. In the rump Empire of Thessalonica, after Theodore was released in 1237, he overthrew his brother Manuel, and set up his son John Komnenos Doukas as ruler of Thessalonica.

==Nicaean and Byzantine suzerainty==


Thessalonica never regained its power after the battle of Klokotnitsa. Theodore&#x27;s younger son Demetrios Angelos Doukas lost Thessalonica to Nicaea in 1246 and Michael II of Epirus allied with the Latins against the Nicaeans. In 1248 John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea forced Michael to recognize him as emperor, and officially recognized him in turn as &quot;despotēs&quot; in Epirus. Vatatzes&#x27; granddaughter Maria later (in 1256) married Michael&#x27;s son Nikephoros, although she died in 1258. Also in 1248 Michael&#x27;s daughter Anna married William II, Prince of Achaea, and Michael decided to honour this alliance over his obligations to Vatatzes. The allies were defeated in the ensuing conflict at the Battle of Pelagonia in 1259.

Emperor Theodore II Laskaris allied with Michael II, and their children, betrothed by John years before, finally married in 1256, with Theodore receiving Dyrrhachium in return. Michael did not accept this transfer of land, and in 1257 he revolted, defeating a Nicaean army led by George Acropolites. As Michael marched on Thessalonica, he was attacked by King Manfred of Sicily, who conquered Albania and Corcyra. However, Michael immediately allied with him by marrying his daughter Helena to him. After Theodore II died, Michael, Manuel, and William II fought the new Nicaean emperor, Michael VIII Palaiologos. The alliance was very unstable and in 1259 William was captured at the disastrous Battle of Pelagonia. Michael VIII went on to capture Michael II&#x27;s capital of Arta, leaving Epirus with only Ioannina and Vonitsa. Arta was recovered by 1260 while Michael VIII was occupied against Constantinople.

==Italian invasions==
After Michael VIII restored the empire in Constantinople in 1261 he frequently harassed Epirus, and forced Michael&#x27;s son Nikephoros to marry his niece Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene in 1265. Michael considered Epirus a vassal state, although Michael II and Nikephoros continued to ally with the Princes of Achaea and the Dukes of Athens. In 1267 Corcyra and much of Epirus were taken by Charles of Anjou, and in 1267/68 Michael II died. Michael VIII did not attempt to annex Epirus directly, and allowed Nikephoros I to succeed his father and deal with Charles, who captured Dyrrhachium in 1271. In 1279 Nikephoros allied with Charles against Michael VIII, agreeing to become Charles&#x27; vassal. With Charles&#x27; defeat soon after Nikephoros lost Albania to the Byzantines.

Under Andronikos II Palaiologos, son of Michael VIII, Nikephoros renewed the alliance with Constantinople. Nikephoros, however, was persuaded to ally with Charles II of Naples in 1292, although Charles was defeated by Andronikos&#x27;s fleet. Nikephoros married his daughter to Charles&#x27;s son Philip I of Taranto and sold much of his territory to him. After Nikephoros&#x27;s death in c. 1297 Byzantine influence grew under his widow Anna, Andronikos&#x27;s cousin, who ruled as regent for her young son Thomas I Komnenos Doukas. In 1306 she revolted against Philip in favour of Andronikos; the Latin inhabitants were expelled but she was forced to return some territory to Philip. In 1312 Philip abandoned his claim to Epirus and claimed the defunct Latin Empire of Constantinople instead as the inheritance of his wife Catherine II of Valois, Princess of Achaea.

==Collapse of the despotate==
Anna succeeded in marrying off Thomas to a daughter of Michael IX, but Thomas was assassinated in 1318 by his cousin Nicholas Orsini, who married his widow and claimed to rule not only Epirus, but all of Greece; his rule was limited only to Akamania, or the southern part of Epirus. In 1323 he was overthrown by his brother John, who attempted to balance submission to Constantinople with cooperation with the Angevins of Naples, who also claimed Greece as part of their domains. John was poisoned around 1335 by his wife Anna, who became regent for their son Nikephoros II. In 1337 the new Emperor, Andronikos III Palaiologos, arrived in northern Epirus with an army partly composed of 2,000 Turks contributed by his ally Umur of Aydın. Andronikos first dealt with unrest due to attacks by Albanians and then turned his interest to the Despotate. Anna tried to negotiate and obtain the Despotate for her son when he came of age, but Andronikos demanded the complete surrender of the Despotate to which she finally agreed. Thus Epirus came peacefully under imperial rule, with Theodore Synadenos as governor.

The imperials had insisted that Nikephoros would be engaged to one of the daughters of the emperor&#x27;s right-hand man, John Kantakouzenos. When the time of the engagement came, Nikephoros had vanished. Andronikos learned that Nikephoros had fled to Italy, with the help of members of the Epirote aristocracy who supported an independent Epirus. He stayed in Taranto, Italy, in the court of Catherine II of Valois (Philip of Taranto&#x27;s widow), the titular empress of Constantinople.

In 1339 a revolt began, supported by Catherine of Valois, who had previously moved to the Peloponnese, and by Nikephoros who had returned to Epirus, based in Thomokastron. By the end of the year the imperial army returned to the area, and in the following year, 1340, Andronikos III himself arrived together with John Kantakouzenos. Nikephoros was persuaded through diplomacy to recognize the authority of the emperor. He surrendered Thomokastron, married Maria Kantakouzene, the daughter of John Kantakouzenos, and received the title of &quot;panhypersebastos&quot;.

The Empire soon fell into a civil war between John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos, and Epirus was conquered by the Serbian tsar Stefan Dušan in 1348, who appointed his brother, despot Simeon Nemanjić-Palailogos as governor of the province. Nikephoros II took advantage of the Byzantine civil war and the death of Dušan (1355) to escape and to reestablish himself in Epirus in 1356, to which he also added Thessaly. Nikephoros was killed in battle putting down an Albanian revolt in 1359, and the territory of the former despotate became a component part of the personal Empire of Dušan&#x27;s brother Simeon Nemanjić-Palailogos. Simeon was also governing Thessaly at the time, and, as the &quot;Chronicle of Ioannina&quot; shows, he left much of the territory under the control of Albanian clans establishing short-lived entities: the clan of Pjetër Losha held Arta, and the clan of Muriq Shpata held Aetoloacarnania, with Angelokastron as its capital.

In 1367 a part of the Epirotan Despotate was resurrected under local Serbian nobleman Thomas II Preljubović, who kept Ioannina. After Thomas&#x27; death in 1384, his widow remarried in 1385 and transferred the Despotate to homage of Italian nobility. The state tradition was carried on by the Serbian and Italian rulers of Ioannina, who solicited aid from the Ottoman Turks against the Albanians. In 1399 the Albanian leader of Principality of Gjirokastër, Gjon Zenebishi captured the Despot Esau de&#x27; Buondelmonti and released him after 15 months, when his relatives in Italy offered a huge amount of money as a ransom. By 1416 the Tocco family of Cephalonia succeeded in reuniting Epirus, or at least in asserting their control over its towns. 

But internal dissension eased the Ottoman conquest, which proceeded with the capture of Ioannina in 1430, Arta in 1449, Angelokastron in 1460, and finally Vonitsa in 1479. During the Ottoman conquest of the Despotate of Epirus, the islands of Santa Mavra, Cephalonia and Ithaka, the ducal officials were &quot;cut to pieces&quot;, the castle of Cephalonia was burned and the peasantry was enslaved and taken to Constantinople as a gift to the sultan, who engaged in &quot;slave breeding&quot; by separating husbands and wives and &quot;mating&quot; them with Ehtiopian slaves with the purpose of &quot;producing a race of grey slaves&quot;, while other slaves from St Mavra were sold by Ahmed Pascha for ten soldi apiece to slavery in the Ottoman Empire. 
With the exception of several coastal Venetian possessions, this was the end of Frankish rule in mainland Greece.

<doc id="652534" wikidata="Q375775" url="?curid=652534" title="The Medallion">
<text>The Medallion () is a 2003 buddy action comedy film directed by Hong Kong film director Gordon Chan, who also wrote the screenplay with Bennett Joshua Davlin, Bey Logan, Paul Wheeler, and Alfred Cheung, who also produced.

The film stars Jackie Chan, Lee Evans, Claire Forlani, and Julian Sands. It was much less successful than Chan&#x27;s other American films such as the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; film series, &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot;. The film was theatrically released on 15 August 2003 in Hong Kong and 22 August 2003 in the United States by TriStar Pictures. However, on the home media release, it was released by Screen Gems.

In the story, Eddie (Jackie Chan) is a Hong Kong police officer hired by Interpol to capture a crime lord known as Snakehead (Sands) and stop him from kidnapping a chosen boy with special powers and a medallion that gives superhuman power and immortality.

Much of the film features supernatural and mystical themes, though it is filled with action and comedy. The film received negative reviews from critics. Even though the film&#x27;s United States box office result was strong enough for Sony/TriStar Pictures to make profit, the film performed poorly at the worldwide box-office, and only grossed $34.3 million in worldwide box office against $35‒41 million production budget.

==Plot==
Eddie Yang is a Hong Kong police inspector cooperating with Interpol in the capture of a crime lord named AJ &quot;Snakehead&quot; Staul. Snakehead procures an ancient book from a Chinese bookstore keeper, which tells the story of a boy chosen every thousand years to bind the two halves of a legendary medallion. In Hong Kong, Eddie and Interpol agent Arthur Watson led a raid to capture Snakehead and his men, who were about to kidnap the boy named Jai. Eddie and the agents fight off Snakehead&#x27;s men, infiltrating the temple containing Jai. The agents save Jai, but Snakehead eludes them. Two weeks later, Snakehead captures Jai aboard a cargo boat in Hong Kong. Eddie and a team of Hong Kong police engage and defeat several of Snakehead&#x27;s men, but Snakehead escapes with Jai to Dublin, Ireland.

In Ireland, Eddie was assigned to help Interpol with the investigation, much to Watson&#x27;s annoyance. Eddie also reunites with his girlfriend, a British Interpol agent named Nicole James. By chance, Eddie later encounters and apprehends one of Snakehead&#x27;s top men, who confesses Jai gets held in the harbor. Eddie, Watson, and Nicole move to rescue Jai, defeating several Snakehead agents. Eddie and Jai end up trapped inside a container, which is knocked into the water by one of Snakehead&#x27;s men before they can be released. Eddie keeps Jai alive by finding an inflatable tent and securely putting Jai inside, but Eddie suddenly dies from drowning. After being saved, Jai uses his medallion on Eddie&#x27;s body.

In the morgue, Watson grieves over Eddie&#x27;s body and prepares to say his last words, but Eddie appears beside him. Eddie finds out that Jai used the medallion to bring him back to life, and his former body vanishes into dust. Jai splits the medallion into its two halves, giving one of them to Eddie. Snakehead&#x27;s men appear in the hospital to recapture Jai, and during the fight, Eddie discovers the medallion has also granted him superhuman strength and immortality.

Nicole looks after Jai, but he is captured again by Snakehead. At his castle hideout, Snakehead forces Jai to activate the medallion so he can gain its power with only one-half of it; Snakehead only gains superhuman strength and remains mortal. To steal the other half, Snakehead and his men attack Watson&#x27;s family. Watson&#x27;s Chinese wife reveals herself to be a police operative like him, much to Watson&#x27;s surprise, as he kept his job secret from his family. Together, they fight off the attack from Snakehead&#x27;s men.

Eddie, Watson, and Nicole learn the location of Snakehead&#x27;s castle lair and go to finish him once and for all. The operation runs smoothly, but Snakehead kills Nicole and becomes immortal. He and Eddie engage in a vicious fight until Eddie uses the medallion to take away the life it gave, leading to the serpent and fish from the medallion appearing and bringing Snakehead, which traps him in the medallion. Jai allows Eddie to use the medallion to resurrect Nicole, who gains super-strength and immortality. The two then run in superhuman speed into the distance as Jai enters another dimension through a portal, scaring Watson.

==Production==

With a projected budget of $35 million, the film was at the time the most expensive Hong Kong production ever, making Bennett Joshua Davlin the highest paid screenwriter in Asia.

===Original plot and conception===
&quot;Highbinders&quot; was the film&#x27;s working title. In the original plot, those who were given power by the medallion became Highbinders, and Snakehead&#x27;s goal was to create a Highbinder army at his disposal.

According to the editors&#x27; commentary, &quot;The Medallion&quot; wasn&#x27;t American-made. However, Columbia-TriStar bought the distribution and editing rights worldwide except in Japan, France, and Hong Kong (but these three countries retain the American cut of the film, the only cut ever made). The original cut was meant to be around 108 minutes. The plot of the film explained Snakehead&#x27;s crime syndicate of human smuggling, the deaths that occurred from it, and his desire to create an army of Highbinders to aid his organization. These details were all cut to focus on the medallion. As a result of several scene cuts, some original dialogue was overdubbed, including a small amount of Cantonese dialogue.

Over 20 minutes of these deleted scenes can be viewed on the U.S. DVD. Among these scenes are alternate endings where Eddie prevents Nicole&#x27;s death, an extended fight sequence between Eddie and Snakehead&#x27;s men, and an alternate ending to the chase sequence between Eddie and Giscard.

===Filming===
Filming took place in August 2001 in Dublin, Ireland. Production took a break while Jackie Chan shot &#x27;The Tuxedo&#x27;, and production resumed in Asia later that year. Filming took place in Dublin Castle, and in the Wicklow countryside. The filmmakers had initially planned to shoot scenes in Australia but were convinced to film in Dublin instead.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its US release, &quot;The Medallion&quot; was No. 5 at the box office on its opening weekend and fell steadily lower during its 10-week release. Overall, it has earned $22.2 million, ranking No. 42 among all martial arts films released in the US and eighth among the Jackie Chan films distributed in the US. The US box office performance had exceeded Sony/TriStar Pictures&#x27; profitability target (&#x27;mid-teens&#x27; box office target).

===Critical response===
The film received generally negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 17% based on reviews from 125 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;The use of special effects diminishes some of Chan&#x27;s appeal in this disposable picture.&quot;
On Metacritic the film has a score of 38% based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. 
Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B.
* Mick LaSalle, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;: &quot;The best of Jackie Chan&#x27;s American movies, a pleasant little action comedy that makes one wonder how other filmmakers could ever get it wrong.&quot;
* Roger Ebert, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;: &quot;A disposable entertainment, redeemed by silliness, exaggeration, and Chan&#x27;s skill and charm. I would not want to see it twice, but I liked seeing it once.&quot; Ebert called it an improvement over &quot;The Tuxedo&quot; but not as good as &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot;.
* Steven Rea, &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;: &quot;Chan&#x27;s signature mix of screwball comedy and gymnastic derring-do landed him his own cartoon series a few years back, and &quot;The Medallion&quot; -- with its bumbling spies and bounding star -- is about as cartoonish as live action gets.&quot;

* Dennis Harvey, &quot;Variety&quot;: &quot;At times plays as if it were aimed at children, but more often simply seems to be aiming blind at whatever genre cliche the five credited writers fix upon in any given scene.&quot;
* Wesley Morris, &quot;Boston Globe&quot;: &quot;Moves from cheekiness to ineptitude, often in a single take.&quot;
* Jami Bernard, &quot;New York Daily News&quot;: &quot;Evans fumbles through painfully extended homophobic jokes, weak double entendres and agonizingly contorted double-takes.&quot;
* Marc Savlov, &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot;: &quot;One of the Peking Opera-trained superstar&#x27;s most mediocre films, rivaling last year&#x27;s God-awful &quot;The Tuxedo&quot; for sheer messy filmmaking and brazen acts of tedium... Abysmal.&quot;

===Accolades===
* 23rd Hong Kong Film Awards
** Nomination: Best Action Choreography (Sammo Hung)
** Nomination: Best Visual Effects (Matthew Gidney)

<text>Rush Hour 2 is a 2001 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Brett Ratner and written by Jeff Nathanson. A sequel to &quot;Rush Hour&quot; (1998), it is the second installment in the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; franchise and stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker reprising their roles from the first film. The story follows Chief Inspector Lee (Chan) and LAPD Detective James Carter (Tucker), who go to Hong Kong on vacation only to be thwarted by a murder case involving two U.S. customs agents after a bombing at the American embassy. Lee suspects that the crime is linked to the Triad crime lord Ricky Tan (Lone).

&quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; opened on August 3, 2001, to generally mixed reviews. The film was a commercial success, grossing $347.3 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise. It also became the year&#x27;s fifth-highest-grossing film domestically in the United States, as well as the second-highest-grossing PG-13-rated film. A sequel, &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;, was released on August 10, 2007.

==Plot==
A few years after rescuing a Chinese diplomat&#x27;s daughter, LAPD Detective James Carter is in Hong Kong on vacation with his friend, Hong Kong Police Force Chief Inspector Lee. His vacation is put on hold when a bomb at the US Consulate General kills two undercover US Customs agents. Lee is assigned to the case and discovers that his late father&#x27;s police partner, Ricky Tan, is somehow involved. Lee and Carter attempt to question Ricky, now a Triad leader, at a massage parlor, resulting in a brawl with his bodyguards forcing Lee and Carter to flee through Hong Kong while completely naked.

The U.S. Secret Service, led by Agent Sterling, and the Hong Kong Police Force fight over jurisdiction of the case. Lee&#x27;s office is bombed and Lee, unaware Carter has left the building, believes him dead. They reunite at a party on Ricky&#x27;s yacht, where Ricky scolds his underling, Hu Li. Lee and Carter confront Ricky, who claims he is being framed by his enemies and asks for protection, but Hu Li shoots him and escapes. Sterling holds Lee responsible for Ricky&#x27;s death and orders him off the case. Carter is ordered back to Los Angeles, but convinces Lee to return to Los Angeles with him after realizing how personal this case is for Lee after he reveals Tan&#x27;s history with his father, leading up until his death.

Carter assures Lee that every large criminal operation has a rich white man behind it; in this case, he believes that man is Steven Reign, a billionaire Los Angeles hotelier he saw acting suspiciously at Ricky Tan&#x27;s party. Staking out Reign Towers, they spot Isabella Molina, whom Carter met on Ricky&#x27;s yacht, receiving a delivery from Hu Li. Mistaking the package for another bomb, Lee and Carter try to intervene, but Molina reveals she is an undercover U.S. Secret Service agent, looking into Reign&#x27;s laundering of $100 million in superdollars, with the only difference being that they burn with a red color unlike real dollars.

Lee and Carter visit Kenny, an ex-con, now Carter&#x27;s informant who runs a gambling den in the back of his Chinese restaurant. He tells them about a customer with a suspicious amount of hundred-dollar bills, which Carter confirms are Reign&#x27;s counterfeits. They trace the money to a bank, where they are captured by Hu Li and the Triads. Taken to Las Vegas in a Triad truck, Lee and Carter escape, realizing that Reign is laundering the $100 million through his new Red Dragon Casino. At the Red Dragon, Molina points Lee to the engraving plates used to print the counterfeit money, while Carter creates a distraction to help Lee sneak past security. Hu Li captures Lee, taping a Ying Tao grenade in his mouth before bringing him to Ricky, who is still alive. When Ricky departs, Molina tries to arrest Hu Li but is shot, and Lee and Carter manage to remove the grenade before Hu Li detonates it, evacuating the casino.

Carter fights Hu Li, accidentally knocking her out with a spear, while Lee pursues Ricky. In the casino&#x27;s penthouse, Reign prepares to escape with the plates but Ricky fatally stabs him. Lee and Carter confront Ricky, who admits to killing Lee&#x27;s father. In the ensuing scuffle, Ricky falls to his death when Lee accidentally kicks him out of a window, avenging Lee&#x27;s father&#x27;s death. Hu Li enters the room with a time bomb, forcing Lee and Carter to escape on a makeshift zip line as Hu Li dies in the explosion.

Later at McCarran International Airport, Sterling and Molina thank Lee for his work on the case and Molina kisses him. Planning to go their separate ways when Lee gives Carter his late father&#x27;s police badge after finally finding closure for his father&#x27;s death, Lee and Carter change their minds when Carter reveals the large amount of money he won at Caesar&#x27;s Palace. The pair head to New York City to indulge themselves while performing a victory dance to Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop &#x27;Til You Get Enough&quot;.

==Production==
===Filming===
Filming took place between December 11, 2000 and April 30, 2001.

===Fake-money controversy===
The prop masters for the film created approximately $1trillion in fake money to be used as props in the film. The money was realistic enough that some of the film&#x27;s extras pocketed it and attempted to spend it illegally outside of the production, which led to said fake money being confiscated and destroyed by the U.S. Secret Service.

==Music==
Lalo Schifrin returned to compose the score for the film. According to him, &quot;The music for &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; is completely different from &quot;Rush Hour&quot;. The first 20–30 seconds of the main title is a reprise of the music from &quot;Rush Hour&quot; – but that&#x27;s it.&quot; He said that Ratner had requested a &quot;symphonic score&quot;, which he incidentally found suitable for &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;:
For the sequel, he asked me to do a symphonic score. It was bigger than life – like an epic score. I ignored the comedy – the actors took care of that. I played to the chases and the danger. It&#x27;s a serious score in the sense of an &quot;epic&quot; score, like &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; or an Errol Flynn film. Also, you must realize that the symphony orchestra allows many more possibilities. Mozart didn&#x27;t need a rhythm section to &quot;drive&quot;. I was able to create a lot of energy without the use of drums and electric guitars and all that.
Schifrin performed the &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony. Varèse Sarabande released the soundtrack album on compact disc in August 2001. In a 2001 interview with Dan Goldwasser for Soundtrack.Net, Schifrin was asked whether he would score &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;, and he stated: &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m not a prophet!&quot; By 2007, he began composing the score for &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;, which , is his last motion picture score.

==Release==
Before its August 3 release, &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; premiered on July 26, 2001, on-board the United Airlines Flight 1 from Los Angeles to Hong Kong renamed, &quot;The Rush Hour Express&quot;. The Hong Kong Board of Tourism teamed up with United Airlines and New Line Cinema in a campaign that offered both trailers for the movie for passengers on all domestic United flights during July and August reaching an expected three million people, as well as Hong Kong travel videos to inspire tourists to visit the country where the film was set.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; earned $226.2 million in North America and an estimated $121.2 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $347.3 million (surpassing &quot;Rush Hour&quot; and &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;″s worldwide box-office receipts). The film was ranked number one during its opening weekend, grossing $67.4 million at 3,118 locations. The film stayed in the Top 10 until October 11 (10 weeks total). It became one of the four 2001 films to generate $60 million in their first three days of release, with the others being &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. The film also had the fourth-highest opening weekend of all time, behind the latter two films and &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; achieved two other records during its opening weekend, beating &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; for having the biggest August opening weekend and &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; for scoring the largest opening weekend for a New Line Cinema film. The August opening weekend record would be held for six years before being surpassed by &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; in 2007. &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; would hold the record for having the highest opening weekend for a comedy film until 2002 when &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; surpassed it. Despite being overtaken by &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, the film made $31.5 million during its second weekend. It was 2001&#x27;s second-highest-grossing rated PG-13 film and the 11th highest-grossing film worldwide. &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; surpassed the 1984 film &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; as the highest-grossing martial arts action film, and was ranked as the second-highest-grossing buddy comedy film, behind the 1997 film &quot;Men in Black&quot;. The film was also ranked as the third-highest-grossing second installment in a live action comedy film franchise (behind the 2004 film &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; and the 2011 film &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot;).

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; were mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 51% based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh or funny as the first, and the stunts lack some of the intricacy normally seen in Chan&#x27;s films.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 48 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore during &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; opening weekend gave the film an average grade of A on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave it one and half stars out of a possible four calling Chris Tucker &quot;an anchor around the ankles of the humor&quot; in the movie. Conversely Robert Koehler of Variety called it a &quot;superior sequel&quot; and &quot;the very model of the limber, transnational Hollywood action comedy&quot;.

===Awards===
&quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; earned 27 award nominations and 10 wins, including an MTV Movie Award for Best Fight, a Teen Choice Award for Film-Choice Actor, Comedy, and 3 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards: Favorite Movie Actor for Tucker, Favorite Male Butt Kicker for Chan, and Favorite Movie.

==Sequel==

Because of various issues during development hell and production, &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot; wasn&#x27;t released until August 10, 2007; six years after &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;. &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot; failed to receive the critical and commercial acclaim of its predecessors, but was still a box office success.

<doc id="652550" wikidata="Q471540" url="?curid=652550" title="John D. Barrow">
<text>John David Barrow (29 November 1952 – 26 September 2020) was an English cosmologist, theoretical physicist, and mathematician. He served as Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College from 2008 to 2011. Barrow was also a writer of popular science and an amateur playwright.

==Education==
Barrow attended Barham Primary School in Wembley until 1964 and Ealing Grammar School for Boys from 1964 to 1971 and obtained his first degree in mathematics and physics from Van Mildert College at the University of Durham in 1974. In 1977, he completed his doctorate in astrophysics at Magdalen College, Oxford, supervised by Dennis William Sciama.

==Career and research==
Barrow was a Junior Research Lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford, from 1977 to 1981. He completed two postdoctoral years as a Miller Research Fellow in astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, as a Commonwealth Lindemann Fellow (1977–8) and Miller Fellow (1980–1).

In 1981 he joined the University of Sussex and rose to become Professor and Director of the Astronomy Centre. In 1999, he became Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and a fellow in Clare Hall at Cambridge University. From 2003 to 2007 he was Gresham Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, London, and he was appointed as Gresham Professor of Geometry from 2008 to 2011; only one person has previously held two different Gresham chairs.

From 1999, he directed the Millennium Mathematics Project (MMP) at the University of Cambridge. This is an outreach and education programme to improve the appreciation, teaching and learning of mathematics and its applications. In 2006 it was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for Educational Achievement by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.

In addition to having published more than 500 journal articles, Barrow co-wrote (with Frank J. Tipler) &quot;The Anthropic Cosmological Principle&quot;, a work on the history of the ideas, specifically intelligent design and teleology, as well as a treatise on astrophysics. He also published 22 books for general readers, beginning with his 1983 &quot;The Left Hand of Creation&quot;. His books summarise the state of the affairs of physical questions, often in the form of compendia of a large number of facts assembled from the works of great physicists, such as Paul Dirac and Arthur Eddington.

Barrow&#x27;s approach to philosophical issues posed by physical cosmology made his books accessible to general readers. For example, Barrow introduced a memorable paradox, which he called &quot;the Groucho Marx Effect&quot; (see Russell-like paradoxes). Here, he quotes Groucho Marx: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to belong to any club that would accept me as a member&quot;. Applying this to problems in cosmology, Barrow stated: &quot;A universe simple enough to be understood is too simple to produce a mind capable of understanding it&quot;.

Barrow lectured at 10 Downing Street, Windsor Castle, and the Vatican, as well as to the general public. In 2002, his play &quot;Infinities&quot; premiered in Milan, played in Valencia, and won the Premi Ubu 2002 Italian Theatre Prize.

==Honours==
Barrow was awarded the 2006 Templeton Prize for &quot;Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities&quot; for his &quot;writings about the relationship between life and the universe, and the nature of human understanding [which] have created new perspectives on questions of ultimate concern to science and religion&quot;. He was a member of a United Reformed Church, which he described as teaching &quot;a traditional deistic picture of the universe&quot;.

In 2008, the Royal Society awarded him the Faraday Prize. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (London) in 2003 and elected Fellow of the Academia Europaea in 2009. He has received Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of Hertfordshire, Sussex, Durham, South Wales, and Szczecin, and was an Honorary Professor at the University of Nanjing. He was an Honorary Fellow of Van Mildert College (Durham University) and of Gresham College (London). He was a Centenary Gifford Lecturer at the University of Glasgow in 1989.

He was awarded the Dirac Prize and Gold Medal of the Institute of Physics in 2015 and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2016.

== Barrow scale ==
The Barrow scale proposed by him is a measurement of the technological level and mastery of civilizations based upon the smallest structures that they can manipulate. It is a complement to the Kardashev scale, which is based upon the largest structures that can be manipulated.

==Death==
Barrow died on 26 September 2020 from colon cancer, at the age of 67.

<text>CityJet is an Irish regional airline with headquarters at Dublin Airport. It was founded in 1992 and has gone through a series of corporate structures. The airline was sold to Air France in 2000 and then by Air France to &quot;Intro Aviation&quot; in May 2014; in March 2016 the airline was bought by founder Pat Byrne and other investors. CityJet ended its own-brand scheduled services in 2018 and is now a major provider of wet leasing to European airlines. As of Summer 2023, CityJet operates wet lease services on behalf of Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and Scandinavian Airlines.

Over 450 of CityJet&#x27;s 600+ staff are employed in Copenhagen in both flying and ground roles, making CityJet one of the most significant airline employers in Denmark, with further crew employed in Sweden. In addition to its head office at Dublin Airport and crew planning centre in Luton, CityJet has a maintenance hangar and offices in Copenhagen Kastrup Airport.

==History==
===Early years===

Cityjet was founded in 1992 as Business City Direct and commenced operations in December 1993. In January 1994 it started a single route between Dublin and London City Airport under a franchise agreement with Virgin Atlantic, in which it paid fees and charges to Virgin in order to operate as Virgin Cityjet and use Virgin Atlantic&#x27;s distribution channels. The airline was mainly competing with British Midland and Aer Lingus services from Dublin to London Heathrow and Ryanair services from Dublin to London Stansted. However, Cityjet held a monopoly on services to London City until Aer Lingus launched services from Dublin to London City in September 1999.

In June 1995, Virgin Cityjet debuted with flights between Dublin and Brussels, competing with Sabena and Aer Lingus initially.

In 1996, the airline terminated its franchise agreement with Virgin Atlantic on short notice and decided to continue operations using its own CityJet name from the end of July that year. By then, the airline flew scheduled flights from Dublin to London City, Brussels and Malaga. The decision to discontinue the Virgin Atlantic franchise came as Virgin itself entered the European short-haul market with budget carrier Virgin Express, and CityJet feared customers could confuse the low-cost carrier with its own full-service operation.

===1999-2014: Air France era===

In 1999, Cityjet was at the verge of bankruptcy. Air Foyle acquired half of the shares in the airline in return for assuming the carrier&#x27;s debts. Air France took another 25 percent while investing £2 million. Under the new structure, Cityjet retained its own scheduled services while also becoming Air France&#x27;s principal European subcontract airline. However, Cityjet still remained a loss-making business. 
In early 2000, Air France took over all shares in CityJet and became its sole owner. At the time, Cityjet already operated seven out of eight of its aircraft for Air France. The French national airline was allowed to outsource operations of aircraft with less than 100 seats to regional partners and subsidiaries under its contracts with Air France&#x27; labour unions; overall savings to Air France by outsourcing regional operations to the Irish subsidiary were estimated at around 40 percent.

In 2006, Cityjet operated supplemented Air France&#x27;s operations with flights from Paris to Dublin, Birmingham, Edinburgh, London City, Florence, Gothenburg and Zurich. Furthermore, the airline still operated between London City and Dublin. The fleet consisted of 20 aged BAe 146 aircraft. From December 2006, the airline began replacing them with 23 much younger but similar Avro RJ85s it had acquired in a $221 million deal from Mesaba Airlines.

On 24 December 2007, Air France-KLM announced that it had signed an agreement for a full takeover of VLM Airlines NV from Panta Holdings, and announced on 28 May 2009 that VLM Airlines would gradually start to operate under the brand name CityJet. As of 1 June 2010, the whole VLM Airlines Fokker 50 fleet wore full CityJet livery, although VLM remained the owner of its own Airline Operators Certificate, and the Fokker 50 fleet was listed on the Belgian registry.

CityJet filed a pretax loss of €51.5 million for the year to the end of March 2010. This compared to a €53.9 million loss in the year to end March 2009. Revenues fell by 8 percent from €282.4 million to €258.9 million over the same period. Passenger numbers grew, climbing by 6.5 percent to 2.1 million, while average fares dropped by 16 percent. Christine Ourmières joined as new chief executive on 1 October 2010. She had previously held a number of senior posts within the Air France-KLM group. In the IATA year ending 31 March 2010, CityJet carried just over 1 million passengers on its London City network.
In June 2012 it was announced that Air France-KLM was considering selling CityJet to support its own ailing business, with a further statement in April 2013 that the winning bidder would be announced in the summer of 2013.

As of October 2013 the operational agreement with Air France had been replaced by codesharing, with most routes operated under its own &quot;WX&quot; code instead of Air France&#x27;s. In December 2013 Air France announced it would sell CityJet, including VLM Airlines, to German investor &quot;Intro Aviation&quot;. The transfer was completed in May 2014. CityJet subsidiary VLM Airlines was bought by its own management and cut itself loose from CityJet. However, they were to remain flying the London City to Antwerp route as an ACMI operator for CityJet until mid-2016.

=== 2015-2018: Transition to ACMI ===
In October 2015, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) announced it would sell its Finnish subsidiary Blue1 to CityJet and that CityJet would provide wet lease services to SAS from March 2016, with CityJet placing an order for up to 14 new Bombardier CRJ900 jets, 8 firm and six options. Four of the options were later confirmed. In 2016 Blue1 was dissolved and merged into its parent CityJet.On 28 June 2016, CityJet inaugurated its Sukhoi Superjet 100 revenue services with its first scheduled flight from Cork to Nantes. CityJet commenced a wet lease contract with Brussels Airlines using the Superjet in March 2017.

In January 2017, CityJet agreed to buy Cimber, which had a fleet of 11 CRJ900s, from SAS. In addition to the acquisition of Cimber, CityJet secured a long term wet lease contract with SAS and placed an order leading to a further ten CRJ900 jets to replace those operated by Cimber, bringing it to a total of 22 new CRJ900 aircraft operating in total for SAS. 

In March 2017, CityJet stated that it planned to focus more on its wetlease business while reducing its own scheduled flights. This led to the closure of routes from London City to Nantes and Paris as well as a downgrade of frequencies on other routes. CityJet then planned to operate 80 percent of all flights on a wetlease basis. On 5 April 2017, it was announced that KLM Cityhopper would wet lease two Avro RJ85s from CityJet to operate four additional Amsterdam–London City services per weekday over the Summer 2017 season, starting 15 May 2017. In late October 2017, CityJet cancelled most of its remaining routes from London City Airport, leaving Dublin as its only scheduled destination from there after operating a much larger network in previous years.

In July 2018, it was announced that CityJet and Air Nostrum would merge. This merger received EU approval in 2019 but was deferred during Covid before being reactivated in 2022, with completion expected in 2023.

In late August 2018, CityJet announced they would cease operating scheduled services under their own brand, effective from 27 October 2018, but continue business as an ACMI leasing provider. 

=== 2018-Present: ACMI ===
At the end of October 2018, CityJet commenced a wet lease agreement with Aer Lingus, operating two Avro RJ85 aircraft primarily on the Dublin to London City route.

In 2019, CityJet pulled all Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft from service due to insufficient operational reliability and returned them to their lessor, replacing these aircraft with CRJ900 jets on the wet lease contract with Brussels Airlines.

In 2019, Cityjet partnered with KLM to create Air Antwerp, a new airline based in Antwerp International Airport. It operated daily flights to London City Airport from 9 September 2019. In May 2021 CityJet handed its 75% share of Air Antwerp over to co-owner KLM but the airline ceased operations in June 2021.

In April 2020, Brussels Airlines cancelled its wetlease contract with CityJet for five aircraft in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Aer Lingus wet lease agreement also ended at this time due to market uncertainty. In the same month the High Court appointed an interim examiner to CityJet. CityJet exited the Examinership process in August 2020 after financial restructuring

After a brief pause at the start of the Covid pandemic, CityJet recommenced wet lease services on behalf of Scandinavian Airlines in June 2020 and progressively built up to the operation of 18 CRJ900 for SAS by 2022.

In March 2023, CityJet took delivery of the first of five Bombardier CRJ1000 100-seat regional jets to supplement its fleet of 21 CRJ900s, with the first two flying on a wet lease contract with Lufthansa. A new wet lease contract with Brussels Airlines commenced in March 2023 for the upcoming 2023 summer season using two CRJ900 jets.

In March 2024, Lufthansa wet-leased 5 Bombardier CRJ1000s from CityJet until the end of October for the upcoming 2024 summer season.

<doc id="652563" wikidata="Q1196727" url="?curid=652563" title="Direct election">
<text>Direct election is a system of choosing political officeholders in which the voters directly cast ballots for the persons or political party that they wanted to see elected. The method by which the winner or winners of a direct election are chosen depends upon the electoral system used. The most commonly used systems are the plurality system and the two-round system for single-winner elections, such as a presidential election, and proportional representation for the election of a legislature or executive.

By contrast, in an indirect election, the voters elect a body which in turn elects the officeholder in question. 

In a double direct election, the elected representative serves on two councils, typically a lower-tier municipality and an upper-tier regional district or municipality.

== Examples ==

=== Legislatures ===

* The European Parliament has been directly elected every five years since 1979. Member states determine how to elect their representatives, but, among other requirements, they must be directly elected.
* The United States House of Representatives has been directly elected, using either first-past-the-post voting or ticket voting in plural district since its inception in 1789.
* The United States Senate begin directly electing senators in 1914—after the passage and ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

=== Heads of state ===

* The president of France has been directly elected with the two-round system since the 1962 French presidential election referendum.
* The president of the Philippines is elected by national popular vote in elections.
* The president of Turkey has been directly elected with the two-round system since the 2007 Turkish constitutional referendum.

== History of direct presidential elections ==
The idea that heads of state be elected directly by the people progressed slowly throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This differs from parliamentary systems where executives derive power from the legislative body.

=== Africa ===
Many African nations have moved from parliamentary to presidential systems. Regardless of constitutional structures, presidents often have immense power over other political decision-making bodies. Given this power, much of the political violence around elections stems from the elections of presidents. Additionally, recent coups and conflict have postponed direct presidential elections in several African countries.

=== Asia ===
The overwhelming majority of democracies in Asia are parliamentary, rather than presidential systems. Based on constitutional design, the Philippines is the only head of state elected by popular vote. Although classified as a semi-presidential system, South Korea in political reality has a strong presidential system as well based on changes in 1987 to its constitution.

=== Europe ===
The first major European country to use direct elections was France (1848). However, if no candidate received a majority of the vote the National Assembly chose the winner from the top five candidates. As the so-called Second Republic only lasted for one presidential term, this never happened. Germany (the Weimar Republic) was the first European country to use direct election of a president without intervention by the legislature. Both these systems were replaced by authoritarian systems within a number of years, with indirect presidential elections instated with the restoration of democracy (in 1871 and 1949, in West Germany, respectively). Currently, Europe has a mix of parliamentary republics, presidential republics, where the president is elected directly by the people, and semi-presidential republics - including contemporary France - which have a president elected directly and a prime minister responsible to the parliament.

==== Colonial legacies ====
A major debate exists regarding colonial legacies and the promotion of democracy around the world. In terms of direct elections, former British colonies are less likely to hold direct elections for heads of state. Additionally no monarchies have direct elections for head of state since by definition the head of state is unelected.

=== North America ===
==== United States ====
The conceptual origins of direct presidential elections stem from the U.S. Constitution (1787) through the Electoral College. The Framers intended for a small group of electors, through methods determined by each state, to elect the president. Thus in practice this represents a form of indirect election.

=== South America ===
Bolstered by opposition groups, institutional and constitutional change in the 1980s and 1990s led to direct elections of presidents in many South American countries. These changes created centralized power in presidential positions, often blurring the line of separation of powers and making them powerful decision-makers over the legislature and cabinet.

== Advantages and disadvantages of directly electing the head of state ==
A common political debate, particularly as countries consider governmental reforms, is whether or not direct elections of heads of state strengthen democratic practices among citizens. Selection mechanisms for heads of state can lead to varying outcomes in terms of voter interest, turnout, and overall engagement. For example, some scholars argue that direct elections will mobilize voters and increase their trust in the political process, particularly in emerging democracies. Others note that frequent direct elections may decrease turnout due to voter fatigue and apathy.

== Direct elections in legislatures and parliaments ==

=== Legislatures ===

* The European Parliament has been directly elected every five years since 1979. Member states determine how to elect their representatives, but, among other requirements, they must be directly elected.
* The United States House of Representatives has been directly elected using either first-past-the-post voting or ticket voting in plural district since its inception in 1789.
* The United States Senate begin directly electing senators in 1914—after the passage and ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

<text>The center (C), or the centre, also known as the five, the big or the pivot, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. The center is almost always the tallest player on the team, and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well. In the NBA, the center is typically close to tall; centers in the WNBA are typically above . Centers traditionally play close to the basket in the low post. The two tallest players in NBA history, Manute Bol and Gheorghe Mureșan, were both centers, each standing tall.

Centers are valued for their ability to protect their own goal from high-percentage close attempts on defense, while scoring and rebounding with high efficiency on offense. In the 1950s and 1960s, George Mikan and Bill Russell were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers. With the addition of a three-point field goal for the 1979–80 season, however, NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of a traditional center diminish. Modern day big men include elite playmakers and passers such as Nikola Jokic and versatile scorers such as Joel Embiid and Victor Wembanyama.

==History==

=== 1940s–1950s: Emergence and George Mikan era ===

The center is considered a necessary component for a successful team, especially in professional leagues such as the NBA. Great centers have been the foundation for most of the dynasties in both the NBA and NCAA. Until the 1940s, even dominant centers such as Moose Krause were not extraordinary tall. Then, the George Mikan and the Bob Kurland pioneered as exceptionally tall centers, shattering the widely held perception that tall players could not develop the agility and coordination to play basketball well, and ushering in the role of the dominant big man. While Kurland never played professional basketball after his time at Oklahoma State, Mikan turned professional in 1946 after leading DePaul to the NIT title. He went on to win seven National Basketball League, Basketball Association of America and NBA Championships in his ten-year career (1946–56), nine of them with the Minneapolis Lakers. Using his height to dominate opposing players, Mikan invented the hook shot and the shot block; as a consequence, the NCAA, and later NBA, adopted the goaltending rule, and in 1951 the NBA widened the foul lane, a decision known as the Mikan rule.

=== 1960s: Bill Russell–Wilt Chamberlain era ===

In the 1960s, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain further transformed basketball by combining height with a greater level of athleticism than previous centers. Following the retirement of George Mikan, the rivalry of the two big men came to dominate the NBA. Between the two of them, Chamberlain and Russell won nine of the eleven MVP awards in the eleven-year period between 1958 and 1969; played against one another in six Eastern Conference Finals and two NBA Finals between 1959 and 1969. Many of the records set by these two players have endured today. Most notably, Chamberlain and Russell hold the top eighteen season averages for rebounds.

Bill Russell led the University of San Francisco to two consecutive NCAA championships (1955, 56). He joined the Boston Celtics and helped make them one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history, winning eleven championships over his thirteen-year career (1956–69) as well as five MVP awards. Russell revolutionized defensive strategy with his shot-blocking, rebounding and physical man-to-man defense. While he was never the focal point of the Celtics offense, much of the team&#x27;s scoring came when Russell grabbed defensive rebounds and initiated fast breaks with precision outlet passes, primarily to point guard Bob Cousy. As the NBA&#x27;s first African-American superstar, Russell struggled throughout his career with the racism he encountered from fans in Boston, particularly after the 1966–67 season, when he became the first African-American in any major sport to be named player-coach.

His principal rival Wilt Chamberlain, listed at 7&#x27;1&quot; (2.15 m), 275 pounds (124 kg), lacked Russell&#x27;s supporting cast. Chamberlain played college ball for the Kansas Jayhawks, leading them to the 1957 title game against the North Carolina Tar Heels. Although the Jayhawks lost by one point in triple overtime, Chamberlain was named the tournament&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player. Briefly a member of the Harlem Globetrotters before joining the Philadelphia Warriors of the NBA in 1959, Chamberlain won two championships, in 1967 with the Philadelphia 76ers and 1972 with the Los Angeles Lakers, although his teams were repeatedly defeated by the Celtics in the Eastern Conference and NBA Finals, including two NBA Finals loss to Willis Reed&#x27;s New York Knicks in 1970 and 1973. He also won seven scoring titles, eleven rebounding titles, and four regular season Most Valuable Player awards, including the distinction, in 1960, of being the first rookie to receive the award. Stronger than any player of his era, he was usually capable of scoring and rebounding at will. Although he was the target of constant double- and triple-teaming, as well as fouling tactics designed to take advantage of his poor free-throw shooting, he set a number of records that have never been broken. Most notably, Chamberlain is the only player in NBA history to average more than 50 points in a season and score 100 points in a single game (both in 1961–62 as a member of the Philadelphia Warriors). He also holds the NBA&#x27;s all-time records for rebounding average (27.2), rebounds in a single game (55), and career rebounds (23,924). While Chamberlain excelled in scoring and rebounding, he was also an adept passer for a big man. During his tenure with the 76ers, Chamberlain averaged around 7 assists per game, even leading the league in total assists in the 1967–68 season with 702.

A lesser-known center of the era was Nate Thurmond, who initially played the forward position opposite Chamberlain for the San Francisco Warriors but moved to center after Chamberlain was traded to the new Philadelphia franchise. Although he never won a Championship, Thurmond was known as the best screen setter in the league, and his averages of 21.3 and 22.0 rebounds per game in 1966–67 and 1967–68, are exceeded only by Chamberlain and Russell.

=== 1970s–1980s: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era ===

In contrast to the Celtics dynasty of the 1960s, the 1970s were a decade of parity in the NBA, with eight different champions and no back-to-back winners. At the college level, the UCLA Bruins, under Coach John Wooden, built the greatest dynasty in NCAA basketball history, winning seven consecutive titles between 1967 and 1973. UCLA had already won two consecutive titles in 1964 and 1965 with teams that pressed and emphasized guard play. After not winning in 1966, Wooden&#x27;s teams changed their style when Lew Alcindor became eligible. He led UCLA to three championships-in 1967, &#x27;68 and &#x27;69-while winning the first Naismith College Player of the Year Award. During his college career, the NCAA enacted a ban on dunking primarily because of Alcindor&#x27;s dominant use of the shot. His entrance into the NBA with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1969 was timely, as Bill Russell had just retired and Wilt Chamberlain was 33 years old and increasingly plagued by injuries. After leading the Bucks to the 1971 NBA championship, teamed up with legendary point guard Oscar Robertson, Alcindor, who had converted to Islam, changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In 1975, Abdul-Jabbar was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, and, after the arrival of point guard Magic Johnson in 1980, formed part of a new Lakers dynasty that won five NBA titles (1980, &#x27;82, &#x27;85, &#x27;87, &#x27;88). In addition, Abdul-Jabbar won six regular-season MVP awards (1971, &#x27;72, &#x27;74, &#x27;76, &#x27;77, &#x27;80). At 7&#x27;2&quot; (2.18 m), 235 pounds (106 kg), he lacked the strength of Chamberlain in his prime, but had a longer wingspan and ultimately proved more durable, adhering to a strict physical-fitness regime that enabled him to play for twenty years, the longest career in NBA history at the time. Offensively, he was best known for his trademark &#x27;Skyhook&#x27; hook-shot, almost impossible to block because of his height and wingspan. His regular season career scoring total of 38,387 points was an NBA record for nearly 39 years. Defensively, the 1973–74 season was the first in which the number of blocked shots were kept, and, over the next seven years, Kareem led the league in this statistic or finished second.

Another product of John Wooden&#x27;s UCLA program, Bill Walton, appeared poised to join the ranks of great centers. He led UCLA to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, he also led the Portland Trail Blazers to the NBA championship in 1977, and won the NBA MVP the following year. However, his career was plagued with injuries, most infamously a broken bone in his left foot suffered during his MVP season that he never fully recovered from, and he spent most of the following decade on the bench, although he eventually did win a second NBA title as a backup for the Boston Celtics in 1986, when he received the Sixth Man Award. Willis Reed won two championships with the New York Knicks in 1970 and 1973, teamed with point guard Walt Frazier; although undersized for the center position at 6&#x27;9&quot;, he had the strength to play inside, was a highly skilled jump shooter and was effective at setting picks, a key element in the Knicks motion-oriented offense. The undersized but scrappy Dave Cowens, drafted at the recommendation of Bill Russell, helped the Boston Celtics win two more NBA titles, in 1974 and 1976.

Leading centers of the late 1970s and early 1980s include Wes Unseld of the Baltimore/Washington Bullets, Artis Gilmore of the ABA Kentucky Colonels, Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs; Moses Malone of the Houston Rockets and Philadelphia 76ers; and Robert Parish of the Boston Celtics, who was acquired from the Golden State Warriors in 1980 for the top overall pick in the NBA Draft. Unseld led the Bullets to four NBA finals appearances and one championship, in 1978. Using his strength and determination to compensate for his lack of size (6&#x27;7&quot;, i.e. 2.00 m), he was famous for his rebounding, shotblocking, and bone-jarring picks. Artis Gilmore, often overlooked because of the mediocrity of his teams, established himself as the best low-post scorer in the league. He set the NCAA Division I record for career average in rebounds (25.2) at tiny Jacksonville University, and enjoyed an illustrious ABA career before joining the NBA&#x27;s Chicago Bulls in 1976, playing there until he was traded to San Antonio in 1982, for whom he played until his retirement in 1987. He remains the NBA&#x27;s career leader in field goal percentage (minimum 2000 shots made) with a 59.9 percentage. Malone, the first high school player to turn professional, was drafted by the Houston Rockets after several years in the ABA, and won two MVP Awards and led Houston to its first NBA Finals in 1981, before joining the Philadelphia 76ers, where, teamed with Julius Erving and Bobby Jones, he won an NBA Championship in 1983, as well as a third League MVP. Never a dominant defender, his quickness and tenacity made him one of the best rebounders in NBA history, particularly on the offensive end; he led the league in rebounds six times in a seven-year period and still holds the NBA record for offensive rebounds.

In the mid-1980s, the 7&#x27;4&quot; (2.23 m) Mark Eaton was the most prolific shot-blocker in the league, and, although never a major offensive contributor, won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards while helping transform the lowly Utah Jazz into a playoff contender. Of all these players, none enjoyed the success of Robert Parish, who, with forwards Larry Bird and Kevin McHale, formed the legendary frontcourt of the Boston Celtics team that won three titles (1981, 1984 and 1986). The Celtics&#x27; fierce rivalry with the Lakers dominated the NBA during the decade and helped basketball reach an unprecedented level of popularity. Nicknamed &quot;Chief&quot; after a character in the film &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; because of his stoic demeanor, Parish was known for his trademark arching jump-shot—leading many experts to consider him the best medium-range shooting center of all time—and his ability to finish fast-breaks with his surprising speed. Playing until the age of 43, Parish broke Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s record for career games played.

The 1979–80 season saw the introduction of the three-point shot. While the concept of the &#x27;stretch five&#x27; would not come until the new millennium, players such as Bill Laimbeer and Jack Sikma developed a reliable outside shot later in their career, hitting around the 30% mark.

=== 1990s: Hakeem Olajuwon–David Robinson–Shaquille O&#x27;Neal era ===

Coach John Thompson, once a seldom-used backup to Bill Russell with the Celtics, developed the Georgetown Hoyas into a chief pipeline for talent at the Center position, producing a succession of great defensive big men in Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo Mourning. In 1984, Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, defeated the University of Houston, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, to win the NCAA championship. The number one picks in the 1984, 1985, and 1987 NBA Drafts would all be used on centers who made major impacts in the NBA of the 1990s and eventually became members of the Basketball Hall of Fame: Olajuwon in 1984, Ewing in 1985, and Navy&#x27;s David Robinson in 1987.

The Nigerian-born Olajuwon was drafted by the Houston Rockets and paired with power forward Ralph Sampson in what was dubbed the &#x27;Twin Towers&#x27; duo. In his second season, 1985–86, the Rockets upset the Lakers in the Western Conference finals. Olajuwon established himself as a dominant player, leading the Rockets to two consecutive NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. In the 1993–94 season he became the only player in NBA history to win the NBA&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP), Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP awards in the same season. Defensively Olajuwon broke Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s career record for blocked shots. Offensively, he was best known for his &#x27;Dream Shake&#x27;, a series of fakes and spin moves regarded as the pinnacle of big man footwork.

Ewing, from Jamaica by way of the Boston area, was drafted by the New York Knicks in 1985, with whom he spent fifteen of his seventeen seasons in the NBA. An eleven-time All Star, Ewing was one of the best shooting centers in NBA history, possessing a baseline jump-shot, as well as being a formidable shot blocker and rebounder. The Knicks were formidable opponents of the Chicago Bulls dynasty in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Ewing&#x27;s successor as the starting center at Georgetown, Dikembe Mutombo, who played most of his NBA career with the Denver Nuggets and Atlanta Hawks proved a dominant defender. Mutombo, who had not played basketball before arriving in the U.S. from his native Zaire on a USAID scholarship, was among the greatest shot blockers in NBA history, leading the NBA in blocked-shots five consecutive years, in the course of a career in which he ranked second in the history of the league in blocked shots, behind only Hakeem Olajuwon. He was also the recipient of four NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards, tied for the record with Ben Wallace.

Robinson, drafted by the San Antonio Spurs in 1987, did not enter the NBA for two years due to his commitment with the United States Naval Academy. Upon his arrival in 1989, Robinson instantly transformed the Spurs into title contenders, eventually becoming a ten-time All-Star, MVP and Defensive Player of the Year. Leaner but more muscular than most centers, Robinson outran opponents with his speed and agility, while possessing a reliable left-handed jumper.

The 1992 NBA draft marked the entrance into the league of Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, who was drafted by the Orlando Magic. Immediately drawing comparisons to Wilt Chamberlain, the 7&#x27;1&quot; (2.15 m), 325-pound (147 kg) O&#x27;Neal was billed as potentially the most physically dominating player ever. By his third season, he led the league in scoring and led the Magic to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the Houston Rockets. After the 1995–96 season, he signed with the rebuilding Los Angeles Lakers. Former Georgetown center Alonzo Mourning, also drafted in 1992, established himself as a premier big man with the Charlotte Hornets and, later, the Miami Heat, winning two Defensive Player of the Year Awards thanks to his prolific shot blocking while also proving a reliable scoring threat.

===2000s: Changing times===

The NBA landscape began to change in the 1990s as more international players entered the league. Yugoslavia&#x27;s Vlade Divac and Lithuania&#x27;s Arvydas Sabonis arrived in 1989 and 1995 respectively, and brought in a new play style. Unlike traditional post-up centers, Divac and Sabonis focused more on playmaking and perimeter shooting, hallmarks of the European style of play.

The balance of power shifted to the Western Conference, and the NBA was dominated by the Los Angeles Lakers, who won titles in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, and 2010, and the San Antonio Spurs, who won in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014. Even as traditional centers such as Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and later on Yao Ming and Dwight Howard continued to dominate the game, the importance of a center was starting to change.

In the 1990s, an increasing number of smaller forwards, most notably Dennis Rodman and Charles Barkley, excelled at the traditional center functions of rebounding, shot-blocking and low-post defense, anticipating a trend towards relying on shorter and quicker post players that continued into the 2000s, as exemplified by perennial Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace. In the fast break oriented style of offense employed by a growing number of teams, the traditional role of the center is diminished, if not done away with altogether. Many talented big men choose to play the more versatile power forward position, giving them more room to run the floor and play outside the paint. Under the influence of European basketball, the offensive role of big men has been redefined to include more emphasis on perimeter play, as exemplified by 3-point shooting big men like Dirk Nowitzki, Mehmet Okur, Andrea Bargnani, and Channing Frye.

Most importantly, winning an NBA championship no longer required a dominant center, unlike in previous years. Perimeter players such as Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry became the faces of modern championship teams, and in those instances, their centers were more of a complementary piece than a cornerstone.

===2010s–present: Rise of stretch five and playmaking centers===
The low-post functions of the center position continued to dwindle in the 2010s as the NBA embraced small ball and a more perimeter-oriented style of play. While there are still a few centers that play a more traditional style, some centers begin to adapt to the outside game.
The Miami Heat, for example, featured a &quot;positionless&quot; lineup as coined by head coach Erik Spoelstra, with power forwards Chris Bosh and Udonis Haslem shifting between center and power forward depending on matchups. The Heat won two NBA championships in and using this unconventional lineup.

The Golden State Warriors then won three championships in , , and with a smaller and quicker group known as the Death Lineup. In this case, 6&#x27;7&quot; forward Draymond Green was often slotted into the center position, creating matchup problems for larger centers with his defensive versatility, speed, ball-handling skills, and perimeter shooting.

The rise of the stretch five paved the way for centers to add outside shooting to their arsenal. While they continue to roam the paint at times, they have also expanded their game to the perimeter with their three-point shots. Notable modern stretch fives include Al Horford, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, Brook Lopez, Marc Gasol, and Kristaps Porziņģis.

Another byproduct of the small ball revolution is the emergence of big men who possess guard-like skills. An example is Nikola Jokić, whose passing ability for a player his size made the Denver Nuggets contenders in the late 2010s and early 2020s, winning their first ever NBA Championship in 2023. Victor Wembanyama, at 7&#x27;4&quot;, also emerged as a highly-touted prospect by dominating the French professional leagues, before getting drafted by the San Antonio Spurs as the first pick of the 2023 NBA draft.

Before 2021, the most recent center to win the NBA MVP award was Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in 2000. Since then the last four MVP winners have been centers, with Jokić winning three awards in 2021, 2022 and 2024, and Embiid in 2023.

==In women&#x27;s basketball==
In women&#x27;s basketball, 7&#x27;0&quot; (2.13 m) Uljana Semjonova played the center position, helping the Soviet Union women&#x27;s team win two Olympic gold medals, in 1976 and 1980, and never losing a game in international competition. Semjonova also led her club team, TTT Riga to fifteen European Champion&#x27;s Cup titles. The 6&#x27;8&quot; (2.03 m) Anne Donovan led the Old Dominion University Lady Monarchs to the 1979 Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women championship, and was the first female Naismith College Player of the Year recipient in 1983, before enjoying a successful professional career in Japan and Italy.

With the formation of the WNBA, Lisa Leslie established herself as the premier center, and the league&#x27;s most popular player. The first WNBA player to reach the 3,000 point milestone, she led the Los Angeles Sparks to consecutive titles in 2001 and 2002, and holds the distinction of being the first player to dunk in a WNBA game. Other prominent centers in women&#x27;s basketball include Australian Lauren Jackson of the Seattle Storm and Karl Malone&#x27;s daughter Cheryl Ford of the Detroit Shock. Jackson can also be considered a forward-center because she is also a very good outside shooter, leading the WNBA in three-point shooting percentage in one season. Rebecca Lobo led the Connecticut Huskies to an NCAA Championship in 1995, but never recovered from a torn ACL and had a disappointing professional career. When at the University of Oklahoma, Courtney Paris was considered the next dominant female center after becoming the only NCAA player, male or female, to score 700 points, grab 500 rebounds and block 100 shots in a single season; however, she had a disappointing WNBA career and was waived before what would have been the start of her second season in 2010. The tallest center in the WNBA, the late Margo Dydek of Poland, who stood 7&#x27;2&quot;, is still the league&#x27;s career leader in blocks per game (2.72) and total blocks (877), solidly ahead of Leslie in that category despite Dydek playing 40 fewer games before her retirement.

<text>Cape Point () is a promontory at the southeast corner of the Cape Peninsula, a mountainous and scenic landform that runs north-south for about thirty kilometres at the extreme southwestern tip of the African continent in South Africa. Table Mountain and the city of Cape Town are close to the northern extremity of the same peninsula. The cape is located at , about 2.3 kilometres (1.4 mi) east and a little north of the Cape of Good Hope on the southwest corner. Although these two rocky capes are very well known, neither cape is actually the southernmost point of the mainland of Africa; that is Cape Agulhas, approximately to the east-southeast.

==Peaks==
The peak above Cape Point is higher than that above the Cape of Good Hope. The rugged sandstone (Table Mountain sandstone) ridge that rises from Cape Point at sea level develops into two peaks. There is a major peak that dominates the skyline locally, but there is also a smaller peak about 100 m (328 ft) further south. The higher peak has the old lighthouse on the top. The Flying Dutchman Funicular runs from a car park to the north up to slightly below the level of the old lighthouse, and a short flight of steps leads to a viewing platform around the base of the lighthouse. From the end of the railway, a second path leads to a lower peak.

==Lighthouse==

The new lighthouse is at a lower elevation (87 meters; 285.5 feet above sea level), for two reasons: the old lighthouse, located at (262 meters; 859.6 feet above sea level), could be seen &#x27;too early&#x27; by ships rounding the point towards the east, causing them to approach too closely. Secondly, foggy conditions often prevail at the higher levels, making the older lighthouse invisible to shipping. On 18 April 1911, the Portuguese liner &quot;Lusitania&quot; was wrecked just south of Cape Point at on Bellows Rock for precisely this reason, prompting the relocation of the lighthouse.

The new lighthouse, located at , cannot be seen from the West until ships are at a safe distance to the South. The light of the new Cape Point lighthouse is the most powerful on the South African coast, with a range of and an intensity of 10 megacandelas in each flash.

==Table Mountain National Park==
Cape Point is situated within the Table Mountain National Park, within a section of the park referred to as Cape of Good Hope. This section covers the whole of the southern tip of the Cape Peninsula and which takes in perhaps 20% of its total area. The Cape of Good Hope section of the park is generally wild, unspoiled and undeveloped and is an important haven for seabirds. The vegetation at Cape Point consists primarily of Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos.

==Ocean currents==

Cape Point is often mistakenly claimed to be the place where the cold Benguela Current of the Atlantic Ocean and the warm Agulhas Current of the Indian Ocean collide. In fact, the meeting point fluctuates along the southern and southwestern Cape coast, usually occurring between Cape Agulhas and Cape Point. The two intermingling currents help to create the micro-climate of Cape Town and its environs. Contrary to popular mythology, the meeting point of the currents produces no obvious visual effect; there is no &quot;line in the ocean&quot; where the sea changes colour or looks different in some way. There are, however, strong and dangerous swells, tides and localized currents around the point and in adjacent waters. These troubled seas have witnessed countless maritime disasters in the centuries since ships first sailed here.

Fishing is good along the coast but the unpredictable swells make angling from the rocks very dangerous. Over the years scores of fishermen have been swept to their deaths from the rocky platforms by freak waves. False Bay, which opens to the east and north of Cape Point, is the location of the well-known naval port of Simon&#x27;s Town. The bay is also famous – or infamous – for its great white sharks, which hunt the Cape fur seals that live in the area.

==Climate research==
Cape Point is the site of one of the Global Atmosphere Watch&#x27;s atmospheric research stations. In the early years of the 20th century icebergs from Antarctica were occasionally sighted from Cape Point. There have been no authentic recent sightings of ice, which some climatologists and experts have attributed to global warming.

<text>Cornelius Nepos (; c. 110 BC – c. 25 BC) was a Roman biographer. He was born at Hostilia, a village in Cisalpine Gaul not far from Verona.

==Biography==
Nepos&#x27;s Cisalpine birth is attested by Ausonius, and Pliny the Elder calls him &quot;Padi accola&quot; (&quot;a dweller on the River Po&quot;, &quot;Naturalis historia&quot; III.127). He was a friend of Catullus, who dedicates his poems to him (I.3), Cicero and Titus Pomponius Atticus. Eusebius places him in the fourth year of the reign of Augustus, which is supposed to be when he began to attract critical acclaim by his writing. Pliny the Elder notes he died in the reign of Augustus (&quot;Natural History&quot; IX.39, X.23).

==Works==
===&quot;De viris illustribus&quot;===

Nepos&#x27;s &quot;De viris illustribus&quot; consisted of parallel lives of distinguished Romans and foreigners, in sixteen books. It originally included &quot;descriptions of foreign and Roman kings, generals, lawyers, orators, poets, historians, and philosophers&quot;. However, the sole surviving book (which is thought to be complete) is the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Lives of the Eminent Commanders&quot;), which covers commanders and generals (&quot;imperatores&quot;); its contents are as follows:

* Miltiades
* Themistocles
* Aristides
* Pausanias
* Cimon
* Lysander
* Alcibiades
* Thrasybulus
* Conon
* Dion
* Iphicrates
* Chabrias
* Timotheus
* Datames
* Epaminondas
* Pelopidas
* Agesilaus
* Eumenes
* Phocion
* Timoleon
* On Kings
* Hamilcar
* Hannibal

Two additional lives survive from elsewhere in the &quot;De viris illustribus&quot;:

* Cato
* Atticus

The &quot;Excellentium imperatorum vitae&quot; appeared in the reign of Theodosius I, as the work of the grammarian Aemilius Probus, who presented it to the emperor with a dedication in Latin verse. He claims it to have been the work of his mother or father (the manuscripts vary) and his grandfather. Despite the obvious questions (such as why the preface addressed to someone named Atticus when the work was supposedly dedicated to Theodosius), no one seemed to have doubted Probus&#x27;s authorship. Eventually Peter Cornerus discovered in a manuscript of Cicero&#x27;s letters the biographies of Cato and Atticus. He added them to the other existing biographies, despite the fact that the writer speaks of himself as a contemporary and friend of Atticus, and that the manuscript bore the heading &quot;E libro posteriore Cornelii Nepotis&quot; (&#x27;from the last book of Cornelius Nepos&#x27;). At last Dionysius Lambinus&#x27;s edition of 1569 bore a commentary demonstrating on stylistic grounds that the work must have been of Nepos alone, and not Aemilius Probus. This view has been tempered by more recent scholarship, which agrees with Lambinus that they are the work of Nepos, but that Probus probably abridged the biographies when he added the verse dedication. The &quot;Life of Atticus&quot;, however, is considered to be the exclusive composition of Nepos.

===Other works===

Nearly all of Nepos&#x27;s other writings are lost, but several allusions to them survive in works by other authors. Aulus Gellius&#x27;s &quot;Attic Nights&quot; are of special importance in this respect.

* &quot;Chronica&quot;, an epitome of universal history; Catullus seems to allude to the &quot;Chronica&quot; in his dedication to Nepos. Ausonius also mentions it in his sixteenth Epistle to Probus, as does Aulus Gellius in the &quot;Noctes Atticae&quot; (XVII.21). &quot;Probably a chronological summary which included the history of outside nations as well as of Rome,&quot; it is thought to have been written in three books.
* &quot;Exempla&quot;, a collection of anecdotes after the style of Valerius Maximus; &quot;Exemplorum libri&quot;, of which Charisius cites the second book, and Aulus Gellius the fifth (VI.18, 19). The book likely contained &quot;models for imitation, drawn from the early Romans, whose simplicity contrasted with the luxury&quot; of Nepos&#x27;s era.&quot;
* letters to Cicero; &quot;De Vita Ciceronis&quot;. Aulus Gellius corrects an error in this work (XV.28). The book is thought to have been written after the death of the consul, statesman and orator Cicero. According to Roberts, &quot;his friendship for Cicero and Atticus and his access to their correspondence would have made the work an especially valuable one for us.&quot;
* lives of Cato the elder; A complete biography of Cato the Censor, from which Aulus Gellius draws an anecdote of Cato (XI.8).
* &quot;Epistulae ad Ciceronem&quot;, an extract of which survives in Lactantius (&quot;Divinarum Institutionum Libri Septem&quot; III.15). It is unclear whether they were ever formally published.

Pliny the Younger mentions verse written by Nepos, and in his own &quot;Life of Dion&quot;, Nepos himself refers to a work of his own authorship, &quot;De Historicis&quot;. If a separate work, this would be from a hypothesized &quot;De Historicis Latinis&quot;, only one book in the larger &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot; (see above), although exclusively comprising biographies of Romans. Pliny also mentions a longer &quot;Life of Cato&quot; at the end of the extant &quot;Life of Cato&quot;, written at the request of Titus Pomponius Atticus, the &quot;complete biography&quot; now lost.

==In popular culture==

While the historical Cornelius Nepos does not appear in fiction, his name is used by the German Romantic author Achim von Arnim for one of the characters in his novella &quot;&quot;. Contrary to the historical Cornelius, who has been thought of as a writer of simple, less elegant prose, as evidenced through his writing, this Cornelius is a Mandrake, a root creature created from a hangman&#x27;s tears, and dug up on a dark night at 11 at night, who is a treasure finder, desiring to become more important than what he is. Desiring to be a Field Marshal in the Holy Roman Empire, Cornelius serves the title character, Isabella, helping her by digging up treasures for them, while rejecting the very notion of being considered a Mandrake in society.

An analogy to historical contexts, Arnim names the mandrake Cornelius Nepos, in an effort to implement what Tzvetan Todorov calls &quot;the fantastic&quot;, a genre that sets what is real against what is imaginary or supernatural; to transmit to society that life is not as simple as we make it out to be. Here, Nepos is used to convey that idea, that when the real Nepos is set against that of the supernatural mandrake, the reader and society at large, cannot be certain as to which is the real and which is the imaginary, a microcosm of the &quot;uneasy conscience of the nineteenth century.&quot;

<text>Israel Tal (, 13 September 1924 – 8 September 2010), also known as Talik (Hebrew: טליק), was an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) general known for his knowledge of tank warfare and for leading the development of Israel&#x27;s Merkava tank.

==Biography==
Tal was born in Mahanayim, Mandatory Palestine. On his mother&#x27;s side he was descended from Hasidic Jews who migrated to Safed and Tiberias in 1777. He lived in Safed from the age of five and lived through the 1929 Palestine riots. Later he lived in moshav Be&#x27;er Tuvia.

Tal began his military service at the age of 17, with the British Army&#x27;s Jewish Brigade, serving as a machine gunner in North Africa and Italy during the Second World War. After the Jewish Brigade was disbanded in 1946, he enlisted in the Haganah. He served as a junior infantry officer during the 1947–1949 Palestine war, as a brigade commander during the 1956 Sinai War, an armored-division commander in Sinai Peninsula during the Six-Day War, and commander of the southern front during the final stages of the Yom Kippur War.

Israel Tal died in Rehovot on 8 September 2010.

==Military career==

Tal, who had been a hero of the Six-Day War, was an early opponent of the Bar Lev Line. He and General Ariel Sharon argued that it would not succeed in fending off Egyptian forces. After the official end of the Yom Kippur War, Tal, serving as commander of the southern front, received an order from Chief of Staff General David Elazar and Defense Minister Moshe Dayan to attack Egyptian forces. Tal refused to follow the order, insisting that it was an unethical order and requesting authorization for the requested attack from the Prime Minister and the Supreme Court. Such authorization never came. Tal won the argument, but his refusal to follow the order as a practical matter eliminated his chance of being nominated for the position of Chief of Staff to succeed General Elazar.

In 1970, the Israeli government decided it needed an independent tank-building capability due to the uncertainty of overseas sales for political reasons. Tal led a development team that took into consideration Israel&#x27;s battlefield characteristics and lessons learned from previous wars, and began the development and building of Israel&#x27;s Merkava tank.

==Armor doctrine==
Tal was the creator of the Israeli armored doctrine that led to the Israeli successes in the Sinai surprise attack of the Six-Day War. In 1964, General Tal took over the Israeli armored corps and organized it into the leading element of the Israeli Defense Forces, characterized by high mobility and relentless assault. He re-trained all Israeli gunners to hit targets beyond . In open terrain, such long-distance gunnery proved vital to the survival of the Israeli armored corps in subsequent wars. Israel&#x27;s Arab opponents, especially Egypt and Syria, normally fired their Soviet-made tank guns from a distance of between , and quite often tank units advanced to within of their targets before firing their main guns. This gave the Israelis an opportunity to exploit this weakness in Arab military doctrine. Its mobility is considered comparable to the German Blitzkrieg and many hold it to be an evolution of that tactic. Tal&#x27;s transformation and success in 1967 led the IDF to expand the role of armor. However, this resulted in reduced attention to other less glamorous, but essential aspects of the army, such as the infantry. Following the 1973 surprise attack, this excessive focus on fast-striking offensive armor left the IDF temporarily without adequate defensive capability. Only in the latter stages of the war (with the aid of a US$1.1 billion airlift, Operation Nickel Grass) did the armor break out and show its potential; General Avraham Adan&#x27;s armor broke through the Egyptian lines, crossed the Suez Canal and enveloped the Egyptian 3rd Army near Suez. While the IDF has become a more balanced force since 1973, Tal&#x27;s development of armored doctrine has been very important to the IDF and has influenced armored doctrines in other parts of the world.

==Awards and honours==

Israel Tal was awarded the Eliyahu Golomb Israel Security Award in 1961 and 1973. In 1997, Tal was awarded the Israel Prize for his special contribution to the society and State of Israel.

In 1991, he received an honorary doctorate at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. In 2002, he was chosen &quot;Knight of Quality Government&quot; by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel in the &quot;Military and Security&quot; category. Israel Tal&#x27;s picture appears in the Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor&#x27;s &quot;Wall of Greatest Armor Commanders&quot; along with compatriot Moshe Peled, Americans George S. Patton and Creighton Abrams and German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.

<doc id="652583" wikidata="Q877353" url="?curid=652583" title="Indirect election">
<text>An indirect election or &quot;hierarchical voting,&quot; is an election in which voters do not choose directly among candidates or parties for an office (direct voting system), but elect people who in turn choose candidates or parties. It is one of the oldest forms of elections and is used by many countries for heads of state (such as presidents), cabinets, heads of government (such as prime ministers), and/or upper houses. It is also used for some supranational legislatures.

Positions that are indirectly elected may be chosen by a permanent body (such as a parliament) or by a special body convened solely for that purpose (such as an electoral college).

In nearly all cases the body that controls the federal executive branch (such as a cabinet) is elected indirectly. This includes the cabinets of most parliamentary systems; members of the public elect the parliamentarians, who then elect the cabinet. Upper houses, especially in federal republics, are often indirectly elected, either by the corresponding lower house or cabinet. An election can be partially indirect, for example in the case of indirect single transferable voting, where only eliminated candidates select other candidates to transfer their vote share to. Similarly, supranational legislatures can be indirectly elected by constituent countries&#x27; legislatures or executive governments.

== Heads of state ==
A head of state is the official leader and representative of a country. The head of state position can vary from ceremonial figurehead with limited power to powerful leader depending on the government structure and historical legacy of the country. For instance, in some cases heads of state inherit the position through a monarchy whereas others are indirectly or directly elected such as presidents. Several examples are included below.

=== United States ===
The President of the United States is elected indirectly. In a US presidential election, eligible members of the public vote for the electors of an Electoral College, who have previously pledged publicly to support a particular presidential candidate. When the Electoral College sits, soon after the election, it formally elects the candidate that has won a majority of the members of the Electoral College. Members of the federal cabinet, including the vice president, are in practice nominated by the president, and are thus elected indirectly. The Electoral College is a controversial issue in U.S. politics, especially following presidential elections when voting is polarized geographically in such a way that the electoral college elects a candidate who did not win an absolute majority of the popular vote. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, if enacted, would effectively replace the indirect election via the Electoral College with a &quot;de facto&quot; plurality-based direct election.

=== China ===
The Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China specifies a system of indirect democracy. The National People&#x27;s Congress elects the president, also known as the state chairman, who serves as head of state. The power of the presidency is largely ceremonial, the vast majority of power stems from the president&#x27;s position as leader of the Communist Party and head of the military.

=== European Union ===
The president of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council and confirmed or denied by the directly elected European Parliament (see Elections to the European Parliament).

=== Parliamentary systems ===
Republics with parliamentary systems usually elect their head of state indirectly (e.g. Germany, Italy, Estonia, Latvia, Malta, Hungary, India, Israel, Bangladesh). Several parliamentary republics, such as Ireland, Austria, Croatia, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, operate using a semi-presidential system with a directly elected president distinct from the prime minister.

== Government ==
A head of government is in charge of the daily business of government and overseeing central government institutions. In presidential systems the president is the head of government and head of state. In parliamentary systems the head of government is usually the leader of the party with the most seats in the legislature. Several examples of heads of government who are chosen through indirect elections are summarized below.

=== Prime minister ===
The most prominent position in parliamentary democracies is the prime ministership.

Under the Westminster system, named after and typified by the parliament of the United Kingdom, a prime minister (or first minister, premier, or chief minister) is the person that can command the largest coalition of supporters in parliament. In almost all cases, the prime minister is the leader of a political party (or coalition) that has a majority in the parliament, or the lower house (such as the House of Commons), or in the situation that no one party has a majority then the largest party or a coalition of smaller parties may attempt to form a minority government. The prime minister is thus indirectly elected as political parties elect their own leader through internal democratic process, while the general public choose from amongst the local candidates of the various political parties or independents.

The Westminster model continues to be used in a number of Commonwealth countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Additionally many nations colonized by the British Empire inherited the Westminster model following their independence.

In Spain, the Congress of Deputies votes on a motion of confidence of the king&#x27;s nominee (customarily the party leader whose party controls the Congress) and the nominee&#x27;s political manifesto, an example of an indirect election of the prime minister of Spain.

=== Federal Chancellor ===
In Germany, the federal chancellor - the most powerful position on the federal level - is elected indirectly by the Bundestag, which in turn is elected by the population. The federal president, the head of state, proposes candidates for the chancellor&#x27;s office. Although this has never happened, the Bundestag may in theory also choose to elect another person into office, which the president has to accept.

=== Appointment ===
Some countries have nonpartisan heads of government who are appointed by the president, such as the Prime Minister of Singapore.

== Upper houses ==
Members of the German Bundesrat are appointed (delegated) by the &quot;Landtag&quot; of the various states.

In France, election to the upper house of Parliament, the , is indirect. Electors (called &quot;Grands électeurs&quot;) are locally elected representatives.

Members of the Indian Rajya Sabha (upper house of parliament) are largely elected directly by the Vidhan Sabha (legislative assembly) of the various states and Union territories; some are appointed by the president.

Indirect single transferable voting is used to elect some members of the Senate of Pakistan.

==Legislatures==

===China===
The National People&#x27;s Congress of China is elected by lower level of the system of people&#x27;s congress.

===Supranational===
Some examples of indirectly elected supranational legislatures include: the parliamentary assemblies of the Council of Europe, OSCE and NATO – in all of these cases, voters elect national parliamentarians, who in turn elect some of their own members to the assembly. The same applies to bodies formed by representatives chosen by a national government, e.g. the United Nations General Assembly – assuming the national governments in question are democratically elected in the first place.

==Historical==
The Control Yuan of China, formerly a parliamentary chamber, was elected by its respective legislatures across the country: five from each province, two from each directly administered municipality, eight from Mongolia (by 1948 only the Inner Mongolian provinces were represented), eight from Tibet and eight from the overseas Chinese communities. As originally envisioned both the President and Vice President of the Control Yuan were to be elected by and from the members like the speaker of many other parliamentary bodies worldwide. The Control Yuan became a sole auditory body in Taiwan in 1993 after democratization.

Members of the United States Senate were elected by the Legislature of the various states until ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913. Since that time they have been elected by direct popular vote.

==Accountability==
Indirect elections can have a lower political accountability and responsiveness compared to direct elections.

<text>Miriam, Lady Hogg ( Stern; formerly Stoppard; born 12 May 1937), known professionally by her former married name Miriam Stoppard, is an English medical doctor, journalist, author and television presenter.

== Early life and medical career ==
Miriam Stern was born in Newcastle upon Tyne. Her father, Sidney, was a nurse and her mother, Jenny, worked for the Newcastle school dinners service. Her sister is social justice activist Murreil Hazel Stern. Her family was Orthodox Jewish. Her father was born Jewish and her mother converted to Judaism.

Stern grew up on a council housing estate. Her mother was a dressmaker who taught Miriam how to make her own clothing, and from an early age she bought remnants of cloth with her pocket-money. Up until her teens, she fashioned her own designs, complemented with cheap and improvised accessories.

As a teenager she attended school on a scholarship. Inspired by her father, she had early aspirations to become a doctor. Outside of studies she enjoyed music, danced and played table tennis. Stern attended the Central High School in Eskdale Terrace and trained as a nurse at the Newcastle General Hospital (Royal Free Medical School). She went on to study medicine at King&#x27;s College, Durham (which became Newcastle University in 1963).

== Career ==
After qualifying as a doctor, Stoppard worked at the Newcastle&#x27;s Royal Victoria Infirmary and specialised in dermatology as a senior registrar at Bristol Royal Infirmary. She became a research director and then managing director in the pharmaceutical industry for Syntex. She became well known during the 1970s and 1980s as a television presenter on scientific and medical programmes such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me&quot; and &quot;Where There&#x27;s Life&quot;.

Stoppard has written several books about health, including the &quot;Children&#x27;s Medical Handbook&quot;, but particularly on the subject of women&#x27;s health. She writes on health issues and acts as an agony aunt for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, having previously answered readers&#x27; letters for &quot;TV Times&quot; magazine. Her company, Miriam Stoppard Lifetime, sells her books and health products.

Stoppard was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to healthcare and charity.

In August 2012, writing in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Stoppard supported UCL&#x27;s Institute of Child Health research which suggested reviewing the recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding until six months, adding that the appearance of teeth should signal the end of breastfeeding. She was named Journalist of the Year at the Stonewall Awards on 6 November of that year.

== Family ==
From 1972 to 1992 Stoppard was married to the playwright Tom Stoppard, with whom she had two sons. One of their sons is the actor Ed Stoppard. She married the industrialist Sir Christopher Hogg in 1997, and was married to him until his death in 2021. She has two stepdaughters from her second husband&#x27;s first marriage.

Former MP Oona King is Stoppard&#x27;s niece; she is the daughter of Preston King and Miriam&#x27;s sister, Murreil Hazel Stern. Her first cousin is politician Ted Graham, Baron Graham of Edmonton.
