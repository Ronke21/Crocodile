<text>Nervión (; ) is a river that runs through the town of Bilbao, Spain into the Cantabrian Sea (Bay of Biscay). Its lowermost course, downstream of its confluence with the Ibaizabal River, is known as the Estuary of Bilbao.

==Geography==
The river is long from its source at the Burgos and Alava provincial limits to the sea and runs in a South to North direction. Soon after its source, the river forms a spectacular waterfall in the Delika canyon (Alava) and then enters the Biscay province through the city of Orduña. This waterfall is the largest in Spain with its 222 metres. It re-enters Alava through the towns of Amurrio and Llodio. The river then runs back into Biscay province and out to the Cantabrian sea, entering the Bilbao metropolitan area at Ugao-Miraballes. The tidal influence reaches inland from the sea, in Bilbao&#x27;s old town.

The main tributaries are:

* From the west: &quot;Cadagua&quot; and &quot;Galindo&quot;.
* From the east: &quot;Arratia&quot;, &quot;Ibaizabal&quot; and &quot;Asua&quot;.

The Ibaizabal is considered by some to be an equally important river, so the whole system is often called Nervión-Ibaizabal and the final tract just &quot;Estuary of Bilbao&quot;. The basin area is .

===Naming===
Despite its current popularity in Spanish, the traditional name of the stretch between the estuary and Basauri, where the Ibaizabal and Nervión merge, is &quot;Ibaizabal&quot; (meaning &#x27;wide river&#x27; in Basque), according to historical evidence traced from the eleventh century up to the twentieth. 

Charles Frederick Henningsen, who travelled across the Basque Country during the First Carlist War, calls the river in Bilbao the Ibaizabal. The literary writer from Bilbao Miguel de Unamuno (1864–1936) as well as former mayor of Bilbao Javier Ybarra (1913–1977) refer to it as the Ibaizabal. Geological and hydrological data also seem to support this assumption.

==History and economy==
Since ancient times, the Orduña pass that links Spain&#x27;s inner plateau with the Nervión valley has had a great economic impact. During the Middle Ages it served as a natural border between the Biscay lordship and Castile counties, and tolls were collected there.
Through the centuries, the Nervión valley was a vital communication corridor for Biscay, and the main rail line from Bilbao to the rest of Spain was constructed following the river in 1870.

At the same time, Bilbao developed great commercial activity, with its seaport being the most important on the north coast of Spain. The port&#x27;s activity relied totally on the navigability of the river in its final .
Engineer Evaristo Churruca developed an enormous project that would solve the traditional navigation problems of the river.
The estuary divided the population of Greater Bilbao; the Left Bank was occupied by factories (steel, smelting and shipbuilding) and their workers, the Right Bank was a residential area for the factory owners.

Now that the River Nervión has lost economic importance, the navigable part of the river is being abandoned in favour of the sea port, to allow urban development to take place on the banks of the river after the withdrawal of heavy industry.

The quality of the water has improved through sanitization projects on the river and the disappearance of the most polluting industries.

==Environment==
After a century of intense industrial activity the river, especially the final , was ecologically dead with oxygen levels 20 percent below the norm. This made the Nervión one of the most polluted rivers in the world. In 1990 the local authorities launched a plan to overcome this situation, resulting in a constant improvement of the environmental status that after 15 years has transformed the Nervión in to a clean river, full of aquatic life.

<doc id="636912" wikidata="Q1600805" url="?curid=636912" title="Vaila">
<text>Vaila (Old Norse: &quot;Valey&quot;) is an island in Shetland, Scotland, lying south of the Westland peninsula of the Shetland Mainland. It has an area of , and is at its highest point.

Vaila is home to an organic sheep farm and is also known for its mountain hares.

From 1993, the island was owned by Richard Rowland and his wife, Dorota Rychli. The couple sold it to an undisclosed buyer in 2023.

==History==
The island has been inhabited for thousands of years, and Neolithic and Bronze Age remains have been found there.

Other remains on the island include Mucklaberry Castle tower, which was restored in the 1890s.

In 1490, the Ciske family&#x27;s estates were divided and Vaila and Foula became the property of Alv Knutsson. However, the Ciskes were Norwegian, and as Scotland had annexed Shetland a few decades before, there were confusing and conflicting claims of ownership.

In the 17th century Martin Martin recorded an unusual folk tale:
The inhabitants of the isle Vaila say that no cat will live in it, and if any cat be brought to it, they will rather venture to sea, than stay in the isle. They say that a cat was seen upon the isle about fifty years ago; but how it came there was unknown. They observed about the same time, how the proprietor was in great torment, and as they supposed by witchcraft, of which they say he then died. There is no account that any cat has been seen in the isle ever since that gentleman’s death except when they were carried to it, for making the above-mentioned experiment.
In 1837, Arthur Anderson (the co-founder of P&amp;O), chose the island as the base for his Shetland Fishery Company. This helped end landlords&#x27; dominance of the Shetland fishing industry. The journalist John Sands lived on Vaila for a while during the late 19th century.

Vaila Hall, was built in the 1890s, by Herbert Anderton, a Yorkshire mill owner. It is considered to be one of the finest mansions in all of Shetland. It incorporates an older laird&#x27;s house, built by James Mitchell in 1696. Stone and labour were brought in from England, and ornamentation from even further away: for example, it is thought that the stone griffins may come from Germany.

In 1993, the Andertons sold the island to a solicitor, Richard Rowland, and his Polish wife, Dorota Rychlik. In June 2022, the couple put the island on the market for offers over £1.75 million. It was purchased by an undisclosed buyer early in 2023.

==Geography and geology==

The geology consists of fine dark grey sandstone of the type found in nearby Walls, which was formed 400 million years ago, and subjected to glacial processes. There is some Sandsting granite in the south east by Gaada Stacks.

There are five burns, and four ponds on the island, meaning that it is fairly well watered.

The south end is higher and dominated by Ward Hill (a common name in the Northern Isles), which is divided into West Ward (), Mid Ward and East Ward ().

There are several caves in the south and west, and natural arches on the east and west coasts.

To the north west is Wester Sound, and Easter Sound to the East. Vaila Sound is to the north, and contains one of the many Shetland islands called Linga.

<text>The Goiânia accident was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 13, 1987, in Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil, after an unsecured radiotherapy source was stolen from an abandoned hospital site in the city. It was subsequently handled by many people, resulting in four deaths. About 112,000 people were examined for radioactive contamination and 249 of them were found to have been contaminated.

In the consequent cleanup operation, topsoil had to be removed from several sites, and several houses were demolished. All the objects from within those houses, including personal possessions, were seized and incinerated. &quot;Time&quot; magazine has identified the accident as one of the world&#x27;s &quot;worst nuclear disasters&quot; and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called it &quot;one of the world&#x27;s worst radiological incidents&quot;.

== Description of the source ==

The radiation source in the Goiânia accident was a small capsule containing about of highly radioactive caesium chloride (a caesium salt made with a radioisotope, caesium-137) encased in a shielding canister made of lead and steel. The source was positioned in a container of the wheel type, where the wheel turns inside the casing to move the source between the storage and irradiation positions.

The activity of the source was 74 terabecquerels (TBq) in 1971. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) describes the container as an &quot;international standard capsule&quot;. It was 51 millimeters (2 inches) in diameter and 48 mm (1.8 inches) long. The specific activity of the active solid was about 814 TBq·kg−1 of caesium-137, an isotope whose half life is 30 years. The dose rate at one meter from the source was 4.56 grays per hour (456 rad·h−1). While the serial number of the device was unknown, hindering the ability to verify its identity, the device was thought to have been made in the U.S. at Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a radiation source for radiation therapy at the Goiânia hospital.

The IAEA states that the source contained when it was taken and that about of contamination had been recovered during the cleanup operation. This means that remained in the environment; it would have decayed to about by 2016.

== Events ==

=== Hospital abandonment ===
The (IGR), a private radiotherapy institute in Goiânia, was northwest of , the administrative center of the city. When IGR moved to its new premises in 1985, it left behind a caesium-137-based teletherapy unit purchased in 1977. The fate of the abandoned site was disputed in court between IGR and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, then owner of the premises. On September 11, 1986, the Court of Goiás stated it had knowledge of the abandoned radioactive material in the building.

Four months before the theft, on May 4, 1987, Saura Taniguti, then director of Ipasgo, the institute of insurance for civil servants, used police force to prevent one of the owners of IGR, Carlos Figueiredo Bezerril, from removing the radioactive material that had been left behind. Figueiredo then warned the president of Ipasgo, Lício Teixeira Borges, that he should take responsibility &quot;for what would happen with the caesium bomb&quot;. The Court of Goiás posted a security guard to protect the site. Meanwhile, the owners of IGR wrote several letters to the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), warning them about the danger of keeping a teletherapy unit at an abandoned site, but they could not remove the equipment on their own once a court order prevented them from doing so.

=== Theft of the source ===
On September 13, 1987, the guard tasked with protecting the site did not show up for work. Roberto dos Santos Alves and Wagner Mota Pereira illegally entered the partially demolished IGR site. They partially disassembled the teletherapy unit and placed the source assembly in a wheelbarrow to later take to Roberto&#x27;s home. They thought they might get some scrap value for the unit. They began dismantling the equipment. That same evening, they both began to vomit due to radiation sickness. The following day, Pereira began to experience diarrhea and dizziness, and his left hand began to swell. He later developed a burn on his hand in the same size and shape as the aperture, and he underwent partial amputation of several fingers.

On September 15, Pereira visited a local clinic, where he was diagnosed with a foodborne illness; he was told to return home and rest. Roberto, however, continued with his efforts to dismantle the equipment and eventually freed the caesium capsule from its protective rotating head. His prolonged exposure to the radioactive material led to his right forearm becoming ulcerated, requiring amputation on October 14.

=== Opening the capsule ===
On September 16, Roberto punctured the capsule&#x27;s aperture window with a screwdriver, allowing him to see a deep blue light coming from the tiny opening he had created. He inserted the screwdriver and successfully scooped out some of the glowing substance. Thinking it was perhaps a type of gunpowder, he tried to light it, but the powder would not ignite. 

The exact mechanism by which the blue light was generated was not known at the time the IAEA report of the incident was written, though it was thought to be either ionized air glow, fluorescence, or Cherenkov radiation associated with the absorption of moisture by the source; a similar blue light was observed in 1988 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States during the disencapsulation of a caesium-137 source.

=== Source is sold and dismantled ===
On September 18, Roberto sold the items to a nearby scrapyard. That night, Devair Alves Ferreira, the owner of the scrapyard, noticed the blue glow from the punctured capsule. Thinking the capsule&#x27;s contents were valuable or supernatural, he immediately brought it into his house. Over the next three days, he invited friends and family to view the strange glowing powder.

On September 21, at the scrapyard, one of Ferreira&#x27;s friends (identified as &quot;EF1&quot; in the IAEA report) freed several rice-sized grains of the glowing material from the capsule using a screwdriver. Ferreira began to share some of them with various friends and family members. That same day, his wife, 37-year-old Maria Gabriela Ferreira, began to fall ill. On September 25, 1987, Devair Ferreira sold the scrap metal to a third scrapyard.

=== Ivo and his family ===
The day before the sale to the third scrapyard, on September 24, Ivo, Devair&#x27;s brother, successfully scraped some additional dust out of the source and took it to his house a short distance away. There he spread some of it on the concrete floor. His six-year-old daughter, Leide das Neves Ferreira, later ate an egg sandwich while sitting on the floor. She was also fascinated by the blue glow of the powder, applying it to her body and showing it off to her mother. The egg sandwich was also exposed to dust from the powder; Leide absorbed 1.0 GBq and received a total dose of 6.0 Gy, a fatal dose for which medical intervention was ineffective. Leide&#x27;s mother, Lurdes Ferreira, also got sick from the radiation.

=== Maria Gabriela Ferreira notifies authorities ===
Maria Gabriela Ferreira had been the first to notice that many people around her had become severely ill at the same time. On September 28, 1987 – fifteen days after the item was found – she reclaimed the materials from the rival scrapyard and transported them to a hospital.

=== Source&#x27;s radioactivity is detected ===
In the morning of September 29, a visiting medical physicist used a scintillation counter to confirm the presence of radioactivity and persuaded the authorities to take immediate action. The city, state, and national governments were all aware of the incident by the end of the day.

== Health outcomes ==
News of the radiation incident was broadcast on local, national, and international media. Within days, nearly 130,000 people in Goiânia flooded local hospitals, concerned that they might have been exposed. Of those, 249 were indeed found to be contaminated – some with radioactive residue still on their skin – through the use of Geiger counters. Eventually, twenty people showed signs of radiation sickness and required treatment.

=== Fatalities ===
Ages in years are given, with dosages listed in grays (Gy).

* Admilson Alves de Souza, aged 18 (5.3 Gy), was an employee of Devair Ferreira who worked on the radioactive source. He developed lung damage, internal bleeding, and heart damage, and died October 28, 1987.
* Leide das Neves Ferreira, aged 6 (6.0 Gy), was the daughter of Ivo Ferreira. When an international team arrived to treat her, she was discovered confined to an isolated room in the hospital because the staff were afraid to go near her. She gradually experienced swelling in the upper body, hair loss, kidney and lung damage, and internal bleeding. She died on October 23, 1987, of &quot;septicemia and generalized infection&quot; at the Marcilio Dias Navy Hospital, in Rio de Janeiro. She was buried in a common cemetery in Goiânia, in a special fiberglass coffin lined with lead to prevent the spread of radiation. Despite these measures, news of her impending burial caused a riot of more than 2,000 people in the cemetery on the day of her burial, all fearing that her corpse would poison the surrounding land. Rioters tried to prevent her burial by using stones and bricks to block the cemetery roadway. She was buried despite this interference. 
* Maria Gabriela Ferreira, a 37-year-old woman (exposed to 5.7 Gy), was the wife of scrapyard owner Devair Ferreira and who turned the material over to the authorities. She became sick about three days after coming into contact with the substance. Her condition worsened, and she developed hair loss and internal bleeding, especially of the limbs, eyes, and digestive tract. She suffered mental confusion, diarrhea, and acute renal insufficiency before dying on October 23, 1987, the same day as her niece, of &quot;septicemia and generalized infection&quot;, about a month after exposure.
* Israel Batista dos Santos, aged 22 (4.5 Gy), was also an employee of Devair Ferreira who worked on the radioactive source primarily to extract the lead. He developed serious respiratory and lymphatic complications, was eventually admitted to the hospital, and died six days later on October 27, 1987.

Devair Ferreira survived despite receiving 7 Gy of radiation. He died in 1994 of cirrhosis aggravated by depression and binge drinking. Ivo Ferreira died of emphysema in 2003.

=== Other individuals ===
The outcomes for the 46 most contaminated people are shown in the bar chart below. Several people survived high doses of radiation. This is thought in some cases to be because the dose was fractionated. Given time, the body&#x27;s repair mechanisms will reverse cell damage caused by radiation. If the dose is spread over a long time period, these mechanisms can mitigate the effects of radiation poisoning.

=== Other affected people ===
Afterwards, about 112,000 people were examined for radioactive contamination; 249 were found to have significant levels of radioactive material in or on their body. Of this group, 129 people had internal contamination. The majority of the internally contaminated people only suffered small doses (, corresponding to less than about 1 in 200 excess risk of developing cancer later in life. A thousand people were identified as having suffered a dose which was greater than one year of background radiation; it is thought that 97% of these people had a dose of between 10 and 200 mSv (between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 50 excess risk of developing cancer as a result).

In 2007, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation determined that the rate of caesium-137 related diseases are the same in Goiânia accident survivors as they are in the population at large. Nevertheless, compensation is still distributed to survivors, who suffer radiation-related prejudices in everyday life.

== Legal matters ==
In addition to a public civil action for damages to the environment that was brought in September 1995 by the Federal Public Prosecution Service (Department of Justice), together with the State of Goiás’ Public Prosecution Service, before the 8th Federal Court of Goiânia, legal proceedings were also brought against the Federal Union; the National Nuclear Energy Commission; the State of Goiás (through its Health Department); the Social Security Institute for Civil Servants in the State of Goiás – IPASGO, which at the time of the accident was the private owner of the land where the IGR was located; the four medical doctors who owned IGR; and the clinic’s
physicist, who was also the supervisor.

On March 17, 2000, the 8th Federal Court of Goiás ordered the defendants to pay compensation of R$1.3 million (near US$750,000) to the Defence of the Diffused Rights Fund, a federal fund for the compensation of damage to the environment, consumers, property and rights of artistic, historic, or cultural value and other collective rights.

In his sentence, the Judge excluded the state of Goiás and the Federal Union from the payment
of compensation.

The CNEN was ordered to pay compensation of R$1 million, to guarantee medical and psychological treatment for the direct and indirect victims of the accident and their descendants down to the third generation, to provide transportation to medical exams for the most serious victims, and was responsible for the medical follow-up for the people of Abadia de Goiás city.

The Social Security Institute for Civil Servants in the State of Goiás, IPASGO, was ordered to
pay a fine of R$100 000, plus interest as of 13 September 1987, the date of removal of the caesium-137 capsule.

As the accidents occurred before the promulgation of the Federal Constitution of 1988 and because the substance was acquired by the clinic and not by the individual owners, the court could not declare the owners of IGR liable. However, one of the owners was fined R$100 000 because he was found liable for the abandoned state of the IGR building where the caesium source was kept, including the removal of gates, windows, timberwork and the roof in May 1987.

The clinic’s physicist was also fined R$100 000 because he was the technician responsible for the control
of the medical manipulation of the radiological device.

Although the two thieves were not included as defendants in the public civil suit, the judgement of the court found them directly responsible for the accident. If they had been arraigned as defendants, they certainly would have been convicted, as their actions led to strict (no-fault) liability. However, in terms of criminal intent, they were not aware of the seriousness of their actions in removing the caesium source from its location, and they had no knowledge of the dangers of the radiological device; moreover, there was no danger sign erected in the abandoned clinic in order to ward off intruders.

== Cleanup ==
=== Objects and places ===
Topsoil had to be removed from several sites, and several houses were demolished. All the objects from within those houses were removed and examined. Those that were found to be free of radioactivity were wrapped in plastic bags, while those that were contaminated were either decontaminated or disposed of as waste. In industry, the choice between decontaminating or disposing objects is based on only the economic value of the object and the ease of decontamination. In this case, the IAEA recognized that to reduce the psychological impact of the event, greater effort should have been taken to clean up items of personal value, such as jewelry and photographs. It is not clear from the IAEA report to what degree this was practised.

=== Means and methods ===
After the houses were emptied, vacuum cleaners were used to remove dust, and plumbing was examined for radioactivity. Painted surfaces could be scraped, while floors were treated with acid and Prussian blue mixtures. Roofs were vacuumed and hosed, but two houses had to have their roofs removed. The waste from the cleanup was moved out of the city to a remote place for storage. Aeroradiometric operations were undertaken by low-altitude survey, which was carried out over Goiânia. The radiometric equipment and materials available at the IRD were quickly transported and mounted on a Eurocopter AS350 Écureuil helicopter provided by the police of the state of Goiás.

Potassium alum dissolved in hydrochloric acid was used on clay, concrete, soil, and roofs. Caesium has a high affinity for many clays. Organic solvents, followed by potassium alum dissolved in hydrochloric acid, were used to treat waxed/greased floors and tables. Sodium hydroxide solutions, also followed by dissolved potassium alum, were used to treat synthetic floors, machines and typewriters.

Prussian blue was used to internally decontaminate many people, although by the time it was applied, much of the radioactive material had already migrated from the bloodstream to muscle tissue, greatly hampering its effectiveness. Urine from victims was treated with ion-exchange resin to compact the waste for ease of storage.

=== Recovery considerations ===
The cleanup operation was much harder for this event than it could have been because the source was opened and the active material was water-soluble. A sealed source need only be picked up, placed in a lead container, and transported to the radioactive waste storage. In the recovery of lost sources, the IAEA recommends careful planning and using a crane or other device to place shielding (such as a pallet of bricks or a concrete block) near the source to protect recovery workers.

=== Contamination locations ===
The Goiânia accident spread significant radioactive contamination throughout the Aeroporto, Central, and Ferroviários districts. Even after the cleanup, 7 TBq of radioactivity remained unaccounted for.

Some of the key contamination sites:
* Goiânia&#x27;s (IGR) (), despite being the origin of the radiation source, suffered no actual exposure or breach of radioactive contents. IGR moved its clinic to another location in the city, with the previous site having been replaced around 2000 with the modernized (Goiânia Convention Center).
* Roberto dos Santos&#x27; house () on Rua 57. The radioactive source was here for about six days, and it was partially broken into.
* Devair Ferreira&#x27;s scrapyard (), on Rua 15A (&quot;Junkyard I&quot;) in the Aeroporto section of the city, had possession of the items for seven days. The caesium container was entirely dismantled, spreading significant contamination. Extreme radiation levels of up to 1.5 Sv·h−1 were found by investigators in the middle of the scrapyard.
* Ivo Ferreira&#x27;s house () (&quot;Junkyard II&quot;), at 1F Rua 6. Some of the contamination was spread about the house, fatally poisoning Leide das Neves Ferreira and Maria Gabriela Ferreira. The adjacent junkyard scavenged the remainder of parts from the IGR facility. The premises were heavily contaminated, with radiation dose rates up to 2 Sv·h−1.
* &quot;Junkyard III&quot; (). This junkyard had possession of the items for three days until they were sent away.
* (). Here, the substance was quarantined, and an official cleanup response began.

Other contamination was also found in or on:
* Three buses
* 42 houses
* fourteen cars
* five pigs
* 50,000 rolls of toilet paper

== Legacy ==

===Disposal of the capsule===
The original teletherapy capsule was seized by the Brazilian military as soon as it was discovered, and since then the empty capsule has been on display at the (&quot;School of Specialized Instruction&quot;) in Rio de Janeiro as a memento to those who participated in the cleanup of the contaminated area.

=== Research ===
In 1991, a group of researchers collected blood samples from highly exposed survivors of the incident. Subsequent analysis resulted in the publication of numerous scientific articles.

=== In popular culture ===
A 1990 film, (&quot;Caesium-137 – The Nightmare of Goiânia&quot;), a dramatisation of the incident, was made by Roberto Pires. It won several awards at the 1990 Festival de Brasília. An episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Thine Own Self,&quot; was partially inspired by the accident.

===Economic implications===
Much of the radioactive substances were cleared after testing. However a gloom hung over the local residents, as they were asked for certificates stating that they were free of radioactivity. Also banned products from Goiânia created a public outcry, citing unjust discrimination.

=== Foundation ===
The state government of Goiás established the in February 1988, both to study the extent of contamination of the population as a result of the incident and to render aid to those affected.

<doc id="636916" wikidata="Q512130" url="?curid=636916" title="That's Life!">
<text>That&#x27;s Life! was a satirical consumer affairs programme on the BBC, at its height regularly reaching audiences of fifteen to twenty million, and receiving between 10,000 and 15,000 letters a week. The series was broadcast on BBC1 for 21 years, from 26 May 1973 until 19 June 1994.

==Format==
&quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; was a magazine programme that blended light-hearted observations on everyday life, reports on consumer affairs (often blended with satire), and hard-hitting investigations in a studio-based format, with film inserts. Devised by Peter Chafer, John Lloyd and Esther Rantzen, it was presented and produced by Esther Rantzen with various teams of reporters and contributors. Special spin-off programmes concentrated on serious topics that were first aired on &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;, such as childbirth, mental health and child abuse. The programme&#x27;s journalism relied on the skills of researchers many of whom went on to hold senior jobs both inside and outside the media industry.

The large audiences, regularly topping the ratings charts and reaching a maximum of 22.5 million viewers, resulted in several changes in laws and practice, such as the introduction of compulsory seat belts for children, support for transplantation and the installing of safe surfaces in children&#x27;s playgrounds.

==Origins==
Bernard Braden, the Canadian actor and broadcaster, invented consumer programmes for British television with his ITV show &quot;On the Braden Beat&quot;. When in 1968 Braden and his wife Barbara Kelly agreed to transfer to the BBC, he starred with her in a situation comedy for the Entertainment Department, and he presented a consumer show which was produced in Desmond Wilcox&#x27;s Features Department. John Lloyd was a freelance producer who had worked with Braden on the ITV consumer show, and in 1968 was hired to produce &quot;Braden&#x27;s Week&quot; for the BBC. That show ran from 1968 to 1972 on Saturday nights on BBC1, featuring Esther Rantzen and John Pitman as reporters, and Ronald Fletcher, Chris Munds and Hilary Pritchard as humorous punctuation. It also featured Frankie Howerd, Victor Ross of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, and an expose of Robert Maxwell&#x27;s company Pergamon Press.

The format was highly popular and included a studio audience, a regular music slot featuring singer/songwriter Jake Thackray, and sketches performed by Munds and Pritchard. It is sometimes wrongly thought that Braden was sacked by the BBC for making a commercial for Stork margarine in the summer of 1971, and although advertising a product was not felt compatible with Braden&#x27;s role in a consumer show, Desmond Wilcox interceded for him with BBC senior executives, pointing out that at the time he was not under contract to the BBC, and he returned to make another series that autumn.

In 1972, however, Braden was hired by a Canadian network to create a similar programme there. After he left, producers Peter Chafer, John Lloyd and presenter Esther Rantzen were tasked by the BBC to create a replacement consumer programme without Braden. Rantzen invented the title, &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; When Bernard Braden returned to the UK having completed his contract to make a consumer programme in Canada, his show &quot;Braden&#x27;s Week&quot; had been replaced in his absence, and Esther Rantzen was fronting &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; Braden&#x27;s wife Barbara Kelly never forgave Rantzen, who she was convinced had stolen the role from Braden and had only been given the job because she was in a relationship with (and later married to) Features Department head Desmond Wilcox.

=== Launch of &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; ===
The first series of &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; broadcast in the summer of 1973 was written by John Lloyd, executive-produced by Peter Chafer and was presented by Esther Rantzen, George Layton (actor, director and screenwriter) and Bob Wellings (co-presenter of the nightly current affairs magazine programme Nationwide). A regular feature was &quot;Heap of the Week&quot; filmed by Bill Nicholson, later a novelist and Oscar-nominated screenwriter. At the end of the run the Controller of BBC1 decided that the show had potential, but not with that presentation team, since only Rantzen was comfortable in the consumer role.

A second series was commissioned for which Rantzen was promoted to producer and presenter, a role she held for the next twenty years. Kieran Prendiville, a journalist who had worked on &quot;Man Alive&quot; (and who was part of the &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; production team at the beginning) and actor Glyn Worsnip, both joined the team as reporters and stayed for five years.

=== &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; investigations ===
==== Swindles ====
During the programme&#x27;s 21 years, many investigations highlighted dangers, swindles and injustices. Among the conmen were Peter Foster who was first exposed for selling a fake &quot;slimming&quot; tea called Bai Lin, various door-to-door salesmen selling double glazing, Coach House Finance based in Colchester in 1975 which resulted in a conviction for fraud, and many fake slimming aids.

==== Safety items ====
Including stories publicising dangerous cots, lifts, taxi doors, the introduction of safe playground surfaces, and inspiring the legal requirement for seat belts for children in cars.

==== Child abuse ====
This was regularly exposed on the programme. The launch of Childline by Esther Rantzen was inspired by a helpline for abused children set up after one episode of the programme.

=== Significant campaigns ===
==== Ben Hardwick ====

Ben Hardwick was a two-year-old toddler dying of biliary atresia, with only a few weeks to live. He was being treated by Professor Sir Roy Calne in Addenbrooks Hospital who told his mother Debbie that Ben&#x27;s only hope would be a liver transplant, but transplantation had virtually ceased in the UK due to a &quot;Panorama&quot; documentary which implied that organs were being taken from patients who were still alive. Professor Calne suggested the only way to encourage organ donation would be to tell Ben&#x27;s story on TV, Debbie therefore contacted &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;

The film of Ben captured the nation&#x27;s imagination, a donor (Matthew Fewkes) was found and Ben lived for another year. On his death, Marti Webb recorded his favourite song, &quot;Ben&quot; to raise money for a charity founded in his name, and Shaun Woodward and Esther Rantzen wrote a book &quot;Story of Ben Hardwick by Shaun Woodward and Esther Rantzen&quot; which also raised money for the Ben Hardwick Fund which still exists. The impact of Ben&#x27;s story doubled the number of transplants &quot;

==== &quot;The Scandal of Crookham Court&quot; ====
A letter to Esther Rantzen which was forwarded to her by Childline came from a boy at the boarding school, Crookham Court School in Newbury, who had been sexually abused by the owner of the school and had discovered that his brother was also sexually abused by another teacher. A three-month investigation uncovered widespread abuse of the boys in the school; Rantzen, Woolfe and Hereward Harrison (a Childline executive) visited the school to speak to pupils. Paedophile Philip Cadman was the millionaire owner of the school who was later tried and convicted of abuse, as were teachers Bill Printer and Philip Edmonds.

A special programme, &quot;The Scandal of Crookham Court&quot;, reconstructed the court case at which the children gave evidence. Author Ian Mucklejohn assisted the investigation and has written a book based on his experience teaching at the school and the evidence of pupils who suffered abuse there.

==== Sir Nicholas Winton, the British Schindler ====
Sir Nicholas Winton was revealed for the first time on &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; as having rescued a generation of Czech children from the Holocaust. Unknown to him, or them, Sir Nicholas was placed in the audience next to three people and about twenty others around him who had been on the trains he organised and owed their life to him. Piers Morgan described it as the &quot;best moment of television he had ever seen&quot;. It has been viewed on Facebook and YouTube more than forty million times. For his actions, Winton has been compared by the British press to Oskar Schindler.

A biography of Winton was written by his daughter, &quot;The Life of Sir Nicholas Winton&quot; by Barbara Winton, and documentaries were later made about his achievements. Other members of his team included Trevor Chadwick and Doreen Warriner.

==== Bullying ====
An anti-bullying campaign was inspired by the suicide of teenager Katharine Bamber, after a phone call to the programme from her mother Susan. It resulted in schools adopting anti-bullying policies.

=== Music on &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; ===
Although the &quot;Braden&#x27;s Week&quot; comedy sketches were discontinued, music was still provided each week by a range of artists, including Alex Glasgow, Jake Thackray, Five Penny Piece, Richard Stilgoe and Victoria Wood. For many years the British drummer and composer Tony Kinsey was musical director and arranged the title song &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; for the Hanwell Brass Band. Eventually the musical interludes were provided by non-singers; staff of big companies sang &quot;The Lay of the Week&quot; to customers who complained, and unsuspecting members of the public became a choir in &quot;Get Britain Singing&quot; in which the team of reporters went undercover in gloomy locations such as service stations and hospitals in order to startle people with a cheerful blast of music that inspired them to burst into song.

In 1992, &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; talent contest called Search for a Star discovered singer Alison Jordan, and record producer Simon Cowell who offered a contract as the top prize.

=== Humorous items on &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; ===
Rude vegetables sent in by viewers were notably memorable, cropping up in &quot;The Times&quot; more than 20 years after &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; ended. Also popular were the talented pets discovered by the show, which included dogs that played football, a cat who played ping-pong, dogs who caught soda water from a syphon and many others including a horse that could count. Besides the pets there were &quot;talented tots&quot;, such as toddlers who could play the piano, snooker and golf.

Talented passers-by were also featured each week in the vox pops at the start of the show, including Annie Mizen, who was discovered in a street market in her eighties and became a star.

Esther Rantzen was arrested for obstruction when vox popping in the North End Road. The resulting film took pride of place in her edition of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in which the arresting officer P.C. A. Herbert was a surprise guest.

During its 21-year run &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; was broadcast three times on 1 April, and each time created a prank film to fool the viewers. The first directed by Nick Handel appeared to show a dog that could drive. The second was an animal in London Zoo called a Lirpa Loof. starring David Bellamy, which persuaded charabanc-loads of visitors to search the zoo for the non-existent animal with purple droppings. The third was a face cream made from rhinoceros spit that eradicated wrinkles from the face but transferred them to a backside.

=== &quot;That&#x27;s Life All Over!&quot; ===
In 1994 the show ended with a 90-minute special recalling the most memorable moments and listing some of the changes inspired by the series. &quot;That&#x27;s Life All Over!&quot; included a surprise section that Rantzen did not know about in advance, hosted by David Frost.

In April 2024 Kirsty Wark presented an edition of the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Reunion&quot;, with guests George Layton, Chris Serle, Paul Heiney, Bill Buckley, Adrian Mills, Sir Peter Bazalgette, Jane Elsdon Dew and Esther Rantzen.

== &quot;Esther Rantzen&#x27;s House Trap&quot; and &quot;Do The Right Thing&quot; ==
In October 2018, it was announced that a consumer show, &quot;Do The Right Thing&quot; would air on Channel 5, with Rantzen presenting alongside Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. Another Channel 5 consumer programme, &quot;Esther Rantzen&#x27;s House Trap&quot; was a production more in keeping with the format of the BBC&#x27;s long-running &quot;Watchdog&quot; programme, with hidden cameras trying to trap rogue traders in the homes of a number of undercover actors. Unlike &quot;Watchdog&quot;, these actors were all people of an advanced age with each episode focusing on a different trade, such as locksmiths, where older people were likely to being preyed upon.

&quot;Esther Rantzen&#x27;s House Trap&quot; was a four-part series produced by Karen Plumb and Grant Mansfield at Plimsoll Productions for Channel 5, who commissioned the show alongside other consumer-focused shows such as &quot;Shop Smart Save Money&quot; and &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;.

<text>Ausona (today Ausonia) was a 4th-century city in the central Italian region of Latium. It was one of the three cities possessed by the tribe of the Ausones and its name seems to imply that it was their chief city or metropolis (the others were Cales and Aurunca). It is only once mentioned in history: during the Second Samnite War (326–304 ), when—the Ausones having revolted against the Romans—all three of their cities were betrayed into the hands of the Roman consuls, and their inhabitants put to the sword without mercy. No subsequent notice is found of Ausona; but it is supposed to have been situated on the banks of the little river still called Ausente, which flows into the Liris near its mouth. The plain below the modern village of Le Fratte, near the sources of this little stream, is still known as the &quot;Piano dell&#x27;Ausente&quot;; and some remains of a Roman town have been discovered there.

<text>The Neuse River ( , Tuscarora: Neyuherú·kęʔkì·nęʔ) is a river rising in the Piedmont of North Carolina and emptying into Pamlico Sound below New Bern. Its total length is approximately , making it the longest river entirely contained in North Carolina. The Trent River joins the Neuse at New Bern. Its drainage basin, measuring in area, also lies entirely inside North Carolina. It is formed by the confluence of the Flat and Eno rivers prior to entering the Falls Lake reservoir in northern Wake County. Its fall line shoals, known as the &quot;Falls of the Neuse&quot;, lie submerged under the waters of Falls Lake. This River also creates the beauty of the Neuse River Trail, a long greenway that stretches from Falls Lake Dam, Raleigh, North Carolina to Legend Park, Clayton, North Carolina.

==Geography==

The Neuse begins at the confluence of the Flat and Eno rivers near Durham, North Carolina. The river enters Pamlico Sound just east of Maw Point Shoal near Hobucken, North Carolina while en route to the Atlantic Ocean.

Typical of rivers in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, the Neuse enters a basin of chocolate intermittent bottomland swamp on its journey towards its outlet. One interesting exception is the &quot;Cliffs of the Neuse&quot; area near Goldsboro, where the river cuts a narrow 30 m (90 ft) gorge through limestone and sandstone bluffs. The Neuse is prone to extremes in its flow carriage, often escaping its banks during wet periods, then reducing to a trickle that can be forded on foot during prolonged drought conditions.
The Neuse flows through parts of seven counties. Major cities and towns in proximity to the Neuse are Durham; Neuse Township; Raleigh, the capital of North Carolina; Smithfield; Goldsboro; Kinston and New Bern.
==History==
For thousands of years before the Europeans arrived, different civilizations of indigenous peoples lived along the river. Many artifacts found along its banks have been traced to ancient prehistoric Native American settlements. Archaeological studies have shown waves of habitation.

The river has one of the three oldest surviving English-applied placenames in the U.S. Explorers named the Neuse River after the American Indian tribe known as Neusiok, with whom the early Raleigh expeditions made contact. They also identified the region as the &quot;Neusiok&quot;. Two English captains, Arthur Barlowe and Phillip Amadas, were commissioned by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584 to explore the New World. They landed on North Carolina&#x27;s coast July 2, 1584, to begin their research. In their 1585 report to Raleigh, they wrote favorably of the Indian population in &quot;… the country Neusiok, situated upon a goodly river called Neuse …&quot;, as it was called by the local population.

In 1865 during the American Civil War, the Confederates burned one of the last ironclad warships which they had built, the &quot;Ram Neuse&quot;, to prevent its capture by Union troops. The level of the river had fallen so that it prevented the ship from passing downriver. Nearly a century later, during another period of historically low water, the remains of the ship were discovered. It was raised in 1963. Later, the ship was installed beside the river at the Governor Caswell Memorial in Kinston.

William Larry Stewart II, a.k.a. Billy Stewart (March 24, 1937 – January 17, 1970), an American rhythm and blues singer and pianist, died in a broad-daylight car accident in January 1970, just two months prior to his 33rd birthday. The accident happened when the Ford Thunderbird that Stewart was driving approached a bridge across the Neuse River near Smithfield, North Carolina. His car left the highway, ran along the median strip at a slight angle to the highway, struck the bridge abutment, and then plunged into the river, killing Stewart and his three passengers instantly.

The low-head Quaker Neck Dam was built in 1952 at Neuse River kilometer 225 to impound cooling water for a steam electric plant. A fish ladder was included. The dam was removed in May 1998, opening up access for anadromous fish to of the mainstem Neuse River.

==Water quality==

The Neuse has been plagued in recent years with environmental and public health problems related to municipal and agricultural waste water discharge, storm runoff, and other sources of pollution. Pollution was particularly bad in the aftermath of hurricanes Fran and Floyd in the late 1990s.

The dinoflagellate &quot;Pfiesteria piscicida&quot; is present in the river, and has a bloom in growth when nutrient levels are increased due to too much runoff. This organism may be connected to fish kills as well as adverse health effects in grapes.

<text>Cenarth () is a village, parish and community in Carmarthenshire, on the border between Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, and close to the border with Pembrokeshire, Wales. It stands on the banks of the River Teifi, east of Cardigan and west of Newcastle Emlyn, and features the Cenarth Falls, a popular visitor attraction, and several other listed structures including an 18th-century corn mill incorporating the National Coracle Centre.

== History and governance ==
The ancient parish extended south of the river, and included the town of Newcastle Emlyn. In 1934, it annexed the adjoining parish of East Cilrhedyn, and the enlarged parish corresponds with the modern community, which had a population of 1,022 in the 2001 census. With the community of Newcastle Emlyn, it makes up the Carmarthenshire electoral ward of Cenarth, which had a population of 1,995 in 2001, with 60 per cent Welsh language speakers. The ancient parish (less Newcastle Emlyn) had an area of . Its census populations were: 672 (1801); 897 (1851); 638 (1901). The percentage of Welsh-speakers was 98 (1891); 96 (1931).

The enlarged parish (post-1934) had an area of . Its census populations were: 1098 (1951); 1066 (1961); 926 (1971); 971 (1981). The percentage of Welsh-speakers was 92 (1951); 91 (1961); 82 (1971); 69 (1981).

The community is bordered by the communities of: Newcastle Emlyn; Llangeler; Cynwyl Elfed; and Trelech, all being in Carmarthenshire; by Clydau and Manordeifi in Pembrokeshire; and by Beulah, Pen-y-wenallt, and Llandyfriog in Ceredigion.

==Features==
East of the village, the River Teifi emerges from a deep ravine over a ledge that produces a spectacular waterfall when the river is in full spate and this attracts many visitors throughout the year. A dramatic painting of the falls was made by Frank Miles and is now at Nottingham City Museum. Miles&#x27;s father inherited Cardigan Priory from his father, Philip John Miles, but lived in Nottinghamshire as Rector of Bingham.
A dominant feature of the village is Cenarth Bridge over the Teifi west of the falls; the bridge was built in 1787 by William Edwards of Eglwysilan and his son David. The bridge features their trademark series of circular holes (perforated spandrels that allow the weight of the structure to be reduced without losing strength. The bridge is a Grade II*-listed structure and is partly in Carmarthenshire and partly in Ceredigion.

Other visitor attractions are a seventeenth-century flour mill and coracle museum. The village is home to the National Coracle Centre.

==Worship==
The parish church is dedicated to the local saint, St Llawddog. Although the present building is relatively modern, it is on an important ancient site, and was the &quot;bishop house&quot; of the cantref of Emlyn.

<text>Stephen Cuthbert Vivian Dodgson (17 March 192413 April 2013) was a British composer and broadcaster. Dodgson&#x27;s prolific musical output covered most genres, ranging from opera and large-scale orchestral music to chamber and instrumental music, as well as choral works and song. Three instruments to which he dedicated particular attention were the guitar, harpsichord and recorder. He wrote in a mainly tonal, although sometimes unconventional, idiom. Some of his works use unusual combinations of instruments.

== Biography ==
Stephen Dodgson was born in Chelsea, London in 1924, the third child of John Arthur Dodgson, who was a symbolist painter and nephew of Campbell Dodgson, and his wife, who was born Margaret Valentine Pease and also an artist. He was distant cousin of Lewis Carroll. He was educated at Berkhamsted School in Hertfordshire and at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. In 1942, he was conscripted into the Royal Navy and took part in anti-submarine warfare escorting convoys in the Battle of the Atlantic.

On returning to London, he studied composition privately for a year with Bernard Stevens before enrolling at the Royal College of Music in 1946, officially to study the horn (under Frank Probyn), but in practice he was able to focus on composition under the guidance of R. O. Morris, Patrick Hadley and Antony Hopkins. While Morris instilled an interest in counterpoint and music from past centuries, such as that of the madrigalist Thomas Morley, Hadley and Hopkins provided more practical tuition.

Dodgson&#x27;s early compositions won several prizes, including the Cobbett Competition for a Fantasy String Quartet (1948) and two Royal Philharmonic Society prizes: for his Variations for Orchestra (1949) and the Symphony in E Flat (1953). In 1949, he also won an Octavia travelling scholarship, which sent him to Rome. After returning to London in the spring of 1950, his music increasingly attracted performances and broadcasts by prominent players (including flautist Geoffrey Gilbert, oboist Evelyn Barbirolli, harpist Maria Korchinska, violinist Neville Marriner, violist Watson Forbes, the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble), and conductors such as Leslie Woodgate, Paul Steinitz and the composer Gerald Finzi. After initially making a living with teaching work in schools and colleges, in 1956 Dodgson was able to return to the Royal College of Music in a teaching capacity (where he also conducted the junior orchestra). In 1965 he was appointed professor of composition and music theory, a post he held until his retirement in 1982.

Two of the instruments which held special places in Dodgson&#x27;s were the guitar and the harpsichord. His introduction to harpsichord writing came through one of the instrument&#x27;s first twentieth-century exponents, the Czech player and musicologist, Stanislav Heller. In 1959, four years after writing his first pieces for the instrument he married Jane Clark, herself a harpsichordist and an authority on François Couperin. His wife fostered an increasing fascination with early and Baroque music.

He first came to write for the guitar—an instrument with which Dodgson is perhaps especially associated—in the early 1950s when Alexis Chesnakov, a Russian actor exiled in Britain, requested some folksong settings. Although Dodgson lacked any practical knowledge of the instrument, by the time of his Guitar Concerto No 1, completed in 1956, he had come to write for it idiomatically. This concerto was written for Julian Bream, but in his absence it was premiered by a 17-year-old John Williams (with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Walter Goehr), for whom he later wrote the Guitar Concerto No 2 (1972).

From 1957 onwards, he broadcast regularly on BBC Radio and wrote the music for many radio plays, often (from 1961 onwards) in friendly collaboration with the producer Raymond Raikes. In 1986 he became chairman of the National Youth Wind Orchestra of Great Britain, for which he wrote several pieces.

Recorder player John Turner remembers him as &quot;Enthusiastic, ebullient and quick-witted... extremely voluble, with a strong, distinctive voice, an ever-present smile, much old-world courtesy, and an idiosyncratic gait.&quot;

Stephen Dodgson died on 13 April 2013, aged 89. He is said to have remained remarkably active until the last few months of his life.

==Music==
Dodgson&#x27;s musical output covers most genres, ranging from opera, large-scale orchestral music and wind-band works to chamber and instrumental music, along with choral works and song. He deployed an unusually wide variety of solo instruments. One of the few recent composers to write idiomatically for the harpsichord, clavichord and harp, he may be the first since the eighteenth century to have written for baryton trio. He wrote concertos for instruments ranging from the viola da gamba to the bass trombone. Three instruments to which he dedicated particular attention were the guitar, harpsichord and recorder, and one of his works, High Barbaree (1999), is actually scored for all three.

Guitarists who had works dedicated to them by Dodgson include Julian Bream, Gabriel Estarellas, Angelo Gilardino, Nicola Hall, John Williams, the Eden-Stell Duo and the Fragnito-Matarazzo Duo. In addition to a large number of solo works, among which are six virtuoso piano sonatas, this includes ensemble pieces and two concertos. Dodgson also composed duet concertos for two guitars and strings, and for violin, guitar and strings. His works for the guitar call on many different instrumental combinations, ranging from two, three and four guitars to use of massed guitars with and without accompaniments. His contribution to the core solo guitar repertoire includes four well-known partitas and a popular set of Fantasy-Divisions.

Dodgson&#x27;s first work for harpsichord, a set of Six Inventions, was written in 1955. Influenced by his wife Jane&#x27;s scholarly and practical interest in the history of the instrument, he produced a further four sets of Inventions for harpsichord, dating from 1961, 1970, 1985 and 1993, a series of 30 pieces that charts a musical course from the early twentieth-century metal-framed instruments to replicas of antique instruments, with the introduction of stylistic features derived from historically informed performance practice.

Dodgson&#x27;s many contributions to the recorder repertoire include &quot;Shine and Shade&quot;, a jazzy virtuoso piece from 1975, written for one of his students, the composer Richard Harvey. Material from Dodgson&#x27;s incidental music for a 1970 BBC Radio production of a John Ford play, &quot;Perkin Warbeck&quot;, in which David Munrow had played the recorder enthusiastically, re-emerged in 1972 in a follow-up work called &quot;Warbeck Dances&quot; for recorder and harpsichord. His later works for the instrument include the &quot;Concerto Chacony&quot; (2000) with string orchestra, and a Capriccio Concertante No. 2 (2005) for the unusual combination of recorder, harpsichord and string orchestra.

Dodgson loved the theatre and wrote both for the stage and for many BBC drama productions (see Incidental music). His one full-scale opera, &quot;Margaret Catchpole – Two Worlds Apart&quot;, is in four acts and features a heroine who has been dubbed a &quot;female Dick Turpin&quot;. His two chamber operas, the farcical &quot;Cadilly&quot; and &quot;Nancy the Waterman&quot;, were first performed with puppets (at the Purcell Room in 1969) and have also been fully staged (in St Albans in 2002 and 2007).

His music for wind band includes a four-movement Wind Symphony (1974). His orchestral output features a set of nine Essays for orchestra (five of which were recorded on a Dutton CD by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra under David Lloyd Jones), each lasting around a quarter of an hour, in which Dodgson says he aimed &quot;to treat the orchestra boldly, as an integrated body and with ideas concentrated and unified more than contrasted&quot;, in keeping with Francis Bacon&#x27;s conception of the essay as &quot;dispersed meditations&quot;. Other commercial recordings of cycles of Dodgson&#x27;s works include the seven piano sonatas played by Bernard Roberts and the eight string quartets performed by the Tippett String Quartet.

==Style==
In &quot;The Oxford Companion to Music&quot;, Paul Griffiths notes that Dodgson &quot;proved adept at producing likable, well-crafted music to order, often for unusual chamber ensembles&quot;. The critic Guy Rickards has summarized his style as follows: &quot;Dodgson&#x27;s music is written mostly in an agreeable if occasionally challenging modern tonal idiom, cosmopolitan rather than overtly British in style, influenced by early and Baroque music and Janáček as much as English pastoralism... His mature style was one of refinement, sitting somewhere between post-Romanticism and neo-classicism, but individual works often had quirky, even spectral sides to them.&quot;

<text>Cilgerran (previously Kilgerran or Cil-Garon) is both a village, a parish, and also a community, situated on the south bank of the River Teifi in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It was formerly an incorporated market town.

Among Cilgerran&#x27;s attractions are Cilgerran Castle and annual coracle races. Kilgerran Halt was a stop on the former Whitland and Cardigan Railway. There are a number of listed buildings, including the parish church.

Nearby are the hamlets of Llwyncelyn, Rhoshill, Cnwce, Pen-y-bryn, Carreg-wen and Pontrhydyceirt, and the villages of Llechryd and Boncath.

Cilgerran Hundred derives its title from the former town, which was once the headquarters of the commote of &quot;Emlyn is Cuch&quot; (Emlyn below the River Cych).

Slate quarrying was an important activity in the 19th century.

==Location==
Cilgerran lies above sea level on the southern bank of the River Teifi. The stream &quot;Afon Plysgog&quot; which rises on nearby Rhoshill runs under the road to the west of Cilgerran to join the Teifi. A mixture of woodland and pasture surrounds the town, which is strung out along a fairly level C-class road in an eastwest orientation connecting with the A484 at Llechryd to the east and the A478 at Pen-y-bryn to the west.

==History==

Cilgerran Castle, strategically built in 1100 at &quot;Cenarth Bychan&quot;, high above the River Teifi, is the castle from which Owain of Powys is said to have abducted Nest in 1109. Originally in Cantref Emlyn (Emlyn Is-Cych), Cilgerran came under Norman control with the building of the castle, from where the Lordship of Cilgerran was administered. The Welsh under the Lord Rhys regained control from 1164-65 (the date of the first recording of the name &quot;Cilgerran&quot;) to 1223. By 1204 the town was beginning to grow, with 22 taxpayers recorded in 1292.

The Hundred of Cilgerran was established in 1536. It was a marcher borough; Owen, Lord of Kemes, described it in 1603 as one of five Pembrokeshire boroughs overseen by a portreeve. Cilgerran (as &quot;Kilgarren&quot;) appears on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. Although the town remained small it was considered one of the main market centres in Pembrokeshire in the early 17th century, with mainly Welsh demographics.

The principal occupations throughout Cilgerran&#x27;s history were farming, salmon fishing and slate quarrying. In 1895 salmon of 38 and 43 1/2lb were caught in coracle nets. The town&#x27;s market ended in the early 20th century, there was no further quarrying after 1936 and the castle had been allowed to become a ruin since the 16th century, partly as a result of nearby quarrying. At least since 1833 Cilgerran has been referred to as a village.

A rare visit by a white stork to the village was photographed in April 2016.

==Worship==

The parish church of St Llawddog is a grade II* listed building. The church&#x27;s tower is mediaeval and the remainder, in decorated Gothic style, dates from 1855. The font and pulpit are carved Bath stone. The churchyard contains a megalithic standing stone or Ogham stone upon which Ogham writing can still be seen.

Penuel Baptist Chapel (a Grade II listed building) is on the main street, while Tyrhos Congregational Chapel (Grade II) is on the road linking Cilgerran and the hamlet of Rhoshill. Babell Calvinist Methodist Chapel dates from about 1763 and closed in 2011.

==Education==
Cilgerran County Primary School educates 139 (in 2013) children from nursery to 11 years old and serves several surrounding villages. Pupils are taught in English and Welsh with the aim of bilingualism by the age of 11.

==Public houses==
The &quot;Cardiff Arms&quot; (19th century) and &quot;Pendre Inn&quot; (18th century or earlier) are both Grade II listed buildings; the &quot;Masons Arms&quot; (known locally as the &quot;Ramp Inn&quot;) is in Cnwce, a settlement to the east of Cilgerran.

==Amenities==
Cilgerran has a post office, a cafe, a garage/petrol station and general stores. In and around the town are a number of small businesses including a pet food store. Rhosygilwen estate, near Rhoshill, is a venue for concerts and exhibitions, attracting international artists and musicians under the banner of Project Rhosygilwen, run by Dr Glen Peters. The estate is home to the first utility-scale solar park in west Wales, constructed in 2011 and generating enough electricity to power 300 homes.

==Transport==
The Whitland and Cardigan Railway closed in 1962; the section of old trackbed between Cardigan and Cilgerran is now a footpath and cycle track to the Teifi estuary woodlands and marshes and the Welsh Wildlife Centre. The only public transport serving Cilgerran is the local bus service.

==Attractions==
With much of Cilgerran Castle in ruins, its picturesque nature and setting have attracted many artists including J. M. W. Turner.

The annual coracle races on the River Teifi were first held in 1950 and attract competitors from all over the world. The river flows slowly through a wooded gorge below the castle making it attractive for canoeists and kayakers.

==Population and governance==
The census population of the parish of Cilgerran was: 854 (1801): 1266 (1851): 1,033 (1901): 815 (1951): 703 (1981). The percentage of Welsh speakers was: 96 (1891): 94 (1931): 78 (1971). The population in 2001 was 1,931, with 53 per cent Welsh speakers, and in 2011 was 1,507. The village has its own elected community council; the community includes Bridell, Llantood and Rhoshill. The electoral ward of Cilgerran covers the communities of Cilgerran and Manordeifi. The ward had a population of 1,453 in 2001, increasing to 2,058 in the 2011 Census.

== Slate quarrying ==
A substantial degree of slate quarrying was carried out in and near Cilgerran, mostly situated on the south side of the River Teifi&#x27;s gorge. They played a significant role in Wales&#x27; slate industry, being the only significant quarries in South Wales apart from those around Rhoshill.

Most slate was transported to the port at Cardigan for export by sea. Some of the slate was used for buildings within the town, or exported directly by railway for use within Britain. Wharves were built east of the town on the River Teifi (at ), where slate could be loaded onto boats to take it to Cardigan.

Slate was first quarried at Cilgerran by John Edwards, in the late 1790s. He opened a quarry north of the town, in the land known as &#x27;Forest&#x27; (near the Caernarfon Farm), called the Lower quarry or Forest quarry – at the site of what became Quarry Caernarvon. Later, with his two sons John and Thomas, Edwards opened another quarry slightly higher up the river, known as the Gigfran quarry (&#x27;Gigfran&#x27; is Welsh for &#x27;Carrion crow&#x27;). Soon afterwards, John Bowen opened the Plain quarries, and around this time the Castle quarries and Moses&#x27; quarry were also opened, by George John and David John, and Moses Griffith, respectively. Upon the death of John Edwards (around 1830), Thomas Lloyd, of Coedmawr, and Oliver Lloyd, of Cardigan, acquired the Lower quarries, and began expanding them on a large scale. However, they sold the quarries soon afterwards, to James Stephens, of Llechryd.

In the late 1830s, another quarry was opened in the &#x27;Forest&#x27; estate, by Mr. James Mathias of Cilgerran. It was called &#x27;Quarry Forever&#x27;, and situated adjacent to Gigfran quarry. About the same time, Gigfran quarry became exhausted and was thus given up. The industry peaked in the late 19th century, its continuance until that time supported by the coming of the railway in 1869.

There were two groups of quarries at Cilgerran – the ones north of the town, known collectively as the Forest quarries, and those to the east of the town, around Cnwcau, sometimes called the Town quarries. The Forest quarries were almost immediately opposite (the other side of the Teifi Gorge from) Rhoshill.

The major quarries were:

<text>Guy of Thouars (died 13 April 1213) was Duke of Brittany from 1199 to 1201 as the third husband of Constance, Duchess of Brittany. They married in Angers, County of Anjou, between August and October 1199 after her son Arthur entered Angers to be recognized as count of the three countships of Anjou, Maine and Touraine. He was an Occitan noble, a member of the House of Thouars. 

Between 1196 and the time of her death in 1201, while delivering twin daughters, Constance ruled Brittany with her young son, Arthur I, as co-ruler. Duke Arthur was captured in 1202 by his uncle John, King of England, and disappeared in 1203. Arthur&#x27;s elder full sister Eleanor, was captured along with him and imprisoned by John. Arthur was succeeded by his infant half-sister, Guy&#x27;s daughter Alix of Thouars. Guy served as regent of Brittany for his daughter from 1203 to 1206.

In 1204, Guy as regent of Duchess Alix, vassal of Philip II of France, undertook the siege of the Norman island fortress of Mont Saint-Michel. Because the abbey would not surrender, he set fire to the village and massacred the population. The fire which he himself lit extended to the buildings, and the roofs were engulfed in flames. Philip II paid Abbot Jordan for the reconstruction cost.

In 1206 Philip II took the regency of Brittany himself, much to the consternation of the Breton nobles.

Guy died in 1213 in Chemillé in the county of Maine, and was buried with Constance at Villeneuve Abbey, now in the commune of Les Sorinières, outside of Nantes. &#x27;Situated at Nantes south gate, Abbey de Villeneuve&#x27; was &#x27;founded in 1201 by Constance de Panthièvre, the Duchess of Brittany ...&#x27;

==Issue==
Guy married Constance of Brittany in 1199. They had two or three daughters:
* Alix of Thouars, succeeded her half-brother in 1203 as &quot;suo jure&quot; Duchess of Brittany and Countess of Richmond;
* Catherine of Thouars, Dame of Aubigné; married Andrew III, Baron of Vitré in 1212;
* Margaret of Thouars.

Guy remarried Eustachie of Chemillé in 1203. They had two sons: 
* Peter, Lord of Chemillé (1204-1254/55), who married Eleanor of Porhoët.
* Thomas of Chémillé (d. c. January 1246).

<doc id="636929" wikidata="Q130995" url="?curid=636929" title="Dromaeosauridae">
<text>Dromaeosauridae () is a family of feathered coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs. They were generally small to medium-sized feathered carnivores that flourished in the Cretaceous Period. The name Dromaeosauridae means &#x27;running lizards&#x27;, from Greek (&#x27;), meaning &#x27;running at full speed&#x27;, &#x27;swift&#x27;, and (&#x27;), meaning &#x27;lizard&#x27;. In informal usage, they are often called raptors (after &quot;Velociraptor&quot;), a term popularized by the film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;; several genera include the term &quot;raptor&quot; directly in their name, and popular culture has come to emphasize their bird-like appearance and speculated bird-like behavior.

Dromaeosaurid fossils have been found across the globe in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and South America, with some fossils giving credence to the possibility that they inhabited Australia as well. The earliest body fossils are known from the Early Cretaceous (145–140 million years ago), and they survived until the end of the Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage, 66 ma), existing until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The presence of dromaeosaurids as early as the Middle Jurassic has been suggested by the discovery of isolated fossil teeth, though no dromaeosaurid body fossils have been found from this period.

==Description==
===Technical diagnosis===
Dromaeosaurids are diagnosed by the following features: short T-shaped frontals that form the rostral boundary of the supratemporal fenestra; a caudolateral overhanging shelf of the squamosal; a lateral process of the quadrate that contacts the quadratojugal; raised, stalked, parapophyses on the dorsal vertebrae, a modified pedal digit II; chevrons and prezygapophysis of the caudal vertebrae elongate and spanning several vertebrae; the presence of a subglenoid fossa on the coracoid.

===Size and general build===

Dromaeosaurids were small to medium-sized dinosaurs, ranging from in length (in the case of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;) to approaching or over (in &quot;Utahraptor&quot;, &quot;Dakotaraptor&quot; and &quot;Achillobator&quot;). Large size appears to have evolved at least twice among dromaeosaurids; once among the dromaeosaurines &quot;Utahraptor&quot; and &quot;Achillobator&quot;, and again among the unenlagiines (&quot;Austroraptor&quot;, which measured long). A possible third lineage of giant dromaeosaurids is represented by isolated teeth found on the Isle of Wight, England. The teeth belong to an animal the size of the dromaeosaurine &quot;Utahraptor&quot;, but they appear to belong to velociraptorines, judging by the shape of the teeth.

The distinctive dromaeosaurid body plan helped to rekindle theories that dinosaurs may have been active, fast, and closely related to birds. Robert Bakker&#x27;s illustration for John Ostrom&#x27;s 1969 monograph, showing the dromaeosaurid &quot;Deinonychus&quot; in a fast run, is among the most influential paleontological reconstructions in history. The dromaeosaurid body plan includes a relatively large skull, serrated teeth, narrow snout (an exception being the derived dromaeosaurines), and forward-facing eyes which indicate some degree of binocular vision.

Dromaeosaurids, like most other theropods, had a moderately long S-curved neck, and their trunk was relatively short and deep. Like other maniraptorans, they had long arms that could be folded against the body in some species, and relatively large hands with three long fingers (the middle finger being the longest and the first finger being the shortest) ending in large claws. The dromaeosaurid hip structure featured a characteristically large pubic boot projecting beneath the base of the tail. Dromaeosaurid feet bore a large, recurved claw on the second toe. Their tails were slender, with long, low, vertebrae lacking transverse process and neural spines after the 14th caudal vertebra. Ossified uncinate processes of ribs have been identified in several dromaeosaurids.

===Foot===

Like other theropods, dromaeosaurids were bipedal; that is, they walked on their hind legs. However, whereas most theropods walked with three toes contacting the ground, fossilized footprint tracks confirm that many early paravian groups, including the dromaeosaurids, held the second toe off the ground in a hyperextended position, with only the third and fourth toes bearing the weight of the animal. This is called functional didactyly. The enlarged second toe bore an unusually large, curved, &quot;falciform&quot; (sickle-shaped, alt. &quot;drepanoid&quot;) claw (held off the ground or &#x27;retracted&#x27; when walking), which is thought to have been used in capturing prey and climbing trees (see &quot;Claw function&quot; below). This claw was especially blade-like in the large-bodied predatory eudromaeosaurs. One possible dromaeosaurid species, &quot;Balaur bondoc&quot;, also possessed a first toe which was highly modified in parallel with the second. Both the first and second toes on each foot of &quot;B. bondoc&quot; were also held retracted and bore enlarged, sickle-shaped claws.

===Tail===

Dromaeosaurids had long tails. Most of the tail vertebrae bore bony, rod-like extensions (called prezygapophyses), as well as bony tendons in some species. In his study of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, Ostrom proposed that these features stiffened the tail so that it could only flex at the base, and the whole tail would then move as a single, rigid, lever. However, one well-preserved specimen of &quot;Velociraptor mongoliensis&quot; (IGM 100/986) has an articulated tail skeleton that is curved horizontally in a long S-shape. This suggests that, in life, the tail could bend from side to side with a substantial degree of flexibility. It has been proposed that this tail was used as a stabilizer or counterweight while running or in the air; in &quot;Microraptor&quot;, an elongate diamond-shaped fan of feathers is preserved on the end of the tail. This may have been used as an aerodynamic stabilizer and rudder during gliding or powered flight (see &quot;Flight and gliding&quot; below).

===Feathers===
There is a large body of evidence showing that dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers. Some dromaeosaurid fossils preserve long, pennaceous feathers on the hands and arms (&quot;remiges&quot;) and tail (&quot;rectrices&quot;), as well as shorter, down-like feathers covering the body. Other fossils, which do not preserve actual impressions of feathers, still preserve the associated bumps on the forearm bones where long wing feathers would have attached in life. Overall, this feather pattern looks very much like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;.

The first known dromaeosaurid with definitive evidence of feathers was &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot;, reported from China by Xu &quot;et al.&quot; in 1999. Many other dromaeosaurid fossils have been found with feathers covering their bodies, some with fully developed feathered wings. &quot;Microraptor&quot; even shows evidence of a second pair of wings on the hind legs. While direct feather impressions are only possible in fine-grained sediments, some fossils found in coarser rocks show evidence of feathers by the presence of quill knobs, the attachment points for wing feathers possessed by some birds. The dromaeosaurids &quot;Rahonavis&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot; have both been found with quill knobs, showing that these forms had feathers despite no impressions having been found. In light of this, it is most likely that even the larger ground-dwelling dromaeosaurids bore feathers, since even flightless birds today retain most of their plumage, and relatively large dromaeosaurids, like &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, are known to have retained pennaceous feathers. Though some scientists had suggested that the larger dromaeosaurids lost some or all of their insulatory covering, the discovery of feathers in &quot;Velociraptor&quot; specimens has been cited as evidence that all members of the family retained feathers.

More recently, the discovery of &quot;Zhenyuanlong&quot; established the presence of a full feathered coat in relatively large dromaeosaurids. Additionally, the animal displays proportionally large, aerodynamic wing feathers, as well as a tail-spanning fan, both of which are unexpected traits that may offer an understanding of the integument of large dromaeosaurids. &quot;Dakotaraptor&quot; is an even larger dromaeosaurid species with evidence of feathers, albeit indirect in the form of quill knobs, though the taxon is considered as chimeara by other researchers as even the dinosaurian elements with supposed traits diagnostic for dromaeosaurs also referrable to caenagnathids and ornithomimosaurians.

==Classification==
===Relationship with birds===
Dromaeosaurids share many features with early birds (clade Avialae or Aves). The precise nature of their relationship to birds has undergone a great deal of study, and hypotheses about that relationship have changed as large amounts of new evidence became available. As late as 2001, Mark Norell and colleagues analyzed a large survey of coelurosaur fossils and produced the tentative result that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to birds, with troodontids as a more distant outgroup. They even suggested that Dromaeosauridae could be paraphyletic relative to Avialae. In 2002, Hwang and colleagues utilized the work of Norell &quot;et al.&quot;, including new characters and better fossil evidence, to determine that birds (avialans) were better thought of as cousins to the dromaeosaurids and troodontids. The consensus of paleontologists is that there is not yet enough evidence to determine whether any dromaeosaurids could fly or glide, or whether they evolved from ancestors that could.

===Alternative theories and flightlessness===
Dromaeosaurids are so bird-like that they have led some researchers to argue that they would be better classified as birds. First, since they had feathers, dromaeosaurids (along with many other coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs) are &quot;birds&quot; under traditional definitions of the word &quot;bird&quot;, or &quot;Aves&quot;, that are based on the possession of feathers. However, other scientists, such as Lawrence Witmer, have argued that calling a theropod like &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; a bird because it has feathers may stretch the word past any useful meaning.

At least two schools of researchers have proposed that dromaeosaurids may actually be descended from flying ancestors. Hypotheses involving a flying ancestor for dromaeosaurids are sometimes called &quot;Birds Came First&quot; (BCF). George Olshevsky is usually credited as the first author of BCF. In his own work, Gregory S. Paul pointed out numerous features of the dromaeosaurid skeleton that he interpreted as evidence that the entire group had evolved from flying, dinosaurian ancestors, perhaps an animal like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. In that case, the larger dromaeosaurids were secondarily flightless, like the modern ostrich. In 1988, Paul suggested that dromaeosaurids may actually be more closely related to modern birds than to &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. By 2002, however, Paul placed dromaeosaurids and &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; as the closest relatives to one another.

In 2002, Hwang &quot;et al.&quot; found that &quot;Microraptor&quot; was the most primitive dromaeosaurid. Xu and colleagues in 2003 cited the basal position of &quot;Microraptor&quot;, along with feather and wing features, as evidence that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could glide. In that case the larger dromaeosaurids would be secondarily terrestrial—having lost the ability to glide later in their evolutionary history.

Also in 2002, Steven Czerkas described &quot;Cryptovolans&quot;, though it is a probable junior synonym of &quot;Microraptor&quot;. He reconstructed the fossil inaccurately with only two wings and thus argued that dromaeosaurids were powered fliers, rather than passive gliders. He later issued a revised reconstruction in agreement with that of &quot;Microraptor&quot;

Other researchers, like Larry Martin, have proposed that dromaeosaurids, along with all maniraptorans, were not dinosaurs at all. Martin asserted for decades that birds were unrelated to maniraptorans, but in 2004 he changed his position, agreeing that the two were close relatives. However, Martin believed that maniraptorans were secondarily flightless birds, and that birds did not evolve from dinosaurs, but rather from non-dinosaurian archosaurs.

In 2005, Mayr and Peters described the anatomy of a very well preserved specimen of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, and determined that its anatomy was more like non-avian theropods than previously understood. Specifically, they found that &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; had a primitive palatine, unreversed hallux, and hyper-extendable second toe. Their phylogenetic analysis produced the controversial result that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was closer to &quot;Microraptor&quot; than to &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, making the Avialae a paraphyletic taxon. They also suggested that the ancestral paravian was able to fly or glide, and that the dromaeosaurids and troodontids were secondarily flightless (or had lost the ability to glide). Corfe and Butler criticized this work on methodological grounds.

A challenge to all of these alternative scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, &quot;Mahakala&quot;, which they found to be the most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae, more primitive than &quot;Microraptor&quot;. &quot;Mahakala&quot; had short arms and no ability to glide. Turner &quot;et al.&quot; also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, and these two points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, &quot;Mahakala&quot; suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent dromaeosaurid finds recovered the &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;-like &quot;Xiaotingia&quot; as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.

===Taxonomy===
The authorship of the family Dromaeosauridae is credited to William Diller Matthew and Barnum Brown, who erected it as a subfamily (Dromaeosaurinae) of the family Deinodontidae in 1922, containing only the new genus &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot;.

The subfamilies of Dromaeosauridae frequently shift in content based on new analysis, but typically consist of the following groups. A number of dromaeosaurids have not been assigned to any particular subfamily, often because they are too poorly preserved to be placed confidently in phylogenetic analysis (see section &quot;Phylogeny&quot; below) or are indeterminate, being assigned to different groups depending on the methodology employed in different papers. The most basal known subfamily of dromaeosaurids is Halszkaraptorinae, a group of bizarre creatures with long fingers and necks, a large number of small teeth, and possible semiaquatic habits. Another enigmatic group, Unenlagiinae, is the most poorly supported subfamily of dromaeosaurids and it is possible that some or all of its members belong outside of Dromaeosauridae. The larger, ground-dwelling members like &quot;Buitreraptor&quot; and &quot;Unenlagia&quot; show strong flight adaptations, although they were probably too large to &#x27;take off&#x27;. One possible member of this group, &quot;Rahonavis&quot;, is very small, with well-developed wings that show evidence of quill knobs (the attachment points for flight feathers) and it is very likely that it could fly. The next most primitive clade of dromaeosaurids is the Microraptoria. This group includes many of the smallest dromaeosaurids, which show adaptations for living in trees. All known dromaeosaurid skin impressions hail from this group and all show an extensive covering of feathers and well-developed wings. Like the unenlagiines, some species may have been capable of active flight. The most advanced subgroup of dromaeosaurids, Eudromaeosauria, includes stocky and short-legged genera which were likely ambush hunters. This group includes Velociraptorinae, Dromaeosaurinae, and in some studies a third group: Saurornitholestinae. The subfamily Velociraptorinae has traditionally included &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, and &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot;, and while the discovery of &quot;Tsaagan&quot; lent support to this grouping, the inclusion of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, &quot;Saurornitholestes,&quot; and a few other genera is still uncertain. The Dromaeosaurinae is usually found to consist of medium to giant-sized species, with generally box-shaped skulls (the other subfamilies generally have narrower snouts).

The following classification of the various genera of dromaeosaurids follows the table provided in Holtz, 2011 unless otherwise noted.

===Phylogeny===
Dromaeosauridae was first defined as a clade by Paul Sereno in 1998, as the most inclusive natural group containing &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; but not &quot;Troodon&quot;, &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; or &quot;Passer&quot;. The various &quot;subfamilies&quot; have also been re-defined as clades, usually defined as all species closer to the groups namesake than to &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; or any namesakes of other sub-clades (for example, Makovicky defined the clade Unenlagiinae as all dromaeosaurids closer to &quot;Unenlagia&quot; than to &quot;Velociraptor&quot;). The Microraptoria is the only dromaeosaurid sub-clade not converted from a subfamily. Senter and colleagues expressly coined the name without the subfamily suffix &quot;-inae&quot; to avoid perceived issues with erecting a traditional family-group taxon, should the group be found to lie outside dromaeosauridae proper. Sereno offered a revised definition of the sub-group containing &quot;Microraptor&quot; to ensure that it would fall within Dromaeosauridae, and erected the subfamily Microraptorinae, attributing it to Senter &quot;et al.&quot;, though this usage has only appeared on his online TaxonSearch database and has not been formally published. The extensive cladistic analysis conducted by Turner &quot;et al.&quot; (2012) further supported the monophyly of Dromaeosauridae.

==Paleobiology==
===Senses===
Comparisons between the scleral rings of several dromaeosaurids (&quot;Microraptor&quot;, &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Velociraptor&quot;) and modern birds and reptiles indicate that some dromaeosaurids (including &quot;Microraptor&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot;) may have been nocturnal predators, while &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot; is inferred to be cathemeral (active throughout the day at short intervals). However, the discovery of iridescent plumage in &quot;Microraptor&quot; has cast doubt on the inference of nocturnality in this genus, as no modern birds that have iridescent plumage are known to be nocturnal.

Studies of the olfactory bulbs of dromaeosaurids reveal that they had similar olfactory ratios for their size to other non-avian theropods and modern birds with an acute sense of smell, such as tyrannosaurids and the turkey vulture, probably reflecting the importance of the olfactory sense in the daily activities of dromaeosaurids such as finding food.

===Feeding=== 
Dromaeosaurid feeding was discovered to be typical of coelurosaurian theropods, with a characteristic &quot;puncture and pull&quot; feeding method. Studies of wear patterns on the teeth of dromaeosaurids by Angelica Torices &quot;et al.&quot; indicate that dromaeosaurid teeth share similar wear patterns to those seen in the Tyrannosauridae and Troodontidae. However, microwear on the teeth indicated that dromaeosaurids likely preferred larger prey items than the troodontids they often shared their environment with. Such dietary differentiations likely allowed them to inhabit the same environment. The same study also indicated that dromaeosaurids such as &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; and &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot; (two dromaeosaurids analyzed in the study) likely included bone in their diet and were better adapted to handle struggling prey while troodontids, equipped with weaker jaws, preyed on softer animals and prey items such as invertebrates and carrion.

===Claw function===

There is currently disagreement about the function of the enlarged &quot;sickle claw&quot; on the second toe. When John Ostrom described it for &quot;Deinonychus&quot; in 1969, he interpreted the claw as a blade-like slashing weapon, much like the canines of some saber-toothed cats, used with powerful kicks to cut into prey. Adams (1987) suggested that the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. The interpretation of the sickle claw as a killing weapon applied to all dromaeosaurids. However, Manning &quot;et al.&quot; argued that the claw instead served as a hook, reconstructing the keratinous sheath with an elliptical cross section, instead of the previously inferred inverted teardrop shape. In Manning&#x27;s interpretation, the second toe claw would be used as a climbing aid when subduing bigger prey and also as a stabbing weapon.

Ostrom compared &quot;Deinonychus&quot; to the ostrich and cassowary. He noted that the bird species can inflict serious injury with the large claw on the second toe. The cassowary has claws up to long. Ostrom cited Gilliard (1958) in saying that they can sever an arm or disembowel a man. Kofron (1999 and 2003) studied 241 documented cassowary attacks and found that one human and two dogs had been killed, but no evidence that cassowaries can disembowel or dismember other animals. Cassowaries use their claws to defend themselves, to attack threatening animals, and in agonistic displays such as the Bowed Threat Display. The seriema also has an enlarged second toe claw, and uses it to tear apart small prey items for swallowing.

Phillip Manning and colleagues (2009) attempted to test the function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs. They analyzed the bio-mechanics of how stresses and strains would be distributed along the claws and into the limbs, using X-ray imaging to create a three-dimensional contour map of a forelimb claw from &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. For comparison, they analyzed the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and gripping instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly. The Manning team also compared the curvature of the dromaeosaurid &quot;sickle claw&quot; on the foot with curvature in modern birds and mammals. Previous studies had shown that the amount of curvature in a claw corresponded to what lifestyle the animal has: animals with strongly curved claws of a certain shape tend to be climbers, while straighter claws indicate ground-dwelling lifestyles. The sickle claws of the dromaeosaurid &quot;Deinonychus&quot; have a curvature of 160 degrees, well within the range of climbing animals. The forelimb claws they studied also fell within the climbing range of curvature.

Paleontologist Peter Mackovicky commented on the Manning team&#x27;s study, stating that small, primitive dromaeosaurids (such as &quot;Microraptor&quot;) were likely to have been tree-climbers, but that climbing did not explain why later, gigantic dromaeosaurids such as &quot;Achillobator&quot; retained highly curved claws when they were too large to have climbed trees. Mackovicky speculated that giant dromaeosaurids may have adapted the claw to be used exclusively for latching on to prey.

In 2009 Phil Senter published a study on dromaeosaurid toes and showed that their range of motion was compatible with the excavation of tough insect nests. Senter suggested that small dromaeosaurids such as &quot;Rahonavis&quot; and &quot;Buitreraptor&quot; were small enough to be partial insectivores, while larger genera such as &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and &quot;Neuquenraptor&quot; could have used this ability to catch vertebrate prey residing in insect nests. However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.

In 2011, Denver Fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which dromaeosaurids may have taken smaller prey. This model, known as the &quot;raptor prey restraint&quot; (RPR) model of predation, proposes that dromaeosaurids killed their prey in a manner very similar to extant accipitrid birds of prey: by leaping onto their quarry, pinning it under their body weight, and gripping it tightly with the large, sickle-shaped claws. Like accipitrids, the dromaeosaurid would then begin to feed on the animal while still alive, until it eventually died from blood loss and organ failure. This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurids to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors. Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurids most closely resemble those of eagles and hawks, especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion. The short metatarsus and foot strength, however, would have been more similar to that of owls. The RPR method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of dromaeosaurid anatomy, such as their unusual dentition and arm morphology. The arms, which could exert a lot of force but were likely covered in long feathers, may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop a struggling prey animal, along with the stiff counterbalancing tail. Dromaeosaurid jaws, thought by Fowler and colleagues to be comparatively weak, would have been useful for eating prey alive but not as useful for quick, forceful dispatch of the prey. These predatory adaptations working together may also have implications for the origin of flapping in paravians.

In 2019, Peter Bishop reconstructed the leg skeleton and musculature of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; by using three-dimensional models of muscles, tendons, and bones. With the addition of mathematical models and equations, Bishop simulated the conditions that would provide maximum force at the tip of the sickle claw and therefore the most likely function. Among the proposed modes of the sickle claw use are: kicking to cut, slash or disembowel prey; for gripping onto the flanks of prey; piercing aided by body weight; to attack vital areas of the prey; to restrain prey; intra- or interspecific competition; and digging out prey from hideouts. The results obtained by Bishop showed that a crouching posture increased the claw forces, however, these forces remained relatively weak indicating that the claws were not strong enough to be used in slashing strikes. Rather than being used for slashing, the sickle claws were more likely to be useful in flexed leg angles such as restraining prey and stabbing prey at close quarters. These results are consistent with the Fighting Dinosaurs specimen, which preserves a &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops&quot; locked in combat, with the former gripping onto the other with its claws in a non-extended leg posture. Despite the obtained results, Bishop considered that the capabilities of the sickle claw could have varied within taxa given that among dromaeosaurids, &quot;Adasaurus&quot; had an unusually smaller sickle claw that retained the characteristic ginglymoid—a structure divided in two parts—and hyperextensible articular surface of the penultimate phalange. He could neither confirm nor disregard that the pedal digit II could have loss or retain its functionally.

A 2020 study by Gianechini &quot;et al&quot;., also indicates that velociraptorines, dromaeosaurines and other eudromaeosaurs in Laurasia differed greatly in their locomotive and killing techniques from the unenlagiine dromaeosaurids of Gondwana. The shorter second phalanx in the second digit of the foot allowed for increased force to be generated by that digit, which, combined with a shorter and wider metatarsus, and a noticeable marked hinge‐like morphology of the articular surfaces of metatarsals and phalanges, possibly allowed eudromaeosaurs to exert a greater gripping strength than unenlagiines, allowing for more efficient subduing and killing of large prey. In comparison, the unenlagiine dromaeosaurids had a longer and slender subarctometatarsus, and less well‐marked hinge joints, a trait that possibly gave them greater cursorial capacities and allowed for greater speed. Additionally, the longer second phalanx of the second digit allowed unenlagiines fast movements of their feet&#x27;s second digits to hunt smaller and more elusive types of prey. These differences in locomotor and predatory specializations may have been a key feature that influenced the evolutionary pathways that shaped both groups of dromaeosaurs in the northern and southern hemispheres.

===Group behavior===

&quot;Deinonychus&quot; fossils have been uncovered in small groups near the remains of the herbivore &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot;, a larger ornithischian dinosaur. This had been interpreted as evidence that these dromaeosaurids hunted in coordinated packs like some modern mammals. However, not all paleontologists found the evidence conclusive, and a subsequent study published in 2007 by Roach and Brinkman suggests that the &quot;Deinonychus&quot; may have actually displayed a disorganized mobbing behavior. Modern diapsids, including birds and crocodiles (the closest relatives of dromaeosaurids), display minimal long-term cooperative hunting (except the aplomado falcon and Harris&#x27;s hawk); instead, they are usually solitary hunters, either joining forces time to time to increase hunting success (as crocodilians sometimes do), or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where conflict often occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and might attack smaller Komodo dragons that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal dies, it is usually cannibalized. When this information is applied to the sites containing putative pack-hunting behavior in dromaeosaurids, it appears somewhat consistent with a Komodo dragon-like feeding strategy. &quot;Deinonychus&quot; skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts that may have been eaten by other &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, which a study by Roach &quot;et al.&quot; presented as evidence against the idea that the animals cooperated in the hunt. A 2020 study done by Frederickson and colleagues found the dietary preferences between juvenile and adult &quot;Deinonychus&quot; to be different. Suggesting that parental feeding ended before the young were large enough to sustain a typical adult diet. This would indicate that the genus did not exhibit mammal-like pack hunting. Despite this, they considered gregariousness to be possible in &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. The Komodo dragon lifestyle was also criticized, due to the lack of spatial distribution of juveniles and adults, suggesting a reduced cannibalistic lifestyle. 

In 2001, multiple &quot;Utahraptor&quot; specimens ranging in age from fully grown adult to tiny three-foot-long baby were found at a site considered by some to be a quicksand predator trap. Some consider this as evidence of family hunting behaviour; however, the full sandstone block is yet to be opened and researchers are unsure as to whether or not the animals died at the same time. Frederickson and colleagues suggests this was a possible sign of gregariousness in &quot;Utahraptor&quot; and dromaeosaurids exhibiting post nestling care.

In 2007, scientists described the first known extensive dromaeosaurid trackway, in Shandong, China. In addition to confirming the hypothesis that the sickle claw was held retracted off the ground, the trackway (made by a large, &quot;Achillobator&quot;-sized species) showed evidence of six individuals of about equal size moving together along a shoreline. The individuals were spaced about one meter apart, traveling in the same direction and walking at a fairly slow pace. The authors of the paper describing these footprints interpreted the trackways as evidence that some species of dromaeosaurids lived in groups. While the trackways clearly do not represent hunting behavior, the idea that groups of dromaeosaurids may have hunted together, according to the authors, could not be ruled out.

===Flying and gliding===

The forearms of dromaeosaurids appear well adapted to resisting the torsional and bending stresses associated with flapping and gliding, and the ability to fly or glide has been suggested for at least five dromaeosaurid species. The first, &quot;Rahonavis ostromi&quot; (originally classified as avian bird, but found to be a dromaeosaurid in later studies) may have been capable of powered flight, as indicated by its long forelimbs with evidence of quill knob attachments for long sturdy flight feathers. The forelimbs of &quot;Rahonavis&quot; were more powerfully built than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, and show evidence that they bore strong ligament attachments necessary for flapping flight. Luis Chiappe concluded that, given these adaptations, &quot;Rahonavis&quot; could probably fly but would have been more clumsy in the air than modern birds.

Another species of dromaeosaurid, &quot;Microraptor gui&quot;, may have been capable of gliding using its well-developed wings on both the fore and hind limbs. A 2005 study by Sankar Chatterjee suggested that the wings of &quot;Microraptor&quot; functioned like a split-level &quot;biplane&quot;, and that it likely employed a &quot;phugoid&quot; style of gliding, in which it would launch from a perch and swoop downward in a U-shaped curve, then lift again to land on another tree, with the tail and hind wings helping to control its position and speed. Chatterjee also found that &quot;Microraptor&quot; had the basic requirements to sustain level powered flight in addition to gliding.

&quot;Changyuraptor yangi&quot; is a close relative of &quot;Microraptor gui&quot;, also thought to be a glider or flyer based on the presence of four wings and similar limb proportions. However, it is a considerably larger animal, around the size of a wild turkey, being among the largest known flying Mesozoic paravians.

Another dromaeosaurid species, &quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus&quot;, may display partial flight capacities. The young of this species bore longer arms and more robust pectoral girdles than adults, and which were similar to those seen in other flapping theropods, implying that they may have been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.

The possibility that &quot;Sinornithosaurus millenii&quot; was capable of gliding or even powered flight has also been brought up several times, though no further studies have occurred.

&quot;Zhenyuanlong&quot; preserves wing feathers that are aerodynamically shaped, with particularly bird-like coverts as opposed to the longer, wider-spanning coverts of forms like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and &quot;Anchiornis&quot;, as well as fused sternal plates. Due to its size and short arms it is unlikely that &quot;Zhenyuanlong&quot; was capable of powered flight (though the importance of biomechanical modelling in this regard is stressed), but it may suggest a relatively close descendance from flying ancestors, or even some capacity for gliding or wing-assisted incline running.

===Paleopathology===
In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. The researchers found lesions like those caused by stress fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, one of only two such claw lesions discovered in the course of the study. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since stress fractures in the feet can be obtained while running or during migration. Hand injuries, by contrast, are more likely to be obtained while in contact with struggling prey.

===Swimming===

At least one dromaeosaurid group, Halszkaraptorinae, whose members are halszkaraptorines, are most likely to have been specialised for aquatic or semiaquatic habits, having developed limb proportions, tooth morphology, and rib cage akin to those of diving birds.

Fishing habits have been proposed for unenlagiines, including comparisons to attributed semi-aquatic spinosaurids, but any aquatic propulsion mechanisms have not been discussed so far.

===Reproduction===

In 2006, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky reported an egg associated with a specimen of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. The egg shares similarities with oviraptorid eggs, and the authors interpreted the association as potentially indicative of brooding. A study published in November 2018 by Norell, Yang and Wiemann et al., indicates that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; laid blue eggs, likely to camouflage them as well as creating open nests. Other dromaeosaurids may have done the same, and it is theorized that they and other maniraptoran dinosaurs may have been an origin point for laying colored eggs and creating open nests as many birds do today.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Velociraptor&quot;, a dromaeosaurid, gained much attention after it was featured prominently in the 1993 Steven Spielberg film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. However, the dimensions of the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; in the film are much larger than the largest members of that genus. Robert Bakker recalled that Spielberg had been disappointed with the dimensions of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and so upsized it. Gregory S. Paul, in his 1988 book &quot;Predatory Dinosaurs of the World&quot;, also considered &quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus&quot; a species of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, and so rechristened the species &quot;Velociraptor antirrhopus&quot;. This taxonomic opinion has not been widely followed.

<doc id="636931" wikidata="Q2513293" url="?curid=636931" title="Esther Rantzen">
<text>Dame Esther Louise Rantzen (born 22 June 1940) is an English journalist and television presenter who presented the BBC television series &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; for 21 years, from 1973 until 1994. She works with various charitable causes and founded the charities Childline, a helpline for children, which she set up in 1986, and The Silver Line, designed to combat loneliness in older people&#x27;s lives, which she set up in November 2012.

Rantzen has been recognised for her contribution to television and society. She was awarded an OBE for services to broadcasting in 1991 and a CBE for services to children in 2006, and in the 2015 New Year Honours was made a Dame for services to children and older people through Childline and The Silver Line. She is patron for a number of charities, including the charity Operation Encompass, and is a trustee for the charity Silver Stories.

==Early life and family==
Rantzen was born in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, England, to Katherine Flora Rantzen (&quot;née&quot; Leverson, 1911–2005) and Henry Barnato Rantzen (1902–1992), an electrical engineer. Her family is Jewish. She has one younger sister, Priscilla N. Taylor. She attended Buckley Country Day School in New York, leaving in 1950. She was educated at North London Collegiate School, an all-girls independent school in Edgware, North London. She studied English at Somerville College, Oxford, where the Principal was Dame Janet Vaughan and one of her tutors was Mary Lascelles. At Oxford she performed with the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), became Secretary of the Experimental Theatre Club (ETC) and joined the Oxford Theatre Group, performing in Oxford and Edinburgh.

Rantzen was the subject of an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; on 3 September 2008 (series 5 episode 4). Her paternal line was traced back, as far as the 1760s, to an established Jewish neighbourhood in Warsaw. Tracing Rantzen&#x27;s forebears was greatly helped by the rarity of the surname &quot;Rantzen&quot; (even in Warsaw) and the survival of records in Warsaw. In the late 1850s, her great-great-grandfather emigrated to Britain and settled, as a cap-maker, in Spitalfields, a slum district of London&#x27;s East End. Rantzen&#x27;s great-grandfather moved to a more comfortable neighbourhood with the help of his brother-in-law, Barney Barnato (born Barnett Isaacs), who had become extremely wealthy as the owner of the Kimberley Diamond Mine in South Africa. Her father&#x27;s middle name was Barnato. On her wealthy maternal side, Rantzen&#x27;s great-grandfather, Montague Leverson, was one of the founders of the West London Synagogue. Montague Leverson was the maternal grandfather of British composer Gerald Finzi. Rantzen is also related to Ada Leverson, a British writer and friend of Oscar Wilde, who was portrayed by Zoë Wanamaker in the 1997 film &quot;Wilde&quot;. She is first cousin once removed of the novelist and translator Michael Meyer.

==Career==
===BBC===
After training in secretarial skills, Rantzen was recruited by BBC Radio as a trainee sound effects assistant. She began her television career as a clerk in the programme planning department, then obtained her first production job working as a researcher on the BBC1 late-night satire programme &quot;BBC-3&quot; (1965–66). Having worked as a researcher on a number of current affairs programmes, she moved to the award-winning BBC2 documentary series &quot;Man Alive&quot; in the mid-1960s.

In 1968, Rantzen, at the time a researcher for &quot;Braden&#x27;s Week&quot; (hosted by Bernard Braden), became a presenter because the producer of the programme decided to put the researchers onscreen. Braden decided to return to his native Canada in 1972, to present a similar TV show there; the following year, the BBC replaced &quot;Braden&#x27;s Week&quot; with &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; with Rantzen as the main presenter.

&quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; ran on BBC1 for 21 years from 1973 to 1994, becoming one of the most popular shows on British television, reaching audiences of more than 18 million. During that time, it expanded the traditional role of the consumer programme from simply exposing faulty washing machines and dodgy salesmen, to investigating life-and-death issues, such as a campaign for more organ donors, which featured Ben Hardwick, a two-year-old dying of liver disease whose only hope was a transplant. Also included was the investigation of Crookham Court boarding school near Newbury, described as &quot;dirty and depressing&quot; with unsatisfactory teaching standards, the headmaster of which was a paedophile who employed several paedophile teachers. The school was closed and the head and a member of staff were convicted of sexual offences against pupils as a result of &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; publicising the issues.

To lighten some of these very serious themes and issues, &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; also had some humorous spots, such as readings of amusing misprints sent in by viewers; it also featured comic songs that often matched the theme of each show, specially written and performed by artists such as Lynsey de Paul, Victoria Wood, Richard Stilgoe and Jake Thackray.

In 1976, Rantzen devised the documentary series &quot;The Big Time&quot;, which launched Sheena Easton&#x27;s singing career.

===Childline===

&quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; was influential in many different ways, not least in the introduction of the videolink for child witnesses in court procedures, and it was responsible for the launch of Childline in 1986, the first national helpline for children in danger or distress. Rantzen had suggested the &quot;Childwatch&quot; programme to BBC1 Controller Michael Grade after the death of a toddler who had starved to death, locked in a bedroom. The aim of the programme was to find better ways of detecting children at risk of abuse; to that end, viewers of &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; who had themselves experienced cruelty as children were asked to take part in a survey detailing the circumstances of their abuse.

Rantzen suggested that after that edition of &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;, the BBC should open a helpline for children, in case any young viewers suffering current abuse wished to ring in to ask for help. The helpline was open for 48 hours, during which it was swamped with calls, mainly from children suffering sexual abuse they had never been able to disclose to anyone else. This gave Rantzen the idea for a specific helpline for children in distress or danger, to be open 24/7 throughout the year, the first of its kind in the world. The &quot;Childwatch&quot; team consulted child care professionals, who agreed that children would use such a helpline, but said it would be impossible to create. Nevertheless, the team obtained funding from the Department of Health and the Variety Club of Great Britain, both of which donated £25,000. Ian Skipper OBE, a noted philanthropist who had already helped Rantzen set up a special fund in memory of Ben Hardwick, agreed to underwrite the helpline&#x27;s running costs for the first year. Rantzen and the team went to BT to ask for premises for the charity and for a simple freephone number, both of which were provided.

The &quot;Childwatch&quot; programme screened on 30 October 1986 and, based on the results of the survey, launched Childline with a specially written jingle (by B. A. Robertson) which featured the free phone number 0800 1111. On that first night in October 1986, fifty thousand attempted calls were made to the helpline. Childline now has twelve bases around the UK, including two in Northern Ireland, two in Scotland and two in Wales, plus a virtual on-line base. Childline merged with the NSPCC in 2006, enabling it to expand in an effort to meet demand. The helpline has now been copied in 150 countries.

===The Silver Line===

In 2013, Rantzen set up The Silver Line, a charity to benefit elderly people, by combating isolation and loneliness, to provide information and advice and to offer a free confidential helpline. In addition, The Silver Line offers a telephone befriending service, in which trained volunteers make regular weekly calls to older people. It also offers conference calls, discussion groups originally called Silver Circles. It has now merged with AgeUK.

===Later career===

In 1988, Rantzen created a BBC One television series called &quot;Hearts of Gold&quot;, celebrating people who had performed unsung acts of outstanding kindness or courage that became a prime time ratings hit Its theme tune was written by her close friend Lynsey de Paul, and was released as a single on the CBS record label. 

After &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; finished its 21-year run in 1994, she presented her own talk show, &quot;Esther&quot;, on BBC Two from 1994 to 2002. In 2004, Rantzen was a contestant on the second series of the BBC celebrity dance competition &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. She was paired with Anton Du Beke, and they were the third couple to be eliminated.

In 2006, Rantzen took part in the BBC Two programmes &quot;Would Like to Meet&quot; and &quot;Excuse My French&quot;, and was selected to present a new consumer affairs show with former &quot;Watchdog&quot; presenter Lynn Faulds Wood, under the title &quot;Old Dogs New Tricks&quot;. She made a documentary for ITV called &quot;Winton&#x27;s Children&quot; about Sir Nicholas Winton, who (as was first revealed on &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;) had rescued a generation of Czech children from The Holocaust and was later nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Following the death of Rantzen&#x27;s husband, film-maker Desmond Wilcox, she made a landmark programme on palliative care, &quot;How to Have a Good Death&quot;, for BBC Two. She has campaigned on behalf of hospice care and better care for the elderly and terminally ill, and has also campaigned to raise awareness of ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), as her elder daughter has suffered from the condition. She created the &#x27;Children of Courage&#x27; segment for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children in Need&quot; programme, and the series &quot;The Big Time&quot; which discovered singer Sheena Easton.

Rantzen was for a time a director of That&#x27;s Media, which provides local TV programmes. In 2016, she was made an Honorary Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford.

In addition to her television career, as a patron or vice-president of 55 charities, she mainly concentrates on working for children, vulnerable older people and disabled people. Much of her voluntary effort has been for Childline as a volunteer counsellor on the helpline, and as a fund-raiser and spokesperson for children, and latterly working to set up The Silver Line, the new helpline for isolated and vulnerable older people. Childline currently has 12 centres around the UK, plus one virtual on-line base,1,500 volunteer counsellors and answers around a million calls and on-line contacts from children each year. Rantzen chaired Childline&#x27;s board of trustees for twenty years, and since Childline merged with the NSPCC in 2006, she served as a Trustee of the NSPCC, as well as being President of Childline. In 2013, she also became the vice-president of Revitalise, a charity providing those with disabilities, and their carers, with short breaks and holidays. Rantzen is also patron of Erosh, a national charity which promotes good quality sheltered and retirement housing and provides resources for its members who support older people.

Rantzen appeared in the 2008 series of ITV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, and was the fifth celebrity to leave the camp.

In 2016, she was in the first episode of &quot;Celebrity First Dates&quot;.

In 2018, she presented a new Channel 5 consumer advice show called &quot;Esther Rantzen’s House Trap&quot;, a 4-part series similar to BBC&#x27;s long-running &quot;Watchdog&quot; programme, with hidden cameras trying to trap rogue traders in the homes of a number of undercover actors. Unlike &quot;Watchdog&quot;, these actors were all people of an advanced age with each episode focusing on a different trade, such as locksmiths, where older people were likely to being preyed upon.

===Political career===
On 26 May 2009, on Stephen Rhodes&#x27;s BBC Three Counties Breakfast Show, Rantzen announced her intention to stand as an independent candidate for Parliament, if the incumbent Labour MP Margaret Moran stood for Luton South again. This statement was made against the backdrop of the Parliamentary expenses scandal and Moran&#x27;s expense claims for £23,000 to eliminate dry rot in her second home in Southampton. Two days later, Moran announced she would not stand at the next general election, but Rantzen said she was still considering standing herself and confirmed her candidacy on 28 July 2009. Rantzen stood for election in Luton South against eleven other candidates, of whom four were independent. At the May 2010 election, Rantzen came fourth with 4.4% of the vote, behind the three main parties. In accordance with UK parliamentary electoral process, Rantzen lost her deposit, as only candidates receiving over 5% of the total votes cast have their deposit returned. Labour Party candidate Gavin Shuker won the seat with 34.9% of the vote, the Conservatives got 29.4% and the Liberal Democrats 22.7%.

In August 2014, Rantzen was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote against independence from the United Kingdom in the referendum on that issue.

=== Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal===

In &quot;&quot;, broadcast on 3 October 2012, Rantzen, after seeing the interviews the programme contains, supported the women abused by the BBC broadcaster Jimmy Savile.

She told &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;: &quot;If anybody had had concrete evidence, I think and hope the police would have been called in. But all they had was gossip – and gossip isn&#x27;t evidence.&quot;

Abuse campaigner Shy Keenan, writing in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, subsequently claimed that, using a different name, she had told Rantzen 18 years earlier of allegations that she had heard about Savile. Rantzen has denied hearing specific allegations and said she had no recollection of a conversation with Keenan.

Writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; before the broadcast, Katy Brand also criticised Rantzen for failing to act on rumours she had heard about Savile. Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, at Keenan&#x27;s request, temporarily asked for all references to Rantzen to be removed from the charity&#x27;s website, but subsequently defended Rantzen and said she would continue as a patron.

==Personal life==
In 1966, at the age of 26, Rantzen had an affair with the Scottish politician Nicholas Fairbairn. She wrote:
In 1968, Rantzen started an affair with Desmond Wilcox, who was the head of her department and married to Rantzen&#x27;s friend Patsy who also worked at the BBC. After several years they decided to live together, and informed BBC management of their relationship. Management&#x27;s solution was to move the entire production team of &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; out of Wilcox&#x27;s department. The new arrangement meant that Rantzen and Patsy were now working in the same department, embarrassing Rantzen and causing further pain to Patsy. Patsy Wilcox had always refused to divorce her husband, but agreed when Rantzen became pregnant. After Rantzen and Wilcox married in December 1977, BBC management moved her back into the General Features department run by him. By that time, &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; was achieving huge audience ratings and reaching the number one position, gaining more viewers than &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. This created tension among colleagues in General Features, who ascribed the success of the programme to Wilcox&#x27;s relationship with Rantzen. They complained to management, quoting the BBC&#x27;s regulation that husbands and wives should not work in the same department.

As a result, Wilcox resigned, and set up his own independent production company, making award-winning documentaries such as &quot;The Visit&quot;, which included a series of programmes about &quot;The Boy David&quot;. For these, as well as previous films, he received many international awards, including the Grierson Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001. Wilcox and Rantzen had three children – Miriam (formerly known as Emily, b. 1978), Rebecca (b. 1980), and Joshua (b. 1981).

In 2001, Patsy&#x27;s daughter Cassandra Wilcox gave an interview in response to comments Rantzen had made about Patsy in her autobiography, alleging amongst other things that Rantzen had long harboured animosity towards Patsy.

In January 2023, Rantzen announced that she had been diagnosed with lung cancer. In a statement, Rantzen said, &quot;In the last few weeks I have discovered that I am suffering from lung cancer which has now spread. At the moment I am undergoing various tests, to assess the best treatment ... I have decided not to keep this secret any more because I find it difficult to skulk around various hospitals wearing an unconvincing disguise, and because I would rather you heard the facts from me. ... As I am sure you will understand, while I am awaiting the results of the tests, I am unable to answer questions. Thanks to the extraordinary skills of the medical profession there are wonderful new treatments, so I am remaining optimistic.&quot;

In May 2023, Rantzen announced that her lung cancer had reached stage IV and that she was on a new form of medication. In December 2023, in an article in &quot;The Times&quot;, she reflected on her mortality. On 19 December she said that she had joined the Dignitas assisted dying clinic in Switzerland. She lives in the New Forest, Hampshire.

Rantzen has also received a number of professional awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Women in Film and Television organisation, the Royal Television Society&#x27;s Special Judges&#x27; Award for Journalism, their Fellowship, and Membership of their Hall of Fame. She was the first woman to receive a Dimbleby Award from BAFTA for factual presentation. She received the Snowdon Award for services to disabled people.

<text>The dura mater, (or just dura) is the outermost of the three meningeal membranes. The dura mater has two layers, an outer periosteal layer closely adhered to the neurocranium, and an inner meningeal layer known as the &quot;dural border cell layer&quot;. The two dural layers are for the most part fused together forming a thick fibrous tissue membrane that covers the brain and the vertebrae of the spinal column. But the layers are separated at the dural venous sinuses to allow blood to drain from the brain. The dura covers the arachnoid mater and the pia mater the other two meninges in protecting the central nervous system.

At major boundaries of brain regions such as the longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres, and the tentorium cerebelli between the posterior brain and the cerebellum the dura separates, folds and invaginates to make the divisions. These folds are known as dural folds, or reflections.

The dura mater is primarily derived from neural crest cells, with postnatal contributions from the paraxial mesoderm.

==Structure==
The dura mater has several functions and layers. The dura mater is a membrane that envelops the arachnoid mater. It surrounds and supports the dural venous sinuses that reabsorbs cerebrospinal fluid and carries the cerebral venous return, back toward the heart.

Cranial dura mater has two layers which include a superficial &quot;periosteal&quot; layer that is actually the inner periosteum of the neurocranium (the calvarium and endocranium); and a deep meningeal layer, which is the true dura mater. The dura mater covering the spinal cord is known as the &quot;dural sac&quot; or thecal sac, and only has one layer (the meningeal layer) unlike cranial dura mater. The potential space between these two layers is known as the epidural space, which can accumulate blood in the case of traumatic laceration to the meningeal arteries.

===Folds and reflections===

The dura separates into two layers at &quot;dural reflections&quot; (also known as &quot;dural folds&quot;), places where the inner dural layer is reflected as sheet-like protrusions into the cranial cavity. There are two main dural reflections:

* The tentorium cerebelli exists between and separates the cerebellum and brainstem from the occipital lobes of the cerebrum.
* The falx cerebri, which separates the two hemispheres of the brain, is located in the longitudinal cerebral fissure between the hemispheres.

Two other dural infoldings are the cerebellar falx and the sellar diaphragm:
* The cerebellar falx (falx cerebelli) is a vertical dural infolding that lies inferior to the cerebellar tentorium in the posterior part of the posterior cranial fossa. It partially separates the cerebellar hemispheres.
* The sellar diaphragm is the smallest dural infolding and is a circular sheet of dura that is suspended between the clinoid processes, forming a partial roof over the hypophysial fossa. The sellar diaphragm covers the pituitary gland in this fossa and has an aperture for passage of the infundibulum (pituitary stalk) and hypophysial veins.

===Blood supply===

This depends upon the area of the cranial cavity: in the anterior cranial fossa the anterior meningeal artery (branch from the ethmoidal artery) is responsible for blood supply, in the middle cranial fossa the middle meningeal artery and some accessory arteries are responsible for blood supply, the middle meningeal artery is a direct branch from the maxillary artery and enter the cranial cavity through the foramen spinosum and then divides into anterior (which runs usually in vertical direction across the pterion) and posterior (which runs posterosuperiorly) branches, while the accessory meningeal arteries (which are branches from the maxillary artery) enter the skull through foramen ovale and supply area between the two foramina, and the in posterior cranial fossa the dura mater has numerous blood supply from different possible arteries:

A. posterior meningeal artery (from the ascending pharyngeal artery through the jugular foramen)
B. meningeal arteries (from the ascending pharyngeal artery through hypoglossal canal)
C. meningeal arteries (from occipital artery through jugular or mastoid foramen)
D. meningeal arteries (from vertebral artery through foramen magnum)

===Drainage===
The two layers of dura mater run together throughout most of the skull. Where they separate, the gap between them is called a dural venous sinus. These sinuses drain blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain and empty into the internal jugular vein.

Arachnoid villi, which are outgrowths of the arachnoid mater (the middle meningeal layer), extend into the dural venous sinuses to drain CSF. These villi act as one-way valves.
Meningeal veins, which course through the dura mater, and bridging veins, which drain the underlying neural tissue and puncture the dura mater, empty into these dural sinuses. A rupture of a bridging vein causes a subdural hematoma.

===Nerve supply===
The supratentorial dura mater membrane is supplied by small meningeal branches of the trigeminal nerve (V1, V2 and V3). The innervation for the infratentorial dura mater are via upper cervical nerves and the meningeal branch of the vagus nerve.

==Clinical significance==
Many medical conditions involve the dura mater. A subdural hematoma occurs when there is an abnormal collection of blood between the dura and the arachnoid, usually as a result of torn bridging veins secondary to head trauma. An epidural hematoma is a collection of blood between the dura and the inner surface of the skull, and is usually due to arterial bleeding. Intradural procedures, such as removal of a brain tumour or treatment of trigeminal neuralgia via a microvascular decompression, require that an incision is made to the dura mater. To achieve a watertight repair and avoid potential post-operative complications, the dura is typically closed with sutures. If there is a dural deficiency, then a dural substitute may be used to replace this membrane. Small gaps in the dura can be covered with a surgical sealant film.

In 2011, researchers discovered a connective tissue bridge from the rectus capitis posterior major to the cervical dura mater. Various clinical manifestations may be linked to this anatomical relationship such as headaches, trigeminal neuralgia and other symptoms that involved the cervical dura. The rectus capitis posterior minor has a similar attachment.

The dura-muscular, dura-ligamentous connections in the upper cervical spine and occipital areas may provide anatomic and physiologic answers to the cause of the cervicogenic headache. This proposal would further explain manipulation&#x27;s efficacy in the treatment of cervicogenic headache.

The American Red Cross and some other agencies accepting blood donations consider dura mater transplants, along with receipt of pituitary-derived growth hormone, a risk factor due to concerns about Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.

Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, or Chiari malformation, is a condition that was previously thought to be congenital but can be induced by trauma, particularly whiplash trauma. Dural strain may be pulling the cerebellum inferiorly, or skull distortions may be pushing the brain inferiorly.

Dural ectasia is the enlargement of the dura and is common in connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. These conditions are sometimes found in conjunction with Arnold–Chiari malformation.

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak is the fluid and pressure loss of spinal fluid due to holes in the dura mater.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;&quot; derives from the Latin for &quot;tough mother (or hard mother)&quot;, a loan translation of Arabic (), literally &#x27;thick mother of the brain&#x27;, matrix of the brain, and is also referred to by the term &quot;pachymeninx&quot; (plural &quot;pachymeninges&quot;).

<text>Grand strategy or high strategy is a state&#x27;s strategy of how means (military and nonmilitary) can be used to advance and achieve national interests in the long-term. Issues of grand strategy typically include the choice of military doctrine, force structure and alliances, as well as economic relations, diplomatic behavior, and methods to extract or mobilize resources.

In contrast to strategy, grand strategy encompasses more than military means (such as diplomatic and economic means); does not equate success with purely military victory but also the pursuit of peacetime goals and prosperity; and considers goals and interests in the long-term rather than short-term.

In contrast to foreign policy, grand strategy emphasizes the military implications of policy; considers costs benefits of policies, as well as limits on capabilities; establishes priorities; and sets out a practical plan rather than a set of ambitions and wishes. A country&#x27;s political leadership typically directs grand strategy with input from the most senior military officials. Development of a nation&#x27;s grand strategy may extend across many years or even multiple generations.

Much scholarship on grand strategy focuses on the United States, which has since the end of World War II had a grand strategy oriented around primacy, &quot;deep engagement&quot;, and/or liberal hegemony, which entail that the United States maintains military predominance; maintains an extensive network of allies (exemplified by NATO, bilateral alliances and foreign US military bases); and integrates other states into US-designed international institutions (such as the IMF, WTO/GATT and World Bank). Critics of this grand strategy, which includes proponents for offshore balancing, selective engagement, restraint, and isolationism, argue for pulling back.

Daniel Assamah and Shaoyu Yuan, challenge the prevailing notion that only great powers are capable of having grand strategies. They found that smaller states like Rwanda can, and do, deploy national resources in response to external challenges and opportunities, which is a hallmark of grand strategy. This approach is influenced by the country&#x27;s historical memory and involves a complex interplay of military, economic, and diplomatic tools tailored to the specific context of Rwanda.

==Definition==
There is no universally accepted definition of grand strategy. One common definition is that grand strategy is a state&#x27;s strategy of how means (military and nonmilitary) can be used to advance and achieve national interests in the long-term.
Grand strategy expands on the traditional idea of strategy in three ways:
# expanding strategy beyond military means to include diplomatic, financial, economic, informational, etc. means
# examining internal in addition to external forces – taking into account both the various instruments of power and the internal policies necessary for their implementation (conscription, for example)
# including consideration of periods of peacetime in addition to wartime
Thinkers differ as to whether grand strategy should serve to promote peace (as emphasized by B. H. Liddell Hart) or advance the security of a state (as emphasized by Barry Posen).

British military historian B. H. Liddell Hart played an influential role in popularizing the concept of grand strategy in the mid-20th century. Subsequent definitions tend to build on his. He defines grand strategy as follows:
[T]he role of grand strategy – higher strategy – is to co-ordinate and direct all the resources of a nation, or band of nations, towards the attainment of the political object of the war – the goal defined by fundamental policy.

Grand strategy should both calculate and develop the economic resources and man-power of nations in order to sustain the fighting services. Also the moral resources – for to foster the people&#x27;s willing spirit is often as important as to possess the more concrete forms of power. Grand strategy, too, should regulate the distribution of power between the several services, and between the services and industry. Moreover, fighting power is but one of the instruments of grand strategy – which should take account of and apply the power of financial pressure, and, not least of ethical pressure, to weaken the opponent&#x27;s will. ...

Furthermore, while the horizons of strategy is bounded by the war, grand strategy looks beyond the war to the subsequent peace. It should not only combine the various instruments, but so regulate their use as to avoid damage to the future state of peace – for its security and prosperity.
=== History ===
In antiquity, the Greek word &quot;strategy&quot; referred to the skills of a general. By the sixth century, Byzantines distinguished between &quot;strategy&quot; (the means by which a general defends the homeland and defeats the enemy) and &quot;tactics&quot; (the science of organizing armies). Byzantine Emperor Leo VI distinguished between the two terms in his work &quot;Taktika&quot;.

Prior to the French Revolution, most thinkers wrote on military science rather than grand strategy. The term grand strategy first emerged in France in the 19th century. Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, wrote an influential work, &quot;General Essay on Tactics&quot;, that distinguished between &quot;tactics&quot; and &quot;grand tactics&quot; (which scholars today would refer to as grand strategy). Emperor Leo&#x27;s &quot;Taktika&quot; was shortly thereafter translated into French and German, leading most thinkers to distinguish between tactics and strategy.

Carl von Clausewitz proposed in an influential work that politics and war were intrinsically linked. Clausewitz defined strategy as &quot;the use of engagements for the object of the war&quot;. Antoine-Henri Jomini argued that because of the intrinsically political nature of war that different types of wars (e.g. offensive wars, defensive wars, wars of expediency, wars with/without allies, wars of intervention, wars of conquest, wars of opinion, national wars, civil wars) had to be waged differently, thus creating the need for a grand strategy. Some contemporaries of Clausewitz and Jomini disputed the links between politics and war, arguing that politics ceases to be important once war has begun.

Narrow definitions, similar to those of Clausewitz, were commonplace during the 19th century. Towards the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century (in particular with B. H. Liddell Hart&#x27;s writings), some writers expanded the definition of strategy to refer to the distribution and application of military means to achieve policy objectives. For these thinkers, grand strategy was not only different from the operational strategy of winning a particular battle, but it also encompassed both peacetime and wartime policies. For them, grand strategy should operate for decades (or longer) and should not cease at war&#x27;s end or begin at war&#x27;s start.

In the 20th century, some thinkers argued that all manners of actions (political, economic, military, cultural) counted as grand strategy in an era of total warfare. However, most definitions saw a division of labor between the actions of political leaders and those of the executing military.

According to Helmuth von Moltke, the initial task of strategy was to serve politics and the subsequent task was to prepare the means to wage war. Moltke however warned that plans may not survive an encounter with the enemy. Other thinkers challenged Clausewitz&#x27;s idea that politics could set the aims of war, as the aims of war would change during the war given the success or failure of military operations.These thinkers argued that strategy was a process that required adaptation to changing circumstances.

Scholarship on grand strategy experienced a resurgence in the late 1960s and 1970s. Bernard Brodie defined strategy as &quot;guide to accomplishing something and doing it efficiently... a theory for action&quot;.

==Historical examples==
According to historian Hal Brands, &quot;all states... do grand strategy, but many of them do not do it particularly well.&quot;

===Peloponnesian War===
One of the earlier writings on grand strategy comes from Thucydides&#x27;s &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, an account of the war between the Peloponnesian League (led by Sparta) and the Delian League (led by Athens).

===Roman Empire===

From the era of Hadrian, Roman emperors employed a military strategy of &quot;preclusive security—the establishment of a linear barrier of perimeter defence around the Empire. The Legions were stationed in great fortresses&quot;. These &quot;fortresses&quot; existed along the perimeter of the Empire, often accompanied by actual walls (for example, Hadrian&#x27;s Wall). Due to the perceived impenetrability of these perimeter defenses, the Emperors kept no central reserve army. The Roman system of roads allowed for soldiers to move from one frontier to another (for the purpose of reinforcements during a siege) with relative ease. These roads also allowed for a logistical advantage for Rome over her enemies, as supplies could be moved just as easily across the Roman road system as soldiers. This way, if the legions could not win a battle through military combat skill or superior numbers, they could simply outlast the invaders, who, as historian E.A. Thompson wrote, &quot;Did not think in terms of millions of bushels of wheat.&quot;

The emperor Constantine moved the legions from the frontiers to one consolidated roving army as a way to save money and to protect wealthier citizens within the cities. However, this grand strategy, according to some ancient sources, had costly effects on the Roman empire by weakening its frontier defenses and allowing it to be susceptible to outside armies coming in. Also, people who lived near the Roman frontiers would begin to look to the barbarians for protection after the Roman armies departed. This argument is considered to have originated in the writings of Eunapius. As stated by the 5th century AD historian Zosimus: 
This charge by Zosimus is considered to be a gross exaggeration and inaccurate assessment of the situations in the fourth century under Constantine by many modern historians. B.H. Warmington, for instance, argues that the statement by Zosimus is &quot;[an] oversimplification,&quot; reminding us that &quot;the charge of exposure of the frontier regions is at best anachronistic and probably reflects Zosimus&#x27; prejudices against Constantine; the corruption of the soldiers who lived in the cities was a literary commonplace.&quot;

===World War II===
An example of modern grand strategy is the decision of the Allies in World War II to concentrate on the defeat of Germany first. The decision, a joint agreement made after the attack on Pearl Harbor (1941) had drawn the US into the war, was a sensible one in that Germany was the most powerful member of the Axis, and directly threatened the existence of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Conversely, while Japan&#x27;s conquests garnered considerable public attention, they were mostly in colonial areas deemed less essential by planners and policy-makers. The specifics of Allied military strategy in the Pacific War were therefore shaped by the lesser resources made available to the theatre commanders.

===Cold War===
The US and the UK used a policy of containment as part of their grand strategy during the Cold War.

==In the United States==
The conversation around grand strategy in the United States has evolved significantly since the country&#x27;s founding, with the nation shifting from a strategy of continental expansion, isolation from European conflicts, and opposition to European empires in the Western hemisphere in its first century, to a major debate about the acquisition of an empire in the 1890s (culminating in the conquest of the Philippines and Cuba during the Spanish–American War), followed by rapid shifts between offshore balancing, liberal internationalism, and isolationism around the world wars. The Cold War saw increasing use of deep, onshore engagement strategies (including the creation of a number of permanent alliances, significant involvement in other states&#x27; internal politics, and a major counterinsurgency war in Vietnam.) With the end of the Cold War, an early strategic debate eventually coalesced into a strategy of primacy, culminating in the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The aftershocks of this war, along with an economic downturn, rising national debt, and deepening political gridlock, have led to a renewed strategic debate, centered on two major schools of thought: primacy and restraint. A return to offshore balancing has also been proposed by prominent political scientists Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer.

=== In the 1990s ===
The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union removed the focal point of U.S. strategy: containing the Soviet Union. A major debate emerged about the future direction of U.S. foreign policy. In a 1997 article, Barry R. Posen and Andrew L. Ross identified four major grand strategic alternatives in the debate:

# neo-isolationism
# selective engagement
# cooperative security
# primacy

====Neo-isolationism====
Stemming from a defensive realist understanding of international politics, what the authors call &quot;neo-isolationism&quot; advocates the United States remove itself from active participation in international politics in order to maintain its national security. It holds that because there are no threats to the American homeland, the United States does not need to intervene abroad. Stressing a particular understanding of nuclear weapons, the authors describe how proponents believe the destructive power of nuclear weapons and retaliatory potential of the United States assure the political sovereignty and territorial integrity of the United States, while the proliferation of such weapons to countries like Britain, France, China and Russia prevents the emergence of any competing hegemon on the Eurasian landmass. The United States&#x27; security and the absence of threats means that &quot;national defense will seldom justify intervention abroad.&quot; Even further, its proponents argue that &quot;the United States is not responsible for, and cannot afford the costs of, maintaining world order.&quot; They also believe that &quot;the pursuit of economic well-being is best left to the private sector,&quot; and that the United States should not attempt to spread its values because doing so increases resentment towards the U.S. and in turn, decreases its security. In short, neo-isolationism advises the United States to preserve its freedom of action and strategic independence.

In more practical terms, the authors discuss how the implementation of a so-called &quot;neo-isolationist&quot; grand strategy would involve less focus on the issue of nuclear proliferation, withdrawal from NATO, and major cuts to the United States military presence abroad. The authors see a military force structure that prioritizes a secure nuclear second-strike capability, intelligence, naval and special operations forces while limiting the forward-deployment of forces to Europe and Asia.

Posen and Ross identify such prominent scholars and political figures as Earl Ravenal, Patrick Buchanan and Doug Bandow.

==== Selective engagement ====
With similar roots in the realist tradition of international relations, selective engagement advocates that the United States should intervene in regions of the world only if they directly affect its security and prosperity. The focus, therefore, lies on those powers with significant industrial and military potential and the prevention of war amongst those states. Most proponents of this strategy believe Europe, Asia and the Middle East matter most to the United States. Europe and Asia contain the great powers, which have the greatest military and economic impact on international politics, and the Middle East is a primary source of oil for much of the developed world. In addition to these more particular concerns, selective engagement also focuses on preventing nuclear proliferation and any conflict that could lead to a great power war, but provides no clear guidelines for humanitarian interventions.

The authors envision that a strategy of selective engagement would involve a strong nuclear deterrent with a force structure capable of fighting two regional wars, each through some combination of ground, air and sea forces complemented with forces from a regional ally. They question, however, whether such a policy could garner sustained support from a liberal democracy experienced with a moralistic approach to international relations, whether the United States could successfully differentiate necessary versus unnecessary engagement and whether a strategy that focuses on Europe, Asia and the Middle East actually represents a shift from current engagement.

In the piece, Barry Posen classified himself as a &quot;selective engagement&quot; advocate, with the caveat that the United States should not only act to reduce the likelihood of great power war, but also oppose the rise of a Eurasian hegemon capable of threatening the United States.

Robert J. Art argues that selective engagement is the best strategy for the twenty-first century because it is, by definition, selective. &quot;It steers the middle course between an isolationist, unilateralist course, on the one hand, and world policeman, highly interventionist role, on the other.&quot; Therefore, Art, concludes, it avoids both overly restrictive and overly expansive definitions of U.S. interests, finding instead a compromise between doing too much and too little militarily. Additionally, selective engagement is the best strategy for achieving both realist goals—preventing WMD terrorism, maintaining great power peace, and securing the supply of oil; and liberal goals—preserving free trade, spreading democracy, observing human rights, and minimizing the impact of climate change. The realist goals represent vital interests and the liberal goals represent desirable interests. Desirable interests are not unimportant, Art maintains, but they are of lesser importance when a trade-off between them and vital interests must be made. Selective engagement, however, mitigates the effect of the trade-off precisely because it is a moderate, strategic policy.

====Cooperative security====

The authors write &quot;the most important distinguishing feature of cooperative security is the proposition that peace is effectively indivisible.&quot; Unlike the other three alternatives, cooperative security draws upon liberalism as well as realism in its approach to international relations. Stressing the importance of world peace and international cooperation, the view supposes the growth in democratic governance and the use of international institutions will hopefully overcome the security dilemma and deter interstate conflict. Posen and Ross propose that collective action is the most effective means of preventing potential state and non-state aggressors from threatening other states. Cooperative security considers nuclear proliferation, regional conflicts and humanitarian crises to be major interests of the United States.

The authors imagine that such a grand strategy would involve stronger support for international institutions, agreements, and the frequent use of force for humanitarian purposes. Were international institutions to ultimately entail the deployment of a multinational force, the authors suppose the United States&#x27; contribution would emphasize command, control, communications and intelligence, defense suppression, and precision-guided munitions-what they considered at the time to be the United States&#x27; comparative advantage in aerospace power. Collective action problems, the problems of the effective formation of international institutions, the vacillating feelings of democratic populations, and the limitations of arms control are all offered by the authors as noted criticisms of collective security.

====Primacy====
Primacy is a grand strategy with four parts:

# Military preponderance
# Reassurances and containment of allies
# Integration of other states into US-designed institutions
# Limits to the spread of nuclear weapons

As a result, it advocates that the United States pursue ultimate hegemony and dominate the international system economically, politically and militarily, rejecting any return to bipolarity or multipolarity and preventing the emergence of any peer competitor. Therefore, its proponents argue that U.S. foreign policy should focus on maintaining U.S. power and preventing any other power from becoming a serious challenger to the United States. With this in mind, some supporters of this strategy argue that the U.S. should work to contain China and other competitors rather than engage them. In regards to humanitarian crises and regional conflicts, primacy holds that the U.S. should only intervene when they directly impact national security, more along the lines of selective engagement than collective security. It does, however, advocate for the active prevention of nuclear proliferation at a level similar to collective security.

Implementation of such a strategy would entail military forces at similar levels to those during the Cold War, with emphasis on military modernization and research and development. They note, however, that &quot;the quest for primacy is likely to prove futile for five reasons&quot;: the diffusion of economic and technological capabilities, interstate balancing against the United States, the danger that hegemonic leadership will fatally undermine valuable multilateral institutions, the feasibility of preventive war and the dangers of imperial overstretch.

Daniel Drezner, professor of international politics at Tufts University, outlines three arguments offered by primacy enthusiasts contending that military preeminence generates positive economic externalities. &quot;One argument, which I label &#x27;geoeconomic favoritism,&#x27; hypothesizes that the military hegemon will attract private capital because it provides the greatest security and safety to investors. A second argument posits that the benefits from military primacy flow from geopolitical favoritism: that sovereign states, in return for living under the security umbrella of the military superpower, voluntarily transfer resources to help subsidize the cost of the economy. The third argument postulates that states are most likely to enjoy global public goods under a unipolar distribution of military power, accelerating global economic growth and reducing security tensions. These public goods benefit the hegemon as much, if not more, than they do other actors.&quot; Drezner maintains the empirical evidence supporting the third argument is the strongest, though with some qualifiers. &quot;Although the precise causal mechanism remain disputed, hegemonic eras are nevertheless strongly correlated with lower trade barriers and greater levels of globalization.&quot; However, Drezner highlights a caveat: The cost of maintaining global public goods catches up to the superpower providing them. &quot;Other countries free-ride off of the hegemon, allowing them to grow faster. Technologies diffuse from the hegemonic power to the rest of the world, facilitating catch-up. Chinese analysts have posited that these phenomena, occurring right now, are allowing China to outgrow the United States.&quot;

====Primacy vs. selective engagement====
Barry Posen, director of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, believes the activist U.S. foreign policy that continues to define U.S. strategy in the twenty-first century is an &quot;undisciplined, expensive, and bloody strategy&quot; that has done more harm than good to U.S. national security. &quot;It makes enemies almost as fast as it slays them, discourages allies from paying for their own defense, and convinces powerful states to band together and oppose Washington&#x27;s plans, further raising the costs of carrying out its foreign policy.&quot; The United States was able to afford such adventurism during the 1990s, Posen argues, because American power projection was completely unchallenged. Over the last decade, however, American power has been relatively declining while the Pentagon continues to &quot;depend on continuous infusions of cash simply to retain its current force structure—levels of spending that the Great Recession and the United States&#x27; ballooning debt have rendered unsustainable.&quot;

Posen proposes the United States abandon its hegemonic strategy and replace it with one of restraint. This translates into jettisoning the quest of shaping a world that is satisfactory to U.S. values and instead advances vital national security interests: The U.S. military would go to war only when it must. Large troop contingents in unprecedentedly peaceful regions such as Europe would be significantly downsized, incentivizing NATO members to provide more for their own security. Under such a scenario, the United States would have more leeway in using resources to combat the most pressing threats to its security. A strategy of restraint, therefore, would help preserve the country&#x27;s prosperity and security more so than a hegemonic strategy. To be sure, Posen makes clear that he is not advocating isolationism. Rather, the United States should focus on three pressing security challenges: preventing a powerful rival from upending the global balance of power, fighting terrorists, and limiting nuclear proliferation.

John Ikenberry of Princeton University and Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth, both of Dartmouth College, push back on Posen&#x27;s selective engagement thesis, arguing that American engagement is not as bad as Posen makes it out to be. Advocates of selective engagement, they argue, overstate the costs of current U.S. grand strategy and understate the benefits. &quot;The benefits of deep engagement...are legion. U.S. security commitments reduce competition in key regions and act as a check against potential rivals. They help maintain an open world economy and give Washington leverage in economic negotiations. And they make it easier for the United States to secure cooperation for combating a wide range of global threats.&quot;

Ikenberry, Brooks, and Wohlforth are not convinced that the current U.S. grand strategy generates subsequent counterbalancing. Unlike the prior hegemons, the United States is geographically isolated and faces no contiguous great power rivals interested in balancing it. This means the United States is far less threatening to great powers that are situated oceans away, the authors claim. Moreover, any competitor would have a hard time matching U.S. military might. &quot;Not only is the United States so far ahead militarily in both quantitative and qualitative terms, but its security guarantees also give it the leverage to prevent allies from giving military technology to potential U.S. rivals. Because the United States dominates the high-end defense industry, it can trade access to its defense market for allies&#x27; agreement not to transfer key military technologies to its competitors.&quot;

Finally, when the United States wields its security leverage, the authors argue, it shapes the overall structure of the global economy. &quot;Washington wins when U.S. allies favor [the] status quo, and one reason they are inclined to support the existing system is because they value their military alliances.&quot;

Ted Carpenter, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, believes that the proponents of primacy suffer from the &quot;light-switch model,&quot; in which only two positions exist: on and off. &quot;Many, seemingly most, proponents of U.S. preeminence do not recognize the existence of options between current policy of promiscuous global interventionism and isolationism.&quot; Adherence to the light switch model, Carpenter argues, reflects intellectual rigidity or an effort to stifle discussion about a range of alternatives to the status quo. Selective engagement is a strategy that sits in between primacy and isolationism and, given growing multipolarity and American fiscal precariousness, should be taken seriously. &quot;Selectivity is not merely an option when it comes to embarking on military interventions. It is imperative for a major power that wishes to preserve its strategic insolvency. Otherwise, overextension and national exhaustion become increasing dangers.&quot; Carpenter thinks that off-loading U.S. security responsibility must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, the United States must refrain from using military might in campaigns that do not directly deal with U.S. interests. &quot;If a sense of moral indignation, instead of a calculating assessment of the national interest, governs U.S. foreign policy, the United States will become involved in even more murky conflicts in which few if any tangible American interests are at stake.&quot;

=== Today ===
Posen has argued that the four schools of U.S. grand strategy that he identified in the 1990s have been replaced by just two: liberal hegemony, which came from a fusion of primacy and cooperative security, and restraint, which came from a fusion of neo-isolationism and selective engagement. Other scholars have proposed a third policy, offshore balancing.

==== Liberal hegemony ====
Proponents of liberal hegemony favor a world order in which the United States is a hegemon and uses this power advantage to create a liberal international system and at times use force to enforce or spread liberal values (such as individual rights, free trade, and the rule of law). The United States strives to retain overwhelming military power, under a theory that potential competitors will not even try to compete on the global stage. It also retains an extensive network of permanent alliance commitments around the world, using the alliance system both to advance and retain hegemonic power and to solidify emerging liberal political systems. According to Posen, this strategy sees &quot;threats emanating from three major sources: failed states, rogue states, and illiberal peer competitors.&quot; Failed states, in this view, are sources of instability; rogue states can sponsor terrorism, acquire weapons of mass destruction, and behave unpredictably; illiberal peer competitors would compete directly with the United States and &quot;would complicate the spread of liberal institutions and the construction of liberal states.&quot; Support for liberal hegemonic strategies among major thinkers in both political parties helps explain the broad elite support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 intervention in Libya, even though U.S. military involvement in those conflicts had been initiated by presidents of different parties. The chief difference on foreign policy between Republican and Democratic proponents of liberal hegemony, according to Posen, is on support for international institutions as a means to achieving hegemony.

==== Restraint ====
Proponents of a grand strategy of restraint call for the United States to significantly reduce its overseas security commitments and largely avoid involvement in conflicts abroad. America would take advantage of what Posen calls a &quot;remarkably good&quot; strategic position: &quot;[The United States] is rich, distant from other great powers, and defended by a powerful nuclear deterrent. Other great powers are at present weaker than the United States, close to one another, and face the same pressures to defend themselves as does the United States.&quot; Proponents of strategic restraint argue, consistent with the realist tradition, that states are self-interested and accordingly will look out for their own interests and balance against aggressors; however, when possible, states prefer to &quot;free ride&quot; or &quot;cheap ride,&quot; passing the buck to other states to bear the cost of balancing. Restraint proponents also emphasize the deterrent power of nuclear weapons, which tremendously raise the stakes of confrontations between great powers, breeding caution, rather than rewarding aggression. Restraint advocates see nationalism as a powerful force, one that makes states even more resistant to outside conquest and thus makes the international system more stable. Restraint proponents also argue, drawing on thinkers like the Prussian strategist Carl von Clausewitz, that military force is a blunt, expensive, and unpredictable instrument, and that it accordingly should only be used rarely, for clear goals.

Restraint is distinct from isolationism: isolationists favor restricting trade and immigration and tend to believe that events in the outside world have little impact within the United States. As already noted, it is sometimes confused with non-interventionism. Restraint, however, sees economic dynamism as a key source of national power and accordingly tends to argue for a relatively open trade system. Some restrainers call for supporting this trade system via significant naval patrols; others suggest that the international economy is resilient against disruptions and, with rare exceptions, does not require a powerful state to guarantee the security of global trade.

==== Offshore balancing ====
In offshore balancing, the United States would refrain from significant involvement in security affairs overseas except to prevent a state from establishing hegemony in what offshore balancers identify as the world&#x27;s three key strategic regions: Europe, Northeast Asia, and the Persian Gulf. This strategy advocates a significantly reduced overseas presence compared to liberal hegemony, but argues that intervention is necessary in more circumstances than restraint. Offshore balancing is associated with offensive realist theories of state behavior: it believes that conquest can often enable states to gain power, and thus that a hegemon in regions with large economies, high populations, or critical resources could quickly become a global menace to U.S. national interests.

<text>Joseph Smith III (November 6, 1832 – December 10, 1914) was the eldest surviving son of Joseph Smith (founder of the Latter Day Saint movement) and Emma Hale Smith. Joseph Smith III was the Prophet-President of what became the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), renamed Community of Christ in 2001, which considers itself a continuation of the church established by Smith&#x27;s father in 1830. For fifty-four years until his own death, Smith presided over the church. Smith&#x27;s moderate ideas and nature set much of the tone for the church&#x27;s development, earning him the sobriquet of &quot;the pragmatic prophet&quot;.

==Biography==
===Childhood===

Joseph Smith III was born in Kirtland, Ohio, on November 6, 1832, to Joseph Smith Jr, and Emma Hale Smith. He moved with his parents to Far West, Missouri, in 1838, where his father was arrested partially as a result of the events in the 1838 Mormon War. Young Joseph was able to stay overnight with his father in prison on several occasions. It was later alleged by fellow prisoner and church apostle Lyman Wight that during one of these visits, his father laid his hands upon Joseph III&#x27;s head and said, &quot;You are my successor when I depart.&quot; While his father was still imprisoned in 1839, Joseph III left Missouri with his mother and siblings and moved to Quincy, Illinois, and later to the new settlement of Nauvoo. The elder Smith escaped custody later that year and rejoined the family.

At Nauvoo, the Latter Day Saints created a militia known as the Nauvoo Legion and soon afterward, 500 of the town&#x27;s boys created their own junior version of the militia. Joseph III became general of the junior militia whose motto was, &quot;our fathers we respect, our mothers we&#x27;ll protect.&quot;

According to later reminiscences, Joseph III was blessed by his father at a special council meeting of church officials held on the second floor of the Smith family&#x27;s Red Brick Store in Nauvoo. By some accounts, participants also included Hyrum Smith, John Taylor, Willard Richards, Newel K. Whitney, Reynolds Cahoon, Alpheus Cutler, Ebenezer Robinson, George J. Adams, W. W. Phelps, and John M. Bernhisel. Joseph III&#x27;s father reportedly seated him in a chair and Whitney anointed his head with oil. Then the elder Smith reportedly pronounced a special blessing upon his son&#x27;s head that suggested that Joseph III would succeed him as church president if he lived righteously.

Joseph Smith died at Carthage, Illinois, when Joseph III was 11 years old. Although many Latter Day Saints believed that Joseph III should succeed his father, his young age in 1844 made that impractical. A succession crisis ensued which resulted in Brigham Young taking lead of the majority of church members as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Three years later Young became the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Relations between Young and the Smith family were strained and many of the Smiths chose to recognize James J. Strang as church president. Young and the majority of the Latter Day Saints departed Nauvoo in 1846, leaving the Smith family in a mostly empty city. Smith&#x27;s mother, Emma, attempted to make a living renting out rooms in the family home; in 1847, Emma married a second husband named Lewis Bidamon.

Joseph III began to study and eventually practice law. In 1856, he married Emmeline Griswold and the couple moved into a house that was his parents&#x27; first residence in Nauvoo. They had five children: Rebecca, Emma, Carrie, Zaide, and Joseph Arthur. After Emmeline died of probable tuberculosis, he married their housekeeper, Bertha Madison, on November 12, 1869. They had seven children: David Carlos, Mary Audentia, Frederick Madison, Israel &quot;Dutch&quot; Alexander, Kenneth, Bertha Azuba, and Hale. Bertha Madison Smith died from injuries sustained in a carriage accident in 1895. On January 12, 1898 Joseph Smith III wed Ada Rachel Clark of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They had three sons, William Wallace, Richard Clark, and Reginald Archer.

===Reorganization of the church===
In the late 1840s and early 1850s, the bulk of the Latter Day Saints either aligned themselves with Young and emigrated to Utah or they remained in the Midwest and looked to Strang as church president. Strang gave indications that he believed that a son of Joseph Smith would one day lead the church and made overtures to the Smith family. Emma and her sons, however, remained aloof. Many midwestern Latter Day Saints were adamantly opposed to plural marriage and when Strang began to openly practice the doctrine in 1849, several key leaders, including Jason W. Briggs and Zenas H. Gurley, Sr. broke with his leadership. Later, when Strang was mortally wounded by assassins, he refused to name a successor, and when he died he left his church leaderless.

The midwestern Saints began to call for the need to establish a &quot;New Organization&quot; of the church and many believed that Joseph III should be its head. Latter Day Saints repeatedly visited Smith and asked him to take up his father&#x27;s mantle, but his reply was that he would only assume the church presidency if he were inspired by God to do so. Finally, in 1860, Smith said that he had received this inspiration and at a conference in Amboy, Illinois on April 6, 1860, he was sustained as president of the RLDS Church. Smith III stated at the conference:

 At the time both this organization and Young&#x27;s Utah-based church claimed to be the true Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

===President of the church===

As church president, Smith was what his biographer has called a &quot; prophet.&quot; Many of RLDS Church followers were dissidents from what they felt were the excesses of a theocracy established by Smith&#x27;s father, and which they also felt were continued under Young in Utah Territory. From the start, Smith attempted to steer a middle course. Rather than deny the later and more controversial teachings of Smith&#x27;s father, such as baptism for the dead, the divinity of the Book of Abraham and the concepts of &quot;eternal progression&quot; and the &quot;plurality of gods,&quot; Smith taught that these doctrines either were never officially accepted, were misinterpreted, or should simply not be emphasized. However, Smith repeatedly taught that his father did not teach or practice plural marriage and that this practice was an invention of Young and his followers. Smith also resisted calls from his followers to announce a new gathering place or to quickly &quot;redeem&quot; and build up &quot;Zion&quot; (Independence, Missouri).

In the 1860s and 1870s, Smith began to rebuild the structure of the church, establishing a new First Presidency, Council of Twelve Apostles, seven quorums of the Seventy, and a Presiding Bishopric. Zenas H. Gurley, Sr. became President of the Council of Twelve. Smith presented a revelation which called William Marks, former presiding officer of the church&#x27;s central stake, to be his first counselor in the reorganized First Presidency. After Marks died, Smith called W. W. Blair and his brother, David Hyrum Smith, to be his counselors in the First Presidency.

In 1866, Smith moved from Nauvoo to Plano, Illinois, where the church&#x27;s printing house had been established. He personally took over the editorship of &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Herald&quot;, and Plano became the headquarters of the church. Meanwhile, Latter Day Saints adhering to the reorganization established a colony in Lamoni, Iowa, where they attempted to practice the &quot;Law of Consecration&quot; or &quot;Order of Enoch.&quot; In 1881, Smith decided to move to Lamoni which became the new headquarters of the church. Although the practice of the Order of Enoch proved a failure, the town of Lamoni continued to grow. The church established a college there which became Graceland University.

Under Smith&#x27;s presidency, the RLDS Church gained clear legal title to the Kirtland Temple in the 1880 &quot;Kirtland Temple Suit&quot;. However, the RLDS Church failed in its bid to acquire legal title to the Temple Lot in the &quot;Temple Lot Case&quot; of the late 1890s. The trial court in both cases declared that the RLDS Church was the legal rightful successor to the original Latter Day Saint church founded in 1830 by Smith&#x27;s father (it failed to gain the Temple Lot because the owners at the time appealed on the grounds that the RLDS Church waited too long to act, but the earlier rightful successor decision was upheld). Rather than focusing on the practical ownership results of the cases, Smith emphasized these court judgements for the remainder of his life as legal validation of the RLDS Church&#x27;s claims.

===Redemption of Zion===
In Smith&#x27;s final years, members of the church began to move to Independence, Missouri, which Joseph Smith had designated as the &quot;center place&quot; of the &quot;City of Zion.&quot; Many Latter Day Saints had wanted to return to this theologically important ground since their expulsion in 1839. In 1906, at the age of 73, Smith moved to Independence and entered a state of semi-retirement. His eldest son, Frederick Madison Smith, remained in Lamoni and took over active leadership of the church. Finally, on December 10, 1914, at the age of 82, Smith suffered a heart seizure in his home and died. He had been president of the church for more than fifty years and he was admired and mourned by thousands.

==Teachings on plural marriage==
Joseph Smith III was an ardent opponent of the practice of plural marriage throughout his life. For most of his career, Smith denied that his father had been involved in the practice and insisted that it had originated with Young. Smith served many missions to the western United States where he met with and interviewed associates and women claiming to be widows of his father, who attempted to present him with evidence to the contrary. In the end, Smith concluded that he was &quot;not positive nor sure that [his father] was innocent&quot; and that if, indeed, the elder Smith had been involved, it was still a false practice. However, many members of the Community of Christ, and some of the groups that were formerly associated with it are still not convinced that Joseph Smith III&#x27;s father did indeed engage in plural marriage, and feel that the evidence that he did so is largely flawed.

<doc id="636950" wikidata="Q241627" url="?curid=636950" title="Alix, Duchess of Brittany">
<text>Alix (also Alis, Alice, and of Thouars; 1200 – 21 October 1221) was Duchess of Brittany from 1203 until her death. She was also Countess of Richmond in the peerage of England.

== Life ==
Alix was born in 1200. She was the daughter of Constance, Duchess of Brittany, and her co-ruler and third husband, Guy of Thouars. According to several French historians, Constance died after giving birth to Alix&#x27;s sisters Catherine and Margaret. Alix&#x27;s older half-brother was Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, and her half-sisters were Eleanor and Matilda of Brittany, the children of Constance by Geoffrey of England. Upon the death of Richard I of England, a power struggle commenced between her half-brother Arthur and John, King of England. At the Battle of Mirebeau in 1202, Arthur and Eleanor were captured. Arthur was imprisoned at the Château de Falaise and in 1203 disappeared. Eleanor was imprisoned at Corfe Castle.

The Breton barons recognized Alix as Duchess of Brittany after the presumed death of Arthur, instead of Eleanor. This was due to fears that John might claim to rule Brittany as regent for the imprisoned Eleanor. Alix&#x27;s father became regent for Alix until 1206, when Philip II of France made himself the regent of the duchy in Alix&#x27;s name. Philip II broke off the betrothal of Alix and the Breton prince Henry of Penthièvre, and turned to his French cousin Peter of Dreux, as Alix&#x27;s husband. In 1208, John permitted Eleanor to style herself Duchess of Brittany and Countess of Richmond, but gave her no lands of Richmond Earldom. Peter married Alix on 27 January 1213, and paid homage to the French king for Brittany. In 1214 John recognized Alix as Duchess of Brittany, renouncing the claim of Eleanor.

In 1218 Peter and Alix were recognised by the English regent William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, as Earl and Countess of Richmond in place of Eleanor, who would never be released from imprisonment.

Alix died on 21 October 1221, without having exercised much control over her own inheritance. She was succeeded in the duchy by her son John I, but Peter remained the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Brittany as John I&#x27;s regent until 1237.

== Children ==
Alix and Peter had:
# John I, Duke of Brittany (–1286), married Blanche of Navarre, daughter of the king of Navarre, Theobald I of Navarre.
# Yolande of Brittany, (1218–1272), married Hugh XI of Lusignan, Count of Angoulême and Count of Marche
# Arthur of Brittany (1220–1224), betrothed to Jeanne de Craon, daughter of Amaury I de Craon and Jeanne des Roches

== Portrayals in literature ==
Alix of Thouars is the heroine of the novel &quot;Le Poids d’une couronne (légende bretonne)&quot; (1867–1868) by Gabrielle d’Étampes and is mentioned in the novel &quot;Dans l’Ombre du Passé&quot; (2020) by Léa Chaillou, where it is revealed that the heroine is named after her.

<doc id="636954" wikidata="Q172712" url="?curid=636954" title="Giancarlo Fisichella">
<text>Giancarlo &quot;Giano&quot; Fisichella (; born 14 January 1973), also known as Fisico or Fisi, is an Italian racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Fisichella won three Formula One Grands Prix across 14 seasons.

Born and raised in Rome, Fisichella is a member of the noble Fisichella family of Sicily. Fisichella competed in Formula One for Minardi, Jordan, Benetton, Sauber, Renault, Force India and Ferrari. He was also the reserve driver for Ferrari in . Fisichella took his maiden win at the chaotic 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix, a race abandoned for safety reasons with 15 laps remaining. After several days of confusion regarding rules and technicalities, Fisichella was eventually declared the winner in the following week, and collected his trophy in an unofficial ceremony at the following race. He was brought into the Renault team to replace fellow Italian Jarno Trulli, and won his first race with the team in Australia in 2005. However, after that race it was his teammate, the Spanish driver Fernando Alonso, who would win the greater share of races for Renault. Although highly rated as a driver, Fisichella was unable to keep pace with eventual champion Alonso, managing just one further race win following his debut. However, his best finishes also helped Renault win back-to-back Constructors&#x27; titles from 2005 to 2006.

Outside of Formula One, Fisichella has driven for AF Corse at various sportscar racing events, becoming a two-time class winner at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as a class winner at Petit Le Mans. Beyond driving, Fisichella founded FMS International in 2005, managing the team in the GP2 Series until 2009.

== Junior racing career ==
Like most current Formula One drivers, he began kart racing as a youngster in the Guidonia&#x27;s Kart circuit. In 1992, he competed in the Italian Formula Three Championship, racing for the RC Motorsport team. He finished runner up in 1993, and in 1994 he won the championship, following race victories in Monaco and Macau. He left open-wheel racing briefly in 1995 and 1996, driving for Alfa Romeo in the International Touring Car Championship.

== Formula One career ==
=== Minardi (1996) ===
In , he made the move to Formula One, making his debut for the Minardi team, after being the official test driver the previous season. However he did not complete the full season since Minardi required a driver who could bring funding to the team, and replaced Fisichella with Giovanni Lavaggi.

=== Jordan (1997) ===
In 1997, he made the move to Eddie Jordan&#x27;s eponymous team, where he drove alongside former F1 champion Michael Schumacher&#x27;s brother Ralf, himself a former Formula Nippon champion. Fisichella gained his first podium finish at the 1997 Canadian Grand Prix, and went on to finish higher in the points standings than his teammate. At Hockenheim, a victory looked to be within reach for Fisichella, but a puncture and the performance of an on-form Gerhard Berger denied him the win. Fisichella was able to show his talent again at the rain-soaked Belgian Grand Prix in which he finished a commendable second behind Michael Schumacher. Following this race, the Benetton team signed him for 1998.

=== Benetton (1998–2001) ===
Following Renault&#x27;s withdrawal from Formula One, Benetton would contest the 1998 season without factory-supplied engines, instead using rebranded development versions of 1997 Renault engines. Despite not having the latest engines, Fisichella still managed second places at Montreal and Monaco, and was in contention for a victory in Canada until gearbox problems slowed him down. In Austria, Fisichella scored his first pole position. However, an on-track clash with Jean Alesi during the race cost him any chance of a good result. He was then able to add only two more points to his total in the second half of the year as Benetton lost ground on their competition.

1999 proved to be a similarly inconsistent season. He did score some points finishes, including second at Montreal, and again came close to a victory in the European Grand Prix, until he spun off whilst in the lead. This would prove to be his best chance of a victory for the next few seasons.

Fisichella&#x27;s season was to follow a similar pattern in 2000. He again gained some surprise podium finishes early in the year in Brazil, Germany, Monaco, and Canada. However, Benetton&#x27;s poor second half of the season meant that he failed to score any more points. After his first Benetton year, when he finished one point behind him, Fisichella had comprehensively outperformed his Austrian teammate Alexander Wurz, who would then leave the team to make way for British driver Jenson Button in 2001. Renault had purchased the Benetton team after the start of the 2000 season, but their radical engine design meant Benetton had an uncompetitive 2001 car, and as a result, Fisichella was battling for much of the season with teams such as Minardi and Prost. However, the efforts of technical director Mike Gascoyne and his staff did result in improvements over the year, culminating in a 4–5 finish at the German Grand Prix and a third-place finish for Fisichella at the Belgium race. Although Fisichella had gained the team&#x27;s best results that season and consistently outperformed Button, he was not retained by the team, so he rejoined Jordan for 2002.

=== Return to Jordan (2002–2003) ===

Fisichella scored seven points in 2002, while comfortably outpacing new teammate Takuma Sato, although the Jordan-Honda car of that year was never truly competitive. After Honda withdrew their engine supply, Jordan switched to Ford engines for the 2003 season, but the team were still unable to compete with the top teams on the grid. Despite this lack of performance, Fisichella won his first race at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Battling with McLaren&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen amidst heavy rain and numerous crashes, Fisichella took the race lead on lap 54, just before the race was red-flagged. However, he was demoted to second place on the podium, because under the regulations, the race results were declared at two laps before the red flag, at which point Räikkönen was thought to have been the race leader. Several days later, though, the FIA determined that Fisichella had already begun his 56th lap before the red flag, meaning that he, and not Räikkönen, had been leading the race two laps before its premature end, awarding the Italian his first F1 victory, and he became the only F1 driver to have won a race without having stood atop the podium. He collected the winner&#x27;s trophy at the next race at Imola. Fisichella&#x27;s only other points finish of 2003 was to be a seventh place at Indianapolis.

=== Sauber (2004) ===

Unhappy with the Jordan team&#x27;s performance, Fisichella moved to Sauber in 2004 in the hope of greater results, and using the team as a way of gaining access to drive for the 2003 World Champions Ferrari, who supplied re-badged engines to the Sauber team. Fisichella drove well all year, comfortably outpacing teammate Felipe Massa for much of the season (scoring 22 championship points vs Massa&#x27;s 12).

=== Renault (2005–2007) ===
==== 2005 ====

His strong performances prompted his former Benetton-Renault team boss Flavio Briatore to re-sign him for the 2005 season as partner to the young Spanish driver Fernando Alonso. A win at the season opening race at Melbourne signalled the Formula One breakthrough that commentators had been predicting, but it proved to be something of a false dawn. A run of poor luck saw Fisichella fall behind his teammate in the championship standings, and at times the pair were achieving noticeably different lap times with the same equipment. It appeared that Fisichella simply did not have the pace to match Alonso.

The difference in pace between Fisichella and Alonso was noticeable, and while Alonso&#x27;s metronomic consistency helped him win the championship, Fisichella&#x27;s general bad luck was to cost him points finishes. He was overtaken and lost the lead on the final lap of the Japanese Grand Prix by McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen, despite his race engineer urging him to avoid letting Räikkönen past, which earned him heavy criticism from the press. Nevertheless, his performances alongside Alonso throughout the season enabled Renault to win the World Constructors&#x27; Championship ahead of McLaren and Ferrari, the latter of which had won that title the previous six seasons.

==== 2006 ====

2006 proved to be a similar season for Fisichella. Having won in Malaysia, putting in a strong performance to win from the pole position. However, he failed to maintain that pace for the upcoming races and even failed to reach the top ten in qualifying for two races. This form, in addition to a penalty in Monaco for allegedly impeding David Coulthard, meant Fisichella was again unable to challenge his teammate Alonso for the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Some strong results in the second half of the 2006 season, including finishing ahead of Alonso at the US Grand Prix, enabled Fisichella to obtain his best results: Fourth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 72 points, one win, and five podium finishes. After finishing third in Japan, Fisichella dedicated the result to his best friend, Tonino Visciani, who died of a heart attack on the Thursday before the race. Nevertheless, he was able to get a sixth-place finish in Brazil to secure the Constructors&#x27; title for Renault.

==== 2007 ====
In 2007, Fisichella became Renault&#x27;s lead driver after the departure of Fernando Alonso. His teammate was the team&#x27;s former test driver, the young Finn Heikki Kovalainen, who was replaced as test driver by Nelson Piquet Jr.

Renault did not demonstrate the same level of pace as in previous seasons, which had seen them win successive World Championships. It remains unclear whether the difference was due to the change of tyre supplier from Michelin to Bridgestone, the driving abilities of Fernando Alonso, or simply being outpaced in off-season development by the other top teams. Another possibility is that the team&#x27;s wind tunnel was giving inaccurate data in late 2006 which affected the development of the 2007 car. In the early races, Fisichella obtained better results than rookie teammate Kovalainen, but in Canada and the United States, it was the Finn who claimed the higher finishes. Fisichella was disqualified from the Canadian Grand Prix, along with Ferrari&#x27;s Felipe Massa, for exiting the pit lane while the traffic light was showing red, the purpose of which is to prevent cars rejoining the race ahead of the safety car. He later stated that he had been busy avoiding other cars in the pit lane and had simply not noticed the red light. The Renault team seemed to have made significant progress in terms of pace by the Spanish Grand Prix, but a series of fuel rig problems meant that neither driver was able to capitalise on this apparent increase in performance. Fisichella crashed into the Super Aguri of Anthony Davidson in Hungary which broke his rear suspension and forced him to retire.

=== Force India (2008–2009) ===
==== 2008 ====
With Renault signing Fernando Alonso and Nelson Piquet Jr. Fisichella was announced as the number one driver alongside Adrian Sutil for the Force India F1 team for the season (This was the third stint for Fisichella at the former Jordan team) on 10 January 2008. In the 2008 Monaco Grand Prix, he became the 9th driver to join the &#x27;200&#x27; club for drivers to have competed in at least 200 Grands Prix.

Fisichella finished the season pointless, as did the Force India team. However, there were a few moments when he found himself in the points position, such as the Brazil, where an early change to soft compound tyres and his wet-weather ability saw him climb as high as fifth. On 17 October, Force India announced they would keep Fisichella for the 2009 season.

==== 2009 ====

With the new Force India VJM02 powered by a Mercedes-Benz engine, Fisichella qualified 18th (promoted to 15th after both Toyotas and Lewis Hamilton were demoted) on the grid for the 2009 curtain-opener at Australia. He finished 11th in the race itself. In Malaysia, he qualified 18th, and was classified in the same position, having spun off in the torrential rain that stopped the race on lap 33.

On 29 August, making the most of some very effective technical upgrades from Force India, Fisichella recorded the team&#x27;s first pole position at the Belgian Grand Prix. He went on to score Force India&#x27;s first points and earn them their first podium in Formula One with a strong second-place finish behind Ferrari&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen.

During that weekend, there were rumours that Fisichella might replace fellow Italian Luca Badoer (who was himself replacing the injured Felipe Massa) and become a Ferrari driver, something that he admitted he always wanted to do. On 3 September 2009, an official press statement confirmed Fisichella would be released from Force India to drive for Ferrari at the Italian Grand Prix, his home race.

=== Ferrari (2009) ===

Fisichella signed a contract as Ferrari&#x27;s driver for the remainder of the 2009 season and reserve driver for 2010 on 3 September 2009. However, he had not ruled out continuing to race for another team in 2010, saying &quot;if there is a good option to find another seat in another team it would be good&quot;. Beginning with the 2009 Italian Grand Prix, he replaced the injured Felipe Massa for the remainder of the 2009 season.

Fisichella remained Ferrari&#x27;s reserve driver for but had been keen to keep racing for a different team. He admitted that Sauber was a strong option and was strongly linked to the team, however his hopes of driving for Sauber in 2010 were ended when Pedro de la Rosa was confirmed as the team&#x27;s second driver. He was also linked to a possible return to Force India but the team confirmed former teammate Adrian Sutil and fellow Italian Vitantonio Liuzzi. As a result, he remained one of Ferrari&#x27;s test drivers for along with fellow Italian Luca Badoer, Spaniard Marc Gené, Frenchman Jules Bianchi and Italian MotoGP rider Valentino Rossi.

At the end of 2010, Fisichella along with Luca Badoer and Marc Gené was replaced by Jules Bianchi as Ferrari test driver ahead of the 2011 season. However he remains a part of the Italian team and attended their annual &#x27;Wroom&#x27; media event at Madonna di Campiglio in January 2011.

=== Helmet ===
Fisichella&#x27;s helmet was white with a yellow stripe running above the visor and dropping to a &quot;v&quot; at the back of the head, and a green stripe below the visor that came to a peak on the back of the head, intersecting the yellow stripe and forming an X on each side of the back of the head, with blue squares replacing the points of intersection; on top there was a blue droplet shape with the point facing backwards to meet the apex of the green line. In 2004, silver and chrome flames were incorporated in the design by Fisichella&#x27;s then painter, Carsten Meurer of MRC Design. In 2007, Barney Stinton, part of Fisichella&#x27;s management team incorporated the Italian colours into the design and the helmet was realised by Jens Munser of JMD, a design he uses to this day. Whilst at Renault it featured a light blue ring. Once at Ferrari, his helmet turned black and grey.

In 2004, whilst racing for Sauber, Fisichella became the first driver in Formula 1 to have his HANS device painted in his colours, Massa followed soon after and then the rest of the grid had theirs painted.

== After Formula One ==
=== Sports car racing ===
Fisichella made his sports car racing debut in 2010 by driving for AF Corse in a Ferrari F430 in the Le Mans Series as well as briefly in the American Le Mans Series as part of the Ferrari deal he signed in mid-2009.

In 2011, Fisichella, co-driver Gianmaria Bruni, and team AF Corse won both the driver&#x27;s and team&#x27;s championships in the LM GTE Pro class of the Le Mans Series, by finishing second at Le Mans and won the 1000 km of Spa and helped AF Corse win the team&#x27;s championship in the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup.

In 2012, Fisichella was again with AF Corse and took part in the 2012 World Endurance Championship He won the season opener and came second in Spa.

In the 80th edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2012, Fisichella and the AF Corse Team scored first place in the GTE-Pro class along with his co-drivers Toni Vilander and Gianmaria Bruni; their Ferrari 458 Italia covered a total of 335 laps (2,845.53 miles), of the Circuit de la Sarthe. Fisichella had the honor of driving the last stage of the competition. After a difficult 2013 Fisichella moved to the TUSCC Series in America to race for Risi Competizione but returned to AF Corse and teammates Bruni and Vilander for the 2014 edition the Le Mans 24hrs. After a hard-fought race, they emerged victorious covering 339 laps, 4 more than their 2012 win tally. Fisichella then returned to America and won at Road America and Virginia International Raceway, he currently lies 8th in the GT Le Mans standings.

=== Open-wheel racing ===
In 2022, Fisichella competed in one round and 3 races at the Adelaide 500 in the S5000 category. &quot;I am thrilled to be coming back to Australia to race S5000 – at last,&quot; he stated. &quot;My Formula 1 career started literally a few weeks after the last F1 race in Adelaide. I have never driven on the circuit, which is now a slightly shorter version of the GP track. I expect the S5000 car will be fast there, and I&#x27;m thrilled to be driving with Team BRM, which has a great record in racing in Australia.&quot;

== Other ventures ==
Outside of driving, he has backed his own GP2 team, FMS International.

<text>The Rally for the Republic – Republican Party of Czechoslovakia (, abbreviated to Republikáni or SPR–RSČ) is a minor political party in the Czech Republic, strongly opposed to the EU, NATO and immigration. The party and its leader Miroslav Sládek are particularly known for their radical attitudes towards Roma people (antiziganism) and Germans.

==History==
The party was founded on December 30, 1989 as one of the first political parties in post-communist Czechoslovakia. It peaked in the 1996 Czech legislative election with 8% of the vote (485,072 electors, 18 seats in the 200-seat Chamber of Deputies) but declined after that, and in 2001 disbanded due to financial irregularities – specifically the theft of party funds by the chairman, who used the money to fund his luxury lifestyle.

The party was reestablished in 2001 as Republicans of Miroslav Sládek (RMS, &quot;Republikáni Miroslava Sládka&quot;). Sládek immediately set up a new party; to distinguish it from the other &quot;republican&quot; parties his name was added. The new party failed to attract a significant number of votes (0.9% during 2002 Czech legislative election was the highest). For the 2006 elections RMS joined with the National Party, which obtained 0.1% of votes. The number of active members was estimated to be in the dozens at most.

On May 17, 2008 this new party merged with five other minor parties to form the SPR–RSČ. The renewed party chose Sládek as chairman, yet even after the merger the party failed to gain political traction. For non-compliance with statutory obligations, the Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic (acting on a Czech government proposal) decided in December 2010 to temporarily suspend the Republican party&#x27;s activities. Finally, on 15 May 2013, the Court ordered its complete dissolution.

The party was reestablished once again in February 2016 under the name Rally for the Republic – Republican Party of Czechoslovakia 2016.

<doc id="636957" wikidata="Q1240093" url="?curid=636957" title="Pravastatin">
<text>Pravastatin, sold under the brand name Pravachol among others, is a statin medication, used for preventing cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and treating abnormal lipids. It is suggested to be used together with diet changes, exercise, and weight loss. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include joint pain, diarrhea, nausea, headaches, and muscle pains. Serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis, liver problems, and diabetes. Use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Like all statins, pravastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol.
Pravastatin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1989. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 37th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 16million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Pravastatin is primarily used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels.

Pravastatin has been found to have a similar effectiveness at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as fluvastatin but evidence indicates that pravastatin may not be as effective as other statin medications. The beneficial effect of pravastatin is dependent on the dose and the potential for side effects or unwanted effects from this medication are not clear from clinical trials.

==Adverse effects and contraindications==
Pravastatin has undergone over 112,000 patient-years of double-blind, randomized trials using the 40 mg, once-daily dose and placebos. These trials indicate pravastatin is well tolerated and displays few noncardiovascular abnormalities in patients.

Contraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with pravastatin, include pregnancy and breastfeeding. Taking pravastatin while pregnant could lead to birth defects. While the amount of pravastatin ingested by an infant from breastfeeding is low, patients breastfeeding should not take pravastatin due to potential effects on the infant&#x27;s lipid metabolism.

==Drug interactions==
Medications that should not be taken with pravastatin include, but are not limited to:
* Cimetidine (Tagamet)
* Colchicine (Colcrys)
* Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune)
* Ketoconazole (Nizoral)
* Additional cholesterol-lowering medications such as: fenofibrate (Tricor), gemfibrozil (Lopid), cholestyramine (Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar), and niacin (nicotinic acid, Niacor, Niaspan);
* Specific HIV protease inhibitors such as: lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra), and ritonavir (Norvir) taken with darunavir (Prezista); and spironolactone (Aldactone).

The combination of fenofibrate with pravastatin is approved for use in the European Union.

==Mechanism of action==
Pravastatin acts as a lipoprotein-lowering drug through two pathways. In the major pathway, pravastatin inhibits the function of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. As a reversible competitive inhibitor, pravastatin sterically hinders the action of HMG-CoA reductase by occupying the active site of the enzyme. Taking place primarily in the liver, this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the rate-limiting step of the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. Pravastatin also inhibits the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins, which are the precursor to low-density lipoproteins (LDL). These reductions increase the number of cellular LDL receptors, thus LDL uptake increases, removing it from the bloodstream.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Oral bioavailability of pravastatin ranges from 17-34% with peak plasma concentration achieved 1-1.5 hours after administration. Absorption of drug is modestly decreased when taken with food however this does not reduce the clinical lipid-lowering effect.

The 3α-hydroxyisomeric metabolite of pravastatin is also an active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with approximately 2.5-10% the potency of the parent compound. Pravastatin has a plasma half-life of 1.8 hours whereas this active metabolite has a half-life up to 77 hours.

==History==
Initially known as CS-514, pravastatin is a derivative of ML236B (compactin), which was identified in a fungus called &quot;Penicillium citrinum&quot; in the 1970s by researchers of the Sankyo Pharma Inc. It is being marketed outside Japan by the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 2005, Pravachol was the 22nd-highest selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales totaling $1.3 billion.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved generic pravastatin for use in the United States in April 2006. Generic pravastatin sodium tablets were manufactured by Biocon Ltd, India and Teva Pharmaceuticals in Kfar Sava, Israel.

<text>Conwy Bay (Welsh &quot;Bae Conwy&quot;), also known as Conway Bay, is an inlet of the Irish Sea. It is situated at the southeastern point of the coast of Anglesey at Bangor on the northern central coast of Wales, stretching from Puffin Island to Great Orme in the northeast. Bangor, Penmaenmawr, Beaumaris and Llandudno are notable towns on the bay. With its onshore winds and ebbing tide, the bay is popular with yachtsmen; Conwy Yacht Club hosts an annual regatta in June.

==Description==

Conwy Bay lies at the southeastern point of the coast of Anglesey at Bangor on the northern central coast of Wales. Puffin Island and the Great Orme mark the limits of the bay. The bay is entered between Trwyn-du and Great Ormes Head in the northeast and extends for approximately to the southwest at Bangor, marking the northeast entrance to the Menai Strait.

Bangor, Penmaenmawr and Beaumaris lie on the bay, with Llandudno to the eastern extreme. The River Conwy flows into Conwy Bay in the southeast, while the Menai Strait in the west connects it to Caernarfon Bay.

The coastline at both sides of the bay is low. A considerable area of the bay is characterised by drying sands, the Dutchman Bank and Lavan Sands being the most prominents banks. To the west of the entrance at Great Ormes Head is the Four Fathom Bank, a shallow area with depths of under , though the dry Conwy Sands dominate much of the estuary area in the eastern part of the bay between Great Ormes Head and Penmaen-bach Point, to the south. to the east of Penmaen-bach Point is the entrance to the Conwy River. The outer estuary of the Conwy in the southeastern corner of Conwy Bay is marked by &quot;extensive sandbanks, mudflats and mussel beds&quot;, and is an important habitat for birds such as dunlin, oystercatcher, curlew and redshank.

==Water sports==
With its strong onshore winds and ebbing tide, the bay is popular with yachtsmen. The bay is home to several yacht and boating clubs. Conwy Yacht Club hosts an annual regatta in June, in preparation for the Conwy River Festival in July.

<doc id="636959" wikidata="Q132560103" url="?curid=636959" title="Deductible">
<text>In an insurance policy, the deductible (in British English, the excess) is the amount paid
out of pocket by the policy holder before an insurance provider will pay any expenses. In general usage, the term &quot;deductible&quot; may be used to describe one of several types of clauses that are used by insurance companies as a threshold for policy payments.

Deductibles are typically used to deter the large number of claims that a consumer can be reasonably expected to bear the cost of. By restricting its coverage to events that are significant enough to incur large costs, the insurance firm expects to pay out slightly smaller amounts much less frequently, incurring much higher savings. As a result, insurance premiums are typically cheaper when they involve higher deductibles. For example, health insurance companies offer plans with high premiums and low deductibles, or plans with low premiums and high deductibles. One plan may have a premium of $1,087 a month with a $6,000 deductible, while a competitive plan may have a premium of $877 a month with a $12,700 deductible. The consumer with the $6,000 deductible will have to pay $6,000 in health care costs before the insurance plan pays anything. The consumer with the $12,700 deductible will have to pay $12,700.

Deductibles are normally provided as clauses in an insurance policy that dictate how much of an insurance-covered expense is borne by the policyholder. They are normally quoted as a fixed quantity and are a part of most policies covering losses to the policy holder. The insurer then becomes liable for claimable expenses that exceed this amount (subject to the maximum sum claimable indicated in the contract). Depending on the policy, the deductible may apply per covered incident, or per year. For policies where incidents are not easy to delimit (health insurance, for example), the deductible is typically applied per year.

Several deductibles can be set by the insurer based on the cause of the claim. For example, a single housing insurance policy may contain multiple deductible amounts for loss or damage arising from theft, fire, natural calamities, evacuation, etc.

There are also deductible reimbursement programs that reimburse a deductible in the event of an automobile, home, boat/yacht or health insurance claim.

== Difference from franchise ==
A deductible should not be confused with a franchise. A deductible represents a part of the expense for which the insurer is not liable, but the franchise is a pure threshold beyond which liability for the entire expense is transferred to the insurer. For example, with a franchise of $20,000, a claim of $19,900 is borne entirely by the policyholder, and a claim of $20,100 is borne entirely by the insurer.

== Difference from excess ==
An excess can refer to one of two very different insurance terms.

Excess post-hospitalization is the extra costs borne by the insured over the maximum coverage that the insurance company pays. This terminology is especially common in areas of insurance sensitive to loss (like liability insurance) and is addressed by the insurance market through excess line insurance companies through mechanisms such as excess insurance, gap insurance, and umbrella insurance.

Excess pre-hospitalization is an insurance exception that is often interchangeably but wrongly referred to also as an excess or a deductible. It is &quot;the first amount of the claim which the insured has to bear. If the insured has an excess of $500 and the total repair costs $3,000, then the insured has to pay $500 while the insurer pays the remaining $2,500.&quot;

Note that this different meaning does not apply to the British meaning of the term.

== Automobile and property insurance ==
In a typical automobile insurance policy, a deductible applies to claims arising from damage to or loss of the policyholder&#x27;s own vehicle whether the damage or loss is caused by accidents for which the holder is responsible or by vandalism or theft. Depending on the policy, the deductible may differ by the type of expense incurred that triggers the insurance claim.

Third-party liability coverages including auto liability, general liability, garage keepers, inland marine, professional liability and workers compensation are also written with deductibles. the deductibles on commercial liability policies are known as third-party deductibles or liability deductibles. Because the insured and claimant are not the same entity, insurers cannot pay the claim minus the deductible. That creates a receivable owed from the insured to the insurer. The complexity of identifying these third-party deductible receivables often causes many to be missed by the insurer and millions of dollars to go uncollected.

An insured has the option to accept an appearance allowance that can be used towards their deductible. Appearance allowances help manage repair costs by allowing for the insured to choose not to fix expensive parts that have minor damage and using the money towards their deductible.

== Health and travel insurance ==

Most health insurance policies and some travel insurance policies have deductibles as well. The type of health insurance deductibles can also vary, as individual amounts and family amounts.

The nature of medical treatment makes the insured often face multiple medical expenses spread over several days for a single illness or injury. Therefore, health insurance deductibles often tend to be imposed on a term basis (e.g. annually), rather than a per visit threshold. However, major medical insurance policies may have a per visit excess, which often does not cover the cost of routine visits to a GP unless it is certified to be a part of a continuous treatment, and the bills can be collated in a single claim.

<text>Southwestern Christian College (SwCC) is a private historically black Christian college in Terrell, Texas.

==History==
SwCC was founded in 1948 by the educator and minister G. P. Bowser under the name Southern Bible Institute in Fort Worth, Texas. The initial class consisted of 45 students. 

School officials intended to buy property in Fort Worth to erect a permanent school plant. In the summer of 1949, the school had the opportunity to purchase the property of the closed Texas Military College in Terrell. It relocated to the campus that fall, changing the college&#x27;s name. The first President was E.W. McMillan from 1950 to 1953, having H.L. Barber (1953-1956) and A.V. Isbell (1956-1967) succeeding him. The fourth president was Jack Evans, Sr, the first black and longest-serving president in the school&#x27;s history. His tenure was from 1967 to 2017. He was one of the longest-serving college presidents in the United States. The current president is Ervin D. Seamster, Jr.

The campus includes two locally significant historic buildings:
*The first dwelling erected in Terrell, an octagonal-shaped house designed to provide better defense against Indian attacks. (Built by the first Terrell in town, it was called a &quot;Round House.&quot;) The house was fitted with the first glass windows in Kaufman County, Texas. It is one of only 20 surviving Round Houses in the entire nation.
*the Administration Building, which originally housed all of the Texas Military College. It burned down in 2008. W.B. Toone built the house. His wife was born to a family who lived in the Terrell Round House.

SwCC became accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1973. It is accredited to award associate and bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

==Athletics==
SwCC participates in the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Region 5 as a Division I program.

SwCC participates in volleyball, basketball (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), and track (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s). The school colors are blue and white and the school mascot is the ram.

<doc id="636961" wikidata="Q582014" url="?curid=636961" title="St Catherine's Island">
<text>St Catherine&#x27;s Island () is a small tidal island linked to Tenby in Pembrokeshire, Wales, by Castle beach at low tide. The island, which is known colloquially as St Catherine&#x27;s Rock, is the location of St Catherine&#x27;s Fort.

==History==
The Earl of Pembroke (previously Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry VII), owned St Catherine&#x27;s Island until the reign of Elizabeth I. Later, ownership passed to the Corporation of Tenby, which took possession of a number of crown lands. It is recorded in 1856 that a few sheep inhabited the island. An observer described them as &quot;half wild sure footed creatures that run, turn and look, run again and leap from crag to crag almost with the agility of the Alpine Chamois&quot;.

For many centuries a tiny church was the only building on the island. The construction of St Catherine&#x27;s Fort in 1867 necessitated the demolishing of the remains of the church.

A family trust has owned the island since 1962. The island operated as a zoo from March 1968 to 1979. In April 2014 the island was opened to the public for visits and tours. It was closed from Saturday 27 August 2016 to 12 April 2017 and remains open to the public as of 2019.

In 2016 &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, the third and last episode of the fourth series of the BBC TV series &quot;Sherlock&quot; was filmed on the island, with it standing in as a maximum security prison.

==Geography==
Formed from an outcrop of limestone, on average 25m high, the island is riddled with tidal caves. The island is approximately long and wide.

The area below the high waterline at St Catherine&#x27;s Island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The stretch directly in front of the island is known as the Catterns.

<doc id="636977" wikidata="Q131102" url="?curid=636977" title="Segnosaurus">
<text>Segnosaurus is a genus of therizinosaurid dinosaur that lived in what is now southeastern Mongolia during the Late Cretaceous, about 102–86 million years ago. Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the Gobi Desert in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species Segnosaurus galbinensis were named. The generic name &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; means &quot;slow lizard&quot; and the specific name &quot;galbinensis&quot; refers to the Galbin region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.

&quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was a large-bodied therizinosaur that is estimated to have been about long and to have weighed about . It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot—apart from therizinosaurs, all theropods had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The pubic bone was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.

The affinities of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an infraorder, Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a junior synonym of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when browsing, and large guts for processing food. &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; is known from the Bayan Shireh Formation, where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; and &quot;Enigmosaurus&quot;; these related genera were probably niche partitioned.

==History of discovery==
In 1973, a joint Soviet–Mongolian expedition investigating the Bayan Shireh Formation at the Amtgay locality in the Gobi Desert of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown dinosaur. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically described in 1979 by the paleontologist Altangerel Perle, who named the new genus and species &quot;Segnosaurus galbiensis&quot;. The generic name is derived from the Latin word &quot;segnis&quot; (&quot;slow&quot;) and the Ancient Greek &quot;sauros&quot; (&quot;lizard&quot;). The specific name refers to the Galbin region of the Gobi Desert.

The holotype specimen from the Amtgay locality is housed at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences under the specimen number IGM 100/80 (Mongolian Institute of Geology, formerly GIN). It includes the (lower jaws), an incomplete , a complete and (lower arm bones), of the fingers, a forelimb (claw bone), an almost-complete , an incomplete right , six , ten from the front of the tail, fifteen from the hindmost part of the tail, the first , and fragments of the dorsal ribs. Two more specimens were designated as paratype specimens; specimen IGM 100/82 from the Khara Khutul locality includes a femur, and (leg bones), and , five toe phalanges including a foot ungual, rib fragments, complete , the upper portion of an , and the lower portion of a . Specimen IGM 100/83 includes a left (shoulder girdle), a radius, an ulna, forelimb unguals, and a fragment of a (neck) vertebra. In 1980, Perle and the paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold assigned another specimen to &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;; IGM 100/81 from the Amtgay locality included a left tibia and fibula.

In 1983, Barsbold listed additional specimens GIN 100/87 and 100/88. In 2010, however, the paleontologist Lindsay E. Zanno suggested these may refer to paratypes IGM 100/82 and IGM 100/83 (which had already been listed in 1979) because the Russian-to-English translation of Barsbold&#x27;s article has several typographical errors in regard to specimen numbers. Zanno also noted that by the time of her study, there were numerous problems with the &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; IGM specimens, including damage caused since collection, the disappearance of elements of the holotype, incorrect identification of assigned elements, and more than one individual bearing the same specimen number. Holotype elements Zanno was able to access in 2010 included a severely damaged ilium, a sacrum missing the left sacral ribs with damage so it could not conjoin well with the rest of the ilium, and a pubic bone and ischium missing their upper portions. More bones bearing the specimen number IGM 100/82 were located but were not mentioned in Perle&#x27;s description, while the whereabouts of some paratype elements was unknown. In a 2016 re-description of the holotype mandible, which had been little studied since 1979, Zanno and colleagues reported the majority of the tooth crowns had been damaged after collection, and most of them were missing their tips. Of the two (halves of the lower jaw), the right is nearly complete; only the hindmost part and the upper front of its mandibular symphysis (the area where the halves of the mandible meet) was missing. The left hemimandible is fragmented and preserves the front part with some displacement of bone due to crushing.

==Description==

&quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was a large-bodied therizinosaur that is estimated to have been about long and to have weighed about . Campione &amp; Evans in 2020, however, calculated its body mass at . &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; is incompletely known, but as a therizinosaurid, it would have been bipedal and robustly built with the trunk of the body tilted upwards compared to other theropods. The head would have been small with a (horny beak) at the tip of the jaws, and a long, slender neck. The fingers were not particularly long, but bore large claws. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. Therizinosaurs are known to have had simple, primitive feathers as evidenced by fossils of the basal (or &quot;primitive&quot;) genera &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;—the second-known non-bird dinosaur preserved with such integuments after &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;—and &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot;. Since most therizinosaurs are incompletely known, it is uncertain how many of the anatomical features that are used to distinguish &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; are widespread among the group; many genera cannot be directly compared because the equivalent bones are not preserved.

===Mandible and lower dentition===
The mandible of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was low and elongated, yet relatively robust and shapeless compared to that of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot;, which was more gracile. The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is long from front to back, at the highest point, and at the lowest. The , the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible&#x27;s front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end—more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30-degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; and &quot;Neimongosaurus&quot;. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is long. By comparison, the toothless region of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; was about 12% of the tooth row&#x27;s length and was almost absent in &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot;. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; gradually approached the surangular in a gentle arc.

&quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was distinct among therizinosaurs in that the hindmost part of the dentary was toothless. The teeth were restricted to the front two-thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot; but different from &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot;, in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or &quot;advanced&quot;) therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of as in &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot; and &quot;Alxasaurus&quot;, which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot;. The that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the , surangular, , and bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular. The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.
&quot;Segnosaurus&quot; had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.

The dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5–6 denticles per . The front (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2–12). Such split carinae are known from other tetanuran theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant tooth replacement, or genetic factors. Though the condition in &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.

The 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly pathological (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; replaced its teeth in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.

===Postcranial skeleton===
The (shoulder blade) of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the deltoid muscle was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed. The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than sigmoid shaped and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the entepicondyle was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to ornithomimosaurs and troodontids than to other therizinosaurs. The radius was also massive—about 60 percent of the humerus—with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer—about 70 percent of the humerus—and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was tridactyl (three-fingered). The of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.
The pelvis of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was robust and had sharply sideways-directed lobes at the front. The pelvis was shortened at the front, a feature found among bird-like theropods but uncommon among theropods as a whole. The pubic bone was directed backwards and down in parallel with the ischium; this backwards orientation of the pubic bone is known as the condition. This feature is only known from birds and their closest coelurosaurian relatives while other theropod dinosaurs had forwards-directed pubic bones. The pubic bone was elongated, flattened sideways, and had an ellipsoid projection or &quot;boot&quot; at the front of its lower end. The pelvis was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs in that the upper margin of the ilium had a pronounced overhang on the lower side and that the hindwards projecting process of the ischium was extensive, almost 50 percent of the front-to-back length of the . Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of &quot;Nothronychus&quot;, particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was distinct from that of &quot;Nothronychus&quot; in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of &quot;Enigmosaurus&quot; by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was distinct from both &quot;Nothronychus&quot; and &quot;Enigmosaurus&quot; in having a deep (a groove where the caudofemoralis brevis muscle of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.

The femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long &quot;neck&quot; and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones—four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of prosauropods, an early evolutionary grade of sauropodomorphs. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; from &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;. The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.

==Classification==
&quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (&quot;scythe reptiles&quot;), were long considered an enigmatic group. Their mosaic of features resembling those of different dinosaur groups and the scarcity of their fossils led to controversy over their evolutionary relationships for decades after their initial discovery (the forelimb elements of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; itself were originally identified as belonging to a giant turtle when described in 1954). In 1979, Perle noted the &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; fossils were possibly representative of a new family of dinosaurs, which he named Segnosauridae, &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; being the type genus and sole member. He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the &quot;meat-eating&quot; dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families Deinocheiridae and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera &quot;Deinocheirus&quot; and &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia. Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of &quot;true&quot; theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of infraorder within Saurischia, one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs—the other being Ornithischia.

In 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)—which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid—and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods—perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early—and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family. Though &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; was difficult to compare directly to &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.
In 1982, Perle reported the discovery of hindlimb fragments similar to those of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and assigned them to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, whose forelimbs had been found in almost the same location. He concluded that the Therizinosauridae, Deinocheiridae, and Segnosauridae, which all had enlarged forelimbs, represented the same taxonomic group. &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; were particularly similar, leading Perle to suggest they belonged in a family to the exclusion of Deinocheiridae (today, &quot;Deinocheirus&quot; is recognized as an ornithomimosaur). Barsbold retained &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; in the family Segnosauridae in 1983 and named the new genus &quot;Enigmosaurus&quot; based on the previously undetermined segnosaurian pelvis. The structure of the pelvis of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; was unknown but Barsbold considered it unlikely the &quot;Enigmosaurus&quot; pelvis belonged to it because &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; and &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; were so similar in other respects while the pelvis of &quot;Enigmosaurus&quot; was very different from that of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;. Barsbold found that segnosaurids were so peculiar compared to more typical theropods that they were either a very significant deviation in theropod evolution, or were possibly outside the group; he nevertheless retained them within Theropoda. Later in 1983, Barsbold stated the segnosaurian pelvis deviated significantly from the theropod norm and found the configuration of their ilia generally similar to those of sauropods.
Gregory S. Paul concluded in 1984 that segnosaurs had no theropodan features but were derived, late-surviving Cretaceous prosauropods with adaptations similar to those of ornithischians. He found segnosaurs to be similar to prosauropods in the morphology of their snout, mandible, and hindfoot; to ornithischians in their cheek, palate, pubis, and ankle; and to early dinosaurs in other respects. He proposed that ornithischians were descended from prosauropods and that the segnosaurs were an intermediate relic of this transition, which supposedly took place during the Triassic period. In this way, he considered segnosaurians to have a comparable position to herbivorous dinosaurs in general, as monotremes have to mammals. He found it unlikely but did not rule out that segnosaurs could have derived from theropods or that segnosaurs, prosauropods and ornithischians were each independently derived from early dinosaurs. David B. Norman considered Paul&#x27;s idea contentious and &quot;bound to provoke much argument&quot; in 1985. In 1988, Paul maintained that segnosaurs were late-surviving, ornithischian-like prosauropods and proposed a segnosaurian identity for &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. He also placed segnosauria within Phytodinosauria, a superorder Robert Bakker had created in 1985 to contain all plant-eating dinosaurs. In a 1986 study of the inter-relationships of saurischian dinosaurs, Jacques Gauthier concluded segnosaurs were prosauropods. While he conceded they had similarities with ornithischians and theropods, he proposed these features had evolved independently. In a 1989 conference abstract about sauropodomorph inter-relationships, Paul Sereno also considered segnosaurs to be prosauropods, based on skull features.
In a 1990 review article, Barsbold and Teresa Maryańska found Segnosauria to be a rare and aberrant group of saurischians in an unresolved position among sauropodomorphs and theropods, and probably closer to the former. Accordingly, they listed them as Saurischia &quot;sedis mutabilis&quot; (position subject to change). They agreed the hindlimbs assigned to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; in 1982 were segnosaurian but did not consider this a sufficient justification for &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; itself being a segnosaur because it was only known from forelimbs. In 1993, Dale A. Russell and Dong Zhi-Ming described the new genus &quot;Alxasaurus&quot; from China; at the time this was the most complete large theropod from its time and place. While &quot;Alxasaurus&quot; was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, &quot;Alxasaurus&quot; showed that Perle&#x27;s assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was probably correct. Russell and Dong, therefore, proposed that Segnosauridae was a junior synonym of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that &quot;Alxasaurus&quot; was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank Therizinosauroidea to contain &quot;Alxasaurus&quot; and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives. They concluded that therizinosaurs were tetanuran theropods, most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group Oviraptorosauria (because they found Maniraptora—the conventional grouping of these—invalid, and the higher-level taxonomy of theropods was in flux).

Perle and his co-authors of a 1994 redescription of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot;″s skull accepted the synonymy of Segnosauridae with Therizinosauridae and they considered therizinosaurs to have been maniraptoran theropods, the group that also includes modern birds (because they did find Maniraptora to be valid through their analysis). They also discussed the alternative previous hypotheses for therizinosaur affinities and demonstrated faults with them. In 1995, Lev A. Nessov rejected the idea therizinosaurs were theropods; he considered them a distinct group within Saurischia. In 1996, Thomas R. Holtz Jr. found therizinosaurs to group with oviraptorosaurs in a phylogenetic analysis of coelurosaurian theropods. Russell coined the name Therizinosauria for the wider group in 1997. In 1999, Xing Xu and colleagues described &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;, a small, basal therizinosaur from China, which confirmed the group belonged among the coelurosaurian theropods, and that similarities with prosauropods had evolved independently. They published the first cladogram showing the evolutionary relationships of Therizinosauria and demonstrated &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; retained features of more basal theropods and coelurosaurs, which linked them with therizinosaurs. The preservation of feather-like structures in &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; also suggested this feature was more widely distributed among theropods than previously thought.

By the early 21st century, many more therizinosaur taxa had been discovered—including some outside Asia—the first being &quot;Nothronychus&quot; from North America in 2001. Basal taxa that helped illuminate the early evolution of the group, such as &quot;Falcarius&quot; in 2005, had also been discovered. Therizinosaurs were no longer considered as rare or aberrant but more diverse in features—including size—than previously thought and their classification as maniraptoran theropods was generally accepted. The placement of Therizinosauria within Maniraptora continued to be unclear; in 2017, Alan H. Turner and colleagues found them to group with oviraptorosaurs while in 2009 Zanno and colleagues found them to be the most basal clade within Maniraptora, bracketed by Ornithomimosauria and Alvarezsauridae. Despite the additional fossil material, the interrelations within the group were also still uncertain by 2010, when Zanno conducted the most detailed phylogenetic analysis of the Therizinosauria to that point. She cited the inaccessibility, damage, potential loss of holotype specimens, scarcity of cranial remains, and fragmentary specimens with few overlapping elements as the most significant obstacles to resolving the evolutionary relationships within the group. The position of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and those of some other Asian therizinosaurids was affected by these factors; Zanno stated more well-preserved specimens and the rediscovery of missing elements would be necessary. Zanno also revised Therizinosauroidea to exclude &quot;Falcarius&quot; and retained it in the wider clade Therizinosauria, which became the senior synonym of Segnosauria. By 2015, &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; remained one of the best known therizinosaurs, according to Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues.

The following cladogram shows the relationships within Therizinosauria according to a 2013 study by Hanyong Pu and colleagues, which was based on Zanno&#x27;s 2010 analysis, with the addition of the basal genus &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot;:
The basalmost definite therizinosaur is &quot;Falcarius&quot; from the Early Cretaceous of North America; it showed the pelvis and dentition were the first features that were modified away from the more general maniraptoran plan in therizinosaurs, probably reflecting their transition from carnivory to herbivory. Therizinosaurs are mainly known from the Cretaceous of Asia and North America, and possible remains from other ages and places are controversial. Since therizinosaurs are known to have lived across the supercontinent Laurasia (which consisted of what are now North America, Europe, and Asia), Zanno suggested two scenarios for their paleobiogeographic distribution in 2010. One possibility is they dispersed through vicariance, whereby therizinosaurs were present in the areas that became Asia and North America before the rifting that divided these areas in the Late Triassic. The other possibility is that basal therizinosaurs dispersed between Asia and North America via Europe after the rifting event but before the middle Barremian; between 132 and 138 million years ago, a temporary land bridge connected North America and Europe, whereafter the landmasses were again isolated from each other, explaining why the basal therizinosaurs &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; from Asia and &quot;Falcarius&quot; from North America were so morphologically divergent from each other, though coeval. The presence of the derived therizinosaurid &quot;Nothronychus&quot;, which was most-closely related to Asian genera, in North America during the Turonian stage of the early Late Cretaceous also shows there would have been a faunal interchange between North America and Asia via a late-Early Cretaceous land bridge before that (during the Aptian/Albian), which is also seen in some other dinosaur groups.

==Paleobiology==
In 1979 and 1981, Barsbold and Perle said the short, massive metatarsus and unusually large, splayed toes indicated that &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and its relatives were not adapted for rapid locomotion, perhaps because it was not required by their lifestyle; Barsbold and Perle suggested they could have been amphibious. Barsbold and Maryańska agreed in 1990 the short, broad feet and bulky trunks of the group indicated they were slow-moving animals. Paul depicted a prosauropod-like &quot;segnosaur&quot; skeleton (a composite of various genera) in a quadrupedal posture in 1988. Based on the more complete remains of &quot;Alxasaurus&quot; and the articulation of its vertebral column, Russell concluded in 1993 that Paul&#x27;s skeletal restoration was inaccurate and that the arms of therizinosaurs were held clear off the ground. In 1995, Nessov suggested the elongated claws of therizinosaurs were used for defense against predators and that their young could have used their claws for arboreal locomotion along trunks and in tree crowns in a similar manner to sloths.

In a 2012 study of the anatomy of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; and other therizinosaurs that preserve , Stephan Lautenschlager and colleagues found these dinosaurs had well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and balance. The former two senses may have played a role in foraging, predator evasion, and social behavior. These senses were also well-developed in earlier coelurosaurs, so therizinosaurs may have inherited these traits from their carnivorous ancestors and used them for different dietary purposes. In a 2014 study of the function of therizinosaur hand claws, Lautenschlager found that these would not have been used for digging, which would have been done with the foot claws because, since as in other maniraptorans, feathers on the forelimbs would have interfered with this function. He could neither confirm nor disregard that the hand claws could have been used for defense, combat, stabilization by grasping tree trunks during high browsing, sexual display, or gripping mates during copulation. He largely ruled out that they dug burrows, due to their size.

Dinosaur eggs with embryos of the Dendroolithidae type from the Nanchao Formation of China were identified as belonging to therizinosaurs and described by Martin Kundrát and colleagues in 2007. The development of the embryos and the fact that no adults were found in association with the nests indicate that therizinosaur hatchlings were precocial (capable of locomotion from birth) and able to leave their nests to feed alone, independently of their parents. In a 2013 conference abstract, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi and colleagues reported a nesting ground of theropod dinosaurs from the Javkhlant Formation of Mongolia that contained at least 17 egg clutches within an area . Each clutch contained eight spherical eggs with rough surfaces; the eggs were in contact with each other and arranged in a circular structure with no central opening. The researchers identified the eggs as dendroolithid, and therefore therizinosaurian. Though therizinosaurs are not known from the formation, it overlies the Bayan Shireh Formation where &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;, &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Enigmosaurus&quot; were found. The multiple clutches indicate some therizinosaurs were colonial nesters like hadrosaurs, prosauropods, titanosaurs, and birds. The eggs were found in a single stratigraphic layer, suggesting the dinosaurs nested at the site on a single occasion and did not exhibit site fidelity (always returning to the same site to breed).

===Diet and feeding===
The unusual features of therizinosaurs have led to several interpretations of their feeding behavior; there is no direct evidence of their diet, such as stomach contents and feeding traces. In 1970, Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky suggested &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;—the only member of the group known at the time—used its large claws to open termite mounds or gather fruits from trees. Barsbold and Perle pointed out in 1979 and 1980 that their peculiar features probably reflected a different evolutionary direction than those of more typical theropods, many of which were considered effective, active predators. Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food but could have preyed on fish. In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory. In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could, therefore, crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food. Norman stated in 1985 the possibility &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was an aquatic fish-eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.
In 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory. In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have &quot;sat&quot; on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct chalicotheres and ground sloths, as well as gorillas, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs. Because therizinosaur remains are often found in sediments deposited in river and lake environments, Russell said they may have browsed on riparian bushes and trees. Based on the assemblage of fossils in the Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan, Nessov suggested in 1995 that therizinosaurs could have been part of its nutrient-rich aquatic ecosystems, though perhaps indirectly, by feeding on wasps which had themselves fed on carrion of aquatic vertebrates. He found this consistent with Rozhdestvensky&#x27;s suggestion that therizinosaurs may have fed on social insects. In a 2006 conference abstract, Sara Burch presented the inferred range of motion in the arms of the therizinosaur &quot;Neimongosaurus&quot; and concluded the overall motion at the -humeral joint at the shoulder was roughly circular, and directed sideways and slightly downwards, which diverged from the more oval, backwards-and-downwards-directed ranges of other theropods. This ability to extend their arms considerably forwards may have helped therizinosars reach and grasp for foliage.

In 2009, Zanno and colleagues stated therizinosaurs were the most-widely regarded candidates for herbivory among theropods and listed features associated with this diet. These included small, densely packed, coarse serrations; lanceolate (lance-shaped) teeth with a low replacement rate; a beak at the front of the jaws; an inset tooth row that suggests fleshy cheeks; an elongated neck; a small skull; a very large gut capacity as indicated by the rib circumference at the trunk and the outwards flaring processes of the ilia; and the loss of cursorial (related to running) adaptations in the hind limbs, including development of functionally tetradactyl feet. Zanno and colleagues found the clades at the base of Maniraptora—Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria—had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans. Zanno and Peter J. Makovicky found, in 2011, therizinosaurs and some other groups of herbivorous dinosaurs that had beaks and retained teeth were unable to lose their teeth completely because they lacked gastric mills (gizzards) and needed the teeth to process food, and that the high-fiber folivorous (leaf-based) diet of therizinosaurs and other archosaurs may also have precluded the evolution of a complete beak. Lautenschlager found in 2014 the hands of therizinosaurs would have had to be able to extend the range of the animal to a point that could not be reached by the head if they were used for browsing and pulling down vegetation. In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.
Zanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of omnivory and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; and the enlargement of denticles in &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;. Zanno and colleagues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;, including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of sympatric therizinosaur species—related species that lived in the same area at the same time—it is possible niche partitioning between them could have played a role in the group&#x27;s evolutionary success. This is supported by &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.

In a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs—typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors—had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.

In 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards. While the larger gut associated with herbivory was able to push the shaft backwards, they suggested the pubic boot was restrained by ventilatory muscles that were crucial for cuirassal ventilation—breathing with extra air sacs—which shows the importance of this mode of respiration. In a 2019 study of jaw musculature, Ali Nabavizadeh concluded therizinosaurs were mainly orthal feeders—moving their jaws up and down—and raised their jaws isognathously whereby the upper and lower teeth of each side occluded (contacted each other) at once. The origin and insertion sites of their jaw muscles also added strength to their jaw closure. David J. Button and Zanno found in 2019 herbivorous dinosaurs mainly followed two distinct modes of feeding, either processing food in the gut—characterized by gracile skulls and low bite forces—or the mouth, characterized by features associated with extensive processing. &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;, along with diplodocoid and titanosaur sauropods, deinocheirid and ornithomimid ornithomimosaurs, and caenagnathids, was found to be in the former category, whereas &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; was more similar to some sauropodomorph and ornithischian taxa, indicating these two therizinosaurs were functionally separated and occupied different niches.

==Paleoenvironment==

Fossils of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; have been recovered from the Bayan Shireh Formation in Mongolia, which has been dated to about 102–86 million years ago during the Cenomanian to Turonian stages of the Late Cretaceous period, based on paleomagnetic analysis and calcite U–Pb measurements. The remains were found in poorly cemented, gray sands containing intraformational conglomerates, gravel, and gray claystone. The Bayan Shireh Formation overlies the Baruunbayan Formation and underlies the Javkhlant Formation. The sediments of these formations were deposited by meandering rivers and lakes on an alluvial plain (flat land consisting of sediments deposited by highland rivers) with a semi-arid climate.

Therizinosaurs were the most abundant theropods in the Bayan Shireh Formation in terms of biodiversity; in addition to &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;, members of the group included &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot;, &quot;Enigmosaurus&quot;, and possibly a fourth type. Other theropods included the tyrannosaur &quot;Alectrosaurus&quot;, the ornithomimid &quot;Garudimimus&quot;, and the dromaeosaur &quot;Achillobator&quot;. Other dinosaurs included the ankylosaur &quot;Talarurus&quot;, the hadrosaur &quot;Gobihadros&quot;, the sauropod &quot;Erketu&quot;, and the ceratopsian &quot;Graciliceratops&quot;. Dinosaur eggs, some of which were identified as Dendroolithidae, as well as footprints of dinosaurs and crocodyliforms, have also been found. The formation is distinctive for its variety and abundance of turtles, and invertebrates include ostracods and freshwater molluscs. The Bayan Shireh Formation is possibly coeval with the Iren Dabasu Formation of the Inner Mongolia region of China, from where therizinosaur fossils similar to those of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; and &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; have also been found.

<doc id="636978" wikidata="Q1083368" url="?curid=636978" title="Mainland Finland">
<text>Mainland Finland (, ) is a term used in statistics and in other contexts to describe the continental parts of Finland, an area which excludes Åland. In legal contexts, the relation between the mainland and Åland is depicted by the word pair &quot;the State–Åland&quot; (, ).

The term &quot;mainland Finland&quot; is significant in the context of legal differences between Åland and mainland Finland, and in the context of differences of culture, language, history, and self-perceived nationhood between the Ålanders and the Swedish-speaking Finns in mainland Finland. However, since the population of Åland is only about 0.5% of that of mainland Finland, and below 10% of that of the Swedish-speaking Finns in mainland Finland, there are many instances when this distinction is ignored.

In a geographical sense the term &quot;mainland Finland&quot; can be used to exclude Finland&#x27;s other sea islands, but when distinguishing between Åland and the rest of Finland, the term encompasses those islands.

<doc id="636982" wikidata="Q2170635" url="?curid=636982" title="Rova Saxophone Quartet">
<text>Rova Saxophone Quartet is an American, San Francisco–based saxophone quartet, formed in October 1977. The name &quot;Rova&quot; is an acronym formed from the last initials of the founding members: , Larry Ochs, Andrew Voigt, and Bruce Ackley. When Voigt left in 1988, he was replaced by Steve Adams, but the group did not change the acronym.

==Music==
The quartet&#x27;s music was inspired by a broad spectrum of influences, such as John Cage, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Anthony Braxton, Steve Lacy, Charles Ives, Edgard Varése, and Olivier Messiaen. Its debut album, &quot;Cinema Rovaté&quot;, was released by Metalanguage Records in 1978. Metalanguage was founded in 1978 by Henry Kaiser and Ochs. It showcased Rova as well as many independent artists and produced the Rova Arts Festival in 1980. Rova&#x27;s tour of the Soviet Union in 1983 was filmed and shown on PBS. In 1985, it became a non-profit organization.

==Reception==
In noting Rova&#x27;s role in developing the all-saxophone ensemble as &quot;a regular and conceptually wide-ranging unit,&quot; The &quot;Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; calls its music &quot;a teeming cosmos of saxophone sounds&quot; created by &quot;deliberately eschewing conventional notions about swing [and] prodding at the boundaries of sound and space...&quot;

&quot;Jazz: The Rough Guide&quot; notes, &quot;Highly inventive, eclectic and willing to experiment, Rova [is] arguably the most exciting of the saxophone quartets to emerge in the format&#x27;s late 1970s boom.&quot;

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead is a metropolitan borough in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear, England. It includes Gateshead, Rowlands Gill, Whickham, Blaydon, Ryton, Felling, Birtley, Pelaw, Dunston and Low Fell. The borough forms part of the Tyneside conurbation, centred on Newcastle upon Tyne. At the 2021 census, the borough had a population of 196,154.

It is bordered by the local authority areas of Newcastle upon Tyne to the north, Northumberland to the west, County Durham to the south, Sunderland to the south-east, and South Tyneside to the east. The council is a member of the North East Combined Authority.

==History==
The town of Gateshead was an ancient borough, having been granted a charter in 1164 from Hugh Pudsey, the Bishop of Durham. The borough&#x27;s functions were relatively limited until 1836, when it was made a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. When elected county councils were created in 1889, Gateshead was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a county borough, independent from the new Durham County Council, whilst remaining part of the geographical county of Durham.

The modern borough of Gateshead was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, as one of five metropolitan boroughs within the new county of Tyne and Wear. The borough covered the whole area of five former districts and part of a sixth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Blaydon Urban District
*Chester-le-Street Rural District (parishes of Birtley and Lamesley only)
*Felling Urban District
*Gateshead County Borough
*Ryton Urban District
*Whickham Urban District
Aside from Gateshead, the other districts had all been lower-tier district authorities subordinate to Durham County Council prior to the 1974 reforms.

From 1974 until 1986 the borough council was a lower-tier district authority, with Tyne and Wear County Council providing county-level services. The county council was abolished in 1986, since when the borough council has provided both district-level and county-level services, as the old county borough of Gateshead had done prior to 1974. Some functions are provided across Tyne and Wear by joint committees with the other districts. The county of Tyne and Wear continues to exist as a ceremonial county for the purposes of lieutenancy, but has had no administrative functions since 1986.

==Governance==
Since 1986, Gateshead Council has provided both district-level and county-level functions, with some services being provided through joint arrangements with the other Tyne and Wear councils. In 2024 a combined authority was established covering Gateshead, County Durham, Newcastle upon Tyne, North Tyneside, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Sunderland, called the North East Mayoral Combined Authority. It is chaired by the directly elected Mayor of the North East and oversees the delivery of certain strategic functions across the area.
There is one civil parish in the borough at Lamesley, which forms an additional tier of local government for its area; the rest of the borough is unparished. Birtley was also a civil parish with a town council until it was abolished in 2006.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since the modern borough&#x27;s creation in 1974.

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Gateshead. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2002 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in May 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2004 the council has comprised 66 councillors representing 22 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four-year term of office.

The wards are:
* Birtley
* Blaydon
* Bridges (Gateshead town centre)
* Chopwell and Rowlands Gill
* Chowdene
* Crawcrook, Greenside and Clara Vale
* Deckham
* Dunston and Teams
* Dunston Hill and Whickham East
* Felling
* Heworth
* High Fell (includes Sheriff Hill)
* Lamesley
* Leam Lane Estate
* Lobley Hill and Bensham
* Low Fell
* Pelaw and Heworth
* Ryton, Crookhill and Stella
* Saltwell
* Wardley and Leam Lane
* Whickham North
* Whickham South and Sunniside
* Windy Nook and Whitehills
* Winlaton and High Spen
===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Centre on Regent Street, which was purpose-built for the council and was completed in 1987.
Prior to 1987 the council had been based at the Town Hall on West Street, which had been completed in 1870 for the old Gateshead Borough Council.

===Parliamentary constituencies===
In national government the borough contains four parliamentary constituencies, Blaydon and Consett, Gateshead Central and Whickham, Jarrow and Gateshead East and Washington and Gateshead South. The Gateshead Central and Whickham constituency is the only one wholly in Gateshead. Its MP, first elected in 2024, is Mark Ferguson (Labour). The Blaydon and Consett constituency covers the west of the borough and Birtley to the south, and has been represented since 2017 by Liz Twist, also for Labour. The Jarrow and Gateshead East constituency takes in the very eastern tip of the borough, including Pelaw. It is represented by Kate Osborne (Labour). The Washington and Gateshead South constituency is represented by Sharon Hodgson (Labour).

===Political conferences===
Gateshead has hosted two major political conferences. The first of these was Labour&#x27;s spring conference, ahead of the 2005 general election. The Conservatives also held a conference at the Sage Gateshead in March 2008. The Conservatives do not have any councillors in Gateshead and at the time only had one MP in the whole of the north east region. That conference was seen as an attempt to connect to voters in the area.

==Education==

Gateshead has a number of schools across the borough at both primary and secondary level. Results are well above average, with a number of outstanding schools. Gateshead has amongst the best primary and secondary schools in the country overall. A range of schools are present in Gateshead, including Jewish, Roman Catholic, Church of England, Methodist, and non-religious state schools. There is one independent school in the borough, Chase school in Whickham. Further independent schools can be found in Newcastle, Sunderland, and Tynedale.

Gateshead town itself has a further education college, Gateshead College, and a Jewish higher education institution, Beth Midrash Lemoroth — Jewish Teachers Training College.

==Environment==
Gateshead has a variety of landscapes, urban and industrial areas include the town itself, Whickham and Blaydon in the west, with more semi-rural and rural locations in the west including Ryton and Rowlands Gill. Overall though, it is a fairly green area with over half of the borough being green belt or countryside. Most of this is located away from built up Tyneside to the south of the borough into Derwentside/Chester-le-Street and to the west into Tynedale.

In total, there are over twenty countryside sites in the borough, from ancient meadows and woodland to local nature reserves.

Notable features of Gateshead&#x27;s countryside include Ryton Willows, found at Old Ryton Village on the banks of the Tyne at Ryton. Ryton Willows is 43 hectares of locally rare grassland and ponds located near to an affluent village with Georgian and Victorian houses. Because of this it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

The Derwent Valley, in the south/south west of the borough, offers panoramic views and pleasant walks. It was in the Derwent Valley, near Rowlands Gill, that the Northern Kites Project re-introduced red kites. This was part of a national project to introduce the birds, that were once so commonplace across the country, back into the wild. This scheme has proven to be a success, with birds being spotted across the west of the borough, from Crawcrook to Rowlands Gill itself.

The borough also contains one National Trust site, the expansive Gibside estate near Rowlands Gill, containing a stately home and a chapel, parts of its grounds have also been given SSSI status.

Even in the more urban areas of the borough, in Gateshead itself and to the east, efforts have been made to maintain green spaces and wildlife sites. One such project is Bill Quay Community Farm, east of the borough. Offering a rural experience within an urban setting, it provides an important educational tool for local schools.

==Religion==
The 2001 census stated that the borough&#x27;s predominant religion was 80.25% Christian. Other statistics found 10.94% of no religion, 6.94 unstated, 0.82% Jewish and 0.60% Muslim.

The 2011 census, stated that the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead was 67.0% Christian, 0.9% Muslim, 1.5% Jewish, 23.9% were not religious and 5.7% of the population refused to state their religion.

==Economy==
The area was once dependent on heavy industry such as steel making in the Derwent Valley and coal mining (across the borough). Shipbuilding on the Tyne was also a major source of employment. However, with the decline of these industries, Gateshead has attempted to re-invent itself. Although there are significant areas of deprivation in the borough, particularly in the centre and east, a number of towns and villages in the borough are popular with commuters and professionals who are employed in the service industry and well paid areas of the secondary sector such as engineering (which remains a major source of employment). Such commuter areas include Ryton, Rowlands Gill, Whickham and Low Fell. The borough is host to Tyne Yard, a major rail freight yard serving the North East.

Gateshead Quayside, once dominated by industry, has benefited from significant investment and gentrification in the past decade. It is now home to the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art and the Sage Gateshead.

The area is also an important retail hub, with the largest shopping centre in the European Union, and second largest in Europe as a whole, the MetroCentre, situated adjacent to the A1 trunk road. Further retail, and a significant number of engineering companies are located in the Team Valley Trading Estate, which at one time was the largest industrial estate in Europe.

==Arts and culture==
Gateshead is home to the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art and the Sage Gateshead. The Anthony Gormley structure, the &quot;Angel of the North&quot; (the largest free standing sculpture in the United Kingdom) is in Gateshead. This puts Gateshead at the forefront of the arts both regionally and nationally.

The Shipley Art Gallery, housing outstanding collections of contemporary craft, studio ceramics, paintings and decorative art, is managed by Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums on behalf of Gateshead Council. Gateshead is a library authority and within its Central Library is a large venue facility called the Caedmon Hall.

==Sports==
Gateshead has an association football team, Gateshead F.C., who play in the English . They play at the Gateshead International Stadium, which also hosts athletics.

<text>Pure Guava is the third studio album and major label debut by American rock band Ween, released on November 10, 1992, by Elektra Records. The record contains the US radio hit &quot;Push th&#x27; Little Daisies&quot;.

==Background==
The album features one of Ween&#x27;s most well-known songs, &quot;Push th&#x27; Little Daisies.&quot; The song was also released as a single on August Records in 1993, including both the album and radio edit versions of the song (the latter replacing the word &quot;shit&quot; with a sample of Prince squealing from &quot;Alphabet St.&quot;), as well as the tracks &quot;Ode to Rene&quot;, &quot;I Smoke Some Grass (Really Really High)&quot; and &quot;Mango Woman&quot;; &quot;Puerto Rican Power&quot; replaces &quot;I Smoke Some Grass&quot; on some editions.

Many of the songs on this album come from at least two tapes that the band made for friends, including ones titled &quot;Springstuff&quot; and &quot;The Caprice Classic Tape&quot;, as stated by Dean Ween on JJJ radio in 1993.

The song &quot;Big Jilm&quot; was inspired by a car dealer named James A. Lemons, who worked at the dealership owned by Dean Ween&#x27;s father.

The song &quot;Poop Ship Destroyer&quot; would become a live staple for the band, although the live performances traditionally bear little resemblance to the album version and are instead played as a protracted improvised jam, either to punish or reward an audience.

==Reception==
AllMusic editor Heather Phares called the album &quot;more polished and concise&quot; than their previous albums &quot;The Pod&quot; and &quot;&quot; and stated that &quot;Considering Elektra released it, it&#x27;s just as uncompromising as their previous work, but it hints at just how much further they could go with their music.&quot; Bill Wyman in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B+, noting that it was &quot;Very, very weird, but I can&#x27;t stop playing [it]&quot;. Robert Christgau was more negative in his &quot;Village Voice&quot; consumer guide, finding that the band wrote their &quot;fucked-up&quot; songs &quot;without thinking (and how)&quot;. He went on to disparagingly call them &quot;the kind of rec-room gigglefritzes who enjoy a good nigger joke when they&#x27;re sure their audience is sophisticated enough to enjoy it. And to be perfectly honest, I don&#x27;t hear one of those here.&quot;

Pure Guava was described as a modest commercial success. In its first 6 months of release it sold 65,000 copies. 

==Legacy==
In 1999, Ned Raggett, writing for the website &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot;, named &quot;Pure Guava&quot; the 53rd best album of the &#x27;90s, hailing it as &quot;the greatest &#x27;major label debut after an indie career&#x27; record of the decade. Not least because it was recorded in the same exact conditions and from the same exact sessions as most of said earlier indie career, so that means that Ween hit the big time with a record compiled from the outtakes that weren&#x27;t good enough for their previous album, and it&#x27;s &quot;still&quot; one of the best records ever made.&quot; The same year, German magazine &quot;Spex&quot; included the album on their list of the 100 best albums of the 20th century. Aphex Twin named it one of his 10 favorite albums of all time (making it one of two Ween albums on the list, the other being &quot;The Pod&quot;). In 1992, Faith No More covered parts of &quot;The Goin&#x27; Gets Tough From the Getgo&quot; on their &quot;Angel Dust&quot; tour.

In 2013, Andrew Earles of &quot;Spin&quot; ranked &quot;Pure Guava&quot; at number 7 in their list of the &quot;40 Weirdest Post-&quot;Nevermind&quot; Major Label Albums&quot;. He noted the presence of &quot;psychotically ill-tuned guitars, drum machines at their fartiest, sage advice not to &#x27;caress the weasel,&#x27; ballads that ignored rhythm and reason, a five-minute power-electronics suite, a few dubious sing-a-longs centered around offensive accents, and, of course, a ride on the &#x27;Poop Ship Destroyer.&#x27;&quot; In 2014, Earles listed the album in his book &quot;Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981–1996&quot;, in which he describes &quot;Pure Guava&quot; as &quot;one of the strangest albums ever to carry the logo of a major label&quot;. He also credits it as the second ever album released on a major label to be recorded wholly on an analog four-track recorder, following Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Nebraska&quot; (1982).

<text>The Social Movement Tricolour Flame (, MSFT), commonly known as Tricolour Flame (&quot;Fiamma Tricolore&quot;), is a neo-fascist political party in Italy.

==History==
The party was started by the more radical members of the Fascist Italian Social Movement, led by Pino Rauti, who refused to join the mainstream conservative party National Alliance. Rauti was later succeeded by Luca Romagnoli, who took over leadership.

In the 2004 European Parliamentary Election the party gained enough votes in the Southern constituency to elect Luca Romagnoli to the European Parliament. The party was then a member of the House of Freedoms coalition for the 2006 general election.

In the coming of the 2008 general election, Tricolour Flame formed a joint list called The Right–Tricolour Flame with The Right of Francesco Storace, a splinter group of National Alliance, in support of the candidacy of Daniela Santanchè for Prime Minister.

On 8 November 2013, Luca Romagnoli, secretary of Tricolour Flame, together with the secretary of The Right Francesco Storace, the regent of Future and Freedom Roberto Menia, the leader of I the South Adriana Poli Bortone, Domenico Nania of the association New Alliance, Oreste Tofani of the association &quot;Nazione Sovrana&quot;, Antonio Buonfiglio of the association &quot;Il Popolo della Vita&quot; and Roberto Buonasorte, editor of the online newspaper &quot;Il Giornale d&#x27;Italia&quot;, founded the Movement for National Alliance, a federation of right movements inspired to National Alliance.
On 9 December 2013 the Central Committee of Tricolour Flame distrusted Luca Romagnoli, because he joined this initiative without having preventively sought the opinion of the same Committee, and Attilio Carelli became regent Secretary of the party. After the expulsion Romagnoli founded instead his new political movement, Social Right.

On 13 and 14 December 2014, the VII National Congress officially appointed Carelli as Secretary of the party.

For the 2018 general election, it formed the Italy for the Italians coalition along with the New Force party. At 2019 European Parliamentary Election the party decides not to participate.

On 12 September 2021, the Central Committee of the party declared the Secretary Carelli officially lapsed due to the failure to present the budget for the year 2020. The same Central Committee, on 6 October 2021 conferred the mandate of Regent Secretary to Giuseppe Manoli.

On 15 and 16 January 2022, the IX National Congress took place entirely on the Zoom platform, on this occasion Daniele Cerbella was elected as National Secretary.

==Ideology==

Tricolour Flame is the party of the Italian far-right most closely tied to the legacy of Italian Social Republic (RSI). The RSI is usually seen by the party as the example of what fascism should have been, in particular as an example of true welfare state. As a sign of this legacy, the party, for example, guarantees free membership for ex-RSI military. A press release from the Rome section of the party states:
Tricolour Flame maintains a fairly strong anti-capitalist stance, and it can be thought to be the Italian party closest to third positionist ideology along with the New Force and CasaPound parties.

Recently Tricolour Flame has been peculiar, among Italian neo-fascist organizations, in actively trying to attract the young masses and renewing its political practices and communication techniques in a more modern, innovative fashion. Political manifests often tend towards attractive, modern graphics and clear-cut, even humorous slogans. Tricolour Flame is also very close to youth far-right organizations and initiatives, of which the most relevant is CasaPound, a social centre in Rome.

The party is against the regionalism promoted by the Northern League for an independent &quot;Padania&quot;, instead favoring a united Italy.

<text>Chester-le-Street was a local government district in County Durham, England. Its council was based in Chester-le-Street. Other places in the district included Great Lumley and Sacriston.

==Formation==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 as part of a general reorganisation of local administration throughout England and Wales carried out under the Local Government Act 1972. Chester-le-Street was one of eight non-metropolitan districts into which County Durham was divided, and was formed from the areas of the abolished urban district of Chester-le-Street along with the bulk of Chester-le-Street Rural District, namely the parishes of Bournmoor, Birtley (reduced in size), Edmondsley, Great Lumley, Lambton, Little Lumley, North Lodge (created from the part of Harraton outside Washington New Town), Ouston, Pelton, Plawsworth, Sacriston, South Biddick (reduced in size), Urpeth and Waldridge. The remainder of the rural district was transferred to the metropolitan boroughs of Gateshead and Sunderland, in the new county of Tyne and Wear.

==Insignia==
The district council did not have a coat of arms, but instead used the design of the chairman&#x27;s badge of office as its logo. the design consisted of a circle divided by a curved cross into four quarters. 
*In the centre of the cross was a lion, taken from the arms of the Lambton family of Lambton Castle.
*In the top left quarter was a cross of Saint Cuthbert. The saint&#x27;s remains lay in Chester for more than a century, and the town was the see of a bishop. The saint&#x27;s relics and the bishopric were subsequently transferred to Durham. The River Wear formed the background.
*In the top right quarter was a depiction of the pithead gear of a coal mine, illustrating the area&#x27;s traditional source of wealth. Behind this was shown the Chester-le-Street Viaduct
*In the bottom left quarter was a falcon, with Lumley Castle in the background.
*In the bottom right quarter was a depiction of the legendary Lambton Worm.

The emblems in the upper left and lower left quarters were subsequently altered to a bishop&#x27;s mitre and a Roman eagle standard.

==Abolition==
The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England being replaced by a new unitary authority called Durham County Council.

<doc id="636997" wikidata="Q891608" url="?curid=636997" title="Bolsover District">
<text>Bolsover District is a local government district in Derbyshire, England. It is named after the town of Bolsover, which is near the geographic centre of the district, but the council is based in the large village of Clowne to the north. The district also includes the town of Shirebrook and several villages and surrounding rural areas.

The neighbouring districts are Amber Valley, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Rotherham, Bassetlaw, Mansfield, and Ashfield.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Bolsover Urban District
*Blackwell Rural District
*Clowne Rural District
The new district was named Bolsover, after its largest town.

==Governance==
Bolsover District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Derbyshire County Council. The district is also entirely covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

Since 2014 the district has been a non-constituent member of the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority (formerly known as the Sheffield City Region); the council sends representatives to meetings of the combined authority, but the electorate of Bolsover District do not vote in elections for the Mayor of South Yorkshire.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since 2021.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019, the council has comprised 37 councillors, elected from 17 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.
===Premises===
The council is based at The Arc in Clowne, which is a combined leisure centre and council headquarters. The building was purpose-built for the council and opened in 2013. When first created the council used the former Blackwell Rural District Council&#x27;s offices in Mansfield (outside the district) as its main offices. In 1994 it moved to Sherwood Lodge on Oxcroft Lane in Bolsover, comprising a large Victorian house and modern office extensions. After the move to Clowne in 2013 Sherwood Lodge was sold. A retail development has since been built on the site.

==Media==
In terms of television, the district receives better TV signals from the Emley Moor transmitter which broadcast BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. However, southern parts of the district can still receive TV signals from the Waltham transmitter which broadcast BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. 

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Derby
*BBC Radio Sheffield (covering Bolsover)
*Greatest Hits Radio North Derbyshire
*Capital East Midlands
*Hits Radio South Yorkshire
*Mansfield Radio
*Elastic Radio

The &quot;Derbyshire Times&quot; is the weekly local newspaper that serves the district.

== Building developments ==
Following the September 2022 commercial failure of Woodhead Construction Ltd, an Edwinstowe-based business contracting to the council since 2016, and mid-way into delivering a Bolsover Homes scheme, Bolsover District Council created their own development business, Dragonfly Development Limited based at The Arc in Clowne, with the intention of fulfilling ongoing contracts and having potential to undertake entirely new construction and development works outside of the council&#x27;s normal remit.

Councillor Fritchley stated the only risks involved were &quot;calculated risks&quot;.

==Parishes==

The district is divided into 16 civil parishes. The parish councils for Old Bolsover (which covers the town of Bolsover) and Shirebrook take the style &quot;town council&quot;.
*Ault Hucknall
*Barlborough
*Blackwell (includes Hilcote, Newton and Westhouses)
*Clowne
*Elmton with Creswell
*Glapwell
*Hodthorpe and Belph
*Langwith
*Old Bolsover (town)
*Pinxton
*Pleasley
*Scarcliffe
*Shirebrook (town)
*South Normanton
*Tibshelf
*Whitwell

<doc id="637003" wikidata="Q757258" url="?curid=637003" title="Guna people">
<text>The Guna (also spelled Kuna or Cuna) are an indigenous people of Panama and Colombia. Guna people live in three politically autonomous &quot;comarcas&quot; or autonomous reservations in Panama, and in a few small villages in Colombia. There are also communities of Guna people in Panama City, Colón, and other cities. Most Guna live on small islands off the coast of the comarca of Guna Yala known as the San Blas Islands. The other two Guna comarcas in Panama are Kuna de Madugandí and Kuna de Wargandí. They are Guna-speaking people who once occupied the central region of what is now Panama and the neighboring San Blas Islands and still survive in marginal areas.

In the Guna language, they call themselves &quot;Dule&quot; or &quot;Tule&quot;, meaning &quot;people&quot;, and the name of the language is &quot;Dulegaya&quot;, literally &quot;people-mouth&quot;. The term was in the language itself spelled &quot;Kuna&quot; prior to a 2010 orthographic reform, but the Congreso General de la Nación Gunadule since 2010 has promoted the spelling &quot;Guna&quot;. 

==Political and social organization==
In Guna Yala, each community has its own political organization, led by a &quot;saila&quot; (pronounced &quot;sigh-lah&quot;). The saila is customarily both the political and religious leader of the community; he memorizes songs which relate the sacred history of the people, and in turn transmits them to the people. Decisions are made in meetings held in the Onmaked Nega, or Ibeorgun Nega (Congress House or Casa de Congreso), a structure which likewise serves both political and spiritual purposes. In the Onmaked Nega, the saila sings the history, legends, and laws of the Guna, as well as administering the day-to-day political and social affairs. The saila is usually accompanied by one or more &quot;voceros&quot; who function as interpreters and counselors for the saila. Because the songs and oral history of the Guna are in a higher linguistic register with specialized vocabulary, the saila&#x27;s recitation will frequently be followed by an explanation and interpretation from one of the voceros in informal Guna language.

Guna families are matrilinear and matrilocal, with the groom moving to become part of the bride&#x27;s family. The groom also takes the last name of the bride.

Today there are 49 communities in Guna Yala. The region as a whole is governed by the Guna General Congress, which is led by three Saila Dummagan (&quot;Great Sailas&quot;).

==Flag==

The Guna flag was adopted after the 1925 rebellion against Panamanian suppression. Horizontal stripes have a proportion of 1:2:1 and the central swastika is an ancestral symbol called Naa Ukuryaa. According to one explanation, it symbolizes the four sides of the world or the origin from which peoples of the world emerged. In another explanation, it symbolises the octopus that created the world, its tentacles pointing to the four cardinal points. Also known as the flag of Guna Yala island today, the flag was used for the province of San Blas until 2010 and also is used as the Guna ethnic flag. The central stripe, meaning peace and purity, is white on the official flag of the reservation, officially adopted by Guna National Congress, while yellow stripe is used on the ethnic flag (it was introduced on the flag at about 1940). In 1942, the flag was modified with a red ring (representing the traditional Kuna nose-ring) encompassing the center of the swastika because of Nazi associations; the ring was later abandoned.

==Culture==
The Guna are famous for their bright molas, a colorful textile art form made with the techniques of appliqué and reverse appliqué. Mola panels are used to make the blouses of the Guna women&#x27;s national dress, which is worn daily by many Guna women. &quot;Mola&quot; means &quot;clothing&quot; in the Guna language. The Guna word for a &quot;mola&quot; blouse is &quot;Tulemola,&quot; (or &quot;dulemola&quot;) &quot;Guna people&#x27;s clothing.&quot;

==Economy==

The economy of Guna Yala is based on agriculture, fishing and the manufacture of clothing with a long tradition of international trade. Plantains, coconuts, and fish form the core of the Guna diet, supplemented with imported foods, a few domestic animals, and wild game. Coconuts, called &quot;ogob&quot; in the Guna language, and lobsters &quot;skungit&quot; are the most important export products. Migrant labor and the sale of &quot;molas&quot; provide other sources of income.

The Guna have a long deep rooted history of mercantilism and a longstanding tradition of selling goods through family owned venues. Most imported goods originate from Colombian, Mexican or Chinese ships and are sold in small retail stores owned by Guna people. The Guna have not excised tax when trading goods and place strong emphasis on economic success. This tradition of trade and self-determination has been credited by many as a chief reason the Guna have been able to successfully function independently compared to other indigenous groups.

Guna communities in Panama City are typically made up of migrant laborers and small business owners, although many Guna also migrate to Panama City to sell fish and agricultural products produced by their respective communities. The sale of Mola and other forms of Guna art has become a large part of the Guna peoples economy in recent years and mola vendors can be found in most cities in Panama where they are marketed to both foreigners and Hispano Panamanians. Tourism is now an important part of the economy in the Carti region, and abandoned goods from the drug trade provide occasional windfalls.

==History==
Guna people were living in what is now Northern Colombia and the Darién Province of Panama at the time of the Spanish invasion, and only later began to move westward towards what is now Guna Yala due to a conflict with the Spanish and other indigenous groups. Centuries before the conquest, the Gunas arrived in South America as part of a Chibchan migration moving east from Central America. At the time of the Spanish invasion, they were living in the region of Uraba and near the borders of what are now Antioquia and Caldas. Alonso de Ojeda and Vasco Núñez de Balboa explored the coast of Colombia in 1500 and 1501. They spent the most time in the Gulf of Urabá, where they made contact with the Gunas.

In far-eastern Guna Yala, the community of New Caledonia is near the site where Scottish explorers tried, unsuccessfully, to establish a colony in the &quot;New World&quot;. The bankruptcy of the expedition has been cited as one of the motivations of the 1707 Acts of Union.

There is a wide consensus regarding the migrations of Gunas from Colombia and the Darien towards what is now Guna Yala. These migrations were caused partly by wars with the Catio people, but some sources contend that they were mostly due to bad treatment by the Spanish invaders. The Guna themselves attribute their migration to Guna Yala to conflicts with the aboriginal peoples, and their migration to the islands to the excessive mosquito populations on the mainland.

During the first decades of the twentieth century, the Panamanian government attempted to suppress many of the traditional customs. This was bitterly resisted, culminating in a short-lived yet successful revolt in 1925 known as the Dule Revolution (or &quot;people revolution&quot;) – led by Iguaibilikinya Nele Kantule of Ustupu and supported by American adventurer and part-time diplomat Richard Oglesby Marsh – and a treaty in which the Panamanians agreed to give the Guna some degree of cultural autonomy.

The San Blas Islands could be rendered uninhabitable by sea level rise in the late 21st century. In early 2025, the Guna community of Gardi Sugdub was evacuated from the island to a purpose built new township on the mainland due to the rising sea-level.

==Language==
The Guna language is an aboriginal American language of the Chibchan family spoken by 50,000 to 70,000 people. Dulegaya is the primary language of daily life in the &quot;comarcas,&quot; and the majority of Guna children speak the language. Although it is relatively viable, Guna is considered an endangered language.

Spanish is also widely used, especially in education and written documents.

==Health==
The Guna have been shown to have a low average blood pressure (B.P., 110/70 mm Hg), and, do not experience the age-related increase in blood pressure that is common in Western society. Death rates from cardiovascular disease (C.V.D.) and cancer – the #1 and #2 causes of death in the U.S. – are low in the Guna. Between 2000 and 2004 in mainland Panama, for every 100,000 residents, 119 died from C.V.D. and 74 died from cancer; in contrast, per 100,000 Guna, these death rates were 8 for C.V.D. and 4 for cancer.

==Albinism==

Guna people have a high incidence rate of albinism, which led to their nickname of &quot;White Indians&quot; in the early 1900s. In Guna philosophy, the albinistic people (or &quot;sipu&quot;) were given a special place and are considered a special race of people. They have the specific duty of defending the moon against a dragon which tries to eat it on occasion during a lunar eclipse, and only they are allowed to go outside on the night of a lunar eclipse and to use specially made bows and arrows to shoot down the dragon.

<text>Chocolate and Cheese is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Ween, originally released by Elektra Records in 1994. It was the first Ween album to be recorded in a professional studio, in contrast to the four-track home recordings of &quot;The Pod&quot; and &quot;Pure Guava&quot;. However, most of the instruments were still played by Dean and Gene Ween, including their drum machine.

==Background==
Ween&#x27;s previous two albums &quot;The Pod&quot; (1991) and &quot;Pure Guava&quot; (1992) had been recorded in a very lo-fi setting – the band only had access to their guitars and a four-track cassette TASCAM Portastudio; the albums were recorded in their apartment (nicknamed &quot;The Pod&quot;, hence the name of their second album). Having signed to major label Elektra Records, Ween now had access to better resources to record. In addition, drummer Claude Coleman Jr. joined the band, meaning they had live instrumentation as opposed to relying on a drum machine.

As a result, &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; ended up sounding more hi-fi than Ween&#x27;s prior works. The sound is clearer due to having been recorded digitally as opposed to the tapes that the first three albums were done on, and the resources the band now had meant they could experiment more than they did in the previous lo-fi set up.

The album is dedicated to comedian John Candy, who died while Ween was putting the album together. &quot;A Tear for Eddie&quot; was dedicated to Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist Eddie Hazel, who died in 1992. In a 2011 interview, Gene Ween credited a Spanish lesson on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; with inspiring &quot;Buenas Tardes Amigo&quot;. The album&#x27;s title is phonetically similar to the British saying &quot;chalk and cheese&quot;, a way of saying that two items have nothing in common.

==Album cover==
In an interview with Hank Shteamer during the writing of the 33⅓ book about &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot;, Dean Ween said that the original idea for the album art was to &quot;get a sailor, like a gay sailor, in red, white and blue wearing the belt&quot;, but the studio rejected this idea, thinking it was inappropriate.

Gene Ween claims to have come up with the idea for the album art that ended up being made, saying &quot;I had it sketched out... I remember telling Mickey how the top of the [shirt] would cut out right below the nipple line and so it was very important to have big breasts with a large &#x27;under portion&#x27;&quot;. The creative director of Reiner Design Consultants, Roger Gorman, stated that they were given the direction to make it look like an album cover by the Ohio Players.

The model for the album art was Ashley Savage, and photography was done by John Kuczala. In the early 2000s, the cover was voted &quot;sexiest album cover of all time&quot; by readers of Playboy.com.

==Reception and legacy==
In her review of &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; for &quot;Spin&quot;, Terri Sutton observed that Ween &quot;seems to have potty-trained its predilection for lengthy funk deconstructions&quot;, limiting their &quot;Prince/Brothers Johnson fixation&quot; to &quot;a prized few taut, sexy saunters&quot; and elsewhere exploring new musical territory by taking influence from Southern rock, Philadelphia soul, and disco, among other styles. &quot;Certifiably insane and dangerously insidious,&quot; Paul Rees wrote in &quot;Select&quot;, &quot;&quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; is the finest argument for dropping out and tuning in to Ween&#x27;s parallel universe.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Dimitri Ehrlich was more reserved in his praise, likening Ween to &quot;someone so impossibly weird it almost gives you a headache – yet you think about the things that person said for weeks&quot;. Mark Sutherland of &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; &quot;more like a trip round a very odd compilation than a proper, coherent album&quot;, advising listeners &quot;to tape the best bits and ponder on why Ween don&#x27;t just stop mucking about and record an entire album&#x27;s worth of similar gems.&quot; Robert Christgau selected &quot;Spinal Meningitis (Got Me Down)&quot; as the sole &quot;choice cut&quot; from the album in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Heather Phares lauded &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; as &quot;a brilliant fusion of pop and gonzo humor&quot; and &quot;arguably Ween&#x27;s finest moment&quot;, which &quot;proved for once and all that along with their twisted sense of humor and wide musical vocabulary, Dean and Gene are also impressive songwriters.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewer Stuart Berman wrote that it showed &quot;that when you scraped away the cruddy production and pitch-shifting chicanery that defined their previous records, Ween were undeniable pop songwriters.&quot; Rob Hughes of &quot;Uncut&quot; found that despite Ween&#x27;s many &quot;audacious stylistic turns&quot; throughout &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot;, &quot;the songs are so good they transcend notions of pastiche&quot;, concluding that the album, while sometimes crossing &quot;the limits of acceptable taste&quot;, documents the band&#x27;s &quot;sheer verve, ideas and invention&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; included &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; on its list of &quot;50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot;. The entire album was played live as part of the group&#x27;s setlist at the Desert Daze festival in California on October 12, 2019.

==Related releases==
&quot;I Can&#x27;t Put My Finger on It&quot; served as the title track of an EP released by Elektra in 1994, which also included the tracks &quot;A Tear for Eddie&quot;, &quot;Now I&#x27;m Freaking Out&quot;, and &quot;Bakersfield&quot;. The same year, &quot;Voodoo Lady&quot; was released by the New Zealand label Flying Nun Records as a 7&quot; single, with &quot;Buenas Tardes Amigo&quot; on the B-side; both songs were also issued on the &quot;Voodoo Lady&quot; EP in CD format, along with the tracks &quot;There&#x27;s a Pig&quot; and &quot;Vallejo&quot;. &quot;Freedom of &#x27;76&quot; was the title track of an EP released by Flying Nun in 1995, which included two versions of the title track plus &quot;Now I&#x27;m Freaking Out&quot; and &quot;Pollo Asado&quot;.

The first music video for the album was &quot;I Can&#x27;t Put My Finger on It&quot;, followed by &quot;Voodoo Lady&quot;, and &quot;Freedom of &#x27;76&quot;, filmed circa March 1995. CKY guitarist (and dedicated Ween fan) Chad Ginsburg appeared in the &quot;Freedom of &#x27;76&quot; promo video as an extra shouting at Gene and Dean after they stole the Liberty Bell.

&quot;Voodoo Lady&quot; can be heard in the films &quot;Road Trip&quot; and &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot;, as well as the original version of &quot;In the Bathroom&quot;, a skit from the sketch comedy show &quot;The State&quot;, while the album track &quot;Buenas Tardes Amigo&quot; was featured in the German films &quot;Lammbock&quot; and &quot;Herr Lehmann&quot;.

On top of the Elektra Records release (Elektra 61639-2 US 1994), &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; was pressed and distributed by the label Grand Royal in the US in 1994 as a 2 LP non-gatefold version (Grand Royal GR 010 US 1994). Flying Nun released two different versions in 1994, one of which came with a bonus 7&quot; single (Flying Nun Records FN314 Europe 1994, no 7&quot;) and (Flying Nun Records FNSP314 UK 1994, with 7&quot;).

Note that there is a catalog number for the vinyl issue by Elektra Records, but there is no confirmation it was pressed on vinyl at this time, possibly only in promo edition.

==Covers==
A number of songs on &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; have been covered by a variety of other artists in the years since its release.
* &quot;Roses Are Free&quot; has been covered by the band Phish 51 times between 12-11-1997 and 7-16-2022. Official releases of their version appear on Phish&#x27;s live concert albums &quot;Hampton Comes Alive&quot; (1999) and &quot;Live Phish 04.03.98&quot; (2005). The 2000 documentary &quot;Bittersweet Motel&quot; features the band learning the track backstage at the Rochester War Memorial in Rochester, NY and then transitions into their first onstage interpretation. In an interview from 2015, Melchiondo observed that Ween began playing &quot;Roses Are Free&quot; regularly in concert after Phish began covering it, and credited Phish for boosting the song&#x27;s popularity. Phish&#x27;s guitarist, Trey Anastasio, commented to the crowd after their 8-7-2015 cover, suggesting that Mickey and Aaron should play together again, which was followed by Ween&#x27;s first comeback show at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, CO on 2-12-2016 where the song was played among 32 others.
* Ash recorded a version of &quot;What Deaner Was Talkin&#x27; About&quot;, released as a B-side on their 1997 single &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot;. This track also features on their limited edition live album, &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot;.
* Amos Lee performed &quot;Buenas Tardes Amigo&quot; on an iTunes exclusive live album entitled &quot;iTunes Live from SoHo&quot;.
* Jon Auer (The Posies, Big Star) covered &quot;Baby Bitch&quot; on his solo EP &quot;6 1/2&quot;.
* Folk punk musician Sunny War covered &quot;Baby Bitch&quot; on her 2023 album &quot;Anarchist Gospel&quot;.

==Deluxe edition==
On June 7, 2024, Ween announced they would be releasing a deluxe edition of &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; to commemorate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, with a release date of August 2, 2024. The deluxe edition features both remasters of the original tracks done by Bernie Grundman, as well as 15 previously unreleased tracks. One of these tracks, &quot;Junkie Boy&quot;, was released as a single the same day as the announcement. On July 19, a second single was released for the 30th anniversary edition, a demo version of &quot;Voodoo Lady&quot;.

The deluxe edition came packaged with a booklet written by Dean Ween giving more details about the album&#x27;s production, revealing alternate track lists that were considered, giving stories of the album&#x27;s making, and showing exclusive photos and production notes.

The deluxe edition was a commercial success. &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that it had sold 5,300 copies in its first week, with sales being strong enough for the deluxe edition to hit number 15 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Album Sales chart and number 3 on the magazine&#x27;s Vinyl Albums chart.

<doc id="637005" wikidata="Q26360" url="?curid=637005" title="Croatian kuna">
<text>The kuna (; sign: kn; code: HRK) was the currency of Croatia from 1994 until 2023, when it was replaced by the euro. The kuna was subdivided into 100 lipa. It was issued by the Croatian National Bank and the coins were minted by the Croatian Mint.

In the Croatian language, the word means and means , both references to their historical use in medieval trading.

== History and etymology ==

Records exist from the Middle Ages of a tax and/or a currency in the then highly valued marten skins, which were recorded as &quot;marturina&quot; (&quot;marten tax&quot;) or &quot;kunovina&quot;, in Lower Pannonia, modern day Hungary and Slavonia. Slavonia&#x27;s first minted currency was the frizatik, but in the 13th century the Ban of Slavonia issued a marten-adorned silver coin called the banovac. 

The idea of a kuna currency reappeared in 1939 when the Banovina of Croatia, an autonomous province established within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, planned to issue its own money, along with the Yugoslav dinar. In 1941, when the Ustaše regime formed the Independent State of Croatia, they used the kuna as its currency. It remained in circulation until 1945, when Croatia became part of SFR Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav dinar became the official currency.

The plural form of &quot;&quot; in Croatian is &quot;kune&quot;. It can vary because of different number declension rules (e.g. &quot;2 kune&quot;, &quot;10 kuna&quot;).

It has no relation to the various Slavic currencies named &quot;koruna&quot; (translated as &quot;kruna&quot; in Croatian), which means &quot;crown&quot;.

== Modern currency ==
The modern kuna was introduced on 30 May 1994, starting a period of transition from the Croatian dinar, introduced in 1991, which ended on 31 December 1994. One kuna was equivalent to 1,000 dinars at a fixed exchange rate. The kuna was pegged to the Deutsche Mark from the start. With the replacement of the mark by the euro, the kuna&#x27;s peg effectively switched to the euro.

The choice of the name &quot;kuna&quot; was controversial because the same currency name had been used by the Independent State of Croatia, but this was dismissed as a red herring, since the same name was also in use during the Banovina of Croatia and by the State Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH). An alternative proposal for the name of the new currency was &quot;kruna&quot; (crown), divided into 100 &quot;banica&quot; (viceroy&#x27;s wife), but this was deemed too similar to the Austro-Hungarian krone and found inappropriate for the country which is a republic, even though Czechia and (until 2008) Slovakia have used currencies whose names translate to &quot;crown&quot;.

A long-time policy of the Croatian National Bank was to keep the fluctuations of the kuna&#x27;s exchange rate against the euro (or, previously, the mark) within a relatively stable range. Since the introduction of the euro in 1999, the exchange rate between the two currencies rarely fluctuated to a substantial degree, remaining at a near constant 7.5:1 (HRK to EUR) rate. Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 and the Exchange Rate Mechanism on 10 July 2020 at a rate of 7.53450 HRK to €1.

The kuna was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2023 after satisfying prerequisites as the initial time estimate of standard four years after joining the European Union proved too short.

A two-week transition period during which kuna cash remained as legal tender in circulation alongside the euro ended on 14 January. Cash could be exchanged at any eurozone national central banks until 28 February and at any bank (Fina and Hrvatska pošta in Croatia) until the end of 2023 at no charge. The Croatian National Bank will do the same for notes indefinitely and for coins until the end of 2025.

== Coins ==

In 1994, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 lipa, 1, 2, 5 and 25 kuna. The coins are issued in two versions: one with the name of the plant or animal in Croatian (issued in odd years), the other with the name in Latin (issued in even years). Overall more coins have been minted with Croatian names than with names in Latin.

&quot;Lipa&quot; is the Croatian word for linden or tilia tree, a species that was traditionally planted around marketplaces in Croatia and other lands under Habsburg monarchy rule during the early modern period.

Due to their low value, 1 and 2 lipa coins were rarely used. Since 2009, these coins were no longer minted, but the Croatian National Bank stated that it had no plans for withdrawing them, and the 1 and 2 lipa coins were still minted as non-circulating, mainly for numismatic collections.


=== Commemorative coins ===

Commemorative coins of the Croatian were issued between 1995 and 2022.

== Banknotes ==
The notes were designed by Miroslav Šutej and , and all feature prominent Croatians on front and architectural motifs on back. The geometric figures at lower left on front (except the 5-kuna note) are intaglio printed for recognition by the blind people. To the right of the coat of arms on front is a microprinted version of the Croatian national anthem, Lijepa naša domovino (&quot;Our Beautiful Homeland&quot;). The overall design is reminiscent of Deutsche Mark banknotes of the fourth series.

The first series of notes was dated 31 October 1993. The 5, 10 and 20 kuna notes from this series were withdrawn on 1 April 2007, and the 50, 100 and 200 kuna notes were withdrawn on 1 January 2010, but remain exchangeable at the HNB in Zagreb.

New series of notes with tweaked, but similar designs and improved security features were released in 2001, 2004, 2012 and 2014.

<doc id="637009" wikidata="Q417740" url="?curid=637009" title="Lovastatin">
<text>Lovastatin, sold under the brand name Mevacor among others, is a statin medication, to treat high blood cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Its use is recommended together with lifestyle changes. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation, headache, muscles pains, rash, and trouble sleeping. Serious side effects may include liver problems, muscle breakdown, and kidney failure. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby and use during breastfeeding is not recommended. It works by decreasing the liver&#x27;s ability to produce cholesterol by blocking the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.
Lovastatin was patented in 1979 and approved for medical use in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 111th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
The primary uses of lovastatin is for the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels.

==Side effects==
Lovastatin is usually well tolerated, with the most common side effects being, in approximately descending order of frequency: creatine phosphokinase elevation, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, muscle aches or pains, nausea, indigestion, weakness, blurred vision, rash, dizziness and muscle cramps. As with all statin drugs, it can occasionally cause myopathy, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), dermatomyositis or rhabdomyolysis. This can be life-threatening if not recognised and treated in time, so any unexplained muscle pain or weakness whilst on lovastatin should be promptly mentioned to the prescribing doctor. Other uncommon side effects that should be promptly mentioned to either the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service include:

These less serious side effects should still be reported if they persist or increase in severity:
===Contraindications===
Contraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with lovastatin, include pregnancy, breast feeding, and liver disease. Lovastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X); it may cause birth defects such as skeletal deformities or learning disabilities. Owing to its potential to disrupt infant lipid metabolism, lovastatin should not be taken while breastfeeding. Patients with liver disease should not take lovastatin.

== Interactions ==

As with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and other statin drugs metabolized via CYP3A4, drinking grapefruit juice during lovastatin therapy may increase the risk of side effects. Components of grapefruit juice, the flavonoid naringin, or the furanocoumarin bergamottin inhibit CYP3A4 &quot;in vitro&quot;, and may account for the &quot;in vivo&quot; effect of grapefruit juice concentrate decreasing the metabolic clearance of lovastatin, and increasing its plasma concentrations.

==Mechanism of action==
Lovastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate.
Mevalonate is a required building block for cholesterol biosynthesis and lovastatin interferes with its production by acting as a reversible competitive inhibitor for HMG-CoA, which binds to the HMG-CoA reductase. Lovastatin is a prodrug, an inactive lactone in its native form, the gamma-lactone closed ring form in which it is administered, is hydrolysed in vivo to the β-hydroxy acid open ring form; which is the active form.

Lovastatin and other statins have been studied for their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects. No such effects were seen in the early studies. More recent investigations revealed some chemopreventive and therapeutic effects, for certain types of cancer, especially in combination of statins with other anticancer drugs. It is likely that these effect are mediated by the properties of statins to reduce proteasome activity, leading to an accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27, and to subsequent G1-phase arrest, as seen in cells of different cancer lines.

==History==

Compactin and lovastatin, natural products with a powerful inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase, were discovered in the 1970s, and taken into clinical development as potential drugs for lowering LDL cholesterol.

In 1982, some small-scale clinical investigations of lovastatin, a polyketide-derived natural product isolated from &quot;Aspergillus terreus&quot;, in very high-risk patients were undertaken, in which dramatic reductions in LDL cholesterol were observed, with very few adverse effects. After the additional animal safety studies with lovastatin revealed no toxicity of the type thought to be associated with compactin, clinical studies continued.

Large-scale trials confirmed the effectiveness of lovastatin. Observed tolerability continued to be excellent, and lovastatin was approved by the US FDA in 1987. It was the first statin approved by the FDA.

Lovastatin is also naturally produced by certain higher fungi, such as &quot;Pleurotus ostreatus&quot; (oyster mushroom) and closely related &quot;Pleurotus&quot; spp. Research into the effect of oyster mushroom and its extracts on the cholesterol levels of laboratory animals has been extensive, although the effect has been demonstrated in a very limited number of human subjects.

In 1998, the FDA placed a ban on the sale of dietary supplements derived from red yeast rice, which naturally contains lovastatin, arguing that products containing prescription agents require drug approval. Judge Dale A. Kimball of the United States District Court for the District of Utah, granted a motion by Cholestin&#x27;s manufacturer, Pharmanex, that the agency&#x27;s ban was illegal under the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act because the product was marketed as a dietary supplement, not a drug.
The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the isoprenes that are building-blocks of squalene, the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is at the level of the microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.

HMG CoA reductase occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway and is among the first committed steps to cholesterol formulation. Inhibition of this enzyme could lead to accumulation of HMG CoA, a water-soluble intermediate that is, then, capable of being readily metabolized to simpler molecules. This inhibition of reductase would lead to accumulation of lipophylic intermediates with a formal sterol ring.

Lovastatin was the first specific inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase to receive approval for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The first breakthrough in efforts to find a potent, specific, competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase occurred in 1976, when Endo &quot;et al.&quot; reported the discovery of mevastatin, a highly functionalized fungal metabolite, isolated from cultures of &quot;Penicillium citrium&quot;.

===Biosynthesis===
The biosynthesis of lovastatin occurs via an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway. The six genes that encode enzymes that are essential for the biosynthesis of lovastatin are lovB, lovC, lovA, lovD, lovG, and lovF . The synthesis of dihydromonacolin L requires a total of 9-malonyl Coa . It proceeds in the PKS pathway until it reaches (E) a hexaketide, where it undergoes a Diels-Alder cycloaddition to form the fused rings. After cyclization it continues through the PKS pathway until it reaches (I) a nonaketide, which then undergoes release from LovB through the thioesterase encoded by LovG. Dihydromonacolin L, (J), then undergoes oxidation and dehydration via a cytochrome P450 oxygenase encoded by LovA to obtain monacolin J, (L).

The MT domain from lovB is active in the conversion of (B) to (C) when it transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to the tetraketide (C) . Because LovB contains an inactive ER domain, LovC is required at specific steps to obtain fully reduced products. The domain organization of LovB, LovC, LovG and LovF is shown in Figure 2. The inactive ER domain of lovB is shown with an oval and where LovC acts in trans to LovB is shown with a red box.

In a parallel pathway, the diketide side chain of lovastatin is synthesized by another highly reducing type I polyketide synthase enzyme encoded by LovF . Lastly, the side chain, 2-methylbutyrate (M) is covalently attached to C-8 hydroxy group of monacolin J (L) by a transesterase encoded by LovD to form lovastatin.

===Total synthesis===
A major bulk of work in the synthesis of lovastatin was done by M. Hirama in the 1980s.

Hirama synthesized compactin and used one of the intermediates to follow a different path to get to lovastatin. The synthetic sequence is shown in the schemes below. The γ-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in methanol and then silylation to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the silyl ether. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with Ac2O and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined using 1.3 eq sodium hydride in THF followed by reflux in chlorobenzene for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3.

Simple organic reactions were used to get to lovastatin as shown in the scheme.

==Society and culture==

<text>Thinktank, Birmingham (formerly known as simply Thinktank) is a science museum in Birmingham, England. Opened in 2001, it is part of Birmingham Museums Trust and is located within the Millennium Point complex on Curzon Street, Digbeth.

==History==

The Birmingham Collection of Science &amp; Industry was started in the mid-19th century, initially consisting of collections of weapons from the gun trade and the Birmingham Proof House. The Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery opened in 1885, including science collections. In 1951, the Museum of Science and Industry opened at Elkington Silver Electroplating Works, Newhall Street. Over the following years, the museum acquired individual artefacts, as well as entire collections, that were related to local industry and the history of science and technology.

Birmingham City Council decided in 1995 to relocate the museum when it was given an opportunity by the Millennium Commission to construct a new building. The former museum closed in 1997, and Thinktank opened on 29 September 2001 as part of the £114-million Millennium Point complex. It was funded by Birmingham City Council, supported by the Millennium Commission. The area adjacent to the building is designated Eastside City Park. While many objects were put on display at Thinktank, others were stored at the Birmingham Museum Collection Centre, and some were brought out of storage.

Although the previous science museum was free to enter, Thinktank charges an entrance fee. In 2005 the museum underwent a £2 million upgrade, including the installation of a planetarium. By 2007 it had received over 1 million visitors. In April 2012, Birmingham Museums Trust took over governance and management responsibility for Thinktank, along with eight other sites.

In March 2015, a new &quot;Spitfire gallery&quot; opened, relating the displayed aircraft to their production, locally. Among the new exhibits are a leather flying helmet previously belonging to Helen Kerly, one of only two British civilian women commended for flying during the Second World War.

=== Locomotives ===
=== Trams ===
=== Cars ===
===Stationary steam engines===
Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum has a big collection of stationary steam engines. The following are some examples of them:

=== Other machines ===
== Displays ==
Thinktank has four floors of over 200 hands-on exhibits and artefacts. Each floor has a theme, in general going from the past, in &quot;The Past&quot; (Level 0), through &quot;The Balcony&quot; (Level 1) and &quot;The Present&quot; (Level 2), to the future, in &quot;The Future&quot; gallery (Level 3). It has lost its theme as new items have been added. 

== Surroundings ==
The museum shares the Millennium Point building with Birmingham City University, and is situated in the Eastside district. It lies near Aston University and the Gun Quarter – which was for many years the centre of world&#x27;s gun-manufacturing industry. Immediately opposite are The Woodman, a public house, and Curzon Street railway station - both listed buildings.

<text>Matthiola () is a genus of flowering plant in the mustard family Brassicaceae. It is named after Italian naturalist Pietro Andrea Mattioli (1501–1577). The genus contains about 50 species of annual, biennial and perennial herbaceous plants and subshrubs. Many are cultivated for their heavily scented, colorful flowers.

The common name stock may be applied to the whole genus, more specifically to varieties and cultivars of &quot;Matthiola incana&quot;. The common names evening stock and night-scented stock are applied to varieties of &quot;Matthiola longipetala&quot; (syn. &quot;M. bicornis&quot;). The common name Virginia stock refers to a separate genus of the same family (&quot;Malcolmia maritima&quot;).

<text>Herbert Karl Johannes Seifert (; 27 May 1907, Bernstadt – 1 October 1996, Heidelberg) was a German mathematician known for his work in topology.

==Biography==
Seifert was born in Bernstadt auf dem Eigen, but soon moved to Bautzen, where he attended primary school at the Knabenbürgerschule, and secondary school at the Oberrealschule. 

In 1926 Seifert entered the Dresden University of Technology. The next year he attended a course on topology given by William Threlfall. This would be the beginning both of his lifelong work in the subject and his friendship with Threlfall. In the year 1928–29 he visited the University of Göttingen, where topologists such as Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov and Heinz Hopf were working. 

In 1930 he received his doctorate with his work on three-dimensional closed manifolds (which contains the Seifert–van Kampen theorem). He then moved to the University of Leipzig, where he received his second doctorate in 1932. It was here that Seifert submitted his dissertation, &quot;Topologie 3-dimensionaler gefaserter Räume&quot; (“Topology of 3-dimensional fibred spaces”), on 1 February 1932, and he was awarded with this doctorate of philosophy after his oral examination on March 3. The manifolds he studied in his thesis were afterwards named Seifert fiber spaces.

Seifert continued to collaborate with Threlfall, and in 1934 (the year Seifert received his habilitation) they published their &quot;Lehrbuch der Topologie&quot;. In 1938 they published &quot;Variationsrechnung im Grossen&quot;.

In 1935, Seifert was summoned to a post at the University of Heidelberg, where he took a position vacated by the dismissal of a Jewish professor. During World War II he volunteered for a position at a Luftwaffe research center, the Institut für Gasdynamik. After the war, Seifert was one of the few German professors whom the Allies trusted during the period of denazification.

In the year 1948–49 Seifert visited the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. On 13 September 1949, soon after returning to Germany, he married Katharina Korn. 

Seifert retired in 1975. His students include Albrecht Dold, Dieter Puppe, and Horst Schubert.

<text>Porth () is a town and community in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan, Wales. Lying in the Rhondda Valley, it is regarded as the gateway connecting the Rhondda Fawr and Rhondda Fach valleys due to both valleys meeting at Porth. The Welsh word &quot;porth&quot; means &quot;gate&quot;. Porth is a predominantly English-speaking community.

Neighbouring villages include Trealaw, Trebanog, Trehafod and Ynyshir.

==History==
===Early history===
During prehistoric times the area now known as Porth was an uninhabited wooded area. Although there is evidence of settlements in the upper reaches of the valley, only cairns used as way-markers have been discovered on the higher points in the Porth area. During the medieval period the area came under the commote of Glynrhondda within the cantref of Penychen, though the area remained uninhabited. Although there were no permanent buildings of note at this time, it is known that the area would have experienced travelers with two bridges built over the River Rhondda at Porth, the Pont Rheola and Pont y Cymmer. Both bridges date to at least the 1530s when they were mentioned by antiquary John Leland. These bridges were wooden in construct and were later rebuilt in stone. The first buildings of note in the region were built to the south of Porth in the community known today as Cymmer, mainly a chapel, Capel y Cymmer (1743) and a mill on the south bank of the River Rhondda. By the 18th century there were a handful of farm houses, mainly in the northern slopes of Llwyncelyn. During this pre-industrial era, the locale was known as Cymmer, an old Welsh word that describes the point where two rivers converge. It was only during the industrial period that the mining operations of the Porth Estate and the subsequently named railway station that saw the name Porth adopted.

===Industrial growth===
In 1809, Walter Coffin sunk the first coal pit in the Rhondda, further up the valley in Dinas, but a lack of a transportation network greatly affected the profitability of coal mining as an industry in the region. Coffin tackled this problem by constructing a one-mile tramline which connected his mines in Dinas to a tramline built by Dr. Richard Griffiths at Denia (modern spelling Dynea) (Pontypridd), which linked to a private canal that joined onto the Glamorganshire Canal at Treforest. Coffin&#x27;s tramline followed the southern bank of the River Rhondda and ran through Porth. The existence of the tramline made the development of the Porth and Cymmer region far more attractive, and by the middle of the 19th century there was an impetus to expand coal mining in the area. In 1841 Richard Lewis joined Coffin in trying to exploit the region with his level built at Cymmer. This resulted in the construction of around fifty miners&#x27; cottages, several of which were located in Porth. In 1844 Lewis Edwards of Newport and George Gethin of Penygraig opened a small level at Nyth-bran on the eastern borders of Porth, the villages&#x27; first coal mine. This was followed in 1845 by the sinking of the Porth Colliery by David James of Merthyr, the success of which saw him build the Llwyncelyn Colliery in 1851, also in Porth. By 1850 the Taff Vale Railway had been extended to Cymmer replacing the tramline, allowing direct access between the lower Rhondda and the ports of Cardiff.

In 1850 the Troedyrhiw Colliery (later to become the Aber-Rhondda Colliery), which was sunk on the northern borders of Porth and the neighbouring village of Ynyshir by Leonard Hadley of Caerleon five years earlier, came into the ownership of a new consortium known as the Troedyrhiw Coal Company. This company was formed by James Thomas, a former miner, Matthew Cop, a Cardiff docksman and John Lewis, a grocer from Aberdare. In 1852 the same company opened the Tynewydd Colliery at the junction of the Rhondda Fawr and Fach rivers, Porth&#x27;s fourth mine. The mine quickly struck the Rhondda No. 3 seam, and coking ovens were built at the surface, providing further employment.

With the increase in population, transport links began to improve in the Rhondda. This was hampered by subsidence caused the mining underground, which resulted in the roads of Porth Square sinking by eight foot. In 1860 a two horsed omnibus service was introduced between Porth and Pontypridd, but was replaced by a system of horsedrawn tramcars in 1888. Although the tramline and subsequently the railway had passed through Porth for two decades, servicing the collieries, it was not until 1861 that the village had its first railway station; and a passenger service did not commence until January 1863.

As the population continued to increase, businesses and infrastructure grew around the coal industry. The Rhondda Urban Council chose Porth as one of two sites to build gas works and the area around Porth Square and Hannah Street became the commercial centre of the village. One of the more notable businesses to open in Porth was the Thomas &amp; Evans grocers one of the first of a chain of shops owned by William Thomas and William Evans two entrepreneurs from Pembrokeshire. Evans became an important figure in the growth of Porth, and in the late 1890s he opened a jam factory and the Welsh Hills Mineral Water factory, later to become Corona carbonated drinks which would remain a major manufacturer within the village up until the 1980s.

Coal mining in the Rhondda continued to expand throughout the early 20th century, although no further mines were sunk in Porth. The population continued to grow but conditions became hard after the Great Depression, and by the mid 1920s unemployment among mine workers rocketed. Matters worsened after the disastrous general strike of 1926 which saw many miners out of work for months. As mechanisation allowed other mining areas to become more profitable, the antiquated Rhondda mines sunk nearly 75 years earlier were unable to modernise and one-by-one began to close. Porth, like the rest of the Rhondda, was built solely around the coal industry, and with its collapse came mass unemployment, resulting in economic migration. There was a brief respite during the Second World War, when employment rose sharply. This was partially due for a need for Rhondda steam coal, but also due to large munition factories built in Bridgend, Hirwaun and Treforest to which the workers commuted. With the end of the war it was apparent that unemployment would return, but to ensure that the newly found factory skills gained during the previous six years were not lost the British Government passed the Distribution of Industry Act in 1945. This saw 25 new industry come to the Rhondda, six of them based in Porth. They ranged from Messrs. Jacob Beatus&#x27; box making company, a metal toy factory and a branch of Remploy aimed at disabled workers.

===Tynewydd Colliery disaster===

On 11 April 1877 the Tynewydd Colliery - was the scene of a mine disaster that led to a notable mine rescue operation following which four first-class and twenty-one second-class Albert Medals for Lifesaving were awarded. A build-up of water in old workings of the neighbouring Cymmer Colliery resulted in flooding of the Tynewydd mine. Only fourteen of approximately 100 miners employed at the mine were working underground at the time of the accident.

Four of the trapped miners were rescued after eighteen hours but a fifth, William Morgan, was crushed to death by an escape of compressed air. Four other miners were drowned. The remaining five, Dafydd Jenkins, Moses Powell, George Jenkins, John Thomas and the boy David Hughes, were located behind a thirty-eight yards thick barrier of coal with a large quantity of water and compressed air and probably gas behind it. It took four days to cut through the barrier until on 19 April only a few yards remained. At this stage operations were halted because there was a danger of pent-up water behind the barrier bursting through. In spite of this danger four, or alternatively five, of the rescuers volunteered to continue, according to some reports Daniel Thomas, Isaac Pride, John William Howell and William Beith. There is some confusion over the number and names of the rescuers - Daniel Thomas, listed as one of those awarded the first-class medal, is referred to as owner of Brithweunydd Level, the Tynewydd colliery owner is reported to have been considered for but not awarded a first-class medal because of his impending trial on manslaughter charges of which he was acquitted, and Gwilym Thomas is seen in a photograph of &quot;three of the rescuers&quot; with Isaac Pride and Abraham &quot;Abby&quot; Dodd. An escape of inflammable gas under pressure extinguished the rescue team&#x27;s Davy lamps but they continued working in darkness. At 3.00 p.m. on 20 April the breakthrough occurred.

Because of the problems posed by the potential escape of air under pressure, the mine engineers erected stout air doors to contain any escaping air and gas and confine possible explosions. One was built within a yard of the face. Isaac Pride who volunteered to break through the barrier had to work within a very confined space. A blast of air was released as his pick broke through and threw him back against the air door, but he quickly set about enlarging the hole, assisted by &quot;Abby&quot; Dodd. They found the five trapped miners too weak to stand. Between them Pride and Dodd pulled the five to safety as the water level rose. It is claimed that &quot;Abby&quot; Dodd was not awarded an Albert Medal because of an interview he gave to a journalist criticising the colliery owners, at a time when there had been considerable conflict in the Welsh coal mines between miners and owners.

The Albert Medals awarded at Tynewydd were the first awarded for gallantry on land. The medal had been introduced a decade earlier to honour heroic lifesaving efforts in rescues at sea. The Albert Medal First Class awarded to William Beith can be seen as part of the permanent exhibition in the Coins and Medals Gallery at the National Museum of Wales in Cathays Park, Cardiff. William Beith was a mechanical engineer at Harris&#x27;s Navigation Colliery, Quaker&#x27;s Yard, Merthyr Tydfil. In addition, the colliery doctor, Dr. Henry Naunton Davies, was awarded the first British Medical Association Gold Medal for his work during the disaster.

==Present day==
Today the main internal economy of Porth is retail and the centre of Porth is home to the shopping district based around Hannah Street. Most other businesses are located on nearby Pontypridd Road and Porth Street. Porth is home to around 6,000 people living in different areas of the town, namely Birchgrove, Britannia, Glynfach, Llwyncelyn, Mount Pleasant and Porth town centre.

Porth crater on Mars is named after the town.

== Education ==
Secondary school age children are most likely to attend Porth County Community School an English medium school, or Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhondda which is primarily a Welsh speaking school, situated in the Cymmer area of Porth.

== Transport ==
Porth railway station has services to Treherbert and Cardiff on the Rhondda Line. Transport for Wales is responsible for the railway service available in Porth.

The construction of the Porth-Tylorstown bypass (Porth Relief Road) has caused traffic jams and detours. The bypass was opened on 28 December 2006 but landscaping work finished in April 2007. The construction of the bypass was first discussed over 50 years ago.

== Sport and leisure ==
The town is also the home of The Pop Factory, opened in 2000 with an opening ceremony attended by Tom Jones, Cerys Matthews and Kelly Jones. It is both a television studio and recording studio. The owners of the building also contribute to the local area, and organised the Tom Jones homecoming concert at Ynysangharad Park, Pontypridd, in May 2005.

Porth is home to Welsh Rugby Union affiliated rugby club Porth Harlequins.

Football Association of Wales affiliated A.F.C. Porth play their home matches at Dinas Park and their base is the Wyndham Constitutional Club.

Porth is home to South Wales Automobile Club, (S.W.A.C.), SWAC are the organisers of the Welsh Rally. &#x27;The Welsh Rally&#x27;, as the event is often referred to, first ran in 1937 and has seen many top international rally drivers taking part over the years.

<doc id="637027" wikidata="Q1744694" url="?curid=637027" title="Bromsgrove District">
<text>Bromsgrove is a local government district in north-east Worcestershire, England. It is named after its only town, Bromsgrove, where its council is based, but also includes several villages and surrounding rural areas. It borders the built-up area of Birmingham to the north. Other places in the district include Alvechurch, Aston Fields, Belbroughton, Catshill, Clent, Hagley, Rubery, Stoke Prior and Wythall. The population at the 2021 census was 99,475.

The neighbouring districts are Redditch, Wychavon, Wyre Forest, South Staffordshire, Dudley, Birmingham, Solihull and Stratford-on-Avon.

==History==
The town of Bromsgrove had been governed by improvement commissioners from 1846, who were replaced by an elected local board in 1859, which in turn was converted into an urban district council in 1894.

The modern district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Bromsgrove Urban District
*Bromsgrove Rural District
The new district was named Bromsgrove after its largest settlement.

==Governance==
Bromsgrove District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Worcestershire County Council. Much of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

Bromsgrove forms part of the Greater Birmingham &amp; Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership. Since 2008 the council has developed shared working arrangements with neighbouring Redditch Borough Council, with the two organisations sharing a chief executive, management team and other staff.


===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by an administration comprising the Conservatives and most of the independents, led by Conservative councillor Karen May.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing councils before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1995 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent change of allegiance in June 2024, the composition of the council was:
Seven of the independent councillors sit together as the &quot;2023 Independents&quot; group, which forms the council&#x27;s administration with the Conservatives. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 31 councillors representing 30 wards, with each ward electing one councillor except Belbroughton and Romsley ward which elects two. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at Parkside, at the corner of Market Street and Stourbridge Road. The building was formerly the Parkside School, built in 1912. The school moved to a new building in 2008. The old building was subsequently converted and extended to become the council&#x27;s headquarters, as well as an area office for Worcestershire County Council and new library for the town, opening in 2015.

When first created in 1974 the council had inherited offices at St John&#x27;s Court (then known as the Council House) from Bromsgrove Urban District Council and at 94 Birmingham Road from Bromsgrove Rural District Council. The council subsequently moved to a modern office building on Burcot Lane, also called the Council House, which was formally opened in 1986. It remained there until the move to Parkside in 2015. The Burcot Lane building has since been demolished.

==Transport==
Bromsgrove railway station is the local station for the district&#x27;s centre, but there are several others within the district. Road travel, especially to Birmingham, is also important in the district.

Barnt Green railway station and Alvechurch railway station are on the line to Redditch.

Hagley railway station and Wythall railway station are also on lines leading into Birmingham, which pass through the edges of the district.

Bromsgrove is situated on Route 5 and 46 of the National Cycle Network. This gives cyclists easy access to Droitwich, Redditch, Birmingham and beyond.

==Parishes==

Most of the district&#x27;s area is covered by civil parishes, the exceptions being two separate parts of the pre-1974 Bromsgrove Urban District which have not since been added to parishes: one covering the main part of the Bromsgrove built-up area, and another around Rubery on the northern edge of the district adjoining Birmingham. At the 2021 census, nearly half the district&#x27;s population lived in the unparished areas. The most populous parishes are Wythall (which also contains the large village of Hollywood) and Hagley. Each parish has a parish council.

<text>Marco Fu Ka-chun, MH, JP (; born 8 January 1978) is a Hong Kong professional snooker player. He is a three-time ranking event winner, having won the 2007 Grand Prix, the 2013 Australian Goldfields Open and the 2016 Scottish Open. He has been a runner-up at two Triple Crown events, at the 2008 UK Championship and the 2011 Masters. In addition, Fu has reached the semi-finals of the World Championship twice—in 2006 and in 2016.

Fu reached a career-high ranking of fifth in the world in 2017. He turned professional in 1998 and has remained on the World Snooker Tour to-date. Despite not competing in events during the COVID-19 pandemic, Fu was given an invitational place to remain on the tour during the 2021–22 snooker season. As a prolific break-builder, Fu has compiled over 500 century breaks in professional competition, including five maximum breaks. A cultural icon in Hong Kong, Fu presented a 10-episode chat show called &quot;Marco Fu and Friends&quot; on ViuTV.

==Career==
===Early career===
Marco Fu was born on 8 January 1978 in British Hong Kong. He began playing snooker at age nine, but did not do so regularly until he was 15. Fu migrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with his parents at age 12. After his high school graduation at age 18, Hong Kong Billiard Sports Control Council Co. Ltd. President Joseph Lo invited him to return to Hong Kong to begin his career as a professional snooker player. Before turning professional, Fu won the IBSF World Snooker Championship and the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship, both in 1997.

After winning these tournaments, Fu turned professional for the 1998–99 snooker season. In his first season as a professional, he was ranked 377th in the world. He reached the final of the Grand Prix, beating Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 5–2 and then Peter Ebdon 5–3. Stephen Lee defeated him 2–9 in the final. During the rest of the 1998–99 season, Fu qualified for four more ranking tournaments, including the 1999 World Snooker Championship, winning four qualifying matches before losing to James Wattana 8–10 in the first round of the main draw. He was voted World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) Newcomer of the Year and WSA Young Player of the Year in 1999.

===World Championship quarter-finalist (1999–2003)===
In the 1999–00 season, with Fu now ranked 35th in the world, he received automatic entry into the main draw of most of the ranking tournaments. Although he failed to repeat the success of reaching the final of the Grand Prix, he made a run to the quarter-finals before losing to Ali Carter. Other achievements of note include reaching the semi-finals of the 2000 Malta Grand Prix and the Scottish Open. Following a dramatic rise, in the 2000–01 season Fu was ranked 15th in the world, his first appearance in the top 16. However, a succession of defeats and a first-round loss at the 2001 World Snooker Championship to Chris Small, saw him fall out of the top 16 for the next season. In the 2001–02 season Fu&#x27;s best result was a last 16 appearance at the LG Cup. He failed to qualify for three ranking events, including the 2002 World Snooker Championship, and, as a result, his ranking fell to 27 for the following season.

Prior to the 2003 Welsh Open, his best result of the 2002–03 season was reaching the third round of the 2002 UK Championship in December 2002. However, at the Welsh Open in February, Fu defeated Stephen Lee 5–0 in the second round and beat Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 5–3 in the quarter-finals before losing his semi-final 4–6 to Stephen Hendry, who went on to win the title. Going into the 2003 World Snooker Championship three months later, after first round losses at the European and Scottish Opens, he drew world number one Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the first round.

&quot;Snooker Scene&quot; later described the match between O&#x27;Sullivan and Fu as &quot;one of the greatest upsets in the history of the game&quot;. Fu held a 6–3 overnight lead and, despite O&#x27;Sullivan making a maximum break, Fu won 10–6. Fu subsequently eliminated Alan McManus 13–7 in the second round, before losing 7–13 to Stephen Lee in his quarter-final match. Later that year, Fu won his first professional title at the invitational Premier League, beating Mark Williams 9–5 in the final.

===First ranking tournament title (2004–2008)===
As a result of his run to the quarter-finals of the World Championship the previous season, Fu climbed to number 19 in the world rankings for the 2003–04 season. He qualified for all the ranking tournaments except the World Championship. His best result included a third round loss to Michael Holt in the LG Cup and reaching the semi-finals of the Welsh Open, beating Liu Song, Matthew Stevens, Ken Doherty and Stephen Hendry before succumbing to Steve Davis. Fu finished the season ranked 16th in the world.

His best result the following season was a quarter-final loss to Ding Junhui at the China Open. He finished the season ranked 25, falling nine places. A series of first round defeats during the 2005–06 season saw him provisionally drop out of the top 32. However, he had a good run at the 2006 World Championship, beating three seeded players—Alan McManus 10–3, Stephen Maguire 13–4, and Ken Doherty 13–10. He reached the semi-finals where he lost to the 2002 world champion Peter Ebdon 16–17. In that match, Fu was 9–15 down with only one session left to play, but won seven out of the next eight frames to send the match into the deciding frame, which Ebdon eventually won. This run enabled him to stay in the world top 32 for next season, ranked 22.
In the 2006–07 season he did not compete in the 2006 UK Championship so he could attend the 2006 Asian Games, where he won two silver medals. At the 2007 World Snooker Championship, Fu lost 3–10 to Anthony Hamilton in the first round. His best result during the season was a quarter-final run in the China Open, where he lost to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. Following a first round loss at the Shanghai Masters, and nine years after his first appearance in a ranking final at the 1998 Grand Prix, Fu won the 2007 Grand Prix —his first victory in a ranking event. After defeating the reigning world champion John Higgins in the first knock-out round 5–4, Liu Song 5–0 in the quarter-finals. and Gerard Greene 6–5 in the semi-finals, he faced Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the final.

He qualified for the 2008 World Snooker Championship, with a 10–3 win over Alan McManus. He played Ding in the first round where he lost 9–10. He capped a successful season by finishing in career high 14th in the rankings, a climb of thirteen places from the previous season.

===UK Championship finalist (2008–2010)===
The 2008–09 season started with a last 32 loss to Barry Hawkins in the Northern Ireland Trophy and losing in the quarter-finals of the Shanghai Masters to Mark Selby. At the Grand Prix, he lost in the second round to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, a rematch of last season&#x27;s final. At the 2008 UK Championship, he beat Barry Hawkins in the first round, followed by Matthew Stevens and Joe Perry. In the semi-finals, Fu defeated Ali Carter: after trailing 2–5, he levelled to 6–6 and won 8–6. In the final, Shaun Murphy defeated Fu 9–10. He suffered a first round defeat to John Higgins at the Masters. At the 2009 World Snooker Championship, he advanced to the second round by beating Joe Swail 10–4 before losing 3–13 to Murphy.

In December 2009, Fu participated in the East Asian Games, held in Hong Kong. In the singles competition Yu Delu beat him by 4–1 in the quarter-finals, but he later won a gold medal in the team competition. Fu lost his next three first-round matches. He lost against Peter Lines 3–9 at the 2009 UK Championship, Peter Ebdon 2–6 at the Masters and Andrew Higginson 2–5 at the Welsh Open.

However, Fu won the 2010 Championship League by beating Mark Allen 3–2 in the final. Fu also reached the quarter-finals of the 2010 China Open, where he lost 1–5 against Mark Williams. At the last ranking event of the season, the World Championship, Fu faced Martin Gould in the first round and led 5–4 after the first session. Ultimately Fu lost the match 9–10.

===Masters finalist (2010–15)===

In November 2010, Fu participated in the Asian Games, held in Guangzhou. He won the singles competition by defeating Ding Junhui 4–2 in the final. Fu also reached the semi-finals of the Premier League where he lost 2–5 against Shaun Murphy. He lost in the second round of the 2010 UK Championship 2–9 against Stuart Bingham. Fu participated at the Players Tour Championship, where his best results came at the first and second events in Sheffield, where he reached the semi-finals, losing 1–4 against Stephen Maguire and 2–4 against Mark Selby, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010/2011 stat&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He later finished 16th on the Players Tour Championship Order of Merit.

Fu lost his first round matches at the China Open and World Championship, 3–5 against Judd Trump and 8–10 against Martin Gould, respectively. He finished the season ranked world number 23, the first time he had been outside of the elite top 16 since 2007.

Fu qualified for four of the eight ranking tournaments of the 2011–12 season. At the Welsh Open he lost in the first round 1–4 to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan and lost in the first round of the World Open following a 3–5 defeat to John Higgins. Fu had earlier made the second maximum break of his career during the final qualifying round for the World Open in a match against Matthew Selt. Fu&#x27;s best performance of the season came at the 2011 UK Championship. He qualified by beating Anthony Hamilton 6–5 and then saw off Stuart Bingham 6–4 in the first round to set up a last 16 clash with world number one, Mark Selby who he defeated 6–3 and then played Mark Allen in the quarter-finals. Fu led 5–4 in the match, but lost the last two frames to lose 5–6. Fu qualified for the 2012 World Snooker Championship with a 10–4 win over Shailesh Jogia, but lost in the first round of the event 3–10 to Matthew Stevens. As a result, he finished the season ranked world number 28, his lowest position since 2000.

In Australia, Fu saw a return to form as he beat Joe Perry, Jamie Burnett and Stephen Lee all by 5–1 scorelines to reach the semi-finals of the Australian Goldfields Open. There he lost 2–6 to Peter Ebdon and said after the match that his goal for the season was to reclaim a top 16 place. At the International Championship he secured wins over Martin Gould and Mark Davis to reach the quarter-finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fu let a 3–1 lead against Shaun Murphy slip to lose 4–6. Before he played Mark Allen in the first round of the 2012 UK Championship, Allen reiterated his views that Fu had cheated in a prior match. Fu himself denied the claims and went on to defeat Allen 6–3. Allen received a three-month suspended ban for his comments. In the second round Fu lost 4–6 to Matthew Stevens. He reached his first ranking event final since 2008 at the German Masters by beating Ricky Walden, Peter Lines and Matthew Stevens all 5–3.

He fell 2–6 behind after the first session, but fought back to trail only 7–8 before losing five consecutive frames to end his season with a 7–13 defeat. Fu finished just short of his early season goal to get back into the top 16 as he finished world number 17, but this did mean he had climbed 11 spots during the year.

The Wuxi Classic was Fu&#x27;s first ranking event of the 2013–14 season; he lost 4–5 to Mark King in the second round.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He then played in the Australian Goldfields Open where he defeated Ken Doherty 5–2, Shaun Murphy 5–2 and Dominic Dale 5–1.

The 2017–18 season saw Marco Fu getting off to another difficult start, as he could not reach the quarter final of any ranking event before the turn of the year. Two weeks after suffering a 0–6 defeat against Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the first round of the Masters, Fu revealed that he had undergone laser eye surgery in December to treat retinal degeneration and floaters in his dominant left eye. Fu indicated he regretted taking part in the Masters while still recovering from the surgery. He also announced that he would not enter any more tournaments before making a full recovery and regaining his old level in training. He made his return at the 2018 World Snooker Championship where he lost to Lyu Haotian 5–10.

Following the eye surgery, Fu only reached the quarter-finals of the 2018 World Open, where he lost to David Gilbert, and the 2020 European Masters, losing to Gary Wilson.

===COVID-19 pandemic and career revival (2020-present)===

In February 2020, Fu returned to Hong Kong because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with his last appearance being at the 2020 Welsh Open where he lost to Ding in the opening round. As a consequence of not entering any events during the rest of the season, his ranking steadily dropped out of the Top 64, but an offer of an invitational tour card meant he would not need to qualify to rejoin the tour as a result.

Fu returned to compete in professional snooker tournaments at the 2022 World Snooker Championship, marking the first event since the 2020 Welsh Open in which he played in an event on the main tour. He lost in the first round of qualifying, being defeated in a deciding frame by Ian Burns. As travel restrictions eased in Hong Kong, Fu proceeded to compete in the subsequent 2022-23 season where he did not top his group in the opening event, the 2022 Championship League. He had managed to qualify for the 2022 European Masters and reached the third round, consequently as a result of a bye due to his opponent in the second round not getting a visa, where he lost 5-3 to Farakh Ajaib. He did not qualify for the subsequent 2022 British Open or the 2022 Northern Ireland Open, but was invited to compete as a local wildcard in the 2022 Hong Kong Masters, where he reached the final. In his semi-final match against John Higgins, he compiled his fifth maximum break in the deciding frame.

==Status and records==
Fu is a prolific break-builder, having made his 500th century break at the 2019 Scottish Open. He achieved a maximum break on five occasions, at the 2000 Scottish Masters, the qualifying stages for the 2012 World Open, the 2015 Masters, the 2015 Gibraltar Open and the 2022 Hong Kong Masters . Fu has also made a break of 148 after receiving a in an exhibition match in 2020.

He once held the record for the longest frame in the history of televised snooker. The record of 77 minutes, held with Mark Selby, was played out in the decisive final frame during the quarter-final match at the 2007 UK Championship held in Telford, England. Fu eventually lost the match 7–9. However, the record was then broken by Shaun Murphy and Dave Harold in a match at the China Open later in the same season, with a frame of 93 minutes. As of 2022, the record, held by Fergal O&#x27;Brien and David Gilbert, stands at 123 minutes and 41 seconds.

<doc id="637035" wikidata="Q2160315" url="?curid=637035" title="Rochford District">
<text>Rochford is a local government district in Essex, England. It is named after one of its main settlements, Rochford, where the council is based. The largest town in the district is Rayleigh. Other places in the district include Hockley, Ashingdon, Great Wakering, Canewdon and Hullbridge.

The district borders Maldon District to the north, the City of Chelmsford to the north-west, the Borough of Basildon to the west, the Borough of Castle Point to the south-west, and the City of Southend-on-Sea to the south. To the east, it has a stretch of coast at Foulness Island.

Most of the built-up areas are in the western part of the district, along the railway line from to . Southend Airport straddles the district&#x27;s border with the City of Southend-on-Sea. The eastern part of the district is more sparsely populated.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts, which were abolished at the same time:
*Rayleigh Urban District
*Rochford Rural District

==Governance==
Rochford District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Essex County Council. The district is also entirely covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2023. Following the 2024 election a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, Green Party and independents formed to run the council, led by Liberal Democrat councillor James Newport.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2004 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:

The Green councillor sits with the independents as the &quot;non-aligned group&quot;, which forms the council&#x27;s administration with the Liberal Democrats. The next election is due in May 2026.

===Premises===

The council has its main offices on South Street in Rochford. When the council was created it inherited the former Rochford Rural District Council&#x27;s offices at Roche House, 7 South Street, Rochford and the former Rayleigh Urban District Council&#x27;s offices at Barringtons, 2 Hockley Road, Rayleigh. Both buildings were converted houses. The council acquired other properties along South Street in Rochford and combined them with Roche House to form the council&#x27;s headquarters.

The civic suite wing of Barringtons in Rayleigh, including the council chamber, was retained by the council and serves as the council&#x27;s main meeting place. It closed in 2020 but reopened in 2024 after a period of uncertainty about its future.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2016 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 13 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four for a third of the council at a time. Elections to Essex County Council are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no district council elections.

==Parishes==

The district is divided into 14 civil parishes. The parish council for Rayleigh takes the style &quot;town council&quot;.

*Ashingdon
*Barling Magna
*Canewdon
*Foulness
*Great Wakering
*Hawkwell
*Hockley
*Hullbridge
*Paglesham
*Rawreth
*Rayleigh (town)
*Rochford
*Stambridge
*Sutton

<text>Christopher Small (born 26 September 1973) is a retired Scottish professional snooker player and now a qualified snooker coach. His playing career was ended by the spinal condition ankylosing spondylitis.

==Career==
At age 15, Small was the number 1 under-19 player in Scotland. He turned professional the following year. In 1992, he won the Benson &amp; Hedges Championship, defeating Alan McManus in the final, and in 1995 he reached the Semi-finals of the Welsh Open, and was again a semi-finalist at the 1998 Grand Prix event.
His greatest achievement was winning the 2002 LG Cup, beating Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan and John Higgins, before a 9–5 win over Alan McManus in the final. This followed a season in which he won only three matches, owing to the severity of his medical condition. He reached the quarter-finals of the LG Cup in the following season.

The 2003/2004 season ended with him having to pull out of a World Championship match against Alan McManus while trailing 1–7, as the regular steroid injections he required in his neck caused problems with his vision. The 2004–05 season was disastrous for him, as he lost all his ranking tournament matches, and in September 2005 he announced his retirement from the game. Small then started coaching other players, but by 2009 his condition had worsened, and he had to give up coaching.

Despite being the youngest player ever to win on his Crucible debut (10–7 against Doug Mountjoy aged 18 in 1992), he never progressed beyond the last-16 in the World Championship. He was a regular in the top 32 for several years, but his LG Cup win helped him reach #12 for the 2004–05 season, the only time he had entered the top 16. His career-high break was a 141.

He applied for a grant from a trust fund for players who have fallen on hard times from the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, but was rejected. This decision, stemming from Small&#x27;s refusal to provide a £250 medical certificate, has been criticised by figures including Jimmy White, Graeme Dott (&quot;Everybody in the game that I&#x27;ve spoken to is behind him&quot;) and Clive Everton.

In 2012, improved medication allowed Small to return to coaching, one of his players being former snooker professional Michael Leslie.

==Personal life==
Small is the son of a taxi driver. He worked as a bank clerk before his success in snooker. Small and his wife Clare have four children.

<doc id="637044" wikidata="Q5447266" url="?curid=637044" title="Fierce!">
<text>Fierce! is an international performance festival (previously produced by Fierce Earth) that has taken place annually in and around Birmingham, England since 1997.

The launch of the 2004 festival, in May in Birmingham, England, was a group of hot air balloons that drifted over Birmingham&#x27;s streets in the early hours of the morning playing soft music to &quot;encourage dreams related to the music&quot;.

In May 2007, the artwork Una White was created as part of the festival.

Fierce! 11 was held over the May Bank Holiday, 23 to 26 May 2008 and the artists taking part in the festival were chosen by way of a public vote. The voting commenced on 20 March 2008 and concluded on 11 April 2008.

The Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Warwick Arts Centre and Birmingham Hippodrome also collaborate heavily in the events.

In 2011 Fierce Festival reappeared after several years absence under the new joint artistic direction of Laura McDermott and Harun Morrison with the tagline &#x27;Live Art. Collision. Super Local. Hyper Now.&#x27;

In 2013 Fierce launched Club Fierce XXX featuring New York rapper Cakes Da Killa grime MC Roxxxan, and electro punk satirist Quilla Constance.

In 2016, Aaron Wright became Artistic Director and the first festival under his leadership took place in 2017.

In 2019 The Guardian Newspaper gave the Festival five stars and described it as &#x27;a daring whirl of theatrical thrills&#x27;

In 2024, after seven successful years, Aaron Wright left Fierce to become Head of Performance and Dance at the Southbank Centre and Clayton Lee become Director (Artistic) of Fierce alongside co-directors Pippa Frith (Producing) and Catherine Groom (Operations).

During his directorship Aaron led three outstanding editions of Fierce Festival in 2017, 2019 and 2022. In 2022 Aaron led special Fierce projects, &quot;Key to the City&quot;, a major participatory public realm artwork by Paul Ramírez Jonas and &quot;The Healing Gardens of Bab&quot;, a three-week programme exploring colonialism and queerness, as part of Birmingham 2022 Festival for the [[2022 Commonwealth Games|Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games]].

Fierce festival has also presented performances by numerous artists including Ron Athey, Franko B, Gob Squad, Tim Miller, Forced Entertainment and more.

<doc id="637047" wikidata="Q302872" url="?curid=637047" title="Treorchy">
<text>Treorchy (; ) is a town and community (and electoral ward) in Wales. Once a mining town, it retains such characteristics. Situated in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf in the Rhondda Fawr valley. Treorchy is also one of the 16 communities of the Rhondda. It includes the villages of Cwmparc and Ynyswen.

==History==
Prior to industrialisation, most of the land was owned by one of the great families of Glamorgan with Treorchy coming under the domain of the Marquess of Bute Estate. The discovery of coal transformed the area. The period following 1851 saw Treorchy becoming an industrial town. The town grew around the coal mining industry during the late 19th and early 20th century, but by the end of the 20th century all the local pits had closed, creating an economic downturn in the community.

Treorchy had been established when the Abergorki Colliery, situated in Cwm Orci to the north, was opened as a level in 1859 by a Mr Huxham, a former manager of the Bute Merthyr Colliery. This was sold to J. H. Insole of Cymmer in 1862. The first deep mine in Treorchy was sunk in the 1860s by David Davies of Llandinam who would later own the Ocean Coal Company. The initial development of the town was linear, based on the main road through the valley, but by 1875 a grid pattern of streets was emerging.

==Language==
The pre-industrial Rhondda community was Welsh-speaking, and the Welsh language continued to be widely spoken in the valley and in the upper villages of the Rhondda until the mid-twentieth century. The original migrants to the Rhondda were from rural Wales but later a higher proportion came from England. In 1901 64.4% of the population of the Rhondda Urban District were recorded as Welsh-speaking but this proportion fell to 56.6% by 1911.

Ysgol Gymraeg Ynyswen, a Welsh-medium primary school, is situated in the nearby village of Ynyswen. Established in 1950, it was the first Welsh-medium school in the Rhondda. It serves Treorchy and the surrounding villages, including Treherbert, Cwmparc, Penyrenglyn and Blaencwm.

==Governance==
The Treorchy electoral ward is coterminous with the borders of the Treorchy community and elects three county councillors to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. Since 1995 representation has been by either the Labour Party or Plaid Cymru. Since 2008 the ward has had three Plaid Cymru representatives.

A 2018 review of electoral arrangements by the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales would see Treorchy&#x27;s representation reduced from three to two councillors. The proposals would take effect from the 2022 council elections.

==Economy==
After being a town whose employment relied almost entirely on coal mining in the Abergorki, Tylecoch, Parc and Dare collieries, by the end of the 1970s all of these collieries had closed. Treorchy became a commuter village, with the working population seeking employment in the larger towns and cities nearby, such as Cardiff and Bridgend. Employment in Treorchy is now mostly in retail.

In 2020, Treorchy was named by the Great British High Street Awards as the UK High Street of the Year, succeeding 2019 winner and fellow Welsh town Crickhowell. It was praised for the number of independent shops in the town, and for organising a number of events, from Christmas parades to arts festivals, as well as a gay pride gathering which was a first for the area. The Guardian reported that the town has grown its chamber of trade from 30 members to 120, and nearly 30 businesses have opened in recent years, producing an occupancy rate of 96%. The town has a number of cafes, pubs, and shops on its high street.

==Religion==
In its early days as an industrial settlement, Treorchy was considered a nonconformist stronghold, with many chapels, the largest of which was Noddfa, a Welsh Baptist chapel which could seat upwards of a thousand people and which had a proud choral tradition.

==Education==
Treorchy has two main schools: Treorchy Primary School and Treorchy Comprehensive. The primary school is not on the original site of Treorchy Boys and Treorchy Girls schools, but is built 100m further along Glyncoli Road. It is built to the original plans used on many of the older schools in the upper Rhondda.

Treorchy Comprehensive school was built on the old site of the Tylecoch colliery. Its western athletics track was named the &quot;Red Ash&quot;, being the remnants of the mine shaft. This was removed in 2006 to build an astroturf sportsfield. The school is officially 500m from the main gate to the rear gate, and runs from Chepstow Road, Cwmparc, to the Tylecoch Bridge, Treorchy.

== Transport ==

The A4061 over the Bwlch y Clawdd Pass leads to Bridgend, via the Ogmore Vale, and to Maesteg and Port Talbot. Within the Rhondda Fawr Valley, the A4061 runs northwards to the top of the valley at Treherbert and ultimately, Hirwaun. The route on the A4058 southwards follows the valley&#x27;s course to Llwynypia, Tonypandy, Porth and Pontypridd to join the A470 for Cardiff.

Treorchy railway station is located on the Rhondda Line, with regular services to Treherbert and Cardiff Central run by Transport for Wales.

Treorchy is served by buses operated by Stagecoach running to Blaenrhondda, Blaencwm, Treherbert, Tonypandy, Porth, Pontypridd and Caerphilly. On summer Sundays, Veolia provides a service to Bridgend (via the Ogmore Valley) and Brecon.

==Culture==

Attractions in the town include the Parc and Dare Hall, home of the Treorchy Male Choir and the Parc and Dare band. The hall also provides entertainment as a venue for cinema, theatre and pantomime, and for school eisteddfodau and other performances.

Treorchy hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1928, the only time the event has been held in the Rhondda.

==Sport==
Treorchy RFC is the rugby union club, nicknamed the Zebras.

Treorchy also has 6 tennis courts, situated in Ystradfechan Park, and is the home of the Rhondda Lawn Tennis Club.

Upper Rhondda Cricket Club play on Ystradfechan Fields in Treorchy. The club was founded in 2002 when Blaenrhondda CC and Treorchy CC merged, they also have a women&#x27;s side which was the first women&#x27;s cricket team in the Rhondda when they started in 2019.

<text>At the [[1924 Winter Olympics]], one individual [[ski jumping]] event was contested. It was held on Monday 4 February 1924.

The event was unusual in that the bronze medalist was not determined for fifty years. Thorleif Haug of Norway was awarded third place at the event&#x27;s conclusion, but a clerical error in calculating Haug&#x27;s score was discovered in 1974 by Jacob Vaage, who further determined Anders Haugen of the United States, who had finished fourth, had actually scored 0.095 points more than Haug. The International Olympic Committee verified this, and in Oslo in September 1974, Haug&#x27;s daughter presented the medal to the 85-year-old Haugen.

<text>Sir Yehuda Edwin &quot;Honest Ed&quot; Mirvish, (July 24, 1914 – July 11, 2007) was an American-Canadian businessman, philanthropist and theatrical impresario who lived in Toronto, Ontario. He is known for his flagship business, Honest Ed&#x27;s, a landmark discount store in downtown Toronto, and as a patron of the arts, instrumental in revitalizing the theatre scene in Toronto.

==Biography==
Born in Colonial Beach, Virginia, the son of Jewish immigrants from Lithuania (his father, David) and Austria (his mother, Anna). His parents gave him the Hebrew name, Yehuda, but at the urging of a cousin, they added a more American name, Edwin. Mirvish often told the tale of his bris; there was no mohel in Colonial Beach, so the family hired one in nearby Washington, D.C., to come down to perform the ceremony. The mohel chosen was Rabbi Moshe Reuben Yoelson, the father of Al Jolson. Mirvish credited this as his introduction to show business.

The family later moved to Washington, D.C., where Mirvish&#x27;s father opened a grocery store. The grocery store went bankrupt in 1923, and David Mirvish moved his family to Toronto where he worked as a door-to-door salesman – peddling, among other things, Fuller Brushes and the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry – until he opened a grocery in the Toronto Jewish community, on Dundas Street. The family lived above the store, sharing their tiny apartment with a Hebrew school. Mirvish would often joke that it was his dream in those days to someday have a bathroom he did not have to share with 50 others.

Mirvish lost his father at the age of 15. He dropped out of school to manage the store, becoming the sole support of his mother, his younger brother, Robert (who became a successful novelist and short-story writer) and sister, Lorraine. The grocery business did not do well, and Mirvish closed shop to reopen as a dry-cleaner, in partnership with his childhood friend, Yale Simpson. The shop was known as Simpson&#x27;s. When the well-known downtown Toronto department store Simpson&#x27;s attempted to force him to change the name of his business, Mirvish pointed to Simpson and said, &quot;Here&#x27;s my Mr. Simpson. Where&#x27;s yours?&quot; The dry-cleaning business did no better than the grocery, however, and Mirvish soon abandoned it to take a regular job working as a produce manager and buyer for Toronto grocery store entrepreneur Leon Weinstein. Now financially stable, Mirvish bought a Ford Model T and began to court a radio singer from Hamilton, Ontario, Anne Macklin, whom he married in 1941. In 1945, their son, David, was born.

In 1943, during World War II, Ed and Anne Mirvish opened a dress shop known as The Sport Bar on Bloor Street near Bathurst. In 1946, the business expanded and was renamed Anne &amp; Eddie&#x27;s. In 1948, Mirvish cashed in his wife&#x27;s insurance policy to open a new business, a bargain basement known as &quot;Honest Ed&#x27;s&quot;, stocked with all kinds of odd merchandise purchased at bankruptcy and fire sales, and displayed on orange crates. This unique no-credit, no-service, no-frills business model was an immediate success. Mirvish claimed to have invented the &quot;loss-leader&quot;, below-cost discounts on selected items designed to lure buyers into the store. &quot;Honest Ed&#x27;s&quot; gradually expanded to fill an entire city block. Billing itself as &quot;the world&#x27;s biggest discount department store&quot;, it was soon bringing in millions of dollars a year. The store expanded and, in the late 1950s, Mirvish started buying up houses on Markham Street running south from Bloor. When his application to tear down the Victorian structures to build a parking lot was rejected by the city Mirvish, at the urging of his wife, rented them out at low rates to local artists and the street soon became a community of artists studios, galleries, boutiques and niche shops known today as Mirvish Village.

In June 2006, Ed and Anne Mirvish marked their 65th wedding anniversary with a party at the Princess of Wales Theatre. The mayor of Toronto, the chief of police and other public figures delivered congratulatory speeches, followed by a program of vocal music by some of Toronto&#x27;s opera and theater stars. In July 2006, Mirvish celebrated his 92nd birthday with a lavish party at Honest Ed&#x27;s. In honor of this occasion, many items in the store were on sale for 92 cents.

On July 11, 2007, the Mirvish family released a statement to announce the death of Ed Mirvish after midnight at St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital, Toronto, at age 92. The funeral service was held at the Beth Tzedek Synagogue in Toronto. Mirvish was buried at Pardes Shalom Cemetery in Maple, Ontario. His store was closed and its lights were dimmed, as staff bid farewell to the former owner. A similar gesture was made by theatres on Broadway, which dimmed their lights for one minute at 8 pm on July 13. Toronto Police provided ceremonial and mounted units (including the horse Honest Ed) for his funeral. Flags at Toronto&#x27;s civic centres were lowered to half mast.

On August 12, 2007, the City of Toronto had granted a closure of Bloor Street between Bathurst and Markham Streets to accommodate a celebration in honour of Ed Mirvish. Ceremonies began with Mayor David Miller, who proclaimed August 12 &quot;Ed Mirvish Day&quot; in the City of Toronto.

In response to his death, Jones Cane Sugar Soda issued bottles of their soda with a picture of Honest Ed on them, with &quot;Honest Ed Mirvish 1914–2007&quot; placed where normally a photo credit lies.

==Publicity stunts==
Mirvish was renowned for his publicity stunts, doing everything from riding elephants, to hiring protesters to picket his own restaurant over its dress code. Every Christmas, Mirvish gave away ten thousand pounds of free turkeys in his store to shoppers who stood in line for hours. The giveaway continued each Christmas until 2015.
 A tradition since his 75th birthday has been the annual birthday bash outside the store, with free food, entertainment and children&#x27;s rides. In 2003, Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman proclaimed Mirvish&#x27;s birthday &quot;Ed Mirvish Day&quot;.

At one time, a sign in the store read: &quot;When Ed dies, he would like a catered funeral with accordion players and a buffet table, with a replica of Honest Ed on it made of potato salad.&quot;

==Theatres and restaurants==

In addition to Honest Ed&#x27;s, Mirvish was known in Toronto for his theatres and restaurants. His first purchase was the Royal Alexandra Theatre, an Edwardian Beaux-Arts landmark building potentially slated for demolition. Mirvish purchased the building in 1963 and refurbished it, revitalizing the Toronto theatre scene.

To liven up the neighborhood and provide patrons with a place to go before and after performances, Mirvish bought and renovated a nearby warehouse building, which he turned into a restaurant. To cut costs, &quot;Ed&#x27;s Warehouse&quot; at King Street West and Duncan Street served a set meal: prime rib, mashed potatoes and peas. Along the same street, Mirvish later opened Ed&#x27;s Seafood (276 King Street West), Ed&#x27;s Folly (268 King Street West), Ed&#x27;s Chinese, Ed&#x27;s Italian Restaurant and Old Ed&#x27;s or Ed&#x27;s Warehouse (Edwardian style warehouse at 266 King Street West or also as Reid Building built 1904 by Alexander Frank Wickson for Featherbone Novelty Manufacturing Company), which attracted local residents to the previously neglected King Street area and served 6,000 meals a night. As the neighbourhood became revitalized, many other restaurants opened nearby, often serving a wider range of foods than Ed&#x27;s restaurants and achieving greater popularity; consequently, one by one, Ed&#x27;s restaurants closed down. The last was Ed&#x27;s Warehouse, which shut its doors in 2000.

In 1993 the Mirvishes built the Princess of Wales Theatre, the largest new theatre – and first privately financed theatre – in North America in the span of thirty years. In 2001, Mirvish Enterprises signed a management contract to run the Pantages Theatre, renamed the Canon Theatre, for Clear Channel Entertainment (now Live Nation), which had bought up the assets of the bankrupt theatre company, Livent. The first show under the Mirvish banner was a touring production of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.

He and his son David operated Mirvish Productions, which staged major touring theatre productions from Broadway and London and which produced and/or co-produced the Canadian stagings of such recent hits as &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, &quot;The Producers&quot; and &quot;Hairspray&quot;. In 1982 Ed and David Mirvish bought London&#x27;s Old Vic for £550,000 stg (Can$1.23 million) and spent four million dollars renovating it. Under their management, The Old Vic was celebrated for winning more awards for its productions than any other single theatre in Britain; It never made money, however, and they sold it to its present owners, a theatre trust, in 1998. Ed Mirvish was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for saving the Old Vic.

On December 6, 2011 the Canon Theatre was renamed Ed Mirvish Theatre in his honour.

<text>Nigel Bond (born 15 November 1965) is an English retired professional snooker player.

Bond competed on the main tour from 1989 to 2022, and was ranked within the world&#x27;s top 16 players between 1992 and 1999, peaking at 5th for the 1996–97 season. He reached the final of the World Championship in 1995, where he lost 9–18 to Stephen Hendry. He won the 1996 British Open, defeating John Higgins 9–8.

Having reached three other ranking tournament finals, Bond won the 2011 Snooker Shoot-Out and, in 2012, defeated Tony Chappel to win the World Seniors Championship. He fell off the tour following his loss to Lukas Kleckers in the second qualifying round for the 2022 World Championship, and subsequently announced his retirement.

==Career==
Bond was born in Darley Dale, Derbyshire.

After a strong amateur career, Bond turned professional for the 1989–90 season. He reached his first ranking semi-final in his first season, and his first final in his second season, but his career peaked in the mid-1990s. In the first round of the 1994 World Championship, he pulled off one of the biggest comebacks in the event&#x27;s history, rallying from 2–9 to defeat Cliff Thorburn 10–9 in what turned out to be Thorburn&#x27;s last appearance at the Crucible. A year later, Bond reached the final after beating Stephen Lee, Alan McManus, Gary Wilkinson and Andy Hicks, but lost to Stephen Hendry 9–18. As a consequence of reaching the final, he climbed to number five in the world rankings for the 1996–97 season, and in that same season he acquired his only ranking tournament victory, the British Open, beating John Higgins 9–8 after needing a snooker in the final frame. He won the World Snooker Association Performance of the Year award for this achievement, although he then failed to maintain this level of performance.

He reached at least the quarter-finals at the Crucible Theatre every year from 1993 to 1996, losing to Hendry every time, which added extra spice to their first-round match in 2006. After leading comfortably throughout the early stages of the match, Bond was pegged back to 7–7 and the match went to a final frame. With only the black remaining, and seven points up, Bond clipped it into the left corner pocket, only for the cue ball to go in the right middle pocket, resulting in a re-spotted black (the first one ever to decide the final frame of a World Championship match), which Bond potted to take frame and match. The final score was 10–9, Bond&#x27;s first win at the Crucible since 1999, and his only last-16 run of that season.

By the end of the 1990s, he was out of the top 16, and dropped out of the top 32 for the 2004–05 season. However, he reclaimed his place a year later, and remained there until 2010. In the 2007 World Championship he lost in the first round, 7–10 to Peter Ebdon.

A run to the last 16 of the 2007 UK Championship, in which he came from 5–7 to win 9–7 against Ken Doherty in the last 32 before losing 6–9 to Ding Junhui in the last 16, was a precursor to Bond&#x27;s first quarter-final run for five years, at the China Open. Victories over David Roe, Stephen Lee and Barry Pinches took him to a meeting with Stephen Maguire, who whitewashed him 5–0.

He opened the 2008–09 season with first-round defeats in the first five tournaments, but victory over Ebdon in the first round of the World Championship ensured that he held his top-32 status. This was, however, his last appearance at the main stages of the World Championship.

On 30 January 2011, Bond won the Snooker Shoot-Out event. This involved the top 64 players in the world playing 10-minute matches decided on a single frame. He picked up the £32,000 prize money as well as the Snooker Shoot-Out trophy, beating Robert Milkins 58–24 in the final.

He made a good start to the 2011–12 season by qualifying for the first two ranking event tournaments, the Australian Goldfields Open and the Shanghai Masters. He lost to Neil Robertson and Mark Selby respectively in the first round.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also qualified for the World Open, but was defeated by amateur player Lu Ning in the wildcard round. Bond finished the season ranked world number 45.

He once again qualified for the Australian Goldfields Open in the 2012–13 season, but lost to Robertson 1–5 in the last 32.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In December, he reached the World Open in Haikou, China, with wins over Jimmy White and Jamie Burnett. At the venue he saw off Zhu Yinghui 5–3 in the wildcard round and received a bye through to the last 16 due to the withdrawal of Ali Carter. There he lost 1–5 to Judd Trump. Bond was also crowned World Seniors champion during the season without dropping a frame in a total of seven matches, concluding with a 2–0 victory against Tony Chappel in the final. His season ended when he was beaten 8–10 by McManus in the third round of World Championship Qualifying. He dropped a solitary place during the year to end it ranked world number 46.

He reached the final of the World Seniors Championship for the second year in a row in the 2013–14 season, losing 1–2 to Steve Davis. He only won two matches at the main venue of ranking events all season, his best run coming in the China Open, where he beat Pinches 5–2 before losing to Selby 1–5 in the last 32.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He fell 11 spots from the start of the season to end it as the world number 57.

He produced a comeback in the second round of the 2014 UK Championship, as from 0–5 down against world number five Barry Hawkins he took six successive frames to advance. However, in the third round Anthony McGill recovered from 1–4 down to eliminate him 6–5. The furthest Bond could progress in a ranking event this season was at the Indian Open, where he beat Ryan Day 4–1 and Dechawat Poomjaeng 4–3, before losing 1–4 to Chris Wakelin in the last 16. He fell just outside the top 64 at the end of the year as he was ranked 65th, but he earned a two-year extension via the European Order of Merit.

At the 2016 Indian Open, Bond defeated Ricky Walden 4–1, Sam Baird 4–2, John Astley 4–2 and Ebdon 4–3 to reach his first ranking event semi-final since 2002, where he lost 1–4 to Kyren Wilson. He had started practising at the Snooker Academy in Sheffield with young Chinese players and stated that this has contributed to him regaining the hunger and passion to play snooker. He would have a losing run of 10 successive matches shortly afterwards, but at the Gibraltar Open he beat five players to reach his second semi-final of the season, where he failed to pick up a frame in a defeat to Shaun Murphy. Bond kept his place on the tour through the one-year ranking list.

Bond made a surprise run to the quarter-finals of the 2019 UK Championship at the age of 54 winning a number of close matches. He defeated future world champion Luca Brecel 6–5 in his opening round followed by another 6–5 win over Louis Heathcote. His greatest victory en route to the quarter-finals was a 6–3 win against reigning world champion and world number 1 Judd Trump in the last 32 having trailed 3–1. Bond lost 6–5 to Mark Allen in the quarter-finals having led Allen 3–1.

== Personal life ==
Bond has a son called Matthew with his wife Karen.

<doc id="637055" wikidata="Q753636" url="?curid=637055" title="Figure skating at the 1924 Winter Olympics">
<text>Figure skating at the 1924 Winter Olympics took place at the Stade Olympique in Chamonix, France, from 29 to 31 January 1924. Three figure skating events were contested: men&#x27;s singles, ladies&#x27; singles, and pair skating.

This was not the first time that figure skating had been contested at the Olympic Games, as the sport had previously been included on the programme at the 1908 and 1920 Summer Olympics. Gillis Grafström successfully defended his 1920 title.

At the 1924 Winter Olympics, the figure skating events were held on a square rink rather than a rectangular one, as a last-minute change. Consequently, some competitors had difficulty adjusting their free skating programs to fit the ice surface.

<text>Tonypandy (, ) is a town, community and electoral ward located in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan, Wales, lying in the Rhondda Fawr Valley. A former industrial coal mining town, the town was the scene of the 1910 Tonypandy riots.

The community boundaries of Tonypandy are drawn relatively tightly around the central part of the urban area. According to the 2011 UK Census, the population of the community was 3,750. The Office for National Statistics defines a larger &quot;Tonypandy built-up area&quot; covering much of the Rhondda Fawr valley and the lower Rhondda Fach valley, which had a population of 62,545 in 2011. They also define a smaller &quot;Tonypandy built-up area sub division&quot; which had a population of 17,789.

The town is served by Tonypandy railway station on the Rhondda Line.

==Toponymy==
Tonypandy means &quot;fulling mill lea&quot;, from Welsh &quot;ton&quot; (archaic &quot;tonnau&quot;) for lea, layland, pasture, grassland or unploughed land; &quot;pannu&quot; for fulling and &quot;tŷ&quot; for house (cf. ). (See also Tonna.)

== History ==
===Pre-industrial===
The Tonypandy area contains several prehistoric sites, the main one being Mynydd y Gelli. Located to the north-west of the town, the remains of an Iron Age settlement Hen Dre&#x27;r Gelli lies on the slopes of Mynydd Y Gelli hill between Tonypandy and Gelli. Near the same location are several Bronze Age cairns.

Tonypandy is also the site of one of two permanent Middle Ages fortifications found within the Rhondda Valley. Named Ynysygrug, it was a lesser motte and bailey earthwork defence consisting of a wooden tower surrounded by a small fortified courtyard. Built around the 12th or early 13th century, the remains of the fortification were mostly destroyed during railway construction works in the 19th century. The fortification was for many years wrongly thought to be the burial place of Rhys ap Tewdwr or a druidic worship site.

The regional library service recounts that the name &#x27;Tonypandy&#x27; means &quot;the meadow of the fulling mill&quot; which was established there in 1838. &quot;E. D. Lewis in his work &quot;The Rhondda Valleys&quot; provides us with an outline history of the mill that once stood in Tonypandy, and from which the town took its name&quot;.

===Industrial era===
In the mid-19th century, the Rhondda began its industrial transformation after the successful excavation of coal. With the extension of the Taff Vale Railway to Treherbert and Maerdy in 1856, the Rhondda grew as absentee landlords switched their interests from farming to mining. The Tonypandy riots of 1910 and 1911 were a series of violent confrontations between coal miners and police that took place at various locations in and around the Rhondda mines of the Cambrian Combine, a cartel of mining companies in South Wales. Tonypandy, unlike the surrounding villages, then grew as a financial and social hub, providing services and amenities for the neighbouring communities. 

==Sports and recreation==
In the early part of the 20th century, Tonypandy was home to Mid-Rhondda RLFC, one of the first Welsh rugby league teams. Although surviving only one season, the club transformed into Mid-Rhondda AFC, one of the most notable association football teams the Rhondda has produced. Both Mid-Rhondda teams played at the Athletic Ground, now known as &quot;the Mid&quot; . The pitch is notable as having hosted the first international match between the Wales and England rugby league teams on 20 April 1908. It was also used as the opening venue for the 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, when the visiting Australian rugby league team began its campaign with a match against Mid-Rhondda.

When the Mid-Rhondda RLFC collapsed in 1909, the committee refocused on creating an association football team. In 1912 Mid Rhondda F.C. was formed, winning the South League Second Division in 1919–20.

==Governance==

In 1988 Tonypandy became a county electoral ward to Mid Glamorgan County Council, electing one county councillor in 1989 and 1993. Tonypandy Town Hall was erected as a theatre in 1892. 

Since 1995 Tonypandy has been a ward, coterminous with the community boundaries, which elects a county borough councillor to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. In 2012 the electorate was 2,739.

At every Rhondda Cynon Taf election the seat has been won by the Labour Party, apart from the 1999 election when then ward was won by Plaid Cymru. Between 2004 and 2017 the Labour councillor was Craig Middle and, since May 2017, the councillor has been Gareth Wyn Hughes.

<doc id="637057" wikidata="Q894094" url="?curid=637057" title="Borough of Stockton-on-Tees">
<text>The Borough of Stockton-on-Tees is a unitary authority area in England with borough status in County Durham and North Yorkshire. In 2021, it had a population of 196,600. Its main settlement and namesake of the borough is Stockton-on-Tees, which lies on the north bank of the River Tees, along with the towns of Billingham and Norton-on-Tees, in County Durham. It also includes the towns of Ingleby Barwick, Thornaby-on-Tees and Yarm, all south of the Tees, in North Yorkshire. The borough locally governed by Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council. The borough forms part of the Tees Valley together with four other nearby boroughs (Darlington, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Hartlepool).

All bridges spanning the River Tees are partially within the borough, including the Yarm Viaduct and the Tees Transporter Bridge, with the Middlesbrough to the south downstream on the other side to the east of the borough. 

Teesside International Airport is shared between the borough and the Darlington.

==History==

===Municipal authority===
Stockton previously held borough status as the Municipal Borough of Stockton-on-Tees in historic County Durham.

===Loss of status===

In 1968, the borough was merged into Teesside County Borough; this civil parish was a part of the ceremonial (not administrative) North Riding county until its abolition.

===District authority===

The town regained borough status on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972. It became a non-metropolitan district of the County of Cleveland, itself established at the same time. Multiple parishes and boroughs merged into Stockton&#x27;s newly formed district borough:
*Teesside County Borough&#x27;s area covering the former Stockton, Billingham and Thornaby municipal boroughs,
*Hilton, Ingleby Barwick, Kirklevington, Maltby, and Yarm parishes of the previous North Riding County-administered Stokesley Rural District, and
*Part of the County Durham-administered Stockton Rural District parishes.

===Unitary authority===

The borough became a unitary authority on 1 April 1996. It is ceremonially split between County Durham and North Yorkshire, to the north and south of the Tees respectively. It is the only council in England to be split between two ceremonial counties. The former districts and boroughs of Durham now form the unitary authority of County Durham, so ceremonial County Durham now has four unitary authorities.

==Economy==
The Office for National Statistics has published a chart (pp. 240–253) of the trend of regional gross value of Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees (figures in Sterling [millions]).
 includes hunting and forestry.

 includes energy and construction.

 includes financial intermediation services indirectly measured.

 Components may not sum to totals due to rounding.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 census, the borough was recorded as having a population of 196,595 with 50.9% being female.

For sexuality, those who identified as Straight or Heterosexual were 91.6%, Gay or Lesbian were 1.4%, Bisexual was 0.9%, Pansexual was 0.2%, Asexual was 0.0%, Queer was 0.0, &#x27;All other sexual orientations&#x27; were 0.0% and those who did not answer were 5.9%.

[Note, for percentages with 0.0%, this may due to a number too low to represent using the number of digits supplied rather than a lack of those who identified as that specific idea]
== Local Nature Reserves ==
The council maintains a number of local nature reserves including Barwick Pond, Charlton&#x27;s Pond, Greenvale, Hardwick Dene and Elm Tree Woods, Norton Grange Marsh, Quarry Wood (Eaglescliffe), and Stillington Forest Park.

<text>Mark Ryden (born January 20, 1963) is an American painter who is considered to be part of the Lowbrow (or pop surrealist) art movement. He was dubbed &quot;the god-father of pop surrealism&quot; by &quot;Interview&quot; magazine. In 2015, Artnet named Ryden and his wife, painter Marion Peck, the king and queen of Pop Surrealism.

Ryden has been described as a &quot;relentless kitsch meister working in the tradition of Bosch, Dalí, and Little Golden Books&quot; and a master of Lowbrow style. His work has been described as having a pop-surrealist style that contains a nightmarish quality. His inspirations include &quot;old children’s books, interesting product packages, toys, photographs, medical models, skeletons, shells, minerals, and religious statues.&quot; His album and single artwork for musicians includes Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot; (1989), Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous&quot; (1991), Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; (1995), Tyler, the Creator&#x27;s &quot;Wolf&quot; (2013).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ryden was born in Medford, Oregon on January 20, 1963, to Barbara and Keith Ryden, and was raised in Southern California. His father was a painter who also restored and customized cars. He has two sisters and two brothers: his brother Keyth is also an artist and works under the name KRK. Ryden graduated from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena in 1987.

===Early career (1988–1998)===
From 1988 to 1998, Ryden worked as a commercial artist. During this period, he created album covers for prominent musicians, including Danger Danger’s debut eponymous album; Warrant&#x27;s debut album &quot;Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich&quot;; Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous&quot;; the 4 Non Blondes&#x27; &quot;Bigger, Better, Faster, More!&quot;; the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;One Hot Minute&quot;; Scarling.’s &quot;Sweet Heart Dealer&quot; and their alternative vinyl cover of &quot;So Long, Scarecrow&quot;; Jack Off Jill&#x27;s &quot;Clear Hearts Grey Flowers&quot;; the Screaming Trees&#x27; &quot;Uncle Anesthesia&quot;; Marcy Playground&#x27;s &quot;Shapeshifter&quot;; and Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;. He also created book covers, including the Stephen King novels &quot;Desperation&quot; and &quot;The Regulators&quot;. In 1994, Robert Williams featured Ryden&#x27;s work on the cover of &quot;Juxtapoz&quot;, a magazine devoted to &quot;lowbrow art&quot;, which helped launch Ryden to greater success.

===Exhibitions and major projects (1998–present)===
==== The Meat Show ====

Ryden&#x27;s solo debut show entitled &quot;The Meat Show&quot; was in Pasadena, California in 1998. Meat is a recurring theme in his work. In a 2010 interview, Ryden stated, &quot;There seems to be a complete disconnect between meat as food and the living, breathing creature it comes from. I suppose it is this contradiction that brings me to return to meat in my art.&quot;

==== Wondertoonel ====

A mid-career retrospective, &quot;Wondertoonel&quot;, which refers to a cabinet of curiosities or Wunderkammer (&quot;wonder-room&quot;), was co-organized in 2004 by the Frye Art Museum in Seattle and the Pasadena Museum of California Art. It was the best-attended exhibition since the Frye Art Museum opened in 1952, and broke attendance records in Pasadena. Debra Byrne, then-curator of the Frye, placed Ryden&#x27;s work in the camp of the carnivalesquea strain of visual culture rooted in such works as Hieronymous Bosch’s &quot;Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;.

==== The Tree Show ====

In 2007, &quot;The Tree Show&quot; opened at the Michael Kohn Gallery, Los Angeles. In this show, Ryden explored the contemporary human experience of nature. He explained, &quot;Some people look at these massive trees and feel a sort of spiritual awe looking at them, and then other people just want to cut them up and sell them, they only see a commodity&quot;. Ryden has created limited editions of his art to raise money for the Sierra Club and Nature Conservancy.

==== The Snow Yak Show ====
In 2009, Ryden&#x27;s exhibition &quot;The Snow Yak Show&quot; was shown at the Tomio Koyama Gallery in Tokyo.

==== The Gay 90s: Olde Tyme Art Show ====

In 2010, &quot;The Gay lord 90s: Olde Tyme Art Show&quot; debuted at Paul Kasmin Gallery in New York. The central theme of the show referenced the idealism and sentimentalism of the 1890s while addressing the role of kitsch and nostalgia in current culture. Ryden explored the line between attraction and repulsion to kitsch. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Ryden’s pictures hint at the psychic stuff that pullulates beneath the sentimental, nostalgic and naïve surface of modern kitsch.&quot;

==== The Tree of Life ====
Ryden&#x27;s &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; painting was included in the exhibition &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Museum, Los Angeles Artists 1980-2010&quot; at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA). The exhibition showcased artists who helped shape the artistic dialogue in Los Angeles since MOCA&#x27;s 1980 founding. 

==== The Gay Nineties Olde Tyme Music ====
On May 13, 2014, Ryden released an album titled &quot;The Gay Nineties Olde Tyme Music: Daisy Bell&quot;, featuring Tyler, the Creator, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Katy Perry, Stan Ridgway of Wall Of Voodoo, Danny Elfman, Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo, Nick Cave, Scarling., Kirk Hammett of Metallica, and Everlast. All performed a different rendition of the same song, &quot;Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two).&quot; The proceeds from the signed and limited edition record benefited Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit that supports musical education in disadvantaged elementary schools.

==== Whipped Cream ====
Ryden developed costumes and sets for a two-act ballet titled &quot;Whipped Cream&quot;, which premiered in March 2017 at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa, California. The ballet was created by choreographer Alexei Ratmansky for the American Ballet Theatre. It is a story about a young boy who overindulges at a Vienna pastry shop and falls into a surreal delirium. With libretto and music by Richard Strauss, the ballet, originally titled &quot;Schlagobers&quot;, was first performed by the Vienna State Opera in 1924.

==== The Mark Ryden x Barbie Collection ====

In 2022, it was announced that Ryden had designed a series of limited-edition Barbies and accessories for Mattel. Mattel Creations and Kasmin Gallery held an exhibition of Ryden&#x27;s work and the dolls from November 11 to December 12, 2022. Also on display was Ryden&#x27;s first depiction of Barbie, a 1994 oil painting of a girl praying to Barbie, titled &quot;Saint Barbie&quot;. 

==Personal life==
Ryden has two children, Rosie and Jasper. In 2009, he married artist Marion Peck in the Pacific Northwest rainforest. He resides in Portland, Oregon.

<doc id="637059" wikidata="Q3736837" url="?curid=637059" title="Honest Ed's">
<text>Honest Ed&#x27;s was a landmark discount store in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was named for its proprietor, Ed Mirvish, who opened the store in 1948 and oversaw its operations for almost 60 years until his death in 2007. The store continued to operate until it permanently closed on December 31, 2016.

==Location==
Honest Ed&#x27;s was located originally on Markham Street at the corner of Bloor. The original entrance was on Markham Street. This was done because property taxes would be higher if the store was accessed from Bloor Street. In the block between Markham and Bloor there was a Toronto Dominion Bank and a Loblaw&#x27;s groceteria which was purchased and occupied as part of the store complex in the early 1950s. When lineups formed to gain access to the store Toronto police directed the lines to go down Markham Street again, to ensure the store was taxed as a Markham Street business instead of a Bloor Street business. Throughout the store were such hand-painted slogans and enticements to buy as &quot;not cheaper anywhere else in Toronto&quot;, &quot;You cannot do without this&quot;, and &quot;Every home needs this&quot;.

Honest Ed&#x27;s was located at the corner of Bloor and Bathurst Streets, extending the full length of the block west to Markham Street. The exterior was covered with huge red and yellow signs advertising the store&#x27;s name, lit up like a theatre marquee. The store sign used 23,000 light bulbs. The outside facade was covered with puns and slogans such as &quot;Come in and get lost!&quot; and &quot;Only the floors are crooked!&quot;

The store consisted of a west building on Markham Street connected by a walkway with an east building on Bathurst Street. The interior was modest, with simple displays of low-priced merchandise from vacuum cleaners and winter coats to kitchenware, toys and grocery items. Much of the store&#x27;s decor consisted of posters and photos from old films and stage productions from Mirvish&#x27;s theatres in Toronto and London, England, and of actors and musicians who performed in them (many inscribed to Ed Mirvish). Every piece of store signage was hand-painted.

The new owners have demolished the structure as of March 2018 and intend to redevelop the of land; which also includes Mirvish Village and a stretch of retail buildings south of the Honest Ed building on Bathurst Street running down to Lennox Street, which were rented out by the Mirvishes to local businesses.

==History==
Ed and Anne Mirvish opened &quot;The Sport&#x27;s Bar&quot;, a women&#x27;s clothing store, near Bloor and Bathurst Streets in 1943, renting a property that was five metres (16&#x27;) wide. The store proved popular. In 1946, the Mirvishes expanded after acquiring several buildings along Bloor, renaming the store &quot;Anne &amp; Eddie&#x27;s&quot;. After a further expansion, Mirvish re-established the store as &quot;Honest Ed&#x27;s Bargain House&quot; in 1948, adding general household goods to the inventory. In 1952, the Mirvishes acquired their first property on Markham Street, behind the store and eventually acquired several more homes on the street with the intent of building a parking lot. Instead, this evolved into the Mirvish Village neighbourhood in the 1960s after the city turned down the store&#x27;s application to raze the buildings and Anne Mirvish persuaded her husband to rent the houses out to artists. In 1958, &quot;Honest Ed&#x27;s&quot; expanded west to Markham Street to encompass 6,000 square feet and in 1984, the Honest Ed&#x27;s annex building was completed expanding the store east to Bathurst Street.

The main building was at 581 Bloor Street West and the annex at 760 Bloor Street West with the two connected by a walkway crossing Honest Ed Alley.

Honest Ed&#x27;s gained fame for its marketing stunts, including loss leader specials. By 1968 the store was grossing $14 million annually. Mirvish&#x27;s annual turkey giveaway before Christmas always received media attention; this annual event continued even after his death, until the Christmas season of 2015. Mirvish also threw birthday parties for himself from 1988 until his death, continued since then as anniversary parties for the store itself. At the street parties, there were free cakes, meals, hot dogs, candy, and giveaways. Crowds of Torontonians turned up with their children, and stood in long lines to receive these handouts. The event was accompanied by live bands and balloons.

==Sale of property, closure, and redevelopment==
On 16 July 2013, it was announced the site of Honest Ed&#x27;s was for sale for $100 million, and the store was likely to be closed and replaced with a retail and residential building.

Until 1990, the store&#x27;s business had grown, but then started to decline about four years before Walmart entered Canada in 1994. Besides big-box stores, other impacts on Honest Ed&#x27;s business were internet shopping, the gentrification of downtown and the dispersion of the working and immigrant class to the inner suburbs of Toronto. Although the store never had a loss, its staff dwindled from 400 to 75 over the years.

Another factor in the store&#x27;s closure was David Mirvish did not have his father&#x27;s enthusiasm for the store, preferring the family theatre business. David Mirvish said: Retail &quot;wasn’t where my heart was. In the end, I would have had to decide that’s where we should have put our resources and grow. And I had other opportunities in fields I understood better.&quot;

The site&#x27;s redevelopment is expected to affect a number of businesses that lease space within the Honest Ed&#x27;s building, and a number of standalone businesses on Bathurst Street adjoining the Honest Ed&#x27;s building running south to Lennox, south of Honest Ed&#x27;s, and in Mirvish Village which are under the same property ownership. The property&#x27;s sale to Vancouver-based Westbank Properties, a luxury developer of hotels, residences and office space, was announced in October 2013, but David Mirvish announced he would rent the property from Westbank for two to three years, during which time Honest Ed&#x27;s and the Mirvish Village businesses would continue to operate until the developer decided what to do with the parcel of land.

On September 13, 2014, &quot;The Globe &amp; Mail&quot; reported the formation of a redevelopment team for the property that includes the design lead Gregory Henriquez of Vancouver&#x27;s Henriquez Partners Architects, supported by DSA Architects as AOR, ERA Heritage Architects, Janet Rosenberg &amp; Studio, Reshape Strategies, and Urban Strategies Planning The redeveloped property is to be subdivided into zones with residential rental towers, retail storefronts, new pedestrian lanes, and a woonerf on Markham Street. According to Urban Toronto, the iconic Honest Ed&#x27;s sign will not be part of the site redevelopment. The proposed redevelopment includes 1,000 rental apartments, a permanent public market; and retail space largely divided into small units that mimic the scale of storefronts on Bloor Street.

The Honest Ed&#x27;s retail store closed on December 31, 2016, and the remaining stores in Mirvish Village (Markham Street) and on properties formerly owned by Mirivish on Bathurst Street south of Honest Ed&#x27;s closed by January 31, 2017.

The iconic Honest Ed&#x27;s sign was dismantled and removed from the building on May 23, 2017, and is to be restored and installed above the Victoria Street entrance of the Ed Mirvish Theatre.

== Cultural impact ==
The store has appeared in several films and television shows shot in Toronto. For example, Honest Ed&#x27;s was featured in the film &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;, and can be seen in several background scenes in the film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; when Scott and his friends are dining at Pizza Pizza across the street from the store.

One of the fight sequences in the third volume of Bryan Lee O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot; comic book series takes place at Honest Ed&#x27;s, with the characters suffering sensory overload due to the incredible amounts of merchandise. The store implodes after Scott&#x27;s rival Todd breaks an agreement not to use his psychic powers.

The store appears in the background of Nathan Fielder&#x27;s 2008 video &quot;Side of Smooth-&#x27;Morning Walk.&#x27;&quot;

From February to March 2009, the store hosted &quot;Honest Threads&quot;, an interactive artwork by installation artist Iris Häussler, curated by Mona Filip of the Koffler Centre of the Arts. Häussler installed a boutique of clothes lent by Torontonians, each associated with a personal story. Visitors were able to borrow the garments for a few days and wear them, experiencing both literally and psychologically what it is like to &quot;walk in someone else’s shoes.&quot; This synthesis of conceptual art and commercial space was well received and reviewed widely on a national and local level and in numerous blogs. In November 2013, the Koffler Centre of the Arts produced &#x27;Honesty&#x27;, a site-specific play by playwright/director Jordan Tannahill in which performer Virgilia Griffith embodied seven real employees of the store.

Honest Ed&#x27;s was referenced by the character Zazu in the Toronto stage production of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, where a brightly coloured, patterned stage curtain is described by the character as &quot;a shower curtain from Honest Ed&#x27;s&quot;.

Honest Ed&#x27;s was featured as the setting for the music video &quot;Wide Open&quot; by Toronto singer Jenny Mayhem. In the video Jenny plays a daydreaming Honest Ed&#x27;s employee, who fantasizes about being a star. The video was directed by Ace Billet and was shot in Honest Ed&#x27;s and in other locations around Mirvish Village.

Honest Ed&#x27;s is featured prominently in an episode of the Viceland series &quot;Nirvanna the Band the Show&quot;, where the main characters Matt and Jay look for a Christmas tree to decorate their Christmas float with.

The store is the subject of Lulu Wei&#x27;s 2020 documentary film &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like This Place, Anyplace&quot;.

==Tributes==
Ed and Anne Mirvish Parkette, within the streetcar loop at Bathurst subway station, has a plaque erected in 2008 to honour the founders of Honest Ed&#x27;s mentioning the two popular annual store events: Ed&#x27;s birthday party and the turkey giveaway.

On November 1, 2016, the Toronto Transit Commission created a temporary display at Bathurst station as a tribute to Honest Ed&#x27;s. The display included hand-painted signs in the Honest Ed style including the corny puns. At the concourse level, there were photos and store memorabilia. On the subway platform walls there were signs providing facts about Honest Ed&#x27;s. The commemorative display was removed after the final closing of Honest Ed&#x27;s on December 31, 2016.

The TTC later installed a permanent tribute to Honest Ed&#x27;s on the concourse level of Bathurst station consisting of five vertical panels with images and memorabilia associated with the former department store.

A portion of the iconic Honest Ed&#x27;s sign is to be restored and moved to the Ed Mirvish Theatre at Yonge and Dundas.

A four day long goodbye party was held in the building from February 22 to 27, 2017, as a fundraiser for the Centre for Social Innovation. The celebrations included dance performances, music, installations, film, live sign painting by the original Honest Ed&#x27;s sign painter, Douglas Kerr, speakers and panel discussions on the cultural and social significance of Honest Ed&#x27;s, and an art maze.

<doc id="637066" wikidata="Q1935728" url="?curid=637066" title="Stone circle">
<text>A stone circle is a ring of megalithic standing stones. Most are found in Northwestern Europe – especially Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany – and typically date from the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, with most being built between 3300 and 2500 BC. The best known examples include those at the henge monument at Avebury, the Rollright Stones, Castlerigg, and elements within the ring of standing stones at Stonehenge. Scattered examples exist from other parts of Europe. Later, during the Iron Age, stone circles were built in southern Scandinavia.

The archetypical stone circle is an uncluttered enclosure, large enough to congregate inside, and composed of megalithic stones. Often similar structures are named &#x27;stone circle&#x27;, but these names are either historic, or incorrect. Examples of commonly misinterpreted stone circles are ring cairns, burial mounds, and kerb cairns. Although it is often assumed there are thousands of stone circles across the British Isles and Europe, such enclosures are actually very rare, and constitute a regional form of henge. Examples of true stone circles include Long Meg and Her Daughters in Cumbria, henges with inner stones such as Avebury in Wiltshire, and The Merry Maidens in Cornwall.

Stone circles are usually grouped in terms of the shape and size of the stones, the span of their radius, and their population within the local area. Although many theories have been advanced to explain their use, usually related to providing a setting for ceremony or ritual, no consensus exists among archaeologists regarding their intended function. Their construction often involved considerable communal effort, including specialist tasks such as planning, quarrying, transportation, laying the foundation trenches, and final construction.

== Dates and archaeology==
Growing evidence suggests that megalithic constructions began as early as 5000 BC in northwestern France and that the custom and techniques spread via sea routes throughout Europe and the Mediterranean region from there. The Carnac Stones in France are estimated to have been built around 4500 BC, and many of the formations include megalithic stone circles.

The earliest stone circles in Britain were erected 3200–2500 BC, during the Middle Neolithic (–2500 BC). Around that time, stone circles began to be built in the coastal and lowland areas towards the north of the United Kingdom. The Langdale axe industry in the Lake District may have been an important early centre for circle building, perhaps because of its economic power. Many had closely set stones, perhaps similar to the earth banks of henges. Others were constructed from boulders placed stably on the ground rather than standing stones held erect by a foundation trench. Recent research shows that the two oldest stone circles in Britain (Stenness on Orkney and Callanish on the Isle of Lewis) were constructed to align with solar and lunar positions.

Most sites do not contain evidence of human dwelling, suggesting that stone circles were constructed for ceremonies.
Sometimes, a stone circle is found in association with a burial pit or burial chamber, but most of these monuments have no such known association because of a lack of archaeological investigation.

==Variants==

===Recumbent and axial stone circle===


Recumbent stone circles are a variation containing a single large stone placed on its side. The stones are often ordered by height, with the tallest being the portals, with gradually reducing heights around each side of the circle, down to the recumbent stone, which is the lowest. This type is found throughout the British Isles and Brittany, with 71 examples in Scotland and at least 20 in south-west Ireland. In the latter nation they are generally called axial stone circles, including Drombeg stone circle near Rosscarbery, County Cork.

Scottish recumbent circles are usually flanked by the two largest of the standing stones immediately on either side. These are known as &#x27;flankers&#x27;. The stones are commonly graded in height with the lowest stones being diametrically opposite to the tall flankers. The circle commonly contains a ring cairn and cremation remains.

Irish axial stone circles are found in Cork and Kerry counties. These do not have tall flanking stones on either side of the recumbent stone. Instead, there are two tall stones at the side of the circle opposite the recumbent stone. These are known as &#x27;portals&#x27;, as they form an entrance into the circle. Often the portals are turned so that their flat sides face each other, rather than facing the centre of the circle.

==Distribution==

Megalithic monuments are found in especially great number on the European Atlantic fringe and in the British Isles.

===Great Britain and Ireland===


There are approximately 1300 stone circles in Britain and Ireland. Experts disagree on whether the construction of megaliths in Britain developed independently or was imported from mainland Europe.

A 2019 comprehensive radiocarbon dating study of megalithic structures across Europe and the British Isles concluded that construction techniques were spread to other communities via sea routes, starting from north-western France. In contrast, the French archaeologist Jean-Pierre Mohen in his book &quot;&quot; wrote that the British Isles are &quot;outstanding in the abundance of standing stones, and the variety of circular architectural complexes of which they formed a part ... strikingly original, they have no equivalent elsewhere in Europe – strongly supporting the argument that the builders were independent.&quot;Some theories suggest that invaders from Brittany may have been responsible for constructing Stonehenge.

Although stone circles are widely distributed across the island, Ireland has two main concentrations: in the Cork/Kerry area and in mid-Ulster. The latter typically consist of a greater number of small stones, usually high, and are often found in upland areas and on sites that also contain a stone alignment. The Cork–Kerry stone circles tend to be more irregular in shape with larger but fewer and more widely-spaced orthostats around the axial stone.

===Continental Europe===
Examples can be found throughout Continental Europe, from the Black Sea to Brittany. Locations in France include several in Brittany (two on the island of Er Lannic and two more suggested at Carnac), several in the south of France on the Causse de Blandas in the Cevennes, in the Pyrenees, and in the Alps (e.g. the Petit Saint Bernard). One notable stone circle is in the Italian Alps. As early as 1579, scholars in Germany described large erect stone circles near Ballenstedt. In 2001, a stone circle (Beglik Tash) was discovered in Bulgaria near the Black Sea.

There are several examples in the Alentejo region of Portugal, the oldest and most complete being the Almendres Cromlech near the regional capital of Évora and within its municipality. Remains of many others consist only of the central anta (as they are known in the Alentejo). This sometimes appears to have been used as an altar but more often as a central burial structure, originally surrounded by megaliths that show only sparsely survived erosion and human activities.

These circles are also known as &quot;harrespil&quot; in the Basque country, where villagers call them &quot;mairu-baratz&quot; or &quot;jentil-baratz,&quot; meaning &quot;pagan garden (cemetery)&quot;. They refer to mythological giants of the pre-Christian era. No example has survived in a good state of preservation, but, like the Alentejo, the Basque Country is dotted with eroded and vandalized examples of many such structures.

===Africa===
Ancient stone circles are found throughout the Horn of Africa. Booco in northeastern Somalia contains a number of such old structures. Small stone circles here surround two enclosed platform monuments, which are set together. The circles of stone are believed to mark associated graves.

At Emba Derho in the Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands, two kinds of megalithic circles are found. The first type consists of single stone circles, whereas the second type comprises an inner circle enclosed within a larger circle (i.e. double stone circles).
The Senegambian stone circles are found on the western side of the continent. The individual groups are dated from 700 A.D. to 1350 A.D, and 1145 sites were mapped in a 1982 study.

=== Asia ===

In the Near East, possibly the oldest stone circles in the world were found at Atlit Yam (about 8000 BC). The locality is now submerged near the Levantine Mediterranean coast.

Other locations include India or Japan. See more in the relevant Wikipedia category.

<text>The City of Chelmsford () is a local government district with borough and city status in Essex, England. It is named after its main settlement, Chelmsford, which is also the county town of Essex. As well as the settlement of Chelmsford itself, the district also includes the surrounding rural area and the town of South Woodham Ferrers.

The neighbouring districts are Uttlesford, Braintree, Maldon, Rochford, Basildon, Brentwood and Epping Forest.

==History==
Chelmsford&#x27;s first elected council was a local board of health established in 1850. This replaced a body of improvement commissioners which had previously administered the town under the Chelmsford Improvement Act 1789 (29 Geo. 3. c. 44). The local board in turn was replaced by the Chelmsford Corporation in 1888 when the town was incorporated to become a municipal borough.

The current district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering two former districts which were abolished at the same time:
*Chelmsford Municipal Borough
*Chelmsford Rural District (except the two parishes of Ingatestone and Fryerning and Mountnessing, which went to Brentwood.)
The new district was named Chelmsford after its main town. The new council was initially called &quot;Chelmsford District Council&quot;. Charter trustees were established for the area of the former municipal borough so as to allow the town to continue to have a mayor. The new district was granted borough status in 1977, changing the name of the council to &quot;Chelmsford Borough Council&quot; and allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor instead, with the charter trustees then being disbanded.

On 1 June 2012 the district was granted city status to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, and the council therefore changed its name to &quot;Chelmsford City Council&quot;.

==Governance==
Chelmsford City Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Essex County Council. Parts of the district are also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been controlled by the Liberal Democrats since the 2019 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Chelmsford. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent changes of allegiance in November 2023, the composition of the council was:

Three of the independent politicians sit together as the &quot;Chelmsford Independents Group&quot;. The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at Chelmsford Civic Centre on Duke Street in Chelmsford. The building was purpose-built for the former borough council and was opened in 1935.

==Elections==

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2003 the council has comprised 57 councillors elected from 24 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Geography==

The district has two major centres, the principal settlement Chelmsford in the centre and the town of South Woodham Ferrers to the south east. The remainder of the district is predominantly rural, with many villages and hamlets.

The River Chelmer flows into the district near North End and flows to Chelmsford where the River Can converges with it at the city centre. The River Chelmer then flows out of the district between Boreham and Little Baddow. The River Can&#x27;s source is in the north west of the district. The River Wid flows from the south of the borough through Widford towards the centre past Writtle to join the River Can between Writtle and Chelmsford. The River Crouch flows along the part of the southeastern border below South Woodham Ferrers. Hanningfield Reservoir, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is located in the south of the borough.

==Transport==
The rail links, both national and international, which run through the borough, are all operated by Greater Anglia. Two national rail services operate. The Great Eastern Main Line runs through the centre, stopping at Chelmsford railway station. Services via Chelmsford operate between London Liverpool Street and Ipswich, Clacton, Harwich, Braintree or Norwich. The Crouch Valley Line also runs through the far south-east tip of the borough, stopping at South Woodham Ferrers, running services between Wickford and Southminster.

The Amsterdam Express, a rail/sea/rail international service owned by also stops at Chelmsford, on its route between London and the Netherlands, via North Sea ferries.

There are several primary routes within the borough. One of these, the A12, is also a trunk road and runs from London and the M25, centrally in a north-easterly direction through the borough bypassing the city of Chelmsford onwards to Suffolk and Norfolk. Two other significant primary routes are the A130 which runs north-south across Essex and the A414, which begins as a primary route in Chelmsford but its terminus us Maldon in Essex. The A414 then runs west through Essex, meets the M11 and then its path continues into Hertfordshire via Harlow. Various other A- and B-Roads connect the borough, especially the city of Chelmsford to the rest of the county and beyond.

There is, additionally, a large integrated bus network provided primarily by First Essex which connects the city to towns and villages across the county. Other smaller operators also provide services, such as Stephensons of Essex and Arriva Essex.

==Parishes==
There are 29 civil parishes in the district. The former Chelmsford Municipal Borough is an unparished area, directly administered by Chelmsford City Council. The parish council for South Woodham Ferrers takes the style &quot;Town Council&quot;, whilst the parish of Mashbury has a parish meeting rather than a parish council due to its small population.

==Tourism==
Henry VIII&#x27;s former Palace of Beaulieu is situated in Boreham, now occupied by the New Hall School. Also located in the borough include the RHS Garden, Hyde Hall at Rettendon, and numerous open spaces in Chelmsford, including Admirals and Central Parks. Writtle, where Robert the Bruce is said to have married his second wife Elizabeth de Burgh in 1302, has English Royal connections, with King John building a hunting lodge there in 1211. Much of the site now lies within the grounds of Writtle College, the internationally famous centre for horticulture and agriculture. A few miles away is the village of Pleshey, where stand the ruins of a once important castle mentioned in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard II&quot;. The entire circuit of the castle walls can still be traced in the village streets. American tourists often visit the village of Springfield, Essex, the origin of &quot;Springfield&quot; as a popular place name, first giving its name to the important City of Springfield, Massachusetts, and subsequently Springfield, Illinois, the state capital of Illinois, and Springfield, Missouri, among numerous others.

<text>Despite Dutch neutrality, Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 as part of Fall Gelb (Case Yellow). On 15 May 1940, one day after the bombing of Rotterdam, the Dutch forces surrendered. The Dutch government and the royal family relocated to London. Princess Juliana and her children sought refuge in Ottawa, Canada until after the war.

German occupation lasted in some areas until the German surrender in May 1945. Active resistance, at first carried out by a minority, grew in the course of the occupation. The occupiers deported the majority of the country&#x27;s Jews to Nazi concentration camps.

Due to the high variation in the survival rate of Jewish inhabitants among local regions in the Netherlands, scholars have questioned the validity of a single explanation at the national level. In part due to the well-organised population registers, about 70% of the country&#x27;s Jewish population were killed in the course of World War II—a much higher percentage than in either Belgium or France, although lower than in Lithuania. Declassified records revealed that the Germans paid a bounty to Dutch police and administration officials to locate and identify Jews, aiding in their capture. Communists in and around the city of Amsterdam organised the February strike—a general strike (February 1941) to protest against the persecution of Jewish citizens.

World War II occurred in four distinct phases in the Netherlands:
* September 1939 to May 1940: After the war broke out, the Netherlands declared neutrality. The country was subsequently invaded and occupied. 
* May 1940 to June 1941: An economic boom caused by orders from Germany, combined with the &quot;velvet glove&quot; approach from Arthur Seyss-Inquart, resulted in a comparatively mild occupation. 
* June 1941 to June 1944: As the war intensified, Germany demanded higher contributions from occupied territories, resulting in a decline of living standards. Repression against the Jewish population intensified and thousands were deported to extermination camps. The &quot;velvet glove&quot; approach ended. 
* June 1944 to May 1945: Conditions deteriorated further, leading to starvation and lack of fuel. The German occupation authorities gradually lost control over the situation. Nazis wanted to make a last stand and commit acts of destruction. Others tried to mitigate the situation.

The Allies liberated most of the south of the Netherlands in the second half of 1944. The rest of the country, especially the west and north, remained under German occupation and suffered from a famine at the end of 1944, known as the &quot;Hunger Winter&quot;. On 5 May 1945, German surrender at Lüneburg Heath led to the final liberation of the whole country.

==Background==
The Dutch colonies such as the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) caused the Netherlands to be one of the top five oil producers in the world at the time and to have the world&#x27;s largest aircraft factory in the Interbellum (Fokker), which aided the neutrality of the Netherlands and the success of its arms dealings in the First World War. The country was one of the richest in Europe and could easily have afforded a large and modern military . Dutch governments between 1929 and 1943 were dominated by Christian and centre-right political parties. From 1933, the Netherlands were hit by the Great Depression, which had begun in 1929. The incumbent government of Hendrikus Colijn pursued a programme of extensive cuts to maintain the value of the guilder, which resulted in workers&#x27; riots in Amsterdam and a naval mutiny between 1933 and 1934. Eventually, in 1936, the government was forced to abandon the gold standard and to devalue the currency.

Numerous fascist movements emerged in the Netherlands during the Great Depression era, which were inspired by Italian fascism or German Nazism, but they never attracted enough members to be an effective mass movement. The National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging, NSB) supported by the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party which took power in Germany in 1933, attempted to expand in 1935. Nazi-style racial ideology had limited appeal in the Netherlands, as did its calls to violence. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the NSB was already declining in both members and voters.

During the interwar period, the government undertook a significant increase in civil infrastructure projects and land reclamation, including the Zuiderzee Works. That resulted in the final draining of seawater from the Wieringermeer polder and the completion of the Afsluitdijk.

===Neutrality===

During World War I, the Dutch government, under Pieter Cort van der Linden, had managed to preserve Dutch neutrality throughout the conflict. In the Interwar Period, the Netherlands had continued to pursue its &quot;Independence Policy&quot; even after the rise to power of the Nazi Party in Germany in 1933. The Anti-Revolutionary Party&#x27;s conservative prime minister, Hendrikus Colijn, who held power from 1933 until 1939, believed that the Netherlands could never withstand an attack by a major power. Pragmatically, the government did not spend much on the military. Although military spending was doubled between 1938 and 1939, amid rising international tensions, it constituted only 4% of national spending in 1939, in contrast to nearly 25% of Nazi Germany. The Dutch government believed it could rely on its neutrality or at least the informal support of foreign powers to defend its interests in case of war. The government began to work on plans for the defence of the country, which included the &quot;New Dutch Waterline&quot;, an area to the east of Amsterdam that would be flooded. From 1939, fortified positions were constructed, including the Grebbe and Peel-Raam Lines, to protect the key cities of Dordrecht, Utrecht, Haarlem and Amsterdam, and creating a &quot;Vesting Holland&quot; (or &quot;Fortress Holland&quot;).

In late 1939, with war already declared between the British Empire, France and Nazi Germany, the German government issued a guarantee of neutrality to the Netherlands. The government gradually mobilised the Dutch military from August 1939 that had reached its full strength by April 1940.

==German invasion==
Despite its policy of neutrality, the Netherlands were invaded on the morning of 10 May 1940, without a formal declaration of war, by German forces moving simultaneously into Belgium and Luxembourg. The attackers meant to draw Allied forces away from the Ardennes and to lure British and French forces deeper into Belgium and to pre-empt a possible British invasion in North Holland. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; needed to take over the Dutch airfields on the North Sea to launch air raids against the United Kingdom.

The armed forces of the Netherlands, with insufficient and outdated weapons and equipment, were caught largely unprepared. Much of their weaponry had not changed since the First World War. In particular, the Royal Netherlands Army did not have comparable armoured forces and could mount only a limited number of armoured cars and tankettes. The air force had only 140 aircraft, mostly outdated biplanes. Sixty-five of the Dutch aircraft were destroyed on the first day of the campaign.

The invading forces advanced rapidly but faced significant resistance. A &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; parachute assault on the first day, aimed at capturing the Dutch government in The Hague and the key airfields at Ockenburg and Ypenburg, was defeated by Dutch ground forces with heavy casualties. The Dutch succeeded in destroying significant numbers of transport aircraft that the Germans would need for their planned invasion of Britain. However, the German forces succeeded in crossing the Maas river in the Netherlands on the first day, which allowed the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; to outflank the nearby Belgian Fort Ében-Émael and force the Belgian army to withdraw from the German border.

In the eastern Netherlands, the Germans succeeded in pushing the Dutch back from the Grebbe Line, but their advance was slowed by the Dutch fortifications on the narrow Afsluitdijk Causeway that linked the north-eastern and the north-western parts of the Netherlands. The German forces advanced rapidly and, by the fourth day, were in control of most of the east of the country.

The Dutch realised that neither British nor French troops could reach the Netherlands in sufficient numbers to halt the invasion, particularly with the speed of the German advance into Belgium.

===Bombing of Rotterdam===

Fighting in Rotterdam had taken place since the first day of the campaign, when German infantrymen in seaplanes landed on the Maas River and captured several bridges intact. The Germans hesitated to risk a tank attack on the city for fear of heavy casualties. Instead, the German commander presented an ultimatum to the Dutch commander in the city. He demanded the surrender of the Dutch garrison and threatened to destroy the city by aerial bombing if it did not accept. The ultimatum was returned on a technicality since it had not been signed by the German commander. While the corrected ultimatum was being resubmitted, Luftwaffe bombers, unaware that negotiations were ongoing, struck the city.

During the Rotterdam Blitz, between 800 and 900 Dutch civilians were killed, and 25,000 homes were destroyed. The bombers&#x27; targets were the civilian areas of Rotterdam, rather than the town&#x27;s defences. Under pressure from local officials, the garrison commander surrendered the city and his 10,000 men on the evening of the 14th with the permission of Henri Winkelman, the Dutch commander-in-chief. That opened up the German advance into &quot;Fortress Holland&quot;.

===Dutch surrender===

The Dutch high command was shocked by the Rotterdam Blitz. Knowing that the army was running low on supplies and ammunition and receiving news that the city of Utrecht had been given an ultimatum similar to that of Rotterdam, Winkelman held a meeting with other Dutch generals. They decided that further resistance was futile and wanted to protect civilian residents. In the afternoon of 14 May, Winkelman issued a proclamation to his army to order them to surrender:

On 15 May, the Netherlands officially signed the surrender with Germany. Dutch forces in the province of Zeeland, which had come under French control, continued fighting alongside French forces until 17 May, when the bombardment of the town of Middelburg forced them to surrender also. The Dutch Empire, in particular the Dutch East Indies, supported the Allies; the colonies were unaffected by the surrender. Many ships of the Royal Dutch Navy in Dutch waters fled to the United Kingdom.

During the four-day campaign, about 2,300 Dutch soldiers were killed and 7,000 wounded, and more than 3,000 Dutch civilians also died. The Germans lost 2,200 men killed and 7,000 wounded. In addition, 1,300 German soldiers captured by the Dutch during the campaign, many around The Hague, had been shipped to Britain and remained POWs for the rest of the war.

Queen Wilhelmina and the Dutch government succeeded in escaping from the Netherlands before the surrender and formed a government-in-exile. Princess Juliana and her children went to Canada for safety.

==German occupation==
===Life in occupied Netherlands===

Initially, the Netherlands was placed under German military control. However, after the refusal of the Dutch government to return, the Netherlands was placed under control by a German civilian governor on 29 May 1940, unlike France or Denmark, which had their own governments, and Belgium, which was under German military control. The civil government, the &quot;Reichskommissariat Niederlande&quot;, was headed by the Austrian Nazi Arthur Seyss-Inquart.

The German occupiers implemented a policy of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (&quot;enforced conformity&quot; or &quot;coordination&quot;) and systematically eliminated non-Nazi organisations. In 1940, the German regime more or less immediately outlawed all socialist and communist parties. In 1941, it forbade all parties except for the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands.

&quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; was an enormous shock to the Dutch, who had traditionally had separate institutions for all main religious groups, particularly Catholic and Protestant, because of decades of pillarisation. The process was opposed by the Catholic Church in the Netherlands, and in 1941, all Roman Catholics were urged by Dutch bishops to leave associations that had been Nazified.

A long-term aim of the Nazis was to incorporate the Netherlands into the Greater Germanic Reich. Adolf Hitler thought very highly of the Dutch people, who were considered to be fellow members of the Aryan &quot;master race&quot;.
Initially, Seyss-Inquart applied the &#x27;velvet glove&#x27; approach; by appeasing the population he tried to win them for the National Socialist ideology. That meant that he kept repression and economic extraction as low as possible and tried to co-operate with the elite and government officials in the country. There was also a pragmatic reason since the NSB offered insufficient candidates and had no great popular support. The German market went open, and Dutch companies benefited greatly from export to Germany even if that might be seen as collaboration if goods might be used for German war efforts. In any case, despite the British victory in the Battle of Britain, many considered a German victory a realistic possibility and that it would therefore be wise to side with the winner. As a result, with the ban on other political parties, the NSB grew rapidly. Although gasoline pumps had been sealed in 1940, the occupation seemed tolerable.

After the failure of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and the subsequent German defeats at Moscow and Stalingrad in the Eastern Front of World War II, Germany increased economic extraction from its occupied territories, including the Netherlands. Economic extraction increased, and production was limited mostly to sectors relevant for the war effort. Repression increased, especially against the Jewish population.

After the Allied invasion of June 1944, the railroad strike and the frontline running through the Netherlands caused the Randstad to be cut off from food and fuel. That resulted in acute need and starvation, the &quot;Hongerwinter&quot;. The German authorities lost more and more control over the situation as the population tried to keep what little they had away from German confiscations and were less inclined to co-operate now that it was clear that Germany would lose the war. Some Nazis prepared to make a last stand against the Allied troops, followed Berlin&#x27;s Nero Decree and destroyed goods and property (destructions of the Amsterdam and Rotterdam ports, inundations), but others tried to mediate the situation.

====Luftwaffe====
The Luftwaffe was especially interested in the Netherlands, as the country was designated to become the main area for the air force bases from which to attack the United Kingdom. The Germans started construction of ten major military air bases on the day after the formal Dutch surrender, 15 May 1940. Each of them was intended to have at least 2 or 3 hard surface runways, a dedicated railway connection, major built-up and heated repair and overhaul facilities, extensive indoor and outdoor storage spaces, and most had housing and facilities for 2,000 to 3,000 men. Each air base also had an auxiliary and often a decoy airfield, complete with mock-up planes made from plywood. The largest became Deelen Air Base, north of Arnhem (twelve former German buildings at Deelen are now national monuments). Adjacent to Deelen, the large central air control bunker for Belgium and the Netherlands, Diogenes, was set up.

Within a year, the attack strategy had to be altered to a defensive operation. The ensuing air war over the Netherlands cost almost 20,000 airmen (Allied and German) their lives and 6,000 planes went down over the country, an average of three per day during the five years of the war.

The Netherlands turned into the first line of western air defence for Germany and its industrial heartland of the Ruhrgebiet, complete with extensive flak, sound detection installations and later radar. The first German night-hunter squadron started its operations from the Netherlands.

Some 30,000 Luftwaffe men and women were involved in the Netherlands throughout the war.

====Forced labour and resistance====
The &quot;Arbeitseinsatz&quot;, the drafting of civilians for forced labour, was imposed on the Netherlands. That obliged every man between 18 and 45 (530,000) to work in German factories, which were bombed regularly by the western Allies. Those who refused were forced into hiding. As food and many other goods were taken out of the Netherlands, rationing increased (with ration books). At times, the resistance would raid distribution centres to obtain ration cards to be distributed to those in hiding.

For the resistance to succeed, it was sometimes necessary for its members to feign collaboration with the Germans. After the war, that led to difficulties for those who pretended to collaborate when they could not prove they had been in the resistance, which was difficult because it was in the nature of the job to keep it a secret.

====Atlantic Wall====
The Atlantic Wall, a gigantic coastal defence line built by the Germans along the entire European coast from southwestern France to Denmark and Norway, included the coastline of the Netherlands. Some towns, such as Scheveningen, were evacuated because of that. In The Hague alone, 3,200 houses were demolished and 2,594 were dismantled. 20,000 houses were cleared, and 65,000 people were forced to move. The &quot;Arbeitseinsatz&quot; also included forcing the Dutch to work on these projects, but a form of passive resistance took place there with people working slowly or poorly.

===Holocaust===

Shortly after it was established, the military regime began to persecute the Jews of the Netherlands. In 1940, there were no deportations, and only small measures were taken against the Jews. In February 1941, the Nazis deported a small group of Dutch Jews to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. The Dutch reacted with the February strike, a nationwide protest against the deportations, unique in the history of Nazi-occupied Europe. Although the strike did not accomplish much—its leaders were executed—it was an initial setback for Seyss-Inquart. He had intended both to deport the Jews and to win the Dutch over to the Nazi cause.

Before the February strike, the Nazis had installed a Jewish Council (Dutch: &quot;Joodse Raad&quot;). This was a board of Jews, headed by Professor David Cohen and Abraham Asscher. Independent Jewish organisations, such as the Committee for Jewish Refugees—founded by Asscher and Cohen in 1933—were closed. The Jewish Council ultimately served as an instrument for organising the identification and deportation of Jews more efficiently; the Jews on the council were told and convinced they were helping the Jews.

In 1939 the Jewish population of the Netherlands was between 140,000 and 150,000, 24,000–34,000 of whom were refugees from Germany and German-controlled areas. That year, the Committee for Jewish Refugees established the Westerbork transit camp to process incoming refugees; in 1942 the German occupiers repurposed it to process outgoing Jews to labour and concentration camps. Over half of the total Jewish population—about 79,000—lived in Amsterdam; this number increased as Germans forcibly moved Dutch Jews into the city in preparation for mass deportation.

In May 1942, Jews were ordered to wear Star of David badges. The Catholic Church in the Netherlands publicly condemned the government&#x27;s action in a letter read at all Sunday parish services. The Nazi government began to treat the Dutch more harshly, and notable socialists were imprisoned. Later in the war, Catholic priests, including Titus Brandsma, were deported to concentration camps.

Concentration camps were built at Vught and Amersfoort as well. Eventually, with the assistance of Dutch police and civil service, the majority of the Dutch Jews were deported to concentration camps.

Germany was particularly effective at deporting and killing Jews in the Netherlands. By 1945, the Dutch Jewish population was about a quarter of what it had been (about 35,000). Of that number, about 8,500 escaped deportation by being in a mixed marriage to a non-Jew; about 16,500 hid or otherwise evaded detection by German authorities; and 7,000–8,000 escaped the Netherlands for the duration of the occupation.

The Dutch survival rate of 27% is much lower than in neighbouring Belgium, where 60% of Jews survived, and France, where 75% survived. Historians have offered several hypotheses for the low survival rate, including:

* The Netherlands included religion in its national records, which reduced the opportunity for Jews to mask their identity.
* Dutch authorities and the Dutch people were unusually co-operative with German authorities.
* The flat, unforested Dutch landscape deprived Jews of potential hiding places.

Marnix Croes and Peter Tammes examined the survival rates among the different regions of the Netherlands. They conclude that most of the hypotheses do not explain the data. They suggest that a more likely explanation was the varying &quot;ferocity&quot; with which the Germans and their Dutch collaborators hunted Jews in hiding in the different regions. In 2002, Ad van Liempt published &quot;Kopgeld: Nederlandse premiejagers op zoek naar joden, 1943&quot; (Bounty: Dutch bounty hunters in search of Jews, 1943), published in English as &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Bounty Hunters: The Betrayal of the Jews&quot; (2005). He found in newly-declassified records that the Germans paid a bounty to police and other collaborators, such as the Colonnie Henneicke group, for tracking down Jews.

A 2018 publication, &quot;De 102.000 namen&quot;, lists the 102,000 known victims of the persecution of Jewish, Sinti, and Roma people from the Netherlands; the book is published by Boom, Amsterdam, under the auspices of the Westerbork Remembrance Center.

===Collaboration===

Many Dutch men and women chose or were forced to collaborate with the German regime or joined the German armed forces, which usually would mean being placed in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. Others, like members of the Henneicke Column, were actively involved in capturing hiding Jews for a price and delivering them to the German occupiers. It is estimated that the Henneicke Column captured around 8,000 to 9,000 Dutch Jews who were ultimately murdered in the German death camps.

The National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands was the only legal political party in the Netherlands from 1941 and was actively involved in collaboration with the German occupiers. In 1941, when Germany still seemed certain to win the war, about three per cent of the adult male population belonged to the NSB.

After the war broke out, the NSB sympathised with the Germans but nevertheless advocated strict neutrality for the Netherlands. In May 1940, after the German invasion, 10,000 NSB members and sympathizers were put in custody by the Dutch government. Soon after the Dutch defeat, on 14 May 1940, they were set free by German troops. In June 1940, NSB leader Anton Mussert held a speech in Lunteren in which he called for the Dutch to embrace the Germans and renounce the Dutch Monarchy, which had fled to London.

In 1940, the German regime had outlawed all socialist and communist parties. In 1941, it forbade all parties except for the NSB, which openly collaborated with the occupation forces. Its membership grew to about 100,000. The newcomers (&quot;meikevers&quot;, Cockchafers or Maybugs, where &quot;May&quot; refers to the month of the German invasion) were shunned by many existing members, who accused them of opportunist behaviour. The NSB played an important role in lower government and civil service. Every new mayor appointed by the German occupation government was a member of the NSB. However, for most higher functions, the Germans preferred to leave the existing elite in place since they knew that the NSB neither offered enough suitable candidates nor enjoyed enough popular support.

After the German signing of surrender on 6 May 1945, the NSB was outlawed. Mussert was arrested the following day, and was executed on 7 May 1946. Many members of the NSB were arrested, but few were convicted.

In September 1940, the &quot;Nederlandsche SS&quot; was formed as &quot;Afdeling XI&quot; (Department XI) of the NSB. It was the equivalent to the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; in Germany. In November 1942, its name was changed to &quot;Germaansche SS in Nederland&quot;. The Nederlandsche SS was primarily a political formation but also served as manpower reservoir for the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;.

Between 22,000 and 25,000 Dutchmen volunteered to serve in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. The most notable formations were the 4th SS Volunteer &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; Brigade &quot;Nederland&quot; which saw action exclusively on the Eastern Front and the SS Volunteer Grenadier Brigade &quot;Landstorm Nederland&quot; which fought in Belgium and the Netherlands.

The &quot;Nederland&quot; brigade participated in fighting on the Eastern Front during the Battle of Narva, with several soldiers receiving the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross, Nazi Germany&#x27;s highest award for bravery.

Another form of collusion was providing goods and services essential to the German war efforts. Especially in 1940 and 1941, when a German victory was still a possibility, Dutch companies were willing to provide such goods to the greedily-purchasing Germans. Strategic supplies fell in German hands, and in May 1940 German officers placed their first orders with Dutch shipyards. The co-operation with the German industry was facilitated by the fact that due to the occupation the German market &#x27;opened&#x27; and due to facilitating behaviour from the side of the partly pro-German elite. Many directors justified their behaviour with the argument that otherwise, the Germans would have closed down their company or would have replaced them with NSB members and so they could still exercise some limited influence. After the war, no heavy sentences were dealt to high officials and company directors.

===Dutch resistance===
The Dutch resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II developed relatively slowly, but its counterintelligence, domestic sabotage, and communications networks provided key support to Allied forces beginning in 1944 and through the liberation of the country. Discovery by the Germans of involvement in the resistance meant an immediate death sentence.

The country&#x27;s terrain, lack of wilderness and dense population made it difficult to conceal any illicit activities, and it was bordered by German-controlled territory, which offered no escape route except by sea. Resistance in the Netherlands took the form of small-scale decentralised cells engaged in independent activities. The Communist Party of the Netherlands, however, organised resistance from the start of the war, as did the circle of liberal democratic resisters who were linked through Professor Dr. Willem or Wim Schermerhorn to the Dutch government-in-exile in London, the LKP (&quot;Nationale Knokploeg&quot;, or National Force Units, literal translation &quot;Brawl Crew&quot;). This was one of the largest resistance groups, numbering around 550 active participants; it was also heavily targeted by Nazi intelligence for destruction due to its links with the United Kingdom. Some small groups had absolutely no links to others. These groups produced forged ration cards and counterfeit money, collected intelligence, published underground newspapers, sabotaged phone lines and railways, prepared maps, and distributed food and goods. After 1942 the National Organisation (LO) and National Force Units (LKP) organised national coordination. Some contact was established with the government in London. After D-day the existing national organisations, the LKP, the OD and the Council of Resistance merged into the internal forces under the command of Prince Bernhard.

One of the riskiest activities was hiding and sheltering refugees and enemies of the Nazi regime, Jewish families, underground operatives, draft-age Dutch, and others. Collectively these people were known as &quot;onderduikers&quot; (&#x27;under-divers&#x27;). Later in the war, this system of people-hiding was also used to protect downed Allied airmen. Reportedly, resistance doctors in Heerlen concealed an entire hospital floor from German troops.

In February 1943, a Dutch resistance cell rang the doorbell of the former head of the Dutch general staff and now-collaborating Lieutenant general
Hendrik Seyffardt in the Hague. Seyffardt commanded the campaign to recruit Dutch volunteers for the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and the German war effort on the Eastern Front. After he answered and identified himself, he was shot twice and died the following day. The assassination of the high-level official triggered a harsh reprisal from &quot;SS&quot; General Hanns Albin Rauter, who ordered the killing of 50 Dutch hostages and a series of raids on Dutch universities. On October 1 and 2, 1944, the Dutch resistance attacked German troops near the village of Putten, which resulted in war crimes on behalf of the occupying Germans. After the attack, part of the town was destroyed, and seven people were shot in the Putten raid. The entire male population of Putten was deported and most were subjected to forced labour; 48 out of 552 survived the camps. The Dutch resistance attacked Rauter&#x27;s car on March 6, 1945, unaware of the identity of its occupant, which in turn led to the killings at Woeste Hoeve, where 116 men were rounded up and executed at the site of the ambush and another 147 Gestapo prisoners executed elsewhere.

==Dutch government and army in exile==

The Dutch army&#x27;s successful resistance in the Battle for The Hague gave the royal family an opportunity to escape. Several days before the surrender, Princess Juliana, Prince Bernhard and their daughters (Princess Beatrix and Princess Irene) travelled from The Hague to London. On 13 May, Queen Wilhelmina and key members of the Dutch government followed. The royal family were guests at Buckingham Palace, where Irene was christened on 31 May. Juliana later took Beatrix and Irene to Canada, where they remained for the duration of the war.

Shortly after the German victory, the Dutch government, led by Prime Minister Dirk Jan de Geer, was invited by the Germans to return to the country and to form a pro-German puppet government, as the Vichy government had agreed to do in France. De Geer wanted to accept that invitation, but the Queen refused it and dismissed him in favour of Pieter Gerbrandy.

==Dutch East Indies and war in the Far East==
On 8 December 1941, the Netherlands declared war on the Japanese Empire. On 10 January 1942, the Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).

Dutch naval ships joined forces with the Allies to form the American-British-Dutch-Australian (ABDA) Fleet, commanded by Dutch Rear Admiral Karel Doorman. On February 27–28, 1942, Doorman was ordered to take the offensive against the Imperial Japanese Navy. His objections on the matter were overruled. The ABDA fleet finally encountered the Japanese surface fleet at the Battle of the Java Sea at which Doorman gave the order to engage. During the ensuing battle, the Allied fleet suffered heavy losses. The Dutch cruisers &quot;Java&quot; and &quot;De Ruyter&quot; were lost, together with the destroyer &quot;Kortenaer&quot;. The other Allied cruisers, the Australian &quot;Perth&quot;, the British &quot;Exeter&quot;, and the American &quot;Houston&quot;, tried to disengage but were spotted by the Japanese in the following days and were eventually all destroyed. Many ABDA destroyers were also lost.

After Japanese troops had landed on Java, and the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army had been unsuccessful in stopping their advance because the Japanese could not occupy a relatively-unguarded airstrip [clarfiy], the Dutch forces on Java surrendered on 7 March 1942. Some 42,000 Dutch soldiers were taken prisoner and interned in labour camps, but some were executed on the spot. Later, all Dutch civilians (some 100,000 in total), were arrested and interned in camps, and some were deported to Japan or sent to work on the Thai-Burma Railway. During the Japanese occupation, between 4 and 10 million Javanese were forced to work for the Japanese war effort. Some 270,000 Javanese were taken to other parts of Southeast Asia; only 52,000 of those survived.

A Dutch government study described how the Japanese military forcibly recruited women as prostitutes in the Dutch East Indies and concluded that among the 200 to 300 European women working in Japanese military brothels, &quot;some sixty five were most certainly forced into prostitution&quot;. Others, faced with starvation in the refugee camps, agreed to offers of food and payment for work, the nature of which was not completely revealed to them.
The Dutch submarines escaped and resumed the war effort from bases in Australia such as Fremantle. As a part of the Allied forces, they were on the hunt for Japanese tankers on their way to Japan and the movement of Japanese troops and weapons to other sites of battle, including New Guinea. Because of the significant number of Dutch submarines active in the Pacific Theatre of the war, the Dutch were named the &quot;Fourth Ally&quot; in the theatre, along with the Australians, the Americans, and the New Zealanders.

Many Dutch Army and Navy airmen escaped and, with aeroplanes provided by the Americans, formed the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s Nos. 18 and 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadrons, equipped with B-25 Mitchell bombers and P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, respectively. No. 18 Squadron conducted bombing raids from Australia to the Dutch East Indies. Both squadrons eventually also participated in their recapture.

Gradually, control of the Netherlands East Indies was wrested away from the Japanese. The largest Allied invasion of the Pacific Theatre took place in July 1945 with Australian landings on the island of Borneo to seize the strategic oil-fields from the Japanese forces, which were now cut off. At the time, the Japanese had already begun independence negotiations with Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno, and Indonesian forces had taken control of sizeable portions of Sumatra and Java. After the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, Indonesian nationalists, led by Sukarno declared Indonesian independence, and a four-year armed and diplomatic struggle between the Netherlands and the Indonesian nationalists began.

Dutch civilians, who suffered greatly during their internment, finally returned home to a land that had greatly suffered as well.

==Final year==
After the Allied landing in Normandy in June 1944, the Western Allies rapidly advanced in the direction of the Dutch border. Tuesday, 5 September, is known as &quot;Dolle dinsdag&quot; (&quot;Mad Tuesday&quot;) since the Dutch began celebrating and believed that they were close to liberation. In September, the Allies launched Operation Market Garden, a failed attempt to advance from the Dutch-Belgian border across the rivers Meuse, Waal and Rhine into the north of the Netherlands and Germany. However, the Allied forces did not reach the objective because they could not capture the Rhine bridge at the Battle of Arnhem. During Market Garden, substantial regions to the south were liberated, including Nijmegen and Eindhoven. A subsequent German counterattack against the Nijmegen salient (the Island) was defeated in early October.

Parts of the southern Netherlands were not liberated by Operation Market Garden, which had established a narrow salient between Eindhoven and Nijmegen. In the east of North Brabant and in Limburg, British and American forces during Operation Aintree managed to defeat the remaining German forces west of the Meuse between late September and early December 1944 by destroying the German bridgehead between the Meuse and the Peel marshes. During the offensive, the only tank battle ever fought on Dutch soil took place at Overloon.

At the same time, the Allies also advanced into the province of Zeeland. At the start of October 1944, the Germans still occupied Walcheren and dominated the Scheldt estuary and its approaches to the port of Antwerp. The crushing need for a large supply port forced the Battle of the Scheldt in which First Canadian Army fought on both sides of the estuary during the month to clear the waterways. Large battles were fought to clear the Breskens Pocket, Woensdrecht and the Zuid-Beveland Peninsula of German forces, primarily &quot;stomach&quot; units of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; as well as German paratroopers of Battle Group Chill. German units composed of convalescents and the medically unfit were named for their ailment; thus, &quot;stomach&quot; units for soldiers with ulcers.

By 31 October, resistance south of the Scheldt had collapsed, and the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, British 52nd (Lowland) Division and 4th Special Service Brigade all made attacks on Walcheren Island. Strong German defences made a landing very difficult, and the Allies responded by bombing the dikes of Walcheren at Westkapelle, Vlissingen and Veere to flood the island. Though the Allies had warned residents with pamphlets, 180 inhabitants of Westkappelle died. The coastal guns on Walcheren were silenced in the opening days of November and the Scheldt battle declared over. No German forces remained intact along the path to Antwerp.

After the offensive on the Scheldt, Operation Pheasant was launched in conjunction to liberate North Brabant. The offensive after some resistance liberated most of region; the cities of Tilburg, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Willemstad and Roosendaal were liberated by British forces. Bergen Op Zoom was taken by the Canadians and the Polish 1st Armoured Division led by General Maczek liberated the city of Breda without any civilian casualties on 29 October 1944. The operation as a whole also broke the German positions that had defended the region along its canals and rivers.

The Dutch government had not wanted to use the old water line when the Germans had invaded in 1940. It was still possible to create an island out of the Holland region by destroying dikes and flooding the polders, which contained the main cities. The Dutch government had decided that too many people would die to justify the flooding. However, Hitler ordered for Fortress Holland (German: &quot;Festung Holland&quot;) to be held at any price. Much of the northern Netherlands remained in German hands until the Rhine crossings in late March 1945.

===Hunger Winter===
The winter of 1944–1945 was very harsh, which led to &quot;hunger journeys&quot; and many cases of starvation (about 30,000 casualties), exhaustion, cold and disease. The winter is known as the &quot;Hongerwinter&quot; (literally, &quot;hunger winter&quot;) or the Dutch famine of 1944. In response to a general railway strike ordered by the Dutch government-in-exile in expectation of a general German collapse near the end of 1944, the Germans cut off all food and fuel shipments to the western provinces in which 4.5 million people lived. Severe malnutrition was common and 18,000 people starved to death. Relief came at the beginning of May 1945.

=== Bombing of the Bezuidenhout ===

On 3 March 1945, the British Royal Air Force mistakenly bombed the densely populated Bezuidenhout neighbourhood in the Dutch city of The Hague. The British bomber crews had intended to bomb the Haagse Bos (&quot;Forest of the Hague&quot;) district where the Germans had installed V-2 launching facilities that had been used to attack English cities. However, the pilots were issued with the wrong coordinates, so the navigational instruments of the bombers had been set incorrectly. Combined with fog and clouds which obscured their vision, the bombs were instead dropped on the Bezuidenhout residential neighbourhood. At the time, the neighbourhood was more densely populated than usual with evacuees from The Hague and Wassenaar; 511 residents were killed and approximately 30,000 were left homeless.

===Liberation===

After crossing the Rhine at Wesel and Rees, Canadian, British and Polish forces entered the Netherlands from the east and liberated the eastern and the northern provinces. Notable battles during the movement are the Battle of Groningen and the Battle of Otterlo, both in April 1945.

The western provinces were not liberated until the surrender of German forces in the Netherlands was negotiated on the eve of 5 May 1945 (three days before the general capitulation of Germany), in the Hotel de Wereld in Wageningen. Previously the Swedish Red Cross had been allowed to provide relief efforts, and Allied forces were allowed to airdrop food over the German-occupied territories in Operation Manna.

During Operation Amherst, Allied troops advanced to the North Netherlands. To support the advance of the II Canadian Corps, French paratroopers were dropped in Friesland and Drenthe who were the first Allied troops to reach Friesland. The French successfully captured the crucial Stokersverlaat Bridge. The region was successfully liberated shortly after.

On the island of Texel, nearly 800 men of the Georgian Legion, serving in the German army as Osttruppen, rebelled on 5 April 1945. Their rebellion was crushed by the German army after two weeks of battle. 565 Georgians, 120 inhabitants of Texel, and 800 Germans died. The 228 surviving Georgians were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union when the war ended.

After being liberated, Dutch citizens began taking the law into their own hands, like in other liberated countries, such as France. Collaborators and Dutch women who had relationships with men of the German occupying force, called &quot;Moffenmeiden&quot; were abused and humiliated in public, usually by having their heads shaved and painted orange.

===Casualties===
By the end of the war, 205,901 Dutch men, women and children had died of war-related causes. The Netherlands had the highest per capita death rate of all Nazi-occupied countries in Western Europe (2.36%). Over half (107,000) were Holocaust victims. There were also many thousands of non-Dutch Jews in the total, who had fled to the Netherlands from other countries, seeking safety, the most famous being Anne Frank. Another 30,000 died in the Dutch East Indies, either while fighting the Japanese or in camps as Japanese POWs. Dutch civilians were also held in these camps.

==Postwar==
After the war, some accused of collaborating with the Germans were lynched or otherwise punished without trial. Men who had fought with the Germans in the &quot; or &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; were used to clear minefields and suffered losses accordingly. Others were sentenced by courts for treason. Some were proven to have been wrongly arrested and were cleared of charges, sometimes after they had been held in custody for a long period of time.

The Dutch government initially developed plans to annex part of Germany (the Bakker-Schut Plan), which would substantially increase the country&#x27;s land area. The German population would be expelled or &quot;Dutchified&quot;. The plan was dropped after an Allied refusal. Two small villages were added to the Netherlands in 1949 and returned in 1963. One successfully-implemented plan was Operation Black Tulip, the deportation of all holders of German passports from the Netherlands, numbering several thousand.

The bank balances of Dutch Jews who were killed were still the subject of legal proceedings more than 70 years after the end of the war.

The end of the war also meant the final loss of the Dutch East Indies. After the surrender of the Japanese in the Dutch East Indies, Indonesian nationalists fought a four-year war of independence against Dutch and at first British Commonwealth forces, which eventually led to the Dutch recognition of the independence of Indonesia under pressure of the United States. Many Dutch and Indonesians then emigrated or returned to the Netherlands.

World War II left many lasting effects on Dutch society. On 4 May, the Dutch commemorate those who died during the war, and all wars since. Among the living, there are many who still bear the emotional scars of the war from both the first and the second generation. In 2000, the government was still granting 24,000 people an annual compensatory payment although that also includes victims from later wars, such as the Korean War.

In 2017, the Dutch Red Cross offered its “deep apologies” for its failure to act to protect Jews, Sinti, Roma, and political prisoners during the war after the publication of a study that it had commissioned from the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies.

<text>Party in the Park is the generic name given to music concerts organised by various radio stations and local authorities and groups in the United Kingdom, typically in large parks during the summer, however it is also used to refer to a family oriented event where people can literally have a Party in the Park.

== Party in the Park Nanaimo ==
Party in the Park Nanaimo is in the third iteration. 2018&#x27;s event is headlining Madeline Merlo, JJ Shiplett and Andrew Hyatt. The inaugural Party In The Park headlined Monster Truck, One Bad Son and Girls Guns and Glory. Party In The Park Nanaimo 2017 headlined Aaron Pirchett, Lion Bear Fox and EagleEyes. The annual outdoor music festival that occurs in Nanaimo, British Columbia every June is held on the Beban Sports Fields.

==Leeds&#x27; Party in the Park==

Party in the Park, Leeds was an annual free event, held in Leeds on the grounds of Temple Newsam by Leeds City Council and 96.3 Radio Aire. It took place each year the day after Opera in the Park at the same location and attracted around 70,000 people.

The event started in 1994 and was headlined by Bad Boys Inc and included performances by E.Y.C.

In 2011, tickets for Party in the park were prioritised for people with a Leeds postcode since it was an event held by Leeds City Council and also had overwhelming demand for tickets from all over West Yorkshire.

It was decided in 2013 by Leeds City Council that the tickets would no longer be free due to budget restrictions. Instead, they would be priced at up to £10 each.

Finally in 2014, Leeds City Council and 96.3 Radio Aire announced that Party in the Park would be cancelled due to a lack of funds. The concert has not returned since.

Previous artists to perform:
Atomic Kitten, Westlife, Busted, McFly, Forbidden JUiCE, Olly Murs, The Wanted, Kelly Rowland, Peter Andre, JLS, Ricky Martin, E.Y.C., MN8, Deuce, 911, B*Witched, Fast Food Rockers, Louise Redknapp, Bad Boys Inc, Let Loose, Ultimate Kaos, Kavana, 5ive, Scouting for Girls, The Saturdays, Jason Donovan, Craig David, Damage, Pixie Lott, Girls Aloud, The Baseballs, Chicane, Ross Copperman, Alesha Dixon, Cher Lloyd, Jay Sean, Shayne Ward, Alexandra Burke, Alyssa Reid, Arctic Monkeys, Conor Maynard, Cover Drive, DJ Fresh, Labrinth, Little Mix, Marcus Collins, One Direction, Professor Green, Stooshe, Tulisa Contostavlos, Wretch 32, Inna.

<text>The Maison de la Mutualité (; often shortened to la Mutualité) is a conference center at 24 Rue Saint-Victor, 5th arrondissement of Paris, France. The closest métro station is Maubert-Mutualité.

It is the headquarters of the federation of nonprofit mutual insurers of the Île-de-France &quot;région&quot;, which rents its halls and rooms to outside users. The conference center has an attached restaurant.

&quot;La Mutualité&quot; hosts a variety of events, from the yearly meeting of the shareholders of small companies to important meetings of national political parties. Because of the latter, it often appears in the news.

The theatre of the Maison de la Mutualité was used as a classical recordings venue, particularly for many records by the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra after the Second World War, but also in more recent years, for instance by Deutsche Grammophon for Messiaen&#x27;s Quatuor pour la fin du temps and by Philips for &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; conducted Semyon Bychkov.

French anarchist singer-songwriters Léo Ferré (see live album &quot;Léo Ferré Mai 68&quot;) and Renaud sang here. Congolese band Zaïko Langa Langa headlined many concerts in the hall between 1989 and 1991.

In 1950 the Association Internationale de la Mutualité was established during a conference in the Maison de la Mutualité.

<text>Thomas J. Moore (May 1, 1883 – February 12, 1955) was an Irish-American actor and director. He appeared in at least 186 motion pictures from 1908 to 1954. Frequently cast as the romantic lead, he starred in silent movies as well as in some of the first talkies.

Born in Fordstown Crossroads in May 1883 , County Meath, Moore, along with his brothers, Owen, Matt, and Joe, and their sister Mary (1890–1919), he emigrated to the United States as a steerage passenger on board the S.S. &quot;Anchoria&quot; and was inspected on Ellis Island in May 1896 . Owen and Matt also had successful movie careers. Tom Moore appeared in his first silent motion picture in 1908. He also directed 17 motion pictures in 1914 and 1915, including &quot;The Secret Room&quot; (1915).

==Personal life==

In 1914, he married silent star Alice Joyce, with whom he had a daughter, Alice Moore (1916–1960), who acted in six films with her father from 1934 to 1937. While in New York City on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1920, Moore met the young French actress Renée Adorée. A whirlwind romance ensued and six weeks after their meeting, on February 12, 1921, they were married at his home in Beverly Hills. The marriage lasted only a few years. In 1931, Moore was married a third time, to actress Eleanor Merry. His brother, Owen Moore, was also an actor, and was married to Mary Pickford.

The Great Depression saw many studios close and much consolidation as the motion picture industry went through tough times. Moore retired from the screen in the mid-1930s. Ten years later, he returned to act in minor supporting roles.

Tom Moore died of cancer at age 71 in Santa Monica, California. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1640 Vine Street.

It is now bypassed by the A55 road, but continues to be a hub of activity due to the presence of Glan Clwyd Hospital. It has a town council with a mayor.

==History==
The name &quot;Bodelwyddan&quot; translates as Abode (Bod) of Elwyddan, he being a fifth-century Romano-British Chieftain of the area.

While Bodelwyddan may not have a long and notable history, it does contain many historic buildings, and has been the site of several important military training exercises during the two World Wars.

Until 1860, Bodelwyddan was a part of the parish of St Asaph, before being gazetted as a new and separate parish on 3 August, following the construction of the Marble Church.

During the two World Wars, the nearby Kinmel Camp was used to house soldiers, and was the location of the Kinmel Park Riots in 1919, which led to several Canadian deaths.

Historically, Bodelwyddan was home to a lead mine, but plans to abandon the mine were submitted in 1857 and the mine closed shortly thereafter. The nearby &quot;Engine Hill&quot; was named after the mine engines designed to keep the mine&#x27;s water problems under control. Engine Hill has four &quot;main&quot; engine shafts with multiple smaller shafts; however, the majority of knowledge on earlier working has been lost.

The A55 road Bodelwyddan bypass was completed in 1986, and has been fundamental in shaping the changing Bodelwyddan, being at least partially responsible for the Local Development Plan and the continued existence of Ysbyty Glan Clwyd.

===Local Development Plan===

In 2010, it was made public that Denbighshire County Council&#x27;s Local Development Plan (LDP) had allocated over 1,700 new houses to be built in Bodelwyddan.

Following the announcement, the proposal has been heavily opposed by locals
including Conwy County Borough Council, who said “No evidence has been presented by Denbighshire County Council providing details of the likely impact on services generally in Conwy County (especially Health and Education)&quot;

According to forecasts, the population of Bodelwyddan would be expected to rise significantly until 2021, potentially tripling the population.

In 2011 a referendum was held by the Town Council on the topic, with a resounding 94% against result. Despite the clear and near-unanimous opposition, the decision was made to go ahead with the plan, following a split vote by Denbighshire County Council.

==Geography==
Despite Bodelwyddan&#x27;s small size, it is a town and not a village, as evidenced by its Town Council.

To its South lies Bodelwyddan Castle, which sits on Engine Hill - so named for the Steam Engines that drove the mining operations that took place there in the past.

In the area surrounding Bodelwyddan lie small farms, including two farm shops. Also nearby are several hamlets - including: Cefn Meiriadog, Marli, Llannefydd and Pengwern.

==Demographics==
At the time of the 2001 census, the Usual Resident Population numbered 1,802, of which 915 (50.8%) were male and 887 (49.2%) were female.

With a density of just 20.95 people per hectare, Bodelwyddan is one of the most sparsely populated towns or villages in North Wales that is not classified as a hamlet.

==Notable landmarks==
Bodelwyddan has over sixty listed buildings within its boundary. Bodelwyddan Castle and the Faenol Fawr are two of the oldest buildings.

Notable buildings include the Marble Church, built by John Gibson in the 1850s; Bodelwyddan Castle, now used as a branch of the National Portrait Gallery; and Glan Clwyd Hospital, the major hospital for central North Wales.

===Bodelwyddan Castle===

Bodelwyddan Castle, built around 1460 as a manor house is one of the most obvious buildings on the Bodelwyddan skyline, both at day and at night. Being of a more recent vintage than most other nearby castles, Bodelwyddan Castle is well preserved. Today, Bodelwyddan castle is used primarily as a hotel and art gallery, but in the past has served other functions, such as being a private school for girls between 1920 and 1982.
===Faenol Fawr===

 Faenol Fawr was built in 1597 as a country house for John Lloyd, registrar for the St Asaph diocese. Dormer windows with stepped gables were installed as part of an 18th-century renovation. It is now a country house hotel. It is a grade II* listed building.

===Glan Clwyd Hospital===

Glan Clwyd Hospital () is one of the largest hospitals in North Wales, and is the major hospital for Central North Wales. Until 2007, it served as the headquarters of the Conwy &amp; Denbighshire NHS Trust, prior to the mergers that took place to form the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board.

Serving a population of approximately 195,000, with over 675 beds, it brings much traffic through Bodelwyddan and benefits from Bodelwyddan&#x27;s good traffic links and proximity to the A55 Road.

===Kinmel Camp===
Kinmel Camp is an army training base, that dates from 1915, during the First World War. The Kinmel Camp Railway served the camp up until 1964, and the camp is home to several First World War practice trenches, dug by recruits; now legally protected poignant examples of pristine trenches from that era.

In the 1919 Kinmel Park Riots, five Canadian soldiers perished; There have been other tragic events in Kinmel Park history, including the death of many soldiers in the 1918 flu pandemic.
===Marble Church===
St Margaret&#x27;s Church, better known as &#x27;The Marble Church&#x27;, is clearly visible from a great distance up and down the A55 road and was erected between 1856 and 1860, and was built with local Limestone, sourced from nearby Llanddulas, whose appearance closely resembles porcelain.

The Church is dedicated to two Saints, Margaret and Kentigern, and contains several notable graves - including the grave of Elizabeth James, mother of Sir Henry Morton Stanley, a renowned Victorian Explorer. It is also home to the graves of over eighty Canadian soldiers, dating to 1918 and 1919.

==Education==

The local primary school is Ysgol y Faenol, which primarily feeds into Ysgol Glan Clwyd in St Asaph and Ysgol Emrys Ap Iwan in Abergele.
