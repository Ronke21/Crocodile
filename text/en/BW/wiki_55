<text>Death from laughter is an extremely rare form of death, usually resulting from either cardiac arrest or asphyxiation, that has itself been caused by a fit of laughter. Though uncommon, death by laughter has been recorded from the times of ancient Greece to modern times.

Usually, the phrase &quot;dying from laughter&quot; is used as a hyperbole.

== Pathophysiology ==
Laughter is normally harmless. Typically, laughter is controlled by two systems in the brain: an involuntary system that involves the amygdala and a voluntary system that involves the premotor opercular areas. However, death may result from several pathologies that deviate from benign laughter. Infarction of the pons and the medulla oblongata in the brain may cause the pseudobulbar affect. Asphyxiation caused by laughter leads the body to shut down from the lack of oxygen.

Laughter can cause atonia and collapse (&quot;agelastic syncope&quot;), which in turn can cause trauma. See also laughter-induced syncope, cataplexy, and Bezold–Jarisch reflex. Gelastic seizures can be due to focal lesions to the hypothalamus. Depending upon the size of the lesion, the emotional lability may be a sign of an acute condition, and not itself the cause of the fatality. Gelastic syncope has also been associated with the cerebellum.

== Notable cases ==
* Zeuxis, a 5th-century BC Greek painter, is said to have died laughing at the humorous way in which he painted an old woman.
* Chrysippus, also known as &quot;the man who died from laughing at his joke&quot;, an influential 3rd-century BC Greek Stoic philosopher, reportedly died of laughter after he saw a donkey eating his fermented figs; he told a slave to give the donkey undiluted wine to wash them down, and then, &quot;having laughed too much, he died&quot; (Diogenes Laërtius 7.185).
* In 1410, King Martin of Aragon is said to have died from a combination of indigestion and uncontrollable laughter.
* In 1556, Pietro Aretino &quot;is said to have died of suffocation from laughing too much&quot;.
* In 1660, Thomas Urquhart, the Scottish aristocrat, polymath, and first translator of François Rabelais&#x27; writings into English, is said to have died laughing upon hearing that Charles II had taken the throne.
* On October 14, 1920, 56-year-old Arthur Cobcroft, a dog trainer from Loftus Street, Leichhardt, Australia, was reading a five-year-old newspaper and was amused at the prices for some commodities in 1915 as compared to 1920. He made a remark to his wife regarding this and burst into laughter, and in the midst of it, he collapsed and died. A doctor surnamed Nixon was called in, and stated that the death was due to heart failure, brought by excessive laughter.
* During the night of October 30, 1965 in Manila, Philippines, a 24-year-old carpenter who was well-known for making his companions laugh was telling jokes to his friends. The joke, which the carpenter&#x27;s friends told police, was so funny that it caused the carpenter to fall in an uncontrollable fit of laughter from which he then fainted; he was brought to the hospital, but died before he could be given medical help. The book &quot;The Big Book of Boy Stuff&quot; by author Bart King recounts the incident in anecdotal form, where the carpenter was instead told the joke by his friends rather than himself, and &quot;laughed until he cried, collapsed, and then died.&quot;
* On March 24, 1975, Alex Mitchell, from King&#x27;s Lynn, England, died laughing while watching the &quot;Kung Fu Kapers&quot; episode of &quot;The Goodies&quot;, featuring a kilt-clad Scotsman with his bagpipes battling a master of the Lancastrian martial art &quot;Eckythump&quot;, who was armed with a black pudding. After 25 minutes of continuous laughter, Mitchell then slumped on the sofa and died from heart failure. His widow later sent &quot;The Goodies&quot; a letter thanking them for making Mitchell&#x27;s final moments of life so pleasant. Diagnosis of his granddaughter in 2012 of having the inheritable long QT syndrome (a heart rhythm abnormality) suggests that Mitchell may have died of a cardiac arrest caused by the same condition.
* In 1989, during the initial run of the film &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;, a 71-year-old Danish audiologist named Ole Bentzen reportedly laughed himself to death.
* In 2003, an ice-cream truck driver in Northern Thailand, died soon after he began laughing in his sleep. One late Tuesday night, Damnoen Saen-um, 52, was asleep in his home in Mueang Phuket district when he started mumbling and laughing. Newspapers reported that Damnoen&#x27;s wife made several attempts to wake up her husband as he was laughing. To no avail, Damnoen stopped breathing on Wednesday, after about two minutes of laughing. A doctor in the province calls this an unusual case and suspects Damnoen may have died from heart complications. However, they are unsure as he had no prior history of heart problems and was reported to have been walking normally the day before.

==In fiction==
* &quot;The Three Infernal Jokes&quot;, short story in &quot;The Last Book of Wonder&quot; (1916) by Lord Dunsany, about three jokes &quot;which shall make all who hear them simply die of laughter&quot;.
* &quot;The Funniest Joke in the World&quot;, episode of British sketch comedy &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, which revolves around a joke so funny that anybody who hears it promptly laughs themselves to death.
* &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;; the weasels of the Toon Patrol literally die laughing. Judge Doom mentions earlier in the film that this happened to their hyena cousins.
* &quot;The Stand In&quot;, episode of American comedy &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, which features Jerry Seinfeld telling a joke to a hospital patient who then suddenly dies from laughter.
* &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; (1996), a novel by David Foster Wallace in which the meta-narrative includes a film so entertaining that those who see it lose all interest in anything else, and die.
*&quot;The Clean House&quot;, a play where dying of laughter is a reoccurring theme.
*South Park, Kenny McCormick dies from laughing in season 5, episode 4
*On the television series &quot;1000 Ways to Die&quot;, a semi-fictionalized case, based on some of these actual deaths, was dramatized as &quot;way to die&quot; number 302, &quot;Funny Boned&quot;, in the season 1 finale &quot;I See Dead People (and They&#x27;re Cracking Me Up)&quot;; the fictional incident, claimed to take place on January 18/19, 1997, follows a pub patron named Chuck, who enjoys telling and hearing jokes, hearing one particular one so funny he simply could not stop laughing after hearing it, even after leaving the pub and returning the following day; by this time, he had been laughing for over 36 straight hours, and it proved such a strain on his heart that he dropped dead in the pub of a heart attack.

<text>The second Negro National League (NNL II) was one of the several Negro leagues that were established during the period in the United States when organized baseball was segregated. The league was founded in 1933 by businessman Gus Greenlee of Pittsburgh.

== League history ==

The second Negro National League was established in 1933 by Gus Greenlee, an African-American businessman of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, two years after the first Negro National League had disbanded, after the start of the Great Depression. The second Negro National League lasted until 1948, the year after Major League Baseball integrated. After that, its surviving teams merged into the Negro American League.

To distinguish between the two Negro National Leagues, they are usually referred to as the first Negro National League (NNL I) and the second Negro National League (NNL II).

== League champions ==

=== Pennant winners ===

From 1937 and 1938, 1940, and 1942 through 1946, the team in first place at the end of the season was declared the pennant winner (league champion). Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule (and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many more games than others did in any given season. In 1933, Cole&#x27;s Chicago American Giants claimed the first half title, but the Pittsburgh Crawfords won the second half and had an overall better record. The following year saw the Stars have a better winning percentage that saw them compete against the third place Chicago team despite the fact Pittsburgh played (and won) more games. This led to some disputed championships and two teams claiming the title. Generally, the team with the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) was awarded the pennant, but other times it was the team with the most victories. The &quot;games behind&quot; method of recording standings was uncommon in most black leagues.

=== League play-offs ===
On five occasions, the League held a postseason series to determine the pennant champion.

1933 would have been the first to match the first and second half champions, but the Pittsburgh Crawfords were instead awarded the pennant over the first half champion Chicago American Giants. 1936 had an array of games that may or may not have been formal postseason games. For example, the Washington Elite Giants won the first half after beating the Philadelphia Stars 7–5 in a one-game match on September 17. Pittsburgh (who had a better record overall) faced the Newark Eagles from September 12–15 and won 3–1–1 in either a second-half playoff or a regular series-turned-playoff. Washington and Pittsburgh played three games from September 21–27, but no box scores exist for the games (which Pittsburgh won two of three) in a series that was evidently abandoned. 

In one year (1939), the top four teams (Homestead Grays, Newark Eagles, Baltimore Elite Giants, Philadelphia Stars) were matched together in a best-of-five tournament. The Grays beat the Stars in five games while the Elite Giants beat the Eagles in four games to set up the Championship Series. The New York Cubans won the second half of the 1947 season but advanced to the Negro World Series over the Newark Eagles (first half champions). 1948 ended prematurely after a controversial finish to a disputed tie game in the third game.

=== Negro World Series ===
For the duration of the league, a Negro World Series took place seven times, from 1942 through 1948. The Negro National League&#x27;s pennant winner met the champion of the rival Negro American League. Five out of the seven years, the Negro National League team (below in bold) prevailed.

*1942 – Kansas City Monarchs beat Washington Homestead Grays, 4 games to 0 games
*1943 – Washington Homestead Grays beat Birmingham Black Barons, 4 games to 3 games
*1944 – Washington Homestead Grays beat Birmingham Black Barons, 4 games to 1 game
*1945 – Cleveland Buckeyes beat Washington Homestead Grays, 4 games to 0 games
*1946 – Newark Eagles beat Kansas City Monarchs, 4 games to 3 games
*1947 – New York Cubans beat Cleveland Buckeyes, 4 games to 1 game
*1948 – Washington Homestead Grays beat Birmingham Black Barons, 4 games to 1 game

<doc id="647438" wikidata="Q252662" url="?curid=647438" title="Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">
<text>The Shredder is a supervillain and the main antagonist of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; media franchise created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. The character debuted in the Mirage Studios comic book &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; #1 (May 1984), and has since endured as the archenemy of the turtles and their master Splinter.

The Shredder is usually depicted as the alter ego of Oroku Saki, the ruthless leader of a criminal ninja organization known as the Foot Clan. A suit of armor equipped with metal blades and tekko-kagi, loosely based on that of a samurai, serves as the Shredder&#x27;s visual motif.

In 2009, IGN ranked Shredder as the 39th-greatest comic-book villain of all time. The character has been featured in almost every media adaptation of the &quot;TMNT&quot; franchise, having been portrayed in live-action films by James Saito, François Chau, Tohoru Masamune, and Brian Tee. James Avery, Scottie Ray, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Hoon Lee are among the actors who have voiced the character in animated films and television shows. 
==Concept and creation==
Kevin Eastman got the idea for the Shredder&#x27;s armor from large trapezoidal cheese graters which he envisioned on a villainous character&#x27;s arms. He then said, &quot;Could you imagine a character with weapons on his arms like this?&quot; Peter Laird suggested the name The Shredder. Although Shredder is often depicted as the main antagonist in most &quot;TMNT&quot; adaptations, it was never the creators&#x27; intention to be the case in his original inception in the Mirage Comics:

==Comic books==
===Mirage and Image===
====Oroku Saki====

In the original comic books from Mirage Comics, Oroku Saki had an elder brother by the name of Oroku Nagi, who had been killed by fellow ninja Hamato Yoshi (the owner of Splinter, the Turtles&#x27; mentor) in a feud over a woman named Tang Shen, resulting in Yoshi fleeing with Shen to the United States.

Angered by the death of his elder brother, Saki joined the Foot Clan and trained to be a ninja. He quickly became one of their deadliest warriors and rose up the ranks and was chosen to lead the Foot&#x27;s American branch. Operating in New York under the name of The Shredder, Saki used the opportunity to avenge his brother by killing Yoshi and Shen. Under Saki&#x27;s leadership, the Foot participated in variety of criminal activities, including drug smuggling, arms running, and assassination.

Fifteen years later, Shredder was challenged by the Ninja Turtles, who were the result of an accident exposing four ordinary turtles to radioactive waste. They were trained by Yoshi&#x27;s pet rat Splinter, who had also been mutated by the same substance, to avenge his former master. After a lengthy rooftop battle where Shredder seemed to be winning, Leonardo managed to plunge his sword through Shredder&#x27;s torso. Defeated, he was offered the opportunity to commit seppuku (ritual suicide), but refused and detonated a thermite grenade, in an attempt to take their lives alongside his own. But at the last second, Donatello used his bo to knock Shredder off the building to his death.

However, it was not yet the end of the Shredder. He returned on Christmas Eve seemingly resurrected with an army of Foot Ninjas severely beating Leonardo and burning down the apartment of the turtles&#x27; ally April O&#x27;Neil, forcing them to go into hiding outside the city.

A year later, in the story &quot;Return to New York&quot;, the Turtles returned to settle the score with Shredder. Leonardo faced off against Oroku Saki alone, during which Shredder revealed he was brought back to life by a technique using worms feeding on his remains and recreating his cells to reform his body. The same technique was also used to create the Shredder Clones. In the battle, Leonardo decapitates the villain, finally killing him, and the four turtles burn his body at the Hudson River.

====&quot;Tales of the TMNT&quot;====
In the second volume of the anthology series &quot;Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; story &quot;Worms of Madness&quot; it is shown that a few weeks after the events of their final battle, the Shredder had yet another resurrection of sorts when a Foot Mystic reactivated the worms. However, the Foot Mystic did not resurrect Saki himself but the worm colony which had gained sentience and retained Saki&#x27;s memories and believing itself to be Saki. The worms then went out to find a new body and chose that of a shark. After the Foot kidnapped Splinter, the turtles managed to engage the &quot;Shredder-Shark&quot; in battle, defeating it by severing its connection to the mystic at which point the creature realized that it was not the real Saki.

The &quot;Shredder-Shark&quot; returned once more kidnapping Casey Jones&#x27;s adopted daughter Shadow to lure the Turtles into a trap. With the Turtles away, it was up to Casey and Splinter to defeat it and rescue Shadow, finally killing the creature.

====Other versions of the Shredder====
Throughout a considerable part of the Image comic series, Raphael tries to impersonate Shredder by wearing his armor. Following this, he is accepted as the leader of the Foot Clan. In later issues of the series, a mysterious Lady Shredder appears to challenge Raphael. Although the book was canceled before her identity could be revealed, writer Gary Carlson confirmed after the fact that she was meant to be Karai. The female ninja Pimiko from series claims to be Shredder&#x27;s daughter.

In Volume Four series, Leonardo encounters Oroku Yoshi, a Battle Nexus contestant wearing armor almost identical to that of the second animated series&#x27; Shredder. His connection to Oroku Saki and the Foot is not known, since the bi-monthly comic was ultimately cancelled in 2010. In issue 32 he was called to meet a mysterious individual who asks to bring Leo with him as well.

===Archie Comics===
The Archie Comics series uses the same background as the 1987 cartoon, as the first issues are identical. Later in the Archie comics version, Shredder travels to the future and works with Armaggon and Verminator X to offset the skill and experience of the future versions of the Turtles.

This version of the character was more in line with the early episodes&#x27; depiction of the character as a cunning adversary and in many issues nearly proves to be a lethal enemy, coming close to defeating the turtles on a number of occasions, even aiding Armaggon and Verminator X in the defeat and capture of two of the turtles in the future. However, he shows some amount of honor in the comic. His final fate within the Archie comics series remains unknown, although a three-part mini-series put out by Archie comics after the end of its regular comic series seems to indicate he remains a consistent foe to the turtles for many years, briefly restoring Splinter to the form of Hamato Yoshi and also undoing Michaelangelo&#x27;s mutation, though both later revert to mutant status by the end of the story, while Shredder was left in a vegetative state in the aftermath of his final battle with the Turtles.

===IDW Publishing===
In feudal Japan, Oroku Saki was a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan along with Hamato Yoshi. While Yoshi focused on his family, Saki surpassed him and was promoted to Jonin (leader) of the Foot. After an argument on his style of leadership, Saki sent ninja to murder Yoshi&#x27;s wife, Tang Shen, and later Yoshi and his four sons.

With the help of Kitsune, Saki steals regenerative ooze from an Utrom known as &quot;The Iron Demon&quot; (later revealed to be Krang himself) which is used to preserve his body until he is awakened by his descendant Oroku Karai several centuries later in modern-day New York. During his time in stasis, his spirit conquered the realm of the Afterlife, where he learned he was destined to rule the earth world and eventually return to the Afterlife as a lost soul. Knowing the future, he vows to change it by conquering the realm of the Afterlife upon his return.

Shredder first appears in Micro-series #1 and in full costume on the final page of issue #9. Dan Duncan first designed Shredder with input from Mateus Santolouco and Kevin Eastman; originally wanting to depict a &quot;beefy...monster&quot; he decided to simplify the design and slimmed down the character based on the original Mirage design.

Seeking control in his forthcoming battle for power, Shredder offers Splinter a place in his army but Splinter refuses, revealing himself to be a reincarnated Hamato Yoshi. Saki then reveals his own identity and attacks Splinter, almost killing him when the Turtles arrive to rescue their father. Impressed by Leonardo, he orders his capture and conducts a plan involving kidnapping and stabbing Casey Jones. Shredder then has Kitsune brainwash Leonardo to become his new Chunin (second-in-command) and uses him for a show of strength to the criminal underworld. After the Turtles rescue Leonardo, Shredder calls a meeting with Krang and proposes an alliance in exchange for Utrom technologies, which Krang rejects. A short battle results in retreat on both sides and the revelation that Shredder had stolen some Utrom resources from Krang&#x27;s compound to begin creating a mutant army (in the form of Bebop, Rocksteady, Koya and Bludgeon).

In Issue #50, Shredder faced Splinter and the turtles in a final battle which he lost and briefly admitted his faults and also making Karai the new head of the Foot Clan in the event of his death. Splinter then retaliated by slashing deep into the back of his head with his sword, killing Shredder instantly.

After his death, Shredder&#x27;s body is kept in a crypt that is guarded by Jennika who was assigned by Hamato Yoshi in order to learn humility. Shredder&#x27;s tomb is eventually desecrated by the witch Kitsune who plans to revive Oroku Saki in order to restore order to the Foot Clan but Splinter knew this and keeps the skull to foil her attempts.

Shredder would reappear in the miniseries &quot;Shredder in Hell&quot;. In this series, Shredder is in the afterlife and descends into the underworld trying to find the truth of his own soul meanwhile Kitsune uses his corpse to summon her father as his host. Shredder also fought his past life Takeshi Tasuo in his inner conflict until Splinter/Hamato Yoshi later shows up to help him against the forces of Hell.

At the time when Mutant Town was established when Old Hob detonated a mutagen bomb the day when Baxter Stockman became the Mayor of New York City, Oroku Saki resurfaces and saves April from some mutant eels that were offspring of the Slithery.

Saki later appears in Old Hob&#x27;s lair, where Old Hob and Man Ray do not recognize him. He frees the weasel children and disappears when he sees Raphael approaching.

As Raphael takes the time to reminisce about Splinter, Saki watches him from afar.

The miniseries &quot;The Last Ronin&quot; is set in an alternate future where most of the Turtles and their allies have been killed by the new Foot Clan, now led by Oroku Hiroto, the son of Karai and grandson of the Shredder. Hiroto has taken control of the entire city of New York and ruled it for the last few decades, considering himself a god in human form. He is ultimately defeated when the resistance are joined by the titular &quot;last Ronin&quot; in the form of Michaelangelo, the last surviving turtle, who has spent years training to avenge his family. The final battle sees Michaelangelo and Hiroto engage in single combat, the Ronin wielding his brothers&#x27; weapons while Hiroto uses a liquid metal armor that can swiftly repair itself and seal off Hiroto&#x27;s injuries. Ultimately Michaelangelo manages to damage the armor and drown Hiroto in the mud outside New York&#x27;s walls, but he dies of his own injuries. However, before his death, Michaelangelo passes on his and Splinter&#x27;s old journal to April and Casey (her daughter), who intend to pass on the lessons from that journal to a new generation of Ninja Turtles created through synthesising mutagen from Casey&#x27;s blood (Casey was born with mutagen from her parents&#x27; prolonged contact with the Turtles), affirming that the Hamato clan legacy will continue even as the Oroku clan will end with Hiroto&#x27;s death.

==Television==
===1987 animated series===
In the 1987 animated series, Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were both members of the Foot Clan in Japan. After Saki framed him for the attempted murder of a visiting sensei, Yoshi was forced to exile himself to New York City, where he lived in the sewers with four pet turtles that were accidentally dropped down a storm drain.

In the following years, Saki took leadership of the Foot Clan and took on his Shredder persona. He also met a trans-dimensional alien called Krang and used the advanced technology at his disposal to replace the Foot Ninja with robots called the Foot Soldiers. He secretly moved to New York, where he found Yoshi still alive. In an attempt to kill his old foe, Shredder dumped mutagen in the sewers. This mutates Yoshi into Splinter, and he starts training the also mutated Turtles in ninjutsu. After the Turtles discovered their operation in New York City, Shredder became their enemy and would stop at nothing until they were defeated, often holding the Turtles&#x27; human ally April O&#x27;Neil captive as bait. 

Shredder was voiced by James Avery for seasons one to seven and William E. Martin for seasons eight and ten, with the alternates being Dorian Harewood and Pat Fraley in 1989, Jim Cummings in 1991–1993 and Townsend Coleman in 1993. In the 2009 crossover movie &quot;Turtles Forever&quot;, the 1987 version of the Shredder was voiced by Load Williams. In the 2012 series, the 1987 version of the Shredder is voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson due to the passing of James Avery in 2013.

====Depiction====
In his early appearances, Shredder was presented as extremely cunning and was described by Splinter himself as the most dangerous adversary he ever faced. Shredder&#x27;s intelligence persevered throughout his various portrayals, and in several instances, it is claimed that Shredder has an IQ of 300. As the 1987 cartoon series was more light-hearted than the comics, Shredder was later depicted as evil but a villain that always fails rather than the dire and lethal ninja he was originally shown to be. He and Krang are constantly bickering about tactics and often take pleasure in the other&#x27;s failings (and sometimes intentionally sabotage each other). His two henchmen Bebop and Rocksteady are especially incompetent and fail miserably at everything they do. They were mostly used for comic relief in the show; however, the Turtles certainly consider them to be formidable (despite their inane stupidity) in combat due to their great strength and endurance, and as such, often use their intelligence to outwit them.

Despite Shredder&#x27;s failings, he is still shown to have considerable skills. In martial arts, he is often shown to surpass the Turtles and to be equaled only by Splinter. Nevertheless, he usually runs away from a fight when outnumbered, incapacitating the Turtles to defeat them in combat; as the series progressed, however, the Turtles were able to battle him on more equal grounds and even defeat him in combat on several occasions. He trained the Punk Frogs in a very short period of time to be a match for the Turtles, but the Punk Frogs soon switch sides. His technical skills are also quite impressive: he designed and built a robotic body for Krang, prepared the mutagen mixture, knew how Krang&#x27;s teleportation engine worked and built numerous other advanced devices. Ironically in one episode &quot;Shredderville&quot; the Turtles dream they find themselves in a mirror universe where they themselves never existed and Shredder rules New York City, yet finds the task of ruling so burdensome that he has a nervous breakdown.

From mid-season seven onwards, Shredder was depicted as a more serious threat, full of anger and bloodlust, though he was still easily defeated by the Turtles. His friendship with Krang also appeared to have grown. There were many times that Shredder could have just left Krang at the mercy of the Turtles or Lord Dregg, but he always rescued him and went as far as to donate his life energy to save him.

====Family====
Shredder&#x27;s family is presented in three episodes. In the episode &quot;Shredder&#x27;s Mom&quot;, Shredder&#x27;s mother Miyoko helps Shredder and Krang in an attempt to destroy the world&#x27;s climate. In this episode, Miyoko first learns of her son&#x27;s criminal activities and proves herself to be villainous. However, she constantly treats Shredder like a baby, until he gets fed up with it and transports her back to her retirement home. In the episode &quot;My Brother, the Bad Guy&quot;, it is revealed that Oroku Saki has a younger brother, Kazuo who works as a police lieutenant in Tokyo. Kazuo and the Turtles try to join forces to stop one of Shredder&#x27;s plans, but his fervent respect for the law clashes with the Turtles&#x27; &quot;whatever it takes&quot; attitude. Finally, the episode &quot;The Legend of Koji&quot; features Saki&#x27;s distant ancestor Oroku Sancho, who lived in Japan in 1583. He is the leader of a small clan, and every bit as wicked as his descendant. When Shredder offers to help him find magical relics that would provide him with power and wealth, Sancho takes Shredder&#x27;s information, then betrays him and orders his men to kill him. However, Sancho is also a coward, and when he breaks down in the face of danger, his men abandon him.

This family tree leads to a bit of confusion regarding whether Shredder&#x27;s given name is Oroku and his last name Saki (as indicated by the fact his brother shares the name Saki), or the other way around (as indicated by the fact his ancestor&#x27;s last name is Oroku). This question is never resolved on the show, although Mirage comics adds more evidence for Oroku being the family name; Saki&#x27;s elder brother is &quot;Oroku Nagi&quot;. This follows Japanese naming conventions, which place the family name before an individual&#x27;s given name.

====Timeline====
Counting from the first meeting with the Turtles, Shredder spent eight seasons plotting ways to defeat them. In the season 8 episode &quot;Turtle Trek&quot;, the Turtles destroy the engines of the Technodrome, trapping it and its inhabitants in Dimension X for good and putting an end to Shredder&#x27;s plans. He spent the next two seasons in Dimension X, until he was contacted by Dregg (&quot;The Power of Three&quot;). Dregg arranged for him and Krang to come back to Earth, to help him fight the Turtles. Together, they capture the Turtles, but Dregg then betrays them and tries to drain the life energy of the Turtles, Krang, and Shredder all at once, making them weaker while Dregg becomes stronger. Shredder alone escapes the trap and restores Krang (&quot;A Turtle in Time&quot;), but Dregg captures them again. Finally, the Turtles spoil Dregg&#x27;s plan and transport Shredder and Krang back to Dimension X (&quot;Turtles to the Second Power&quot;). In the series finale &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot;, the Turtles return to the Technodrome in Dimension X to take Krang&#x27;s android body, which they need to fight Dregg. Shredder is nowhere to be seen, but it is assumed that he is still somewhere in Dimension X.

He and Krang also appear in &quot;Turtles Forever&quot;, with the Technodrome still under New York City before being sent into the 2003 universe. However, Shredder and Krang&#x27;s incompetence (as well as their relative sanity) is fully shown when the Utrom Shredder of the 2003 universe seizes command of the Technodrome and adds Utrom technology to the powerful war machine, and turns it against the world. In the climax, Shredder temporarily overcomes his hatred for the Turtles as both he and Krang decide to help the Turtles defeat the Utrom Shredder who they realize is totally insane, will kill everyone, and has effectively stolen the Technodrome from them. Shredder also takes extreme offense at being considered inferior by his other-dimensional counterpart, does not see the point of destroying the entire universe, and does not understand why the Utrom Shredder refuses to just kill the Turtles when he has the chance. So, with Krang, he chooses to fight alongside the Turtles against their common foe.

===&quot;The Next Mutation&quot;===
In &quot;Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation&quot;, Shredder (portrayed by Patrick Pon, voiced by Doug Parker) is still the Turtles&#x27; sworn enemy. This time, however, Venus uses her powers to make the Oroku Saki from within taking control of Shredder&#x27;s mind. After the Foot Clan disbands, he ends up living on the streets. Later, the Dragon Lord&#x27;s rank warriors attack him to get a medallion that was in his possession. Splinter saves him and takes him to the Turtles&#x27; lair to protect him. It was hinted that Shredder might possibly go back to his old ways, but the show was canceled soon after that episode.

In the show, Shredder wore a general attire similar to the one he wore in the second film, but with a heavily altered helmet/mask due to the lesser budget for the TV series as compared to the movies, which had allowed for more detailed props and costume pieces. Shredder appeared only a few times in the show, due to the main antagonist of the series being a draconic being from another dimension and thus supplanted Shredder as the Turtles&#x27; nemesis.

===2003 animated series===
Various individuals have assumed the mantle of the Shredder in the 2003 animated series, all of whom, except for Karai, are voiced by Scottie Ray, and are considered as the most vile and ruthless incarnations of the character in the entire franchise. In the episode &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;, a possible future is shown in which the Utrom Shredder, Tengu Shredder and Cyber Shredder are engaged in a war for control of New York City.

====Utrom Shredder====
The Utrom Shredder is the main antagonist and the primary Shredder of the series. He serves as the archenemy of the Turtles and Splinter, and indirectly had a hand in their creation.

Ch&#x27;rell (whose aliases include Torrinon, Kako Naso and Duke Acureds) is a megalomaniacal and psychopathic Utrom warlord responsible for the deaths of millions across the universe. Although he was captured by his fellow Utroms, Ch&#x27;rell escaped and caused their ship to crash-land on earth during the Sengoku period of feudal Japan. The stranded Utroms built humanoid exosuits to disguise themselves among the humans. Ch&#x27;rell stole the first working prototype and used the Japanese legend of a Demon Tengu to craft a dual identity, becoming a wealthy Japanese philanthropist named Oroku Saki and a ruthless crime lord known as the Shredder. He founded an underground criminal empire called the Foot Clan to hunt down his former Utrom captors and later adopted an abandoned girl named Karai, whom he personally trained in ninjutsu to lead the Foot Clan in Japan while he moved to New York City to expand their operation. Shredder created important links with the New York underworld, enlisting Hun, the leader of the Purple Dragons, as his right-hand man. In New York, Shredder captures Hamato Yoshi, one of the Utroms&#x27; foremost guardians, and kills him after he refuses to reveal their location. Yoshi&#x27;s pet rat Splinter witnesses his murder and escapes, winding up in the city&#x27;s sewers where he and four baby turtles are accidentally exposed to a mutagenic ooze created by the Utroms, transforming them into sentient humanoid lifeforms.

In the first season set over a decade later, the Turtles begin encountering the Foot Clan and unknowingly foiling several of the Shredder&#x27;s operations. Oroku Saki becomes intrigued with the Turtles, wanting to meet them and hoping to bring them to his side. One day, he invites Leonardo to his home and offers him to join the Foot. However, the Turtles learn of his true nature when Splinter tells them about the Shredder&#x27;s role in Master Yoshi&#x27;s murder. The Shredder eventually becomes the greatest enemy of the Turtles when they reject his offer. During their first engagement, the Shredder proves himself to be more skilled than the Turtles, compelling them to flee and hide. While Shredder and his Foot Ninja search for the Turtles, Splinter finds and regroups them, and plans a counterattack. In a subsequent battle on the rooftops, the Shredder outmatches the Turtles again, but Splinter tricks him into cutting the support for a water tower, which is kicked onto him. The water sweeps Shredder off the building, and the tower collapses to the ground, crushing him. But a few scenes later, Shredder&#x27;s hand emerges from the wreckage of the water tower.

Splinter and the Turtles were unaware of the Shredder&#x27;s survival until months later, one day when Leonardo goes on an outdoor morning training exercise, only to be ambushed by the Foot Clan. He is beaten close to death and sent flying into a window of April O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s antique shop apartment, where the Turtles were staying after Foot Ninjas had marauded their sewer home while they were away. Soon afterward, the Shredder leads an assault on April&#x27;s shop. Overpowered and outnumbered, the Turtles, Splinter, April, and Casey Jones are forced to retreat in a walk-in cooler. The Shredder then burns down the apartment, but the Turtles and their allies evacuate and depart for Casey&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s farmhouse, where they would spend the next three months recuperating.

During this time, they are presumed dead, but Saki orders Baxter Stockman to find evidence that the Turtles died, and is cheated by Stockman into believing so. When Leonardo is completely healed from his injuries, the Turtles and Splinter return to New York to face the Shredder once more. They launch a surprise assault on the Foot headquarters, fighting their way through Shredder&#x27;s minions and eventually reaching his throne. By the end of the battle, Leonardo decapitates The Shredder when they strike each other in one final clash. Not knowing that he is an Utrom, the Turtles believe him to be finally killed for good. After they leave, the Shredder is seen to be getting up and walking away carrying his severed head.

In the second season, Ch&#x27;rell seeks to exact revenge on his species. He infiltrates the TCRI facility, where the Utroms&#x27; base is located and encounters the Turtles and Master Splinter. Despite their efforts, an unconscious Shredder slips out a time bomb, set to detonate in ten minutes. The Turtles help the Utroms escape using the Transmat, a teleportation device, which Donatello activates. After the Utroms teleport back to their homeworld, the Shredder awakens and attacks the Turtles. In the ensuing fight, the Turtles use their weapons to penetrate his armor, which is then shocked by Donatello, disabling it. Afterward, the Shredder reveals his Utrom form to the Turtles, intent on taking down his enemies with him. However, in the last few seconds, Donatello manages to power up the Transmat, through which he, his brothers, and Splinter escape before the TCRI building implode with Ch&#x27;rell inside of it.

With his supposed demise, the Foot Clan, the Purple Dragons, and the New York Mafia clash with each other for control of New York City. Unknown to them, the Shredder had survived once more and was retrieved by his daughter Karai, now being placed in a stasis tube and healed by worms inside a secret medical facility of the Foot headquarters. During his recuperation, Karai assumes leadership of the Foot Clan and makes peace with the Turtles after they help her end the turf war. However, once the Shredder is fully recovered, he vows vengeance and breaks off the truce. By this point, Baxter Stockman had created the Foot Mechs, mainly in the form of armed ninja robots, but in versions of the U.S. president, the English Prime Minister, and Splinter as well. The Shredder&#x27;s plans were again thwarted when the Turtles, Splinter, and their unlikely ally, the Triceraton Zog, locate his barge hideout, leading to another confrontation with the Foot. Aboard the freighter, Donatello programs a bomb set to go off in 30 minutes. The Shredder is defeated again when Zog sacrifices himself by seizing him and jumping into a blazing fire, but Karai rescues him on a helicopter.

In the third season, the Triceratons launch an invasion on Earth. In the aftermath of the invasion, New York City is in ruins. In his persona as Oroku Saki, the Shredder uses his fortune to repair the damage and gains the favor of its citizens, while secretly salvaging the remnants of Triceraton technology to construct a large starship to return to the stars, so he could retaliate against the Utrom. He also promotes Karai to lieutenant and enlists the help of a young scientist named Dr. Chaplin, replacing Hun and Stockman due to their numerous failures. The craft is eventually completed, but Ch&#x27;rell&#x27;s plan suffers several complications, courtesy of the Turtles and the Earth Protection Force (led by Agent Bishop). Despite sustaining heavy damage, the ship is launched into orbit, albeit with the Turtles and Splinter on board. When Karai notes that they left their forces on Earth, Ch&#x27;rell states that he has allies on other worlds that can help him. Entering a four-armed Shredder exo-suit, Ch&#x27;rell easily defeats them all, prompting the Turtles and Splinter to attempt to sacrifice their lives and blow the ship up in a final attempt to stop the Shredder. Luckily, as the starship explodes, Mortu and the Utrom arrive, having placed a stasis field around the entire ship, freezing time, and teleport all its inhabitants to safety. While the Turtles and Splinter are teleported to the infirmary and Professor Honeycutt is taken to one of their labs to be placed in a new robot body, Ch&#x27;rell, Karai, and Dr. Chaplin are teleported to the brig. On the Utrom homeworld, Ch&#x27;rell is placed on trial before the Utrom High Council that is observed by the Turtles, Splinter, Karai, and Professor Honeycutt. The Utrom High Council lists his crimes from launching an attack on the planet Enefgold where over one million innocents perished, incited and funded a civil war on the planet Eno II in an effort to mine their raw minerals without restriction in which 3.2 million perished, and multiple attempts to take control of the Utrom government through an illegal and violent coup. The Utrom High Council then finds Ch&#x27;rell guilty for the chaos and destruction he brought across the universe and ultimately sentence him to eternal exile on the desolate ice asteroid Mor Gal Tal.

In the finale film &quot;Turtles Forever&quot;, Ch&#x27;rell is freed from his exile by his Shredder counterpart from the 1987 series after his frozen body was teleported off of Mor Gal Tal by the 1980s Shredder and Krang. Once Karai showed up upon finding out about Ch&#x27;rell&#x27;s return, Ch&#x27;rell then takes over the Technodrome and gains a new, more powerful exo-suit. After realigning with a now-mutated Hun, Ch&#x27;rell reverse-engineers the mutagen that Hun got to turn a select number of Cyber Foot into Mutant Foot Soldiers and create new Foot Robots that are stronger than the &#x27;80s versions. The Ch&#x27;rell later uses the Technodrome to view alternate dimensions, realizing that there is an entire multiverse of Ninja Turtles. Locating the Turtles&#x27; source planet, Turtle Prime, Ch&#x27;rell vows to eliminate every Ninja Turtle in existence by destroying this dimension. The Mirage Turtles, the 1987 Turtles, and the 2003 Turtles team up to defeat Ch&#x27;rell and Ch&#x27;rell is ultimately disintegrated by an energy beam as he screams in agony though Karai and Splinter agree that the Shredder will return again as he always does.

In &quot;Same As It Never Was&quot;, Donatello is transported to an alternate future in which the Shredder has succeeded in subjugating Earth. By then, Splinter had died protecting his sons and Casey Jones died fighting the Foot Clan. Ch&#x27;rell also severed Michelangelo&#x27;s left arm and Raphael&#x27;s left eye. When Donatello leads a final rebellion against the Shredder&#x27;s fortress, his Foot forces kill Michelangelo while Karai kills Leonardo and Raphael. April avenges Leonardo and Raphael by using a rocket launcher on Karai, and the Shredder is killed by Donatello with the Tuneller.

In &quot;Timing is Everything&quot;, Leonardo and Cody Jones are accidentally sent back in time to the aftermath of the Turtles&#x27; first battle with the Shredder. Later, the Shredder and several Foot ninjas are transported to 2105 but are easily defeated by the Turtles&#x27; futuristic technology.

In the IDW comic series, Ch&#x27;rell appears as a separate individual from the Shredder.

====Karai====
Karai is the adopted daughter of the Utrom Shredder. She takes on the mantle of the Shredder and continues her father&#x27;s legacy following his exile, though she later renounces the title and begins a non-hostile relationship with the Turtles.

====Tengu Shredder====
The original Shredder was a demonic Tengu from hell that terrorized ancient Japan. On the verge of death after being defeated by the Five Dragon warriors, it made a deal with Oroku Saki; if Saki allowed the demon to enter and possess him, he would gain all of its power. Saki became the next Shredder but his reign of terror ended when his former comrades, now the Ninja Tribunal, captured and entombed him. The Tengu Shredder is only resurrected centuries later by his five mystic heralds, forcing the Ninja Tribunal to recruit the Turtles and all of their allies to stand against him. Karai uses a mystic link shared by all who take on the mantle of the Shredder to weaken the demon, allowing the Turtles to summon the spirit of Hamato Yoshi and deliver the final blow, destroying the Tengu Shredder once and for all.

====Cyber Shredder====
The Cyber Shredder is an artificial intelligence and a digital copy of Ch&#x27;rell created in the event of his demise. The futuristic Viral accidentally releases this copy of Ch&#x27;rell&#x27;s consciousness, creating the Cyber Shredder. While he is initially confined to cyberspace, the Cyber Shredder ultimately manages to escape and become a physical being. In the final episode of the series, he leads the Foot Clan in an attack on April O&#x27;Neil and Casey Jones&#x27;s wedding. The Cyber Shredder is finally destroyed when the Turtles erase him with a de-compiler previously used against Viral.

===2012 animated series===
The Shredder appears in the 2012 animated series, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson.

His Japanese origins as Oroku Saki and brotherly relationship with Hamato Yoshi is mostly intact, with the Foot Clan and the Hamato Clan being later revealed as having a long-term rivalry before the Hamato family killed the Oroku family, wiped out their entire clan (starting with the destruction of the Foot Clan monastery) and took in the orphaned Saki as their own. Despite being raised as brothers, both Saki and Yoshi eventually became rivals due to the love of Tang Shen, whose decision to marry Yoshi drove Saki to discover his true heritage and turn on his former brother, eventually destroying everything Yoshi held dear, including Tang Shen (whom he had killed by accident) and the entire Hamato Clan (starting with the destruction of the Hamato Clan monastery, which resulted with Saki&#x27;s head getting burned, scarred, and hairless). Blaming Tang Shen&#x27;s untimely death on Yoshi, Saki returned to his biological family and became the new leader of the newly restored Foot Clan, tutoring ninjutsu students such as world-famous martial artist Chris Bradford and Brazilian street thug Xever Montes, sharing criminal business with business partners such as Russian arms dealer Ivan Steranko, Sicilian mob boss Don Visiozo, and Purple Dragons leader Hun. In addition, he also a pet akita named Hachiko (named after the akita of the same name) who played a part in Bradford&#x27;s mutation into Dogpound after Hachiko bit him. Shredder began wearing the Kuro Kabuto, a helmet that served as his symbol of power over the Foot Clan.

Shredder first appeared at the end of &quot;Rise of the Turtles, Part 2&quot; where he traveled to New York when he learned that Hamato Yoshi is training his own ninjas after seeing his clan symbol on a shuriken left behind by the Turtles during a recent fight on a TV news report. Determined to finally end his age-old rival&#x27;s life, he sent the Foot Clan after the Turtles until he made his first confrontation with the Turtles in person in &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, where victory was seemingly in his grasp before he was distracted by the mutating Bradford and Montes. Although Shredder planned to kill former TCRI inventor Baxter Stockman for interfering with his plans to kill the Turtles in &quot;MOUSERS Attack&quot;, he changed his mind by commenting on how Stockman&#x27;s scientific knowledge could be useful to him. Shredder is also Karai&#x27;s father, as seen in &quot;New Girl in Town&quot;. However, in &quot;Showdown&quot;, during Shredder&#x27;s battle with Splinter, he reveals that in the aftermath of the fight that caused Tang Shen&#x27;s death, he took Splinter&#x27;s daughter, Miwa, and raised her as Karai. He has told her that he is her biological father and it was Splinter who killed her mother, as she has sworn revenge ever since. Shredder initially dismissed the Kraang&#x27;s presence in New York, but after capturing one, decided to ally with them to destroy the Turtles. The partnership seems stable, though it would seem the Shredder still did not fully trust his new allies.

Early in the second season, in &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;, he left for Japan to deal with a situation, leaving Karai as the interim leader of his Foot Clan. He ordered her not to attack the Turtles nor make any dealings with the Kraang behind his back and was livid when his adoptive daughter disobeyed him. He returned in &quot;The Manhattan Project&quot;, with Tiger Claw, a Japanese circus performer who was mutated into Shredder&#x27;s deadly assassin and new first lieutenant. Tiger Claw was able to bring Splinter before him, but complications from a Kraang operation in the city and the Turtles&#x27; own efforts rob Shredder of his chance to kill his old foe once again. In &quot;The Wrath of Tiger Claw&quot;, Shredder and Tiger Claw attempted to use Karai to set a trap for the Turtles, but when she saw a photograph of Hamato Yoshi, Tang Shen, and herself as an infant, she realized that the Turtles were telling the truth and sided with them, resulting in her being captured while buying them time to escape Tiger Claw. Shredder still cared about his adoptive daughter, though, as seen in &quot;The Legend of the Kuro Kabuto&quot;, where he visited her in her cell and explained why he kept everything a secret and hoped that she will one day understand. In &quot;Vengeance is Mine&quot;, Shredder attempted to use Karai as bait for a trap that would mutate the Turtles into snakes that would kill Splinter, but the plan backfired when Karai was exposed to the mutagen, turning into a snake and almost attacking Splinter before she fled after regaining control of herself.

In the two-part second-season finale &quot;The Invasion&quot;, Shredder and Kraang Prime formed a full alliance in which Shredder and the Foot Clan will help the Kraang take over New York and then the world, and in turn, the Kraang would return Karai to normal, and deliver Splinter and the Turtles to him. Shredder subsequently injured Leo and fought Splinter and Leatherhead, defeating the pair and seemingly killing the former. During the Kraang occupation of the city, Shredder conscripted Steranko and Anton Zeck as new mutant members of his clan and had them recapture Karai for him. The Kraang invasion eventually was defeated by the Turtles and the Mighty Mutanimals, and Shredder uses the chaos of post-invasion New York to take firm control of the city&#x27;s criminal underworld, using his connections to gather materials for a mind-control serum that he planned to create and use on the Turtles, the Mutanimals, and Karai. Though he successfully brainwashed Karai to return to his side, she overcame the treatment and fled again. In the two-part season 3 finale, &quot;Annihilation: Earth!&quot; he briefly teams up with Splinter to stop a black hole machine that was to destroy the Earth. He briefly fought the Triceratons until he followed Splinter, double-crossing and stabbing him in the back, killing him instantly in front of the turtles. Proclaiming that his victory over Splinter is more important to him than even saving the world, Shredder is sucked into the black hole along with his followers and Splinter while the turtles, April and Casey escape Earth&#x27;s destruction. In &quot;Beyond the Known Universe&quot;, the Turtles travel back in time to six months earlier in an effort to prevent this event from happening. In &quot;Earth&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; these events were revisited, but the arrival of the Turtles from the future resulted in Shredder&#x27;s attempt to murder Splinter being thwarted. The two engaged briefly in battle with Splinter proving victorious, and the unconscious Shredder was carried away by Tiger Claw.

A critically injured Shredder ordered Stockman to mutate him to give him the power needed to exact his revenge. In &quot;The Super Shredder&quot;, the Shredder mutates into his Super Shredder form, becoming a far more powerful opponent for the Turtles and their allies. In &quot;Requiem&quot;, he returns to New York City and faces off against Splinter, Slash, Raphael, April, and Casey. He ultimately manages to murder Splinter, whom he hurls from the building to his death. In the season four finale &quot;Owari&quot; he has his lackeys prepare for the inevitable arrival of the Turtles, April, and Casey. He burns down his new lair and confronts the Turtles in a final showdown on the roof. His unique mutation makes him immune to Donatello&#x27;s retro-mutagen, which allows him to beat Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo all at once, leaving only Leonardo left standing. After a heated one-on-one duel, Shredder is finally killed by Leonardo.

Many months later, the Kabuto and his own heart were separated by unknown means and hidden in secret locations throughout New York. His heart was contained within a glass vial that came into the possession of Don Vzioso, which Tiger Claw and a demodragon named Kavaxas seek, as it is essential to revive him and then came back in a zombie-like form that was later revealed to be under Kavaxas’ control. But thanks to Michelangelo&#x27;s quick thinking and some chewed gum, Zombie Shredder was able to drag Kavaxas back to the Netherworld as they &quot;[did] not belong here&quot; in the mortal world.

===2018 animated series===

Shredder appears in &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, voiced by Hoon Lee.

500 years before the series, Oroku Saki was the leader of the peaceful Foot Clan and father of the Hamato Clan founder, Karai, whose soul was swallowed by the demonic and nigh-unstoppable Kuroi Yōroi armor after it was forged by a powerful Oni (in reality the alien Krang). After being transformed into the Shredder, Saki led the Foot down a path of darkness, unleashing unspeakable chaos across Japan in the process. With no other choice, Karai was forced to create her own clan, the Hamato Clan, to end the demon&#x27;s reign of terror. Shredder continuted terrorized Japan until he was defeated by Karai using her mystic Hamato Ninpō energy (since no mortal weapon could harm Shredder) to send him into a dimension called the Twilight Realm, and the Kuroi Yōroi was scattered across the world to prevent his return. The side effect of Shredder&#x27;s defeat had sent Karai into the Twilight Realm, along with Shredder&#x27;s sapience being sealed away. In the aftermath, Karai&#x27;s remaining followers made it their sworn duty to watch over the armor pieces and never allow the Foot to reclaim them.

The Foot, allied with Baron Draxum, began collecting the armor pieces to resurrect him starting in &quot;Shadow of Evil&quot;, with the Yōkai alchemist being promised of its dark power to protect his people from an ancient prophecy predicting their destruction.

In &quot;Warren and Hypno, Sitting in a Tree&quot;, Draxum claimed the gauntlet in Warren Stone&#x27;s possession that turned out to be part of the Kuroi Yōroi.

In &quot;Operation: Normal&quot;, the Foot Brute and the Foot Recruit targeted the slime Yōkai, Sunita, because the boots she was wearing were part of the Kuroi Yōroi. They managed to claim them.

In &quot;How to Make Enemies and Bend People to Your Will&quot;, Draxum and the Foot Recruit found out that a Kuroi Yōroi fragment was at the Botanical Gardens. They claimed it after setting up events where the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute would fail. After obtaining the fragment, Draxum declared himself to be the Foot&#x27;s leader, via exploiting a loophole in the clan&#x27;s rulings of leadership. However, Draxum was completely oblivious to the fact that the Foot were just manipulating him into reviving their &quot;true&quot; leader, as they needed a being of great mystic power to don and energize the armor in order to resurrect Shredder (though they were unaware that Shredder would not regain his sapience upon resurrection).

In &quot;One Man&#x27;s Junk&quot;, the next piece of the Kuroi Yōroi was in the possession of Repo Mantis, who claimed it from a Yōkai and held in his salvage yard. After trapping the cat/mantis mutant, Mrs. Nubbins who was owned by Repo Mantis, the Turtles learn that two fire-headed guys working as shoe salesmen bought the metal from him. This caused the Turtles to learn that the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute claimed the metal.

After the Kuroi Yōroi was completed in &quot;End Game&quot;, Draxum donned the armor, intent on destroying humanity once and for all in his misguided quest to protect the Yōkai. The Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute addressed him as Shredder, but he rejected the title, confused with the name &quot;Shredder&quot;. Furthermore, due to a flaw in the armor (the Turtles&#x27; Jupiter Jim action figure was shoved in to cover a hole when the faceplate was used as a tea kettle), it was not able to properly absorb Draxum&#x27;s power. After Draxum was defeated and spat out of the armor, due to April knocking a baseball against the action figure, it reassembled itself, having drained Draxum of his life force.

In &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot;, Shredder acted like a feral beast, due to his sapience still being sealed in the Twilight Realm. During the chaos, a heavily weakened Draxum used his remaining strength to escape through a portal the Foot Recruit opened to assist the Brute and Lieutenant. After being attacked by the demon, the Foot Lieutenant, Foot Brute, and Foot Recruit retreated to find out what went wrong. After discovering a flux in Shredder&#x27;s quantum energy, causing him to randomly phase in and out between Earth and the Twilight Realm, Big Mama was able to provide a mystic collar for the Turtles and Splinter to trap Shredder in another dimension, though she made a secret last-minute alteration to this plan.

In &quot;Battle Nexus: New York,&quot; Big Mama secretly attached a control device and its associated magic ring to the Shredder and controlled him under the alias of Shadow Fiend. This was discovered during the Turtles, Splinter, April, and the redeemed and recovering Draxum&#x27;s fight with Big Mama. When the ring was removed from Big Mama during the fight, the Foot Recruit claimed it. Before Leonardo could portal Big Mama out during their escape, she got cut off. The Foot Recruit, furious that her master was enslaved, ominously told Big Mama that she was about to lose everything and advised her to run. The Shredder then destroyed the Grand Nexus Hotel, flying out into the city with the Foot Recruit on his back.

Afterwards, the Foot Recruit tried to take the collar of the Shredder to no avail until the Turtles, seeking a way to defeat him, learned of a weapon in the Twilight Realm, who is actually Karai, and brought her back and Shredder regained his sapience in the process. The Shredder along with the Foot Recruit, the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute, with the intent to destroy Karai and take her power for himself, attacked the Turtle&#x27;s lair, with the lair destroyed and Karai defeated, the Turtles escaped with Todd while Splinter and Draxum remained behind to buy them time and got captured.

After Karai&#x27;s death, Shredder did not claim her power, the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute told him to extract Splinter&#x27;s essence using Empyrean, the source of Yōkai power, Draxum offered him Empyrean and took them into his lab, however, this was a ruse as Draxum now realized that Shredder was the threat to the Yōkai mentioned in the prophecy and tried to distract him and get away with Splinter but failed and forced to lead Shredder to Empyrean. In the Crying Titan Shredder starts extracting Yoshi&#x27;s essence with the Empyrean but Turtles arrive with their Hamato ninpo unlocked and Karai&#x27;s spirit within April&#x27;s body and fight him but are overwhelmed, Shredder tries to absorb Yoshi&#x27;s essence but Foot Recruit, having a change of heart, saves Splinter. The Turtles and Splinter with the help of their allies and the spirit of ancient Hamatos, destroy Shredder&#x27;s armor and free Oroku Saki, who thanks the turtles and company for releasing him, before his spirit moves on to the afterlife.

==Films==
The Shredder was played by James Saito in the first movie and by François Chau in the second, while his immense Super Shredder form was played by professional wrestler Kevin Nash. In all cases, the character was voiced by David McCharen. Oroku Saki (in flashback form) is played by an unknown stuntman. 
The Shredder&#x27;s costume was, in the first movie, originally the same as in the original comic, with a red color. However, this was changed in the sequel to a violet color, reflecting the more cartoonish nature of the second film. In both movies, he also had a silver and black cape. In both films, he is served by his second-in-command Tatsu. In the Japanese dubs, the Shredder is voiced by Norio Wakamoto (first movie, VHS release), Hidekatsu Shibata (first movie, television broadcast), and Takeshi Watabe (second movie).

===&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (1990)===
In the first movie &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were rival martial artists in Japan and both loved a woman named Tang Shen. Shen, who loved only Yoshi, persuaded him not to fight Saki honorably; instead, they fled for the United States. Saki followed them to New York City; when Yoshi returned home from his construction job he found his beloved Shen lying dead on the floor, he was ambushed and overpowered by Saki. Saki wasted no words and during the struggle, Splinter&#x27;s cage was broken. Splinter leaped up onto Saki&#x27;s face, biting and clawing, but the rogue ninja threw him to the floor and took one swipe with his katana, slicing Splinter&#x27;s ear. After this incident, it was said that Saki is never heard from again. The comic book adaptation of the film retains the original comic book origin story, with Oroku Nagi being slain and Saki coming to America to seek vengeance.

Saki, in his &quot;Shredder&quot; persona, establishes an American branch of the Foot Clan. With the aid of his second-in-command Tatsu, he manipulates and recruits troubled teens as a brutal yet Machiavellian leader and father figure, teaching them ninjitsu to make them into skilled thieves and assassins. Shredder sends the Foot Clan to &quot;silence&quot; April O&#x27;Neil when she reports on the Foot Clan&#x27;s connection to the recent crime wave, inadvertently leading them to the Turtles&#x27; hideout when Raphael saves April. Shredder had Splinter kidnapped and imprisoned him in his warehouse hideout, and has the Foot Clan hunt the Turtles. He beats Splinter while interrogating him about how the Turtles learned their fighting techniques.

After the Turtles successfully defeat the Foot Clan in a final assault, Shredder confronts them on a rooftop. He defeats all of the Turtles with his superior skills and threatens Leonardo with his yari to force the others to toss away their weapons. Splinter, freed by Turtles&#x27; allies, Danny Pennington and Casey Jones, intervenes and reveals to Shredder that they met years ago, as he was Hamato Yoshi&#x27;s pet. Shredder unmasks himself, revealing the scars that Splinter gave him, and charges Splinter to impale him. Splinter counters with Michelangelo&#x27;s nunchaku to send him over the side of the roof. Shredder throws a tanto at Splinter. Splinter caught the knife, but had to let go of the nunchaku that was holding onto the spear, making Shredder fall into a parked garbage truck far below. Casey Jones then activates the crushing mechanism; the viewers are then shown a closeup of Shredder&#x27;s helmet being crushed, implying his death.

===&quot;TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot; (1991)===
In the second movie &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot;, the Shredder was played by François Chau, replacing Saito. In the film, the Turtles believe that since Casey had crushed him in the garbage truck, the Shredder was dead. It is soon revealed that Shredder had survived the crushing and revitalized his Foot Clan to get vengeance on the Turtles. After finding the Foot &quot;fallback&quot; headquarters in a junkyard, Tatsu was asking who would challenge him to cover for Shredder until Shredder appeared. Tatsu allowed Shredder to lead the Foot Clan. Shredder sent a member of the Foot to follow April, hoping to find the Turtles through her. When April&#x27;s team was doing a report on T.G.R.I. in New Jersey, April&#x27;s camera operator/Foot Clan member Freddy found some mutated dandelions and sent one to the Shredder. He then orders Tatsu to obtain a sample of the T.G.R.I. mutagen that mutated the Turtles, as well as kidnap researcher Jordan Perry. Using the last mutagen and Perry&#x27;s research, the Shredder creates his own mutants, Tokka and Rahzar, from a stolen snapping turtle and a brown wolf respectively. Though initially enraged at their infant-like intelligence, he soon plays it to his advantage by manipulating the mutants as they imprinted him as their surrogate parent.

After a failed attempt to kill the Turtles in the junkyard using a captured Raphael, Shredder unleashed Tokka and Rahzar onto a city street to &quot;have fun&quot; and destroy it. The Foot spy then gave April a message for the Turtles: that the Shredder would turn the mutants loose on Central Park next if they did not accede to a rematch at the construction site. After the Turtles de-mutate the two mutants (with help from Perry) and defeat Tatsu in a nightclub, the Shredder appears and threatens to mutate an innocent woman with a small reserve mutagen vial (the canister was knocked away by the Turtles&#x27; new human ally, Keno). Before he can mutate her, he is stopped when the Turtles play a keytar at full volume, sending the Shredder flying through a window from the force of a blown speaker. When the Turtles follow him outside on a pier, they discover that the Shredder has used the mutagen vial on himself. He is transformed into a massive &quot;Super Shredder&quot;, an almost mindless giant-mutant being with immense superhuman strength. During his fight with the Turtles, Super Shredder in his furious desire to bring down the turtles with him knocks down the pier&#x27;s pilings in a mindless rage, which then collapses onto him with the Turtles falling into the water below. Though the Turtles survive, the Shredder meets his demise from getting crushed by the destroyed pieces of the pier.

===&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot; (1993) and &quot;TMNT&quot; (2007)===
The Shredder did not appear in the third film but is shown briefly at the beginning of the fourth film to help give the backstory of the Turtles, and his helmet that he wore in the 1990 film is visible on Splinter&#x27;s shelf of mementos at the end of the movie. The possibility of his return is also strongly hinted at the end of the film by Karai. However, the established storyline was abandoned in favor of the 2014 reboot.

===&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2014)===
Japanese American actor Tohoru Masamune portrayed the Shredder in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. Initially, William Fichtner was intended to portray a Caucasian version of the Shredder, with the anglicized real name of Eric Sacks, instead of Oroku Saki. This idea was abandoned late in production in favor of featuring a Shredder of authentic Japanese ancestry, and the film went through re-shoots to change Fichtner&#x27;s character of Sacks into being the Shredder&#x27;s student. The change came too late to alter the film&#x27;s Nintendo 3DS tie-in video game, and Sacks remains the Shredder in it. In contrast to much of the brand&#x27;s history, Sacks, not Shredder, is the character connected to the Turtles&#x27; origins, having created them alongside April O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s father; the Shredder (never referred to with any name other than his codename) has no connection to Splinter or the Turtles, and while he is shown to have scars on his face, it is not revealed how he suffered them.

In the earliest stages of development for the film, Shredder was reimagined as &quot;Colonel Schrader&quot;, the military leader of the black-ops unit &quot;The Foot&quot;, revealed later in the script to be a yellow-skinned, red-eyed alien with the ability to sprout spikes. This idea was dropped after Evan Daugherty was hired to rewrite the script in early 2013.

In the film, Shredder is the leader of the Foot Clan, who is terrorizing New York City. After a vigilante stops the Foot Clan, Shredder orders the Foot to take hostages down the subway in order to lure the vigilante out. Later in the film, Shredder&#x27;s adopted son, Eric Sacks, informs Shredder that the vigilante is in fact four mutated Turtles who are test subjects of Project Renaissance, a science experiment of April O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s late father. Sacks give Shredder an armed suit and a helmet, the latter and the Foot Clan attack the Turtles&#x27; lair, where he defeats Splinter and kidnaps three Turtles after Raphael was presumed dead. Sacks drains the Turtles&#x27; blood in order to create a mutagen so that he can complete his and Shredder&#x27;s plan: the latter will release a virus across the city and Sacks will sell the mutagen as a cure for the disease, making him even richer. As Shredder prepares to release the virus, the Turtles escape and confront him. Although he nearly defeats them, the Turtles were able to conquer Shredder with the help of April, which causes him to fall from the building on which he stood, but he survives and is shown to have a sample of the mutagen.

===&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot; (2016)===
Brian Tee portrayed Shredder in the 2016 film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;. At the beginning of the movie, the Foot Clan, led by a scientist named Baxter Stockman, attempts to help Shredder escape from prison. Although the turtles try to prevent the escape, Stockman was able to help Shredder escape using a teleportation device. But Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport and ends up in a place called Dimension X. There, he meets Krang, who gives Shredder a mutagen canister in exchange for a promise to find the three components of a machine that Krang sent to Earth long ago, which when united will open a portal to his dimension. Shredder returns to New York City and recruits two criminals named Bebop and Rocksteady and has Stockman use Krang&#x27;s mutagen to transform them into powerful animal mutants- a warthog and rhinoceros. Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady find the components in a museum in New York and in a jungle in Brazil. Shredder and Stockman unite the components, creating a portal to Krang&#x27;s dimension. Shredder betrays Stockman and has his men take him away, but upon entering the Technodrome, Krang immediately betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him away with his collection of other defeated foes.

===&quot;Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2019)===
Andrew Kishino voices Shredder in the crossover animated film &quot;Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. In the film, Shredder allies his forces with Ra&#x27;s al Ghul and the League of Assassins to build a machine designed to transform Gotham&#x27;s citizens into unhinged mutants. In exchange for his assistance, Ra&#x27;s promises Shredder access to one of his Lazarus Pits, which would grant him eternal life. When he and the Foot Clan try to steal a cloud seeder from Wayne Enterprises, he ends up fighting Batman and barely comes out victorious after using an ancient technique.

Later, he fights Batman once more when the Turtles and the Bat-Family arrive at Ace Chemicals to stop him and Ra&#x27;s from activating the machine. Though he gains the upper hand on the Dark Knight once again, he is thrown off when Batman says &quot;Cowabunga&quot; and gains assistance from Raphael. Batman defeats Shredder in the fight. After Michaelangelo and Donatello destroy the machine, the debris sends him into a vat of chemicals as the plant explodes. In the post-credits scene, he is revealed to have survived the explosion and now strongly resembles and laughs like the Joker.

===&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot; (2023)===
The Shredder makes a silent cameo appearance in the post-credits scene of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot;, where TCRI executive Cynthia Utrom plans to hire him to recapture the Ninja Turtles.

==Video games==
As the original &quot;TMNT&quot; video games are mostly based on the 1987 cartoon, Shredder is often based on his first cartoon incarnation. He usually executes some plan to provoke the Turtles into retaliating and defeat them; these include kidnapping April O&#x27;Neil and stealing the Statue of Liberty. Shredder is usually the last boss in the games.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (NES, 1989): Shredder is the final boss. He is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He causes the Turtles to lose roughly half their energy if he touches them, and has a gun that can de-mutate them, which instantly kills them. He wears a red costume like in the Mirage comics.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (arcade, 1989): Once again, Shredder is the final boss and is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He is armed with a sword, and has the ability to clone himself (the exact number of clones is one more than the number of Turtles attacking him in the arcade version). Shredder and his clones also have the ability to shoot lightning bolts from a device on the helmet, which de-mutate the Turtles they hit, killing them. When Shredder or one of his clones is close to death, his helmet falls off, a unique occurrence in the game series.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan&quot; (1990): This game was the first one not to feature Shredder as the final boss. Instead, Shredder is the boss of the penultimate stage, which is set in a river. It is also the first game in which Shredder does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles. His only attack is a sword swipe, but he can teleport if hit. The final boss is Krang.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Manhattan Missions&quot; (1991): In this PC game, Shredder fights the turtles in his Manhattan hideout, decorated in a Japanese style. His appearance is based on the Mirage comic version.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project&quot; (1992): This game is the first to feature both a battle against Shredder and a second one against a mutated Super Shredder. The first battle takes place at the end of the Technodrome level, which is the sixth of the eight levels of the game. In this battle, Shredder uses a sword to attack the Turtles. Shredder later returns as the final boss of the game, on the stage set in Krang&#x27;s spacecraft. This time, he mutates himself into Super Shredder, much as he did in the second movie which had been released earlier the same year (1991). Super Shredder has two superpowers, the ability to call down lightning, and the ability to shoot fireballs. These fireballs can de-mutate the Turtles, but unlike other games, this is not an instant kill.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers&quot; (1991): A sequel to &quot;Fall of the Foot Clan&quot;, this game also features Shredder as a regular level boss and Krang as the final boss. He does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles, but he does have a wider variety of attacks than in the previous Game Boy game. Shredder returns later in his mutated Super Shredder form, as a sub-level boss of the final Technodrome level. However, in this incarnation, his only super-power is the ability to teleport elsewhere on the screen. He attacks the Turtles using a sword.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time&quot; (1991): Shredder is again the final boss of the game, and found in the Technodrome. However, this time, he is not preceded by a Technodrome level. Instead, the Turtles fight through a Starbase level in the future (2100 AD) with Krang as boss, then teleport to the Technodrome in the present (1991 in the arcade game and 1992 in the SNES version) for the final confrontation. Shredder attacks with a sword, and can fire energy attacks. In the SNES port of the game, Shredder begins the battle by mutating himself into Super Shredder and has the added superpowers of super-speed movement, fire ground attacks, ice air attacks, and a de-mutating fireball which costs a turtle a life. The SNES port also added a Technodrome level earlier in the game, which leads to a battle with a regular Shredder. In this battle, Shredder is in a kind of battle tank, armed with a machine gun and claws. The player views the action over Shredder&#x27;s shoulder inside the tank, and the only way to cause damage is to hurl the never-ending waves of Foot Soldiers toward the screen and into the tank.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist&quot; (1992): This game uses a Super Shredder similar to the one in &quot;Turtles in Time&quot;. His attacks are roughly the same.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue&quot; (1993): Unlike its two predecessors, &quot;Fall of the Foot Clan&quot; and &quot;Back from the Sewers&quot;, this game does feature Shredder as the final boss. However, this time Shredder has become Cyber Shredder, half-man, and half-machine. This form of Shredder possessed deadly kick moves and energy ball attacks, as well as being the only boss in the game with two life meters, as the meter instantly refills after it is drained the first time.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters&quot; (1993): This is the first game in which Shredder is not a boss but instead a regular playable character. Furthermore, his costume is based on the Mirage comics version. Finally, in the SNES incarnation of this game, he appears under the name Cyber-Shredder, but there is no indication that he has become a cybernetic being as in &quot;Radical Rescue&quot;.

After a 10-year hiatus, a new series of &quot;TMNT&quot; games was initiated. These new games are based on the 2003 cartoon series, and likewise, Shredder in the games is the same as in the cartoon.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2003): Shredder appears as the final boss. The Turtles face him on the helicarrier at the top of the Foot Helicarriers; he wields the Sword of Tengu in this fight. Shredder&#x27;s combo attacks are quick and nearly continuous. When half of his health bar has been depleted, his attacks become much faster. There is also a secret final boss in which the player faces Shredder as Oroku Saki. His combos are much quicker and deadlier, and he also has a temporary powered-up state.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus&quot; (2004): The game begins a short while before the end of the previous game, and Shredder is encountered by the Turtles in the second stage of the game; however, he is not fought by the player, only in a cutscene. As in the cartoon, Shredder is defeated, but he survives the assault on his headquarters. Shredder resurfaces in the TCRI building later on, but once again, the player does not directly fight him; the main goal of the mission being to evacuate the Utroms back to their home planet. He is seemingly killed in the destruction of the TCRI building, but he once again survives. In a subplot exclusive to the game, he is detailed as being a mass murderer of Utroms on their homeworld, and he gave Utrom mercenary Slashuur a permanent scar. He later employed an amnesiac Slashuur to kill the Turtles. However, Slashuur eventually remembers his past, and with the Turtles, battles Shredder and the Foot on his ship. The Turtles eventually defeat Shredder once again. In the Battle Nexus fighting tournament mode, Shredder appears as the final boss of the Foot Fight tournament, though the nature of these tournaments when it comes to the game&#x27;s canon is questionable.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee&quot; (2005): Shredder appeared as a playable character and opponent in three forms—his standard armor, without the armor (as Oroku Saki), and a golden &quot;Mega&quot; Shredder.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare&quot; (2005) The third chapter of the game, &quot;Exodus&quot;, deals directly with the Turtles thwarting the Foot&#x27;s efforts. As in the third-season finale, the Turtles and Splinter battle the Foot at their headquarters, and follow the Shredder aboard his starship. They nearly sacrifice themselves to kill Shredder as well, but the Utroms rescue them, and exile Shredder to a distant ice asteroid forever. Shredder is also encountered in the dark future as one of the final bosses of the Nightmare chapter of the game.
* &quot;TMNT&quot; (2007): In the console versions of the 2007 movie-based game, Shredder appears as a boss in a flashback-within-a-flashback (as the events of the game are told to Splinter after their occurrence). The armor of Shredder in this game is based on the 2003 cartoon series version.
* &quot;TMNT: Smash Up&quot; (2009): Shredder is a playable character in the PS2 and Wii fighting game. He appears in both his Utrom Shredder and Cyber Shredder forms.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot; (2013): Shredder appears as both the penultimate and final boss of the game. He recruits Baxter Stockman to build a new helmet for him using stolen Krang technology, which gives him telekinetic powers, including the ability to fly. Shredder is first fought in his lair when the Turtles come to save April and learn about his scheme. After escaping, he has fought again in the Krangs&#x27; secret underground facility, this time donning his new helmet built by Stockman. He is ultimately defeated by the Turtles, who destroy his helmet, leaving him to swear revenge.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2014): The Nintendo 3DS game based on the 2014 film, Shredder, who is actually Eric Sacks, appears as the final boss. However, after defeating him, it is revealed that it was all an illusion created by Baxter Stockman, to allow the real Shredder to escape.
* &quot;Nickelodeon Kart Racers&quot; (2018): Shredder appears as a non-playable background character in the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; tracks, based on the 2012 incarnation.
* &quot;Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix&quot; (2020): Shredder appears as a playable driver, once again based on his 2012 appearance.
* &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl&quot; (2021): Shredder appears as a playable character as part of a free update, based on his 1987 appearance.
*Shredder appears as a boss in the 2022 beat-&#x27;em-up &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. He&#x27;s first fought in his usual form, then appears again as the final boss as Super Shredder, a mutated, ultimate form affected by the mutagen.

==Other appearances==
In the anime adaptation &quot;Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen&quot;, the backstory from the original cartoon was preserved. Unlike the rest of the main cast, Shredder&#x27;s appearance was changed to match the &quot;Supermutants&quot; Shredder toy that was being sold at that time. The manga explained this by saying his original outfit was destroyed in a battle with the Turtles and Krang created the new armor for him. Shredder also gains the ability to transform into the dragon Devil Shredder using the Mutanite crystals he stole from the Neutrinos. With the energy from the evil sprite Dark Mu, he was later able to transform into the gigantic Dark Devil Shredder. In the second volume of the anime, he gets his Tiger Spirit &quot;Metal Mutant&quot; armor. He was voiced by Kiyoyuki Yanada.

Shredder also made a guest appearance in an episode of the YouTube show &quot;Death Battle&quot;. In the episode, his weapons and abilities were analyzed against &quot;X-Men&quot; villain Silver Samurai. In the end, Shredder proved himself the better fighter and beat his opponent.

Shredder appears as a limited-time purchasable character for the KorTac faction in the first-person shooter video game &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II&quot;. This version of the character is based on the original comic book appearance.

A Colonel Ch&#x27;rell appears in the IDW comics as a member of the Utrom military, kept in stasis in the Technodrome. 

In the 2022 direct-to-streaming Disney+ film &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, an arm from the 2003 Shredder appears as one of the components in Sweet Pete&#x27;s amalgamated form. Jim Cummings, who was an understudy for Shredder in the 1987 series, briefly reprised his role and provides Sweet Pete&#x27;s voice during his fight with Chip and Dale, credited as &quot;Shredder Arm&quot;.

<text>Father Divine (September 10, 1965), also known as Reverend M. J. Divine, was an American spiritual leader from about 1907 until his death in 1965. His full self-given name was Reverend Major Jealous Divine, and he was also known as &quot;the Messenger&quot; early in his life. He founded the International Peace Mission movement, formed its doctrine and oversaw its growth from a small and predominantly black congregation into a multiracial and international church. Many consider him to be a cult leader since he claimed to be God.

==Life and career==

===Prior to 1912: Early life and original name===
Little is known about Father Divine&#x27;s early life, or even his real given name. Father Divine and the peace movement he started did not keep many records. Father Divine declined several offers to write his biography, saying that &quot;the history of God would not be useful in mortal terms&quot;. He also refused to acknowledge his relationship with any family. Newspapers in the 1930s had to dig up his probable given name: George Baker. This name is not recognized by the Library of Congress, and from 1979, there is no further use of that name as a heading for Father Divine in libraries&#x27; catalogs.

Federal Bureau of Investigation files record his name as George Baker alias &quot;God&quot;. In 1936 Eliza Mayfield claimed to be Father Divine&#x27;s mother. She stated that his real name was Frederick Edwards from Hendersonville, North Carolina, and he had abandoned a wife and five children, but Mayfield offered no proof and claimed not to remember his father&#x27;s name. Father Divine replied that &quot;God has no mother.&quot;

Father Divine&#x27;s childhood remains a contentious point. Some, especially earlier researchers, suppose that he was born in the Deep South, most likely in Georgia, as the son of sharecroppers. Newer research by Jill Watts, based on census data, finds evidence for a George Baker Jr. of appropriate age born in an African-American enclave of Rockville, Maryland, called Monkey Run. If this theory is correct, his mother was a former slave named Nancy Baker, who died in May 1897.

Most researchers agree that Father Divine&#x27;s parents were freed black slaves. Notoriously poor records were kept about this generation of African Americans, so controversy about his upbringing is not likely to be resolved. On the other hand, he and his first wife, Peninniah (variant spellings: Penninah, Peninnah, Penniah) claimed that they were married on June 6, 1882. This date appears to have a spiritual meaning rather than a literal one.

Father Divine was probably called George Baker around the turn of the century. He worked as a gardener in Baltimore, Maryland. In a 1906 trip to California, Father Divine became acquainted with the ideas of Charles Fillmore and the New Thought movement, a philosophy of positive thinking that would inform his later doctrines. Among other things, this belief system asserted that negative thoughts led to poverty and unhappiness. Songwriter Johnny Mercer credited a Father Divine sermon for inspiring the title of his song &quot;Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive&quot;.

Father Divine attended a local Baptist Church, often preaching, until 1907, when a traveling preacher named Samuel Morris spoke and was expelled from the congregation. Morris, originally from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, had a soft-spoken and uncontroversial sermon until the end, when he raised his arms and shouted &quot;I am the Eternal Father!&quot; This routine had him thrown out of many churches in Baltimore, and was apparently unsuccessful until Morris happened upon the receptive Father Divine.

In his late 20s, Father Divine became Morris&#x27;s first follower and adopted a pseudonym, &quot;The Messenger&quot;. The Messenger was a Christ figure to Morris&#x27;s God the Father. Father Divine preached with Morris in Baltimore out of the home of former evangelist Harriette Snowden, who came to accept their divinity. Morris began calling himself &quot;Father Jehovia&quot;.

Divine and Father Jehovia were later joined by John A. Hickerson, who called himself Reverend Bishop Saint John the Vine. John the Vine shared the Messenger&#x27;s excellent speaking ability and his interest in New Thought.

In 1912, the three-man ministry collapsed, as John the Vine denied Father Jehovia&#x27;s monopoly on godhood, citing 1 John 4:15 to mean God was in everyone:

Father Divine parted ways with his former associates. Denying that Father Jehovia was God, and saying that not everyone could be God, he declared that he himself was God, and the only true expression of God&#x27;s spirit.

===1912–14: In the South===
Father Divine traveled south, where he preached extensively in Georgia. In 1913, conflicts with local ministers led to him being sentenced to 60 days in a chain gang. While he was serving his sentence, several prison inspectors were injured in an auto accident, which he viewed as the direct result of their disbelief.

Upon his release, he attracted a following of mostly black women in Valdosta, Georgia. He taught celibacy and the rejection of gender categorizations.

On February 6, 1914, several followers&#x27; husbands and local preachers had Divine arrested for lunacy. This arrest expanded his ministry, with reporters and worshipers deluging his prison cell. Some whites even began calling on him.

Former Mercer University professor and lay preacher, J.R. Moseley of Macon, Georgia befriended Divine and arranged for J.B. Copeland, a Mercer alum and respected Valdosta lawyer, to represent him pro bono. Moseley was interested in what he termed &quot;this unusual man&quot; in his autobiography &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;.

Decades later, in the 1930s, Moseley met Divine in New York City when he received word that the man going by that name might in fact be the same person he met in Georgia. Father Divine was found mentally sound in spite of &quot;maniacal&quot; beliefs. He had given no name when arrested and was tried as &quot;John Doe (alias God)&quot;.

===1914–1919: Brooklyn and marriage to Peninniah===
In 1914, Father Divine travelled to Brooklyn, New York, with a small number of followers and an all-black congregation. Although he claimed to be God incarnate fulfilling biblical prophecies, he lived relatively quietly.

He and his disciples formed a commune in a black, middle-class apartment building. He forbade sex, alcohol, tobacco and gambling among the people living with him. By 1919, he had adopted the name Reverend Major Jealous Divine. &quot;Reverend Major&quot; was chosen as a title of respect and authority, while &quot;Jealous&quot; was a reference to Exodus 34:14, where the Lord says he is a &quot;jealous god&quot; and that God&#x27;s name is Jealous. His followers affectionately called him Father Divine.

In this period, Father Divine was married to Peninniah (biblical name and the name of Peninnah, first wife of Elkanah the father of the prophet Samuel with variant spellings: Penninah, Peninnah, Penniah), a follower, who was many years older than himself. Like Father Divine, her early life is obscure, but she is believed to be from Macon, Georgia. Harris, who wrote a biography about the Peace movement and its leader said that Father Divine had met Peninah in Georgia and came North with her and that they bought the house in Sayville as a married couple. Penniniah would later claim that Father Divine had healed her from crippling arthritis or rheumatism and after this she became one of his early followers. She would also witness in churches and in the street about her miraculous recovery. According to this account Penniniah was a member of a Methodist church in Valdosta led by Rev. Joseph Gabriel, who had allowed Father Divine to preach in his church after witnessing one of his alleged miracles.

But in an interview with a reporter from the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Penniniah told a reporter that she had met Father Divine in Baltimore, Maryland, when he was a &#x27;Nazarene&#x27; or Holiness preacher. The actual marriage date is unknown but probably occurred between 1914 and 1917. She was first called &quot;Sister Penny&quot; then &quot;Mother Penny&quot; and finally referred to as &quot;Mother Divine&quot; or &quot;Mother of the Faithful&quot;.

In addition to lending her dignified look to Father Divine, Peninniah served to defuse rumours of impropriety between him and his many young female followers. Both Penninah and Father Divine would assert that the marriage was never physically consummated.

Peninniah became known for her free dinners, the forerunners of the later lavish &quot;Holy Communion&quot; banquets that helped to attract new followers to the movement. She also played a major part in the Peace Mission&#x27;s development throughout the 1920s and 1930s, establishing the group&#x27;s &quot;Promised Land&quot; in Ulster County in upstate New York, where she also attempted to open an orphanage (though the attempt was ultimately unsuccessful).

===1919–1931: Sayville, New York===

Father Divine and his disciples moved to Sayville, New York in 1919. He and his followers were the first black homeowners in town. Father Divine purchased his 72 Macon Avenue house from a resident who wanted to spite the neighbor he was feuding with. The two neighbors, both German Americans, began fighting when one of them changed his name from Felgenhauer to Fellows in response to anti-German sentiment. His neighbor taunted him, and the feud escalated until Fellows decided to move. As a final insult, he specifically advertised his home for sale to a &quot;colored&quot; buyer, presumably to lower his neighbors&#x27; property value.

In this period, his movement underwent sustained growth. Father Divine held free weekly banquets and helped newcomers find jobs. He began attracting many white followers as well as black. The integrated environment of Father Divine&#x27;s communal house and the apparent flaunting of his wealth by his owning a Cadillac infuriated neighbors.

Members of the overwhelmingly white community accused him of maintaining a large harem and engaging in scandalous sex, but the district attorney&#x27;s office in Suffolk County found the claims baseless. To try to please his neighbors, he had a sign posted at his driveway warning guests: NOTICE—Smoking—Intoxicating Liquors—Profane Language—Strictly Prohibited. Contrary to the charges of Sayville residents, Angels claimed that Father Divine prohibited singing after 8 p.m., and by 10 p.m. had closed all windows and blinds.&quot; Nonetheless, the neighbors continued to complain.
===1931–1932: Sayville arrests, trial, notoriety, and prison===
On May 8, 1931, a Sayville deputy arrested and charged Father Divine with disturbing the peace. Remarkably, during the Depression, Father Divine submitted his $1,000 bail in cash. The trial, not as speedy as the neighbors wanted, was scheduled for late fall, allowing Father Divine&#x27;s popularity to snowball for the entire Sayville vacation season.

Father Divine held banquets for as many as 3,000 people that summer. Cars clogging the streets for these gatherings bolstered some neighbors&#x27; claims that Father Divine was a disturbance to the peace and was hurting their property values.

On Sunday, November 15, at 12:15 am, a police officer was called to Father Divine&#x27;s for raucous loudness at his property. By the time state troopers, deputies and prison buses were called in, a mob of neighbors had surrounded the compound. Fearing a riot, the police informed Father Divine and his followers that they had fifteen minutes to disperse. Father Divine had them wait in silence for ten minutes, and then they filed into police custody.

Processed by the county jail at 3 am, clerks were frustrated, because his followers often refused to give their usual names and stubbornly offered the &quot;inspired&quot; names they adopted in the movement. Seventy-eight people were arrested altogether, including fifteen whites. Forty-six pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace and incurred $5 fines, which Father Divine paid with a $500 bill, which the court was embarrassingly unable to make change from. Penninah, Father Divine, and 30 followers resisted the charges.

Father Divine&#x27;s arrest and heterodox doctrines were sensationally reported. The New York frenzy made this event and its repercussions the single most famous moment of Father Divine&#x27;s life. Although mostly inaccurate, articles on Father Divine propelled his popularity. By December, his followers began renting buildings in New York City for Father Divine to speak in. Soon, he often had several engagements on a single night. On December 20, he spoke to an estimated 10,000 in Harlem&#x27;s Rockland Palace, a spacious former basketball venue, Manhattan Casino.

By May 1932, meetings were regularly held at the Rockland Palace and throughout New York and New Jersey. Father Divine had supporters in Washington, California and throughout the world thanks to New Thought devotees like Eugene Del Mar, an early convert and former Harlem journalist, and Henry Joerns, the publisher of New Thought Magazine in Seattle. Although the movement was predominantly black, followers outside the Northeastern United States were mostly middle-class whites.

In this period of expansions, several branch communes were opened in New York and New Jersey. Father Divine&#x27;s followers finally named the movement the International Peace Mission movement.

Father Divine&#x27;s trial was held on May 24, 1932. His lawyer, Ellee J. Lovelace, a prominent Harlem African American and former US attorney had requested the trial be moved outside of Suffolk County due to potential jury bias. The court acquiesced, and the trial took place at the Nassau County Supreme Court before Judge Lewis J. Smith. After a long trial, with many witnesses, &quot;Smith instructed the jury to ignore the statements made by witnesses not present on the night of the raid. Smith&#x27;s order invalidated most of the testimony in Father Divine&#x27;s favor and severely crippled the defense.&quot;

The jury found him guilty on June 5th but asked for leniency on behalf of Father Divine. Ignoring the jury&#x27;s request, Smith lectured on how Father Divine was a fraud and &quot;menace to society&quot; before issuing the maximum sentence for disturbing the peace: one year in prison and a $500 fine.

Smith, 55, died of a heart attack days later on June 9, 1932. Father Divine was widely reported to have commented on the death, &quot;I hated to do it.&quot; He wrote to his followers, &quot;I did not desire Judge Smith to die. ... I did desire that MY spirit would touch his heart and change his mind that he might repent and believe and be saved from the grave.&quot;

The impression that Judge Smith&#x27;s death was divine retribution was perpetuated by the press, which failed to report Smith&#x27;s prior heart problems and implied the death to be more sudden and unexpected than it was.

During his brief prison stay, Father Divine read prodigiously, notably on the Scottsboro Nine. After his attorneys secured release through an appeal on June 25, 1932, he declared that the foundational documents of the United States of America, such as the United States Constitution and Declaration of Independence, were inspired. Father Divine also taught that contemporary leaders strayed from these ideals, but he would become increasingly patriotic through his life.

===1932–1942: Harlem===

Father Divine moved to the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, where he had accumulated a significant following in the black community. Members, rather than Father Divine himself, held most deeds for the movement, but they contributed toward Father Divine&#x27;s comfortable lifestyle. Purchasing several hotels, which they called &quot;Heavens&quot;, members could live and seek jobs inexpensively. He opened one hotel &quot;near Atlantic City, New Jersey, so that blacks could access the beach.&quot;

Father Divine and the Peace Mission, became the largest property owners in Harlem at one point in time. The movement also opened several budget enterprises, including restaurants and clothing shops, that sold cheaply by cutting overheads. These proved very successful in the depression. Economical, cash-only businesses were part of Father Divine&#x27;s doctrine.

By 1934, branches had opened in Los Angeles and Seattle, and gatherings occurred in France, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia, but the membership totals were drastically overstated in the press. &quot;Time&quot; magazine estimated nearly 2 million followers, but the true figure of adherents was probably a few tens of thousands and a larger body of sympathizers who attended his gatherings.

Nonetheless, Father Divine was increasingly called upon to offer political endorsements, which he initially did give. For example, New York City mayoral candidates John P. O&#x27;Brien and Fiorello H. LaGuardia each sought his endorsement in 1933, but Father Divine was apparently uninterested.

An odd alliance between Father Divine and the Communist Party of America began in early 1934. Although Father Divine was an outspoken capitalist, he was impressed with the party&#x27;s commitment to civil rights. The party relished the endorsement, but contemporary FBI records indicate some critics of the perceived huckster were expelled from the party for protesting the alliance.

In spite of this alliance, the movement was largely apolitical until the Harlem Riot of 1935. Based on a rumor of police killing a black teenager, it left four dead and caused over $1 million in property damage in Father Divine&#x27;s neighborhood. Father Divine&#x27;s outrage at this and other racial injustices fueled a keener interest in politics. In January 1939, the movement organized the first-ever &quot;Divine Righteous Government Convention&quot;, which crafted political platforms incorporating the Doctrine of Father Divine. Among other things, the delegates opposed school segregation and many of Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s social programs, which they interpreted as &quot;handouts&quot;.

Later in May 1937, an ex-follower called Verinda Brown filed a lawsuit for $4,476 ($ in ) against Father Divine. The Browns had entrusted their savings with Father Divine in Sayville back in 1931. They left the movement in 1935, wishing to live as husband and wife again, but were unable to get their money back. In light of their evidence and testimony from Faithful Mary and others critical of the movement, the court ordered repayment of the money. However, this opened up an enormous potential liability from all ex-devotees, so Father Divine resisted and appealed the judgment.

Father Divine&#x27;s political focus on anti-lynching measures became more resolved. By 1940, his followers had gathered 250,000 signatures in favor of an anti-lynching bill he wrote. However, passage of such statutes came slowly in New York and elsewhere.

The Verinda Brown lawsuit against Father Devine dragged on and was sustained on appeal. In July 1942, he was ordered to pay Brown or face contempt of court. Instead, Father Divine fled the state and re-established his headquarters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He still visited New York, however. State law forbade serving subpoenas in New York on Sunday, so he often spoke on the Sabbath day in Harlem, the Promised Land (his commune in Kingston, New York), and Sayville, New York.

===1942–1965: Pennsylvania===
After moving to Philadelphia, Father Divine&#x27;s wife Penninah died. The exact date is not known, because Father Divine never talked about it or even acknowledged her death. However, it occurred sometime in 1943, as her last known appearance was at a banquet in New York in 1942 and biographers believe Penninah&#x27;s death rattled Father Divine, making him aware of his own mortality. It became obvious to Father Divine and his followers that his doctrine might not make one immortal as he asserted, at least not in the flesh.

In 1944, singer/songwriter Johnny Mercer came to hear of one of Divine&#x27;s sermons. The subject was &quot;You got to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative&quot;. Mercer said, &quot;Wow, that&#x27;s a colorful phrase!&quot; On his return to Hollywood, he got together with songwriter Harold Arlen (&quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;), and together they wrote &quot;Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive&quot;, which was recorded by Mercer and the Pied Pipers in 1945. It was recorded by Bing Crosby with the Andrews Sisters that same year.

After his first wife died, Father Divine married a white Canadian woman named Edna Rose Ritchings in Washington, D.C. on April 29, 1946. The ceremony was kept secret even from most members until Ritching&#x27;s visa expired. Critics of the movement believed that Father Divine&#x27;s seemingly scandalous marriage to 21-year-old Ritchings would destroy the movement. Instead, most followers rejoiced, and the marriage date became a celebrated anniversary in the movement. To prove that he and Ritchings adhered to his doctrine on sexual abstinence, Father Divine assigned a black female follower to be her constant companion.

He claimed that Ritchings, later called &quot;Mother S. A. Divine&quot;, was the reincarnation of Penninah. Reincarnation was not previously part of Father Divine&#x27;s doctrine and did not become a fixture of his theology. Followers believed that Penninah was an exceptional case and viewed her &quot;return&quot; as a miracle.

Going into the 1950s, the press rarely covered Father Divine, and when it did, it was no longer as a menace, but as an amusing relic. For example, light-hearted stories ran when Father Divine announced Philadelphia was capital of the world and when he claimed to inspire invention of the hydrogen bomb. Father Divine&#x27;s predominantly lower-class following ebbed as the economy swelled.
In 1953, follower John Devoute gave Father Divine Woodmont, a 72-acre (0.3 km2) hilltop estate in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania. This French Gothic manor served as his home and primary site of his increasingly infrequent banquets until his death in 1965.

As his health declined, he continued to petition for civil rights. In 1951, he advocated reparations to be paid to the descendants of slaves. He also argued in favor of integrated neighborhoods. However, he did not participate in the burgeoning American civil rights movement because of his poor health and especially his dislike of the use of racial labels, denying he was black.

On September 10, 1965, Father Divine died of natural causes at his Woodmont estate. His widow and remaining followers insist his spirit is still alive and always refer to Father Divine in the present tense. Believers keep the furnishings of Father Divine&#x27;s personal rooms at Woodmont just as they were as a shrine to his life.

Father Divine&#x27;s widow Edna Rose Ritchings became the spiritual leader of the movement. In 1972, she fought an attempt by Jim Jones to take over the movement&#x27;s dwindling devotees. Jones based some of his doctrines on the International Peace Mission movement and claimed to be the reincarnation of Father Divine. Although a few members of the Mission joined the Peoples Temple after Jones made his play for leadership of the movement, the power push was, in terms of its ultimate objective, a failure.

That Jones was 34 years old at the time of Father Divine&#x27;s death made his claims of being a new incarnation rather hard to sustain – Jones claimed Divine&#x27;s spirit had entered his body upon the passing of the elder man – and Ritchings was left unimpressed by Jones&#x27; impassioned rhetoric. Jones&#x27; custom of tape-recording all his sermons was copied from Divine, who &quot;spoke&quot; to his followers via archived sermon tapes once ill health forced him to cease speaking at meetings.

==Physical characteristics and preaching style==
Father Divine was a slight, black man at a diminutive . Through most of his life, he maintained a fastidious appearance and a neat mustache that he kept well groomed, his hair was invariably neatly combed, and since his days in Sayville, New York, he almost always wore a suit in public.

Divine was said to be very charismatic. His sermons were emotionally moving and freely associated between topics. His speech was often peppered with words of his own invention like &quot;physicalating&quot; and &quot;tangiblated&quot;. An attendee at a Harlem &quot;kingdoms&quot; meeting in the 1930s recalled that he rhythmically intoned &quot;Tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions. Tens, hundreds, ... millions.&quot; Although this seemed nonsense to the visitor, he reported that at the end the true believers chanted, &quot;Yes, he&#x27;s God. Yes he&#x27;s God.&quot;

Father Divine ended every sermon or article with the following statement, &quot;Sincerely wishing that you and those with whom you are concerned might be even as I AM for I AM well, healthy, joyful, peaceful, lively, loving, successful, prosperous and happy in spirit, body and mind and in every organ, muscle, sinew, joint, limb, vein and bone and even in every atom, fibre and cell of MY bodily form.&quot;

Other eccentricities were drawn from his doctrine. For example, nearly every sermon began with the greeting and exhortation &quot;Peace!&quot; Father Divine believed that &quot;peace&quot; should replace &quot;hello&quot;.

==Doctrine==

Father Divine preached of his divinity even before he was known as &quot;Father Divine&quot; in the late 1910s. His doctrine taught that his life fulfilled all biblical prophecies about the second coming, regarding himself as Jesus Christ reborn. Father Divine also lectured that Christ existed in &quot;every joint&quot; of his follower&#x27;s bodies, and that he was &quot;God&#x27;s light&quot; incarnated in order to show people how to establish heaven on earth and to show them the way to eternal life. For example:

Father Divine and his followers capitalized pronouns referring to him, much like &quot;&quot; translated from the tetragrammaton is capitalized in the English Bible.

Father Divine was particularly concerned with the downtrodden of society, including but not limited to African Americans. He was opposed to people accepting welfare. He believed in capitalism, and &quot;In his opinion, capitalism was not at fault; the individual was to blame for the depression.&quot; He thought Americans could make it better if they had positive thoughts and channeled God&#x27;s spirit.

==Legacy==

===Civil rights===
Some biographers, such as Robert Weisbrot, speculate that Father Divine was a forerunner to the civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s, heavily influenced by his upbringing in the segregated South. Others, such as Jill Watts, reject not only this characterization, but also the theory that Father Divine grew up in the Deep South. Watts asserts that Rockville was less oppressive than the South or even Baltimore, Maryland, and believes his civil rights positions are unintelligible without evaluating them in the context of the Doctrine of Father Divine.

===Religious===
Edna Rose Ritchings (Mother Divine) conducted services for the old and dwindling congregation until her death. The movement owns several properties, such as Father Divine&#x27;s Gladwyne estate Woodmont, his former home in Sayville, New York, and the Circle Mission Church on Broad Street in Philadelphia, which also houses the movement&#x27;s library.

In 2004, &quot;Gastronomica&quot; published an article about Mother S.A. Divine and the movement&#x27;s feasts.

In 2000, the Divine Lorraine Hotel near Temple University on North Broad Street was sold by the international Peace Mission movement. It was a budget hotel with separate floors for men and women in accord with Father Divine&#x27;s teachings. The Divine Tracy Hotel in West Philadelphia was sold in 2006.

<text>(also known as ) is a form of traditional Japanese puppet theatre, founded in Osaka in the beginning of the 17th century, which is still performed in the modern day. Three kinds of performers take part in a performance: the or (puppeteers), the (chanters), and musicians. Occasionally other instruments such as drums will be used.
The combination of chanting and playing is called and the Japanese word for puppet (or dolls, generally) is . It is used in many plays.

==History==
&#x27;s history goes as far back as the 16th century, but the origins of its modern form can be traced to around the 1680s. It rose to popularity after the playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653–1724) began a collaboration with the chanter Takemoto Gidayu (1651–1714), who established the Takemoto puppet theater in Osaka in 1684.

Originally, the term referred only to the particular theater established in 1805 in Osaka, which was named the after the puppeteering ensemble of , an early 18th-century puppeteer from Awaji, whose efforts revived the flagging fortunes of the traditional puppet theatre.

The puppets of the Osaka tradition tend to be somewhat smaller overall, while the puppets in the Awaji tradition are some of the largest as productions in that region tend to be held outdoors.

The heads and hands of traditional puppets are carved by specialists, while the bodies and costumes are often constructed by puppeteers. The heads can be quite mechanically sophisticated; in plays with supernatural themes, a puppet may be constructed so that its face can quickly transform into that of a demon. Less complex heads may have eyes that move up and down, side to side or close, and noses, mouths, and eyebrows that move.

Controls for all movements of parts of the head are located on a handle that extends down from the neck of the puppet, and are reached by the main puppeteer inserting their left hand into the chest of the puppet through a hole in the back of the torso.

The main puppeteer, the , uses their right hand to control the right hand of the puppet, and uses their left hand to control the puppet&#x27;s head. The left puppeteer, known as the or , depending on the tradition of the troupe, manipulates the left hand of the puppet with their own right hand by means of a control rod that extends back from the elbow of the puppet. A third puppeteer, the , operates the feet and legs. Puppeteers begin their training by operating the feet, then move on to the left hand, before being able to train as the main puppeteer. Many practitioners in the traditional puppetry world, particularly those in the National Theater, describe the long training period, which often requires ten years on the feet, ten years on the left hand, and ten years on the head of secondary characters before finally developing the requisite skills to move to the manipulation of the head of a main character, as an artistic necessity. However, in a culture like that of Japan, which privileges seniority, the system can also be considered a mechanism to manage competition among artistic egos and provide for a balance among the demographics of the puppeteers in a troupe in order to fill each role.

All but the most minor characters require three puppeteers, who perform in full view of the audience, generally wearing black robes. In most traditions, all puppeteers also wear black hoods over their heads, but a few others, including the National Bunraku Theater, leave the main puppeteer unhooded, a style of performance known as . The shape of the puppeteers&#x27; hoods also varies, depending on the school to which the puppeteer belongs.

Usually a single chanter recites all the characters&#x27; parts, altering his vocal pitch and style in order to portray the various characters in a scene. Occasionally multiple chanters are used. The chanters sit next to the player. Some traditional puppet theaters have a revolving platform for the chanter and player, which rotates to bring replacement musicians in for the next scene.

 is an author&#x27;s theater, as opposed to kabuki, which is a performer&#x27;s theater. In , prior to the performance, the chanter holds up the text and bows before it, promising to follow it faithfully. In kabuki, actors insert puns on their names, ad-libs, references to contemporary happenings and other things which deviate from the script.

The most famous playwright was Chikamatsu Monzaemon. With more than 100 plays to his credit, he is sometimes called the Shakespeare of Japan.

==Today==

Osaka is the home of the government-supported troupe at National Bunraku Theatre. The theater offers five or more shows every year, each running for two to three weeks in Osaka before moving to Tokyo for a run at the National Theater. The National Bunraku Theatre also tours within Japan and occasionally abroad.

Until the late 1800s there were also hundreds of other professional, semi-professional, and amateur troupes across Japan that performed traditional puppet drama.

Since the end of World War II, the number of troupes has dropped to fewer than 40, most of which perform only once or twice a year, often in conjunction with local festivals. A few regional troupes, however, continue to perform actively.

The Awaji Puppet Troupe, located on Awaji Island southwest of Kobe, offers short daily performances and more extensive shows at its own theater and has toured the United States, Russia and elsewhere abroad.

The of Shiga Prefecture, founded in the 1830s, has toured the United States and Australia on five occasions and has been active in hosting academic programs in Japan for American university students who wish to train in traditional Japanese puppetry.

The Imada Puppet Troupe, which has performed in France, Taiwan, and the United States, as well as the Kuroda Puppet Troupe are located in the city of Iida, in Nagano Prefecture. Both troupes, which trace their histories back more than 300 years, perform frequently and are also active in nurturing a new generation of traditional puppeteers and expanding knowledge of puppetry through training programs at local middle schools and by teaching American university students in summer academic programs at their home theaters.

The increase in interest in puppetry has contributed to the establishment of the first traditional Japanese puppet troupe in North America. Since 2003, the Bunraku Bay Puppet Troupe, based at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, has performed at venues around the United States, including the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the Smithsonian Institution, as well as in Japan. They have also performed alongside the Imada Puppet Troupe. The Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, Georgia, has an extensive variety of puppets in its Asian collection.

== Music and song ==

The chanter/singer () and the player provide the essential music of the traditional Japanese puppet theater. In most performances only a player and a chanter perform the music for an act. Harmony between these two musicians determines the quality of their contribution to the performance.

The role of the is to express the emotions and the personality of the puppets. The performs not only the voice of each of the characters, but also serves as the narrator of the play.

Located to the side of the stage the physically demonstrates facial expressions of each character while performing their respective voices. While performing multiple characters simultaneously the facilitates the distinction between characters by exaggerating their emotions and voices. This is also done to maximize the emotional aspects for the audience.

In the which is the largest as well as that of the lowest register, is employed.

The instruments most frequently used are flutes, in particular the , the and various percussion instruments.

==Puppets==
=== The head of the Puppet===
The heads of the puppets () are divided into categories according to gender, social class and personality. Certain heads are created for specific roles, others can be employed for several different performances by changing the clothing and the paint. The heads are in effect repainted and prepared before each presentation.

There are approximately 80 types of puppet heads broadly classified, and the Digital Library of the Japan Arts Council (ja) lists 129 types of puppet heads. 

Some of these heads have special tricks on them, and by pulling the strings of these tricks, the expression of the puppet can be changed to show that the human has turned into a or an by activating the trick. For example, by pulling a string, the , a type of head, can instantly split a beautiful woman&#x27;s mouth open up to her ears and grow fangs, her eyes change to a large golden color and she grows golden horns. It is possible to represent the transformation of a woman into in a single head. The head of , by pulling a string, can instantly cover the face of a beautiful woman with a mask. It is possible to represent, with a single head, the true appearance of the nine-tailed fox that was disguised as Tamamo-no-Mae. Note that in Noh, the change in the attributes of the characters is represented by removing one of the double-layered Noh masks. The , a type of head, can be made by pulling a string to split the head in two, revealing a red section to represent a head severed by a sword.

The preparation of the hair constitutes an art in and of itself. The hair distinguishes the character and can also indicate certain personality traits. The hair is made from human hair, however yak tail can be added to create volume. The ensemble is then fixed on a copper plate. To ensure that the puppet head is not damaged, the finishing of the hairstyle is made with water and beeswax, not oil.

=== Costumes ===
The costumes are designed by a costume master and are composed of a series of garments with varying colors and patterns. These garments typically include a sash and a collar as well as an underkimono (), a kimono, and a or an outer robe (). In order to keep the costumes soft they are lined with cotton.

As the clothing of the puppets wear out or are soiled the clothing is replaced by the puppeteers. The process of dressing or redressing the puppets by the puppeteers is called .

=== Construction ===
A puppet&#x27;s skeletal structure is simple. The carved wooden is attached to the head grip, or , and thrust down an opening out of the puppet&#x27;s shoulder. Long material is draped over the front and back of the shoulder board, followed by the attachment of cloth. Carved bamboo is attached to create the hips of the puppet, arms and legs are tied to the body with lengths of rope. There is no torso to the puppet, as it would merely block out the puppeteer&#x27;s range of movement of the individual limbs. The , or costume of the doll is then sewn on to cover over any cloth, wooden or bamboo parts that the artist does not wish to be seen. Finally, a slit is created in the back of the costume in order for the chief puppeteer to firmly handle the head stick.

== Text and the puppets ==
Unlike kabuki, which emphasizes the performance of the main actors, simultaneously demonstrates elements of presentation (directly attempting to invoke a certain response) and representation (trying to express the ideas or the feelings of the author). In this way attention is given to both visual and musical aspects of the puppets as well as the performance and the text. Every play begins with a short ritual in which the , kneeling behind a small but ornate lectern, reverentially lifts their copy of the script to demonstrate devotion to a faithful rendering of the text. The script is presented at the beginning of each act as well.

== Performers ==
Despite their complex training, the puppeteers originated from a very destitute background. The were itinerants and as a result were treated as outcasts by the educated, richer class of Japanese society at the time. As a form of entertainment, the men would operate small hand puppets and put on miniature theatre performances, while women were often skilled in dancing and magic tricks which they used to tempt travelers to spend the night with them. The whole environment that gave birth to these puppet shows is reflected in the themes.

==Stage==
===The musician&#x27;s stage ()===

The is the auxiliary stage upon which the is performed. It juts out into the audience area at the front right area of the seats. Upon this auxiliary stage there is a special rotating platform. It is here that the chanter and the player make their appearance, and, when they are finished, it turns once more, bringing them backstage and placing the next performers on the stage.

===The partitions () and the pit ()===

In the area between upstage and downstage, there are three stage positions, known as &quot;railings&quot; (). Located in the area behind the second partition is often called the pit and it is where the puppeteers stand in order to carry out the puppets&#x27; lifelike movements.

===Small curtain () and screened-off rooms ()===

This stage looks from an angle of the audience, the right side is referred to as the (stage left), while the left side is referred to as the (stage right). The puppets are made to appear and then leave the stage through the small black curtains. The blinded screens are just above these small curtains, and they have special blinds made from bamboo so that the audience cannot see inside.

=== Large curtain () ===
The is a large, low hanging curtain hanging off of a ledge called the . It is used to separate the area where the audience is sitting from the main stage. The puppeteers stood behind the , holding their puppets above the curtain while being hidden from the audience. However, the practice established later in the form would let the actors be seen on stage moving with the puppets, nulling the use of the curtains.

<text>Twin Cities Public Television, Inc. (abbreviated TPT, doing business as Twin Cities PBS) is a nonprofit organization based in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, that operates the Twin Cities&#x27; two PBS member television stations, KTCA-TV (channel 2.1) and KTCI-TV (channel 2.3), both licensed to Saint Paul. It produces programs for local, regional and national television broadcast, operates numerous websites, and produces rich media content for Web distribution.

TPT&#x27;s offices and studio facilities are on East 4th Street in downtown Saint Paul; KTCA-TV and KTCI-TV transmit from the KMSP Tower in Shoreview, Minnesota.

Twin Cities PBS also serves the Mankato market via K26CS-D (relaying KTCA) and K29IE-D (relaying KTCI) in nearby St. James through the local municipal-operated Cooperative TV (CTV) network of translators as that area does not have a PBS member station of its own.

==History==

Twin Cities Public Television was incorporated in 1955 as Twin City Area Educational Television.

KTCA (channel 2) began broadcasting as the first non-commercial public television station in the state on September 16, 1955, from a shabby, WWII wooden barracks-type structure on the University of Minnesota Agricultural Campus. The studios and offices were moved in the 1960s to what was known as the Minnesota Statehood Centennial Memorial Building for Education Television, at 1640 Como Avenue in Saint Paul. (Incidentally, that building housed another Twin Cities commercial television station, WUCW, channel 23, from 1989 to 2018.) KTCA&#x27;s first program was &quot;Exploring Science&quot;. A second station, KTCI (channel 17), was launched on May 4, 1965. Channel 17 was originally assigned to the Tedesco Brothers in the early 1950s to be a commercial station, WCOW-TV, affiliated with the DuMont Television Network, but that station never made it to air. In 1967, KTCA became the first educational television station in the United States to broadcast in color. In 1976, the station changed its corporate name to Twin Cities Public Television.

On September 16, 1999, the stations began their first digital television broadcasts, 10 years after moving to 172 4th Street East in downtown Saint Paul. In 2000, KTCA and KTCI were rebranded &quot;tpt2&quot; and &quot;tpt17&quot;, paving the way for the larger family of digital broadcast services to come. In 2002, TPT became the first broadcaster in Minnesota to launch a channel, &quot;tptHD&quot;, fully devoted to high-definition programming, and in 2004 the organization launched a full-time digital channel, &quot;tptMN&quot;, devoted entirely to local and regional programs.

In December 2005, the organization began distributing many of its productions online, making programs available through iTunes, Google Video, and Yahoo! Podcasts among others. Its website features streaming video as well as video podcasts. In 2007, TPT began offering Video-On-Demand (VOD) through local cable providers.

KTCA&#x27;s Nielsen ratings are among the highest of any PBS station in the country.

During the summer of 2015, a new name and logo, &quot;Twin Cities PBS&quot;, was introduced, before debuting on air on September 30, 2015. The rebrand included an updated version of the TPT logo that had been used since 2000, by Minnesota design agency Capsule.

==The Minnesota Channel==
The Minnesota Channel (TPT MN) is a full-time statewide network originating at Twin Cities Public Television and carried on digital subchannels of nine stations. It features programming related to Minnesota and Wisconsin, including ethnic and public-affairs programming.

In 2002, TPT began setting aside time on KTCI for the &quot;Minnesota Channel&quot;, an evening dedicated to local and regional related programming, which expanded to a full-time digital subchannel on September 16, 2004. The Minnesota Channel was expanded region-wide in Minnesota and North Dakota in February 2007.

==Technical information==


KTCA-DT and KTCI-DT began broadcasting on channels 34 and 16 respectively on September 16, 1999.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
TPT rearranged its on-air lineup on February 18, 2009. It continued to use both KTCA-DT and KTCI-DT&#x27;s transmitter, but shut down the separate tpt17 service and unified all over-the-air channels as virtual subchannels of 2. TPT&#x27;s stations shut down their analog signals at 9 a.m. on June 12, 2009, the date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts by federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital channel allocations post-transition are as follows:
* KTCA-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 34, using virtual channel 2.1.
* KTCI-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 17; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 16, using virtual channel 2.3.

The then-new channel lineup was originally meant to coincide with the DTV transition. When the transition&#x27;s mandatory cutoff was delayed, TPT announced the new lineup would still go forward and it would continue its analog service until the new cutoff. Until then, KTCA-TV simulcast tpt 2 and KTCI-TV simulcast tptLife on their analog signals.

<doc id="647454" wikidata="Q16147465" url="?curid=647454" title="Negro World Series">
<text>The Negro World Series was a post-season baseball tournament that was held from 1924 to 1927 and from 1942 to 1948 between the champions of the Negro leagues, matching the mid-western winners against their east-coast counterparts. The series was also known as the Colored World Series, especially during the 1920s, and as the Negro League World Series, in more recent books, though contemporary black newspapers usually called it simply, the &quot;World Series&quot;, without any modification. A total of eleven Series were contested in its prime, which ultimately saw nine teams compete for a championship and seven who won at least one. The Homestead Grays were the winningest and most present team in the tournament, winning three times in five appearances, while Dave Malarcher and Candy Jim Taylor won the most titles as manager with two each.

==History==
===Colored World Series era===

After the organization of the first Negro National League (NNL) in 1920 and of the Eastern Colored League (ECL) in 1923, many Negro league fans hoped that the two leagues would compete in a post-season championship similar to the World Series held by the white leagues. On September 2, 1924, Rube Foster, the president of the NNL, announced that Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Commissioner of Baseball for the white major leagues, had been asked to arbitrate the differences between the NNL and ECL and establish an agreement similar to the one used by the American and National Leagues. The proposed agreement required the two leagues to respect each other&#x27;s contracts, made allowances for players who had jumped contracts to stay with their current teams, and for a post-season championship between the leagues. The first game of the championship series opened at Philadelphia on October 3, 1924, between the Kansas City Monarchs of the NNL and the Hilldale Club of the ECL; the final game was played at Chicago on October 20, with the Monarchs emerging as the series winner. In 1928, the ECL folded, with their teams returning to independent play, and the series entered a 15-year hiatus. The first NNL also folded after the 1931 season.

===Negro World Series era===
A second Negro National League was organized in 1933, though this league played predominantly in the East. The Negro American League was organized in 1937 in the West. In 1942, the two leagues agreed to resume playing a championship series between the two leagues; the first series was played between the Kansas City Monarchs of the NAL and the Homestead Grays of the NNL. Segregated baseball suffered a collapse after the integration of Major League Baseball in 1947 with the arrival of Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby, as several players would later defect onto MLB and other various leagues. By 1949, the Negro leagues were essentially considered a minor league circuit, particularly with the demise of the Negro National League. Black baseball continued on anyway, albeit with dwindling crowds and quality in pursuit of money that awarded a champion until 1957, albeit without a Series to determine a champion, but with record (the East–West All-Star Game, which played from 1933 to 1962, was generally considered a surrogate championship game by the press); as barnstorming units, teams came and went, but most stopped playing after the demise of the NAL in 1962 (with the exception of the Indianapolis Clowns, who barnstormed until 1989).

<doc id="647469" wikidata="Q3605945" url="?curid=647469" title="Aeolian-Skinner">
<text>Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company, Inc. of Boston, Massachusetts was an American builder of a large number of pipe organs from its inception as the Skinner Organ Company in 1901 until its closure in 1972. Key figures were Ernest M. Skinner (1866–1960), Arthur Hudson Marks (1875–1939), Joseph Silver Whiteford (1921-1978), and G. Donald Harrison (1889–1956). The company was formed from the merger of the Skinner Organ Company and the pipe organ division of the Aeolian Company in 1932.

==Skinner period==

The Skinner &amp; Cole Company was formed in 1902 as a partnership of Ernest Skinner and Cole, another former Hutchings-Votey employee. By 1904 the partnership had dissolved, and the &quot;Ernest M. Skinner &amp; Company&quot; purchased the Skinner and Cole assets, in the form of the contract for the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Holy Trinity in New York City from the former company for $1.

Between 1904 and 1910, the firm produced approximately 30 instruments, including several new instruments of Skinner&#x27;s design, in the 60- to 80-stop size range.

By 1912 the firm had perfected the &quot;Pitman Windchest&quot; to a state of simple technical elegance. (A &quot;wind chest&quot; is the large box, normally built of wood, upon which the sound producing pipes are &quot;planted&quot;, and which contains the valves and mechanisms which control the wind supply to the pipes.) The Pitman chest allows the air to be held constantly pressurized, directly at the valves located beneath each of the thousands of pipes, which increases responsiveness to the player, and eliminates noise and other problems found with the &quot;Ventil&quot;-style chests, which apply wind only when a stop is drawn. Virtually all major builders of electro-pneumatic action organs, including M. P. Möller, W. W. Kimball (both firms now defunct), Schantz, and Reuter, use some form of the Pitman windchest to this day, although most have only recently begun to credit Skinner with the design and subsequent refinements that make it an industry benchmark.
Skinner also developed and perfected numerous parts of the &quot;actions&quot; for the instruments, as well as the Whiffletree Shade Motor, a mechanical device that moves the expression shades in a smooth, fluid motion without the &quot;slam&quot; that often accompanies mechanical expression shade controls. This allowed the instruments to provide quick and responsive control of the expression (volume) levels of the different parts of the instrument.

In 1914 the Skinner Organ Factory company moved into a new factory building in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston at Crescent Avenue and Sydney Street.

== Harrison period ==
G. Donald Harrison joined the Skinner firm in July 1927, and slowly began to influence how Skinner organs were built. After several years of conflict between Ernest Skinner and Arthur Marks, Harrison was appointed Vice-President and Tonal Director of Aeolian-Skinner in 1933. The company’s tonal philosophy continued to turn from the romantic-style orchestral instruments built under the direction of Skinner to a classically eclectic style. Organists began to look to the past to find direction for the future, and in doing so they found that they were in sympathy with the ideas being developed by Harrison. These ideas included the provision of smaller-scaled diapasons, along with more higher-pitched and mutation stops in place of large-scaled unison diapasons, color reeds and flutes.

During Harrison&#x27;s tenure from 1933 until his death in 1956 (while doing tonal finishing on the organ at St. Thomas Church, New York City, which was completed by Arthur Birchall after Harrison&#x27;s death), the tonal design of Aeolian-Skinner organs changed a great deal, but retained and perfected many of Ernest Skinner&#x27;s mechanical innovations. The company used Skinner&#x27;s Pitman windchest, for example, throughout its existence. Also the high quality and distinctive design details of the Aeolian-Skinner console were preserved.

Instruments built or rebuilt during the Harrison period include (date, consoles/ranks):

*Rochester, Minnesota: St Marys Hospital Chapel (1932)

== Whiteford period ==
After Harrison&#x27;s death in June 1956, former Vice President Joseph S. Whiteford was appointed President. Whiteford joined the company in 1948 and had distinguished himself through research in the field of musical acoustics as it relates to church music. Under his direction, Aeolian-Skinner built pipe organs for five of the foremost symphony orchestras in America. His love for vocal music led him to emphasize the role of the organ in accompanying singing. He had a charismatic personality that was well suited to the prestige of the Aeolian-Skinner name. In fact, his personal involvement secured major contracts that were directly commissioned without competing bids. His tonal work was not without criticism, including from within the company- e.g. Donald Gillett&#x27;s unhappiness with Whiteford&#x27;s &quot;string quartet Greats&quot;. For more information see Dr Charles Callahan&#x27;s book &quot;Aeolian-Skinner Remembered&quot;.

Instruments from the Whiteford period include:
*Detroit: Ford Auditorium (1957, III/71). Dismantled immediately prior to the auditorium being demolished in 2011. The organ will be installed in St. Aloysius Catholic Church in downtown Detroit.
*Westminster, Maryland: Baker Memorial Chapel (1958)
*Independence, Missouri: RLDS Auditorium (1959, IV/113)
*Honolulu: St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral (1960, IV/72)
*Ypsilanti, Michigan: Eastern Michigan University Pease Auditorium (1960). Still in full working order and used for regular performances .
*New York City: Church of the Epiphany (1962)
*Atlanta: Cathedral of St. Philip (1962, IV/98)
*New York City: Lincoln Center, Philharmonic Hall (1963, IV/98). Removed and incorporated into the Crystal Cathedral (Christ Cathedral) organ, Garden Grove, California.

After the Whiteford&#x27;s resignation in 1966, John J. Tyrell, Donald M. Gillett, and Robert L. Sipe served as president until the company ceased operations in 1972.

== Recordings made by Aeolian-Skinner ==

Beginning in 1954, Aeolian-Skinner produced a series of LP records titled &quot;The King of Instruments&quot;. These LPs are devoted to the tone and history of the modern organ. Volume 1, &quot;The American Classic Organ&quot;, contains a descriptive discussion written over both sides of the LP cover by Tyler Turner and Joseph Whiteford on the beginnings of the American classic organ. The five recorded sections on the record, with G. Donald Harrison as narrator describing the five selections, are &quot;I-Principals&quot;, &quot;II-Flutes&quot;, &quot;III-Strings&quot;, &quot;IV-Reeds&quot;, and &quot;V-Mixtures and Mutations&quot;. Organ demonstrations come from the Aeolian-Skinner organs of St. John the Divine, Symphony Hall, St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (Boston), and First Presbyterian Church, Kilgore, Texas.

<doc id="647470" wikidata="Q1052508" url="?curid=647470" title="Chebyshev nodes">
<text>In numerical analysis, Chebyshev nodes are a set of specific real algebraic numbers, used as nodes for polynomial interpolation. They are the projection of equispaced points on the unit circle onto the real interval formula_1 the diameter of the circle.

The &quot;Chebyshev nodes of the first kind&quot;, also called the Chebyshev zeros, are the zeros of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. The &quot;Chebyshev nodes of the second kind&quot;, also called the Chebyshev extrema, are the extrema of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, which are also the zeros of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. Both of these sets of numbers are commonly referred to as &quot;Chebyshev nodes&quot; in literature. Polynomial interpolants constructed from these nodes minimize the effect of Runge&#x27;s phenomenon.

==Definition==
For a given positive integer formula_2 the Chebyshev nodes of the first kind in the open interval formula_3 are
formula_4

These are the roots of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind with degree formula_2. For nodes over an arbitrary interval formula_6 an affine transformation can be used:
formula_7

Similarly, for a given positive integer formula_2 the Chebyshev nodes of the second kind in the closed interval formula_9 are
formula_10

These are the roots of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind with degree formula_2. For nodes over an arbitrary interval formula_12 an affine transformation can be used as above. The Chebyshev nodes of the second kind are also referred to as Chebyshev-Lobatto points or Chebyshev extreme points. Note that the Chebyshev nodes of the second kind include the end points of the interval while the Chebyshev nodes of the first kind do not include the end points. These formulas generate Chebyshev nodes which are sorted from greatest to least on the real interval.

Both kinds of nodes are always symmetric about the midpoint of the interval. Hence, for odd formula_2, both kinds of nodes will include the midpoint. Geometrically, for both kinds of nodes, we first place formula_2 points on the upper half of the unit circle with equal spacing between them. Then the points are projected down to the formula_15-axis. The projected points on the formula_15-axis are called Chebyshev nodes.

==Approximation==

The Chebyshev nodes are important in approximation theory because they form a particularly good set of nodes for polynomial interpolation. Given a function on the interval formula_17 and formula_2 points formula_19 in that interval, the interpolation polynomial is that unique polynomial formula_20 of degree at most formula_21 which has value formula_22 at each point formula_23. The interpolation error at formula_15 is
formula_25
for some formula_26 (depending on ) in . So it is logical to try to minimize
formula_27

This product is a &quot;monic&quot; polynomial of degree . It may be shown that the maximum absolute value (maximum norm) of any such polynomial is bounded from below by . This bound is attained by the scaled Chebyshev polynomials , which are also monic. (Recall that for .) Therefore, when the interpolation nodes are the roots of , the error satisfies
formula_28
For an arbitrary interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] a change of variable shows that
formula_29

== Even order modified Chebyshev nodes ==
Many applications for Chebyshev nodes, such as the design of equally terminated passive Chebyshev filters, cannot use Chebyshev nodes directly, due to the lack of a root at 0. However, the Chebyshev nodes may be modified into a usable form by translating the roots down such that the lowest roots are moved to zero, thereby creating two roots at zero of the modified Chebyshev nodes.

The even order modification translation is:

formula_30

The sign of the formula_31 function is chosen to be the same as the sign of formula_32.

For example, the Chebyshev nodes for a 4th order Chebyshev function are, {0.92388,0.382683,-0.382683,-0.92388}, and formula_33 is formula_34, or 0.146446. Running all the nodes through the translation yields formula_35 to be {0.910180, 0, 0, -0.910180}.

The modified even order Chebyshev nodes now contains two nodes of zero, and is suitable for use in designing even order Chebyshev filters with equally terminated passive element networks.

<doc id="647483" wikidata="Q777981" url="?curid=647483" title="Duchy of the Archipelago">
<text>The Duchy of the Archipelago (, , ), also known as Duchy of Naxos or Duchy of the Aegean, was a maritime state created by Venetian interests in the Cyclades archipelago in the Aegean Sea, in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, centered on the islands of Naxos and Paros. It included all the Cyclades (except Mykonos and Tinos). In 1537, it became a tributary of the Ottoman Empire, and was annexed by the Ottomans in 1579; however, Christian rule survived in islands such as Sifnos (conquered by the Ottomans in 1617) and Tinos (conquered in 1715).

==Background and establishment of the Duchy==
The Italian city-states, especially the Republic of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice, had been interested in the islands of the Aegean long before the Fourth Crusade. There were Italian trading colonies in Constantinople and Italian pirates frequently attacked settlements in the Aegean in the 12th century. After the collapse and partitioning of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, in which the Venetians played a major role, Venetian interests in the Aegean could be more thoroughly realized.

The Duchy of the Archipelago was created in 1207 by the Venetian nobleman Marco Sanudo, a participant in the Fourth Crusade and nephew of the former Doge Enrico Dandolo, who had led the Venetian fleet to Constantinople. This was an independent venture, without the consent of the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders. Sanudo was accompanied by Marino Dandolo and Andrea and Geremia Ghisi (as well as Filocalo Navigajoso, possibly). He arranged for the loan of eight galleys from the Venetian Arsenal, set anchor in the harbour of Potamides (port) (now Pyrgaki, in the southwest of Naxos), and largely captured the island.

The Naxiotes continued to resist, however, and established a base inland, around the fortress of Apalyros/Apalire. The latter fell to Sanudo after a five or six weeks&#x27; siege, despite the assistance rendered to the Greeks by the Genoese, Venice&#x27;s main competitors.

With the entire island occupied in 1210, Sanudo and his associates soon conquered Melos and the rest of the islands of the Cyclades, and he established himself as &quot;Duke of Naxia&quot;, or &quot;Duke of the Archipelago&quot;, with his headquarters on Naxos. Sanudo rebuilt a strong fortress and divided the island into 56 provinces, which he shared out as fiefs among the leaders of his men, most of whom were highly autonomous and paid their own expenses. Navigaojso had been granted his island domain by Henry of Flanders and was technically a vassal of the Latin Empire; Sanudo himself recognized the Latin Empire&#x27;s authority rather than making the Duchy a vassal of Venice. The conqueror himself ruled for twenty years (1207–27). He held in his personal possession Paros, Antiparos, Milos, Sifnos, Kythnos, Ios, Amorgos, Kimolos, Sikinos, Syros, and Pholegandros.

Sanudo&#x27;s fellow crusaders conquered lordships of their own, sometimes as vassals of Sanudo, e.g. Dandolo on Andros. Although they are often considered to have become Sanudo&#x27;s vassals as well, the Ghisi brothers, who held Tinos, Mykonos, and the Northern Sporades (Skiathos, Skyros, Skopelos) never recognized the suzerainty of Sanudo. Instead, like him, they were directly vassals of the Latin Emperors. Some families thought earlier to have settled at this time in the islands were in fact established later, in the 14th century (Barozzi etc.) or the 15th (Querini). Further south, Kythera (or &quot;Cerigo&quot;), held by Marco Venier, and Antikythera (or &quot;Cerigotto&quot;), held by Jacopo Viaro chose to become vassals of Venice.

==Administration, faith and economics==
The institution of European feudalism caused little disruption to the local islanders, who were familiar with the rights of a landowner class under the Byzantine system of the &quot;pronoia&quot;. The significant legal distinctions between the Byzantine &quot;pronoia&quot; and feudalism were of little immediate consequence for those who farmed the land or fished the waters in question. In most cases, the local population submitted relatively peacefully to the authority of their new Venetian lords. Sanudo and his successors prudently followed a conciliatory course with their Byzantine subjects, granting even fiefs to certain among them, in an effort to bind them to the dynasty.

The Venetians brought the Catholic Church with them, but, as they were a minority of habitually absentee landowners, most of the population remained Greek Orthodox. Marco Sanudo himself established a Latin archbishopric on Naxos, but in contrast to his successors, did not attempt to forcibly convert the Greek Orthodox majority. These moves consisted primarily of imposing restrictions on Orthodox clergy and the exclusion of Orthodox Christians from positions of authority.

The islands were of great importance in Venetian grand strategy, with their valuable trade routes to Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean, which the Venetians could now control. Aside from providing safe travelling routes to Venetian ships, the Venetians also exported corundum and marble, which they mined on Naxos, to Venice. Certain Latin feudal rights survived on the island of Naxos and elsewhere until they were abrogated in 1720 by the Ottomans.

==Later history==
The &quot;Annals&quot; of the Latin Archipelago center on the family histories of Sanudo and Dandolo, Ghisi, Crispo, Sommaripa, Venier and Quirini, Barozzi and Gozzadini. Twenty-one dukes of the two dynasties ruled the Archipelago, successively as vassals of the Latin Emperors at Constantinople, of the Villehardouin dynasty of princes of Achaea, of the Angevins of the Kingdom of Naples (in 1278), and after 1418 of the Republic of Venice.

In 1248, the Duchy was nominally granted to William of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea. Marco II Sanudo lost many of the islands, except Naxos and Paros, to the forces of the renewed Byzantine Empire under the admiral Licario in the late 13th century. The Byzantine revival was to prove short-lived, though, as they relinquished control of their gains in 1310.

In 1317 the Catalan Company raided the remnants of the Duchy; in 1383, the Crispo family led an armed insurrection and overthrew Sanudo&#x27;s heirs as Dukes of Archipelago. Under the Crispo dukes, social order and agriculture decayed, and piracy became dominant. It officially became a vassal of Venice in 1418 in reaction of the Rise of the Ottoman Empire.

==Collapse and Ottoman conquest==

Before the last Latin Christian duke, Jacopo IV Crispo, was deposed in 1566 by Ottoman Sultan Selim II, he was already paying the Sultan tribute. The Sultan&#x27;s appointed representative, the last Duke of Archipelago (1566–79) was a Portuguese Jew (Marrano), Joseph Nasi.

Latin Christian rule did not come to a complete end on that date: the Gozzadini family in Bologna survived as lords of Sifnos and other little islands in the Cyclades until 1617, and the island of Tinos remained Venetian until 1714. The last Venetian ports in Morea (the Peloponnese) were captured in 1718. Gaspar Graziani, a Dalmatian nobleman, was awarded the title of &quot;Duke of the Archipelago&quot; in 1616, but the island was again under direct Ottoman rule at the end of 1617; he was the last to hold the title.

==Legacy and influence==
Today, Cyclades islands such as Syros and Tinos have some entirely Catholic villages and parishes, while many Greeks from the Cyclades have surnames with a distinctly Italo-Venetian origin e.g. Venieris, Ragousis, Dellaportas, Damigos etc.

<text>In political contexts, comrade means a fellow party member, usually left-wing. The political use was inspired by the French Revolution, after which it grew into a form of address between socialists and workers. Since the Russian Revolution, popular culture in the West has often associated it with communism. As such, it can be used as a derogatory reference to left-wingers, akin to &quot;&quot;. In particular, the Russian word () may be used as derogatory reference to Communists.

==Etymology==
The term comrade generally means &#x27;mate&#x27;, &#x27;colleague&#x27;, or &#x27;ally&#x27;, and derives from the Spanish and Portuguese term , , from Latin , . It may also specifically mean &quot;fellow soldier&quot;, .

== Background ==
Upon abolishing the titles of nobility in France, and the terms and (literally, &#x27;my lord&#x27; and &#x27;my lady&#x27;), the revolutionaries employed the term for men and for women (both meaning &#x27;citizen&#x27;) to refer to each other. The deposed King Louis XVI, for instance, was referred to as to emphasize his loss of privilege.

When the socialist movement gained momentum in the mid-19th century, socialists elsewhere began to look for a similar egalitarian alternative to terms like &quot;Mister&quot;, &quot;Miss&quot;, or &quot;Missus&quot;. In German, the word had long been used as an affectionate form of address among people linked by some strong common interest, such as a sport, a college, a profession (notably as a soldier), or simply friendship. The term was often used with political overtones in the revolutions of 1848, and was subsequently borrowed by French and English. In English, the first known use of the word &quot;comrade&quot; with this meaning was in 1884 in the socialist magazine &quot;Justice&quot;.

==Political usage==
=== Russian and Soviet usage ===
In the late 19th century, Russian Marxists and other leftist revolutionaries adopted the word &quot;&quot; () as a translation for the German term . Originally, &quot;tovarisch&quot; meant &quot;business companion&quot; or &quot;travel (or other adventure) mate&quot; deriving from the Old Turkic ; abbreviated , and related to the noun (, meaning &#x27;merchandise&#x27;). In socialist and labour movements, it became a common form of address, as in or &#x27; &quot;Chairman&quot; or simply as &#x27; (especially German) social democracy. After the Russian Revolution, translations of &quot;tovarisch&quot; spread globally among communists, though the term &quot;comrade&quot; became closely associated with the Soviet Union specifically in the eyes of many.

With the February Revolution of 1917, traditional forms of address common in Tsarist Russia would become deeply unpopular and were replaced by the more republican and egalitarian title of citizen. However, this would be overshadowed by the address of comrade due to the more revolutionary connotations. The term &quot;citizen&quot; did not seem sufficiently pro-revolutionary as many monarchists identified themselves as &#x27;Russian citizens and loyal subjects of the sovereign-Emperor&#x27;. In contrast being called &quot;comrade&quot; implied a kind of revolutionary zeal and exceptionalism. Yet, it was widely used across society: socialists in the Provisional Government were known as &#x27;comrade ministers&#x27;, policemen and Cossacks were addressed as &#x27;comrades&#x27;, and even rural witch-doctors became &#x27;comrade spirits&#x27;.

During the revolutionary period, once the Bolsheviks had taken power, they continued to use &quot;comrade&quot; to address or refer to people presumed to be sympathetic to the revolution and to the Soviet state, such as workers, members of the Communist Party, and (for a time) Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. For everyone else, citizen was the preferred term; however, it could also serve as an insult, especially if the individual expected a more respectful address. For instance, the guards of Nicholas II deliberately called him &#x27;citizen Romanov&#x27; during his captivity. The anti-Bolshevik socialists, such as the Socialist Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, also addressed each other as &quot;comrade&quot;, while the Whites mockingly, referred to their enemies as &#x27;the comrades&#x27;. As discontent with the Bolshevik regime grew, even within the Soviet camp, comrade could be seen as an insult. in one instance, a woman on a Petrograd tram, when addressed as &quot;comrade&quot;, replied: &#x27;What&#x27;s all this &#x27;comrade&#x27; talk? Take your &#x27;comrade&#x27; and go to hell!&quot;.

By the mid-1920s, the address had become so widespread in the Soviet Union that it was used casually as titles like &quot;Mister&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot; in English. That use persisted until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Still, the original meaning partly re-surfaced in some contexts: criminals and suspects were only addressed as &quot;citizens&quot; and not as , and expressly refusing to address someone as would generally be perceived as a hostile act or, during the Stalin era, even as an accusation of being &quot;Anti-Soviet&quot;.

Currently, in the Russian Armed Forces, is used as a mandatory and statutory form of address, always to be used when military personnel address one another. Senior officers referring to subordinates must call them either by their military rank and last name, or only their military rank with being added before the rank. The reverse is also true, with subordinates referring to senior officers by military rank and the prefix of , though subordinates do not call their superiors by last name. One example is &quot;Comrade Senior Lieutenant&quot; (товарищ старший лейтенант). 

=== Chinese usage ===
In Chinese, the translation of &quot;comrade&quot; is (), literally meaning &#x27;(people with) the same spirit, goal, ambition, etc.&#x27;. It was first introduced in the political sense by Sun Yat-sen to refer to his followers. The (Nationalist Party), which was co-founded by Sun Yat-Sen, has a long tradition of using this term to refer to its members, usually as a noun rather than a title; for example, a KMT member would say &quot;Mr. Chang is a loyal and reliable comrade ().&quot;

Nevertheless, the term was promoted most actively by the Chinese Communist Party during its struggle for power. It was used both as a noun and as a title for basically anyone in mainland China after the People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded. For example, women were (&#x27;female comrade&#x27;), children were (&#x27;little comrade&#x27;) and seniors were (&#x27;old comrade&#x27;). However, after the 1980s and the onset of China&#x27;s market-oriented reforms, this term has been moving out of such daily usage. It remains in use as a respectful term of public address among middle-aged Chinese and members of the Chinese Communist Party. Within the Communist Party, failure to address a fellow member as is seen as a subtle but unmistakable sign of disrespect and enmity.

At party or civil meetings, the usage of the term has been retained. Officials often address each other as , and thus the usage here is not limited to Communist Party members alone. In addition, is the term of preference to address any national leader when their titles are not attached (e.g., &quot;Comrade&quot; Mao Zedong, &quot;Comrade&quot; Deng Xiaoping).

In October 2016, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a directive urging all 90 million party members to keep calling each other &quot;comrades&quot; instead of less egalitarian terms. It is also in the regulations of the Chinese Armed Forces as one of three appropriate ways to formally address another member of the military (&quot;comrade&quot; plus rank or position, as in &quot;Comrade Colonel&quot;, or simply &quot;comrade/s&quot; when lacking information about the person&#x27;s rank, or talking to several servicepeople.)

The SAR territories of Hong Kong and Macau generally use as a catch-all term to refer to members of the LGBT community; its use as a word for &quot;comrade&quot; has historically been uncommon due to both territories formerly being under foreign administrations. This definition of is becoming increasingly popular among mainland Chinese youth and a growing number of older Chinese people have stopped using due to its new association with the LGBT community.

=== South African usage ===

During the 1970s and 1980s, &quot;comrade&quot; emerged as a popular revolutionary form of address in South Africa among those involved in anti-apartheid political activities. For example, members of the African National Congress and South African Communist Party frequently referred to each other as &quot;comrade&quot;.

Among poor residents of the country&#x27;s segregated townships, it was also used to specifically denote members of militant youth organisations. These radical activists led consumer boycotts, organised anti-apartheid rallies and demonstrations, and intimidated those suspected of having ties to the South African government or security forces. In this particular context, the English title &quot;comrades&quot; was also used interchangeably with the Xhosa term .

=== Zimbabwean usage ===

In Zimbabwe, the term is used for persons affiliated with the ZANU–PF political party. The state media also use &quot;Cde&quot; as short for &quot;comrade&quot;. Members of other political parties mainly the Movement for Democratic Change are often referred by their names or Mr, Mrs or Prof.

The revived Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU) members also call themselves comrades.

=== South Sudanese usage ===
Members of the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army call each other &#x27;Comrade&#x27;.

=== British usage ===
The British Union of Fascists used the word commonly to refer to members. Their marching song, set to the music of the began &#x27;Comrades, the voices&#x27;. The writer, E.D. Randall, defended the usage of the word by stating that &#x27;comrades&#x27; ‘fittingly and completely expresses the ideal of unity in the service of a common cause’

===Kenyan usage===
In Kenya, the use of the word comrade is in a more traditional sense to mean &#x27;member&#x27;. It is commonly used by trade unionists, political parties and University students as a form of solidarity and common identity. It features prominently in chant songs by University student leaders and popular youth culture as a term of endearment. 

===Cuban usage===
In Cuba the corresponding revolutionary form of address was &quot;compañero&quot;, e.g., Compañero Fidel; see Cuban Spanish

*The Czech word for comrade is (m.) and (f.). In 19th century Czech, it was a poetic word, meaning &#x27;fellow&#x27;.

After the Communist Party gained power in 1948, the word displaced all prior titles like , (&quot;Mister&quot;, &quot;Madam&quot;) and became the title used generally for everyone. Nowadays, it is used only in (actual or, more often, ironic) Communist context. After the Velvet Revolution, an attempt was made in the Czech Social Democratic Party to replace with (&quot;friend&quot;) as a form of an address, but it didn&#x27;t catch on.

*The Georgian word is ().
*In German, the word is for a male, or for a female. The meaning is that of a fellow, a companion or an associate. Since &quot;Kamerad&quot; is the usual term for a fellow soldier in German military language, the word is associated with right-wing rather than left-wing groups. Communists and socialists, especially party members of the SED and SPD use the word (fem. ; i.e. &quot;partner&quot;, in the sense of a fellow member of a co-operative) with the socialist association that &#x27;comrade&#x27; has in English.. The members of the Nazi party NSDAP used the variant Parteigenosse (lit. party-comrade).

At present, its political use is considered old-fashioned, mainly restricted to Israeli Communists; the same word exists also in Yiddish, which is one possible origin of the colloquial Australian word &quot;&quot;.) The Hebrew and the female are still widely used in a non-political sense, as meaning simply &#x27;friend&#x27; (in certain contexts also meaning &#x27;boyfriend&#x27;/&#x27;girlfriend&#x27;).
* The Hindi equivalent for comrade is &quot;kômrēḍ&quot; (कॉमरेड) or &quot;sāthī&quot; (साथी). It is widely used among leftist (communist) parties of India, e.g., Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Revolutionary Socialist Party (India), Forward Bloc and others.

<doc id="647503" wikidata="Q49543" url="?curid=647503" title="Delta IV">
<text>Delta IV was a group of five expendable launch systems in the Delta rocket family. It flew 45 missions from 2002 to 2024. Originally designed by Boeing&#x27;s Defense, Space and Security division for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, the Delta IV became a United Launch Alliance (ULA) product in 2006. The Delta IV was primarily a launch vehicle for United States Air Force (USAF) military payloads, but was also used to launch a number of United States government non-military payloads and a single commercial satellite. 

The Delta IV had two main versions which allowed the family to cover a range of payload sizes and masses: the Medium (which had four configurations) and Heavy. The final flight of Medium occurred in 2019. The final flight of Heavy was in April 2024.

Delta IV vehicles were built in the ULA facility in Decatur, Alabama. Final assembly was completed at the launch site by ULA: at the horizontal integration facility for launches from SLC-37B pad at Cape Canaveral and in a similar facility for launches from SLC-6 pad at Vandenberg Space Force Base.

== History ==
The latest evolutionary development of the Delta rocket family, Delta IV was introduced to meet the requirements of the United States Air Force&#x27;s (USAF) Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV, now National Security Space Launch (NSSL)) program. While the Delta IV retains the name of the Delta family of rockets, major changes were incorporated. Perhaps the most significant change was the switch from kerosene to liquid hydrogen fuel, with new tankage and a new engine required.

During the Delta IV&#x27;s development, a small variant was considered. This would have featured the Delta II second stage, an optional Thiokol Star 48B third stage, and the Delta II payload fairing, all atop a single Common Booster Core (CBC). The Small variant was dropped by 1999.

In 2002, the Delta IV was first launched, with the RS-68 becoming the first large liquid-propellant rocket engine designed in the United States since the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) in the 1970s.

The L3 Technologies Redundant Inertial Flight Control Assembly (RIFCA) guidance system originally used on the Delta IV was common to that carried on the Delta II, although the software was different because of the differences between the Delta II and Delta IV. The RIFCA featured six ring laser gyroscopes and accelerometers each, to provide a higher degree of reliability.

Boeing initially intended to market Delta IV commercial launch services. However, the Delta IV entered the space launch market when global capacity was already much higher than demand. Furthermore, as an unproven design it had difficulty finding a market in commercial launches, and Delta IV launch costs are higher than comparable vehicles of the same era. In 2003, Boeing pulled the Delta IV from the commercial market, citing low demand and high costs. In 2005, Boeing stated that it sought to return the Delta IV to commercial service.

As of 2009, the USAF funded Delta IV EELV engineering, integration, and infrastructure work through contracts with Boeing Launch Services (BLS). On 8 August 2008, the USAF Space and Missile Systems Center increased the &quot;cost plus award fee&quot; contract with BLS for US$1.656 billion to extend the period of performance through the 30 September 2008 (FY09). In addition, a US$557.1 million option was added to cover FY10.

In February 2010, naturalized citizen Dongfan Chung, an engineer working with Boeing, was the first person convicted under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996. Chung passed on classified information on designs including the Delta IV rocket to China and was sentenced to 15 years.

In March 2015, ULA announced plans to phase out the Delta IV Medium by 2018.

With the exception of the first launch, which carried the Eutelsat W5 commercial communications satellite, all Delta IV launches have been paid for by the US government. In 2015, ULA stated that a Delta IV Heavy is sold for nearly US$400 million.

=== RS-68A booster engine upgrade ===
The possibility of a higher performance Delta IV was first proposed in a 2006 RAND Corporation study of national security launch requirements out to 2020. A single National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) payload required an increase in the lift capability of the Delta IV Heavy. Lift capacity was increased by developing the higher-performance RS-68A engine, which first flew on 29 June 2012. ULA phased out the baseline RS-68 engine with the launch of Delta flight 371 on 25 March 2015. All following launches used the RS-68A, and the engine&#x27;s higher thrust allowed the use of a single standardized CBC design for all Delta IV Medium and M+ versions. This upgrade reduced cost and increased flexibility, since any standardized CBC could be configured for zero, two, or four solid-propellant rocket boosters. However, the new CBC led to a slight performance loss for most medium configurations. The Delta IV Heavy required non-standard CBCs for the core and boosters.

Payload capacities after RS-68A upgrade
Payload capacities with original RS-68

*Masses include a Payload Attach Fitting (240 kg to 1,221 kg depending on payload).

=== Proposed upgrades that were not implemented ===
Possible future upgrades for the Delta IV included adding extra strap-on solid motors, higher-thrust main engines, lighter materials, higher-thrust second stages, more (up to eight) strap-on CBCs, and a cryogenic propellant cross feed from strap on boosters to the common core.

At one point, NASA planned to use Delta IV or Atlas V to launch the proposed Orbital Space Plane, which eventually became the Crew Exploration Vehicle and then the Orion. Orion was intended to fly on the Ares I launch vehicle, then the Space Launch System after Ares I was cancelled.

In 2009, The Aerospace Corporation reported on NASA results of a study to determine the feasibility of modifying Delta IV to be crew-rated for use in NASA human spaceflight missions. According to Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology the study, &quot;found that a Delta IV heavy [...] could meet NASA&#x27;s requirements for getting humans to low Earth orbit&quot;.

A proposed upgrade to the Delta IV family was the addition of extra solid motors. The Medium+ (4,4) would have used existing mount points to pair the four GEM 60s of the M+ (5,4) with the upper stage and fairing of the (4,2). An M+ (4,4) would have had a GTO payload of , a LEO payload of , and could have been available within 36 months of the first order. It was also considered to add extra GEM 60s to the M+ (5,4), which would have required adding extra attachment points, structural changes to cope with the different flight loads, and launch pad and infrastructure changes. The Medium+ (5,6) and (5,8) would have flown with six and eight SRBs respectively, for a maximum of up to to GTO with the M+ (5,8). The Medium+ (5,6) and (5,8) could have been available within 48 months of the first order.

=== Successors ===
The Vulcan Centaur is planned to replace the Atlas V and Delta IV rockets. Vulcan Centaur had been projected to enter service by 2023, using the BE-4 methane-fueled rocket engine, but the first Vulcan launched on 8 January 2024. The Atlas V is expected to stay in service for a few years after Vulcan&#x27;s inaugural launch, and the Delta IV Heavy was discontinued in April 2024.

== Delta IV Medium ==
The Delta IV Medium (also referred to as &#x27;single stick&#x27;) was available in four configurations: Medium, Medium+ (4,2), Medium+ (5,2), and Medium+ (5,4).

The Delta IV Medium (Delta 9040) was the most basic Delta IV. It featured a single CBC and a modified Delta III second stage, with 4-meter liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks (called a Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS)) and a 4-meter payload fairing. The Delta IV Medium was capable of launching 4,200 kg to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). From Cape Canaveral, GTO is 1804 m/s away from GEO. The mass of fairing and payload attach fittings have been subtracted from the gross performance.

The Delta IV Medium+ (4,2) (Delta 9240) had the same CBC and DCSS as the Medium, but with the addition of two Orbital ATK-built 1.5-m (60-in) diameter solid rocket booster Graphite-Epoxy Motors (GEM 60s) strap-on boosters to increase payload capacity to 6,150 kg to GTO.

The Delta IV Medium+ (5,2) (Delta 9250) was similar to the Medium+ (4,2), but had a 5-m–diameter DCSS and payload fairing for larger payloads. Because of the extra weight of the larger payload fairing and second stage, the Medium+ (5,2) could launch 5,072 kg to GTO.

The Delta IV Medium+ (5,4) (Delta 9450) was similar to the Medium+ (5,2), but used four GEM 60s instead of two, enabling it to lift 6,882 kg to GTO.

To encapsulate the satellite payload, a variety of different payload fairings were available. A stretched Delta III 4-meter diameter composite payload fairing was used on 4-meter Medium versions, while an enlarged, 5-meter diameter composite fairing was used on 5-meter Medium versions.

The Medium (4,2) version last flew on 22 August 2019, marking the retirement of the Delta IV Medium variants.

== Delta IV Heavy ==

The Delta IV Heavy (Delta 9250H) combines a diameter DCSS and payload fairing with two additional CBCs. These are strap-on boosters which are separated earlier in the flight than the center CBC. As of 2007, a longer 5 meter diameter composite fairing was standard on the Delta IV Heavy, with an aluminum isogrid fairing also available. The aluminum trisector (three-part) fairing was built by Boeing and derived from a Titan IV fairing. The trisector fairing was first used on the DSP-23 flight. The Delta IV with the extended fairing is over tall. The last launch took place on 9 April 2024, carrying the NROL-70 satellite, marking the conclusion of the Delta rocket family.

== Vehicle description ==
=== Common Booster Core ===
Each Delta IV consists of at least one Common Booster Core (CBC). Each CBC is powered by one Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-68 engine, which burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.

On flights of the Medium, the RS-68 ran at 102% rated thrust for the first few minutes of flight, and then throttled down to 58% rated thrust before main engine cutoff. On the Heavy, the main CBC&#x27;s engine throttles down to 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This conserves propellant and allows the main CBC to burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC&#x27;s engine again throttles up to 102% before throttling back down to 58% prior to main engine cutoff.

The RS-68 engine is mounted to the lower thrust structure of the CBC by a four-legged (quadrapod) thrust frame and enclosed in a protective composite conical thermal shield. Above the thrust structure is an aluminum isogrid (a grid pattern machined out of the inside of the tank to reduce weight) liquid hydrogen tank, followed by a composite cylinder called the centerbody, an aluminum isogrid liquid oxygen tank, and a forward skirt. Along the back of the CBC is a cable tunnel to hold electrical and signal lines, and a feedline to carry the liquid oxygen to the RS-68 from the tank. The CBC is of a constant, diameter.

=== Delta Cryogenic Second Stage ===

The upper stage of the Delta IV was the Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS). The DCSS was based on the Delta III upper stage but has increased propellant capacity. Two versions have been produced: a diameter DCSS that was retired with the Delta IV Medium and a diameter DCSS that remains in service with the Delta IV Heavy. The 4 m diameter version lengthened both Delta III propellant tanks, while the 5-meter version has an extended diameter liquid hydrogen tank and a further lengthened liquid oxygen tank. Regardless of the diameter, each DCSS is powered by one RL10B-2 engine, with an extendable carbon-carbon nozzle to improve specific impulse. Two different interstages are used to mate the first stage and DCSS. A tapering interstage that narrowed down from 5 m to 4 m diameter was used to mate the 4 m DCSS to the CBC, while a cylindrical interstage is used to mate the 5 m DCSS. Both interstages were built from composites and enclosed the liquid oxygen tank, with the larger liquid hydrogen tank making up part of the vehicle&#x27;s outer mold line.

=== Launch sites ===
Delta IV launched from either of two rocket launch complexes. Launches on the East coast of the United States used Space Launch Complex 37 (SLC-37) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. On the West coast, polar-orbit and high-inclination launches used Vandenberg Space Force Base&#x27;s Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6).

Launch facilities at both sites are similar. A Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) is situated some distance from the pad. Delta IV CBCs and second stages to be mated and tested in the HIF before they are moved to the pad. The partial horizontal rocket assembly of the Delta IV is somewhat similar to the Soyuz launch vehicle, which is completely assembled horizontally. The Space Shuttles, the past Saturn launch vehicles, and the Space Launch System are assembled and rolled out to the launch pad entirely vertically.

Movement of the Delta IVs among the various facilities at the pad was facilitated by rubber-tired Elevating Platform Transporters (EPTs) and various transport jigs. Diesel engine EPTs are used for moving the vehicles from the HIF to the pad, while electric EPTs are used in the HIF, where precision of movement is important.

The basic launchpad structure includes a flame trench to direct the engine plume away from the rocket, lightning protection, and propellant storage. In the case of Delta IV, the vehicle was completed on the launch pad inside a building. This Mobile Service Tower (MST) provides service access to the rocket and protection from the weather and is rolled away from the rocket on launch day. A crane at the top of the MST lifts the encapsulated payload to the vehicle and also attached the GEM 60 solid motors for Delta IV Medium launches. The MST is rolled away from the rocket several hours before launch. At Vandenberg, the launch pad also has a Mobile Assembly Shelter (MAS), which completely encloses the vehicle; at CCAFS, the vehicle is partly exposed near its bottom.

Beside the vehicle is a Fixed Umbilical Tower (FUT), which has two (VSFB) or three (CCAFS) swing arms. These arms carry telemetry signals, electrical power, hydraulic fluid, environmental control air flow, and other support functions to the vehicle through umbilical lines. The swing arms retract at T-0 seconds once the vehicle is committed to launch.

Under the vehicle is a Launch Table, with six Tail Service Masts (TSMs), two for each CBC. The Launch Table supports the vehicle on the pad, and the TSMs provide further support and fueling functions for the CBCs. The vehicle is mounted to the Launch Table by a Launch Mate Unit (LMU), which is attached to the vehicle by bolts that sever at launch. Behind the Launch Table is a Fixed Pad Erector (FPE), which used two long-stroke hydraulic pistons to raise the vehicle to the vertical position after being rolled to the pad from the HIF. Beneath the Launch Table is a flame duct, which deflects the rocket&#x27;s exhaust away from the rocket or facilities.

=== Vehicle processing ===
Delta IV CBCs and DCSSs are assembled at ULA&#x27;s factory in Decatur, Alabama. They are then loaded onto the R/S &quot;RocketShip&quot;, a roll-on/roll-off cargo vessel, and shipped to either launch pad. There, they are offloaded and rolled into a HIF. For Delta IV Medium launches, the CBC and DCSS were mated in the HIF. For Delta IV Heavy launches, the port and starboard strap-on CBCs are also mated in the HIF.

Various tests are performed, and then the vehicle is rolled horizontally to the pad, where the Fixed Pad Erector (FPE) is used to raise the vehicle to the vertical position. At this time, the GEM 60 solid motors, if any are required, are rolled to the pad and attached to the vehicle. After further testing, the payload (which has already been enclosed in its fairing) is transported to the pad, hoisted into the MST by a crane, and attached to the vehicle. Finally, on launch day, the MST is rolled away from the vehicle, and the vehicle is ready for launch.

=== Notable launches ===

The first payload launched with a Delta IV was the &quot;Eutelsat W5&quot; communications satellite. A Medium+ (4,2) from Cape Canaveral carried the communications satellite into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) on 20 November 2002.

&quot;Heavy Demo&quot; was the first launch of the Delta IV Heavy in December 2004 after significant delays due to bad weather. Due to cavitation in the propellant lines, sensors on all three CBCs registered depletion of propellant. The strap-on CBCs and then core CBC engines shut down prematurely, even though sufficient propellant remained to continue the burn as scheduled. The second stage attempted to compensate for the shutdown and burned until it ran out of propellant. This flight was a test launch carrying a payload of:
*&quot;DemoSat&quot; 6020 kg; an aluminum cylinder filled with 60 brass rods planned to be carried to GEO; however due to the sensor faults, the satellite did not reach this orbit.
*&quot;NanoSat-2&quot;, carried to low Earth orbit (LEO) a set of two very small satellites of 24 and 21 kg, nicknamed &quot;Sparky&quot; and &quot;Ralphie&quot; planned to orbit for one day. Given the under-burn, the two most likely did not reach a stable orbit.

&quot;NROL-22&quot; was the first Delta IV launched from SLC-6 at Vandenberg Space Force Base (VSFB). It was launched aboard a Medium+ (4,2) in June 2006 carrying a classified satellite for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).

&quot;DSP-23&quot; was the first launch of a valuable payload aboard a Delta IV Heavy. This was also the first Delta IV launch contracted by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The main payload was the 23rd and final Defense Support Program missile-warning satellite, DSP-23. Launch from Cape Canaveral occurred on 10 November 2007.

&quot;NROL-26&quot; was the first Delta IV Heavy EELV launch for the NRO. USA 202, a classified reconnaissance satellite, lifted off 18 January 2009.

&quot;NROL-32&quot; was a Delta IV Heavy launch, carrying a satellite for NRO. The payload is speculated to be the largest satellite sent into space. After a delay from 19 October 2010, the rocket lifted off on 21 November 2010.

&quot;NROL-49&quot; lifted off from Vandenberg AFB on 20 January 2011. It was the first Delta IV Heavy mission to be launched out of Vandenberg. This mission was for the NRO and its details are classified.

On 4 October 2012, a Delta IV M+ (4,2) experienced an anomaly in the upper stage&#x27;s RL10B-2 engine which resulted in lower than expected thrust. While the vehicle had sufficient fuel margins to successfully place the payload, a GPS Block IIF satellite USA-239, into its targeted orbit, investigation into the glitch delayed subsequent Delta IV launches and the next Atlas V launch (AV-034) due to commonality between the engines used on both vehicles&#x27; upper stages. By December 2012, ULA had determined the cause of the anomaly to be a fuel leak (into the combustion chamber), and Delta IV launches resumed in May 2013. After two more successful launches, further investigation led to the delay of Delta flight 365 with the GPS IIF-5 satellite. Originally scheduled to launch in October 2013, the vehicle lifted off on 21 February 2014.

A Delta IV Heavy launched the Orion spacecraft on an uncrewed test flight, EFT-1, on 5 December 2014. The launch was originally planned for 4 December 2014, but high winds and valve issues caused the launch to be rescheduled for 5 December 2014.

On August 12, 2018, another Delta IV Heavy launched the Parker Solar Probe on a mission to explore or &quot;touch&quot; the outer corona of the Sun.

The second GPS Block III satellite was launched with the final Delta IV Medium+ (4,2) configuration rocket on 22 August 2019.

The final flight from Vandenberg of the Delta IV Heavy launched the NROL-91 mission in September 2022.

The final flight from Cape Canaveral of the Delta IV Heavy and of the Delta rocket family took place in April 2024 carrying the NROL-70 mission.

<text>The [[Acts of Accession|Treaty of Accession]] 2003 was the agreement between the member states of the European Union and ten countries (Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia), concerning these countries&#x27; accession into the EU (see 2004 enlargement of the European Union). At the same time it changed a number of points which were originally laid down in the Treaty of Nice.
The treaty was signed on 16 April 2003 in Athens, Greece and it entered into force on 1 May 2004, resulting in enlargement of the European Union with 10 states.

==Background==
The European Union comprises a large number of overlapping legal structures which is a result of it being defined by successive international treaties.

As well as other acts which together form the current legal framework (acquis) of the EU, the Treaty of Accession 2003 modifies:
*the Treaty of Rome (establishing the European Economic Community),
*the Euratom Treaty (establishing the European Atomic Energy Community)
*the Maastricht Treaty (establishing the European Union)

All changes to the above treaties are made by article 11-19 in part two of the accession treaty. Beside of revising voting weights and the number of member state representatives at all European institutions, the most notable change outlined how Qualified Majority Voting shall be handled in the Council of the European Union. As from 1 November 2004, whenever the Council vote to adopt a decision by Qualified Majority, this need support both from a majority of member states which at the same time represents minimum 232 out of 321 weighted votes (72,3%), while also as a third requirement those states must represent at least 62% of the total population of the Union. Otherwise the decision in question shall not be adopted.

The Treaty&#x27;s full name in English is:

:&quot;Treaty between the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Member States of the European Union) and the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, concerning the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union&quot;.

* The Treaty of Accession was selected as a main motif in numerous collectors&#x27; coins. One of sample is the €10 Greece EU Presidency commemorative coin, minted in 2003 to celebrate the event. In the obverse of the coin is written in English and Greek &quot;Hellenic Presidency of E.U.&quot; with the official insignia of the Greek presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2003 shown in the center.

<text>The Faculty of Law (&quot;Det juridiske fakultet&quot;) at the University of Copenhagen has two departments including a number of research centres and prepares students for the Bachelor of Law degree (BA) and the profession degree in Law, cand. jur. (candidatus (masculinum) or candidata (femininum) juris). The faculty runs a special library, known as the Law Laboratory, for students.

== The Faculty ==

The Faculty of Law at the University of Copenhagen is Denmark&#x27;s largest law school, and one of the largest in Northern Europe, with approximately 4,000 law students. One of the main objectives of the faculty is to intensify contacts with foreign universities and law schools. These contacts have greatly increased in recent years. They include such activities as encouraging research and studies abroad, international student exchanges, faculty exchanges and a developing programme for visiting scholars.

The Faculty of Law at the University of Copenhagen has existed since 1479 when the University was founded. The instituting statute founding the Faculty is still preserved in the archives of the Danish Royal Library. The University of Copenhagen is the largest university in Scandinavia and the only Scandinavian university ranked among the top 50 universities worldwide. The Faculty of Law of the Royal Frederick University in Norway, established in 1811 as the second law faculty in then-Denmark-Norway, was based on the curriculum of the University of Copenhagen Faculty of Law and retained strong similarities until recently.

The Faculty&#x27;s research covers a wide range of topics.
Additionally, the Faculty has a number of research centres:
* CECS: Centre for Comparative and European Constitutional Studies
* Centre for Pension Law
* Centre for Studies in Legal Culture
* FOCOFIMA - Forum for Company Law and Financial Market Law
* WELMA - Legal Studies in Welfare and EU Market Integration
* Centre for Information and Innovation Law (CIIR)
* iCourts - The Danish National Research Foundation&#x27;s Centre of Excellence for International Courts

== Seal ==
The seal of the faculty contains the following text

which is written in a circle around a lindworm above which is a sceptre and a sword. The lindworm symbolizes the struggle against evil, while the sceptre is the power of the state and the sword is justice.

The seal is based on the seal given to the Faculty by the King in 1531.

== Law Programmes ==
The Faculty of Law offers 4 different degrees
The second degree of the law programme (LLM) takes a minimum of two years to complete. In Danish, the degree, which is awarded after a minimum of five years&#x27; of undergraduate and graduate studies, is called the candidatus or candidata juris, commonly shortened to cand.jur. This degree is equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree. The official length of the programme is 120 ECTS Credits.

The PhD course is a three-year researcher training course. During this period the Ph.D. student must attend courses, acquire teaching experience and take part in the research environment at other universities. Admission is on an individual basis and subject to an overall evaluation of the project and personal qualifications of the applicant. Only a limited number of applicants are accepted, depending on the financial resources available and other criteria such as counselling facilities. The most important aspect of the PhD course of studies is the preparation of a written thesis that forms the basis of the award of a PhD degree after an oral public defence (viva). Subject to academic merit PhD theses are published by the publishing house Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag.

The master in Mediation and Conflict Resolution is part of the Faculty&#x27;s continuing education programme.

<doc id="647512" wikidata="Q428114" url="?curid=647512" title="Germania (book)">
<text>The Germania, written by the Roman historian Publius Cornelius Tacitus around 98 AD and originally titled On the Origin and Situation of the Germans (), is a historical and ethnographic work on the Germanic peoples outside the Roman Empire.

==Contents==
The &quot;Germania&quot; begins with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the Germanic people (chapters 1–27); it then describes individual peoples, beginning with those dwelling closest to Roman lands and ending on the uttermost shores of the Baltic, among the amber-gathering Aesti, the Fenni, and the unknown peoples beyond them.

Tacitus says (chapter 2) that physically, the Germanic peoples appear to be a distinct nation, not an admixture of their neighbors, since nobody would desire to migrate to a climate as horrid as that of Germania. They are divided into three large branches, the Ingaevones, the Irminones, and the Istaevones, deriving their ancestry from three sons of Mannus, son of Tuisto, their common forefather.

In chapter 4, he mentions that they all have common physical characteristics, blue eyes (&quot;truces et caerulei oculi&quot; = &quot;sky-coloured, azure, dark blue, dark green&quot;), reddish hair (&quot;rutilae comae&quot; = &quot;red, golden-red, reddish yellow&quot;), and large bodies, vigorous at the first onset but not tolerant of exhausting labour, tolerant of hunger and cold, but not of heat or thirst.

In chapter 7, Tacitus describes their government and leadership as somewhat merit-based and egalitarian, with leadership by example rather than authority, and punishments are carried out by the priests. He mentions (chapter 8) that the opinions of women are given respect. In chapter 11, Tacitus describes a form of folk assembly rather similar to the public things recorded in later Germanic sources: in these public deliberations, the final decision rests with the men of the group as a whole.

Tacitus further discusses the role of women in chapters 7 and 8, mentioning that they often accompany the men to battle and offer encouragement. He says that the men are often motivated to fight for the women because of an extreme fear of losing them to captivity. Tacitus says (chapter 18) that the Germanic peoples are mainly content with one wife, except for a few political marriages, and specifically and explicitly compares this practice favorably to other cultures. He also records (chapter 19) that adultery is very rare, and that an adulterous woman is shunned afterward by the community regardless of her beauty. In chapter 45, Tacitus mentions that the people to the north of the Germanic peoples, the Sitones, &quot;resemble [the Suevi Scandinavians] in all respects but one - woman is the ruling sex.&quot; &quot;This,&quot; Tacitus comments, &quot;is the measure of their decline, I will not say below freedom, but even below decent slavery.&quot;

==Purpose and sources==
Ethnography had a long and distinguished heritage in classical literature, and the &quot;Germania&quot; fits squarely within the tradition established by authors from Herodotus to Julius Caesar. Tacitus himself had already written a similar—albeit shorter—essay on the lands and peoples of Britannia in his &quot;Agricola&quot; (chapters 10–13).

Tacitus himself is thought to have never travelled to Germania, thus his information is second-hand at best. Ronald Syme supposed that Tacitus closely copied the lost &quot;Bella Germaniae&quot; of Pliny the Elder, since the &quot;Germania&quot; is in some places outdated: in its description of Danubian groups, says Syme, &quot;they are loyal clients of the Empire ... Which is peculiar. The defection of these peoples in the year 89 during Domitian&#x27;s war against the Dacians modified the whole frontier policy of the Empire.&quot; While Pliny may have been the primary source, scholars have identified others; among them are Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Gallic War&quot;, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Posidonius, Aufidius Bassus, and numerous nonliterary sources, presumably based on interviews with traders and soldiers who had ventured beyond the Rhine and Danube borders, and Germanic mercenaries in Rome.

==Reception==
One of the minor works of Tacitus, &quot;Germania&quot; was not widely cited or used before the Renaissance. In antiquity, Lucian appears to imitate a sentence from it. It was largely forgotten during the Middle Ages. In the West, it was cited by Cassiodorus in the sixth century and used more extensively by Rudolf of Fulda in the ninth. In the East, it was used by the anonymous author of the Frankish Table of Nations in the early sixth century and possibly by the Emperor Maurice in his &quot;Strategikon&quot; later that century. In the ninth century, the Frankish Table was incorporated into the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, which ensured a wide diffusion to at least some of the &quot;Germania&quot;&#x27;s information. Guibert of Nogent, writing his autobiography around 1115, quotes &quot;Germania&quot;.

&quot;Germania&quot; survives in a single manuscript that was found in Hersfeld Abbey (&quot;Codex Hersfeldensis&quot;) in 1425. This was brought to Italy, where Enea Silvio Piccolomini, later Pope Pius II, first examined and analyzed the book. This sparked interest among German humanists, including Conrad Celtes, Johannes Aventinus, and Ulrich von Hutten and beyond.

The peoples of medieval Germany (the Kingdom of Germany in the Holy Roman Empire) were heterogenous, separated in distinct kingdoms, such as the Bavarians, Franconians, and Swabians, distinctions which remain evident in the German language and culture after the unification of Germany in 1871 (aside from Austria) and the establishment of modern Austria and Germany. During the medieval period, a self-designation of &quot;Germani&quot; was virtually never used; the name was only revived in 1471, inspired by the rediscovered text of &quot;Germania&quot;, to invoke the warlike qualities of the ancient Germans in a crusade against the Turks. Ever since its discovery, treatment of the text regarding the culture of the early Germanic peoples in ancient Germany remains strong, especially in German history, philology, and ethnology studies, and to a lesser degree in Scandinavian countries, as well. Beginning in 16th-century German humanism, German interest in Germanic antiquity remained acute throughout the period of Romanticism and nationalism. A scientific angle was introduced with the development of Germanic philology by Jacob Grimm.
Because of its influence on the ideologies of Pan-Germanism and Nordicism, Jewish-Italian historian Arnaldo Momigliano in 1956 described &quot;Germania&quot; and the &quot;Iliad&quot; as &quot;among the most dangerous books ever written&quot;. Christopher Krebs, a professor at Stanford University, claims in a 2012 study that &quot;Germania&quot; played a major role in the formation of the core concepts of Nazi ideology. The mainstream German reception is much less sensationalist and sees Tacitus&#x27;s description as more patronizing than laudatory, a predecessor of the classical noble savage concept which started in the 17th and 18th centuries in western European literature.

==&quot; Codex Aesinas&quot;==
The &quot;Codex Aesinas&quot; is believed to be portions of the Codex Hersfeldensis – the lost Germania manuscript brought to Rome from Hersfeld Abbey. It was rediscovered in 1902 by priest-philologist Cesare Annibaldi in the possession of Count Aurelio Balleani of Iesi.

Temporarily transferred to Florence for the controls at the state body of the fine arts, the manuscript was severely damaged during the 1966 flood. It was later restored and brought back to Iesi, and in 1994, the &quot;Codex Aesinas&quot; was given to the National Library in Rome, catalogued as &quot;Cod. Vitt. Em. 1631&quot;.

<text>North Manitou Island ( ) is located in Lake Michigan, approximately west-northwest of Leland, Michigan. It is nearly eight miles long and more than four miles (6 km) wide, with of shoreline. It has a land area of 57.876 km2 (22.346 sq mi) and has no population. The smaller South Manitou Island lies to its southwest.



==Description==
North Manitou Island is shaped like an upside-down teardrop, with the now-forested body of the &#x27;drop&#x27; surrounding Lake Manitou, and the tail of the drop narrowing into sandy, exposed Dimmick&#x27;s Point on the island&#x27;s southeastern extremity. The ferry dock and ranger station are on the island&#x27;s central eastern shore, directly east of Lake Manitou.

The island is in Leelanau County and is part of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, although it is over offshore. Park passes and camping fees are required. The island can be accessed by a ferry service from Leland; private watercraft are permitted with limited docking. No wheeled vehicles are allowed on the island other than those used by the National Park Service or to cart off a dead deer, or to move trash bags. No campfires are allowed on the island except at public firepits near the ranger station. Similarly there is only one water spigot, and one outhouse, in the same area.

==History==
===Before 1900===
A legend attributed to the Ojibwe explains the origin of the Manitou Islands and the Sleeping Bear Dunes. Long ago, the bear Mishe Mokwa and her two cubs sought to cross Lake Michigan from the Wisconsin shore to escape a great forest fire. The mother bear made it across, but her twin cubs, although they swam hard behind her, drowned in Lake Michigan. The great spirit covered them with sand to form the two Manitou islands. The mother bear lies and waits forever for her cubs to reach the shore - the Sleeping Bear Dunes. Most archeologists believe early habitation by Native Americans was only temporary due to the island&#x27;s scarcity of natural resources and the abundance of resources on the mainland. Despite this, there are signs of activity by Native Americans and some of the earliest archeological sites ever found in Michigan are located there. This includes seven sites, mostly on the east side. These sites date back to between 8,000 and 600 BC. Items found include: stone and flint tools, a copper awl, pottery and the remains of a canoe.

The initial European settlements were built by wood cutters supplying the fleet of the Great Lakes&#x27; wood-burning steamers with cord wood. Nicholas Pickard was probably the first (between 1842 and 1846). There is no record that Mr. Pickard owned any land on North Manitou when he began cutting wood there. While the record is clear that a wood-cutting station was established first on South Manitou, many travelers who have left written accounts did not make it clear which island they visited. Over 150 years later it can be difficult, if not impossible, to tell whether some stories of visiting &quot;the Manitous&quot; refer to North or South. Margaret Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Summer on the Lakes, in 1843&quot;, for example, very probably recounts a visit to South Manitou. Piers were constructed on the eastern and western sides of the island for the steamers to load wood while traveling up and down Lake Michigan.

===20th century===

After the passing of the wood-burning steamers, there were several more woodcutting eras on the island - for sawn boards and raw logs. Among others there was the Smith &amp; Hull operation on the west side (1906 to 1917), Peter Stormer&#x27;s east side and north end, a World War II era sawmill (near the site of the old dock in the Settlement), and The Lake Michigan Hardwood Company sawmill and later raw log cutting. Smith &amp; Hull also operated a standard gauge logging railroad, the &quot;Manitou Limited&quot;, running northeast 8 miles out of Crescent using two Shay locomotives from July 12, 1909 until 1915 when the timber ran out.

Some island settlers turned to farming, growing apples and cherries; remnants of these orchards can still be seen. From the late 1940s through the 1960s, the William R. Angell Foundation, which owned most of the island, used the imported deer population as an economic resource, hosting hunters. The Foundation artificially supported an abundant deer population with commercial salt blocks and custom feed manufactured by Kellogg Company. The deer pruned the island&#x27;s forests, giving an open, park-like feeling to even the deepest woods. A lighted runway, now a field in &quot;The Settlement&quot; on the eastern side of the island, next to the designated camping grounds and firepits, was used to bring in the hunters.

A summer colony grew on the east side of the island starting in the late 19th century. A group of successful Chicago businessmen built cottages (some of which remain on &quot;Cottage Row&quot;). The National Park Service occupies the old US Life-Saving Station (later the US Coast Guard) grounds near where the Leland boat lands campers. At the south end of the island was a lighthouse, built in 1896, automated in 1932, discontinued in 1938 and destroyed in 1942.

After the foundation sold most of the island to the United States government, the deer population declined due to the lack of artificial feed. The woods have grown up, many clearings are being obliterated; previously open space is rapidly being taken over by the woods. Now, after decades of regrowth, it is hard to spot any deer at all. All buildings built after the 1950s have been slated for demolition or have already been torn down.

Though at various times it was the less populated of the Manitou islands, apple and cherry orchards were planted during its settlement period. Now uninhabited except by the rotating National Park ranger and maintenance crews assigned there, the homesteads and most of the buildings of the island&#x27;s former settlers lie in varying states of ruin. Various buildings are shored up during the summer months. There is a cemetery in the southeast of the island where some of the island’s former inhabitants are buried.

==Today==
The Manitou islands are surrounded by over 50 known shipwrecks; a few of these are popular (and protected) diving spots.

The island has a system of trails, the remnants of the island&#x27;s unpaved roads. On the west side of the island one may still walk the &quot;old grade&quot; - the roadbed of the Smith &amp; Hull logging railroad. Wilderness camping is permitted throughout the island, and there are several designated camping sites near the ranger station at the dock. Filtered water is available at the ranger station, with limited natural inland water sources. There is one sizeable inland lake, Lake Manitou, suitable for fishing, and another, Tamarack Lake, which is now essentially a cedar swamp. The island is flanked by dunes on its northwest and southwest sides.

Island mammals include coyote, beaver, white-tailed deer, and eastern chipmunk. The raccoon population died out due to disease shortly before 2002. Numerous songbirds and waterfowl can be seen; of particular note is the endangered piping plover, which nests here. Human disturbance of the nesting area (near Dimmick’s Point) is disastrous to successful reproduction. Therefore, the Dimmick’s Point area is closed to hikers from May 1 through August 15 of each year. Bald eagles are commonly seen, especially during spring and early summer nesting season. Garter snakes are abundant on the island. There is an annual deer hunting season to limit the size of the population.

<text>Choctaw (not to be confused with Choctaw, Bolivar County) is an unincorporated community and Indian reservation located in Neshoba County, Mississippi, United States. Choctaw is approximately west of Philadelphia along Mississippi Highway 16.

It is the home of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, the only federally recognized Indian tribe in Mississippi.

The Choctaw have developed several resorts and attractions on their reservation, including the Pearl River Resort (comprising the Silverstar and Golden Moon casinos), Dancing Rabbit Golf Club, Geyser Falls Water Theme Park, and Lake Pushmataha. This 285-acre (1.2 km) fishing and recreation reservoir opened to the public in 2005.

<doc id="647518" wikidata="Q501202" url="?curid=647518" title="Civil Rights Act of 1875">
<text>The Civil Rights Act of 1875, sometimes called the Enforcement Act or the Force Act, was a United States federal law enacted during the Reconstruction era in response to civil rights violations against African Americans. The bill was passed by the 43rd United States Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1875. The act was designed to &quot;protect all citizens in their civil and legal rights&quot;, providing for equal treatment in public accommodations and public transportation and prohibiting exclusion from jury service. It was originally drafted by Senator Charles Sumner in 1870, but was not passed until shortly after Sumner&#x27;s death in 1875. The law was not effectively enforced, partly because President Grant had favored different measures to help him suppress election-related violence against blacks and Republicans in the Southern United States.

The Reconstruction era ended with the resolution of the 1876 presidential election, and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was the last federal civil rights law enacted until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. In 1883, the Supreme Court ruled in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; that the public accommodation sections of the act were unconstitutional, saying Congress was not afforded control over private persons or corporations under the Equal Protection Clause. Parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 were later re-adopted in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, both of which cited the Commerce Clause as the source of Congress&#x27;s power to regulate private actors.

==Legislative history==
The drafting of the bill was performed early in 1870 by United States Senator Charles Sumner, a dominant Radical Republican in the Senate, with the assistance of John Mercer Langston, a prominent African American who established the law department at Howard University. The bill was proposed by Senator Sumner and co-sponsored by Representative Benjamin F. Butler, both Republicans from Massachusetts, in the 41st Congress of the United States in 1870. Congress removed the coverage of public schools that Sumner had included. The act was passed by the 43rd Congress in February 1875 as a memorial to honor Sumner, who had just died. It was signed into law by United States President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1875.

==Enforcement==
President Grant had wanted an entirely different law to help him suppress election-related violence against blacks and Republicans in the South. Congress did not give him that, but instead wrote a law for equal rights to public accommodations that was passed as a memorial to Grant&#x27;s bitterest enemy, the late Senator Charles Sumner. Grant never commented on the 1875 law, and did nothing to enforce it, says historian John Hope Franklin. Grant&#x27;s Justice Department ignored it and did not send copies to US attorneys, says Franklin, while many federal judges called it unconstitutional before the Supreme Court shut it down. Franklin concludes regarding Grant and Hayes administrations, &quot;The Civil Rights Act was never effectively enforced.&quot; Public opinion was opposed, with the black community in support. Historian Rayford Logan looking at newspaper editorials finds the press was overwhelmingly opposed.

==Case law==

The Supreme Court, in an 8–1 decision, declared sections of the act unconstitutional in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; on October 15, 1883. Justice John Marshall Harlan provided the lone dissent. The Court held the Equal Protection Clause within the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination by the state and local government, but it does not give the federal government the power to prohibit discrimination by private individuals and organizations. The Court also held that the Thirteenth Amendment was meant to eliminate &quot;the badge of slavery,&quot; but not to prohibit racial discrimination in public accommodations. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 was the last federal civil rights bill signed into law until the Civil Rights Act of 1957, enacted during the Civil Rights Movement.

==Legacy==
The Civil Rights Act of 1875 is notable as the last major piece of legislation related to Reconstruction that was passed by Congress during the Reconstruction era. These include the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the four Reconstruction Acts of 1867 and 1868, the three Enforcement Acts of 1870 and 1871, and the three Constitutional Amendments adopted between 1865 and 1870.

Provisions contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1875 were later readopted by Congress during the Civil Rights Movement as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The 1964 and 1968 acts relied upon the Commerce Clause contained in Article One of the Constitution of the United States rather than the Equal Protection Clause within the Fourteenth Amendment.

<text>The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences () at the University of Copenhagen houses 13 departments, 33 centres, five schools, four hospitals, and three libraries.

The Faculty educates students in the areas of Human Health and Medical Sciences, Oral Health Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science.

Bente Merete Stallknecht has been the dean at the Faculty since 1 May 2022.

==History==
The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen was established in its current form in 1992 from the merging of Københavns Tandlægehøjskole (The Dental School of Copenhagen) and Det Lægevidenskabelige Fakultet (The Medical Faculty).

The School of Medical Sciences&#x27; history dates back to 1479, when the University of Copenhagen was founded. The University of Oslo Faculty of Medicine was founded in 1814 as a &quot;de facto&quot; Norwegian (partial) continuation of the medical faculty in Copenhagen, as a result of the Napoleonic Wars and the breakup of Denmark-Norway by the foreign powers. The medical faculty in Oslo therefore shared many of its traditions with the Copenhagen faculty. In 1842 the Faculty of Medicine and the Kirurgisk Akademi (Academy of Surgery) were merged to form the Faculty of Medical Science.

An integration of the health education programs was discussed in the late 1970s, and a decade later, the Faculty of Medical Science and the School of Dentistry were merged to form the Faculty of Health Sciences. Buildings built during this time period include the Panum Building. As of January 2016, Panum is the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences&#x27; largest building complex and houses six of the Faculty&#x27;s thirteen departments.

In 2005, the Center for Health and Society (Danish: &quot;Center for Sundhed og Samfund&quot;, abbr. CSS) was opened in the former Copenhagen Municipal Hospital in central Copenhagen. As of January 2016, the CSS houses most of the Department of Public Health and the School of Global Health.

The School of Oral Health Sciences operates under the Department of Odontology. Its history dates back the early 1890s, when Denmark&#x27;s first school of dentistry was founded on Nygade. The school moved its location twice, first in 1894 to Stormgade where the facilities were shared with the Teachers College and a school museum, and in 1928 to Trommesalen. In 1941, the school moved to newly constructed facilities on Jagtvej and changed its name to the School of Dentistry (&quot;Tandlægehøjskolen&quot;).

During the 1980s, the School of Dentistry was merged into the University of Copenhagen and moved to the recently erected Panum Building. The former School of Dentistry was merged with the university&#x27;s Faculty of Medical Science to form the Faculty of Health Sciences, and was renamed as the Central Department of Odontology (&quot;Odontologisk Centralinstitut&quot;). It consisted of two scientific and one clinical section. In the early 1990s, a revision of the dental education program resulted in 60% joint courses with the medical program. In 1993, a new university law was passed and the Department of Odontology received its current designation.

The School of Pharmaceutical Sciences&#x27; history dates back to 1892, when the Pharmaceutical College (&quot;Den Farmaceutiske Læreanstalt&quot;) was founded on Stockholmsgade. In 1942, the Pharmaceutical College moved into a new building at University Park and changed its name to the Danish Pharmaceutical College (&quot;Danmarks Farmaceutiske Højskole&quot;). In 2003, the Danish Pharmaceutical College was renamed as the Danish University of Pharmaceutical Science (&quot;Danmarks Farmaceutiske Universitet&quot;).

In 2007, the Danish University of Pharmaceutical Science was merged into the University of Copenhagen and was renamed as the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences. In 2012, the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences merged with the Faculty of Health Sciences and the veterinary part of the Faculty of Life Sciences to form the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences.

In January 2007, the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University was merged into the University of Copenhagen and was renamed as the Faculty of Life Sciences. This was later split up, with the veterinary part merging with the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences to form the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences and the rest merging into the Faculty of Science.

The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences received its current name when the Faculty of Health Sciences, the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and the veterinary part of the Faculty of Life Sciences were merged in 2012.

<text>The Department of Chemistry () is a department under the Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen. It is the largest basic research institute in chemistry in Denmark, and is responsible for the teaching of chemistry at all levels at the University of Copenhagen&#x27;s Faculty of Science: from undergraduate courses in chemistry to Ph.D.-level courses. Its office is located at the University of Copenhagen&#x27;s North Campus.

==History==
Research and education in chemistry has been conducted at the department since 1778, when the first Laboratorium Chymicum was established. Since then, the chemists have moved several times. In 1962, Universitetets Kemiske Laboratorium moved to its present location in the H.C. Ørsted Institute (HCØ), named after Hans Christian Ørsted who discovered electromagnetism in 1820.

<text>Raoul Louis Heertje (; born 11 March 1963) is a Dutch comedian. Being Jewish himself, his comedy performances include Jewish humour.

==Biography==
From 1983 till 1984 Heertje studied International Relations and Theatre Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. After that he studied in Birmingham till 1986.

The notable international appearances he made were in the TV shows of Ruby Wax, Clive James, Jeremy Clarkson and in the British satirical programme &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; (on series 9) in 1995. A year later he became a panelist in the successful Dutch version of the same show: &quot;Dit was het nieuws&quot;.

Raoul, and his brother Eric, founded comedyclub Toomler and Comedytrain, the stand-up comedy collective that introduced stand-up comedy in the Netherlands in the year 1990. In 2007 he is one of the members of The Amsterdam Underground Comedy Collective.

Heertje also wrote columns voor &quot;Het Parool&quot;.

His father is the economist Arnold Heertje.

==Comedytrain==
&quot;Comedytrain&quot; was the first stand-up comedy collective in the Netherlands. It was founded in 1990 by Raoul Heertje. Comedy club Toomler in Amsterdam is its home theatre.

The word Comedytrain is a combination of comedy and training. Its main goal was to give talented comedians, who did not succeed at once in making an hour and a half one-man show, a place to perform and develop, to try out, fail and succeed; to evaluate others and be evaluated by them.

Over the years Comedytrain has become the home of famous Dutch comedians, like Hans Teeuwen, Theo Maassen, Najib Amhali, Hans Sibbel, Thomas Acda, Ronald Goedemondt, Jan Jaap van der Wal, and Sanne Wallis de Vries.

Comedytrain is still a place where young comedians find a stage for developing as performers. Twice a year auditions are held for new talents to enter Comedytrain. The comedians do not only play the Toomler stage weekly, but also tour the Dutch theatres together, perform for companies and parties and play the many stages in theatre café&#x27;s and bars all over the country.

<text>Many Waters is a 1986 novel by American writer Madeleine L&#x27;Engle, part of the author&#x27;s Time Quintet (also known as the Time Quartet). The title is taken from the Song of Solomon 8:7: &quot;Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. If a man were to give all his wealth for love, it would be utterly scorned.&quot;

The principal characters of the story are Sandy and Dennys Murry, twin brothers who are somewhat out of place in the Murry family from &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;. The action of the story follows that of &quot;A Wind in the Door&quot; but precedes the climactic, apocalyptic event in &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet&quot;.

==Plot summary==

In the middle of a New England winter, identical twin brothers Sandy and Dennys accidentally disturb an experiment in their parents&#x27; laboratory and are teleported to a sandy desert. There, they are acquired by water-prospector &#x27;Japheth&#x27; and guided to an oasis, but Dennys is separated from the others. Sandy remains with Japheth and his elderly grandfather Lamech; there, Sandy is cured of heatstroke by a variety of improbable beings, including seraphim.

Dennys reappears in another tent and is thrown into a refuse heap. He later comes under the care of a friendly family in the center of the oasis, headed by a gruff but kindly patriarch called Noah. It soon becomes apparent that the boys have been interpolated into the story of Noah&#x27;s Ark, shortly before the Flood. Both Noah and Lamech receive mysterious instructions from God (known as El) concerning the building of the Ark. The twins come to understand that unicorns who can traverse space and time live in the oasis. Sinister supernatural beings known as the nephilim distrust the twins, and their human wives attempt to gather information about them. At several points, the wife of a nephil unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Sandy.

Separated for much of the book, the twins become more independent of each other and gain maturity over the course of a year in the desert. Both are in love with Noah&#x27;s beautiful and virtuous daughter Yalith (and she with them), but neither twin declares his affection until the very end of the novel. Dennys convinces Noah to reconcile with his father, Lamech, and both twins eventually care for Lamech&#x27;s gardens while he lies ill. After Lamech&#x27;s death, Sandy is kidnapped, but is eventually found by Japheth. Suspense arises when it becomes clear that there is no place on the Ark reserved for Sandy, Dennys, or Yalith. After both twins assist in the construction of the Ark, Yalith is taken by the seraphim to the presence of El. Sandy and Dennys are then returned to their own time and place by unicorns summoned by the seraphim.

==Major themes==
The story largely concerns the teenaged twins&#x27; emotional coming of age, but, like the other three novels about the Murry family, includes elements of fantasy and Christian theology such as the seraphim, a heavenly race of angels, and the nephilim, a race of giants that were the result of the mating of mortal women and angels, are the main antagonists of the story (see Genesis 6:1-4 ). Author Donald R. Hettinga notes that the world of Noah&#x27;s oasis is especially difficult for &quot;the empirically minded twins&quot; to accept because in L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s theology of &quot;a gradual Fall&quot;, it is still populated by manticores and unicorns, &quot;everyone can still see angels,&quot; and some people &quot;can still converse intimately with God.&quot; Similarities to the fantasy-science fiction works of C. S. Lewis, always present in L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s oeuvre, are particularly notable here. The twins&#x27; difficulty in believing in things that exist outside their empiricist world is a trait they must overcome in the story, because it is only by believing in a &quot;virtual unicorn&quot; that they can obtain transportation back to their everyday world.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the book &quot;the kind of intricate tale with complex characters and relationships that L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s readers have come to expect... A carefully wrought fable, entwining disparate elements from unicorns to particle physics, this will be enjoyed for its suspense and humor as well as its other levels of meaning.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Newbery Medal-winning author Susan Cooper wrote, &quot;Analogies between the Flood and the possibility of nuclear destruction are suggested from time to time, but no didactic conclusion is forced out of them... Miss L&#x27;Engle is above all a skillful storyteller, and every admirer of &#x27;A Wrinkle in Time&#x27; will have fun with &#x27;Many Waters.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Dane Rudhyar (March 23, 1895 – September 13, 1985), born Daniel Chennevière, was an American author, modernist composer, painter and humanistic astrologer. He was a pioneer of modern transpersonal astrology.

==Biography==
Dane Rudhyar was born in Paris on March 23, 1895. At the age of 12, a severe illness and surgery disabled him, and he turned to music and intellectual development to compensate for his lack of physical agility. He studied at the Sorbonne, University of Paris (graduating at the age of 16), and at the Paris Conservatoire. His early ventures into philosophy and his association with the artistic community in Paris led to his conviction that all existence is cyclical in character. Influenced by Nietzsche as a youth, Rudhyar envisioned himself as a &quot;seed man&quot; of new age cultural evolution.

In November 1916, Rudhyar&#x27;s music brought him to New York City, where his orchestral arrangements and original compositions were performed on April 4, 1917 at a performance of &quot;Métachorie&quot; by the New York Metropolitan Opera. This was one of the first polytonal pieces of music performed in the United States. He also met Sasaki Roshi, one of the early Japanese Zen teachers in America, who led him in the study of Oriental philosophy and occultism. During this period from 1917 to 1919, spent partly in New York City, partly in Canada, and partly in Philadelphia he adopted the name &quot;Rudhyar&quot; a cognate of several attractive Sanskrit words including the name of the god Rudra. His interest was further stimulated by his association with Theosophy, which began when he was asked to compose music for a production at the society&#x27;s headquarters in Los Angeles in 1920. Rudhyar became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1926. He stayed in California (often commuting to New York) through the 1920s and in 1930 married Marla Contento, secretary to independent Theosophist Will Levington Comfort. Comfort introduced Rudhyar to Marc Edmund Jones, who in turn introduced him to astrology. Rudhyar received mimeographed lessons on astrology from Jones.

Rudhyar learned astrology during a period when he was also studying the psychological writings of Carl Gustav Jung, and he began to think in terms of bringing astrology and Jungian psychology together. Rudhyar also cites Jan Smuts&#x27; book &quot;Holism and Evolution&quot; as an influence. The marriage between astrology and depth-psychology overcame some basic problems, including astrology&#x27;s deterministic approach to life and the trouble of designating an agreeable agent to produce the astrological effects. Rudhyar postulated that the stars did not cause the effects seen in human life but were pictures synchronistically aligned to human beings. They detailed psychological forces working in individuals, but did not override human freedom in responding to those forces, he said. At first he called his new interpretation &quot;harmonic astrology&quot; and as the ideas matured renamed it &quot;humanistic astrology,&quot; the subject of his monumental volume, &quot;The Astrology of Personality&quot;, published in 1936. A friend, Theosophist Alice A. Bailey (the person who invented the term &quot;New Age&quot;), encouraged the development of his thought and published his book on her press, Lucis Publishing. His initial writings were regular articles in Paul Clancy&#x27;s magazine &quot;American Astrology&quot; and Grant Lewi&#x27;s &quot;Horoscope Magazine&quot;.

Following his divorce in 1945, Rudhyar married the dancer Eya Fechin. Eya was the daughter of the well-known Russian-American painter Nicolai Fechin, with whom Rudhyar also became acquainted. It was at this time that Rudhyar began to undertake his larger-scale paintings. Rudhyar and Eya lived in Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa and New York, before eventually divorcing in 1953.

Over the next two decades Rudhyar continued to write and lecture on astrology, but while he was honored within the astrological community he was little known outside of it. It was not until the 1970s, as the New Age movement emerged, that major publishing houses discovered him and began to publish his writings: among the first was &quot;The Practice of Astrology&quot;, published in 1970 by Penguin Books.

In 1969 Rudhyar founded the &quot;International Committee for Humanistic Astrology&quot;, a small professional society that would work on the development of his perspective. He began one of the most fruitful periods of his life, turning out several books a year for the next decade. He began to absorb the insights of transpersonal psychology, which concentrated on exploring altered and exalted states of perception, and by the mid-1970s had moved beyond humanistic astrology to what he termed &quot;transpersonal astrology.&quot; He also began to reflect upon the New Age movement and wrote several of the more sophisticated volumes on planetary consciousness and New Age philosophy.

Dane Rudhyar died on September 13, 1985, in San Francisco, California.

==Astrological writings==

Most of Rudhyar&#x27;s more than forty books and hundreds of articles concern astrology and spirituality. The book that established his reputation in the astrological field was his first on the subject, &quot;The Astrology of Personality&quot; (1936). Arguing that astrology is not essentially predictive but rather productive of intuitive insights, &quot;The Astrology of Personality&quot; was one of the most influential tracts of &quot;free-will&quot; astrology, despite being written in the dense, circuitous style that characterizes much of Rudhyar&#x27;s writing.

Rudhyar&#x27;s astrological works were influential in the New Age movement of the 1960s and 1970s, especially among the hippies of San Francisco, where he lived and gave frequent lectures. Rudhyar regarded the &#x27;true early hippies&#x27; as potential harbingers of a New Age. In 1967 the scene reached its peak in the Summer of Love in San Francisco.&quot; Most notably, Dane Rudhyar predicted in 1972 that the Age of Aquarius would begin in 2062.

==Fiction novels==
Dane Rudhyar also wrote several novels:

&quot;When Cosmic Love Awakens – A Transpersonal Love Story&quot; was written and published in 1952. Story synopsis: There was a conjunction of Venus and Mars on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1951. On that day two men and a woman who worked at a New York City science fiction magazine office met a Mr. Ramar, who showed them how to travel to the planets within. When Cosmic Love Awakens:

&quot;Rania – An Epic Narrative&quot; was written in 1930 and first published in 1973. Story synopsis: It is the intense and dramatic story of the evolution of a woman&#x27;s soul. Rania&#x27;s tortuous search for spiritual growth sustains her in her final battle with the Powers of Darkness. Rania:

&quot;Return from No Return&quot; (subtitled &#x27;A Paraphysical Novel&#x27;) was also first published in 1973. Story synopsis: Set in a 22nd-century Earth with a unified world government intent on peaceful space exploration, a poetic astronaut agrees to undertake a physically perilous mission to travel beyond an outer-region threshold that has disintegrated all previous explorers. He intends to report back to his wife on Earth via telepathic communication methods that they have spent time scientifically preparing. As the book jacket says: &quot;...&quot;Return from No Return&quot; weaves the drama of a global crisis, an intense love story, and profound esoteric truths into a powerful and suspenseful novel.&quot;

==Transcendental art==

Dane Rudhyar joined the &quot;Transcendental Painting Group&quot; in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1938 and 1939. The idea behind transcendental painting and drawing was to paint or draw images of Jungian archetypes. Transcendental painting may be considered a cousin of surrealist art and a precursor of the cosmic art of the 1950s, the psychedelic art of the 1960s, and the visionary art of the 1970s. Throughout his career, Dane Rudhyar continued to paint and draw new transcendental artwork, or use artwork he had previously painted, to illustrate his pamphlets and books about astrology.

==Writings on music and musical compositions==
Dane Rudhyar wrote extensively on music as well, producing such books as &quot;Claude Debussy and His Work&quot; (1913), &quot;Dissonant Harmony&quot; (1928), &quot;Rebirth of Hindu Music&quot; (1928), &quot;The New Sense of Sound&quot; (1930), and &quot;The Magic of Tone and the Art of Music&quot; (1982).

Rudhyar&#x27;s own compositions tend to employ dissonant harmony, emphatically not of a systematic variety such as Charles Seeger&#x27;s; Rudhyar was philosophically opposed to such a rigid approach. His musical thought was influenced by Henri Bergson and theosophy, and he viewed composers as mediums, writing that &quot;the new composer&quot; was &quot;no longer a &#x27;composer,&#x27; but an evoker, a magician. His material is his musical instrument, a living thing, a mysterious entity endowed with vital laws of its own, sneering at formulas, fearfully alive.&quot; Rudhyar&#x27;s most distinctive music is for piano, including his &quot;Tetragram&quot; (1920–67) and &quot;Pentagram&quot; (1924–26) series, &quot;Syntony&quot; (1919–24, rev. 1967), and &quot;Granites&quot; (1929). His works are almost all composed of brief movements—he felt that length and its attendant structural demands led to abstraction and away from the sensuous physicality of sound. He influenced several early-20th-century composers including Ruth Crawford and Carl Ruggles, as well as members of the group centered around Henry Cowell known as the &quot;ultra-modernists.&quot; Cowell paid homage to him with a solo piano piece, &quot;A Rudhyar&quot; (1924).

Late in his life, Rudhyar&#x27;s musical work was rediscovered by the composers James Tenney, Hsiung-Zee Wong, and Peter Garland, who declared that Rudhyar&#x27;s &quot;best works occurred in the 1920s and...1970s!!!&quot; In 1983 Glenn Branca dedicated his &quot;Symphony No. 3 : Gloria&quot; to Rudhyar.

<text>The &quot;world&#x27;s funniest joke&quot; is a term used by Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire in 2002 to summarize one of the results of his research. For his experiment, named LaughLab, he created a website where people could rate and submit jokes. Purposes of the research included discovering the joke that had the widest appeal and understanding among different cultures, demographics and countries.

The History Channel eventually hosted a special on the subject.

==Winning joke==
The winning joke, which was later found to be based on a 1951 &quot;Goon Show&quot; sketch by Spike Milligan, was submitted by Gurpal Gosal of Manchester:

==Other findings==
Researchers also included five computer-generated jokes, four of which fared rather poorly, but one was rated higher than one third of the human jokes:

The joke that was submitted to LaughLab the most times was:
During a Science Vs podcast episode, Richard Wiseman said this about whether it&#x27;s actually the world&#x27;s funniest joke:

<text>The UCPH Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports () is a department under the Faculty of Science at University of Copenhagen (UCPH). It has facilities both at the university&#x27;s North Campus and Frederiksberg Campus.

==History==

The department&#x27;s predecessor, the Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences, was established in September 1997 through the consolidation of the former Laboratory for Human Physiology, the August Krogh Institute, and the Centre for Sports Research (&quot;Center for Idrætsforskning&quot;), all parts of the University of Copenhagen, and the formerly independent Danish State Institute of Physical Education (&quot;Danmarks Højskole for Legemsøvelser&quot;).

<text>In computing, vectored I/O, also known as scatter/gather I/O, is a method of input and output by which a single procedure call sequentially reads data from multiple buffers and writes it to a single data stream (gather), or reads data from a data stream and writes it to multiple buffers (scatter), as defined in a vector of buffers. &quot;Scatter/gather&quot; refers to the process of gathering data from, or scattering data into, the given set of buffers. Vectored I/O can operate synchronously or asynchronously. The main reasons for using vectored I/O are efficiency and convenience.

Vectored I/O has several potential uses:
* Atomicity: if the particular vectored I/O implementation supports atomicity, a process can write into or read from a set of buffers to or from a file without risk that another thread or process might perform I/O on the same file between the first process&#x27; reads or writes, thereby corrupting the file or compromising the integrity of the input
* Concatenating output: an application that wants to write non-sequentially placed data in memory can do so in one vectored I/O operation. For example, writing a fixed-size header and its associated payload data that are placed non-sequentially in memory can be done by a single vectored I/O operation without first concatenating the header and the payload to another buffer
* Efficiency: one vectored I/O read or write can replace many ordinary reads or writes, and thus save on the overhead involved in syscalls
* Splitting input: when reading data held in a format that defines a fixed-size header, one can use a vector of buffers in which the first buffer is the size of that header; and the second buffer will contain the data associated with the header

Standards bodies document the applicable functions codice_1 and codice_2 in POSIX 1003.1-2001 and the Single UNIX Specification version 2. The Windows API has analogous functions codice_3 and codice_4; however, unlike the POSIX functions, they require the alignment of each buffer on a memory page. Winsock provides separate codice_5 and codice_6 functions without this requirement.

While working directly with a vector of buffers can be significantly harder than working with a single buffer, using higher-level APIs
for working efficiently can mitigate the difficulties.

== Examples ==
The following example in the C programming language prints &quot;Hello, Wikipedia Community!&quot; to the standard output. Each word is saved into a single buffer and with only one call to codice_7, all buffers are printed to the standard output.
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/uio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 const char buf1[] = &quot;Hello, &quot;;
 const char buf2[] = &quot;Wikipedia &quot;;
 const char buf3[] = &quot;Community!\n&quot;;

 struct iovec bufs[] = {
 { .iov_base = (void *)buf1, .iov_len = strlen(buf1) },
 { .iov_base = (void *)buf2, .iov_len = strlen(buf2) },
 { .iov_base = (void *)buf3, .iov_len = strlen(buf3) },

 if (writev(STDOUT_FILENO, bufs, sizeof(bufs) / sizeof(bufs[0])) == -1)
 perror(&quot;writev()&quot;);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

 return EXIT_SUCCESS;


=== Rust ===
Rust provides the method on the trait.

use std::io::IoSlice;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
 let data1 = [1; 8];
 let data2 = [15; 8];
 let io_slice1 = IoSlice::new(&amp;data1);
 let io_slice2 = IoSlice::new(&amp;data2);

 let mut buffer = File::create(&quot;foo.txt&quot;)?;

 // Writes some prefix of the byte string, not necessarily all of it.
 buffer.write_vectored(&amp;[io_slice1, io_slice2])?;
 Ok(())

<text>Quincy Media, Inc., formerly known as Quincy Newspapers, Inc., was a family-owned media company that originated in the newspapers of Quincy, Illinois. The company&#x27;s history can be traced back to 1835, when the &quot;Bounty Land Register&quot; was one of four newspapers in Illinois. Over the next century, a number of mergers followed. The company moved into radio in 1947 and began television broadcasts in 1953.

The company was owned by the Oakley and Lindsay families of Quincy.

==History==
The corporation was formed in Quincy on June 1, 1926, as Quincy Newspapers after the merger of the &quot;Quincy Herald&quot;, direct descendant of the &quot;Illinois Bounty Land Register&quot; first published in Quincy in 1835, and the &quot;Quincy Whig-Journal&quot;, descendant of the &quot;Quincy Whig&quot; founded in 1838. The two papers were combined to form a single daily paper, the &quot;Quincy Herald-Whig.&quot;

The &quot;Herald&quot; was purchased in September 1891 by three men from Rockford, Charles L. Miller, Hedley John Eaton and Edmund Botsford. Miller had earlier founded the &quot;Rockford Daily Register&quot;, that city&#x27;s oldest newspaper. Subsequently, Miller brought to the &quot;Herald&quot; his brother-in-law and nephew, respectively, Aaron Burr Oakley and Ray M. Oakley, the first two generations of the Oakleys in the newspaper business in Quincy. Miller spent four years in Quincy, returning to Rockford in 1896 to join Harry M. Johnson in ownership of the &quot;Rockford Republic&quot;. He retired as editor of the &quot;Republic&quot; in 1913 and died in 1921. Hedley Eaton retired in 1913 and died in 1936. Eaton&#x27;s son John Dewitt Eaton stayed with the paper as Advertising Manager until his retirement in 1955.

Two brothers from Decatur, Frank M. Lindsay, Sr. and Arthur O. Lindsay, Sr. bought the &quot;Quincy Whig&quot; in 1915, with Arthur Lindsay taking up residence in Quincy as president and manager. Frank Lindsay remained in Decatur with the Decatur Herald and formed an association with another Illinois newspaper family, the Schaubs. In 1920, the Lindsays consolidated the &quot;Whig&quot; and &quot;The Quincy Journal&quot;, founded in 1883.

QNI entered broadcasting in 1947, the year it started Quincy&#x27;s first commercial FM station, WQDI. The following year QNI purchased Quincy Broadcasting Co. to operate WGEM, the city&#x27;s second AM station. WQDI became WGEM-FM in 1953.
Quincy Broadcasting produced the Quincy region&#x27;s first television broadcast on September 4, 1953, with the launch of WGEM-TV, the area&#x27;s NBC affiliate. The building containing the ground floor studios of the WGEM stations was also the former home of the Tremont Hotel, and Quincy Media continues to operate it as the New Tremont Apartments, containing both long-term and extended stay accommodations.

In 1969, QNI and six other newspaper entities formed American Newspapers Inc., which bought &quot;The New Jersey Herald&quot; in Newton, New Jersey, converting the semi-weekly to a daily and Sunday publication in 1970. QNI acquired controlling interest in American Newspapers in 1980 and became sole owner in 1986.

Beginning in the 1970s, QNI began a major expansion into television. WSJV in Elkhart, Indiana (serving South Bend) was acquired in 1974; KROC-TV (renamed KTTC) in Rochester, Minnesota in 1976; WHIS-TV (renamed WVVA) in Bluefield, West Virginia in 1979; KTIV in Sioux City, Iowa in 1989; and WREX-TV in Rockford in 1995. All of the stations were also NBC affiliates at their acquisitions except for WSJV and WREX, which were ABC affiliates; however, in 1995, WSJV dropped ABC for Fox, and soon thereafter WREX joined NBC. Also in 1995, &quot;The Merchant&quot;, a weekly shopper in Quincy was purchased by the company.

In June 2001, QNI purchased from Shockley Communications five ABC affiliates in Wisconsin: WKOW-TV in Madison, WAOW-TV in Wausau; WYOW in Eagle River (a satellite of WAOW); WXOW-TV in La Crosse; and WQOW-TV in Eau Claire (a semi-satellite of WXOW). Also purchased from SCC at the time was ProVideo of Wisconsin, Inc. consisting of a component digital online suite and a fully integrated non-linear online suite in Madison, Wisconsin. Concurrent with the Shockley purchase, KTTC entered into a shared services agreement with KXLT-TV, the Fox affiliate in Rochester, Minnesota. KTTC provides all services for KXLT excluding sales, traffic, and programming.

On July 1, 2006, QNI purchased KWWL, the NBC affiliate in Waterloo, Iowa, from Raycom Media. In February 2009, QNI purchased Crandon, Wisconsin&#x27;s WBIJ from the widow of the station&#x27;s founder, with the intention to operate the station as a satellite station of WAOW; QNI subsequently renamed the station WMOW to conform with its other Wisconsin properties.

On February 11, 2014, Quincy announced plans to acquire a number of small and mid-market stations from Granite Broadcasting, including WEEK-TV in Peoria, KBJR-TV in Superior, Wisconsin, KRII in Chisholm, Minnesota (a satellite of KBJR), and WBNG-TV in Binghamton, New York (the company&#x27;s first CBS affiliate; WEEK and KBJR/KRII are NBC affiliates). As part of the deal, Quincy originally planned to purchase WPTA, the ABC affiliate in Fort Wayne, Indiana, from Malara Broadcast Group, and provide services to ABC affiliate WHOI and MyNetworkTV affiliate WAOE in Peoria, NBC affiliate WISE-TV in Fort Wayne, and CBS affiliate KDLH in Duluth, Minnesota. In November 2014, the deal was reworked so that Quincy would acquire WISE and provide services to WPTA, retaining the arrangement between the stations established by Granite. In July 2015, the deal was reworked yet again; Quincy would, yet again, acquire WPTA instead of WISE, and Malara&#x27;s stations would be acquired by SagamoreHill Broadcasting. Quincy also proposed to wind down its shared services agreements with WISE and KDLH within nine months of the sale&#x27;s completion: both stations would move their existing network affiliations to WPTA and KBJR, and become independently-operated stations airing The CW. On September 15, 2015, the FCC approved the deal.

In 2015, the company&#x27;s flagship title dropped Quincy from its masthead and became simply the Herald-Whig. In 2016, the Herald-Whig and Quincy Media applied for a demolition permit for the historic Morgan-Wells House in Quincy for expansion of their offices. The NRHP-listed local landmark was the home of notable Quincy residents and institutions for over a century, now demolished.

In January 2016, the company changed its name to Quincy Media.

On May 21, 2018, it was announced that Quincy Media would acquire KDLH outright for $792,557 and WISE for $952,884. While the FCC normally prohibits one company from owning two television licenses in the same market when both are among the top four rated stations, Quincy submitted a filing saying that during the November 2017 &quot;sweeps&quot; period KBJR-TV was the top ranked station while KDLH placed fifth, and that WPTA was the second ranked station while WISE-TV placed fifth. The sale was completed on August 1.

On August 29, 2018, Quincy Media&#x27;s stations were pulled from Dish Network after failing to reach a new retransmission fee agreement. On October 12, Quincy Media reached a new agreement with Dish Network to continue carrying Quincy Media stations.

On October 29, 2018, Quincy announced it would be acquiring KVOA in Tucson, Arizona, from Cordillera Communications for $70 million as a side deal of the latter company&#x27;s acquisition by the E. W. Scripps Company. Two days later, on October 31, Quincy announced that it would be acquiring WSIL-TV in Harrisburg, Illinois and KPOB, Poplar Bluff, MO, from Mel Wheeler, Inc. for $24.5 million.

On May 10, 2019, Quincy announced it would purchase the &quot;Hannibal Courier-Post&quot; from GateHouse Media, marking its first daily newspaper expansion since 1969. Six days later, on May 16, Quincy announced the sale of the &quot;New Jersey Herald&quot; to GateHouse Media, ending Quincy&#x27;s 50-year ownership of the paper.

On January 7, 2021, television industry news website FTVLive obtained an internal memo from President and CEO Ralph Oakley confirming that Quincy Media had put itself up for sale. The news was later publicly confirmed by QMI.

On February 1, 2021, Gray Television announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire all Quincy Media television properties for $925 million in a cash transaction, along with the WGEM AM/FM radio stations in Quincy (Gray owned one small radio station in Texas otherwise, also acquired as part of another television group). As a result, several Quincy stations will be divested to be in compliance with regulations from the FCC and the Department of Justice. On April 29, it was announced that Allen Media Group will purchase 10 Quincy stations not being acquired by Gray Television for $380 million. The newspapers were sold to another family-owned publishing company, Phillips Media Group of Harrison, Arkansas, in a separate transaction. The transaction was completed on August 2.

<text>WSJV (channel 28) is a television station licensed to Elkhart, Indiana, United States, serving the South Bend area as an affiliate of the digital multicast network Heroes &amp; Icons. It is owned by Gray Media alongside NBC affiliate WNDU-TV (channel 16). The two stations share studios on the University of Notre Dame campus along State Road 933 on South Bend&#x27;s north side; WSJV&#x27;s transmitter is co-located within the WSBT-TV (channel 22) site on Ironwood Road in South Bend.

WSJV began broadcasting in 1954 as the NBC and ABC affiliate for the Elkhart–South Bend area, losing NBC to WNDU-TV when that station started in 1955. It broadcast on channel 52 before moving to channel 28 in 1958. After Fox acquired the rights to National Football League games in 1994, it began looking for new affiliates in markets where it had none, with South Bend the largest such market. Quincy Newspapers then switched the station from ABC to Fox.

In 2016, Quincy sold the programming rights and Fox affiliation to WSBT-TV, where Fox became a subchannel. Since then, WSJV has broadcast national digital multicast television networks. Gray successfully petitioned the FCC to let it keep WSJV when it acquired Quincy in 2021. WSJV serves as the market&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) host station, with four other commercial stations in the market each broadcasting some of WSJV&#x27;s subchannels in ATSC 1.0 format on its behalf.

==History==
===Truth Publishing Company ownership===
The Truth Publishing Company, publisher of &quot;The Elkhart Truth&quot; and owner of WTRC radio (1340 AM and 100.7 FM), applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a new television station on Elkhart&#x27;s ultra high frequency (UHF) channel 52 in May 1953. The FCC granted the company a construction permit on June 3, 1953, approving the second station in the South Bend–Elkhart area. Construction began in late 1953; the station was located southwest of Elkhart. In November, the station signed to become an affiliate of ABC.

WSJV began broadcasting on March 20, 1954; a test pattern had gone out on March 15 and 16 before the new antenna suffered a fault that required emergency repairs and postponed the planned March 17 sign-on date. Power was increased twelvefold in November when a new transmitter was installed. The station originally aired programs from ABC, NBC, and the DuMont Television Network; NBC affiliated with new WNDU-TV the next year, while DuMont wound down operations.

In 1957, the FCC approved the assignment of lower UHF channels to WSBT-TV (from channel 34 to 22) and WSJV (from channel 52 to 28); it had already allowed WNDU-TV to switch from channel 46 to 16. This required a relocation of UHF channel assignments among several localities in Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. For WSJV, the change also brought a relocation of the tower site from Elkhart to a location near Mishawaka. The channel switch took place on February 14, 1958; it was the last of the three stations to move to the lower channel it was assigned.

After the station invested in purchasing color tape and film equipment, WSJV began broadcasting non-network programs in color in 1966, five years after ABC began airing some of its programs in color in 1961. In 1968, the station bought two color television cameras and began airing all of its locally produced shows in color. Local programs from the station&#x27;s early years included &quot;Kidsville, U.S.A.&quot; and two shows featuring puppet DD Donovan. Truth Publishing also expanded its operation in television by buying WKJG radio and television in Fort Wayne in 1957; the Fort Wayne outlets were sold in 1971. The station group was promoted as the Communicana Group.

===Quincy Newspapers ownership===
In 1974, Truth Publishing sold WSJV for $3.2 million to Quincy Newspapers Inc. (QNI) of Quincy, Illinois; it retained the radio stations, which continued to operate for a time from the same building. At the time, Quincy&#x27;s only television property was WGEM-TV in its home city. The sale earned Truth Publishing a tax certificate from the FCC because it broke up cross-ownership of the South Bend cable system, which was founded by the three major commercial stations in the market. In 1976, the station debuted an 11 p.m. newscast, having previously only broadcast local news at 6 p.m.

On April 3, 1988, the station&#x27;s tower was partially toppled by a windstorm. The station began broadcasting at reduced power the next day, but a replacement mast was not put into service until November.

WSJV began airing weekend newscasts for the first time in its history in 1992; the station had previously only aired weeknight newscasts at 6 and 11 p.m., which news director and 20-year employee Larry Ford believed had severely hurt its local image and contributed to its status as a distant third in Michiana television news. The move came after Don Fuller, a charter station employee who had been general manager for WSJV since 1965, retired that year. Under Ford&#x27;s replacement, Jim Parisi, the station added a 5 p.m. newscast featuring an interactive news format soliciting feedback from viewers by telephone and email, the first such newscast in the United States; Parisi, who co-anchored, could read emails live on air from a computer placed on the news set. The station also debuted a half-hour morning local newscast and sought to increase its presence in areas of the market beyond Elkhart so as to reduce the perception it was &quot;an Elkhart station&quot;.

===Affiliation switch to Fox===

In December 1993, Fox gained the broadcast rights to televise games from the NFL&#x27;s National Football Conference, which firmly established Fox as the fourth national network. After this acquisition, it began a campaign to upgrade its affiliate base. South Bend was the largest market in the United States without a dedicated Fox affiliate; in the 1994 NFL season, CBS affiliate WSBT-TV aired Fox football and lost the rights to air &quot;60 Minutes&quot; as a result.

Quincy signed an agreement with Fox on April 19, 1995, to become a full-time Fox affiliate on October 18 of that year and begin carrying its NFL games sooner. With the other two secular commercial television stations in the market uninterested in switching affiliations, ABC faced the prospect of having cable systems import affiliates from nearby markets. In August, Weigel Broadcasting, which had a South Bend translator for its flagship station, WCIU-TV in Chicago, obtained the rights to the ABC affiliation for South Bend and launched a low-power station, &quot;WBND&quot;, in time for the switch to take place.

In retaliation for Quincy&#x27;s decision to spurn ABC for Fox in South Bend, the network pulled its programming from WREX in Rockford, Illinois, which had recently been acquired by Quincy. ABC moved its Rockford affiliation to WTVO, the previous NBC affiliate in that market; it had recently made a significant investment into WTVO&#x27;s owner, Young Broadcasting.

To coincide with the affiliation switch, WSJV relaunched and shuffled its news offerings. It moved its late news into prime time and saw growing ratings. However, the two-hour morning show, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, failed to attract viewers: originally aired from 6–8 a.m., it moved to 7–9 a.m. in July 1996 to compete against the network morning shows, though it later moved back. This trend continued into the early 2000s; in one Nielsen survey in 2001, WSJV&#x27;s morning newscast drew a fraction of the offerings of its competitor, while 12 percent of households watching TV at the time tuned to WSJV&#x27;s late newscast. This was ascribed to the fewer news resources at channel 28&#x27;s command as well as its location in Elkhart. In 2003, the morning newscast was extended to air for three hours, and an early evening newscast at 5:30 p.m. was introduced; this was the only newscast aired year-round at that time slot in the market, because program schedules changed in the market during daylight saving time.

WSJV began broadcasting a digital signal in October 2002; having been assigned channel 58 by the FCC, its launch forced WBND-LP to move to channel 57. The station shut down its analog signal on February 17, 2009, the original digital television transition date for full-power stations, joining WNDU-TV and WSBT-TV in doing so. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 58, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to channel 28 for post-transition operations.

===Loss of Fox affiliation===
In June and July 2016, the station&#x27;s general manager and news director stepped down and moved to other Quincy Media stations. The &quot;South Bend Tribune&quot; reported the possibility that Quincy was planning to shut down WSJV and consolidate its Fox affiliation onto another station in the market so it could sell WSJV in the FCC&#x27;s then-forthcoming spectrum incentive auction—which would allow stations to relinquish their broadcast spectrum to the FCC in exchange for a share of the profit from its resale to wireless providers as part of a reallocation process. Spectrum was said to be particularly valuable in the South Bend market due to its proximity to several major markets such as Chicago and Indianapolis.

On July 25, 2016, Quincy announced the transfer of the Fox affiliation rights to Sinclair Broadcast Group&#x27;s WSBT-TV in exchange for the ABC and CW affiliations in Peoria, Illinois, from Sinclair-owned WHOI. WSBT then announced that it would replace its two existing subchannels with &quot;Fox Michiana&quot;, beginning on August 1, 2016. For a 60-day transition period until September 30, the new service was simulcast by WSJV to allow viewers and pay television providers time to transition from the former signal.

Along with the transfer, the WSJV newsroom closed down, as the WSBT-TV newsroom was expanded to produce morning and late evening newscasts for Fox Michiana. WSBT-TV hired some of the former WSJV news staff; others went to other Quincy stations. After the transition, the station was reduced to a and became mostly a pass-through for the Heroes &amp; Icons network. Quincy donated the station&#x27;s entire news and tape archive to the Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive; equipment from WSJV was shipped elsewhere in the company.

===Sale to Gray Television===
On February 1, 2021, Gray Television, owner of WNDU-TV, announced its intent to purchase Quincy Media for $925 million in a cash transaction. As WSJV was lower-rated than the top four stations in ratings in the South Bend market (not counting Weigel&#x27;s low-power stations but including WHME-TV), Gray sought a failing station waiver to permit common ownership of both WSJV and WNDU-TV. The sale was completed on August 2.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s subchannels are carried in ATSC 1.0 format on the multiplexed signals of other South Bend-area television stations:
The main subchannels of WNDU-TV, WSBT-TV, WSJV, WNIT, and WHME-TV, plus WSBT-TV&#x27;s Fox subchannel, are broadcast by WSJV in 3.0 format.

<text>KTTC (channel 10) is a television station licensed to Rochester, Minnesota, United States, serving Southeast Minnesota and Northern Iowa as an affiliate of NBC and The CW Plus. It is owned by Gray Media, which provides certain services to Fox affiliate KXLT-TV (channel 47) and Telemundo affiliate KXSH-LD (channel 35) under a shared services agreement (SSA) with SagamoreHill Broadcasting. The stations share studios in Rochester on Bandel Road Northwest along US 52, and also maintain an advertising sales office on Lakeview Drive in Clear Lake, Iowa, that serves Mason City. KTTC&#x27;s transmitter is located south of Ostrander, Minnesota, near the Fillmore–Mower county line.

==History==
The station launched on July 14, 1953, under the call sign KROC-TV, making it the first station in Southern Minnesota and third in the state after KSTP-TV and WTCN-TV in the Twin Cities. It was owned by the Gentling family and their Southern Minnesota Broadcasting Company, and was a sister to KROC radio (AM 1340 and FM 106.9). The station&#x27;s original studios and transmitter were located on Hennessey Hill, west of Rochester. The station carried programming from all four commercial networks of the 1950s: ABC, CBS, and DuMont but was a primary NBC affiliate. The station was launched by G. David Gentling, son of family patriarch Gregory P. Gentling. In November 1966, the station moved to a new building on First Avenue Southwest in Downtown Rochester.

In 1976, due to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) restrictions on ownership of multiple stations in a single market, the station was purchased by Quincy Newspapers from Southern Minnesota Broadcasting. The Gentlings would hold onto the radio stations until 2003. In accordance with an FCC regulation in place then that prohibited TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership groups from sharing the same callsign, channel 10&#x27;s callsign became KTTC on July 1. KTTC-DT began broadcasting on UHF channel 36 in September 2000. The station has been digital-only since February 17, 2009. The station&#x27;s pre-transition digital facility on channel 36 became the final post-transition facility for ABC affiliate KAAL.

In 2001, Quincy bought Shockley Communications (then owner of KXLT). However, Quincy could not buy KXLT due to FCC rules governing duopolies. The FCC does not allow two of the four highest-rated stations to be owned by one company. Additionally, Rochester–Austin–Mason City has only six full-power stations, not enough to legally permit a duopoly in any case. Nevertheless, Quincy took over KXLT&#x27;s operations under a shared services agreement. In 2002, KTTC relocated from its longtime studios on First Avenue Southwest in Downtown Rochester to its current location on Bandel Road in North Rochester, the then-current offices for KXLT. Shockley would later sell the Fox station to SagamoreHill Broadcasting in 2005 which continued the operational agreement with Quincy.

In November 2011, the former KTTC studio on First Avenue SW was demolished to clear the way for the University of Minnesota Rochester&#x27;s future campus. The City of Rochester sold that property and the Fourth Street Boxing Gym and a small halal market were included in the deal. They were also demolished.

On February 1, 2021, Gray Television announced it had purchased Quincy Media for $925 million. KTTC would gain additional sister stations in nearby markets, including CBS/Fox affiliate KEYC-TV in Mankato, ABC affiliate KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids and fellow NBC affiliates KWQC-TV in Davenport and WEAU in Eau Claire, while separating itself from KWWL, WXOW and WQOW which would have to be divested to complete the purchase. The acquisition was completed on August 2, 2021.&quot;

==News operation==

In addition to its main studios, KTTC operates an Austin bureau, within the Riverland Community College campus, on 8th Avenue Northwest.

As of September 2022, KTTC presently broadcasts 28 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday, 3 hours on Saturdays and 2 hours on Sundays).

Through a news share agreement in place since 2001, KTTC produces a half-hour prime time newscast on KXLT seen Sunday through Thursday nights. Known as &quot;Fox 47 News at Nine&quot;, the program originates from a secondary set at the Bandel Road Northwest studios. It features a unique graphics package and news music theme that is different from KTTC. KXLT uses most of this NBC outlet&#x27;s on-air personnel but maintains separate news anchors who can report for KTTC. At some point in 2009, KIMT added the market&#x27;s second prime time local news show at 9 to its MyNetworkTV-affiliated second digital subchannel. This newscast could be seen for a half hour competing with KXLT&#x27;s broadcast. Eventually, the effort would be reduced to a five-minute weather cut-in featuring an updated forecast.

On June 12, 2009, KIMT became the market&#x27;s first television station to upgrade local newscast production to 16:9 enhanced definition widescreen (with some portions in full high definition). Although not truly HD, the aspect ratio matched that of high definition television screens. Video reports from the field were still seen in pillarboxed 4:3 standard definition. It would not be until March 20, 2011, when KTTC performed an upgrade to full high definition newscasts. With the launch to HD came a brand new set and high definition graphics.

On July 28, 2014, KXLT debuted a weekday morning show known as &quot;Fox in the Morning&quot; (that is produced by KTTC). Airing for thirty minutes at 8 a.m., the program was formatted like a magazine with lifestyle, cooking, and style segments although there are local weather updates featured in the show. Eventually, this broadcast may be extended into the 7 o&#x27;clock hour to offer a true local alternative to the national morning programs seen on the big three affiliates. Like the prime time news at 9, the morning program on KXLT maintains separate anchors from KTTC (except for weather segments) and its own graphics scheme.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
KTTC offered Minnesota&#x27;s first full-power digital signal in 2000.

===Former translators===
In the La Crosse area, KTTC&#x27;s analog translator W67CH channel 67 ceased broadcasting on November 4, 2009. It was replaced with digital translator station W50DR-D which went on-the-air at 2:10 in the afternoon on October 14. W50DR-D was subsequently replaced with W34FC-D in August 2018. The translator carried subchannels 10.1 NBC and 10.3 Heroes &amp; Icons, as the other subchannels were duplicated on then-sister station and La Crosse affiliate WXOW 19. Until the launch of the La Crosse digital replacement translator (DRT) of WEAU Eau Claire in the summer of 2020, KTTC&#x27;s La Crosse translator was the only way many area residents could receive NBC over-the-air (due to the area&#x27;s topography). For nearly a year, W34FC-D and WEAU-DRT La Crosse operated simultaneously, offering area viewers two NBC affiliates. This came to an end on August 2, 2021, when W34FC-D was converted to a translator of WECX-LD, a subsidiary WEAU.

KTTC&#x27;s other two analog translators, in Winona (K62EV channel 62) and Blue Earth (K70DR channel 70), both left the air on December 29, 2011, due to the end of broadcasting on channels above 51 (K70DR in particular was one of the few remaining stations still operating on channel 70, which was phased out starting in 1983).

<text>WVVA (channel 6) is a television station licensed to Bluefield, West Virginia, United States, serving the Bluefield–Beckley–Oak Hill market as an affiliate of NBC and The CW Plus. Owned by Gray Media, the station maintains studios on U.S. Route 460 in Bluefield, West Virginia, and its transmitter is located atop East River Mountain, near the West Virginia–Virginia border.

== History ==
The station went on the air on July 31, 1955, as WHIS-TV. It was named in honor of longtime West Virginia politician Hugh Ike Shott, who had died two years earlier. It was owned by the Shott family&#x27;s Daily Telegraph Publishing Company, which owned the &quot;Bluefield Daily Telegraph&quot; along with WHIS radio (1440 AM and 98.7 FM, now WHAJ). Channel 6 signed on under the special commitment of a VHF allotment to Bluefield after the release of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot; in 1952. Because of its proposed antenna height and location on East River Mountain, the channel 6 allocation in Bluefield was short-spaced to WATE-TV (also on channel 6) in Knoxville, Tennessee, and side-spaced to WCYB-TV (on adjacent channel 5) in Bristol, Virginia. As a result, the proposed station on the channel 6 frequency would therefore be limited to one-half of the visual maximum effective radiated power for analog channels 2 through 6, or 50,000 watts.

Unable to obtain a network feed, the Shotts were forced to construct a privately owned microwave relay system to receive NBC programming from WSLS-TV in Roanoke, Virginia, the closest and most accessible city receiving network signals via the AT&amp;T Long Lines system. When it was completed in September WHIS-TV began carrying NBC programs, the first being &quot;The Pinky Lee Show&quot;. The station&#x27;s operations were originally housed in the Bluefield Municipal Building; on January 1, 1967, the WHIS stations moved into new facilities on Big Laurel Highway (US 19–460), known as &quot;Broadcast Center,&quot; and channel 6 began full color operations.

For a long time, the WHIS stations were the only broadcasting outlets in Bluefield. Although the Shotts&#x27; media holdings were considered a monopoly by some (as highlighted in a July 1974 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article), only the newspaper was a vehicle for their conservative political views. But in 1975, the FCC decreed that a single company could not own all of the media outlets in one area, and required several small-market broadcast-print combinations to be broken up by 1980. The Shotts opted to keep the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and the radio stations and sell channel 6. In 1979, after four years of appeals, the Shotts sold WHIS-TV to Quincy, Illinois–based Quincy Newspapers. After the sale was completed, the new owners changed the station&#x27;s call letters to WVVA (so as to comply with an FCC rule in effect at the time that required TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership to use different call letters) on May 1, 1979; the call letters refer to the states that channel 6 serves, West Virginia and Virginia.

On February 17, 2009, WVVA switched to &quot;Digital Nightlight&quot; service on its analog signal showing information on the transition to exclusive digital television and its nightly 6 o&#x27;clock newscast. Post-transition digital operations continued on channel 46, remapping to virtual channel 6. The station&#x27;s analog service was terminated altogether in late-April 2009.

On February 1, 2021, Gray Television announced its intent to purchase Quincy Media for $925 million. The acquisition was completed on August 2, making WVVA sister to Gray stations in nearby markets, including CBS affiliates WDBJ in Roanoke and WDTV in Clarksburg, ABC affiliate WHSV-TV in Harrisonburg and fellow NBC affiliates WSAZ-TV in Huntington–Charleston, WTAP-TV in Parkersburg and WVIR-TV in Charlottesville. This leaves the Wheeling–Steubenville market and the portions of the Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh markets that extend into West Virginia as the only parts of the state not covered by a Gray station (though Washington houses a national political bureau for Gray).

=== WVVA-DT2 ===
From 1995 until late 1998, The WB&#x27;s programming was available in the Beckley–Bluefield–Oak Hill market via WGN-TV&#x27;s national feed. The station launched in late-1998 as a cable-only station with the fictional call sign &quot;WBB&quot;. It was a WB affiliate through The WB 100+ which was a similar operation to the current CW Plus service. &quot;WBB&quot; was identified on-air as &quot;West Virginia&#x27;s WB 18&quot; (based on its channel location on cable). WVVA provided promotional and advertising services for this station. On January 24, 2006, it was announced that The WB and UPN would end broadcasting and merge to form a new combined service, which would be called The CW. The letters would represent the first initial of corporate parents CBS (the parent company of UPN) and the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner.

When The CW launched on September 18, &quot;WBB&quot; was added to a new second digital subchannel of WVVA to offer non-cable subscribers access to the network. At this point, it began using the WVVA-DT2 calls in an official manner. For a few weeks during the summer of 2007, WVVA produced a weeknight prime time newscast at 10 on WVVA-DT2. Airing for thirty minutes, the show featured news anchor Erica Greenway (no longer with station), chief meteorologist Corey Henderson, and sports director P. J. Ziegler (now with WJW in Cleveland). It is unknown why the program was dropped after such a short run.

== Newscasts ==
WVVA remains one of the strongest NBC affiliates in the country and continually averages high Nielsen rating shares in the mountainous nine county market. WVVA began broadcasting local newscasts in high definition from a totally renovated studio with new sets as well as a new control room in June 2012. In addition to its main studios, WVVA operates a Beckley Bureau (on Main Street along North Kanawha Street/WV 210) and a &quot;virtual&quot; Greenbrier Valley Bureau (covering Summers, Monroe, and Greenbrier counties in West Virginia as well as Giles County, Virginia).

==Subchannels==
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WVVA currently has a construction permit for a digital fill-in translator on channel 43 from a transmitter near Layland. This will have the same call sign as the main signal and primarily serve the northern portion of the market.

<text>The Bioinformatics Centre is an interdisciplinary research in bioinformatics at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). The centre is housed in the Section for Computational and RNA Biology at the Department of Biology within the Faculty of Science.

==Programmes==
The Bioinformatics Centre is in charge of a masters program in bioinformatics.

==Organisation==
There are four different subgroups in the center, each focussing on different topics:

* Micro-RNA group: micro-RNA&#x27;s are small RNA molecules with important roles in regulation of gene expression. The group analyses the biology of micro-RNA&#x27;s using computational methods and develop tools that are useful for experimental biologists.
* Non-coding RNA group: Many RNA molecules play a functional role in the cell that is different from the classic role of serving as a template for protein synthesis. The group works on secondary structure prediction and multiple alignment of non-coding RNA&#x27;s.
* Promotor analysis group: The group develops statistical and bioinformatics methods to analyze the regulation of transcription of eukaryotic genes. This includes modelling of epigenetics, transcription factor binding sites, core promoters and transcription start sites
* Structure group: the group develops protein and RNA 3-D structure prediction methods based on graphical models and Bayesian networks, directional statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The group is also a leading area of research into probabilistic programming methods for protein structure prediction.

==People==
The center is headed by Anders Krogh, who pioneered the use of hidden Markov models in bioinformatics, together with David Haussler. The center further consists of six postdocs and about 17 PhD students.

<text>WQOW (channel 18) is a television station in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, United States, serving the Chippewa Valley as an affiliate of ABC. Owned by Allen Media Group, the station has studios on Friedeck Road in Eau Claire, and its transmitter is located in Altoona, Wisconsin.

Although identifying as a separate station in its own right, WQOW is considered a semi-satellite of WXOW (channel 19) in La Crosse. As such, it simulcasts all network and syndicated programming as provided through its parent but airs separate commercial inserts, legal identifications, local newscasts and Sunday morning religious programs, and has its own website. WQOW serves the northern half of the La Crosse–Eau Claire market while WXOW serves the southern portion. The two stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Although WQOW maintains its own facilities, master control and some internal operations are based at the WXOW studios on County Highway 25 in La Crescent, Minnesota. DirecTV and Dish Network offer both WXOW and WQOW as of September 2010.

==History==
WQOW signed-on for the first time on September 22, 1980; the station was originally owned by Liberty Television, which had acquired WXOW two years earlier. For its first decade on-the-air, WXOW had been hampered by an inadequate signal in the northern half of the combined market, and cable viewers watched ABC from the Minneapolis–Saint Paul market (by sign-on, this was KSTP-TV). Unlike the area&#x27;s other stations, WXOW&#x27;s transmitter is located alongside its studios in La Crescent, Minnesota. As a result, viewers in Eau Claire and the Chippewa Valley could only watch the station on cable.

Its original studios were on Business US 53 (Hastings Way) east of the London Square Mall and then-current interchange with WIS 93 on the southeast side of Eau Claire. Originally, WQOW was a straight simulcast of WXOW, except for identifications and commercials. However, since 1982, it has evolved into a more localized station. In 1985, WQOW was acquired by Tak Communications, which would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy six years later. A group of creditors seized Tak&#x27;s assets in 1994, and the company&#x27;s Wisconsin stations were purchased by Shockley Communications in 1995 as part of Tak&#x27;s liquidation.

Since the new US 53 Bypass was set to be constructed on the site of WQOW&#x27;s building, the station moved in January 2001, six months before it was acquired by Quincy Media (then known as Quincy Newspapers). The old building&#x27;s site is located approximately in the northbound lane of the bypass near the WIS 93 northbound bridge. The new building is on WIS 93 immediately south of I-94 on the south side of Eau Claire.

WQOW/WXOW began operating a cable-only affiliate of The WB, known as &quot;WBCZ&quot;, in 1998. It would be replaced with new second digital subchannels (simulcasting The CW) when it launched in the fall of 2006. After The CW Plus national service was upgraded to 720p high definition level in 2012, an HD feed became available on Charter digital channel 610. WQOW began airing solely in digital, effective February 17, 2009, with the analog transmitter operating for sixty additional days broadcasting only local news and information about the digital transition.

In July 2009, Dish Network announced it would add WQOW to its local channel lineup in the Eau Claire area after previously only offering WXOW. WQOW/WXOW launched This TV simulcast on new digital third digital subchannels of the stations in February/March 2010. Following the collapse of WEAU&#x27;s tower on March 22, 2011, WQOW temporarily discontinued This TV on 18.3 in order to provide space to broadcast WEAU temporarily on its subchannel until a new tower was erected. This TV returned to WXOW and WQOW after 10 years in August 2021.

In January 2021, Gray Television announced its intent to purchase Quincy Media for $925 million. As Gray already owns the market&#x27;s WEAU, it planned to keep that station and sell both WQOW and WXOW in order to satisfy FCC requirements. On April 29, Gray announced that WQOW and WXOW would be divested to Allen Media Broadcasting. The sale was completed on August 1; on that day, WEAU assumed the CW and MeTV affiliations from WQOW/WXOW.

==Programming==
WQOW is a part of the Green Bay Packers and WIAA sports networks; the former allows the station to carry Packers preseason games and official team programming, and to brand itself as &quot;Your Official Packers Station&quot; for the Eau Claire market.

===Newscasts===
With the launch of WQOW, WXOW began to simulcast its newscasts on that station; one of the few splits between La Crosse and Eau Claire at launch was that WQOW produced cut-ins during &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. In Eau Claire, reporters were stationed to provide coverage into WXOW&#x27;s regional news, seen in both cities.

In 1982, WQOW established a separate news operation with local newscasts focusing on Eau Claire and the surrounding area. Since it did not operate an in-house weather department of its own, all segments originated from WXOW&#x27;s studios in a tape-delayed arrangement. The effort was canceled in March 1990 as a cost-cutting measure; as a result, WQOW once again began simulcasting WXOW&#x27;s newscasts.

It would not be until October 14, 1996—after the Shockley purchase—when WQOW would relaunch its own local news operation for a second time. Although this incarnation of news production includes a separate weather department from WXOW, meteorologists from that station can fill-in on WQOW (this is the case especially on weekends and for severe weather coverage transitioning between each station&#x27;s coverage area). In September 2011, WXOW became the second television station in the market to perform an upgrade to high definition newscast production. Included in the change was a new studio and updated graphics package. The news department at WQOW was upgraded to HD level at the same time.

<text>WXOW (channel 19) is a television station in La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States, affiliated with ABC and owned by Allen Media Group. The station&#x27;s studios and transmitter are located on County Highway 25 in La Crescent, Minnesota.

WQOW (channel 18) in Eau Claire operates as a semi-satellite of WXOW, extending the ABC signal into the Chippewa Valley of Wisconsin. As such, it simulcasts all network and syndicated programming as provided through WXOW but airs separate commercial inserts, legal identifications, local newscasts and Sunday morning religious programs, and has its own website. WXOW serves the southern half of the La Crosse–Eau Claire market while WQOW serves the northern portion. The two stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Although WQOW maintains its own studios on Friedeck Road in Eau Claire, master control and some internal operations are based at WXOW&#x27;s facilities. DirecTV and Dish Network offer both WXOW and WQOW as of September 2010.

==History==
WXOW signed on on March 7, 1970, as a semi-satellite of WKOW-TV in Madison, which was owned by Horizon Communications at the time. Before then, ABC programming in the market was relegated to off-hours clearances on CBS affiliate WKBT (channel 8) and NBC affiliate WEAU (channel 13). Depending on the location, Western Wisconsin viewers could get the full ABC schedule on KMSP-TV (now a Fox O&amp;O) from the Twin Cities, KAUS-TV (now KAAL) in Austin, Minnesota, or WKOW.

For its first decade on the air, WXOW&#x27;s UHF signal was marginal at best in Eau Claire, primarily because its transmitter was located in Minnesota. As a result, Chippewa Valley viewers only got a decent signal from the station when cable arrived in the market in the mid-1970s. In order to solve this reception problem, WXOW severed the electronic umbilical cord with WKOW and signed on WQOW as a full-time satellite on September 22, 1980, two years after the station was sold to Liberty Television. Tak Communications purchased Liberty Television&#x27;s Wisconsin-based stations in 1985. In 1991, Tak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; it would be taken over by a group of creditors less than three years later. This resulted in the sale of Tak&#x27;s Wisconsin stations to Shockley Communications in 1995.

WXOW and WQOW began operating a cable-only affiliate of The WB in 1998 known as &quot;WBCZ&quot;. This was seen through a simulcast on channel 15 on most cable systems in La Crosse and Eau Claire. In June 2001, Quincy Newspapers (later Quincy Media) announced that it would acquire Shockley Communications. In September 2002, WXOW became the first La Crosse area television station to broadcast in digital on UHF channel 14. WXOW and WQOW replaced &quot;WBCZ&quot; with new second digital subchannels (simulcasting The CW) when the new network launched in the fall of 2006.

After The CW Plus national feed was upgraded to 720p high-definition level in fall 2012, an HD feed became available on Charter digital channel 610. Up until August 2018, there were two different signals from the same tower at WXOW&#x27;s studios carrying The CW as a digital translator of sister station KTTC also carried a CW subchannel in high definition.

WXOW began airing solely in digital effective February 17, 2009, with the analog transmitter operating for 60 additional days broadcasting as part of a &quot;nightlight&quot; service with local news and information about the digital transition. On June 11, 2009, WXOW moved from its initial digital channel assignment to channel 48 at a higher broadcasting power. WXOW and WQOW launched This TV (simulcast on new third digital subchannels of the stations) in February–March 2010. WXOW had a construction permit to air a digital fill-in translator covering Tomah, Wisconsin. Airing on UHF channel 28, this low-powered signal would have had a transmitter on Echo Road in western unincorporated Monroe County. The permit was canceled on June 6, 2013.

In January 2021, Gray Television announced its intent to purchase Quincy Media for $925 million. As Gray already owns the market&#x27;s WEAU, it planned to keep that station and sell both WXOW and WQOW in order to satisfy FCC requirements. On April 29, Gray announced that WXOW and WQOW would be divested to Allen Media Broadcasting. The sale was completed on August 2; on that day, WEAU assumed the CW and MeTV affiliations from WXOW/WQOW.

==Programming==
WXOW is a part of the Green Bay Packers and WIAA sports networks; the former allows the station to carry Packers preseason games and official team programming, and to brand itself as &quot;Your Official Packers Station&quot; for the La Crosse market.

===Newscasts===

In October 1996, WQOW relaunched its local news operation for a second time, which remains to this day. Although this incarnation of news production includes a separate weather department from WXOW, meteorologists from that station can fill-in on WQOW. In September 2011, WXOW became the second television station in the market to perform an upgrade to high definition newscast production.

<text>WAOW (channel 9) is a television station in Wausau, Wisconsin, United States, affiliated with ABC and owned by Allen Media Group. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Grand Avenue/US 51 in Wausau, and its transmitter is located on Rib Mountain.

WAOW relays its signal on satellite station [[WMOW]] (channel 4) in Crandon, extending its range in the northeastern reaches of the market.

==History==
WAOW signed on the air on May 7, 1965. Owned by Mid-Continent Broadcasting, it served as a satellite station of Madison&#x27;s WKOW as part of the Wisconsin Television Network which would later include WXOW in La Crosse and WQOW in Eau Claire. Midcontinent Broadcasting sold the stations to Horizon Communications in 1970. Liberty Television bought the stations in 1978. This station gradually increased its local programming and content, finally severing the electronic umbilical cord with WKOW in the 1980s.

In 1985, Liberty Television sold the Wisconsin stations to Tak Communications. Tak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991 and would be taken over by a group of creditors less than three years later. In 1995, Shockley Communications purchased WAOW along with three sister stations (WKOW, WXOW, and WQOW) from Tak&#x27;s creditors. Quincy Newspapers purchased most of the Shockley stations, including its Wisconsin sister stations in June 2001.

Between 1994 and 1999, WAOW carried the Fox network&#x27;s National Football League game package, which featured most games of the home state Green Bay Packers. The arrangement was necessary due to a lack of a local, over-the-air Fox affiliate in the Wausau–Rhinelander market. (Area cable systems primarily carried Fox through the Foxnet service or through Green Bay&#x27;s WGBA-TV or WLUK-TV.) WAOW&#x27;s arrangement with Fox came to an end in December 1999, when the Wittenberg-licensed WFXS (channel 55) signed on to become Central Wisconsin&#x27;s first full-time Fox station.

On June 25, 2002, WAOW became the first commercial television station in the Wausau–Rhinelander market to broadcast in high-definition; WYOW would join them on October 24.

WAOW/WYOW converted fully to digital on February 17, 2009, without a nightlight period for WAOW while WYOW converted after a nightlight period. The two stations carried the Retro Television Network (RTV) on a third digital subchannel until March 2009. In the beginning of that month, it was replaced with This TV. On September 1, 2015, Decades replaced This TV.

In February and March, WAOW aired WFXS&#x27; digital signal temporarily on DT3 while that station ironed out problems with the activation of its digital transmitter. In early September 2009, WFXS added RTV to its third digital subchannel.

On January 7, 2021, Quincy Media announced that it had put itself up for sale. On February 1, Gray Television announced it would purchase Quincy&#x27;s radio and TV properties for $925 million. As Gray already owned WSAW-TV in the Wausau–Rhinelander market, and both that station and WAOW rank among the market&#x27;s top four stations, it agreed to sell WAOW in order to satisfy FCC requirements.

On April 29, Gray announced that WAOW and WMOW would be divested to Allen Media Broadcasting in a $380 million deal that includes, among other Quincy-owned stations, WKOW/Madison, WXOW/La Crosse, and WQOW/Eau Claire. Gray, however, kept WYOW, and converted the Eagle River station into a full-power satellite of WSAW-TV, airing The CW on its main 34.1 channel and simulcasting CBS &amp; Fox on subchannels 7.10 and 33.10, respectively.

==News operation==

In 2000, WAOW entered into a news share agreement with WFXS (owned by Davis Television, LLC). The arrangement resulted in a weeknight prime time newscast debuting on the Fox outlet. The broadcast, known as &quot;Fox 55 News at 9&quot;, could be seen for thirty minutes.

Although there was no weekend edition of the show, it was eventually joined by a weekday morning newscast (also produced by WAOW) on April 23, 2012. Known as &quot;Fox 55 This Morning&quot;, this program aired for an hour (from 7 to 8 a.m.) on WFXS offering a local alternative to the national morning programs seen on the big three networks. Both WFXS newscasts maintained a separate music package and graphics scheme from WAOW. The broadcasts originated from the ABC outlet&#x27;s primary set at its studios but with unique duratrans indicating the Fox-branded shows. On June 19, 2011, WAOW became the market&#x27;s second television outlet to upgrade local news to a high definition level. Included in the change were a redesigned set and an updated graphics scheme. Eventually, in 2012, WFXS made the transition to HD newscasts.

On July 1, 2015, concurrent with the Fox affiliation moving to low-power WZAW-LD, both of the Fox-branded newscasts were canceled after the news share arrangement was terminated. Almost a week later (on July 6), WAOW introduced its own prime time news at 9 (airing weeknights for a half-hour) on its CW digital subchannel. This broadcast, known as &quot;Newsline 9 at 9 on The CW&quot;, can also be seen through a simulcast on WMOW&#x27;s main channel and WYOW-DT2.

Since the station went on the air in 1965, it has maintained a weather beacon in the form of a sign or tower that is lit in various colors to convey the forecast for the next 12 to 24 hours. The &quot;9&quot; sign on the side of the WAOW studios currently serves this purpose. A poem created by a viewer contest helps to remember the meaning of the colors:

:When the Weather 9 is red; warmer weather is ahead.
:When the Weather 9 is green; cooler weather is foreseen.
:When the Weather 9 is white; little change is in sight.
:When the Weather 9 is flashing by night or day; precipitation is on the way.

==Subchannels==
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
==Satellite stations==
In addition to its main signal, WAOW operates one satellite station that provides additional coverage and some overlap. The station formerly operated WYOW which was sold to Gray Television in 2021.

===WMOW===

WMOW (channel 4) in Crandon operates as a full-time satellite of WAOW. Besides its transmitter, WMOW does not maintain any physical presence locally in Crandon.

In mid-February 2009, Quincy announced the purchase of Crandon-based WBIJ, a FamilyNet affiliate, which was sold to Quincy by the widow of the station&#x27;s founder. Plans called for the conversion of the station to a second satellite of WAOW to serve the northeastern portion of the market near the Michigan border after completing the station&#x27;s digital VHF channel 12 transmitter facilities. Quincy has since renamed the station WMOW to conform with the call letters of WAOW and the remainder of Quincy&#x27;s network of ABC affiliates throughout the state which all carry a &quot;OW&quot; suffix. Quincy put WMOW on the air June 4, 2010.

===WYOW===
WYOW (channel 34) in Eagle River operated as a semi-satellite of WAOW serving Rhinelander. As such, it simulcast all network and syndicated programming as provided through its parent, but aired separate legal identifications and local commercial inserts. However, this slightly different feed was seen exclusively over the air as only WAOW had been offered on cable and satellite providers in the market. Although WYOW maintained an advertising sales office on West Pine Street/WIS 17/WIS 70 in Eagle River and transmitter facilities in unincorporated Oneida County (between Sugar Camp and Three Lakes), master control and most internal operations were based at WAOW&#x27;s studios. WYOW was identified on-air as &quot;Northwoods 34&quot; based on north-central Wisconsin&#x27;s namesake as a popular vacation and retirement destination in the Upper Midwestern United States. It also serves the western portion of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula although the off-air signal reach is limited to areas around Iron River and Watersmeet.

WYOW&#x27;s first broadcast to viewers in Northern Wisconsin and the Western Upper Peninsula of Michigan was on January 4, 1997, under the ownership of Northwoods Educational Television. Shockley operated the station through a local marketing agreement (LMA) until Shockley successfully purchased it outright in December 1998.

WYOW did not maintain any news-related personnel at its Eagle River office. However, there was a specific section on WAOW&#x27;s website featuring &quot;Northwoods 34&quot; branded headlines as provided through WAOW&#x27;s regional coverage.

As of August 2021, the station is owned by Gray Television and rebroadcasts WSAW-TV.

<doc id="647603" wikidata="Q754800" url="?curid=647603" title="Vickers machine gun">
<text>The Vickers machine gun or Vickers gun is a water-cooled .303 British (7.7 mm) machine gun produced by Vickers Limited, originally for the British Army. The gun was operated by a three-man crew but typically required more men to move and operate it: one fired, one fed the ammunition, the others helped to carry the weapon, its ammunition, and spare parts. It was in service from before the First World War until the 1960s, with air-cooled versions of it on many Allied World War I fighter aircraft.

The weapon had a reputation for great solidity and reliability. Ian V. Hogg, in &quot;Weapons &amp; War Machines&quot;, describes an action that took place in August 1916, during which the British 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps fired their ten Vickers guns to deliver sustained fire for twelve hours. Using 100 barrels, they fired a million rounds without breakdowns. &quot;It was this absolute foolproof reliability which endeared the Vickers to every British soldier who ever fired one. It never broke down; it just kept on firing and came back for more.&quot;

==History==

The Vickers machine gun was based on the successful Maxim gun of the late 19th century. After purchasing the Maxim company outright in 1896, Vickers took the design of the Maxim gun and improved it, inverting the mechanism as well as reducing its weight by lightening and simplifying the action and using high strength alloys for certain components. A muzzle booster was also added.

The British Army formally adopted the Vickers gun as its standard machine gun under the name &quot;Gun, Machine, Mark I, Vickers, .303-inch&quot; on 26 November 1912. There were shortages when the First World War began, and the British Expeditionary Force was still equipped with Maxims when sent to France in 1914. Vickers was threatened with prosecution for war profiteering, due to the exorbitant price demanded for each gun. As a result, the price was much reduced. As the war progressed, and numbers increased, it became the British Army&#x27;s primary machine gun, and was used on all fronts during the conflict.

When the Lewis Gun was adopted as a light machine gun and issued to infantry units, the Vickers guns were redefined as heavy machine guns, withdrawn from infantry units, and grouped in the hands of the new Machine Gun Corps (when heavier 0.5 in/12.7 mm calibre machine guns appeared, the tripod-mounted, rifle-calibre machine guns such as the Vickers were further re-classified as &quot;medium machine guns&quot;). After the First World War, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) was disbanded and the Vickers returned to infantry units.

Before the Second World War, there were plans to replace the Vickers gun as part of a widescale change from rimmed to rimless rounds; one of the contenders was the 7.92mm Besa machine gun (British-built Czech ZB-53 design), which eventually became the British Army&#x27;s standard tank-mounted machine gun. However, the Vickers remained in service with the British Army until 30 March 1968. Its last operational use was in the Radfan during the Aden Emergency. Its successor in UK service is the British L7 variant of the FN MAG general purpose machine gun.

===Use in aircraft===

In 1913, a Vickers machine gun was mounted on the experimental Vickers E.F.B.1 biplane, which was probably the world&#x27;s first purpose-built combat aeroplane. However, by the time the production version, the Vickers F.B.5, had entered service the following year, the armament had been changed to a Lewis gun.

During World War I, the Vickers gun became a standard weapon on British and French military aircraft, especially after 1916, initially in a single gun configuration (Nieuport 17, SPAD VII, Sopwith Triplane), increased to a twin-gun standard in later war fighters (Nieuport 28, SPAD XIII, Sopwith Camel), with exceptions such as the S.E.5, which had a single synchronized Vickers and a Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing. Although heavier than the Lewis, its closed bolt firing cycle made it much easier to synchronise to allow it to fire through aircraft propellers. The belt feed was enclosed right up to the gun&#x27;s feed-way to inhibit the effect of wind. Steel disintegrating-link ammunition belts were perfected in the UK by William de Courcy Prideaux in mid-war and became standard for aircraft guns thereafter. From 1917 to 1919, French Manufacture d&#x27;armes de Châtellerault produced under license .303 Vickers machine guns (240 were delivered before the Armistice) but most of the French aircraft Vickers machine guns were British-made.

By 1917 it had been determined that standard rifle calibre cartridges were less satisfactory for shooting down observation balloons than larger calibres carrying incendiary or tracer bullets; the Vickers machine gun was chambered in the 11mm Vickers round, known as the &quot;Vickers aircraft machine gun&quot; and sometimes the &quot;Balloon Buster&quot;, and was adopted by the Allies as a standard anti-balloon armament, used by both the British and French in this role until the end of the war.

The famous Sopwith Camel and the SPAD XIII types used twin synchronized Vickers, as did most British and French fighters between 1918 and the mid-1930s. In the air, the weighty water-cooling system was rendered redundant by low temperatures at high altitude and the constant stream of air passing over the gun (and lack of any need for sustained fire such as employed by ground troops); but because the weapon relied on boosted barrel recoil, the (empty) water-holding barrel jacket or casing was retained. Several sets of louvered slots were cut into the barrel jacket to aid air cooling, a better solution than that which had initially been attempted with the 1915-vintage lMG 08 German aircraft ordnance.

In 1918 the slotted modified original barrel jacket was replaced with a slimmer jacket on the Mk. II version, and in 1927 a muzzle flash suppressor was added on the Mk. II*.

As the machine gun armament of US and UK fighter aircraft moved from the fuselage to the wings in the years before World War II, the Vickers was generally replaced by the faster-firing and more reliable Browning Model 1919 using metal-linked cartridges. The Gloster Gladiator was the last RAF fighter to be armed with the Vickers, later replaced by Brownings. The Fairey Swordfish was fitted with the weapon until production ended in August 1944.

Several British bombers and attack aircraft of the Second World War mounted the Vickers K machine gun or VGO, a completely different design, resembling the Lewis gun in external appearance.

Vickers machine guns, designated as models E (pilot&#x27;s) and F (observer&#x27;s, fed from a pan magazine) were also used among others in Poland, where 777 of them were converted to 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge in 1933–1937.

===Use in armored vehicles===
The water-cooled Vickers Mark VI, Mark VI* and Mark VII were versions of the Mark I for use in tanks. They were introduced in 1936 and declared obsolete in 1944 (though they and the vehicles they were installed in were still in reserve use until the 1960s). They could be installed with either a left-hand or right-hand feed block. The Mark VI and VI* Tank Patterns were conversions of old stock Mark Is while the Mark VII Tank Pattern was new production. 

===Variants===
The larger calibre (half-inch) version of the Vickers was used on armoured fighting vehicles and naval vessels. The &quot;Gun, Machine, Vickers, .5-inch, Mk. II&quot; was used in tanks, the earlier Mark I having been the development model. This entered service in 1933 and was obsolete in 1944. Firing either single shot or automatic it had a pistol type trigger grip rather than the spades of the 0.303 in (7.7 mm) weapon.

The &quot;Gun, Machine, Vickers, .5-inch, Mk. III&quot; was used as an anti-aircraft gun on British ships. This variation was typically four guns mounted on a 360° rotating and (+80° to −10°) elevating housing. The belts were rolled into a spiral and placed in hoppers beside each gun. The heavy plain bullet weighed and was good for range. Maximum rate of fire for the Mark III was about 700 rpm from a 200-round belt carried in a drum.
They were fitted from the 1920s onwards, but in practical terms, proved of little use.
During the Second World War, the naval 0.5 in (12.7 mm) version was also mounted on power-operated turrets in smaller watercraft, such as Motor Gun Boats and Motor Torpedo Boats.

The Mark IV and V guns were improvements on the Mark II. Intended for British light tanks, some were used during the war on mounts on trucks by the Long Range Desert Group in the North Africa Campaign.

The Vickers machine gun was produced, between the wars, as the vz.09 machine gun.

===Foreign service===

The Vickers was widely sold commercially and saw service with many nations and their own particular ammunition. It was also modified for each country and served as a base for many other weapons. For example:
* 6.5×52mm Mannlicher–Carcano
* 6.5×50mmSR Arisaka
* 6.5×53mmR
* 7×57mm Mauser
* .280 British
* 7.5×55mm Swiss
* 7.62×51mm NATO
* .30-06 Springfield
* 7.62×54mmR
* 7.65×53mm Argentine
* 7.7×58mm Arisaka (licensed as the &quot;fixed type&quot; Type 89 machine gun)
* 8mm Lebel (2,000 ordered by France in 1914 but only 52 delivered)

====Service after World War II====
The Union of South Africa retained a large inventory of surplus Vickers machine guns after World War II. Many of these were donated to the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) during the Angolan Civil War. Angolan militants were usually trained in their use by South African advisers. Small quantities re-chambered for 7.62 mm NATO ammunition remained in active service with the South African Defence Force until the mid-1980s, when they were all relegated to reserve storage. Six were withdrawn from storage and reused by a South African liaison team operating with UNITA during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, after which the weapons were finally retired.

In the mid-1960s, the Vickers machine gun remained in service in countries such as India, Israel and Egypt. It saw action with the Ceylon Army in the 1971 JVP insurrection.

====Colt–Vickers M1915====

By the early 1900s, the U.S. military had a mixed collection of automatic machine guns in use that included M1895 &quot;potato diggers&quot;, 287 M1904 Maxims, 670 M1909 Benét–Mercié guns, and 353 Lewis machine guns. In 1913, the U.S. began to search for a superior automatic weapon. One of the weapons considered was the British Vickers machine gun.

Field tests were conducted of the Vickers in 1914, and the gun was unanimously approved by the board for the army under the designation &quot;Vickers Machine Gun Model of 1915, Caliber .30, Water-Cooled&quot;. One hundred twenty-five guns were ordered from Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company in 1915, with an additional 4,000 ordered the next year, all chambered for .30-06. Design complexities, design modifications, and focus on producing previously ordered weapons meant that when the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917, Colt had not manufactured a single M1915.

Production began in late 1917 with shipments to the Western Front in mid-1918. The first twelve divisions to reach France were given French Hotchkiss M1914 machine guns, and the next ten had M1915s. The next twelve divisions were to have Browning M1917 machine guns, but there was a shortage of parts. By August 1918, thirteen U.S. divisions were armed with the Colt–Vickers machine gun, and many aircraft were armed with the weapons as well (2,888 guns were converted). 7,653 guns were issued during the war out of 12,125 produced in total. War damage losses reduced the number of M1915s in the U.S. Army inventory from 9200+ to about 8,000 total.
After World War I, the Colt–Vickers machine guns were kept in reserve until World War II. Several hundred were sent to the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines, and were all eventually lost to enemy action. In 1940 and 1941, a total of 7,071 M1915 guns were purchased by the United Kingdom to re-equip their forces after the Dunkirk evacuation, which depleted the weapon from the U.S. inventory before their entry into the war. Because the M1915 Colt–Vickers was not chambered for the standard British .303, it was painted with a red band to differentiate it and restricted it to Home Guard use.

==Specifications==
The weight of the gun itself varied based on the gear attached, but was generally with a tripod. The ammunition boxes for the 250-round ammunition belts weighed each. In addition, it required about of water in its evaporative cooling system to prevent overheating. The heat of the barrel boiled the water in the jacket surrounding it. The resulting steam was taken off by a flexible tube to a condenser container—this had the dual benefits of avoiding giving away the gun&#x27;s location, and also enabling re-use of the water, which was very important in arid environments.

In British service, the Vickers gun fired the standard .303 inch cartridges used in the Lee–Enfield rifle, which generally had to be hand-loaded into the cloth ammunition belts. There was also a 0.5 in calibre version used as an anti-aircraft weapon and various other calibres produced for foreign buyers.

The gun was long and its cyclic rate of fire was between 450 and 600 rounds per minute. In practice, it was expected that 10,000 rounds would be fired per hour, and that the barrel would be changed every hour—a two-minute job for a trained team. The Vickers gun could sustain fire for long durations of time exceeding the recommended 10,000 rounds an hour due to the water-cooled barrel and hourly barrel swaps. One account states that a Vickers fired just under 5 million rounds in a week as a test in 1963 at Strensall Barracks and was still operable. The muzzle velocity was ± with Mark VII(z) ammunition and with Mark VIIIz ammunition. The Mark VIIIz cartridge, which had a boat-tailed spitzer &#x27;streamlined&#x27; bullet, could be used against targets at a range of approximately . The bullet jackets were generally made of an alloy of cupro-nickel, and gilding metal. Ammunition for the Vickers used colour-coded annuli. Tracer ammunition was marked with a red annulus; armouring-piercing ammunition with a green annulus, and incendiary ammunition with a blue annulus. Explosive ammunition was marked with an orange annulus before the Second World War and was changed to black.

==Use==

The gun and its tripod were carried separately and both were heavy. The Vickers Mk I was 30 lb (13.6 kg) without the water and tripod, and weighed 40 lb (18.1 kg) with the water. The original design did not anticipate it being carried up jungle-covered mountains on men&#x27;s backs, but such was the weapon&#x27;s popularity that men were generally content to pack it to all manner of difficult locations. The tripod would be set up to make a firm base, often dug into the ground a little and perhaps with the feet weighted down with sandbags.

The water jacket would be filled with about of water from a small hole at the rear end, sealed by a cap. The evaporative cooling system, though heavy, was very effective and enabled the gun to keep firing far longer than its air-cooled rival weapons. If water was unavailable, soldiers were known to resort to using their urine. It was sometimes claimed that crews would fire off a few rounds simply to heat their gun&#x27;s cooling water to make tea, despite the resulting brew tasting of machine-oil. In extremely cold weather, the cooling water could freeze and damage the gun. This problem was addressed using an insulating water jacket cover, introduced in 1918 but still in use during the Korean War. Some crews added vehicle antifreeze, others drained the water jacket, or simply fired a few rounds periodically to keep the water from freezing.

The loader sat to the gunner&#x27;s right, and fed in belts of cloth, into which the rounds had been placed. The weapon would draw in the belt from right to left, pull the next round out of the belt and into the chamber, fire it, then send the fired brass cartridge down and out of the receiver while the cloth belt would continue out the left side. During sustained fire, the barrel would heat up which heated the water in the jacket until hot enough for the water to evaporate or boil thereby cooling the barrel releasing the heat through steam. It took the Mk I 600 rounds of continuous fire to boil the water in the jacket, evaporating at a rate of 1.5 pints (0.852 L) per 1,000 rounds. The steam would reach the top of the jacket and enter a steam tube which led to a port that was situated under the jacket near the muzzle. A hose was connected to this, which released the steam into a metal water can allowing it to be vented away from the rest of the gun hiding the steam cloud and the gun&#x27;s position. This also allowed any condensate to be reclaimed from the steam. Before the can got too full, it would be emptied back into the jacket to replenish the water level which would have fallen as the water evaporated and boiled away. If the water jacket needed to be emptied, a plug under the jacket could be unscrewed to drain the entire jacket.
The Vickers was used for indirect fire against enemy positions at ranges up to with Mark VIIIz ammunition. This plunging fire was used to great effect against road junctions, trench systems, forming up points, and other locations that might be observed by a forward observer, or zeroed in at one time for future attacks, or guessed at by men using maps and experience. Sometimes a location might be zeroed in during the day, and then attacked at night, much to the surprise and confusion of the enemy. New Zealand units were especially fond of this use. A white disc would be set up on a pole near the MMG, and the gunner would aim at a mark on it, knowing that this corresponded to aiming at the distant target. There was a special back-sight with a tall extension on it for this purpose. The only similar weapon of the time to use indirect fire was the German MG 08, which had a separate attachment sight with range calculator.

A British World War II Vickers medium machine gun platoon typically had one officer in command of four guns, in two sections of two, each with a crew and a small team of riflemen whose job was to protect the gun and keep it supplied with ammunition.

==Operating mechanism==
The Vickers is a fully automatic belt-fed firearm which is fired from a closed bolt. When ready to fire, a round is in the chamber and the breechblock assembly and working parts are forward. It has a recoil operated, floating action with a toggle lock similar to a Luger pistol. However, unlike the Luger, the mechanism is totally contained within the receiver or body of the Vickers. When operated, the floating action, which consists of the barrel, breechblock assembly and toggle mechanism, reciprocate as a unit within the body of the gun. The mechanism is held together by recoiling plates, that connect the breech end of the barrel to the rear of the toggle mechanism. The breech is locked closed when the toggle is straight. The crank cocking handle is part of the floating action. It acts through the rear pivot of the toggle lock. Pulling the cocking handle causes the toggle to rise. This unlocks the breech and then draws the breechblock assembly rearward. While firing, the opposite end of the crank handle cams on a round lug fixed to the body. Rearward movement of the floating action tips the cocking handle and unlocks the toggle. The recoil that unlocks the toggle is gas assisted. Propellent gases leaving the muzzle are partly contained within the muzzle cap and act on the muzzle cup (attached to the barrel) to assist in propelling the floating action rearward to the point where the toggle mechanism is unlocked. The breechblock assembly then opens fully while opposed by a spring which ultimately returns it to the closed position. The spring under tension acts on a crank mounted on the opposite side of the body to the cocking handle.

The feed block assembly sits directly above the breech. It accepts the canvas belt loaded with ammunition. With each firing cycle, it advances the belt by one round so that a fresh cartridge is presented ready for loading. The belt is advanced by pawls which move from side to side. The pawls are operated by a linkage that engages with the floating action. A second set of spring-loaded pawls tilt up and down as the belt passes over them. These hold the belt during the return cycle of the feed pawls.

The breechblock assembly is roughly as high as the receiver of the gun. On its front face is the extractor block. Levers cause this to move up and down as the action is cycled. It has a slot with two grooves which allow the rim of the cartridge to be held from each side, much like a stripper clip does. With the breechblock assembly closed and ready to fire, the extractor block grips the base of two cartridges: the lower cartridge in the chamber ready to fire and an upper cartridge held in the canvas belt within the feed block. When the breechblock assembly unlocks after firing, the extractor pulls the spent cartridge from the chamber and, once clear, this falls through an ejection port in the underside of the gun&#x27;s body. Unlocking the breechblock assembly also withdraws the upper round (the next round to be chambered) from the belt. When there is sufficient clearance, the extractor block lowers the new round until it is aligned with the chamber. Forward movement of the breechblock assembly then chambers the round. Near the very end of the forward cycle, the extractor block rises to engage the next round ready to be loaded.

The breechblock assembly houses the firing pin and trigger mechanism. The firing pin, under spring tension, strikes the primer of the cartridge through a hole in the extractor block. It must therefore be retracted before the extractor block moves down as part of the loading cycle. Once retracted, the firing pin is held in a cocked position by a sear, ready for the next firing cycle. As the breechblock assembly fully closes on the breech, the sear disengages but the firing pin is held rearward by the trigger. The end of the trigger protrudes from the top of the breechblock assembly.

To fire the loaded gun, the gunner depresses a paddle at the rear of the gun. Through a lever, this pulls on a sliding bar that trips the trigger to release the firing pin. The weapon then cycles to load the next cartridge for firing. If the paddle is still depressed when the breech closes, the trigger is tripped again and a further firing cycle occurs.

<text>The Center for Planetary Research at the University of Copenhagen was created in February 2001 when the planetary science groups from the Niels Bohr Institute (Danish: Niels Bohr Institutet) (also known as Niels Bohr Institute for Astronomy, Physics and Geophysics; short &quot;NBIfAFG&quot;) and the Danish Space Research Institute (DSRI) [Danish: Dansk Rumforskningsinstitut, short &quot;DRI&quot; or &quot;DRKI&quot;] were merged. It no longer existed in August 2011. Together with associated national and international groups it aimed to strengthen planetary research in Denmark and to provide a platform for the education of planetary researchers. It spanned a broad range of disciplines from astronomy, physics, geophysics, and space instrumentation to geology and biology.

== Purposes ==
The purposes were:
* To gather and develop initiatives in planetary science
* To participate internationally in planetary science missions through development of instruments for ESA and NASA missions
* To use existing and ongoing observations to model the conditions on the planets, moons, asteroids, and meteorites, thereby gaining knowledge on their formation, evolution, and present conditions.
* To create an active, international research environment.

==Partnerships==
The Center for Planetary Research was partnered with 3 institutes, the Natural History Museum of Denmark, the Niels Bohr Institute and the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The engage in research and information exchange, with the Center of Planetary Research acting as part of the University of Copenhagen. Research at the institute if funded in part by the Danish National Research Foundation and the Natural History Museum of Denmark.

<text>Michael Francis Flynn (December 20, 1947 – September 30, 2023) was an American science fiction author. Nearly all of Flynn&#x27;s work falls under the category of hard science fiction, although his treatment of it can be unusual since he applied the rigor of hard science fiction to &quot;softer&quot; sciences such as sociology in works such as &quot;In the Country of the Blind&quot;. Much of his short fiction appeared in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Flynn was born in Easton, Pennsylvania to his parents, Joseph and Rita (Singley) Flynn. He had a brother, Dennis, who died in childhood. Flynn attended and graduated from Notre Dame High School, then located in Bethlehem Township.

He earned a B.A. in mathematics from La Salle University in Easton, and an M.S. in topology from Marquette University in Milwaukee. He began but did not complete a Ph.D at the University of Colorado Boulder.

==Career==
Prior to become a science fiction author, he was employed as an industrial quality engineer and statistician with Coors Container Corporation and Stat-A-Matrix/Oriel.

<doc id="647616" wikidata="Q604220" url="?curid=647616" title="South Manitou Island">
<text>South Manitou Island ( ) is located in Lake Michigan, approximately west of Leland, Michigan. It is part of Leelanau County and the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The uninhabited island is in land area and can be accessed by a ferry service from Leland. Guided tours on open-air vehicles are available to visitors, but most traffic is on foot. Larger North Manitou Island lies to its north.

The island is wide and long. It is part of an island chain that extends north to the Straits of Mackinac. The island consists of a ridge of tilted layers of limestone, buried under a blanket of glacial debris. Glaciers carved out the Lake Michigan basin. When the basin filled with water, the peaks of the ridge remained exposed as islands. During post-glacial times, winds blowing on the high, sandy bluffs on the west side of the island moved sand inland, forming sand dunes. Florence Lake is the island&#x27;s only inland lake. The island has a system of trails and campsites.

A growth of Northern white cedars on the southwestern corner of the island are among the oldest and largest in the world. The largest is around and is estimated to be over 500 years old.

==History==

South Manitou Island was originally settled in the mid-1830s by William Burton to provide cord wood to fuel the Great Lakes steamships. His dock was built in the middle of the crescent-shaped bay on the eastern side of the island, which offered the only natural deep-water harbor between Chicago and Buffalo. In 1847, the village included Burton&#x27;s Wharf, a house, blacksmith shop, grocery store, barn, and a wooden tamarack railroad track extending from the dock inland to haul wood for the steamers. When the first post office opened in 1870, it was located here. When logging operations ended and the dock fell into disrepair, the original island village dwindled in size and importance. Burdick&#x27;s moved their general store from its original location near the old dock to a site near the Lifesaving station in 1923 on the southeastern shore, and that marked the shift of the island community to the current village site located at the present dock where the passenger ferry arrives.

Farming developed slowly on the island, but by 1870 most islanders were self-sufficient farmers. Surplus crops were sold to passing ships and mainland markets. The isolation of the island provided an ideal environment for growing prize-winning rye, beans and peas. Today, there are no active farms on the island; farm buildings, abandoned machinery, the old school and cemetery are reminders of the past. The island is now uninhabited, and most of its buildings lie in ruins.

==Lighthouse and Life-Saving Service Station==
South Manitou Island was popular in the 19th and 20th centuries as a harbor and fueling station. With the completion of the Erie Canal in 1826, the development of commercial navigation on the Great Lakes increased rapidly. The Manitou Passage was the most important route for schooners and steamers traveling the 300 mile length of Lake Michigan. The island was a stop for early mariners between Chicago and the Straits of Mackinac.


To guide storm-driven ships, Congress appropriated $5,000 in 1838 for the construction of a lighthouse. Construction began in 1839, but very little is known about this first lighthouse on South Manitou Island. The specifications were the same as for the Old Presque Isle lighthouse, which included a 30-foot circular tower and a stone keeper&#x27;s dwelling, but written accounts describe a -story house with a light tower on one gable end. No sketches or photos exist to determine what was actually built. The location of the light was on a 30-foot sandy knoll near the shore close to the location of the present lighthouse, but the exact location is not known.

In 1858, the U.S. Lighthouse Establishment recognized the need for greater safety and replaced this house with a two-story brick residence with a 35-foot tower on top. The tower housed a Fourth Order Fresnel lens. A fog signal building was added and both structures still stand today.

The increased shipping traffic brought changes and in 1871, a 100-foot tower was built. The tower is 18 feet in diameter at the base. The walls are hollow and 5 feet thick at the base tapering to 3 feet thick at the top. A passageway was added connecting the tower to the keeper&#x27;s dwelling. A Third Order Fresnel lens from Paris was installed with a 3-wick lamp that had a range of 18 miles. In 1875, the first steam fog signal on Lake Michigan was installed replacing the fog bell. The 100 foot lighthouse was in operation from 1871 to 1958. The lighthouse is still in good condition. Recent efforts have restored its light tower to operational status for the summer months.

In 1901, the United States Life-Saving Service built a station on the island. The USLSS became part of the United States Coast Guard in 1915. The station was permanently closed in 1958. This station is now the island&#x27;s ranger station and is not open to the public.

==Shipwrecks==
The Manitou islands are surrounded by over 50 known shipwreck sites, some of which are popular diving spots. A preserve was established in 1988 to conserve the historic and archeological value of the fifty known shipwreck sites, dating from 1835 to 1960. One such shipwreck is the , which grounded and became a total loss in 1960 off the south shore of the island. She ran over the wreck of the bulk freighter , stranded November 4, 1903, with a cargo of corn and general merchandise.

The eastern side of the island is dominated by a large round bay. This bay is deep until very close to shore. On more than one occasion, ships found here a safe port in a storm, even some of the large bulk carriers. During the &quot;Big Blow&quot; of 1913, Captain John Stufflebeam nosed the bow of the passenger/packet steamer &quot;Illinois&quot; up onto the beach. He kept the engines going full for 49 hours so the wind would not blow the vessel back out to sea, until he was able to send two seamen ashore to fasten to a stout tree. When the storm abated 24 hours later, he untied from the tree, put his engines in reverse and backed away from shore to proceed safely on his journey.

<text>The German Aerospace Center (, abbreviated DLR, literally &quot;German Center for Air- and Space-flight&quot;) is the national center for aerospace, energy and transportation research of Germany, founded in 1969. It is headquartered in Cologne with 35 locations throughout Germany. The DLR is engaged in a wide range of research and development projects in national and international partnerships.

The DLR acts as the German space agency and is responsible for planning and implementing the German space programme on behalf of the German federal government. As a project management agency, DLR coordinates and answers the technical and organisational implementation of projects funded by a number of German federal ministries. As of 2020, the German Aerospace Center had a national budget of €1.348 billion.

== Overview ==
DLR has approximately 10.000 employees at 30 locations in Germany. Institutes and facilities are spread over 13 sites, as well as offices in Brussels, Paris and Washington, D.C. DLR has a budget of €1 billion to cover its own research, development and operations. Approximately 49% of this sum comes from competitively allocated third-party funds (German: &quot;Drittmittel&quot;). In addition to this, DLR administers around €860 million in German funds for the European Space Agency (ESA). In its capacity as project management agency, it manages €1.279 billion in research on behalf of German federal ministries. DLR is a full member of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems and a member of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres.

In the context of DLR&#x27;s initiatives to promote young research talent, 16 DLR School Labs were set up at University of Augsburg, Brandenburg University of Technology, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Technische Universität Hamburg-Harburg, RWTH Aachen, Technical University of Dortmund, Technische Universität Dresden and in Berlin-Adlershof, Braunschweig, Bremen, Cologne-Porz, Göttingen, Jena, Lampoldshausen/Stuttgart, Neustrelitz, and Oberpfaffenhofen over the past years. In the DLR School Labs, pupils can become acquainted with the practical aspects of natural and engineering sciences by conducting interesting experiments.

The members of the DLR executive board are Anke Kaysser-Pyzalla (chairman) since August 2015, Klaus Hamacher (vice chairman) since April 2006, Karsten Lemmer (member for Energy and Transport) since March 2017 and Walter Pelzer since 2021.

== History ==
The modern DLR was created in 1997, but was the culmination of over half a dozen space, aerospace, and research institutes from across the 20th century.

The oldest predecessor organization of DLR was established by Ludwig Prandtl in Göttingen in 1907. This (MLStG; German for &quot;Institute for Testing of Aerodynamic Models of the Powered Airship Society&quot;) later became the (&quot;Aerodynamics Laboratory&quot; or &quot;Aerodynamic Experimental Station&quot;).

In the 1920s Max Valier, a student of rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth, co-founded the , VfR, or &quot;Association of Space-Flight&quot;, with Johannes Winkler and Willy Ley. In parallel he was acting in collaboration with Fritz von Opel as one of the heads of Opel RAK, a private venture leading to the first manned rocket cars and rocket planes which paved the way for the Nazi era V2 program and US and Soviet activities from 1950 onwards. The Opel RAK program and the spectacular public demonstrations of ground and air vehicles drew large crowds, as well as caused global public excitement, and had a large impact on later spaceflight pioneers.

The Great Depression put an end to the program and briefly after its break-up, Valier eventually was killed while experimenting as part of VfR activities in collaboration with Heylandt-Werke on liquid-fueled rockets in April 1930. He is considered the first fatality of the early space age. Valier&#x27;s protégé Arthur Rudolph went on to develop an improved and safer version of Valier&#x27;s engine. Valier and von Opel had engaged in a program that led directly to use of jet-assisted takeoff for heavily laden aircraft. Their experiments had also a tremendous influence on Alexander Lippisch, whose experience with the rocket-powered (&quot;Duck&quot;) eventually paved the way to the Messerschmitt Me-163, the first operational rocket fighter craft.

The private experiments of the late 1920s and early 1930s excited also the interest of the German military, which provided funding for further development of rockets as a replacement for artillery. This led to an array of military applications, among them Germany&#x27;s V-2 terror weapon, the world&#x27;s first ballistic missile, and also the first human-made object to surpass the Kármán line and thus leaving the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

In the 1940s, the DVL (an AVA sister organization) funded Konrad Zuse&#x27;s work on the Z3 and Z4 computers. Another German aviation technology research facility, the 1935-founded, top-secret at Völkenrode which conducted research – much of it for military aviation to suit the Luftwaffe&#x27;s needs – in parallel to the then-existing forerunners of the DLR of today, would not be discovered by the Allies until after the war&#x27;s end.

In 1947, the (&quot;Consortium on Space Flight&quot;) was formed, leading to the (GfW; &quot;Society for Space Research&quot;) being formed in 1948.

In 1954, the Research Institute of Jet Propulsion Physics (FPS) was established at the Stuttgart airport.

What was later called the DLR was formed in 1969 as the (DFVLR; &quot;German Test and Research Institute for Aviation and Space Flight&quot;) through the merger of several institutions. These were the (AVA), the (DVL; &quot;German Laboratory for Aviation&quot;), the (DFL; &quot;German Research Institute for Aviation&quot;) and (in 1972) the (GfW; &quot;Society for Space Research&quot;).

In 1989, the DFVLR was renamed (DLR; &quot;German Research Institute for Aviation and Space Flight&quot;). Also in 1989, the (DARA; &quot;German Agency for Space Flight Affairs&quot;) was created.

Following the merger with the (DARA; German for &quot;German Agency for Space Flight Affairs&quot;) on 1 October 1997, the name was changed to (DLR), literally &quot;German Center for Aviation and Space Flight&quot;. The shorter translation &quot;German Aerospace Center&quot; is used in English-language publications.

Other German space organizations include the (IRS; Institute for Space Systems), founded in 1970. This should not be confused with DLR&#x27;s located in Bremen. Also, significant contributions are made to the European Space Agency.

== Research ==

DLR&#x27;s mission comprises the exploration of the Earth and the solar system, as well as research aimed at protecting the environment and developing environmentally compatible technologies, and at promoting mobility, communication and security. DLR&#x27;s research portfolio, which covers the four focus areas Aeronautics, Space, Transportation and Energy, ranges from basic research to innovative applications. DLR operates large-scale research centres, both for the benefit of its own projects and as a service for its clients and partners from the worlds of business and science.

The objective of DLR&#x27;s aeronautics research is to strengthen the competitive advantage of the national and European aeronautical industry and aviation sector, and to meet political and social demands – for instance with regard to climate-friendly aviation. German space research activities range from experiments under conditions of weightlessness to the exploration of other planets and environmental monitoring from space. In addition to these activities, DLR performs tasks of public authority pertaining to the planning and implementation of the German space programme, in its capacity as the official space agency of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The DLR&#x27;s Project Management Agency (German: &quot;Projektträger im DLR&quot;) has also been entrusted with tasks of public authority pertaining to the administration of subsidies. In the field of energy research, DLR is working on highly efficient, low- power generation technologies based on gas turbines and fuel cells, on solar thermal power generation, and on the efficient use of heat, including cogeneration based on fossil and renewable energy sources. The topics covered by DLR&#x27;s transportation research are maintaining mobility, protecting the environment and saving resources, and improving transportation safety.

In addition to the already existing projects Mars Express, global navigation satellite system Galileo, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, the Institute of Space Systems (German: &quot;Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme&quot;) was founded in Bremen in January 2007. In the future, 80 scientists and engineers will be doing research into topics such as space mission concepts, satellite development and propulsion technology.

=== Planetary research ===

==== Mars Express ====

The High Resolution Stereo Camera HRSC is the most important German contribution to the European Space Agency&#x27;s Mars Express mission. It is the first digital stereo camera that also generates multispectral data and that has a very high resolution lens. The camera records images of the Martian surface which formed the basis for a large number of scientific studies. With the HRSC, which was developed at the German Aerospace Center&#x27;s Institute of Planetary Research (German: &quot;Institut für Planetenforschung&quot;), it is possible to analyse details no larger than 10 to 30 meters in three dimensions.

==== Rosetta and Philae ====

The comet orbiter &quot;Rosetta&quot; is controlled from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany. The DLR has provided the structure, thermal subsystem, flywheel, the Active Descent System (procured by DLR but made in Switzerland), ROLIS, downward-looking camera, SESAME, acoustic sounding and seismic instrument for &quot;Philae&quot;, the orbiter&#x27;s landing unit. It has also managed the project and did the level product assurance. The University of Münster built MUPUS (it was designed and built in Space Research Centre of Polish Academy of Sciences) and the Braunschweig University of Technology the ROMAP instrument. The Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research made the payload engineering, eject mechanism, landing gear, anchoring harpoon, central computer, COSAC, APXS and other subsystems.

==== Dawn ====
The framing cameras, provided by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and the DLR, are the main imaging instruments of Dawn, a multi-destination space probe to the protoplanets 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres launched in 2007. The cameras offer resolutions of 17 m/pixel for Vesta and 66 m/pixel for Ceres. Because the framing cameras are vital for both science and navigation, the payload has two identical and physically separate cameras (FC1 &amp; FC2) for redundancy, each with its own optics, electronics, and structure.

=== Human spaceflight ===

==== Columbus ====
DLR operates the Columbus Control Centre in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. It is responsible for the coordination of scientific activities as well as for systems operations and life support on board the orbiting Columbus laboratory.

In February 2008, the Columbus laboratory, Europe&#x27;s core contribution to the International Space Station ISS, was brought into space by the Space Shuttle and docked to the ISS. The cylindrical module, which has a diameter of , contains state-of-the-art scientific equipment. It is planned to enable researchers on Earth to conduct thousands of experiments in biology, materials science, fluid physics and many other fields under conditions of weightlessness in space.

==== Spacelab, Shuttle, Mir, Soyuz ====
Germany has near ten astronauts and participates in ESA human space programs including flights of German astronauts aboard US Space Shuttles and Russian spacecraft. Besides missions under ESA and flights on Soyuz and Mir, two Space Shuttle missions with the European built Spacelab were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by Germany (like a separate few by ESA and one by Japan) with German astronauts on board as hosts and not guests. The first West German mission &quot;Deutschland 1&quot; (Spacelab-D1, DLR-1, NASA designation STS-61-A) took place in 1985.

The second similar mission, &quot;Deutschland 2&quot; (Spacelab-D2, DLR-2, NASA designation STS-55), was first planned for 1988, but then due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster was delayed until 1993 when it became the first German human space mission after German reunification.

=== Earth-bound research and aeronautics ===

==== Remote sensing of the Earth ====
In remote sensing of the Earth, satellites provide comprehensive and continually updated information on &quot;System Earth&quot;. This remote sensing data is used to investigate the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, land and ocean surfaces, and ice sheets. Practical applications of this technology include environmental monitoring and disaster relief.

Following the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004, for instance, up-to-date maps could be compiled very quickly using Earth observation satellites. These maps could then be used for orientation during relief missions. DLR conducts these research activities at the German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD) (German: &quot;Deutsches Fernerkundungsdatenzentrum&quot;), a DLR institute based in Oberpfaffenhofen. Nowadays, satellite data is also important for climate research: it is used to measure temperatures, levels, particulate matter levels, rainforest deforestation and the radiation conditions of the Earth&#x27;s surface (land, oceans, polar ice).

==== TerraSAR-X ====
The new German Earth observation satellite TerraSAR-X was launched in June 2007. The objective of this five-year mission is to provide radar remote sensing data to scientific and commercial users. The satellite&#x27;s design is based on the technology and expertise developed in the X-SAR and SRTM SAR missions (Synthetic Aperture Radar). The sensor has a number of different modes of operation, with a maximum resolution of one meter, and is capable of generating elevation profiles.

TerraSAR-X is the first satellite that was jointly paid for by government and industry. DLR contributed about 80 percent of the total expenses, with the remainder being covered by EADS Astrium. The satellite&#x27;s core component is a radar sensor operating in the X band and capable of recording the Earth&#x27;s surface using a range of different modes of operation, capturing an area of 10 to 100 kilometers in size with a resolution of 1 to 16 meters.

====Astronomical surveys====
The Uppsala–DLR Trojan Survey (UDTS) was a search for asteroids near Jupiter in the 1990s, in collaboration with the Swedish Uppsala Astronomical Observatory. When it concluded there was another survey, the Uppsala–DLR Asteroid Survey, this time with a focus on Near Earth asteroids and both surveys discovered numerous objects.

==== Reusable launch systems ====
===== Suborbital Spaceplane =====
Studying a suborbital spaceplane, DLR conducted Falke prototype for Hermes spaceplane program, participates in non-realized Sanger II project and since 2005 work under the concept making fast intercontinental passenger transport possible. The SpaceLiner is a reusable vehicle lifting-off vertically and landing like a glider.

===== RETALT =====
DLR is a partner for RETALT (RETro Propulsion Assisted Landing Technologies), a program aiming to develop two-stage-to-orbit and single-stage to orbit reusable launch systems.

==== Aircraft design ====
DLR is involved in different European H2020 projects (AGILE, AGILE4.0) concerning aircraft design with the objective to improve multidisciplinary optimization using distributed analysis frameworks.

==== Research aircraft ====

DLR operates Europe&#x27;s largest fleet of research aircraft. The aircraft are used both as research objects and as research tools. DLR&#x27;s research aircraft provide platforms for all kinds of research missions. Scientists and engineers can use them for practical, application-oriented purposes: Earth observation, atmospheric research or testing new aircraft components. DLR is for instance investigating wing flutter and possible ways of eliminating it, which would also help to reduce aircraft noise. So-called &quot;flying simulators&quot; can be used to simulate the flight performance of aircraft that have not been built yet. This method was for instance used to test the Airbus A380 in the early stages of its development. The VFW 614 ATTAS was used to test several systems.

The high-altitude research aircraft HALO (High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft) will be used for atmospheric research and Earth observation from 2009. With a cruising altitude of more than 15 kilometers and a range of over 8,000 kilometers, HALO will provide for the first time the capability to gather data on a continental scale, at all latitudes, from the tropics to the poles, and at altitudes as high as the lower stratosphere.

The Airbus A320-232 &quot;D-ATRA&quot;, the latest and largest addition to the fleet, has been in use by the German Aerospace Center since late 2008. ATRA (Advanced Technology Research Aircraft) is a modern and flexible flight test platform which sets a new benchmark for flying test beds in European aerospace research – and not just because of its size.

DLR and NASA jointly operate the flying infrared telescope SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy). A Boeing 747SP with a modified fuselage enabling it to carry a reflecting telescope developed in Germany is used as an airborne research platform. The aircraft is operated by the Dryden Flight Research Center at Site 9 (USAF Plant 42) in Palmdale, California. Observation flights will be flown 3 or 4 nights a week, for up to eight hours at a time and at an altitude of 12 to 14 kilometers. SOFIA has been designed to remain operational for a period of 20 years. It is the successor to the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO), which was deployed from 1974 to 1995.

On 31 January 2020, the DLR put its newest aircraft into service, a Falcon 2000LX ISTAR (In-flight Systems &amp; Technology Airborne Research).

==== Emissions research ====
DLR conducts research into and noise emissions caused by air transport. In order to ensure that increasing traffic volumes do not lead to an increase in the noise pollution caused by air transport, DLR is investigating options for noise reduction. The &quot;Low-noise Approach and Departure Procedures&quot; research project (German: &quot;Lärmoptimierte An- und Abflugverfahren&quot;), for instance, forms part of the national research project &quot;Quiet Traffic&quot; (German: &quot;Leiser Verkehr&quot;).

The objective of this project is to find flight procedures that can reduce the amount of noise generated during takeoff and landing. One approach is to analyse noise propagation at ground level during takeoff using a large number of microphones. Researchers are also trying to reduce the noise at source, focusing for instance on airframe and engine noise. They hope to minimise noise generated in the engines using so-called &quot;antinoise&quot;.

The German Aerospace Center&#x27;s research work on emissions caused by air transport focuses for instance on model calculations concerning the effects of converting the global aircraft fleet to hydrogen propulsion. The growth rates of aviation are above average. This raises the question if emission-free hydrogen propulsion could perhaps limit the effects of growing air traffic volumes on the environment and the climate.

==== Hydrogen as an energy carrier ====
The Hydrosol and Hydrosol-2 is one of the energy research projects in which DLR scientists are engaged. For the first time, scientists have achieved thermal water splitting using solar energy, generating hydrogen and oxygen without emissions. For this achievement, the DLR team and several other research groups received the Descartes Prize, a research award created by the European Commission. The FP6 Hydrosol II pilot reactor (around 100 kW) for solar thermochemical hydrogen production at the Plataforma Solar de Almería in Spain started in November 2005 and is in operation since 2008.

==== Traffic Congestion====

During the 2006 FIFA World Cup football championship, DLR implemented the Soccer project aimed at preventing traffic congestion. In this transportation research project, traffic data was obtained from the air in Berlin, Stuttgart and Cologne and used as input for traffic forecasting. A sensor system combining a conventional and a thermographic camera was used to obtain the data. A zeppelin, an aeroplane and a helicopter served as flying research platforms. An image analysis software package generated aerial photos showing the current traffic parameters as well as traffic forecasts. In this way, traffic control centres could be provided with almost-real-time traffic information, and road users could be diverted whenever necessary.

==== Solar tower power plant ====

In 2007, the first commercially operated solar tower power plant, the PS10 solar power tower, was commissioned. It has a capacity of eleven megawatt and it is located near Sevilla, in Sanlúcar la Mayor (Spain). DLR is prominently involved in developing the technology for this type of power plant. In solar tower power plants, sun-tracking mirrors (heliostats) redirect the solar radiation onto a central heat exchanger (receiver) on top of a tower. This generates high-temperature process heat, which can then be used in gas or steam turbine power plants to generate electrical power for the public electricity grid. In the future, solar thermal tower plant technology could also be used to generate solar fuels, such as hydrogen, without emissions.

<doc id="647630" wikidata="Q211884" url="?curid=647630" title="Byzantine art">
<text>Byzantine art comprises the body of artistic products of the Eastern Roman Empire, as well as the nations and states that inherited culturally from the empire. Though the empire itself emerged from the decline of western Rome and lasted until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the start date of the Byzantine period is rather clearer in art history than in political history, if still imprecise. Many Eastern Orthodox states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the Islamic states of the eastern Mediterranean, preserved many aspects of the empire&#x27;s culture and art for centuries afterward.

A number of contemporary states with the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire were culturally influenced by it without actually being part of it (the &quot;Byzantine commonwealth&quot;). These included Kievan Rus&#x27;, as well as some non-Orthodox states like the Republic of Venice, which separated from the Byzantine Empire in the 10th century, and the Kingdom of Sicily, which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire and had also been a Byzantine territory until the 10th century with a large Greek-speaking population persisting into the 12th century. Other states having a Byzantine artistic tradition, had oscillated throughout the Middle Ages between being part of the Byzantine Empire and having periods of independence, such as Serbia and Bulgaria. After the fall of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 1453, art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the Ottoman Empire was often called &quot;post-Byzantine.&quot; Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in Greece, Cyprus, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.

==Introduction==
Byzantine art originated and evolved from the Christianized Greek culture of the Eastern Roman Empire; content from both Christianity and classical Greek mythology were artistically expressed through Hellenistic modes of style and iconography. The art of Byzantium never lost sight of its classical heritage; the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, was adorned with a large number of classical sculptures, although they eventually became an object of some puzzlement for its inhabitants (however, Byzantine beholders showed no signs of puzzlement towards other forms of classical media such as wall paintings). The basis of Byzantine art is a fundamental artistic attitude held by the Byzantine Greeks who, like their ancient Greek predecessors, &quot;were never satisfied with a play of forms alone, but stimulated by an innate rationalism, endowed forms with life by associating them with a meaningful content.&quot; Although the art produced in the Byzantine Empire was marked by periodic revivals of a classical aesthetic, it was above all marked by the development of a new aesthetic defined by its salient &quot;abstract&quot;, or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach.

The nature and causes of this transformation, which largely took place during late antiquity, have been a subject of scholarly debate for centuries. Giorgio Vasari attributed it to a decline in artistic skills and standards, which had in turn been revived by his contemporaries in the Italian Renaissance. Although this point of view has been occasionally revived, most notably by Bernard Berenson, modern scholars tend to take a more positive view of the Byzantine aesthetic. Alois Riegl and Josef Strzygowski, writing in the early 20th century, were above all responsible for the revaluation of late antique art. Riegl saw it as a natural development of pre-existing tendencies in Roman art, whereas Strzygowski viewed it as a product of &quot;oriental&quot; influences. Notable recent contributions to the debate include those of Ernst Kitzinger, who traced a &quot;dialectic&quot; between &quot;abstract&quot; and &quot;Hellenistic&quot; tendencies in late antiquity, and John Onians, who saw an &quot;increase in visual response&quot; in late antiquity, through which a viewer &quot;could look at something which was in twentieth-century terms purely abstract and find it representational.&quot;

In any case, the debate is purely modern: it is clear that most Byzantine viewers did not consider their art to be abstract or unnaturalistic. As Cyril Mango has observed, &quot;our own appreciation of Byzantine art stems largely from the fact that this art is not naturalistic; yet the Byzantines themselves, judging by their extant statements, regarded it as being highly naturalistic and as being directly in the tradition of Phidias, Apelles, and Zeuxis.&quot;

The subject matter of monumental Byzantine art was primarily religious and imperial: the two themes are often combined, as in the portraits of later Byzantine emperors that decorated the interior of the sixth-century church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. These preoccupations are partly a result of the pious and autocratic nature of Byzantine society, and partly a result of its economic structure: the wealth of the empire was concentrated in the hands of the church and the imperial office, which had the greatest opportunity to undertake monumental artistic commissions.

Religious art was not, however, limited to the monumental decoration of church interiors. One of the most important genres of Byzantine art was the icon, an image of Christ, the Virgin, or a saint, used as an object of veneration in Orthodox churches and private homes alike. Icons were more religious than aesthetic in nature: especially after the end of iconoclasm, they were understood to manifest the unique &quot;presence&quot; of the figure depicted by means of a &quot;likeness&quot; to that figure maintained through carefully maintained canons of representation.

Byzantine illuminated manuscripts were another major genre of Byzantine art. The most commonly illustrated texts were religious, both scripture itself (particularly the Psalms) and devotional or theological texts (such as the &quot;Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot; of John Climacus or the homilies of Gregory of Nazianzus). Secular texts were also illuminated: important examples include the Alexander Romance and the history of John Skylitzes.

The Byzantines inherited the Early Christian distrust of monumental sculpture in religious art, and produced only reliefs, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in sharp contrast to the medieval art of the West, where monumental sculpture revived from Carolingian art onwards. Small ivories were also mostly in relief.

The so-called &quot;minor arts&quot; were very important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation Consular diptychs or caskets such as the Veroli casket, hardstone carvings, enamels, glass, jewelry, metalwork, and figured silks were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era, many continuing and adapting late Roman artistic practice though Byzantine silk production only began after they imported silkworms from China in the late sixth century. Many of these were religious in nature, although a large number of objects with secular or non-representational decoration were produced: for example, ivories representing themes from classical mythology. Byzantine ceramics were relatively crude, as pottery was never used at the tables of the rich, who ate off Byzantine silver.

==Periods==
Byzantine art and architecture is divided into four periods by convention: the Early period, commencing with the Edict of Milan (when Christian worship was legitimized) and the transfer of the imperial seat to Constantinople, extends to AD 842, with the conclusion of Iconoclasm; the Middle, or high period, begins with the restoration of the icons in 843 and culminates in the Fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204; the Late period includes the eclectic osmosis between Western European and traditional Byzantine elements in art and architecture, and ends with the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The term post-Byzantine is then used for later years, whereas &quot;Neo-Byzantine&quot; is used for art and architecture from the 19th century onwards, when the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire prompted a renewed appreciation of Byzantium by artists and historians alike.

=== Early Byzantine art ===
Two events were of fundamental importance to the development of a unique, Byzantine art. First, the Edict of Milan, issued by the emperors Constantine I and Licinius in 313, allowed for public Christian worship, and led to the development of a monumental, Christian art. Second, the dedication of Constantinople in 330 created a great new artistic centre for the eastern half of the Empire, and a specifically Christian one. Other artistic traditions flourished in rival cities such as Alexandria, Antioch, and Rome, but it was not until all of these cities had fallen - the first two to the Arabs and Rome to the Goths - that Constantinople established its supremacy.

Constantine devoted great effort to the decoration of Constantinople, adorning its public spaces with ancient statuary, and building a forum dominated by a porphyry column that carried a statue of himself. Major Constantinopolitan churches built under Constantine and his son, Constantius II, included the original foundations of Hagia Sophia and the Church of the Holy Apostles.

The next major building campaign in Constantinople was sponsored by Theodosius I. The most important surviving monument of this period is the obelisk and base erected by Theodosius in the Hippodrome which, with the large silver dish called the Missorium of Theodosius I, represents the classic examples of what is sometimes called the &quot;Theodosian Renaissance&quot;. The earliest surviving church in Constantinople is the Basilica of St. John at the Stoudios Monastery, built in the fifth century.

Due to subsequent rebuilding and destruction, relatively few Constantinopolitan monuments of this early period survive. However, the development of monumental early Byzantine art can still be traced through surviving structures in other cities. For example, important early churches are found in Rome (including Santa Sabina and Santa Maria Maggiore), and in Thessaloniki (the Rotunda and the Acheiropoietos Basilica).

A number of important illuminated manuscripts, both sacred and secular, survive from this early period. Classical authors, including Virgil (represented by the Vergilius Vaticanus and the Vergilius Romanus) and Homer (represented by the Ambrosian Iliad), were illustrated with narrative paintings. Illuminated biblical manuscripts of this period survive only in fragments: for example, the Quedlinburg Itala fragment is a small portion of what must have been a lavishly illustrated copy of 1 Kings.

Early Byzantine art was also marked by the cultivation of ivory carving. Ivory diptychs, often elaborately decorated, were issued as gifts by newly appointed consuls. Silver plates were another important form of luxury art: among the most lavish from this period is the Missorium of Theodosius I. Sarcophagi continued to be produced in great numbers.

===Age of Justinian===

Significant changes in Byzantine art coincided with the reign of Justinian I (527–565). Justinian devoted much of his reign to reconquering Italy, North Africa and Spain. He also laid the foundations of the imperial absolutism of the Byzantine state, codifying its laws and imposing his religious views on all his subjects by law.

A significant component of Justinian&#x27;s project of imperial renovation was a massive building program, which was described in a book, the &quot;Buildings&quot;, written by Justinian&#x27;s court historian, Procopius. Justinian renovated, rebuilt, or founded anew countless churches within Constantinople, including Hagia Sophia, which had been destroyed during the Nika riots, the Church of the Holy Apostles, and the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus. Justinian also built a number of churches and fortifications outside of the imperial capital, including Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt, Basilica of Saint Sofia in Sofia and the Basilica of St. John in Ephesus.

Several major churches of this period were built in the provinces by local bishops in imitation of the new Constantinopolitan foundations. The Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, was built by Bishop Maximianus. The decoration of San Vitale includes important mosaics of Justinian and his empress, Theodora, although neither ever visited the church. Also of note is the Euphrasian Basilica in Poreč.

Recent archeological discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries unearthed a large group of Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East. The eastern provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire inherited a strong artistic tradition from Late Antiquity. Christian mosaic art flourished in this area from the 4th century onwards. The tradition of making mosaics was carried on in the Umayyad era until the end of the 8th century. The most important surviving examples are the Madaba Map, the mosaics of Mount Nebo, Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery and the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now Umm ar-Rasas).

The first fully preserved illuminated biblical manuscripts date to the first half of the sixth century, most notably the Vienna Genesis, the Rossano Gospels, and the Sinope Gospels. The Vienna Dioscurides is a lavishly illustrated botanical treatise, presented as a gift to the Byzantine aristocrat Julia Anicia.

Important ivory sculptures of this period include the Barberini ivory, which probably depicts Justinian himself, and the Archangel ivory in the British Museum. Byzantine silver plate continued to be decorated with scenes drawn from classical mythology; for example, a plate in the Cabinet des Médailles, Paris, depicts Hercules wrestling the Nemean lion.

===Seventh-century crisis===

The Age of Justinian was followed by a political decline, since most of Justinian&#x27;s conquests were lost and the Empire faced acute crisis with the invasions of the Avars, Slavs, Persians and Arabs in the 7th century. Constantinople was also wracked by religious and political conflict.

The most significant surviving monumental projects of this period were undertaken outside of the imperial capital. The church of Hagios Demetrios in Thessaloniki was rebuilt after a fire in the mid-seventh century. The new sections include mosaics executed in a remarkably abstract style. The church of the Koimesis in Nicaea (present-day Iznik), destroyed in the early 20th century but documented through photographs, demonstrates the simultaneous survival of a more classical style of church decoration. The churches of Rome, still a Byzantine territory in this period, also include important surviving decorative programs, especially Santa Maria Antiqua, Sant&#x27;Agnese fuori le mura, and the Chapel of San Venanzio in San Giovanni in Laterano. Byzantine mosaicists probably also contributed to the decoration of the early Umayyad monuments, including the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the Great Mosque of Damascus.

Important works of luxury art from this period include the silver David Plates, produced during the reign of Emperor Heraclius, and depicting scenes from the life of the Hebrew king David. The most notable surviving manuscripts are Syriac gospel books, such as the so-called Syriac Bible of Paris. However, the London Canon Tables bear witness to the continuing production of lavish gospel books in Greek.

The period between Justinian and iconoclasm saw major changes in the social and religious roles of images within Byzantium. The veneration of acheiropoieta, or holy images &quot;not made by human hands,&quot; became a significant phenomenon, and in some instances these images were credited with saving cities from military assault. By the end of the seventh century, certain images of saints had come to be viewed as &quot;windows&quot; through which one could communicate with the figure depicted. Proskynesis before images is also attested in texts from the late seventh century. These developments mark the beginnings of a theology of icons.

At the same time, the debate over the proper role of art in the decoration of churches intensified. Three canons of the Quinisext Council of 692 addressed controversies in this area: prohibition of the representation of the cross on church pavements (Canon 73), prohibition of the representation of Christ as a lamb (Canon 82), and a general injunction against &quot;pictures, whether they are in paintings or in what way so ever, which attract the eye and corrupt the mind, and incite it to the enkindling of base pleasures&quot; (Canon 100).

===Crisis of iconoclasm===

Intense debate over the role of art in worship led eventually to the period of &quot;Byzantine iconoclasm.&quot; Sporadic outbreaks of iconoclasm on the part of local bishops are attested in Asia Minor during the 720s. In 726, an underwater earthquake between the islands of Thera and Therasia was interpreted by Emperor Leo III as a sign of God&#x27;s anger, and may have led Leo to remove a famous icon of Christ from the Chalke Gate outside the imperial palace. However, iconoclasm probably did not become imperial policy until the reign of Leo&#x27;s son, Constantine V. The Council of Hieria, convened under Constantine in 754, proscribed the manufacture of icons of Christ. This inaugurated the Iconoclastic period, which lasted, with interruptions, until 843.

While iconoclasm severely restricted the role of religious art, and led to the removal of some earlier apse mosaics and (possibly) the sporadic destruction of portable icons, it never constituted a total ban on the production of figural art. Ample literary sources indicate that secular art (i.e. hunting scenes and depictions of the games in the hippodrome) continued to be produced, and the few monuments that can be securely dated to the period (most notably the manuscript of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Handy Tables&quot; today held by the Vatican) demonstrate that metropolitan artists maintained a high quality of production.

Major churches dating to this period include Hagia Eirene in Constantinople, which was rebuilt in the 760s following its destruction by the 740 earthquake. The interior of Hagia Eirene, which is dominated by a large mosaic cross in the apse, is one of the best-preserved examples of iconoclastic church decoration. The church of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki was also rebuilt in the late 8th century.

Certain churches built outside of the empire during this period, but decorated in a figural, &quot;Byzantine,&quot; style, may also bear witness to the continuing activities of Byzantine artists. Particularly important in this regard are the original mosaics of the Palatine Chapel in Aachen (since either destroyed or heavily restored) and the frescoes in the Church of &quot;Maria foris portas&quot; in Castelseprio.

===Macedonian art===


The rulings of the Council of Hieria were reversed by a new church council in 843, celebrated to this day in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the &quot;Triumph of Orthodoxy.&quot; In 867, the installation of a new apse mosaic in Hagia Sophia depicting the Virgin and Child was celebrated by the Patriarch Photios in a famous homily as a victory over the evils of iconoclasm. Later in the same year, the Emperor Basil I, called &quot;the Macedonian,&quot; acceded to the throne; as a result the following period of Byzantine art has sometimes been called the &quot;Macedonian Renaissance&quot;, although the term is doubly problematic (it was neither &quot;Macedonian&quot;, nor, strictly speaking, a &quot;Renaissance&quot;).

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Empire&#x27;s military situation improved, and patronage of art and architecture increased. New churches were commissioned, and the standard architectural form (the &quot;cross-in-square&quot;) and decorative scheme of the Middle Byzantine church were standardised. Major surviving examples include Hosios Loukas in Boeotia, the Daphni Monastery near Athens and Nea Moni on Chios.

There was a revival of interest in the depiction of subjects from classical Greek mythology (as on the Veroli Casket) and in the use of a &quot;classical&quot; Hellenistic styles to depict religious, and particularly Old Testament, subjects (of which the Paris Psalter and the Joshua Roll are important examples).

The Macedonian period also saw a revival of the late antique technique of ivory carving. Many ornate ivory triptychs and diptychs survive, such as the Harbaville Triptych and a triptych at Luton Hoo, dating from the reign of Nicephorus Phocas.

===Komnenian age===
The Macedonian emperors were followed by the Komnenian dynasty, beginning with the reign of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081. Byzantium had recently suffered a period of severe dislocation following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 and the subsequent loss of Asia Minor to the Turks. However, the Komnenoi brought stability to the empire (1081–1185) and during the course of the twelfth century their energetic campaigning did much to restore the fortunes of the empire. The Komnenoi were great patrons of the arts, and with their support Byzantine artists continued to move in the direction of greater humanism and emotion, of which the Theotokos of Vladimir, the cycle of mosaics at Daphni, and the murals at Nerezi yield important examples. Ivory sculpture and other expensive mediums of art gradually gave way to frescoes and icons, which for the first time gained widespread popularity across the Empire. Apart from painted icons, there were other varieties - notably the mosaic and ceramic ones.

Some of the finest Byzantine work of this period may be found outside the Empire: in the mosaics of Gelati, Kiev, Torcello, Venice, Monreale, Cefalù and Palermo. For instance, Venice&#x27;s Basilica of St Mark, begun in 1063, was based on the great Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, now destroyed, and is thus an echo of the age of Justinian. The acquisitive habits of the Venetians mean that the basilica is also a great museum of Byzantine artworks of all kinds (e.g., Pala d&#x27;Oro).

===Ivory caskets of the Macedonian era (gallery)===
===Palaeologan age===

Centuries of continuous Roman political tradition and Hellenistic civilization underwent a crisis in 1204 with the sacking of Constantinople by the Venetian and French knights of the Fourth Crusade, a disaster from which the Empire recovered in 1261 albeit in a severely weakened state. The destruction by sack or subsequent neglect of the city&#x27;s secular architecture in particular has left us with an imperfect understanding of Byzantine art.

Although the Byzantines regained the city in 1261, the Empire was thereafter a small and weak state confined to the Greek peninsula and the islands of the Aegean. During their half-century of exile, however, the last great flowering of Anatolian Hellenism began. As Nicaea emerged as the center of opposition under the Laskaris emperors, it spawned a renaissance, attracting scholars, poets, and artists from across the Byzantine world. A glittering court emerged as the dispossessed intelligentsia found in the Hellenic side of their traditions a pride and identity unsullied by association with the hated &quot;latin&quot; enemy. With the recapture of the capital under the new Palaeologan Dynasty, Byzantine artists developed a new interest in landscapes and pastoral scenes, and the traditional mosaic-work (of which the Chora Church in Constantinople is the finest extant example) gradually gave way to detailed cycles of narrative frescoes (as evidenced in a large group of Mystras churches). The icons, which became a favoured medium for artistic expression, were characterized by a less austere attitude, new appreciation for purely decorative qualities of painting and meticulous attention to details, earning the popular name of the Paleologan Mannerism for the period in general.

Venice came to control Byzantine Crete by 1212, and Byzantine artistic traditions continued long after the Ottoman conquest of the last Byzantine successor state in 1461. The Cretan school, as it is today known, gradually introduced Italian Renaissance elements into its style, and exported large numbers of icons to Italy. The tradition&#x27;s most famous artist was El Greco.

==Legacy==


The Byzantine Empire emerged from the Eastern Roman Empire in the 4th century AD, and its unique culture heavily influenced Western Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Byzantine art was an essential part of this culture and had certain defining characteristics, such as intricate patterns, rich colors, and religious themes depicting important figures in Christianity.

The fall of Constantinople in 1453 was a significant event in the history of the Byzantine Empire, and it had a profound impact on the art world. Many Byzantine artists and intellectuals migrated to Italy, where they played a vital role in shaping the Italian Renaissance. The migration was partly due to the long-standing cultural and commercial ties between the Byzantine Empire and Italian city-states, such as Venice and Florence, as well as the decline of the Byzantine Empire in the preceding centuries.

The influence of Byzantine art on Italian art was significant, with Byzantine artists bringing their techniques and knowledge to Italy, such as the use of gold leaf and mosaics. They also played a significant role in developing perspective, which became a key element of Renaissance art.

The splendour of Byzantine art was always in the mind of early medieval Western artists and patrons, and many of the most important movements in the period were conscious attempts to produce art fit to stand next to both classical Roman and contemporary Byzantine art. This was especially the case for the imperial Carolingian art and Ottonian art. Luxury products from the Empire were highly valued, and reached for example the royal Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo burial in Suffolk of the 620s, which contains several pieces of silver. Byzantine silks were especially valued and large quantities were distributed as diplomatic gifts from Constantinople. There are records of Byzantine artists working in the West, especially during the period of iconoclasm, and some works, like the frescos at Castelseprio and miniatures in the Vienna Coronation Gospels, seem to have been produced by such figures.

In particular, teams of mosaic artists were dispatched as diplomatic gestures by emperors to Italy, where they often trained locals to continue their work in a style heavily influenced by Byzantium. Venice and Norman Sicily were particular centres of Byzantine influence. The earliest surviving panel paintings in the West were in a style heavily influenced by contemporary Byzantine icons, until a distinctive Western style began to develop in Italy in the Trecento; the traditional and still influential narrative of Vasari and others has the story of Western painting begin as a breakaway by Cimabue and then Giotto from the shackles of the Byzantine tradition. In general, Byzantine artistic influence on Europe was in steep decline by the 14th century if not earlier, despite the continued importance of migrated Byzantine scholars in the Renaissance in other areas.

Islamic art began with artists and craftsmen mostly trained in Byzantine styles, and though figurative content was greatly reduced, Byzantine decorative styles remained a great influence on Islamic art, and Byzantine artists continued to be imported for important works for some time, especially for mosaics.

The Byzantine era properly defined came to an end with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, but by this time the Byzantine cultural heritage had been widely diffused, carried by the spread of Orthodox Christianity, to Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania and, most importantly, to Russia, which became the centre of the Orthodox world following the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. Even under Ottoman rule, Byzantine traditions in icon-painting and other small-scale arts survived, especially in the Venetian-ruled Crete and Rhodes, where a &quot;post-Byzantine&quot; style under increasing Western influence survived for a further two centuries, producing artists including El Greco whose training was in the Cretan School which was the most vigorous post-Byzantine school, exporting great numbers of icons to Europe. The willingness of the Cretan School to accept Western influence was atypical; in most of the post-Byzantine world &quot;as an instrument of ethnic cohesiveness, art became assertively conservative during the &quot;Turcocratia&quot;&quot; (period of Ottoman rule).

Russian icon painting began by entirely adopting and imitating Byzantine art, as did the art of other Orthodox nations, and has remained extremely conservative in iconography, although its painting style has developed distinct characteristics, including influences from post-Renaissance Western art. All the Eastern Orthodox churches have remained highly protective of their traditions in terms of the form and content of images and, for example, modern Orthodox depictions of the Nativity of Christ vary little in content from those developed in the 6th century.

<text>The Adirondack High Peaks are a set of 46 mountain peaks in the Adirondack Mountains of New York state. They have been popular hiking destinations since the late 1920s, when the list of peaks was published in Russell Carson&#x27;s book &quot;Peaks and Peoples of the Adirondacks&quot;. Those who have climbed all 46 High Peaks are eligible to join the Adirondack Forty-Sixers club.

== Origin ==
The list of peaks was originally compiled by the mountaineers Herbert Clark, Bob Marshall, and George Marshall, with input from Russell Carson. The Marshall brothers wished to climb every notable peak in the Adirondacks, which they accomplished with Clark between 1918 and 1925. The criteria used were that all peaks should be at least in elevation and either have of prominence or of distance from another peak. Several exceptions to these rules were made to include or exclude peaks based on their preferences; Gray Peak, Wright Peak, Armstrong Mountain, Upper Wolfjaw Mountain, and South Dix were included but did not meet either the prominence or distance rule, while Little Marcy, Yard Mountain, and two then-unnamed peaks were excluded. Later surveys revealed that Blake Peak, Cliff Mountain, Couchsachraga Peak, and Nye Mountain are under 4,000 feet in elevation. A survey in the mid-20th century measured the elevation of MacNaughton Mountain as exactly , but a more recent survey listed the mountain at . No mountains have been removed or added to the list since the 1920s due to tradition.

== Location ==
All but three of the peaks are located in central and northern Essex County, primarily south of Lake Placid and Keene Valley. The others are just to the west in Franklin County. All of the summits are on land owned by New York State as part of its Forest Preserve. 42 are in a vast tract of nearly known as the High Peaks Wilderness Area, subdivided into central (26 peaks) and outer (16 peaks) zones. Nine of the peaks in the outer zone are in an area formerly known as the Dix Mountain Wilderness Area, which was added to the High Peaks Wilderness in 2018. Giant Mountain and Rocky Peak Ridge are in the adjacent Giant Mountain Wilderness Area. Whiteface Mountain and Esther Mountain are north of Lake Placid in the Wilmington Wild Forest.

=== Mountain ranges ===
There are many Mountain ranges within the High Peaks. The Dix Range includes five out of the forty-six High Peaks: Macomb, Grace Peak, South Dix, Hough, and Dix Mountain. The Great Range includes seven out of the forty-six High Peaks: Lower Wolfjaw, Upper Wolfjaw, Armstrong, Gothics, Saddleback, Basin, and Haystack. The Seward Range includes four out of the forty-six High Peaks: Seward, Donaldson, Emmons, and Seymour Mountain. The MacIntyre Range includes four out of the forty-six High Peaks: Mount Marshall, Wright, Algonquin and Iroquois. The Santanoni Range includes three out of the forty-six High Peaks: Santanoni, Panther, and Couchsachraga.
== Ecosystems ==

The region contains many alpine lakes and meadows, wetlands, streams, and forests. Atop the highest peaks, above the tree line, lies a small alpine ecosystem, a remnant of a larger lowland tundra that retreated uphill following the most recent period of glaciation. The amount of this ecosystem is constantly changing due to variation in the climate from year to year, and has been estimated by different methods to only cover between . The alpine ecosystem is considered extremely fragile to damage from hikers, and the Adirondack Mountain Club launched an education campaign to avoid further damage in the 1970s, since which some peaks have seen documented recovery.

The Eastern High Peaks Wilderness area is the most regulated area. Fires are not permitted; dogs must be leashed; overnight groups are limited to eight people and day groups to 15; and bear-resistant food canisters are required from April through November. Camping is prohibited above any elevation greater than 4,000 feet on any of the Adirondack High Peaks.

== Reaching the summits ==
Of the two highest peaks, Algonquin Peak is regarded as a more challenging hike than Mount Marcy. Twenty of the peaks have no official trail to the top, although rough informal routes, commonly referred to as &quot;herd paths,&quot; have developed over the years. No true bushwhacking is required on any of the peaks, although some trails are still quite primitive.

The summit of Whiteface Mountain can alternatively be reached by motor vehicle on the Whiteface Mountain Veterans&#x27; Memorial Highway.

<text>Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei (May or June 483 – February 12, 515) was an emperor of the Xianbei-led Chinese Northern Wei dynasty (499-515). He was born Tuoba Ke, but later changed his surname so that he became Yuan Ke. During Emperor Xuanwu&#x27;s reign, Northern Wei appeared, outwardly, to be at its prime, but there was much political infighting and corruption, particularly by Emperor Xuanwu&#x27;s uncle Gao Zhao.

Emperor Xuanwu was an avid Buddhist and often personally lectured on the Buddhist sutras. During his reign, Buddhism effectively became the state religion.

== Background ==

Tuoba Ke was born in 483, as the second son of Emperor Xiaowen. His mother was Xiaowen&#x27;s concubine Consort, Gao Zhaorong. (As he was born in the same year as his older brother Tuoba Xun, he was probably born just briefly after Tuoba Xun, whose mother was Consort Lin.) Little is known about his childhood, including whether he was raised by his mother Lady Gao or not. In 496, Xiaowen changed the name of the imperial clan from Tuoba to Yuan, and thereafter he would be known as Yuan Ke.

In fall 496, Yuan Xun, who was then crown prince, but who could not endure the hot weather of the capital Luoyang after Xiaowen moved the capital there from Pingcheng (平城, in modern Datong, Shanxi) in 494, plotted to flee back to Pingcheng with his followers, but his plot was discovered. Xiaowen deposed him, and on 23 February 497 created Yuan Ke crown prince to replace Yuan Xun. (The creation was in Luoyang, but it is unclear whether prior to his creation, Yuan Xun was at Luoyang or Pingcheng.) Later that year, Gao, who was in Pingcheng, travelled south to rejoin her son in Luoyang, but she died on the way. Historians generally believe that she was murdered by Xiaowen&#x27;s wife, Empress Feng Run, who wanted to raise Yuan Ke herself. Whether she was actually able to do so is unclear, but after she was discovered to have carried on an affair with her attendant Gao Pusa (高菩薩) in 499, she was put under house arrest, and Xiaowen ordered Yuan Ke to have no more contact with her.

Later in 499, Xiaowen, while on a campaign against rival Southern Qi, grew ill and died. Xiaowen&#x27;s brother Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng was put into command of the withdrawing army on an emergency basis, and Yuan Xie kept Xiaowen&#x27;s death a secret while summoning Yuan Ke to join the army. Yuan Ke&#x27;s attendants largely suspected Yuan Xie of wanting to take the throne himself, but Yuan Xie, once he met Yuan Ke, showed great deference to Yuan Ke, convincing Yuan Ke of his loyalty. Yuan Ke, at age 16, then took the throne as Xuanwu at Luyang (魯陽, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan), before the army could return to Luoyang.

== Early reign ==

Xuanwu initially wanted to make Yuan Xie, who was popular and well-regarded, prime minister, but Yuan Xie refused, and was made a provincial governor instead. The governmental affairs were largely in the hands of six officials: Xiaowen&#x27;s brothers Yuan Xi (元禧) the Prince of Xianyang and Yuan Xiang (元詳) the Prince of Beihai, Xiaowen&#x27;s cousin Yuan Cheng (元澄) the Prince of Rencheng, Xiaowen&#x27;s distant uncle Yuan Jia (元嘉) the Prince of Guangyang, and the officials Wang Su (王肅) and Song Bian (宋弁), although Yuan Cheng was soon stripped of his post because he falsely arrested Wang on suspicion of treason. By 500, Xuanwu recalled Yuan Xie to be prime minister.

Xuanwu, once he returned to Luoyang, posthumously honored his mother Gao as an empress, and he created his maternal uncles Gao Zhao and Gao Xian (高顯), as well as his cousin Gao Meng (高猛), none of whom he had previously met, dukes. Gao Zhao, in particular, became increasingly powerful during Xuanwu&#x27;s reign.

In 500, with Southern Qi in disarray because of the tyrannical rule of its emperor Xiao Baojuan, Northern Wei annexed the important city of Shouyang (壽陽, in modern Lu&#x27;an, Anhui) when the Southern Qi general Pei Shuye (裴叔業) surrendered the city to Northern Wei in fear of adverse actions by Xiao Baojuan. However, Northern Wei did not take further actions when Southern Qi was subsequently thrown into civil war during the rebellions of the generals Cui Huijing (崔慧景) and Xiao Yan.

In 501, the general Yu Lie (于烈) and Yuan Xiang warned Xuanwu that Yuan Xi was growing corrupt and Yuan Xie was growing too popular, and suggested that they be relieved of their posts. Xuanwu did so, and formally personally took over governmental matters, but at his age, he could not actually properly handle governmental affairs himself, so his trusted attendants and Gao Zhao began to become more powerful and corrupt. Traditional historians generally regard this as the starting point of Northern Wei&#x27;s decline. Late in 501, Yuan Xi, displeased that his power wa being stripped and fearful that he would be killed, plotted a rebellion to secede with the provinces south of the Yellow River. His plot was discovered, however, and he was executed. From this point on, Xuanwu grew increasingly suspicious of members of the imperial clan.
On 5 October 501, Xuanwu created Yu Lie&#x27;s niece, Consort Yu, empress.

Later that year, with Xiao Yan&#x27;s forces crushing Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s, Xuanwu&#x27;s general Yuan Ying (元英) suggested that a major attack be launched against Southern Qi to take advantage of Southern Qi&#x27;s civil war. However, Xuanwu only authorized small scale attacks, which were generally fruitless. Xiao Yan soon defeated Xiao Baojuan and by 502 had overthrown Southern Qi and established Liang Dynasty as its Emperor Wu. The Liang general Chen Bozhi (陳伯之) subsequently tried to surrender Jiang Province (江州, modern Jiangxi and Fujian) to Northern Wei, but Liang forces defeated both Chen and the Northern Wei forces sent to reinforce him, and Chen fled to Northern Wei. For the next few years, however, there would continually be war between the two rivals, particularly with Northern Wei creating Southern Qi&#x27;s prince Xiao Baoyin, who fled Southern Qi as Xiao Yan was beginning to kill members of the Southern Qi imperial clan, as the Prince of Qi and announcing that it would help him reestablish Southern Qi.

In 504, Xuan Xiang, who had taken over Yuan Xi&#x27;s posts, was accused by Gao Zhao of corruption. He was demoted to commoner rank, and died soon thereafter. At Gao&#x27;s suggestion and despite Yuan Xie&#x27;s opposition, Xuanwu subsequently put the imperial princes under heavy guard, effectively putting them under house arrest.

Meanwhile, the wars with Liang continued, and while both sides had gains and losses, Northern Wei made a substantial gain in 505 when the Liang general Xiaohou Daoqian (夏侯道遷) surrendered Nanzheng (南鄭, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), as well as the surrounding region, to Northern Wei, which further annexed the semi-independent state Chouchi in spring 506. In winter 505, Liang launched a major counterattack on the eastern part of the border, commanded by Emperor Wu&#x27;s brother Xiao Hong (蕭宏) the Prince of Linchuan, but with Xiao Hong being an incompetent general, who mishandled a night terror situation in summer 506, while his army was at Luokou (洛口, in modern Bengbu, Anhui), the Liang forces collapsed by themselves without engaging Northern Wei forces. Yuan Ying and Xiao Baoyin followed up by attacking the Liang fortress Zhongli (鍾離, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui), but were dealt a crushing defeat by the Liang general Wei Rui (韋叡) in spring 507. The two states largely stopped their military activities against each other after that point.

In winter 507, Empress Yu died suddenly, and in early 508, her young son Yuan Chang (元昌), Xuanwu&#x27;s only son by that point, died suddenly as well. Because Gao Zhao was exceeding powerful by that point, and his niece Consort Gao was Xuanwu&#x27;s favorite concubine, it was largely suspected that Gao Zhao and Gao murdered them, but there was no conclusive proof. In 508, Xuanwu created Gao as Empress to replace Yu, despite opposition by Yuan Xie, and from this point on Gao Zhao became resentful of Yuan Xie.

== Late reign ==

In fall 508, Xuanwu&#x27;s younger brother Yuan Yu (元愉) the Prince of Jingzhao, who had just been demoted by Xuanwu for corruption, became angry at both his demotion and that his favorite consort Lady Li had been severely battered by Empress Yu briefly before Empress Yu&#x27;s death (because Yuan Yu&#x27;s wife was Empress Yu&#x27;s sister but was unfavored by him), declared a rebellion at his provincial post of Xindu (信都, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) and proclaimed himself emperor. Gao Zhao used this opportunity to falsely accuse Yuan Xie of acting in concert with both Yuan Yu (because Yuan Yu had forced Yuan Xie&#x27;s uncle Pan Senggu (潘僧固) into joining his rebellion) and Liang Dynasty. Xuanwu believed Gao, and forced Yuan Xie to commit suicide. The populace and the officials greatly mourned Yuan Xie&#x27;s death, and grew increasingly resentful of Gao. Soon, Yuan Yu&#x27;s rebellion was defeated, and while Xuanwu contemplated not putting Yuan Yu to death, Yuan Yu was killed on Gao&#x27;s orders.

In 510, Xuanwu&#x27;s concubine Consort Hu gave birth to a son, Yuan Xu. Because Xuanwu had lost multiple sons in childhood by that point, he carefully selected several experienced mothers to serve as Yuan Xu&#x27;s wet nurses, and disallowed both Gao and Hu from seeing him. In winter 512, Xuanwu created Yuan Xu crown prince, and, abolishing the Northern Wei custom that the crown prince&#x27;s mother must be forced to commit suicide, he did not force Hu to commit suicide.

During these years, Northern Wei and Liang continued to have relatively minor border battles, with each side having gains and losses. In 514, however, Xuanwu commissioned Gao Zhao to launch a major attack against Liang&#x27;s Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing). Soon thereafter, however, in spring 515, he died suddenly, and Yuan Xu succeeded him (as Emperor Xiaoming). Yuan Cheng, Xuanwu&#x27;s brother Yuan Yong the Prince of Gaoyang, and Yu Lie&#x27;s son Yu Zhong seized power and, after recalling Gao, put him to death, and Gao was removed. Xiaoming&#x27;s mother Hu became empress dowager and regent.

== Burial ==
Xuanwu was buried north of Luoyang. His tomb is now open to the public as part of the Luoyang Ancient Tombs Museum.

<doc id="647636" wikidata="Q27075642" url="?curid=647636" title="Asian brown flycatcher">
<text>The Asian brown flycatcher (Muscicapa dauurica) is a small passerine bird in the flycatcher family Muscicapidae. The word &quot;Muscicapa&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;musca&quot;, a fly and &quot;capere&quot;, to catch. The specific &quot;dauurica&quot; refers to Dauria, an area of south-eastern Siberia named after a local nomadic tribe.

This is an insectivorous species which breeds in Japan, eastern Siberia and the Himalayas. It is migratory and winters in tropical southern Asia from southern India and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia.

The correct specific epithet for this species is disputed.

==Description==
This species is long, including the cocked tail. It is similar in shape to the larger spotted flycatcher, but is relatively longer-tailed. The dark bill is relatively large and broad-based.
The adult has grey-brown upperparts, which become greyer as the plumage ages, and whitish underparts with brown-tinged flanks. Young birds have scaly brown upperparts, head and breast.

==Geographical variation==

Although usually treated as monotypic if the brown-streaked flycatcher is not included, Rasmussen and Anderton, in &quot;Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide&quot; argue that populations in the Indian subcontinent and the Andaman Islands should be regarded as a separate subspecies, &quot;poonensis&quot;, from the nominate race which occupies most of the species&#x27; range. They describe &quot;poonensis&quot; as paler and browner above, with a deeper bill, and mostly pale lower mandible, a more mottled throat, breast and flanks (in fresh plumage), less contrastingly white &quot;spectacles&quot; and throat, and perhaps a more rounded wing.


==Behaviour==
Asian brown flycatcher is a common bird found in open woodland and cultivated areas. It nests in a hole in a tree, laying four eggs which are incubated by the female.

The male Asian brown flycatcher sings a simple melodic song during courtship.

This bird is parasitised by the chewing louse &quot;Philopterus davuricae.&quot;

==Vagrancy==
The Asian brown flycatcher is an extremely rare vagrant to Western Europe. Records have come from Britain, Denmark, and Sweden, and in addition, there are unproven claims from Ireland, Faeroe, and Norway. 

==Britain==

On 3 October 2007 a first winter brown flycatcher was discovered at Flamborough Head, East Riding of Yorkshire which attracted hundreds of birdwatchers during its stay which lasted until dusk of the following day. This looks set to become the first accepted record. A previous record, on Fair Isle, on 1–2 July 1992 was regarded by the BOURC as not definitely of wild origin. A bird had also been claimed on Holy Island, Northumberland on 9 September 1956, but the identification was not accepted beyond doubt.

<text>Hans Werner Henze (1 July 1926 – 27 October 2012) was a German composer. His large oeuvre is extremely varied in style, having been influenced by serialism, atonality, Stravinsky, Italian music, Arabic music and jazz, as well as traditional schools of German composition. In particular, his stage works reflect &quot;his consistent cultivation of music for the theatre throughout his life&quot;.

Henze was also known for his political convictions. He left Germany for Italy in 1953 because of a perceived intolerance towards his leftist politics and homosexuality. Late in life he lived in the village of Marino in the central Italian region of Lazio, and in his final years still travelled extensively, in particular to Britain and Germany, as part of his work. An avowed Marxist and member of the Italian Communist Party, Henze produced compositions honoring Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara. At the 1968 Hamburg premiere of his requiem for Che Guevara, titled &quot;Das Floß der Medusa&quot; (&quot;The Raft of Medusa&quot;), the placing of a red flag on the stage sparked a riot and the arrest of several people, including the librettist. Henze spent a year from 1969 to 1970 teaching in Cuba.

==Life and works==

===Early years===

Henze was born in Gütersloh, Westphalia, the eldest of six children of a teacher, and showed an early interest in art and music. That and his political views led to conflict with his conservative father. Henze&#x27;s father, Franz, had served in the First World War and was wounded at Verdun. He worked as a teacher in a school at Bielefeld, formed on progressive lines, but it was closed in 1933 by government order because its progressive style was out of step with official views. Franz Henze then moved to Dünne, a small village near Bünde, where he fell under the spell of Nazi propaganda. Books by Jewish and Christian authors were replaced in the Henze household by literature reflecting Nazi views; the whole family was expected to fall into line with Franz&#x27;s new thinking. The older boys, including Hans, were enrolled in the Hitler Youth.

Although the Henze household was filled with talk of current affairs, Hans was also able to hear broadcasts of classical music (especially Mozart) and eventually his father realized that his son had a vocation as a musician. Henze began studies at the state music school of Braunschweig in 1942, where he studied piano, percussion, and theory. Franz Henze rejoined the army in 1943 and he was sent to the Eastern front, where he died. Henze had to break off his studies after being conscripted into the army in 1944, towards the end of the Second World War. He was trained as a radio operator. He was soon captured by the British and held in a prisoner-of-war camp for the remainder of the war. In 1945 he became an accompanist in the Bielefeld City Theatre, and continued his studies under Wolfgang Fortner at Heidelberg University in 1946.

Henze had some successful performances at Darmstadt, including an immediate success in 1946 with a neo-baroque work for piano, flute and strings, that brought him to the attention of Schott&#x27;s, the music publishers. He also took part in the famous Darmstadt New Music Summer School, a key vehicle for the propagation of avant-garde techniques. At the 1947 summer school, Henze turned to serial technique.

In his early years he worked with twelve-tone technique, for example in his First Symphony and First Violin Concerto of 1947. Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet visited Hamburg in 1948; this inspired Henze to write a choreographic poem, &quot;Ballett-Variationen&quot;, which he completed in 1949. The first ballet he saw was Frederick Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Scènes de Ballet&quot;. He wrote a letter of appreciation to Ashton, introducing himself as a 22-year-old composer. The next time he wrote to Ashton he enclosed the score of his &quot;Ballett-Variationen&quot;, which he hoped Ashton might find of interest. This work was first performed in Düsseldorf in September 1949 and staged for the first time in Wuppertal in 1958. In 1948 he became musical assistant at the Deutscher Theater in Konstanz, where his first opera &quot;&quot;, based on the work of Cervantes, was created.

In 1950 he became ballet conductor at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden, where he composed two operas for radio, his First Piano Concerto, as well as his first stage work of real note, the jazz-influenced opera &quot;Boulevard Solitude&quot;, a modern recasting of the traditional Manon Lescaut story. His ballet &quot;Ondine&quot; was composed for the English Royal Ballet and choreographed by Ashton, for production in 1958.

===Move to Italy===
Henze left Germany in 1953, in reaction to homophobia and the country&#x27;s general political climate. His publisher, Schott&#x27;s, had also offered Henze an advance on royalties, on condition that he leave his conducting posts to focus on composition. This financial incentive allowed Henze to move to Italy, where he remained for most of his life. He settled on the island of Ischia in the Gulf of Naples. Also residents on the island were the composer William Walton and his wife Susana, who took a great interest in the young German composer. Henze&#x27;s &quot;Quattro poemi&quot; for orchestra in 1955 made clear that he had moved far from the principles of the Darmstadt avant-garde. In January 1956 he left Ischia and moved to the mainland to live in Naples. Initially he suffered further disappointment, with controversial premieres of the opera &quot;König Hirsch&quot;, based on a text by Carlo Gozzi, and the ballet &quot;Maratona di danza&quot;, with a libretto by Luchino Visconti. However, he then began a long-lasting and fruitful creative partnership with the poet Ingeborg Bachmann. Working with her as librettist, he composed the operas &quot;Der Prinz von Homburg&quot; (1958) based on a text by Heinrich von Kleist and &quot;Der junge Lord&quot; (1964) after Wilhelm Hauff, as well as &quot;Serenades and Arias&quot; (1957) and his &quot;Choral Fantasy&quot; (1964).

He composed his &quot;Five Neapolitan Songs&quot; for Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau soon after his arrival in Naples. A later sojourn in Greece provided the opportunity to complete his Hölderlin-based work &quot;Kammermusik 1958&quot;, dedicated to Benjamin Britten and premiered by the tenor Peter Pears, the guitarist Julian Bream and an eight-member chamber ensemble.

Henze moved in 1961 to a secluded villa, &#x27;La Leprara&#x27;, on the hills of Marino, overlooking the River Tiber south of Rome. This time also signalled a strong leaning towards music involving the voice.

From 1962 until 1967, Henze taught masterclasses in composition at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, and in 1967 he became a visiting professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. One of his greatest successes was the premiere of the opera &quot;Die Bassariden&quot; at the Salzburg Festival.

In the following period, he greatly strengthened his political involvement which also influenced his musical work. For example, the première of his oratorio &quot;Das Floß der Medusa&quot; in Hamburg failed when his West Berlin collaborators refused to perform under a portrait of Che Guevara and a revolutionary flag had been placed upon the stage. His politics also influenced his Sixth Symphony (1969), Second Violin Concerto (1971), &quot;Voices&quot; (1973), and his piece for spoken word and chamber orchestra, &quot;El Cimarrón&quot;, based on a book by Cuban author Miguel Barnet about escaped black slaves during Cuba&#x27;s colonial period.

===An established composer===
His political critique reached its high point in 1976 with the premiere of his opera &quot;We Come to the River&quot;.

In the same year Henze founded the &quot;Cantiere Internazionale d&#x27;Arte&quot; in Montepulciano for the promotion of new music, where his children&#x27;s opera &quot;Pollicino&quot; premiered in 1980. From 1980 until 1991 he led a class in composition in the Cologne Music School. In 1981 he founded the Mürztal Workshops in the Austrian region of Styria, the same region where he set up the Deutschlandsberg Youth Music Festival in 1984. In 1988 he founded the Munich Biennale, an &quot;international festival for new music theatre&quot;, of which he was the artistic director.

His own operas became more conventional once more, for example &quot;The English Cat&quot; (1983), and &quot;Das verratene Meer&quot; (1990), based on Yukio Mishima&#x27;s novel &quot;Gogo no Eiko&quot;, known in English as &quot;The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea&quot;.

His later works, while less controversial, continued his political and social engagement. His &quot;Requiem&quot; (1990–93) comprised nine &#x27;sacred concertos&#x27; for piano, trumpet and chamber orchestra, and was written in memory of Michael Vyner, the artistic director of the London Sinfonietta. The choral Ninth Symphony (1997), which is dedicated to the &quot;heroes and martyrs of German anti-fascism,&quot; is set to a libretto by Hans-Ulrich Treichel, based on motifs from the novel &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; by Anna Seghers. It is a rejection of Nazism, which Henze himself had experienced in his youth. His last success was the 2003 premiere of the opera &quot;L&#x27;Upupa und der Triumph der Sohnesliebe&quot; (English: The Hoopoe and the Triumph of Filial Love) at the Salzburg Festival, with a text he wrote himself, based on a Syrian fairy tale. Other late compositions include &quot;Sebastian im Traum&quot; (2004) for large orchestra and the opera &quot;Phaedra&quot; (2007).

Henze lived with his partner Fausto Moroni from the early sixties, and Moroni planned and planted the hillside garden around La Leprara. Moroni cared for the composer when he suffered a nervous breakdown during which he barely spoke and had to be encouraged to eat. In 2007, shortly after Henze&#x27;s sudden recovery, Moroni died after a lengthy battle with cancer. &quot;Elogium Musicum&quot; (2008), for large orchestra and chorus singing Henze&#x27;s own Latin text, is a memorial to his partner of more than forty years.

In 1995 Henze received the Westphalian Music Prize, which has carried his name since 2001. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the tenth composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2000, but owing to illness he did not attend. The music included his &quot;Requiem&quot;. On 7 November 2004, Henze received an honorary doctorate in Musicology from the Hochschule für Musik und Theater München (University for Music and Performing Arts, Munich). In 1975 he became an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music, London. The English version of his autobiography, &quot;Bohemian Fifths&quot;, was published in 1998.

Shortly before Henze&#x27;s death Donald Macleod interviewed him for the BBC Radio 3 series &quot;Composer of the Week&quot; (broadcast ca 2010, including recordings of Henze&#x27;s works). In 2023 extracts from these interviews were rebroadcast in a special series celebrating the eightieth anniversary of the programme.

Henze died in Dresden on 27 October 2012 at the age of 86.

==Works==

Henze&#x27;s music has incorporated neoclassicism, jazz, the twelve-tone technique, serialism, and some rock or popular music. Although he did study atonalism early in his career, after his move to Italy in 1953 Henze&#x27;s music became considerably more Neapolitan in style. His opera &quot;König Hirsch&quot; (&quot;The Stag King&quot;) contains lush, rich textures. This trend is carried further in the opulent ballet music that he wrote for English choreographer Frederick Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Ondine&quot;, completed in 1957. While Mendelssohn and Weber were important influences, the music for &quot;Ondine&quot; contains some jazz and there is much in it redolent of Stravinsky—not only Stravinsky the neo-classical composer, but also the composer of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;. His &quot;Maratona di danza&quot;, on the other hand, required much tighter integration of jazz elements, complete with an on-stage band, which was very different from the more romantic &quot;Ondine&quot;. Henze received much of the impetus for his ballet music from his earlier job as ballet adviser at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden.

The textures for the cantata &quot;Kammermusik&quot; (1958, rev. 1963) are far harsher; Henze returned to atonalism in &quot;Antifone&quot;, and later the other styles mentioned above again became important in his music.

<doc id="647644" wikidata="Q2677208" url="?curid=647644" title="Allegheny Portage Railroad">
<text>The Allegheny Portage Railroad was the first railroad constructed through the Allegheny Mountains in central Pennsylvania. It operated from 1834 to 1854 as the first transportation infrastructure through the gaps of the Allegheny that connected the midwest to the eastern seaboard across the barrier range of the Allegheny Front. Approximately long overall, both ends connected to the Pennsylvania Canal, and the system was primarily used as a portage railway, hauling river boats and barges over the divide between the Ohio and the Susquehanna Rivers. Today, the remains of the railroad are preserved within the Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site operated by the National Park Service.

The railroad was authorized as part of the Main Line of Public Works legislation in 1824. It had five inclines on either side of the drainage divide running athwart the ridge line from Blair Gap through along the kinked saddle at the summit into Cresson, Pennsylvania. The endpoints connected to the Canal at Johnstown on the west through the relative flats to Hollidaysburg on the east. The Railroad utilized cleverly designed wheeled barges to ride a narrow-gauge rail track with steam-powered stationary engines lifting the vehicles. The roadbed of the railroad did not incline monotonically upwards, but rose in relatively long, saw-toothed stretches of slightly-sloped flat terrain suitable to animal powered towing, alternating with steep cable railway inclined planes using static steam engine powered windlasses, similar to mechanisms of modern ski lifts.

Except for peak moments of severe storms, it was an all-weather, all-seasons operation. Along with the rest of the Main Works, it cut transport time from Philadelphia to the Ohio River from weeks to just 3–5 days. Considered a technological marvel in its day, it played a critical role in opening the interior of the United States beyond the Appalachian Mountains to settlement and commerce. It included the first railroad tunnel in the United States, the Staple Bend Tunnel, and its inauguration was marked with great fanfare.

==History==

Construction of the Old Portage Railroad from Hollidaysburg to Johnstown, thirty six miles long, began in 1831 and took three years to complete. It included a tunnel long as well as a viaduct over the Little Conemaugh River upstream from Johnstown. The vertical ascent from Johnstown was . The vertical ascent from Hollidaysburg was . The project was financed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a means to compete with the Erie Canal in New York and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in Maryland. The work was done largely through private contractors. The railroad utilized eleven grade lines and ten cable inclined planes, five on either side of the summit of the Allegheny Ridge, to carry loaded canal boats on flatbed railroad cars. Trains of two-three cars were pulled on grade lines by mules. On inclined planes, stationary steam engines pulled up and lowered down cars by hemp ropes switching to wire ropes in 1842.

The entire Main Line system connecting Philadelphia and Pittsburgh via the Philadelphia-Columbia railroad, the Columbia-Hollidaysburg canal, the Portage railroad linking Hollidaysburg to Johnstown, and a canal from Johnstown to Pittsburgh, was long. A typical ride took 4 days instead of the former 23-day horse-wagon journey. The Old Portage Railroad was in operation for twenty years being considered &quot;the wonder of America.&quot; Charles Dickens wrote a contemporary account of travel on the railroad in Chapter 10 of his &quot;American Notes.&quot; Quoted at length in the Pennsylvania guide, Dickens &quot;described travel on the Portage in 1842,&quot; describing aspects of the Portage Railroad&#x27;s immediate social and geographic context, as well as mechanical strategies used by the Railroad for coping with the steep grades encountered on the route :

In the 1850s, the Main Line of Public Works and its portage railroad was rendered obsolete by the advance of railway technology and railroad engineering. Early in 1846 the Legislature chartered the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) to cross the entire state in response to plans by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to reach the Ohio Valley through Virginia. In December 1852 trains started to run between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh shortening the travel time from 4 days to 13 hours.

Construction on the New Portage Railroad, a 40-mile realignment to cross the Allegheny Ridge bypassing inclines, started in 1851 and cost $2.14 million. The PRR raised sufficient investment and had enough quick success that they bought the existing Portage railroad and other parts of the Main Line of Public Works from the state on July 31, 1857. The PRR abandoned most of the line and used the rest as local branches; &quot;anything of value was either sold or stripped from the Allegheny Portage Railroad.&quot;

Nearly half a century later, the graded roadbeds of the descending section east of the Gallitzin Tunnel were re-railed with standard gauge freight tracks. The line reopened as a freight bypass line in 1904.

Pennsylvania Railroad successor Conrail abandoned this line to Hollidaysburg and most of the branch trackage along the Juniata River in 1981 and removed the rails. The Allegheny Portage Railroad was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1987.

==National Historic Site==
The National Historic Site was established on in 1964 and is about west of Altoona, in Blair and Cambria counties. The National Park Service operates a visitor center with interpretive exhibits near the old line. Nearby is the Samuel Lemon House, a tavern located alongside the railroad near Cresson that was a popular stop for railroad passengers; it has been converted into a historical museum by the National Park Service. The NPS also maintains a length of reconstructed track, an engine house with exhibits, a picnic area, and hiking trails.

A skew arch bridge, a masterwork of cut stone construction, is another feature of the site near the Lemon House. The bridge is long on the south elevation, long on the north elevation, and high. It was the only bridge on the line that was built to carry a road. The Staple Bend Tunnel is preserved in a separate unit of the historic site, east of Johnstown.

<doc id="647645" wikidata="Q6661269" url="?curid=647645" title="Cheng (surname)">
<text>Cheng can be a transcription of one of several Chinese surnames. Since the syllable &quot;Cheng&quot; represents different sounds in Hanyu pinyin and the Wade–Giles systems of Chinese romanization, some ambiguity will exist as to which sound is represented by the letters &quot;Cheng&quot; if the romanisation and tone is not known. Also within each system of romanisation, each syllable can represent one of several different characters, as with any Chinese syllable.

In the pinyin system of romanization (usually used in China), the most common surnames romanized as &quot;Cheng&quot; are 程 and 成. In 2019 程 was the 44th most common surname in Mainland China.

In names romanized in Wade–Giles (usually used in Taiwan), &quot;Cheng&quot; is most commonly a transcription of 鄭/郑 (pinyin Zhèng). &quot;Cheng&quot; can also be the Cantonese version of Zheng (鄭) and Jing (井), non-standard romanization of Cen (岑), and Teochew or Hokkien pronunciation of Zhong (鍾) and Zhuang (莊).

Further confusion arises because Wade–Giles often appears without the required apostrophes (which indicates aspiration), and thus some Wade–Giles names which are properly romanized &quot;Ch&#x27;eng&quot; (such as 程 pinyin Chéng) will appear as &quot;Cheng&quot;.

==Origins==
There are a number of accounts of the origin of the same 成 (Chéng) surname. It was the name of fiefdom Cheng (郕) in Henan belong to Shu Wu, a son of King Wen of Zhou. His descendants adopted the name Cheng, simplifying it to 成 by dropping the radical. Similarly descendants of Ji Zai, who was granted another fief of the same name in Shandong by King Wu of Zhou, also simplified the name and adopted it as their surname. The name may also be derived from a fief of the name Cheng 成 in the state of Lu. Descendants of a Cheng Hu (成虎), son of the ruler of Chu Ruo&#x27;ao, also adopted Cheng as their surname. Others are descendants of Tu Ge invaders and other tribes in China.

The Chéng (程) surname may have come from a fief named Cheng in Henan, as well as another in Shaanxi.

See article on Zheng for the origins of the surname Zheng (鄭).

== Notable people surnamed 成 ==
* Cheng Dechen, general of the Chu state in the Spring and Autumn period
* Cheng Yi, Chinese actor and singer
== Forename ==
Additionally, depending on the character, Cheng can be a forename. Cheng usually is only seen to be applied to the last name due to the meaning and nature of the chosen &#x27;Cheng&#x27;, if it was &#x27;成&#x27; where it means &#x27;to become&#x27; then it is suited best as a last name as it symbolises a foreseeing connotation and would make more sense at the end of a name, but also in Chinese name layout, the last name is usually said first. whereas if it were &#x27;澄&#x27; meaning &#x27;clarity&#x27;, then it would be more likely seen as a first name, this usually appears in the middle of the name in Chinese format.

<text>Jack Hearn Watson Jr. (born October 24, 1938) is an American corporate strategist and political aide who served as White House Chief of Staff to President Jimmy Carter from 1980 to 1981.

== Personal life ==
Watson is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Vanderbilt University and received his law degree from Harvard Law School. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a Pathfinder and Reconnaissance Team Leader, 1st Force Reconnaissance Company, and left the Marine Corps with the rank of captain. He met his first wife at Vanderbilt, married in 1972 and had two children, Lincoln and Melissa. They divorced and he married Teena Watson in 1977.

== Career ==
He served as head of the Carter-Mondale Policy Planning Group in 1976, and later was Director of the Transition Team during the transition of government from President Ford to President Carter. In the Carter administration from 1977 to 1981, he served as Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs, Secretary to the Cabinet, and White House Chief of Staff. He chaired the President&#x27;s Interagency Coordinating Council created by Executive Order in 1978 to coordinate implementation of the President&#x27;s domestic policy.

Watson had earlier been a protege of Charles Kirbo and a highly successful trial lawyer at King &amp; Spalding in Atlanta. He had served as a close aide to Carter during his gubernatorial campaigns and was particularly close to Carter’s mother, “Miss Lillian.” Charismatic, classy and inspirational, Watson characteristically told transition staff at its first meeting in Washington, D.C. following the 1976 election that when working with Executive Branch employees they should view them, not suspiciously, but “as all Carter people.”

== Post–Carter Administration ==
From January 1998 to June 2000, he served as Chief Legal Strategist of Monsanto Company.

<text>A mobile browser is a web browser designed for use on a mobile device such as a mobile phone, PDA, smartphone, or tablet. Mobile browsers are optimized to display web content most effectively on small screens on portable devices. Some mobile browsers, especially older versions, are designed to be small and efficient to accommodate the low memory capacity and low bandwidth of certain wireless handheld devices. Traditional smaller feature phones use stripped-down mobile web browsers; however, most current smartphones have full-fledged browsers that can handle the latest web technologies, such as CSS 3, JavaScript, and Ajax.

Websites designed to be usable in mobile browsers may be collectively referred to as the mobile web. Today, over 75% of websites are &quot;mobile friendly&quot;, by detecting when a request comes from a mobile device and automatically creating a &quot;mobile&quot; version of the page, designed to fit the device&#x27;s screen and be usable with a touch interface.

==Underlying technology==
The mobile browser usually connects via the cellular network, or increasingly via Wireless LAN, using standard HTTP over TCP/IP and displays web pages written in HTML. Historically, early feature phones were restricted to only displaying pages specifically designed for mobile use, written in XHTML Mobile Profile (WAP 2.0), or WML (which evolved from HDML). WML and HDML are stripped-down formats suitable for transmission across limited bandwidth, and wireless data connection called WAP. In Japan, DoCoMo defined the i-mode service based on i-mode HTML, which is an extension of Compact HTML (C-HTML), a simple subset of HTML.

WAP 2.0 specifies XHTML Mobile Profile plus WAP CSS, subsets of the W3C&#x27;s standard XHTML and CSS with minor mobile extensions.

Smartphone mobile browsers are full-featured Web browsers capable of HTML, CSS, ECMAScript, as well as mobile technologies such as WML, i-mode HTML, or cHTML.
To accommodate small screens, they use Post-WIMP interfaces.

==History==
The first mobile browser for a PDA was PocketWeb for the Apple Newton created at TecO in 1994, followed by the first commercial product NetHopper released in August 1996.

The so-called &quot;microbrowser&quot; technologies such as WAP, NTTDocomo&#x27;s i-mode platform and Openwave&#x27;s HDML platform fueled the first wave of interest in wireless data services.

The first deployment of a mobile browser on a mobile phone was probably in 1997 when Unwired Planet (later to become Openwave) put their &quot;UP.Browser&quot; on AT&amp;T handsets to give users access to HDML content.

A British company, STNC Ltd., developed a mobile browser (HitchHiker) in 1997 that was intended to present the entire device UI. The demonstration platform for this mobile browser (Webwalker) had 1 MIPS total processing power. This was a single core platform, running the GSM stack on the same processor as the application stack. In 1999 STNC was acquired by Microsoft and HitchHiker became Microsoft Mobile Explorer 2.0, not related to the primitive Microsoft Mobile Explorer 1.0. HitchHiker is believed to be the first mobile browser with a unified rendering model, handling HTML and WAP along with ECMAScript, WMLScript, POP3 and IMAP mail in a single client. Although it was not used, it was possible to combine HTML and WAP in the same pages although this would render the pages invalid for any other device. Mobile Explorer 2.0 was available on the Benefon Q, Sony CMD-Z5, CMD-J5, CMD-MZ5, CMD-J6, CMD-Z7, CMD-J7 and CMD-J70. With the addition of a messaging kernel and a driver model, this was powerful enough to be the operating system for certain embedded devices. One such device was the Amstrad e-m@iler and e-m@iler 2. This code formed the basis for MME3.

Multiple companies offered browsers for the Palm OS platform. The first HTML browser for Palm OS 1.0 was HandWeb by Smartcode software, released in 1997. HandWeb included its own TCP/IP stack, and Smartcode was acquired by Palm in 1999. Mobile browsers for the Palm OS platform multiplied after the release of Palm OS 2.0, which included a TCP/IP stack. A freeware (although later shareware) browser for the Palm OS was Palmscape, written in 1998 by Kazuho Oku in Japan, who went on to found Ilinx. It was still in limited use as late as 2003. Qualcomm also developed the Eudora Web browser, and launched it with the Palm OS based QCP smartphone. ProxiWeb was a proxy-based Web browsing solution, developed by Ian Goldberg and others at the University of California, Berkeley and later acquired by PumaTech.

Released in 2001, Mobile Explorer 3.0 added iMode compatibility (cHTML) plus numerous proprietary schemes. By imaginatively combining these proprietary schemes with WAP protocols, MME3.0 implemented OTA database synchronisation, push email, push information clients (not unlike a &#x27;Today Screen&#x27;) and PIM functionality. The cancelled Sony Ericsson CMD-Z700 was to feature heavy integration with MME3.0. Although Mobile Explorer was ahead of its time in the mobile phone space, development was stopped in 2002.

Also in 2002, Palm, Inc. offered Web Pro on Tungsten PDAs based upon a Novarra browser. PalmSource offered a competing Web browser based on Access NetFront.

Opera software pioneered with its Small Screen Rendering and Medium Screen Rendering technology. The Opera web browser is able to reformat regular web pages for optimal fit on small screens and medium-sized (PDA) screens. It was also the first widely available mobile browser to support Ajax and the first mobile browser to pass the Acid2 test.

Distinct from a mobile browser is a web-based emulator, which uses a &quot;Virtual Handset&quot; to display WAP pages on a computer screen, implemented either in Java or as an HTML transcoder.

==Popular mobile browsers==
The following are some of the more popular mobile browsers. Some mobile browsers are really miniaturized web browsers, so some mobile device providers also provide browsers for desktop and laptop computers.
===Default browsers for mobile and tablet (current and defunct)===
===User-installable mobile browsers (current and defunct)===
===Mobile HTML transcoders===
Mobile transcoders reformat and compress web content for mobile devices and must be used in conjunction with built-in or user-installed mobile browsers. The following are several leading mobile transcoding services.
* Openwave Web Adapter - used by Vodacom
* Vision Mobile Server
* Skweezer - used by Orange, Etisalat, JumpTap, Medio, Miva, and others
* Opera Mini

====Defunct transcoders or sites with removed transcoding functionality====

* Google Mobilizer (Google Web Transcoder) — Defunct since February 2016. Replaced with Google Web Light.
* Smartphone site — The last extant snapshot of the site is from 5 September 2012.
* Device-Browser combinations on Cloud 
* Finch — The last snapshot of a functional Finch site is from 28 February 2009. This defunct service should not be confused with Finch (software). Finch the transcoder became Squeezr!Beta as early as 8 December 2009.
**Squeezr!Beta — The last functional Squeezr!Beta page is dated 13 February 2010. As of 28 August 2010, Squeezr!Beta had closed; the last page of Squeezr as authored by Adam Brenecki is dated 2 January 2012. Since 2013, squeezr.net redirected to squeezr.it, which is a different service, and not related to Adam Brenecki.
* Microsoft Bing — the option to enable or disable &quot;Optimize web pages for your phone&quot; in &quot;Search settings&quot; is not visible in Bing&#x27;s mobile version as of March 2018. (The mobile version can be accessed with a phone or tablet, or when setting a web browser to identify itself with a mobile-based user agent string.)
* MobileLeap Transcoding Engine, by MobileLeap Inc. As of March 2018, web page source code includes JavaScript from the domain parking company Sedo — The site would not allow entry without a cookie, so a typical crawler would be redirected to mlvb&#x27;s cookiecheck page, the last snapshot of which is from 12 October 2017.
* Mowser (mowser.com) — Alternately marketed with the mowser.mobi domain name, which is now a permanent deadlink. The last snapshot of a working page is dated 22 September 2017. As of 30 March 2018, the site has been shut down.

<doc id="647651" wikidata="Q775070" url="?curid=647651" title="Sherman Adams">
<text>Llewelyn Sherman Adams (January 8, 1899 – October 27, 1986) was an American businessman and politician, best known as White House Chief of Staff for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the culmination of an 18-year political career that also included a stint as the 67th governor of New Hampshire. He lost his White House position in a scandal when he accepted an expensive vicuña coat.

==Early life==
Born in East Dover, Vermont to grocer Clyde H. Adams and Winnie Marion Sherman, Adams was educated in public schools in Providence, Rhode Island, graduating from Hope High School. He received an undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College (1920), having taken time off briefly for a six-month World War I stint in the United States Marine Corps. While at Dartmouth, Adams helped found Cabin and Trail, Dartmouth&#x27;s influential hiking club, and was a member of the New Hampshire Alpha chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He then went into the lumber business, first in Healdville, Vermont (1921), then to a combined lumber and paper business in Lincoln, New Hampshire. He also was involved in banking.

==Political beginnings==
Adams entered state politics in New Hampshire as a Republican legislator (1941–44; Speaker of the House, 1944). He served a term in the United States House of Representatives (1945–47), making a failed effort to capture the 1946 Republican gubernatorial nomination in New Hampshire. He lost to incumbent Charles M. Dale. Adams won the governorship two years later, in 1948.

==New Hampshire governorship==
When Adams took office as governor, New Hampshire was suffering post-war recession. He called for frugality and thrift in both personal and state expenditures. Retirees were (and are) a significant part of New Hampshire&#x27;s population; Adams called for increased state aid for the aged, and for legislation which would enable the state&#x27;s seniors to qualify for Federal Old Age &amp; Survivors Insurance. In 1950 he formed a Reorganization Committee to recommend changes in state operations, and he called for the legislature to act on the recommendations. It was during his time as Governor that the New Hampshire Right to Work law (which prevented people being forced to join unions) was repealed.

Adams&#x27;s clipped New Hampshire twang and calls for frugality made him a virtual poster boy for Republican balanced budget values of the time. He served as chairman of the U.S. Conference of Governors (1951–52).

==1952 campaign==
Adams took charge of the Eisenhower campaign in the New Hampshire primary, winning all the delegates to the national convention. He campaigned for Eisenhower across the country, was Eisenhower&#x27;s floor leader at the convention in battling against Senator Robert A. Taft, and impressed Eisenhower with his hard work, mastery of detail, and skill in political maneuvering. He became the campaign manager for the 1952 presidential campaign, where he was always at Eisenhower&#x27;s side. He was the obvious choice for White House Chief of Staff—and was the first person in this position to hold the explicit title of &quot;Chief of Staff,&quot; which Eisenhower had copied from military practice.

==White House Chief of Staff==
Eisenhower adopted the military model, which emphasizes the importance of the Chief of Staff in handling all of the paperwork and preliminary decisions. With rare exceptions, anyone who spoke with Eisenhower had to have Adams&#x27; prior approval. Adams took his role as Chief of Staff very seriously; with the exception of Cabinet members and certain NSC advisors, all requests for access to Eisenhower had to go through his office. This alienated traditional Republican Party leaders.

Adams was one of the most powerful men in Washington during the six years he served as chief of staff. Because of Eisenhower&#x27;s highly formalized staff structure, it appeared to many that he had virtual control over White House staff operations and domestic policy (a 1956 article in &quot;Time&quot; entitled &quot;OK, S.A.&quot; advanced this perception). The extent of internal strife between strong-willed personalities was chronicled in his 1961 memoir &quot;First Hand Report.&quot; Among the heated conflicts within the Eisenhower administration were the best method to handle flamboyant personalities such as U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, whom Adams and Eisenhower decided to torpedo when McCarthy started attacking the U.S. Army. Adams was a frequent broker of such controversies. Adams was willing to make the partisan comments that Eisenhower stood aloof from, thus making Adams the main target of the Democrats. Adams generally stood with the liberal wing of the Republican Party, in opposition to the conservative wing of Taft and Barry Goldwater. Eisenhower often depended upon him for the evaluation of candidates for top-level appointments. Adams handled much of the patronage and appointments that Eisenhower found boring and also was in charge of firing people when he deemed it necessary.

Movie critic Michael Medved wrote a book on Presidential aides called &quot;The Shadow Presidents,&quot; that stated Adams was probably the most powerful chief of staff in history. He told of a joke that circulated around Washington in the 1950s. Two Democrats were talking and one said &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be terrible if Eisenhower died and Nixon became President?&quot; The other replied &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be terrible if Sherman Adams died and Eisenhower became President!&quot;

He had a reputation for negativity, endorsing many submissions with a simple &quot;No&quot;. This caused him to become known as &quot;The Abominable No Man.&quot;

===Scandal===
Adams was forced to resign in 1958, when a House subcommittee revealed Adams had accepted an expensive vicuña overcoat and oriental rug from Bernard Goldfine, a Boston textile manufacturer who was being investigated for Federal Trade Commission violations. Goldfine, who had business with the federal government, was cited for contempt of Congress when he refused to answer questions regarding his relationship with Adams. The story was first reported to the public by muckraking journalist Jack Anderson.

Vice President Richard Nixon stated that he was assigned the onerous responsibility of telling Adams that he had to resign. He regretted the necessity, as Adams&#x27; career in politics ended and he went off &quot;to operate a ski lodge&quot; without any judicial findings. In the Nixon Interviews, Nixon argued that he was unable to fire the White House staffers involved in the Watergate scandal, much as President Eisenhower was unable to directly fire Adams. However, according to &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s September 29, 1958, article on Adams, the job of firing Adams actually fell to Meade Alcorn, not Nixon.

==Post-political life==
Adams returned to Lincoln, New Hampshire where he started construction on Loon Mountain, today one of the largest ski resorts in New England. He was also a member of the Society of Colonial Wars and the Sons of the American Revolution.

Adams died in 1986. His remains are buried at Riverside Cemetery, also in Lincoln.

==Family==
Adams was married to Rachel Leona White in 1923. They had one son, Samuel, and three daughters, Jean, Sarah and Marion.

<doc id="647655" wikidata="Q2978742" url="?curid=647655" title="Clean Water Act">
<text>The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary federal law in the United States governing water pollution. Its objective is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation&#x27;s waters; recognizing the responsibilities of the states in addressing pollution and providing assistance to states to do so, including funding for publicly owned treatment works for the improvement of wastewater treatment; and maintaining the integrity of wetlands.

The Clean Water Act was one of the United States&#x27; first and most influential modern environmental laws. Its laws and regulations are primarily administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in coordination with state governments, though some of its provisions, such as those involving filling or dredging, are administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Its implementing regulations are codified at 40 C.F.R. Subchapters D, N, and O (Parts 100–140, 401–471, and 501–503).

Technically, the name of the law is the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The first FWPCA was enacted in 1948, but took on its modern form when completely rewritten in 1972 in an act entitled the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. Major changes have subsequently been introduced via amendatory legislation including the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act (WQA) of 1987.

The Clean Water Act does not directly address groundwater contamination. Groundwater protection provisions are included in the Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Superfund act.

==Background==
=== Health implications of water pollution ===
Contamination of drinking water supplies can not only occur in the source water but also in the distribution system. Sources of water contamination include naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (arsenic, radon, uranium), local land use practices (fertilizers, pesticides, concentrated feeding operations), manufacturing processes, and sewer overflows or wastewater releases. Some examples of health implications of water contamination are gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people whose immune systems are compromised because of AIDS, chemotherapy, or transplant medications, may be especially susceptible to illness from some contaminants.

==== Gastrointestinal illness ====
Gastrointestinal disorders include such conditions as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, perianal abscesses, anal fistulas, perianal infections, diverticular diseases, colitis, colon polyps and cancer. In general, children and the elderly are at highest risk for gastrointestinal disease. In a study investigating the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of Philadelphia, scientists found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was negatively associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile range increase in turbidity being associated with a 9% increase
. The association was stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65–74. This example is a small reflection of residents of the United States remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices.

==== Reproductive problems ====
Reproductive problems refer to any illness of the reproductive system. New research by Brunel University and the University of Exeter strengthens the relationship between water pollution and rising male fertility problems. Study identified a group of chemicals that act as anti-androgens in polluted water, which inhibits the function of the male hormone, testosterone, reducing male fertility.

==== Neurological disorders ====
Neurological disorders are diseases of the brain, spine and the nerves that connect them. The new study of more than 700 people in California&#x27;s Central Valley found that those who likely consumed contaminated private well water had a higher rate of Parkinson&#x27;s. The risk was 90 percent higher for those who had private wells near fields sprayed with widely used insecticides. Unlike water supplies in large cities, private wells are mostly unregulated and are not monitored for contaminants. Many of them exist at shallow depths of less than 20 yards, and some of the crop chemicals used to kill pests and weeds can flow into ground water. Therefore, private wells are likely to contain pesticides, which can attack developing brains (womb or infancy), leading to neurological diseases later in life. A study led by UCLA epidemiology professor Beate Ritz suggests that &quot;people with Parkinson&#x27;s were more likely to have consumed private well water, and had consumed it on average 4.3 years longer than those who did not have the disease.&quot;
==Waters protected==
Under the current Supreme Court rule issued in 2023, all waters (such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes) with &quot;a continuous surface connection&quot; to &quot;navigable waters&quot; are covered under the CWA. 

The 1972 statute frequently uses the term &quot;navigable waters&quot; but also defines the term as &quot;waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.&quot; Regulations interpreting the 1972 law have included water features such as intermittent streams, playa lakes, prairie potholes, sloughs and wetlands as &quot;waters of the United States.&quot; In 2006, in &quot;Rapanos v. United States&quot;, a plurality of the US Supreme Court authored by Justice Antonin Scalia held that the term &quot;waters of the United States&quot; &quot;includes only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water &#x27;forming geographic features&#x27; that are described in ordinary parlance as &#x27;streams[,]... oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.&#x27;&quot; The concurrent written opinion of Justice Anthony Kennedy defined the term more broadly, including wetlands with a &quot;significant nexus&quot; to traditionally-defined navigable waters. Since &quot;Rapanos&quot;, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have attempted to define protected waters in the context of &quot;Rapanos&quot; through the 2015 Clean Water Rule, but this has been highly controversial. The agencies considered the CWA to cover bodies of water with a &quot;significant nexus&quot; with traditional navigable waters, according with Justice Kennedy&#x27;s definition. 

In 2023, the Supreme Court rejected the &quot;significant nexus&quot; test in &quot;Sackett v. EPA&quot; and established the current definition.

== Pollution control strategy ==
=== Point sources ===
The CWA introduced the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), a permit system for regulating point sources of pollution. Point sources include:
* Industrial facilities (including manufacturing, mining, shipping activities, oil and gas extraction and service industries).
* Municipal governments (particularly sewage treatment plants) and other government facilities (such as military bases), and
* Some agricultural facilities, such as animal feedlots.
Point sources may not discharge pollutants to surface waters without an NPDES permit. The system is managed by EPA in partnership with state environmental agencies. EPA has authorized 47 states to issue permits directly to the discharging facilities. The CWA also allows tribes to issue permits, but no tribes have been authorized by EPA. In the remaining states and territories, the permits are issued by an EPA regional office. (See Titles III and IV.)

In legislation prior to 1972, Congress had authorized states to develop water quality standards, which would limit discharges from facilities based on the characteristics of individual water bodies. However, those standards were to be developed only for interstate waters, and the science to support that process (i.e. data, methodology) was in the early stages of development. That system was not effective, and there was no permit system in place to enforce the requirements. In the 1972 CWA, Congress added the permit system and a requirement for technology-based effluent limitations.

In the 2020 Supreme Court case &quot;County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund&quot;, the Court also validated that some discharges may not be point sources, but are the &quot;functional equivalent of a direct discharge&quot; to navigable waters, such as in this case, the injection of wastewater into groundwater injection wells. As of the time of the case&#x27;s decision, this was not an area the EPA has established regulations for, and the Court instructed the EPA to work with the courts to define such functional equivalents. The Court wrote that this would likely depend most on the distance the pollutants traveled and time to reach navigable waters, with consideration for the material that the pollutants traveled through, any physical or chemical interaction of the pollutants with components in the ground, and how much of the pollutant makes it to the navigable water. In July 2021, following the Supreme Court decision, the Hawaii District Court determined that the Maui County sewage treatment plant&#x27;s groundwater injection of sewage was the &quot;functional equivalent of a direct discharge&quot; and required the plant to obtain an NPDES permit.

==== Technology-based standards ====
The 1972 CWA created a new requirement for technology-based standards for point source discharges. EPA develops those standards for categories of dischargers, based on the performance of pollution control technologies without regard to the conditions of a particular receiving water body. The intent of Congress was to create a &quot;level playing field&quot; by establishing a basic national discharge standard for all facilities within a category, using a &quot;Best Available Technology.&quot; The standard becomes the minimum regulatory requirement in a permit. If the national standard is not sufficiently protective at a particular location, then water quality standards may be employed, and the permit authority (state or EPA) will include water quality-based effluent limitations in the permit.

==== Water quality standards ====
The 1972 act authorized continued use of the water quality-based approach, but in coordination with the technology-based standards. After application of technology-based standards to a permit, if water quality is still impaired for the particular water body, then the permit agency may add water quality-based limitations to that permit. The additional limitations are to be more stringent than the technology-based limitations and would require the permittee to install additional controls. Water quality standards consist of four basic elements: 1) Designated uses; 2) Water quality criteria; 3) Antidegradation policy and 4) General policies.

=====Designated uses=====
The water quality standards regulations require states and federally recognized tribes/nations to specify appropriate uses for water bodies in their jurisdiction. Identification of appropriate water uses takes into consideration the usage and value of public water supply, protection of fish, wildlife, recreational waters, agricultural, industrial and navigational water ways. Suitability of a water body is examined by states and tribes/nations usages based on physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. States and tribes/nations also examine geographical settings, scenic qualities and economic considerations to determine fitness of designated uses for water bodies. If those standards indicate designated uses to be less than those currently attained, states or tribes are required to revise standards to reflect the uses that are actually being attained. For any body of water with designated uses that do not include &quot;fishable/swimmable&quot; target use that is identified in section 101(a)(2) of CWA, a &quot;Use Attainability Analysis&quot; must be conducted. Every three years, such bodies of water must be re-examined to verify if new information is available that demand a revision of the standard. If new information is available that specify &quot;fishable/swimmable&quot; uses can be attained, the use must be designated.

=====Water quality criteria=====
States and federally recognized Indigenous Nations protect their designated areas by adopting water quality criteria that the EPA publishes under CWA section 304(a), modifying the criteria to reflect site-specific conditions or adopting criteria based on other scientifically defensible methods. Water quality criteria can be numeric criteria that toxicity causes are known for protection against pollutants. A narrative criterion is water quality criteria which serves as a basis for limiting the toxicity of waste discharges to aquatic species. A biological criterion is based on the aquatic community which describes the number and types of species in a water body. A nutrient criterion solely protects against nutrient over enrichment, and a sediment criterion describes conditions of contaminated and uncontaminated sediments to avoid undesirable effects.

=====Anti-degradation policy=====
The water quality regulations include an anti-degradation policy that requires states and tribes to establish a three-tiered anti-degradation program. Anti-degradation procedures identify steps and questions that need to be addressed when specific activities affect water quality. &quot;Tier 1&quot; requirements are applicable to all surface waters. These requirements maintain and protect current uses and the water quality conditions to support existing uses. Current uses are identified by showing that fishing, swimming, and other water uses have occurred and are suitable since November 28, 1975. &quot;Tier 2&quot; requirements maintains and protects water bodies with existing conditions that are better to support &quot;fishable/swimmable&quot; uses pursuant to CWA section 101(a)(2). &quot;Tier 3&quot; requirements maintain and protect water quality in &quot;outstanding national resource waters&quot; (ONRWs), which are the highest quality waters in the US with ecological significance.

=====General policies=====
States and Native American tribes also adopt general policies pertaining to water quality standards that are subject to review and approval by the EPA. Those provisions on water quality standards include mixing zones, variance, and low flow policies. Mixing zone policy is defined area surrounding a point source discharge where sewage is diluted by water. Methodology of mixing zone procedure determines the location, size, shape and quality of mixing zones. Variance policy temporarily relax water quality standard and are alternatives to removing a designated use. States and tribes may include variance as part of their water quality standard. Variance is subject to public review every three years and warrant development towards improvement of water quality. The &quot;Low Flow&quot; policy pertains to states and tribes water quality standards that identify procedures applied to determining critical low flow conditions.

==== Laboratory test methods ====
Most NPDES permittees are required to collect samples of their wastewater and analyze the samples using test methods specified in their permits. EPA publishes analytical methods that are used by the permittees. The procedures identify chemical compounds and microbiological components of wastewater, as required by the act. Some of the chemical compound test procedures include the chemical detection of trace elements such as cancer-causing metals. Some microbiological test procedures use microbial source tracking (MST) techniques to calculate and identify biological and chemical trends that may support new regulatory limits on pollutants.

=== Nonpoint sources ===

Congress exempted some water pollution sources from the point source definition in the 1972 CWA and was unclear on the status of some other sources. Such sources were therefore considered to be nonpoint sources that were not subject to the permit program.

Agricultural stormwater discharges and irrigation return flows were specifically exempted from permit requirements. Congress, however, provided support for research, technical and financial assistance programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to improve runoff management practices on farms. &quot;See&quot; Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Stormwater runoff from industrial sources, municipal storm drains, and other sources were not specifically addressed in the 1972 law. EPA had declined to include urban runoff and industrial stormwater discharges in its initial implementation of the NPDES program, and subsequently the agency was sued by an environmental group. In 1977, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that stormwater discharges must be covered by the permit program.

Research conducted starting in the late 1970s and 1980s indicated that stormwater runoff was a significant cause of water quality impairment in many parts of the US. In the early 1980s, the EPA conducted the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (NURP) to document the extent of the urban stormwater problem. The agency began to develop regulations for stormwater permit coverage but encountered resistance from industry and municipalities, and there were additional rounds of litigation. The litigation was pending when Congress considered further amendments to the CWA in 1986.

In the Water Quality Act of 1987, Congress responded to the stormwater problem by defining industrial stormwater dischargers and municipal separate storm sewer systems (often called &quot;MS4&quot;) as point sources, and requiring them to obtain NPDES permits, by specific deadlines. The permit exemption for agricultural discharges continued, but Congress created several programs and grants, including a demonstration grant program at the EPA to expand the research and development of non-point controls and management practices.

=== Financing of pollution controls ===
Congress created a major public works financing program for municipal sewage treatment in the 1972 CWA. A system of grants for construction of municipal sewage treatment plants was authorized and funded in Title II. In the initial program, the federal portion of each grant was up to 75 percent of a facility&#x27;s capital cost, with the remainder financed by the state. In subsequent amendments Congress reduced the federal proportion of the grants and in the 1987 WQA transitioned to a revolving loan program in Title VI. Industrial and other private facilities are required to finance their own treatment improvements based on the polluter pays principle.

==== Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act ====
Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) to provide an expanded credit program for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, with broader eligibility criteria than the previously authorized revolving fund unter CWA Title VI. Pursuant to WIFIA, EPA established its Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center in 2015 to help local governments and municipal utilities design innovative financing mechanisms, including public–private partnerships. Congress amended the WIFIA program in 2015, 2016 and 2018.

== Major statutory provisions ==
This Act has six titles.

=== Title I - Research and Related Programs ===
Title I includes a &quot;Declaration of Goals and Policy&quot; and various grant authorizations for research programs and pollution control programs. Some of the programs authorized by the 1972 law are ongoing (e.g. section 104 research programs, section 106 pollution control programs, section 117 Chesapeake Bay Program) while other programs no longer receive funds from Congress and have been discontinued.

=== Title II - Grants for Construction of Treatment Works ===

To assist municipalities in building or expanding sewage treatment plants, also known as publicly owned treatment works (POTW), Title II established a system of construction grants. The 1972 CWA provided that federal funds would support 75% of project costs, with state and local funds providing the remaining 25%. In 1981 Congress reduced the federal funding proportion for most grants to 55%.

The construction grant program was replaced by the Clean Water State Revolving Fund in the 1987 WQA (&quot;see&quot; Title VI), although some local utilities continued to receive &quot;special purpose project grants&quot; directly from Congress, through a budgetary procedure known as &quot;earmarking.&quot;

=== Title III - Standards and enforcement ===

====Discharge permits required====
Section 301 of the Act prohibits discharges to waters of the U.S. except with a permit. 
(&quot;See&quot; Title IV for discussion of permit programs.) Recreational vessels are exempt from the permit requirements, but vessel operators must implement Best Management Practices to control their discharges. (&quot;See&quot; Regulation of ship pollution in the United States.)

==== Technology-Based Standards Program ====
Under the 1972 act EPA began to issue technology-based standards for municipal and industrial sources:
* Municipal sewage treatment plants (POTW) are required to meet secondary treatment standards.
* Effluent guidelines (for existing sources) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are issued for categories of industrial facilities discharging directly to surface waters.
* Categorical Pretreatment Standards are issued to industrial users (also called &quot;indirect dischargers&quot;) contributing wastes to POTW. These standards are developed in conjunction with the effluent guidelines program. As with effluent guidelines and NSPS, pretreatment standards consists of Pretreatment Standards for Existing Sources (PSES) and Pretreatment Standards for New Sources (PSNS). There are 28 categories with pretreatment standards as of 2023.

As of 2023 the effluent guidelines and categorical pretreatment standards regulations have been published for 59 categories and apply to between 35,000 and 45,000 facilities that discharge directly to the nation&#x27;s waters,129,000 facilities that discharge to POTWs, and construction sites. These regulations are responsible for preventing the discharge of almost 700 billion pounds of pollutants each year. EPA has updated some categories since their initial promulgation and has added new categories.

The secondary treatment standards for POTWs and the effluent guidelines are implemented through NPDES permits. (See Title IV.) The categorical pretreatment standards are typically implemented by POTWs through permits that they issue to their industrial users.

==== Water Quality Standards Program ====
The CWA requires states to monitor their water bodies and establish Water Quality Standards for them. Water Quality Standards (WQS) are risk-based requirements which set site-specific allowable pollutant levels for individual water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, streams and wetlands. States set WQS by designating uses for the water body (e.g., recreation, water supply, aquatic life, agriculture) and applying water quality criteria (numeric pollutant concentrations and narrative requirements) to protect the designated uses. An antidegradation policy is also issued by each state to maintain and protect existing uses and high quality waters.

If a state fails to issue WQS, EPA is required to issue standards for that state.

Water bodies that do not meet applicable water quality standards with technology-based controls alone are placed on the section 303(d) list of water bodies not meeting standards. Water bodies on the 303(d) list require development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). A TMDL is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet WQS. The TMDL is determined after study of the specific properties of the water body and the pollutant sources that contribute to the non-compliant status. Generally, the TMDL determines load based on a Waste Load Allocation (WLA), Load Allocation (LA), and Margin of Safety (MOS) Once the TMDL assessment is completed and the maximum pollutant loading capacity defined, an implementation plan is developed that outlines the measures needed to reduce pollutant loading to the non-compliant water body, and bring it into compliance. Over 60,000 TMDLs are proposed or in development for U.S. waters in the next decade and a half.

Following the issuance of a TMDL for a water body, implementation of the requirements involves modification to NPDES permits for facilities discharging to the water body to meet the WLA allocated to the water body (see Title IV). The development of WQS and TMDL is a complex process, both scientifically and legally, and it is a resource-intensive process for state agencies.

More than half of U.S. stream and river miles continue to violate water quality standards. Surveys of lakes, ponds and reservoirs indicated that about 70 percent were impaired (measured on a surface area basis), and a little more than 70 percent of the nation&#x27;s coastlines, and 90 percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas were also impaired.

==== National Water Quality Inventory ====
The primary mode of informing the quality of water of rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, estuaries, coastal waters and wetlands of the U.S. is through the &quot;National Water Quality Inventory Report.&quot; Water quality assessments are conducted pursuant to water quality standards adopted by states and other jurisdictions (territories, interstate commissions and tribes). The report is conveyed to Congress as a means to inform Congress and the public of compliance with quality standards established by states, territories and tribes. The assessments identify water quality problems within the states and jurisdictions, list the impaired and threatened water bodies, and identify non-point sources that contribute to poor water quality. Every two years states must submit reports that describe water quality conditions to EPA with a complete inquiry of social and economic costs and benefits of achieving goals of the Act.

==== Enforcement ====
Under section 309, EPA can issue administrative orders against violators, and seek civil or criminal penalties when necessary:
*For a first offense of criminal negligence, the minimum fine is $2,500, with a maximum of $25,000 fine per day of violation. A violator may also receive up to a year in jail. On a second offense, a maximum fine of $50,000 per day may be issued.
*For a knowing endangerment violation, i.e. placing another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, a fine may be issued up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 15 years for an individual, or up to $1,000,000 for an organization.
States that are authorized by EPA to administer the NPDES program must have authority to enforce permit requirements under their respective state laws.

==== Federal facilities ====
Military bases, national parks and other federal facilities must comply with CWA provisions.

==== Thermal pollution ====
Section 316 requires standards for thermal pollution discharges, as well as standards for cooling water intake structures (e.g., fish screens). These standards are applicable to power plants and other industrial facilities.

==== Nonpoint Source Management Program ====
The 1987 amendments created the Nonpoint Source Management Program under CWA section 319. This program provides grants to states, territories and Indian tribes to support demonstration projects, technology transfer, education, training, technical assistance and related activities designed to reduce nonpoint source pollution. Grant funding for the program averaged $210 million annually for Fiscal Years 2004 through 2008.

==== Military vessels ====
Congress amended the CWA in 1996 to require development of Uniform National Discharge Standards (&quot;UNDS&quot;) for military vessels. EPA and the Department of Defense published standards in 2017 and 2020.

=== Title IV - Permits and licenses ===

====State certification of compliance====
States are required to certify that discharges authorized by federal permits will not violate the state&#x27;s water quality standards.

==== NPDES permits for point sources ====

The NPDES permits program is authorized by CWA section 402. The initial permits issued in the 1970s and early 1980s focused on POTWs and industrial wastewater—typically &quot;process&quot; wastewater and cooling water where applicable, and in some cases, industrial stormwater. The 1987 WQA expanded the program to cover stormwater discharges explicitly, both from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) and industrial sources. The MS4 NPDES permits require regulated municipalities to use Best Management Practices to reduce pollutants to the &quot;Maximum Extent Practicable.&quot; MS4s serve over 80% of the US population and provide drainage for 4% of the land area.

POTWs with combined sewers are required to comply with the national &quot;Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy,&quot; published by EPA in 1994. The policy requires municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate overflow-related pollution problems. About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40 million people.

Non-stormwater permits typically include numeric effluent limitations for specific pollutants. A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration allowed in the discharge, e.g., 30 mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand. Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes a violation of the permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements. Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment.

In 2012, EPA estimated that there are over 500,000 stormwater permittees. This number includes permanent facilities such as municipal (POTW, MS4) and industrial plants; and construction sites, which are temporary stormwater dischargers.

==== Dredge and fill permits ====
Section 404 requires that a discharger of dredged or fill material obtain a permit, unless the activity is eligible for an exemption. Essentially, all discharges affecting the bottom elevation of a jurisdictional water body require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). These permits are an essential part of protecting streams and wetlands, which are often filled by land developers. Wetlands are vital to the ecosystem in filtering streams and rivers and providing habitat for wildlife.

There are two main types of wetlands permits: general permits and individual permits. General permits change periodically and cover broad categories of activities, and require the permittee to comply with all stated conditions. General permits (such as the &quot;Nationwide Permits&quot;) are issued for fill activities that will result in minimal adverse effects to the environment. Individual permits are utilized for actions that are not addressed by a general permit, or that do not meet the conditions of a General Permit. In addition, individual permits typically require more analysis than do the general permits, and usually require much more time to prepare the application and to process the permit.

When the USACE processes an application for an Individual Permit, it must issue a public notice describing the proposed action described in the permit application. Although the Corps District Engineer makes the decision to grant a permit, the EPA Administrator may veto a permit if it is not reasonable. Before making such a decision, however, EPA must consult with the USACE. A USACE permit typically expires after five years.

Mountaintop removal mining requires a section 404 permit when soil and rock from the mining operation is placed in streams and wetlands (commonly called a &quot;valley fill&quot;). Pollutant discharges from valley fills to streams also requires an NPDES permit.

=====Exemptions=====
After passage of the CWA in 1972, a controversy arose as to the application of section 404 to agriculture and certain other activities. The Act was interpreted by some to place restrictions on virtually all placement of dredged materials in wetlands and other waters of the United States, raising concern that the federal government was about to place all agricultural activities under the jurisdiction of USACE. For opponents of the Act, section 404 had, as a result of this concern, become a symbol of dramatic over-regulation. When Congress considered the 1977 CWA Amendments, a significant issue was to ensure that certain agricultural activities and other selected activities, could continue without the government&#x27;s supervision—in other words, completely outside the regulatory or permit jurisdiction of any federal agency.

The 1977 amendments included a set of six section 404 exemptions. For example, totally new activities such as construction of farm roads, Sec. 1344(f)(1)(E), construction of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, and minor agricultural drainage, Sec. 1344(f)(1)(A), all are exempted by Statute. Section 1344(f)(1)(C), which exempts discharge of dredged material &quot;for the purpose of... the maintenance of drainage ditches.&quot; All of these exemptions were envisioned to be self-executing, that is not technically requiring an administrative no-jurisdiction determination. One such example was the maintenance of agricultural drainage ditches. Throughout the hearing process, Congressmen of every environmental persuasion repeatedly stated that the over $5 Billion invested in drainage facilities could be maintained without government regulation of any kind. Senator Edmund Muskie, for example, explained that exempt activities such as agricultural drainage would be entirely unregulated. Other exemptions were granted as well, including exemptions for normal farming activities.

=====Importance of no-jurisdiction determinations=====
Although Congress envisioned a set of self-executing exemptions, it has become common for landowners to seek no-jurisdiction determinations from the USACE. A landowner who intends to make substantial investments in acquisition or improvement of land might lawfully proceed with exempt activity, a permit not being required. The problem is that if the landowner&#x27;s assumptions were incorrect and the activity later determined not to be exempt, the USACE will issue a cease and desist order. Obtaining an advanced ruling provides some level of comfort that the activities will have been deemed conducted in good faith.

=====Recapture of exemptions=====
Because some of the six exemptions involved new activities, such as minor drainage and silviculture (the clearing of forests by the timber industry), Congress recognized the need to impose some limitations on exemptions. Consequently, Congress placed the so-called recapture clause limitation on these new project exemptions. Under section 404(f)(2), such new projects would be deprived of their exemption if all of the following three characteristics could be shown:
# A discharge of dredge or fill material in the navigable waters of the United States;
# The discharge is incidental to an activity having as its purpose the bringing of an area of navigable waters into a use to which it was not previously subject, and
# Where the flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the reach of such waters may be reduced.
To remove the exemption, all of these requirements must be fulfilled—the discharge, the project purpose of bringing an area into a use to which it was not previously subject, and the impairment or reduction of navigable waters.

==== POTW Biosolids Management Program ====
The 1987 WQA created a program for management of biosolids (sludge) generated by POTWs. The Act instructed EPA to develop guidelines for usage and disposal of sewage sludge or biosolids. The EPA regulations: (1) Identify uses for sewage sludge, including disposal; (2) Specify factors to be taken into account in determining the measures and practices applicable to each such use or disposal (including publication of information on costs); and (3) Identify concentrations of pollutants which interfere with each such use or disposal. EPA created an Intra-Agency Sludge Task Force to aid in developing comprehensive sludge regulations that are designed to do the following: (1) Conduct a multimedia examination of sewage sludge management, focusing on sewage sludge generated by POTWs; and (2) develop a cohesive Agency policy on sewage sludge management, designed to guide the Agency in implementing sewage sludge regulatory and management programs.

The term &quot;biosolids&quot; is used to differentiate treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 &quot;Beneficial Reuse Policy&quot; and the 1991 &quot;Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge,&quot; with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.

The quality of sewage sludge is controlled under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, management practice, and operational standards or combination of these. Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants and those that do not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up influent, improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of disposal method. EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect public health and the environment, but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities. Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it.

Standards are set for sewage sludge generated or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs are referred to as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. If pretreatment does not sufficiently reduce pollutant levels, communities have to dispose rather than use sludge.

=== Title V - General Provisions ===
==== Citizen suits ====
Any U.S. citizen may file a citizen suit against any person who has allegedly violated an effluent standard or limitation (i.e., a provision in an NPDES permit) or against the EPA Administrator if the Administrator failed to perform any non-discretionary act or duty required by the CWA. Citizens may commence citizen suits after giving a 60-day prior notice of the alleged violations to the alleged violator.

==== Employee protection ====
The CWA includes an employee (&quot;whistleblower&quot;) protection provision. Employees in the U.S. who believe they were fired or suffered adverse action related to enforcement of the CWA may file a written complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

=== Title VI - State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds ===
The Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program was authorized by the 1987 WQA. This replaced the municipal construction grants program, which was authorized in the 1972 law under Title II. In the CWSRF, federal funds are provided to the states and Puerto Rico to capitalize their respective revolving funds, which are used to provide financial assistance (loans or grants) to local governments for wastewater treatment, nonpoint source pollution control and estuary protection.

The fund provides loans to municipalities at lower-than-market rates. The program&#x27;s average interest rate was 1.4 percent nationwide in 2017, compared to an average market rate of 3.5 percent. In 2017, CWSRF assistance totaling $7.4 billion was provided to 1,484 local projects across the country.

== Recent developments ==
=== Waters of the United States ===

In May 2015 USACE and EPA published a new rule on the definition of &quot;waters of the United States&quot; (&quot;WOTUS&quot;) and the future enforcement of the act. Thirteen states sued, and on August 27 U.S. Chief District Judge for North Dakota Ralph R. Erickson issued a preliminary injunction blocking the regulation in those states. In a separate lawsuit, on October 9 a divided Sixth Circuit appeals court stayed the rule&#x27;s application nationwide. Congress then passed a joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act overturning the WOTUS rule, but President Barack Obama vetoed the measure.

On February 28, 2017, President Donald Trump signed documents directing EPA and USACE to review and rewrite the Obama administration&#x27;s &quot;Clean Water Rule,&quot; which would clarify the WOTUS definition. The agencies were ordered to reassess the rule consistent with promoting economic growth and minimizing regulatory uncertainty.

The Sixth Circuit appeals court stay was overturned on January 22, 2018, when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that challenges to the 2015 rule must be filed in United States district courts. EPA then formally suspended the 2015 regulation and announced plans to issue a new version later in 2018. The Trump administration formally repealed the WOTUS rule on October 22, 2019 and published a replacement rule on April 21, 2020. On August 30, 2021, the United States District Court for the District of Arizona threw out the 2020 replacement rule.

Under the administration of President Joe Biden, USACE and EPA published a revised definition of WOTUS on January 18, 2023, restoring the pre-2015 regulations on the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterways, effective March 20, 2023. However, on May 25, 2023, the restored WOTUS regulation would again be eliminated after the Supreme Court ruled in the second &quot;Sackett v. Environmental Protection&quot; Agency case that the Clean Water Act&#x27;s regulatory authority of waters in the United States was limited to wetlands and waters &quot;with a continuous surface connection&quot; to larger bodies of water, returning to Justice Scalia&#x27;s definition as outlined in his &quot;Rapanos v. United States&quot; opinion. Under this decision, the EPA is no longer permitted to regulate water which has been isolated from these larger bodies of water. Some estimates suggest this decision removed EPA control from as much as half of its previously-regulated waters.

== Earlier legislation ==
During the 1880s and 1890s, Congress directed USACE to prevent dumping and filling in the nation&#x27;s harbors, and the program was vigorously enforced. Congress first addressed water pollution issues in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, giving the Corps the authority to regulate most kinds of obstructions to navigation, including hazards resulting from effluents. Portions of this law remain in effect, including Section 13, the so-called Refuse Act. In 1910, USACE used the act to object to a proposed sewer in New York City, but a court ruled that pollution control was a matter left to the states alone. Speaking to the 1911 National Rivers and Harbors Congress, the chief of the Corps, William H. Bixby, suggested that modern treatment facilities and prohibitions on dumping &quot;should either be made compulsory or at least encouraged everywhere in the United States.&quot; Most legal analysts have concluded that the 1899 law did not address environmental impacts from pollution, such as sewage or industrial discharges. However, there were several pollution enforcement cases in the 1960s and 1970s where the law was cited for broader pollution control objectives.

Some sections of the 1899 act have been superseded by various amendments, including the 1972 CWA, while other notable legislative predecessors include:
* &quot;Public Health Service Act of 1912&quot; expanded the mission of the United States Public Health Service to study problems of sanitation, sewage and pollution.
* &quot;Oil Pollution Act of 1924&quot; prohibited the intentional discharge of fuel oil into tidal waters and provided authorization for USACE to apprehend violators. This was repealed by the 1972 CWA, reducing the Corps&#x27; role in pollution control to the discharge of dredged or fill material.
* &quot;Federal Water Pollution Control Act&quot; of 1948 created a comprehensive set of water quality programs that also provided some financing for state and local governments. Enforcement was limited to interstate waters. The Public Health Service provided financial and technical assistance.
* &quot;Water Quality Act of 1965&quot; required states to issue water quality standards for interstate waters, and authorized the newly created Federal Water Pollution Control Administration to set standards where states failed to do so.

When EPA first opened its doors in 1970, the agency had weak authority to protect U.S. waters, lacking the legal power to write effluent guidelines and possessing only general authority to require secondary treatment from industrial dischargers.

The 1969 burning Cuyahoga River had sparked national outrage; the Act grew out of it. In December 1970 a federal grand jury investigation led by U.S. Attorney Robert Jones (Ohio lawyer) began, of water pollution allegedly being caused by about 12 companies in northeastern Ohio. It was the first grand jury investigation of water pollution in the area. The Attorney General of the United States, John N. Mitchell, gave a Press Conference December 18, 1970 referencing new pollution control litigation, with particular reference to work with the new Environmental Protection Agency, and announcing the filing of a lawsuit that morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland. It was largely based on these and other litigation experiences that criteria for new legislation were identified.

== Case law ==
*&quot;United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.&quot; 474 U.S. 121 (1985). The Supreme Court upheld the Act&#x27;s coverage in regulating wetlands that intermingle with navigable waters. This ruling was revised by the 2006 &quot;Rapanos&quot; decision.
*&quot;Edward Hanousek, Jr v. United States&quot; (9th Cir. Court of Appeals, 1996; certiorari denied, 2000). In 1994, during rock removal operations, a backhoe operator accidentally struck a petroleum pipeline near the railroad tracks. The operator&#x27;s mistake caused the pipeline to rupture and spill between 1,000 and 5,000 gallons of heating oil into the Skagway river. Despite not being present at the scene during operations White Pass and Yukon Route Roadmaster Edward Hanousek, Jr. and President Paul Taylor were both held responsible for the spill and convicted.
*&quot;Solid Waste Agency of North Cook County (SWANCC) v. United States Army Corps of Engineers&quot; 531 U.S. 159 (2001), possibly denying the CWA&#x27;s hold in isolated intrastate waters and certainly denying the validity of the 1986 &quot;Migratory Bird Rule.&quot;
*&quot;S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Env. Protection&quot; 547 U.S. 370 (2006). The Court ruled that section 401 state certification requirements apply to hydroelectric dams, which are federally licensed, where the dams cause a discharge into navigable waters.
*&quot;Rapanos v. United States&quot; 547 U.S. 715 (2006). The Supreme Court questioned federal jurisdiction as it attempted to define the Act&#x27;s use of the terms &quot;navigable waters&quot; and &quot;waters of the United States.&quot; The Court rejected the position of the USACE that its authority over water was essentially limitless. Though the case resulted in no binding case law, the Court suggested a narrowing of federal jurisdiction and implied the federal government needed a more substantial link between navigable federal waters and wetlands than it had been using, but held onto the &quot;significant nexus&quot; test.
*&quot;Northwest Environmental Advocates et al. v. EPA&quot; (9th Cir. Court of Appeals, 2008). Vessel discharges are subject to NPDES permit requirements. &quot;See&quot; Ballast water regulation in the United States.
*&quot;National Cotton Council v. EPA&quot; (6th Cir. Court of Appeals, 2009). Point source discharges of biological pesticides, and chemical pesticides that leave a residue, into waters of the U.S. are subject to NPDES permit requirements.
*&quot;Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co.&quot; 578 U.S. __ (2016), 8-0 ruling that a jurisdictional determination by the Army Corps of Engineers that land contains &quot;waters of the United States&quot; is a &quot;final agency action&quot;, which is reviewable by the courts. This allows landowners to sue in court if the Army Corps of Engineers determines that the land contains waters of the United States (and therefore falls under the Clean Water Act).
*&quot;County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund&quot; 590 U.S. __ (2020), a 6–3 ruling that a NPDES permit is required for point sources (as established in the statute) or for non-point sources that are &quot;functionally equivalent&quot; to direct discharge, such as in the specific case, wastewater discharged into injection wells that eventually reach the ocean, a navigable waterway.
*&quot;Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency&quot; 598 U.S. __ (2023), a 5-4 ruling that only those waters with a &quot;continuous surface connection&quot; to traditionally-defined navigable waters are protected under the CWA, striking down the &quot;significant nexus&quot; test which had been in use since the 2006 &quot;Rapanos&quot; case and removing CWA protection from as much as half of the nation&#x27;s waterways.

== Effects ==

To date, the water quality goals stated by Congress in the 1972 act have not been achieved by American society:
* &quot;to make all U.S. waters fishable and swimmable by 1983;&quot;
* &quot;to have zero water pollution discharge by 1985;&quot;
* &quot;to prohibit discharge of toxic amounts of toxic pollutants&quot;.
More than half of U.S. stream and river miles, about 70 percent of lakes, ponds and reservoirs, and 90 percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas continue to violate water quality standards. The reasons for the impairment vary by location; major sources are agriculture, industry and communities (typically through urban runoff). Some of these pollution sources are difficult to control through national regulatory programs.

However, since the passage of the 1972 act, the levels of pollution in the United States have experienced a dramatic decrease. The law has resulted in much cleaner waterways than before the bill was passed. Agriculture, industry, communities and other sources continue to discharge waste into surface waters nationwide, and many of these waters are drinking water sources. In many watersheds nutrient pollution (excess nitrogen and phosphorus) has become a major problem. It is argued in a 2008 paper that the Clean Water Act has made extremely positive contributions to the environment, but is in desperate need of reform to address the pollution problems that remain. A 2015 paper acknowledges that the CWA has been effective in controlling point sources, but that it has not been effective with nonpoint sources, and argues that the law must be updated to address the nation&#x27;s current water quality problems.

A 2017 working paper finds that &quot;most types of water pollution declined over the period 1962-2001, though the rate of decrease slowed over time... Our finding of decreases in most pollutants implies that the prevalence of such violations was even greater before the Clean Water Act.&quot; Several studies have estimated that the costs of the CWA (including the expenditures for the Title II construction grants program) are higher than the benefits. An EPA study had similar findings, but acknowledged that several kinds of benefits were unmeasured. A 2018 study argues that &quot;available estimates of the costs and benefits of water pollution control programs [including the CWA] are incomplete and do not conclusively determine the net benefits of surface water quality.&quot;

== Criticism ==
According to a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Clean Water Act has been one of the most controversial regulations in the history of the United States. The paper suggests that it remains uncertain whether the Clean Water Act has been efficacious, or if there has been any discernible reduction in water pollution. An analysis conducted in the 1990s provided a summary of these uncertainties, “As we approached the twenty-year anniversary of [The Clean Water Act], no comprehensive analysis was available to answer basic questions: How much cleaner are our rivers than they were two decades ago?”

Council of Economic Advisers chair Paul McCracken described the Clean Water Act as an “...inefficient use of national resources that would not produce balancing [of] social and economic benefits”.

According to the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), a public interest law firm, the Clean Water Act&#x27;s (CWA) definition of &quot;navigable waters&quot; is excessively broad and ambiguous leading to concerns about regulatory overreach and potential abuse of authority.

=== Legal challenges to CWA ===
In &quot;Sackett v. EPA&quot;, Chantell and Mike Sackett sought to build a home on their Idaho property in 2007 but were stopped by the EPA, which claimed the land was federally regulated wetlands under the CWA. The Sacketts faced severe fines unless they obtained a federal permit, leading to a 16-year legal battle. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in their favor, limiting the EPA’s authority.

In &quot;Robertson v. United States&quot;, Joe Robertson, a U.S. Navy veteran was prosecuted and convicted under the CWA for digging ponds on his private property in Montana to prevent devastating fires. This case highlighted the CWA’s lack of clear definition of “navigable waters” and the resulting abuse of regulatory power.

Furthermore, in 2019, the Supreme Court agreed to review a Ninth Circuit decision regarding the Clean Water Act’s regulation of pollution that reaches surface water through groundwater.

<text>Middle Binyang Cave () is cave number 140 at the Longmen Grottoes near Luoyang, Henan, China.

==Dimensions==
12m long, 10.9m wide, 9.3m high.

==History==
Constructed by order of Emperor Xuanwu of the Northern Wei in honour of his parents Emperor Xiaowen and Empress Wenzhao, the cave was supposed to imitate Lingyansi Cave at the Yungang Caves. Work began in 500 and was completed in 523. In 1987 a brick-entrance was demolished to reveal two new figures: a four-headed, four-armed Brahma and a one headed, four armed Śakra devendra.

==Features==
The back wall is a carved Sakyamuni, with two disciples and two bodhisattvas. The main Buddha and bodhisattvas are representative of the Northern Wei sculptural style. A lotus-flower pool decorates the floor. The ceiling is engraved with a blossoming lotus flower, 8 musical apsarases, 2 attending apsarases and tassel and drapery patterns. The front wall is covered with a large Vimalakirti relief, the Prince Sattva jataka, the Prince Sudatta jataka, an emperor/empress worshipping scene and ten deity kings.

==Nearby caves==
The cave is flanked by North and South Binyang Caves.

<doc id="647667" wikidata="Q1587395" url="?curid=647667" title="Kashmir flycatcher">
<text>The Kashmir flycatcher (Ficedula subrubra) is a small passerine bird in the flycatcher family Muscicapidae. It breeds in the Northwest Himalayas and winters in southern India and Sri Lanka. It was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the red-breasted flycatcher, &quot;Ficedula parva&quot;, which is its closest living relative. Males are distinctive in having a blackish border to the reddish throat while the females can easily be confused with those of &quot;F. parva&quot;.

== Description ==
The Kashmir flycatcher is 13 cm long, an insectivorous species closely related to the red-breasted flycatcher and sharing the habits of flicking its tail up while perching. The male has a grey-brown back with an orange-red throat, breast and flanks, bordered with black on the throat and breast. Females and first-winter birds have slightly browner upperparts, and the red of the underparts may be reduced to just a pinkish wash. The females have the tail darker than the back with white on the lower basal half of the outer feathers. The male of the similar taiga flycatcher, &quot;Ficedula albicilla&quot;, has the reddish-orange area limited to the throat and the top of the breast, and lacks the black border.

It breeds in the north-west Himalayas in the Kashmir region of the Indian Subcontinent. It is migratory and winters in the hills of central Sri Lanka, the Nilgiris, and the Western Ghats of India.

The Kashmir flycatcher breeds in forests at 1800–2400 m in the Himalayas, often in mixed broad leaved forest with &quot;Perrottetia&quot; and &quot;Corylus&quot;. It nests in May and June in a hole in a tree under a metre above the ground. The nest is lined with moss, bark and hair. The eggs, 3-5 of which are laid are pale green and speckled in reddish brown, more densely at the broad end. They are incubated by the female.

Most individuals leave the breeding grounds in September, arriving in Sri Lanka in October and departing again in late March. One of the best places to see this rare species is Victoria Park in Nuwara Eliya.

The song is a short melodic &quot;sweet-eet sweet-eet-did-he&quot;, and the calls include a sharp &quot;chak&quot; and a harsh rattling &quot;trrr&quot; accompanied by wing flicking and tail movement.

This is a vulnerable species with a decreasing population and breeding range, which is also severely fragmented as a result of the destruction of temperate mixed deciduous forests by commercial timber extraction, agriculture and livestock grazing. The population is thought to be between 2,500 and 10,000 birds.

<text>The Yungang Grottoes (), formerly the Wuzhoushan Grottoes (), are ancient Chinese Buddhist temple grottoes built during the Northern Wei dynasty near the city of Datong, then called Pingcheng, in the province of Shanxi. They are excellent examples of rock-cut architecture and one of the three most famous ancient Buddhist sculptural sites of China. The others are Longmen and Mogao.

The site is located about 16 km west of the city of Datong, in the valley of the Shi Li river at the base of the Wuzhou Shan mountains. They are an outstanding example of the Chinese stone carvings from the 5th and 6th centuries. There are 53 major caves, along with 51,000 niches housing the same number of Buddha statues. Additionally, there are around 1,100 minor caves. A Ming dynasty-era fort is still located on top of the cliff housing the Yungang Grottoes.

The grottoes were excavated in the south face of a sandstone cliff about 2,600 feet long and 30 to 60 feet high. In 2001, the Yungang Grottoes were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Yungang Grottoes are considered by UNESCO to be a &quot;masterpiece of early Chinese Buddhist cave art... [and] ...represent the successful fusion of Buddhist religious symbolic art from south and central Asia with Chinese cultural traditions, starting in the 5th century CE under Imperial auspices.&quot; It is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration.

==History==

After the decline of the Western Jin dynasty, the northern parts of China came under the control of the Tuoba-ruled Northern Wei. They made the city of Pingcheng (), now known as Datong (), their capital. Due to its promotion, Pingcheng saw an increase in construction work. The Northern Wei early adopted Buddhism as their state religion. Buddhism arrived in this location via travel on the ancient North Silk Road, the northernmost route of about 2600 kilometres in length, which connected the ancient Chinese capital of Xi&#x27;an to the west over the Wushao Ling Pass to Wuwei and emerging in Kashgar before linking to ancient Parthia.

The work on this first period of carving lasted until the year 465 AD, and these caves are now known as caves 16–20. Beginning around the year 471 AD, in a second construction phase that lasted until 494 AD, the twin caves 5/6, 7/8, and 9/10 as well as the caves 11, 12, and probably 13 were constructed under the supervision and support of the imperial court. The imperial patronage ended 494 AD with the move of the Wei court to the new capital of Luoyang. All other caves emerged under private patronage in a third construction period, lasting until 525, when the construction came to a final halt due to uprisings in the area.

=== Deterioration and Conservation ===
Since the end of the works, the sandstone of the grottoes has been exposed to heavy weathering. Many of the grottoes are exposed to the open air, and are therefore vulnerable to various forms of pollution and deterioration.  Windblown dust and air pollution from the industrial city of Datong, as well as dust from mines and highways near the site pose a threat to the preservation of the ancient statues.  The site is also in proximity of the Gobi Desert, the storms of which can contribute to the decay of the statues. The ensuing centuries therefore saw several attempts to preserve the caves and to repair sustained damage. During the Liao dynasty the caves saw some renewing of statues and, from 1049 to 1060, the buildup of the &quot;10 temples of Yungang&quot;, which were meant to protect the main caves. However, they were destroyed again some 60 years later in a fire. The wooden buildings extant in front of caves 5 and 6 were constructed in 1621, during the early Qing dynasty. Since the 1950s, cracks in the sandstone have been sealed by grouting, and forestation has been implemented in an effort to reduce the weathering due to sandstorms. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards damaged many of the carvings, and bullet marks are still visible to observers. During April and May 1991, Caltech personnel conducted air pollutant measurement experiments in the Yungang Grottoes. It was found that nearly all of the airborne matter was mineral dust or carbon particles, allowing a focus of attention on sources of these kinds of matter.

== Cave 6 ==
Cave 6 is one of the richest of the Yungang sites.  It was constructed between 465 and 494 C.E. by Emperor Xiao Wen.  The cave&#x27;s surface area is approximately 1,000 square meters.  The entire interior of the cave is carved and painted.  There is a stupa pillar in the center of the room extending from the floor to the ceiling.  The walls are divided into two stories.  The walls of the upper stories are host to carvings of standing Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and monks among other celestial figures.  All of the carvings were painted, but because the caves have been repainted evidently up to twelve times, determining the original scheme is difficult.

==Gallery==
==In Popular Culture==
The site was heavily featured, as was the rest of Shanxi province, in the settings visited by the character The Destined One from the globally renowned AAA game Black Myth: Wukong. Tourism greatly increased as the grotto went from the least visited of the major three grottoes from the Northern Wei to its most visited within a few weeks of the game’s launch. Shanxi has promoted it, in comparison with the game visuals very heavily, as seen in its 2024 tourism council advertisements to great results.

<text>Delta 4 was a British software developer founded by Fergus McNeill, writing and publishing interactive fiction.

Delta 4 designed games between 1984 and 1992. Some were self-published, others were released by CRL Group, Piranha Software, Silversoft, or On-Line Entertainment. Delta 4 were also credited with providing the code for Jonathan Nash&#x27;s tape magazine &quot;YS2&quot; which was given away free with &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; magazine and published by Future Publishing.

== History ==
Delta 4 was formed by McNeill with a few friends whilst still at school. Their debut text adventure games were the &quot;Dragonstar&quot; trilogy (&quot;...like &quot;Classic Adventure&quot; but without the interesting bits&quot;) and two &quot;Holy Joystick&quot; comedy adventures, self-published in 1984. Gilsoft&#x27;s &quot;The Quill&quot; was the design software.

Their first critical success was &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;, inspired by the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; novel of the same name. Published in 1985, it received a &quot;Sinclair User&quot; Classic award. They also published &quot;Robin of Sherlock&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Delta 4 developed several CD-based games. &quot;The Town with No Name&quot;, &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; and &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; were all developed using D.U.N.E. (Developers Universal Non-programming Environment), and all games were panned by both critics and players.

=== &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; ===


&quot;Psycho Killer&quot; is a graphic action-adventure game released by On-Line Entertainment in 1992 for the Commodore CDTV. A version for MS-DOS was released in 1993.

The game involves the protagonist (unnamed in game but listed in credits as &quot;John Schulz&quot;) going on a quest in order to save a woman (listed as &quot;Sarah Collins&quot;) from a murderer (&quot;Morgan James&quot;), and to save himself. The graphics for the game were created using digitised still photographs that were taken in the suburbs of London.

Gameplay of &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; is restricted to a point-and-click interface, such as clicking certain arrows to go their respective direction. There are multiple times in the game where the player must respond promptly to a quick time event in order to proceed to the next scene. Failure to do so can result in the game ending with the protagonist&#x27;s death.
In issue 32 of &quot;Amiga Format&quot;, the reviewer gave the game 13% and complained of &quot;poor gameplay&quot;, comparing it to an &quot;interactive home movie&quot; and asked who would want to play a game featuring a &quot;spotty herbert who drives a Vauxhall Chevette&quot;. The game was reviewed again in issue 39 of the same magazine; the review gave it the same score, and complained again about the poor gameplay.

&quot;Amiga Joker&quot; reviewed the game more positively. The magazine gave the game a 3/5, stating, &quot;with a little bit of goodwill, the game could be described as a interactive movie&quot;. The magazine ended the review calling the game &quot;the best pure CD game ever.&quot;

&quot;Amiga Magazine&quot; also reviewed the game positively, but did not give a score. The magazine spoke about the &quot;forgiving reaction time&quot;. The magazine also said that the game is well-tuned to the CDTV. The magazine complained that the mouse pointer was black which made it &quot;impossible to see&quot; during some scenes.

<doc id="647682" wikidata="Q7244239" url="?curid=647682" title="Prince Sattva">
<text>Prince Sattva was one of the previous incarnations of Gautama Buddha, according to a jataka story.
==Ascetic life==
The son of King Maharatha, he became an ascetic and gained a few disciples.

==Dilemma==
On his walk with his closest disciple, he comes to the edge of a cliff, at the bottom of which is a starving tigress about to eat her newborn cubs in desperation. The bodhisattva tells his disciple to go look for food and he will stay and try to figure out a way to save her and her young. While his disciple is gone, the bodhisattva reflects that while his disciple very well may not find food, his body is just so much flesh as the tradition states, and by giving it up, he can save the tigress&#x27; purity and her cubs&#x27; lives. He leaps off the cliff to his death, attracting the tigress&#x27; attention with his impact, and she eats his body. 

==Achievement and legacy==
In this way, he comes closer to perfecting some of the ten Buddhist perfections: those of generosity, renunciation, morality, resolution and equanimity. His disciple returns, having not found food, and upon discovering what the bodhisattva has done, rejoices in his good deed. He comes back with other disciples and they and the heavens shower the spot with lotus flowers.

==Stupa==

The Chinese pilgrim Faxian reported one of the four great stupas of northern India that commemorates this incarnation&#x27;s &quot;dehadana&quot;. This dehadana is known as &quot;gift of the body&quot; in Indian Buddhist narrative literature.

<doc id="647683" wikidata="Q648655" url="?curid=647683" title="Lenin (1957 icebreaker)">
<text>Lenin () is a Soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker, the first nuclear-powered icebreaker in the world. Launched in 1957, it is both the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered surface ship and the first nuclear-powered civilian vessel. &quot;Lenin&quot; entered operation in 1959 and worked clearing sea routes for cargo ships along Russia&#x27;s northern coast. From 1960 to 1965 the ship covered over during the Arctic navigation season, of which almost was through ice. Nuclear power proved to be an ideal technology for a vessel working in such a remote area as it removed the need for regular replenishment of fuel. On 10 April 1974 the vessel was awarded the Order of Lenin. It was officially decommissioned in 1989. It was subsequently converted to a museum ship and is now permanently based at Murmansk.

==Propulsion==

When launched in 1957, &quot;Lenin&quot; was powered by three OK-150 reactors. In its late-1960s configuration, at full capacity the ship used 2.5 to 3 kg (five to six pounds) of uranium-235 per 100 days.

In the configuration employed from 1970, two OK-900 reactors provided steam for four steam turbines, that were in turn connected to generators, which powered three sets of electric motors to drive the ship&#x27;s three propellers.

==Nuclear accidents==
In February 1965, there was a loss-of-coolant accident. After being shut down for refueling, the coolant was removed from the number two reactor before the spent fuel had been removed. As a result, some of the fuel elements melted and deformed inside the reactor. When the spent elements were being unloaded for storage and disposal, it was found that 124 fuel assemblies (about 60% of the total) were stuck in the reactor core. It was decided to remove the fuel, control grid, and control rods as a unit for disposal; they were placed in a special cask, solidified, stored for two years, and dumped in Tsivolki Bay (near the Novaya Zemlya archipelago) in 1967.

The second accident was a cooling system leak which occurred in 1967, shortly after refueling. Finding the leak required breaking through the concrete and metal biological shield with sledgehammers. Once the leak was found, it became apparent that the sledgehammer damage could not be repaired; subsequently, all three reactors were removed by blowing them off the ship with shaped charges above a burial site off Novaya Zemlya, and replaced by two OK-900 reactors. This was completed in early 1970.
==Retirement==
&quot;Lenin&quot; was decommissioned in 1989, because its hull had worn thin from ice friction. She was laid up at Atomflot, a base for nuclear icebreakers in Murmansk, and repair and conversion into a museum ship was completed in 2005.

<text>Thomas Slade Gorton III (January 8, 1928 – August 19, 2020) was an American lawyer and politician from Washington. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a member of the United States Senate from 1981 to 1987, and again from 1989 to 2001. He held both of the state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats in his career and was narrowly defeated for reelection twice, first in 1986 by Brock Adams and again in 2000 by Maria Cantwell following a recount, becoming the last Republican senator to date for each seat.

==Early life and education==
Gorton was born in Chicago, on January 8, 1928, and raised in the suburb of Evanston, Illinois, the son of Ruth (Israel) and Thomas Slade Gorton, Jr., descendant of one of the founders of the companies that would become Gorton&#x27;s of Gloucester, and himself the founder that year of Slade Gorton &amp; Co., another fish supplier. His younger brother is Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He attended and graduated from Dartmouth College and subsequently from Columbia Law School. Gorton served in the United States Army from 1945 to 1946 and the United States Air Force from 1953 until 1956. He continued to serve in the Air Force Reserve Command until 1980 when he retired as a colonel.

== Early career ==
Gorton practiced law and entered politics in 1958, being elected to the Washington House of Representatives, in which he served from 1959 until 1969, becoming one of its highest-ranking members. He then served as Attorney General of Washington from 1969 until he entered the United States Senate in 1981. During his three terms as attorney general, Gorton was recognized for taking the unusual step of appearing personally to argue the state&#x27;s positions before the Supreme Court of the United States, and for prevailing in those efforts.

In 1970, Attorney General Gorton sued Major League Baseball for a violation of anti-trust laws after the loss of the Seattle Pilots, who were moved to Milwaukee after the league declined a bid from local ownership group. He hired trial lawyer William Lee Dwyer to oversee the case and eventually withdrew following the league&#x27;s approval of a second expansion team—the Seattle Mariners, who began play in 1977.

Years later, he approached Nintendo President Minoru Arakawa and Chairman Howard Lincoln in his search to find a buyer for the Mariners. Arakawa&#x27;s father-in-law, Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi, agreed to buy a majority stake in the team, preventing a potential move to Tampa. Gorton later helped broker a deal between King County officials and Mariners ownership on what is now called T-Mobile Park.

==U.S. Senate campaigns==
===1980===

In 1980, Gorton defeated longtime incumbent U.S. Senator and state legend Warren Magnuson by a 54% to 46% margin.

===1986===

Gorton was narrowly defeated by former U.S. Representative and United States Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams.

===1988===

Gorton ran for the state&#x27;s other Senate seat, which was being vacated by political ally Daniel J. Evans, in 1988 and won, defeating liberal Congressman Mike Lowry by a narrow margin.

In the Senate, Gorton had a moderate-to-conservative voting record, and was derided for what some perceived as strong hostility towards Native tribes. His reelection strategy centered on running up high vote totals in areas outside of left-leaning King County (home to Seattle).

===1994===

In 1994, Gorton repeated the process, defeating then-King County Councilman Ron Sims by 56% to 44%. He was an influential member of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services as he was the only member of the committee during his tenure to have reached a senior command rank in the uniformed services (USAF).

Gorton campaigned in Oregon for Gordon H. Smith and his successful 1996 Senate run.

In 1999, Gorton was among ten Republican senators who voted against the charge of perjury during the Impeachment of Bill Clinton, although he voted for Clinton&#x27;s conviction on the charge of obstruction of justice.

===2000===

In 2000, Democrat Maria Cantwell turned his &quot;it&#x27;s time for a change&quot; strategy against him and won by 2,229 votes out of nearly 2.5 million cast.

Furthermore, Washington&#x27;s Native tribes strongly opposed Gorton in 2000 because he consistently tried to weaken Native sovereignty while in the Senate.

Twice during his tenure in the Senate, Gorton sat at the Candy Desk.

==Later career==
In 2002, Gorton became a member of the 9/11 Commission, which issued its final report, the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, in 2004.

In 2005, Gorton became the chairman of the center-right Constitutional Law PAC, a political action committee formed to help elect candidates to the Washington State Supreme Court and Court of Appeals.

Gorton was an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. Gorton also served as a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

Gorton served on the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, which is a museum dedicated to the Constitution of the United States.

Gorton represented Seattle in a lawsuit against Clay Bennett to prevent the Seattle SuperSonics relocation basketball franchise, in accordance to a contract that would keep the team in Climate Pledge Arena until 2010. The city settled with Bennett, allowing him to move the team to Oklahoma City for $45 million with the possibility for another $30 million.

In 2010, the National Bureau of Asian Research founded the Slade Gorton International Policy Center. The Gorton Center is a policy research center, with three focus areas: policy research, fellowship and internship programs, and the Gorton History Program (archives). In 2013 the Gorton Center was the secretariat for the ‘Commission on The Theft of American Intellectual Property’, in which Gorton was a commissioner. Gorton was also a counselor at the National Bureau of Asian Research.

In 2012, Gorton was appointed to the board of directors of Clearwire, a wireless data services provider.

Gorton was a member of the board of the Discovery Institute, notable for its advocacy of the pseudoscience of intelligent design.

Gorton was also of counsel at K&amp;L Gates LLP.

Gorton opposed the candidacy of Donald Trump for President of the United States in 2016, instead writing in Independent candidate Evan McMullin. He later supported the First impeachment of Donald Trump and urged other Republicans to join him.

==Personal life and death==
He married the former Sally Jean Clark on June 28, 1958. They had three children, Sarah Nortz, Thomas Gorton, and Rebecca Dannaker. Sally Gorton died on July 20, 2013, one day before her 81st birthday.

Gorton died after a brief illness with complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on August 19, 2020 at the home of his daughter, Sarah Nortz in Clyde Hill, Washington, age 92.
