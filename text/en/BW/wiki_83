<text>Toonami ( ) is an American late-night television programming block that broadcasts Japanese anime and American action animation. It was created by Sean Akins and Jason DeMarco and currently produced by Williams Street, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Television Studios. The block is owned by The Cartoon Network, Inc., a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. The name is a portmanteau of the words &quot;cartoon&quot; and &quot;tsunami&quot;. It currently airs every Saturday night from 12:00 a.m. to 3:30 a.m. ET/PT

Toonami initially premiered as a weekday afternoon block on Cartoon Network in 1997. It ran in this format until 2004, when it transitioned to a Saturday evening schedule. The block aired until its initial conclusion in 2008. During its original run (1997–2008),Toonami primarily targeted older children and adolescents aged 7–18. It became known for showcasing action-oriented programming, particularly Japanese anime, which gained widespread popularity with American audiences. The block was distinguished by its space-themed aesthetic, anime music videos, drum-and-bass-influenced soundtrack, and its robot host, T.O.M. (short for Toonami Operations Module).

On May 26, 2012, Toonami was relaunched as a late night block on Adult Swim. This iteration is rebranding Adult Swim&#x27;s Saturday night action block (originally inherited from Toonami&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Run&quot; block), which primarily features anime deemed too mature for daytime programming.

On May 31, 2024, a new Friday afternoon block called Toonami Rewind debuted. It aired from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET/PT and showcased classic anime series. Toonami Rewind complemented Checkered Past, a Monday-through-Thursday block featuring older Cartoon Network series. However, on December 19, 2024, it was announced that Toonami Rewind would conclude on December 27, 2024.

== Broadcast history ==
=== Cartoon Network (1997–2008) ===
==== 1997–99: Moltar era ====
Toonami was Cartoon Network&#x27;s primary action-animation block. The block premiered on March 17, 1997, with &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, &quot;Cartoon Roulette&quot;, &quot;Voltron&quot;, another episode of &quot;Roulette&quot;, and &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; respectively as its first programs. It first took the place of Power Zone, the Super Adventures block&#x27;s most recent iteration on Cartoon Network, which had been a mainstay of the network since its introduction on October 1, 1992. Toonami was originally a spin off of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; (since first host Moltar was a character on &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;) and aired weekday afternoons. The block was originally hosted by &quot;Space Ghost&quot; villain-turned-producer Moltar (voiced by C. Martin Croker) at the Ghost Planet Industries building from March 17, 1997, to July 9, 1999.

==== 1999–2000: T.O.M. 1 era ====
On July 12, 1999, Cartoon Network retired previous host Moltar and relaunched Toonami with a new environment, the Ghost Planet Spaceship &quot;Absolution&quot;, and a new host, a robot named T.O.M. (voiced by Sonny Strait), which introduced viewers to him with this speech:
Soon afterwards, the first program of the T.O.M. era, the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; episode &quot;The Cosmetics Caper&quot;, premiered. It introduced &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; on Toonami, becoming the first Cartoon Network original series on the block. Also introduced that day was the Midnight Run, a late night block. It was originally a five-hour Saturday night block (technically Sunday) at midnight EST until March 2000, when it moved to weeknights in an hour-long format until January 2003. It consisted of anime such as &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, &quot;Voltron&quot;, &quot;Robotech&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;, &quot;The Big O&quot;, and &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;. Midnight Run tended to have more blood and violence than its daytime counterpart, even running an uncut version of &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; between March and November 2000. One special edition that started on Friday, August 31, 2001, featured music videos such as &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; by Gorillaz, and songs by Daft Punk from their 2001 album &quot;Discovery&quot;, the music videos of which constitute the 2003 Japanese-French musical &quot;Interstella 5555&quot;, and Kenna&#x27;s &quot;Hellbent&quot;. Another event was &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; taking over the Midnight Run for a week starting on March 26–30, 2001.

A Saturday morning incarnation, Toonami Rising Sun, ran from 2000 to 2001 at 9:00 am to noon. It later ran from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, then 11:00 am to 1:00 pm. This block was somewhat hampered to avoid competing with sister network Kids&#x27; WB.

Starting in September 2000, Toonami presented special interactive events known as Total Immersion Events (TIEs). These TIEs took place both on-air during Toonami and online at the official site, Toonami.com, and always occurred the week that the block&#x27;s most popular series, &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, returned for a new season. The first TIE was &quot;The Intruder&quot;, which introduced T.O.M.&#x27;s companion, an AI matrix known as Sara (voiced by Sally Timms, singer for the British band The Mekons) &quot;The Intruder&quot; was an eight episode mini-series that aired during Toonami from September 18 to September 22, 2000—November 6, 2000 to November 24, 2000. It involved the &quot;Absolution&quot; being attacked by an alien blob known only as &quot;the Intruder&quot;, which ultimately devoured T.O.M.

==== 2000–03: T.O.M. 2 era ====
Though &quot;The Intruder&quot; resulted in the destruction of T.O.M., he was soon after upgraded by S.A.R.A. from a short Bomberman-esque character to a taller, sleeker, deeper-voiced incarnation dubbed T.O.M. 2 (voiced by Steve Blum, who has since been the voice of all subsequent incarnations of the character).

On May 15, 2001, Cartoon Network released &quot;Toonami: Deep Space Bass&quot;, the official soundtrack album to the TV block.

From July 30, 2001, until June 28, 2002, Kids&#x27; WB (also owned by Time Warner) aired a Toonami block that was, more or less, the Kids&#x27; WB lineup with the Toonami name. Although &quot;Toonami on Kids&#x27; WB&quot; brought over shows such as &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; to broadcast television, it was critically panned by industry observers, who noticed that the action branding of the block - which had added shows such as &quot;Generation O!&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, and &quot;The Nightmare Room&quot;, a live-action series created by &quot;Goosebumps&quot; author R. L. Stine - did not translate content-wise. And while the cross promotion between Cartoon Network and Kids&#x27; WB did allow for series to be shared between the networks, most of these only lasted a short period of time. This included &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; appearing on &quot;Toonami on Kids&#x27; WB&quot; for only two weeks, and &quot;Cardcaptors&quot; appearing on the main Toonami block on Cartoon Network for only two weeks. In spring 2002, Kids&#x27; WB announced that they would drop the Toonami name from their weekday lineup, once again making the Toonami brand exclusive to Cartoon Network.

The TIE, &quot;Lockdown&quot;, aired between September 17–21, 2001, and included the introduction of CartoonNetwork.com&#x27;s first MMORPG, called &quot;Toonami Lockdown&quot;, as well as a record-breaking amount of page views and ratings for the network. In &quot;Lockdown&quot; T.O.M. fights to save the &quot;Absolution&quot; from an attack by a giant trash compactor. &quot;Trapped in Hyperspace&quot;, the next TIE, ran the week of September 16–20, 2002. Sara gets taken offline by a computer virus named Swayzak (whose voice actor is unknown but is speculated to be Khary Payton), and TOM is trapped in hyperspace. He manages to defeat Swayzak before the &quot;Absolution&quot; hits Earth. The game tie-in for this event is lost.

During the week of February 24–28, 2003, Cartoon Network aired on Toonami &quot;Giant Robot Week,&quot; a five-day special based on mecha series, which were licensed by A.D. Vision. The series shown were &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;Gigantor&quot;, &quot;Robotech&quot;, &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot;, and &quot;Dai-Guard&quot;.

==== 2003–07: T.O.M. 3 era ====
In March 2003, TOM was revamped into a more muscular figure. This was explained in-universe as him being rebuilt after fighting a space pirate named Orcelot Rex in the comic &quot;Endgame&quot;. His voice also became more humanlike.

In September 2003, a mini series premiered introducing a new, 2D universe. &quot;Immortal Grand Prix&quot; (&quot;IGPX&quot;), created by Toonami producers Sean Akins and Jason DeMarco, and produced by anime studio Production I.G, aired in five short installments, serving as a pilot for the second Toonami original series, which premiered in November 2005.

On April 17, 2004, Toonami was moved from weekday afternoons to a Saturday evening slot, where it aired regularly for four hours starting at 7:00 pm EST. A new lighter-toned action block, Miguzi, premiered two weekdays in its place. Toonami also replaced the block known as Saturday Video Entertainment System (SVES). The reason behind the changes were that the network thought Toonami&#x27;s audience had gotten older than what was desired for weekday afternoon programming. The new Toonami lineup showcased anime such as &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Rave Master&quot;, &quot;Duel Masters&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo&quot;, &quot;Zatch Bell!&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Chronicles&quot;, as well as premiered North American productions including &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, &quot;Megas XLR&quot;, &quot;The Batman&quot;, &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, and &quot;IGPX&quot;, Toonami&#x27;s first and only original production co-produced by Production I.G and Bandai Entertainment. Sara got a full body during this period, and became more anime-esque, along with her voice actress being changed to British actress and &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; star Samantha Robson.

In 2006, the block decided to celebrate their anniversary and Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s 65th birthday by having a four-week celebration called &quot;A Month of Miyazaki&quot; in which they aired a Studio Ghibli film each week. The parent company of Cartoon Network had already done so earlier in the year on a sister channel, Turner Classic Movies and wanted to repeat it again. The promotion also included original CG animation created for the block.

* March 18 – &quot;Spirited Away&quot;
* March 25 – &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;
* April 1 – &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;
* April 8 – &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;

Although &quot;Megas XLR&quot; was the first original American-made franchise to actually debut on the block, it was initially a Cartoon Network original that was planned to air on Friday nights. Other Cartoon Network action properties, namely &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, and &quot;Justice League&quot;, aired on Toonami, but were not exclusive to the block until their final seasons.

==== 2007–08: T.O.M. 4 era and cancellation ====
On January 27, 2007, a teaser commercial aired during the &quot;Xiaolin Showdown&quot; marathon on Cartoon Network, featuring closeup shots of larger Clydes (the remote robot explorers that have been a fixture of Toonami since the beginning) and two new robot A.I&#x27;s along with the date &quot;3/17/07&quot; and T.O.M.&#x27;s chest emblem glowing blue. On March 17, Toonami celebrated its 10th anniversary with a new packaging and numerous montages celebrating the block. T.O.M. was revamped into a shorter robot with more humanoid facial features who was a commander of a jungle control room and aided by two new robots, Flash (Dave Wittenberg) and D (Tom Kenny). The montages included a look at past hosts, former logos, and a decade&#x27;s worth of clips and voice-overs from shows that aired on Toonami. There were a total of four montages, each with different clips, and three were one minute long.

As part of the anniversary (and to coincide with Cartoon Network&#x27;s March Movie Madness event), Toonami planned another month of movies:
* March 3 – &quot;The Invincible Iron Man&quot;
* March 10 – &quot;Mosaic&quot;
* March 17 – &quot;&quot;
* March 24 – &quot;Stan Lee Presents: The Condor&quot;
* March 31 – &quot;Spirited Away&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo&quot;

On September 20, 2008, at the Anime Weekend Atlanta convention in Atlanta, Georgia, Cartoon Network announced that they had cancelled the Toonami block due to low ratings. Toonami then aired its final broadcast later that same evening. The final show to air on the block was a rerun of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; at 10:30 PM. Employees who worked on the block moved to other parts of the channel, except for Dennis Moloney, who left Turner to work for Disney. Toonami Jetstream remained with the Toonami name until January 30, 2009. At the end of Toonami&#x27;s final airing, T.O.M. 4 ended the block with a brief, final monologue, backed by the song &quot;Cascade&quot; by Tycho:

After Toonami&#x27;s final episode on TV, Toonami Jetstream&#x27;s subsequent shutdown in 2009 marked the end of this incarnation until the brand&#x27;s revival in 2012.

=== Adult Swim (2012–present) ===
==== 2012–13: T.O.M. 3.5 era ====
On April 1, 2012, Adult Swim aired the Toonami block for their annual April Fools&#x27; Day prank, in which would be the annual airing of &quot;The Room&quot;. After airing that week&#x27;s scheduled episode of &quot;Bleach&quot;, the Toonami-related programming continued throughout the night, featuring shows such as &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;, &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;, &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;, &quot;The Big O&quot;, &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, &quot;Blue Submarine No. 6&quot;, &quot;Trigun&quot;, &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (1963), and &quot;Gigantor&quot;. The following day, Adult Swim posted a message to their Twitter page, simply stating, &quot;Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami&quot;. On April 4, Adult Swim followed up this tweet with one stating, &quot;#BringBackToonami We&#x27;ve heard you. Thank you for your passion and interest - stay tuned.&quot; On April 8, Adult Swim aired two bumpers about the Toonami tweets and answered with &quot;[we&#x27;re listening]&quot; and &quot;[we&#x27;re looking into it]&quot;.

On May 16, Adult Swim posted a message on Facebook announcing that Toonami would return on May 26. The network issued a press release later that day confirming the block&#x27;s revival as a Saturday late-night action block. Toonami made its return on May 26, with an initial lineup consisting of current Adult Swim Action programs, along with premieres of &quot;Deadman Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Casshern Sins&quot;. On August 18, &quot;Samurai 7&quot; and &quot;Eureka Seven&quot; replaced &quot;Deadman Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. In essence, the revived block is very similar to the Midnight Run of the original, airing uncut programming as well as having more mature themes.

On October 6, Toonami expanded to a full six hours; &quot;Sym-Bionic Titan&quot; and &quot;ThunderCats&quot; were added to the block. &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; was announced as the next premiere on November 3, as was the return of &quot;Inuyasha&quot;. On November 22, Toonami announced they would air uncut episodes of &quot;Naruto&quot;, and confirmed that &quot;Bleach&quot; would enter reruns for eight weeks, beginning on December 1.

On January 6, 2013, Toonami introduced a new blue color scheme, after using a similar scheme to introduce &quot;Inuyasha&quot; on November 3 of the previous year. New episodes of &quot;Bleach&quot; began on January 26. On February 16, &quot;Soul Eater&quot; began airing on Toonami, replacing &quot;Samurai 7&quot;. During MomoCon, new designs for both T.O.M and the &quot;Absolution&quot; were unveiled, along with the announcement that overall design of the block would be changed.

==== 2013–19: T.O.M. 5 era ====
On April 27, 2013, Toonami premiered its new look, featuring the return of supporting host Sara (now voiced by Adult Swim staff member Dana Swanson.) In December 2013, Toonami aired various films for the whole month similar to &quot;A Month of Miyazaki&quot; which aired years prior. The programming was called &quot;Toonami Month of Movies&quot;. The first film included in the lineup was &quot;Akira&quot;, which marked the first R-rated film to be aired on Toonami. All of the films shown were new for the network.

* December 7 – &quot;Akira&quot;
* December 14 – &quot;Summer Wars&quot;
* December 21 – &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa&quot;
* December 28 – &quot;&quot;

To kick off 2014, Toonami premiered the anime &quot;Space Dandy&quot; on January 4, even before Japan. The anime ran for two seasons and 26 episodes before ending that September. The block introduced a new aesthetic on April 6. This new look also featured the return of the &quot;Ninja Tune&quot; record label to Toonami. In December 2014, Toonami celebrated a second &quot;Toonami Month of Movies&quot;. This time, they aired two films each week instead of one. The airing not only included new, extended versions, and old films previously aired on Toonami but also the final episodes of Hellsing Ultimate.

* December 6 – &quot;Hellsing Ultimate: Hellsing IX&quot; and &quot;Summer Wars&quot;
* December 13 – &quot;Hellsing Ultimate: Hellsing X&quot; and &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos&quot;
* December 20 – &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Broly – The Legendary Super Saiyan&quot; and &quot;Akira&quot;
* December 27 – &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;

&quot;Intruder II&quot;, the first Total Immersion Event since Toonami&#x27;s 2012 revival, began on November 7 and concluded on December 20, 2015, with Sonny Strait reprising his role as The Intruder with Steve Blum, who also is The Intruder and TOM 5. On December 2, 2015, Adult Swim announced that a new season of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; was being produced. It ended up premiering on Toonami in March 2017. The conclusion of &quot;Intruder III&quot; in 2016 led to another new look to Toonami.

On December 31, 2016, Toonami aired its first subtitled anime broadcast with the music video of Porter Robinson and Madeon&#x27;s &quot;Shelter&quot;, produced in collaboration with A-1 Pictures and Crunchyroll. However, the subtitled parts in both the start and end of the music video have been removed due to an unknown error. As of right now, it is unknown that the full version of the music video could air in the future, besides being available on Crunchyroll and Robinson&#x27;s YouTube channel.

A fifth T.I.E. titled &quot;Countdown&quot; was released from November 4 through November 25, 2017. It centers T.O.M. being sent into the future where SARA takes over the Vindication after passing through an unknown nebula while his future counterpart travels to the present to destroy the ship to prevent her from becoming evil. The event concluded with T.O.M. having scratches and minimal damage on his body.

On March 20, 2018, Production I.G. and Adult Swim announced that two new seasons of FLCL, &quot;FLCL Progressive&quot;, and &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot; would premiere on Toonami in 2018, with the date set for June 2 at 11:30PM. On April Fools&#x27; Day 2018, Toonami was entirely dubbed in Japanese and kicked the prank off by airing a preview of the first episode of &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot; in Japanese with English subtitles. The Toonami logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as トゥナミ). Toonami followed the sneak preview by airing the film &quot;Mind Game&quot; and aired programming after that was originally scheduled after &quot;Black Clover&quot;, except &quot;Iron-Blooded Orphans&quot;, in original Japanese with English subtitles. The English dubbed version of all of the programs that have aired on that week, including a review of &quot;Nier Automata&quot;, except for the sneak preview of &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot;, as well as &quot;Mind Game&quot; and &quot;Scavengers&quot;, would air a week later. TOM was voiced by Masa Kanome, a Japanese stunt actor who had been in a Wolverine movie, and Sara was voiced by Fusako Shiotani. Sentai Studios was responsible for producing English subtitles for TOM and SARA&#x27;s dialogue.

On September 29, Toonami expanded to seven full hours from 9 PM to 4 AM with &quot;&quot; as the marquee addition. On December 13, it was announced that Toonami would remove &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot; and &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; from its lineup, cutting the block down to 6 hours. Also, the block would be moved back and would air from 11 PM-5 AM, starting on January 5, 2019, because of Adult Swim taking back the 8 PM hour from Cartoon Network.

==== 2019–present: T.O.M. 6 era ====

During the Total Immersion Event in November 2019, T.O.M. 5 was killed by the Forge Commander, in which T.O.M. called him &quot;Booger&quot;, in episode 4 of &quot;The Forge&quot;. This signaled the ending of TOM 5&#x27;s service as the host of Toonami&#x27;s programming block, which began back in 2013. This iteration of T.O.M. was the longest running host in Toonami history. In episode 5, SARA revived TOM by using the Forge to create a new body, therefore, occurring the birth of T.O.M. 6.

On January 8, 2020, it was announced that &quot;Sword Art Online: Alicization – War of Underworld&quot; would premiere on the network on January 18.

On February 6, it was announced that the block would lose another one and a half hours, as &quot;Dr. Stone&quot; was ending its run, while reruns of &quot;The Promised Neverland&quot; and &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; would also cease. This reduced the length of the block to three and a half hours, which aired from 11:30 PM to 3:00 AM. On April 8, it was announced that Toonami would be reduced to a three-hour block, as &quot;Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld&quot; was ending its run. On April 15, it was announced that &quot;Paranoia Agent&quot; would premiere on April 25 and that &quot;Food Wars: Shokugeki no Soma&quot; would be removed from the block until a new agreement was struck for the next season. On June 3, it was announced that the run of &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind&quot; would be put on hold due to dubbing production problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Adult Swim original series &quot;&quot; temporarily replacing it on Toonami starting on June 6.

On July 26, it was announced that &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind&quot; would be returning on August 1, starting with episode 29.

However, the block&#x27;s on-air branding package was not used that night due to the runtime of the film.

On January 8, 2022, Toonami announced that they would be airing a new show every week &quot;for the next month or so&quot; beginning with the second season of Assassination Classroom. They later announced the arrival of &quot;Made in Abyss&quot;, return of &quot;One Piece&quot;, premiere date of &quot;Shenmue the Animation&quot;, and arrival of the second part of the fourth season of &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;. On February 19, 2022, a second round of &quot;Cosmo Samurai&quot; episodes began premiering to celebrate the block&#x27;s 25th anniversary, with Sentai Studios producing the English subtitles. On March 13, 2022, it was announced that a new T.I.E., &quot;The Return&quot;, would air in two parts to celebrate the block&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

== Online video services ==
=== Toonami Reactor ===
On March 26, 2001, Cartoon Network launched Toonami Reactor, their first online streaming video service. The three-month service featured streaming episodes from &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; and &quot;Star Blazers&quot;, the latter of which was an online-exclusive series. Editorial content was provided by the now-defunct &quot;Animerica Magazine&quot;, published by Viz Media. After the three-month &quot;trial run&quot; was over, Cartoon Network took it offline and completely revamped it.

On November 14, 2001, Cartoon Network relaunched Toonami Reactor with all online-exclusive programs such as &quot;Star Blazers&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Harlock Saga&quot;, and &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot;, as well as videos from Daft Punk and Toonami-themed games. In the summer of 2002, Toonami Reactor was revamped again under the Adult Swim aegis and, in a joint venture with Viz&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;, programmed it as &quot;Adult Swim Pipeline.&quot; It featured episodes and/or manga chapters from &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Shaman King&quot;, &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, and &quot;Sand Land.&quot;

=== Toonami Jetstream ===

On April 25, 2006, Cartoon Network and VIZ Media announced plans to launch Toonami Jetstream, a new ad-supported streaming video service featuring Toonami series like &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;Megas XLR&quot;, and &quot;IGPX&quot;, and the Internet webcast premieres of &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot;, &quot;MÄR&quot;, &quot;Eyeshield 21&quot;, &quot;The Prince of Tennis, MegaMan Star Force&quot;, &quot;Kiba&quot;, &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, the latter two of which were never streamed.

Toonami Jetstream launched on July 17, 2006 (after a brief unofficial sneak preview that began on July 14), and offered episodes of &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot;, &quot;MÄR&quot;, &quot;Zatch Bell!&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Blue Dragon&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;Kiba&quot;, &quot;Storm Hawks&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

On January 31, 2009, Toonami Jetstream was discontinued. Since then, many of the shows aired until cancellation aired on Cartoon Network Video on its main website.

In 2012, Adult Swim rebranded their action videos section as &quot;Toonami shows.&quot; It initially featured content from &quot;Durarara!!&quot;, which never aired on the Toonami block.

=== Toonami: Pre-Flight ===
On February 27, 2015, adultswim.com launched the online show &quot;Toonami: Pre-Flight&quot; hosted by Toonami producers Jason DeMarco and Gill Austin. The first two episodes premiered on a Friday at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, and was then moved to Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time until September 25, 2015, when the show was moved back to Fridays at 6:30 p.m. Eastern time. Each episode features a series highlight, a weekly topic and other featurettes like sneak peeks at promos and spots, as well as announcements, and segments from voiceover talent Steve Blum and Dana Swanson. Toonami has also done panels from MomoCon, San Diego Comic-Con, Dragon Con and Anime Expo which they&#x27;ve streamed as part of Pre-Flight either live or on tape delay. On November 14, 2020, &quot;Toonami: Pre-Flight&quot; aired its final episode.

=== Crunchyroll ===
The anime-oriented streaming service company Crunchyroll became a sibling asset to Adult Swim after AT&amp;T&#x27;s acquisition of Time Warner, and its subsequent acquisition of the remaining shares in AT&amp;T&#x27;s existing venture Otter Media. In March 2019, Adult Swim and Otter were briefly placed under Warner Bros. as part of a corporate reorganization. The corresponding announcement stated that there would be synergies between Toonami and the service; the two properties had already announced a collaboration on &quot;Blade Runner: Black Lotus&quot;, an anime series set within the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; universe. In July 2020, Adult Swim and Crunchyroll announced a new anime series collaboration, titled &quot;&quot;. At the virtual Crunchyroll Expo in September 2020, the two entities announced yet another collaboration titled &quot;&quot;, an anime series based on the video game series by Sega. The collaboration between Toonami and Crunchyroll was ended after Sony Pictures Entertainment/Aniplex acquired Crunchyroll in 2021.

== Video game reviews ==
Throughout its history, Toonami has aired brief reviews of video games during commercial breaks. The reviews are primarily written by Jason DeMarco and based on his own experiences with the games. Transcripts of the reviews could also be found on Toonami&#x27;s website, including for games that did not have a corresponding video such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup&quot;, &quot;Animal Crossing: Wild World&quot;, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack: The Amulet of Time&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Relish Rampage&quot;, &quot;Costume Quest 2&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&quot;, &quot;Cartoon Network: Battle Crashers&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: Battle for New York&quot;, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, &quot;Doom Eternal&quot;, &quot;Shovel Knight&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time&quot;, &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops III&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: Carbon&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil&quot;, &quot;Far Cry 5&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot;, &quot;Cartoon Network: Block Party&quot;, &quot;Cartoon Network Racing&quot;, &quot;Cartoon Network Speedway&quot;, &quot;Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: Underground 2&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed Rivals&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, &quot;Ben 10: Protector of Earth&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack: The Shadow of Aku&quot;, &quot;Steven Universe: Save the Light&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall Heroes&quot;, &quot;The Lego Ninjago Movie Video Game&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, &quot;Cuphead&quot;, &quot;Cookie Run: Kingdom&quot;, &quot;X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Trilogy: Apprentice of the Force&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Medal of Honor&quot;, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, &quot;Front Mission 3&quot;, &quot;Grandia&quot;, and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. The rating system for games was originally 1–5, until it was increased to a 1-10 scaled in 2000. Beginning in March 2021, games also receive three additional individual ratings for graphics, sound, and gameplay.

Seven games have received ratings not based on the 1-10 scale. &quot;&quot; was given a &quot;?&quot; rating, because TOM could not get past the sixth level. Similarly, &quot;&quot; also received a &quot;?&quot; rating, because TOM was too frightened to continue playing. &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag&quot; was given an &quot;ARRRRRR!&quot; rating to reflect on the game&#x27;s pirate theme. &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla&quot; received &quot;a barbaric yawp&quot;. &quot;198X&quot; received an &quot;Incomplete 7/10&quot; due to the game&#x27;s short length and hints of a sequel. &quot;Ninja Kamui: Shinobi Origins&quot; received a &quot;N/A&quot; rating due to being not released at the time of the review. It was also mentioned that it is available for pre-order.

<doc id="654698" wikidata="Q242623" url="?curid=654698" title="Rena Sofer">
<text>Rena Sherel Sofer (born December 2, 1968) is an American actress, known for her appearances in daytime television, episodic guest appearances, and made-for-television movies. In 1995, Sofer received a Daytime Emmy Award for her portrayal of Lois Cerullo in the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She reprised the role of Lois in October 2023. From 2013 to 2022, she played Quinn Fuller on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

== Early life ==
Sofer was born in Arcadia, California, the daughter of Susan Sofer (née Franzblau), a psychology professor, and Martin Sofer, an Orthodox rabbi.
She moved with her father and brother David to Teaneck, New Jersey, in 1970. However, when Sofer was 5 years old, they resided in Western Pennsylvania. They lived in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, where her father led Beth Samuels Jewish Center.
She later attended the Frisch School, a coeducational Modern Orthodox Jewish high school in Paramus, New Jersey. Sofer lived in North Bergen, New Jersey, where her father was rabbi of synagogue Temple Beth El. She graduated from North Bergen High School, then attended classes at Montclair State College.

== Career ==

===Daytime television===
Sofer first played Lois Marie Cerullo on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Her first appearance was in 1993 as a band manager. However, her first high-profile role was as Rocky McKenzie on the daytime soap opera &quot;Loving&quot; (1988–1991).

Sofer is perhaps best known for her role as Lois Cerullo on &quot;General Hospital&quot; (December 15, 1993 – September 24, 1996). She later returned as a guest star (February 7–17, 1997; September 30 – October 2, 1997). Her portrayal of the outrageous Lois won Sofer a Daytime Emmy Award in 1995 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.

In May 2013, it was announced that Sofer would join the CBS soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, in a newly created role of Quinn Fuller; her first episode aired on July 12. After nine years on the canvas, Sofer opted to end her run in the role of Quinn; she last aired on August 29, 2022.

On September 14, 2023, &quot;People&quot; announced Sofer would reprise the role of Lois on &quot;General Hospital&quot; after a 26-year absence.

=== Primetime television ===
Sofer has appeared in several high-profile prime time television series in a guest star/supporting cast member roles: &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Ed&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot;, &quot;Blind Justice&quot;, &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, and &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;.

Sofer briefly joined the cast of the NBC sitcom &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;, playing the character Vicky Costa. The network later cast Sofer in the short-lived US remake of the UK series &quot;Coupling&quot;.
In recent years, Rena Sofer has appeared in the NBC TV series &quot;Heroes&quot; as the recurring character Heidi Petrelli, wife of aspiring politician Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar). She appeared on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; in 2008, as a former girlfriend of the character Charlie Harper (Charlie Sheen). Rena also has guest starred on &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot; playing an intrepid reporter and played a ghost on &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;. In early 2010, Sofer began a recurring role on &quot;NCIS&quot; as attorney Margaret Allison Hart, a potential love interest for the character Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon). She had a brief guest role on &quot;Bones&quot; as a love interest for the character Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz).

In 2013, Sofer had a publicized appearance on &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, playing Snow White&#x27;s mother.

=== Film ===
In film, she appeared as a love interest of Ben Stiller&#x27;s character in the film &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot;, starring Jenna Elfman, Stiller and Edward Norton (who also directed). She also played a bride to-be with Melanie Griffith in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s movie &quot;A Stranger Among Us&quot; and in Penelope Buitenhuis&#x27;s movie &quot;The Secret of Hidden Lake&quot;.

She played the P.E. teacher Ms. Desjarden in the television film adaptation of &quot;Carrie&quot; in 2002. She starred in the television movie &quot;Always and Forever&quot; which aired October 24, 2009, on the Hallmark Channel. She has been doing TV movies since 1992, when she starred as Andrea Larson in the television movie &quot;Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Sofer and her &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star Wally Kurth, who played her onscreen love interest, became involved as their characters&#x27; storyline progressed. In 1995, the actors were married and had a daughter, Rosabel Rosalind Kurth. In 1997, Sofer and Kurth divorced.

Sofer married television director and producer Sanford Bookstaver in 2003. On August 5, 2005, Sofer gave birth to her second daughter, her first with Bookstaver, in Los Angeles. Sofer and Bookstaver eventually divorced in 2017. In 2019, Sofer announced they had reconciled and in April announced their engagement, and they later remarried in 2024.

<text>The Doctors is an American daytime soap opera television series which aired on NBC from April 1, 1963, to December 31, 1982.

==From anthology to serial==
&quot;The Doctors&quot; debuted on April 1, 1963, using an anthology format with different characters in each story; this was in contrast to all of the other daytime dramas on air at the time. The viewership numbers were not encouraging, however: in that first season, &quot;The Doctors&quot; pulled only a 3.4 rating, next-to-worst among network TV soaps. Beginning on March 2, 1964, however, &quot;the Doctors&quot; became a traditional continuing serial, more than doubling the ratings to 7.5 mark.

For most of the series, storylines revolved around Hope Memorial Hospital and its patriarch Chief of staff Dr. Matt Powers (played by James Pritchett), who started on the program on July 9, 1963, although Pritchett originally appeared on the series during its weekly anthology period, in another role.

The cast for the original daily concept, which lasted from the premiere on April 1, 1963, until July 19, 1963, was:

*Jock Gaynor as Dr. William Scott (April 1, 1963 – July 19, 1963, premiere cast)
*Richard Roat as Dr. Jerry Chandler (April 1, 1963 – January 17, 1964, premiere cast)
*Margot Moser as Dr. Elizabeth Hayes (April 1, 1963 – July 19, 1963, premiere cast)
*Fred J. Scollay as Rev. Sam Shafer (April 1, 1963 – 1966, premiere cast)

The early cast for the second, weekly concept, which lasted from July 22, 1963, until February 28, 1964, was:

*Richard Roat as Dr. Jerry Chandler (April 1, 1963 – January 17, 1964, premiere cast)
*Fred J. Scollay as Rev. Sam Shafer (April 1, 1963 – 1966, premiere cast)
*James Pritchett as Dr. Matt Powers (July 22, 1963 – December 31, 1982)
*Rex Thompson as Michael Powers (July 22, 1963 – 1966)
*Ann Williams as Dr. Maggie Fielding (July 22, 1963 – May 25, 1965)
*Joseph Campanella as Alec Fielding (August 19–23, 1963)
*Ruth McDevitt as Mrs. McMurtrie (Rev. Shafer&#x27;s housekeeper) (September 16, 1963 - July 9, 1964)
*Charles Braswell as Alec Fielding (January 20 – February 11, 1964)
*Scott Graham as Dr. Johnny McGill (January 20, 1964 – December 1964)
*Joan Anderson as Nora Hansen Lloyd (March 9, 1964 – 1966)

==Storylines==
In the program&#x27;s early years, &quot;The Doctors&quot; was considered to be more bold in storyline choices than its primary rival at the time, &quot;General Hospital&quot; (which premiered on the same day, with a similar premise to &quot;TD&quot;). While the doctors on &quot;General Hospital&quot; worked in harmony with one another for the most part and in some cases were intimate friends, the physicians on &quot;The Doctors&quot; were shown in stories that balanced personal and professional concerns. Some doctors were depicted as competitive and cutthroat. &quot;The Doctors&quot; incorporated humor and realism into its storylines, and remained anchored to actual medical work in its setting.

For example, when Matt Powers was on trial for murder, he was forced to rescind his Chief of Staff position. His successor schemed to remove his allies, such as Dr. Althea Davis, from positions of influence in the hospital. Althea&#x27;s stories included her challenges as a female doctor working with a mainly male staff; one story outlined how Althea&#x27;s divorce was discussed by the board as a moral issue in a way that no male doctor&#x27;s personal life had ever been discussed.

==Awards and production==
In 1972 and 1974, the serial received a Daytime Emmy Award for Best Drama. During that period until a new opening sequence was created in 1977, announcer Mel Brandt (who was also known for his announcing the animated &quot;Laramie Peacock&quot; color opening in the 1960s and 1970s) would inform the audience at the beginning of each episode: &quot;And now, The Doctors, (The Emmy-Award winning program) dedicated to the brotherhood of healing.&quot; The iconic theme song &quot;Patterns&quot;, which was updated with a new version in 1977 and 1979, stayed with the program through August 1, 1980 and was composed by in-house musician Bob Israel at Score Productions. It debuted with the episode which aired on May 24, 1971.

Episodes of &quot;The Doctors&quot; were originally taped in black and white at Studio 3B, one of NBC&#x27;s production studios at 30 Rockefeller Center in New York City. It was the last NBC daytime serial to transition from black and white to color on October 17, 1966.

== Broadcast history ==

===Original series run===
From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, &quot;The Doctors&quot; ranked as one of the top five daytime dramas in the United States. It peaked at fourth place in the 1973–1974 television season, behind CBS&#x27; &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and fellow NBC serials &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot;. However, within a period of three years, &quot;The Doctors&quot; plummeted from fourth to eleventh in the ratings. The decline in ratings was partly attributed to two serials with which &quot;The Doctors&quot; shared its timeslot: ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, which expanded to an hour in consecutive years; &quot;Guiding Light&quot; made this move in 1977, while &quot;One Life To Live&quot; along with fellow ABC soap &quot;General Hospital&quot; expanded in 1978.

As the 1978–79 season began, the entire NBC soap opera lineup was suffering in the ratings. While &quot;The Doctors&quot; was not alone in this, the network began a series of relocations involving the veteran serial that year, which would amplify the series&#x27; ratings trouble and eventually lead to its demise. The first move was done to help boost the ratings of &quot;Another World&quot;, which after tying for the top spot in the daytime serial ratings in 1978 had dropped to eighth place in 1979. In an unprecedented (and since unrepeated) move, NBC decided to extend &quot;Another World&quot; and make it the first serial to run for 90 minutes daily. &quot;The Doctors&quot;, as part of the schedule shuffle that ensued, was moved to 2:00/1:00p, which placed it against the second half of &quot;As The World Turns&quot; on CBS and the first half of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; on ABC. The ratings declined slightly, but NBC was not done.

Procter &amp; Gamble Productions (PGP), the producers of &quot;Another World&quot;, began development on a new serial in 1980 that would evolve into a spin-off of that serial set in Houston. The new program, &quot;Texas&quot;, was picked up by NBC who envisioned it as a daytime version of CBS&#x27; hit primetime drama &quot;Dallas&quot;. NBC needed to free up one hour of its schedule for &quot;Texas&quot;, and did so by cutting the runtimes of &quot;Another World&quot; (which reverted to its previous 60-minute slot) and &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; by 30 minutes each. Launching on August 4, 1980, &quot;Texas&quot; was placed in the 3:00/2:00 p.m. hour with &quot;Another World&quot; moving to 2:00/1:00 to serve as its lead-in.

&quot;The Doctors&quot; was once again displaced as a result of the move, being shifted to the only open spot on the network&#x27;s lineup, the 12:30 p.m./11:30 a.m. slot following &quot;Card Sharks&quot;. The noon hour would often see affiliates of the three major networks opt not to air their offerings for at least part of, if not all of, the timeslot and usually air a local newscast or some other programming, and &quot;The Doctors&quot; disappeared from some markets when it made the move. In addition, the 12:30 timeslot was a competitive one for the three networks. ABC&#x27;s competition came from &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, which had been beating &quot;The Doctors&quot; by nearly a full ratings point in the overall rankings. The serial&#x27;s competition on CBS originally consisted of the long-running &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, which was also pulling in significantly higher ratings than &quot;The Doctors&quot; had been. In June 1981, CBS moved &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; to 12:30 and the ratings faded even further. &quot;The Doctors&quot; fell to a 3.8 rating at the end of the 1980–81 season, which was tied for last place with &quot;Texas&quot;.

NBC had not completed its reshuffling of the daytime lineup, though, and a Procter &amp; Gamble serial was again at the forefront for the latest shift. In addition to the aforementioned &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot;, PGP was the production company for &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;. When &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; was moved, it took over the timeslot that had been home to &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; since its 1951 premiere. PGP was not willing to renew its contract with CBS to continue carrying the serial unless the network was willing to move it back to its original time; as things stood, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; was airing at 2:30/1:30, which placed it against the second half of its fellow PGP production &quot;Another World&quot;.

NBC, however, was willing to do what CBS would not and began negotiating with PGP to move the long-running serial to its daytime lineup. NBC agreed to return &quot;Search&quot; to 12:30 p.m./11:30 a.m., which it did upon moving to the network on March 29, 1982. Once again, this required a shuffling of the schedule. On the day &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; switch from CBS to NBC one final time change was made for &quot;The Doctors&quot; to 30 minutes earlier now starting at noon a time slot that had been occupied by &quot;Password Plus&quot;, which was cancelled to make room for &quot;Search&quot; for Tomorrow.&quot;

Both moves did not help matters, as NBC&#x27;s serial lineup as a whole had been struggling for some time. &quot;The Doctors&quot; continued to be the lowest rated of the group, and the move to noon exacerbated the issue. The only serial ahead of it in the ratings was its new stablemate, which saw viewership drop by half after its move from CBS. NBC tried to remedy the situation by cancelling two more of its game shows, &quot;Battlestars&quot; and &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, and using that sixty minutes to relocate &quot;Texas&quot;, which had not found an audience, to 11:00/10:00 a.m. on April 26, 1982, so it could serve as the lead in for the two veteran serials airing in the noon hour. The move did not work as all three serials finished with lower ratings; &quot;The Doctors&quot; saw its ratings cut even more, eventually falling below a 2.0.

NBC announced the cancellation of &quot;The Doctors&quot; (along with that of &quot;Texas&quot;) during the fall of 1982, and the last episode aired on December 31, 1982. The show once again finished in last place as part of the still-struggling NBC daytime lineup, which failed to see one of its serials finish in the top five in the final Nielsens for a fifth consecutive season. The ratings for &quot;The Doctors&quot; bottomed out at 1.6, less than half of what they were the year before and nearly one-fourth of what they were three years earlier. The final number broke a record set by the short-lived ABC soap &quot;The Best of Everything&quot;, which pulled a 1.8 rating at the conclusion of its only season in 1970; only &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; (1997–1999) and &quot;Passions&quot; (1999–2007), two later NBC serials, finished a season with a lower final rating.

The ninety minutes freed up by the cancellations of &quot;The Doctors&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot; were filled by game shows beginning the following Monday. &quot;The Doctors&quot; saw its place taken by &quot;Just Men!&quot;, which was cancelled after thirteen weeks. The noon timeslot would not receive a stable show until &quot;Super Password&quot; premiered in September 1984, which ran until March 1989.

==Reruns==
In July 2014, Retro TV announced that it would begin broadcasting reruns of &quot;The Doctors&quot; in the latter half of the year, starting with episodes from December 1967.

On September 29, 2014, the network began airing two episodes of &quot;The Doctors&quot; each weekday, starting at 12 p.m. (ET)/11 a.m. (CT).

Retro TV started off their reruns of &quot;The Doctors&quot; in September 2014 with the episode which originally aired December 4, 1967, and stopped its run of episodes with the December 31, 1979 episode on April 23, 2020, at which point syndication on Retro TV restarted with the December 4, 1967 episode on April 27.

Episodes from December 1967 to September 1980 are available to watch on demand for free at Retro TV&#x27;s It&#x27;s Real Good TV site. The October 1980-December 1982 episodes were not provided to them and are apparently no longer available.

&quot;The Doctors&quot; has been distributed by SFM Entertainment, which has 4,865 episodes available for syndication, only 290 episodes short of the entire run.

As of July 2018, Retro was running the series seven days a week, but from three different periods of time, with Monday through Friday with one time frame, and then Saturday and Sunday each with two additional respective time frames in the series.

<text>Bibi Pak Daman ( &quot;&quot;) is a mausoleum confirmed to Pakistan Government by Imam Ali Raza Haram Research Centre Iran to be the tomb of Ruqayyah bint Ali in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. It holds the graves of six ladies from Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s (Peace and blessings be upon him) household (Ahl al-Bayt). Ruqayyah bint Ali ibn Abu Talib was the daughter of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abu Talib. She was the sister of Al-Abbas ibn Ali and also the wife of Muslim ibn Aqeel (emissary of third Shi&#x27;a Imam Husayn ibn Ali to Kufa). Others are said to be Muslim ibn Aqil&#x27;s sister and daughters. It is said that these ladies came here after the event of the Battle of Karbala on the 10th day of the month of Muharram in 61 AH (October 10, AD 680).

Bibi Pak Daman, which means the &quot;chaste lady&quot;, is the collective name of the six ladies believed to be interred at this mausoleum, though it is also (mistakenly) popularly used to refer to the personage of Ruqayyah bint Ali alone. They were among the women who brought Islam to South Asia, preaching and engaging in missionary activity in the environs of Lahore.

Bibi Pak Daman is located between Garhi Shahu and Railway Station area. The easiest way to go to Bibi Pak Daman is from the Empress Road and from there, take the small road opposite Police Lines and then the first left-turn. Recently Government of Pakistan is considering approval of the expansion of the Bibi Pak Daman&#x27;s shrine.

==Life==
After the events at Karbala five Muslim women, led by Ruqayyah bint Ali left Mecca to settle and proselytize in Lahore, as a result of which a sizable portion of the Hindu community entered Islam.

According to one school of thought among historians such as S.M. Latif, Molvi Noor Ahmad Chishti and Mufti Ghulam Server the daughters of Ali were instructed by their father to go to Sindh and Hind to preach the Islamic faith. It was prophesied that their mission would achieve success. The events of the massacre at Karbala caused many relatives of Muhammad including Ruqayyah to migrate to Makran where she preached Islam for several years. The Hindu Raja of Jaisalmer felt threatened by her missionary work. Umayyad rulers were also displeased and a number of Umayyad spies were dispatched to assassinate her. Among such potential assassins had been Muhammad Bin Qasim who later switched allegiances and became a supporter of Ruqayyah after learning of the sufferings experienced by the family of Muhammad.

However, continued threats to Ruqayyah&#x27;s life caused her to cross the Indus River to settle in Lahore. The local Hindu ruler there attempted to arrest her but this failed when his son, the Prince Bakrama Sahi, accepted Islam and became impressed with Ruqayyah&#x27;s work. This enabled Ruqayyah to continue her missionary activities in peace for some more time. Eventually, fearing disgrace at the hands of the Hindu Raja&#x27;s army when they were again dispatched to arrest her and the other five ladies, she gathered her female kin and made a collective prayer for rescue. As a fulfillment of their wishes, the ground split and their camp went underground. A shawl remained to mark the spot of that event.

Another school of thought among historians, including Kanhya Lal, Muhammad Aslam and Tanveer Anjum, argues that there was no reason for these Muslim women to settle in the Hindu-ruled Lahore.

==Names in history==
Seven ladies and four men are traceable from history, as it is found that she introduced herself stating that “ I am widow of Martyr Muslim bin Aqeel, daughter of Ali and sister of commander-in-chief Abbas of Imam Hussain&#x27;s Army and other five ladies were my sisters in law, whereas the sixth one was our maid “Halima” but she was equal to us in status. She introduced further telling the names of men that they were our guards and belonged to our tribes namely (i) Abb-ul-Fatah (ii) Abb-ul-Fazal (iii) Abb-ul-Mukaram, and (iv) Abdullah.

The name of first Mujawir (one who looks after the grave and cares for visitors) was Baba Khaki. Besides two names “ Ruqaya and Halima” Dr. Masood Raza Khaki, the then Deputy Director General in the Education Department (1977), Government of Punjab, traces the five names from historical records as:
:(1)Umm-e-Hani (2)Umm-e-Luqman (3) Asma (4)Ramla (5)Zainab
Historically, the first proper Khanqah was constructed by Malik Ayaz in the period of 11th Century and reconstructed in the regime of Akbar the great.

==Historical Misconceptions==
There is a very famous misconception in indian subcontinent regarding Syeda Ruqayyah bint Ali which states that This Holy lady is the Daughter of Umm ul-Banin and full sister of Abbas ibn Ali. Which in reality is a misconception as Umm ul-Banin (Meaning Mother of several sons) had no daughter.

==Urs Sharif/Death Anniversary ==
In the Islamic month of Jumada al-Thani three days urs of Bibi Pak Daman from 7 to 9 is celebrated. The Tourism Development Corporation of Punjab Limited (TDCP), Government of Punjab has placed the shrine on the list of tourist attractions.

<doc id="654705" wikidata="Q178869" url="?curid=654705" title="One Hundred Years of Solitude">
<text>One Hundred Years of Solitude (, ) is a 1967 novel by Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez that tells the multi-generational story of the Buendía family, whose patriarch, José Arcadio Buendía, founded the fictitious town of Macondo. The novel is often cited as one of the supreme achievements in world literature. It was recognized as one of the most important works of the Spanish language during the 4th International Conference of the Spanish Language held in Cartagena in March 2007.

The magical realist style and thematic substance of the book established it as an important representative novel of the literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, which was stylistically influenced by Modernism (European and North American) and the Cuban &quot;Vanguardia&quot; (Avant-Garde) literary movement.

Since it was first published in May 1967 in Buenos Aires by Editorial Sudamericana, the book has been translated into 46 languages and sold more than 50 million copies. The novel, considered García Márquez&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, remains widely acclaimed and is recognized as one of the most significant works both in the Hispanic literary canon and in world literature.

In 2024, the book was adapted into an authorized television series released on Netflix and executive produced by García Márquez&#x27;s sons.

==Background==
In 1965, Gabriel García Márquez was driving to Acapulco for a vacation with his family when he thought of the beginning for a new book; he then turned his car around, asked his wife to manage the family&#x27;s finances for the coming months, and drove back home to Mexico City. For the next eighteen months, García Márquez spent his time writing what would eventually become &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. Though inspired by Colombian history and his experiences as a journalist, García Márquez was greatly influenced by his maternal grandparents: Nicolás Ricardo Márquez and Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes. A decorated veteran of the Thousand Days&#x27; War, Ricardo Márquez&#x27;s accounts of the rebellion against the conservative Colombian government led his grandson to a socialist outlook. Meanwhile, Doña Iguarán Cotes&#x27; superstitious beliefs became the foundation of the book&#x27;s style. The couple&#x27;s house in Aracataca where García Márquez spent his childhood inspired him to make Macondo his book&#x27;s setting.

García Márquez was one of the four Latin American novelists first included in the literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s; the other three were the Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa, the Argentine Julio Cortázar, and the Mexican Carlos Fuentes. In 1967, the book earned García Márquez international fame as a novelist of the magical realism movement within Latin American literature.

==Plot==

The book tells the story of seven generations of the Buendía Family in the town of Macondo. The founders of Macondo, José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula Iguarán, leave their hometown after José Arcadio kills Prudencio Aguilar after a cockfight for suggesting José Arcadio was impotent. One night of their emigration journey, while camping on a riverbank, José Arcadio dreams of &quot;Macondo&quot;, a city of mirrors that reflected the world in and about it. Upon awakening, he decides to establish Macondo at the riverside; after days of wandering the jungle, his founding of Macondo is utopic.

José Arcadio Buendía believes Macondo to be surrounded by water, and from that island, he invents the world according to &quot;his&quot; perceptions. Soon after its founding, Macondo became a town frequented by unusual and extraordinary events that involve the generations of the Buendía family, who are unable or unwilling to escape their periodic (mostly self-inflicted) misfortunes. For years the town has been solitary and unconnected to the outside world, with the exception of the annual visit of a band of Gypsies, who show the townspeople scientific discoveries such as magnets, telescopes, and ice. The leader of the Gypsies, a man named Melquíades, maintains a close friendship with José Arcadio, who becomes increasingly withdrawn, obsessed with investigating the mysteries of the universe presented to him by the Gypsies. Ultimately, José Arcadio is driven insane, speaking only in Latin, and is tied to a chestnut tree by his family for many years until his death.

Eventually Macondo becomes exposed to the outside world and the government of newly independent Colombia. A rigged election between the Conservative and Liberal parties is held in town, inspiring Aureliano Buendía to join a civil war against the Conservative government. He becomes an iconic revolutionary leader, fighting for many years and surviving multiple attempts on his life, but ultimately tires of war and signs a peace treaty with the Conservatives. Disillusioned, he returns to Macondo and spends the rest of his life making tiny gold fish in his workshop.

The railroad comes to Macondo, bringing in new technology and many foreign settlers. An American fruit company establishes a banana plantation outside the town, and builds its own segregated village across the river. This ushers in a period of prosperity that ends in tragedy as the Colombian army massacres thousands of striking plantation workers, an incident based on the Banana Massacre of 1928. José Arcadio Segundo, the only survivor of the massacre, finds no evidence of the massacre, and the surviving townspeople deny or refuse to believe it happened.

By the novel&#x27;s end, Macondo has fallen into a decrepit and near-abandoned state, with the only remaining Buendías being Amaranta Úrsula and her nephew Aureliano, whose parentage is hidden by his grandmother Fernanda, and he and Amaranta Úrsula unknowingly begin an incestuous relationship. They have a child who bears the tail of a pig, fulfilling the lifelong fear of the long-dead matriarch Úrsula. Amaranta Úrsula dies in childbirth and the child is devoured by ants, leaving Aureliano as the last member of the family. He decodes an encryption Melquíades had left behind in a manuscript generations ago. The secret message informs the recipient of every fortune and misfortune that the Buendía family&#x27;s generations lived through. As Aureliano reads the manuscript, he feels a windstorm starting around him, and he reads in the document that the Buendía family is doomed to be wiped from the face of the Earth because of it. In the last sentence of the book, the narrator describes Aureliano reading this last line just as the entire town of Macondo is scoured from existence.

==Symbolism and metaphors==
A dominant theme in the book is the inevitable and inescapable repetition of history in Macondo. The protagonists are controlled by their pasts and the complexity of time. Throughout the novel the characters are visited by ghosts. &quot;The ghosts are symbols of the past and the haunting nature it has over Macondo. The ghosts and the displaced repetition that they evoke are, in fact, firmly grounded in the particular development of Latin American history&quot;, writes Daniel Erickson. &quot;Ideological transfiguration ensured that Macondo and the Buendías always were ghosts to some extent, alienated and estranged from their own history, not only victims of the harsh reality of dependence and underdevelopment but also of the ideological illusions that haunt and reinforce such social conditions.&quot;

The fate of Macondo is both doomed and predetermined from its very existence. &quot;Fatalism is a metaphor for the particular part that ideology has played in maintaining historical dependence, by locking the interpretation of Latin American history into certain patterns that deny alternative possibilities. The narrative seemingly confirms fatalism in order to illustrate the feeling of entrapment that ideology can performatively create.&quot;

García Márquez uses colours as symbols. Yellow and gold are the most frequently used and symbolize imperialism and the Spanish Siglo de Oro. Gold signifies a search for economic wealth, whereas yellow represents death, change, and destruction.

The glass city is an image that comes to José Arcadio Buendía in a dream. It is the reason for Macondo&#x27;s location, but also a symbol of its fate. Higgins writes, &quot;By the final page, however, the city of mirrors has become a city of mirages. Macondo thus represents the dream of a brave new world that America seemed to promise and that was cruelly proved illusory by the subsequent course of history.&quot; Images such as the glass city and the ice factory represent how Latin America already has its history outlined and is therefore fated for destruction.

There is an underlying pattern of Latin American history in the book. It has been said that the novel is one of a number of texts that &quot;Latin American culture has created to understand itself.&quot; In this sense, the novel can be conceived as a linear archive that narrates the story of a Latin America discovered by European explorers, which had its historical entity developed by the printing press. The Archive is a symbol of the literature that is the foundation of Latin American history and also a decoding instrument. Melquíades, the keeper of the archive, represents both the whimsical and the literary. Finally, &quot;the world of &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is a place where beliefs and metaphors become forms of fact, and where more ordinary facts become uncertain.&quot;

The use of particular historic events and characters renders the book an exemplary work of magical realism, wherein the novel compresses decades of cause and effect whilst telling an interesting story.

==Characters==
===First generation===
;José Arcadio Buendía
José Arcadio Buendía is the patriarch of the Buendía family and the founder of Macondo. Buendía leaves his hometown in Riohacha Municipality, Colombia, along with his wife Úrsula Iguarán after being haunted by the corpse of Prudencio Aguilar (a man Buendía killed in a duel), who constantly bleeds from his wound and tries to wash it. One night while camping at the side of a river, Buendía dreams of a city of mirrors named Macondo and decides to establish the town in this location. José Arcadio Buendía is an introspective and inquisitive man of massive strength and energy who spends more time on his scientific pursuits than with his family. He flirts with alchemy and astronomy and becomes increasingly withdrawn from his family and community. He eventually goes insane and is tied to a chestnut tree until his death.

;Úrsula Iguarán
Úrsula Iguarán is the matriarch of the Buendía family and is wife and cousin to José Arcadio Buendía. She lives to be well over 100 years old and she oversees the Buendía household through six of the seven generations documented in the novel. She has a business of making candy animals and pastries which she continues until the arrival of Fernanda. She exhibits a very strong character and often succeeds where the men of her family fail, for example finding a route to the outside world from Macondo. She deeply fears her family resuming their incestuous practices as her inbred relatives tended to have animalistic features. From a strong and active matriarch, Úrsula is reduced to a plaything for Amaranta Úrsula and Aureliano in her last years and shrinks to the size of a newborn baby when she finally dies.

===Second generation===
;José Arcadio
José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula&#x27;s firstborn child, José Arcadio seems to have inherited his father&#x27;s headstrong, impulsive mannerisms. He eventually leaves the family after being molested by Pilar Ternera to chase a Gypsy girl and unexpectedly returns many years later as an enormous man covered in tattoos, claiming that he has sailed the seas of the world. He marries his adopted sister Rebeca, causing his banishment from the mansion, and he dies from a mysterious gunshot wound, days after saving his brother from execution.

;Colonel Aureliano Buendía
José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula&#x27;s second child and the first person to be born in Macondo. He was thought to have premonitions because everything he said came true. He represents not only a warrior figure but also an artist due to his ability to write poetry and create finely crafted golden fish. During the wars he fathered 17 sons by unknown women, all named Aureliano. Four of them later begin to live in Macondo, and in the span of several weeks all of them but one (including those who chose not to remain in Macondo) are murdered by unknown assassins, before any of them had reached thirty-five years of age.

;Amaranta
José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula&#x27;s third child, Amaranta grows up as a companion of her adopted sister Rebeca. However, her feelings toward Rebeca turn sour over Pietro Crespi, whom both sisters intensely desired in their teenage years. Amaranta does everything she can to prevent Rebeca and Pietro marrying, even attempting to murder Rebeca. Amaranta dies a lonely and virginal spinster, but comfortable in her existence after having finally accepted what she had become.

In her later years, she becomes a caring figure within the Buendía household, particularly showing affection for her nephew, Aureliano José.

;Remedios Moscote
Remedios was the youngest daughter of the town&#x27;s Conservative administrator, Don Apolinar Moscote. Her most striking physical features are her beautiful skin and her emerald-green eyes. The future Colonel Aureliano falls in love with her, despite her extreme youth. She dies shortly after the marriage from a blood poisoning illness during her pregnancy. Until soon before the Colonel&#x27;s death, her dolls are displayed in his bedroom.

;Rebeca
Rebeca is the second cousin of Úrsula Iguarán and the orphaned child of Nicanor Ulloa and Rebeca Montiel. At first, she is extremely timid, refuses to speak, and has the habits of eating earth and whitewash from the walls of the house, a condition known as pica. She arrives carrying a canvas bag containing her parents&#x27; bones and seems not to understand or speak Spanish. However, she responds to questions asked by Visitación and Cataure in the Guajiro or Wayuu language. She falls in love with and marries her adoptive brother José Arcadio after his return from traveling the world. After his mysterious and untimely death, she lives in seclusion for the rest of her life.

;Pilar Ternera
Pilar is a local woman who moved to Macondo to escape the man who raped her as a teenager. She sleeps with the brothers Aureliano and José Arcadio. She becomes the mother of their sons, Aureliano José and Arcadio respectively. Pilar reads the future with cards, and every so often makes an accurate, though vague, prediction. She has close ties with the Buendías throughout the whole novel, helping them with her card predictions. She dies some time after she turns 145 years old (she had eventually stopped counting), surviving until the last days of Macondo.

She plays an integral part in the plot as she is the link between the second and the third generations of the Buendía family. The author highlights her importance by following her death with a declaratory &quot;it was the end.&quot;

===Third generation===
;Arcadio
Arcadio is José Arcadio&#x27;s illegitimate son with Pilar Ternera, although he never learns about his origins. He is a schoolteacher who assumes leadership of Macondo after Colonel Aureliano Buendía leaves. He becomes a tyrannical dictator and uses his schoolchildren as his personal army and Macondo soon becomes subject to his whims. When the Liberal forces in Macondo fall, Arcadio is shot by a Conservative firing squad.

;Aureliano José
Aureliano José is Colonel Aureliano Buendía&#x27;s illegitimate son with Pilar Ternera. He joins his father in several wars before deserting to return to Macondo upon hearing that it is possible to marry one&#x27;s aunt. Aureliano José is obsessed with his aunt, Amaranta, who raised him since birth and molested him as a child, and who rejects the marriage proposal he makes as an adult. He is eventually shot to death by a Conservative captain midway through the wars.

;Santa Sofía de la Piedad
Santa Sofía is a beautiful virgin girl and the daughter of a shopkeeper. She is hired by Pilar Ternera to have sex with her son Arcadio, her eventual husband. She is taken in along with her children by the Buendías after Arcadio&#x27;s execution. After Úrsula&#x27;s death she leaves unexpectedly, not knowing her destination.

;17 Aurelianos
During his 32 civil war campaigns, Colonel Aureliano Buendía has 17 sons by 17 different women, each named after their father. Four of these Aurelianos (A. Triste, A. Serrador, A. Arcaya and A. Centeno) stay in Macondo and become a permanent part of the family. Eventually, as revenge against the Colonel, all are assassinated by unknown assailants, who identified them by the mysteriously permanent Ash Wednesday cross on their foreheads. The only survivor of the massacre is A. Amador, who escapes into the jungle only to be assassinated at the doorstep of his father&#x27;s house many years later.

===Fourth generation===
Remedios the BeautyRemedios the Beauty is Arcadio and Santa Sofía&#x27;s first child. It is said she is the most beautiful woman ever seen in Macondo, and unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her. She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally delayed. However, Colonel Aureliano Buendía believes she has inherited great lucidity: &quot;It is as if she&#x27;s come back from twenty years of war,&quot; he said. She rejects clothing and beauty which has the opposite effect and makes her more beautiful. Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends to heaven one afternoon, while folding Fernanda&#x27;s white sheet.

;José Arcadio Segundo
José Arcadio Segundo is Aureliano Segundo&#x27;s twin brother, and one of Arcadio and Santa Sofía&#x27;s three children. Úrsula believes that the two were switched in their childhood, as José Arcadio begins to show the characteristics of the family&#x27;s Aurelianos, growing up to be pensive and quiet. He plays a major role in the banana worker strike, and is the only survivor when the company massacres the striking workers. Afterward, he spends the rest of his days studying the parchments of Melquíades, and tutoring the young Aureliano. He dies at the exact instant that his twin does.

;Aureliano Segundo
Aureliano Segundo is José Arcadio Segundo&#x27;s twin brother, and one of Arcadio and Santa Sofía&#x27;s three children. Of the two brothers, Aureliano Segundo is the more boisterous and impulsive, much like the José Arcadios of the family. He takes his first girlfriend Petra Cotes as his mistress during his marriage to the beautiful and bitter Fernanda del Carpio. When living with Petra, his livestock propagate wildly, and he indulges in unrestrained revelry. After the long rains, his fortune dries up, and the Buendías are left almost penniless. He turns to a search for a buried treasure, which nearly drives him to insanity. He dies of an unknown throat illness at the same moment as his twin. During the confusion at the funeral, the bodies are switched, and each is buried in the other&#x27;s grave (highlighting Úrsula&#x27;s earlier comment that they had been switched at birth).

Fernanda del CarpioFernanda comes from a ruined, aristocratic family that kept her isolated from the world. She was chosen as the most beautiful of 5,000 girls. She is brought to Macondo to compete with Remedios the Beauty for the title of Queen of the local carnival; however, her appearance turns the carnival into a bloody confrontation. After the fiasco, she marries Aureliano Segundo, who despite this maintains a domestic relation with his concubine, Petra Cotes. Nevertheless, she soon takes the leadership of the family away from the now frail Úrsula. She manages the Buendía affairs with an iron fist. She has three children by Aureliano Segundo: José Arcadio; Renata Remedios, a.k.a. Meme; and Amaranta Úrsula. She remains in the house after her husband dies, taking care of the household until her death.

Fernanda is never accepted by anyone in the Buendía household for they regard her as an outsider, although none of the Buendías rebel against her inflexible conservatism. Her mental and emotional instability is revealed through her paranoia, her correspondence with the &quot;invisible doctors&quot;, and her irrational behavior towards Meme&#x27;s son Aureliano, whom she tries to isolate from the world.

;Petra Cotes
Petra is a dark-skinned mulatto woman with gold-brown eyes similar to those of a panther. She is Aureliano Segundo&#x27;s mistress and the love of his life. She arrives in Macondo as a teenager with her first husband. After her husband dies, she begins a relationship with José Arcadio Segundo. When she meets Aureliano Segundo, she begins a relationship with him as well, not knowing they are two different men. After José Arcadio decides to leave her, Aureliano Segundo gets her forgiveness and remains by her side. He continues to see her, even after his marriage. He eventually lives with her, which greatly embitters his wife, Fernanda del Carpio. When Aureliano and Petra make love, their animals reproduce at an amazing rate, but their livestock is wiped out during the four years of rain. Petra makes money by keeping the lottery alive and provides food baskets for Fernanda and her family after the death of Aureliano Segundo.

===Fifth generation===
;José Arcadio
José Arcadio, named after his ancestors in the Buendía tradition, is Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda&#x27;s oldest child and follows the trend of previous Arcadios. He is raised by Úrsula, who intends for him to become Pope. After Fernanda&#x27;s death, he returns from Rome without having become a priest. He spends his days pining for Amaranta, the object of his obsession. Eventually, he discovers the treasure Úrsula had buried under her bed, which he wastes on lavish parties and escapades with adolescent boys. Later, he begins a tentative friendship with Aureliano Babilonia, his nephew. José Arcadio plans to set Aureliano up in a business and return to Rome, but is murdered in his bath by four of the adolescent boys who ransack his house and steal his gold.

;Renata Remedios (a.k.a. Meme)
Renata Remedios, or Meme, is Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda&#x27;s second child and first daughter. While she doesn&#x27;t inherit Fernanda&#x27;s beauty, she does have Aureliano Segundo&#x27;s love of life and natural charisma. After her mother declares that she is to do nothing but play the clavichord, she is sent to school where she receives her performance degree as well as academic recognition. While she pursues the clavichord with &quot;an inflexible discipline&quot; to placate Fernanda, she also enjoys partying and exhibits the same tendency towards excess as her father.

Meme meets and falls in love with Mauricio Babilonia, but when Fernanda discovers their affair, she arranges for Mauricio to be shot, claiming that he was a chicken thief. She then takes Meme to a convent. Meme remains mute for the rest of her life, partially because of the trauma, but also as a sign of rebellion. Several months after arriving at the convent, she gives birth to a son, Aureliano. He is sent to live with the Buendías. Aureliano arrives in a basket and Fernanda is tempted to kill the child in order to avoid shame, but instead claims he is an orphan in order to cover up her daughter&#x27;s promiscuity and is forced to &quot;tolerate him against her will for the rest of her life because at the moment of truth she lacked the courage to go through with her inner determination to drown him&quot;.

;Amaranta Úrsula
Amaranta Úrsula is Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda&#x27;s third child. She displays the same characteristics as her namesake who dies when she is only a child. She never knows that the child sent to the Buendía home is her nephew, the illegitimate son of Meme. He becomes her best friend in childhood. She returns home from Europe with an older husband, Gastón, who leaves her when she informs him of her passionate affair with Aureliano. She dies of a hemorrhage after she has given birth to the last of the Buendía line.

;Mauricio Babilonia
Mauricio is a brutally honest, generous and handsome mechanic for the banana company. He is said to be a descendant of the Gypsies who visit Macondo in the early days. He has the unusual characteristic of being constantly swarmed by yellow butterflies, which follow even his lover for a time. Mauricio begins a romantic affair with Meme until Fernanda discovers them and tries to end it. When Mauricio continues to sneak into the house to see her, Fernanda has him shot, claiming he is a chicken thief. Paralyzed and bedridden, he spends the rest of his long life in solitude.

;Gastón
Gastón is Amaranta Úrsula&#x27;s wealthy, Belgian husband. She marries him in Europe and returns to Macondo leading him on a silk leash. Gastón is about fifteen years older than his wife. He is an aviator and an adventurer. When he moves with Amaranta Ursula to Macondo he thinks it is only a matter of time before she realizes that her European ways are out of place, causing her to want to move back to Europe. However, when he realizes his wife intends to stay in Macondo, he arranges for his airplane to be shipped over so he can start an airmail service. The plane is shipped to Africa by mistake. When he travels there to claim it, Amaranta writes to him of her love for Aureliano Babilonia Buendía. Gastón takes the news in stride, only asking that they ship him his velocipede.

===Sixth generation===
;Aureliano Babilonia (Aureliano II)
Aureliano Babilonia, or Aureliano II, is Meme&#x27;s illegitimate child with Mauricio Babilonia. He is hidden from everyone by his grandmother, Fernanda. He is strikingly similar to his namesake, the Colonel, and has the same character patterns as well. He is taciturn, silent, and emotionally charged. He barely knows Úrsula, who dies during his childhood. He is a friend of José Arcadio Segundo, who explains to him the true story of the banana worker massacre.

While other members of the family leave and return, Aureliano stays in the Buendía home. He only ventures into the empty town after the death of Fernanda. He works to decipher the parchments of Melquíades but stops to have an affair with his childhood partner and the love of his life, Amaranta Úrsula, not knowing that she is his aunt. When both she and her child die, he is able to decipher the parchments. &quot;...Melquíades&#x27; final keys were revealed to him and he saw the epigraph of the parchments perfectly placed in the order of man&#x27;s time and space: &#x27;The first in line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants&#x27;.&quot; It is assumed he dies in the great wind that destroys Macondo the moment he finishes reading Melquíades&#x27; parchments.

With his death, the Buendía line ends.

===Seventh generation===
;Aureliano
Aureliano is the child of Aureliano and his aunt, Amaranta Úrsula. He is born with a pig&#x27;s tail, as the eldest and long dead Úrsula had always feared would happen (the parents of the child had never heard of the omen). His mother dies after giving birth to him, and, due to his grief-stricken father&#x27;s negligence, he is devoured by ants.

===Others===
;Melquíades
Melquíades is one of a band of Gypsies who visit Macondo every year in March, displaying amazing items from around the world. Melquíades sells José Arcadio Buendía several new inventions including a pair of magnets and an alchemist&#x27;s lab. Later, the Gypsies report that Melquíades died in Singapore, but he, nonetheless, returns to live with the Buendía family, stating he could not bear the solitude of death. He stays with the Buendías and begins to write the mysterious parchments, which are eventually translated by Aureliano Babilonia, and prophesy the House of Buendía&#x27;s end. Melquíades dies a second time from drowning in the river near Macondo and, following a grand ceremony organized by the Buendías, is the first individual buried in Macondo. His name echoes Melchizedek in the Old Testament, whose source of authority as a high priest was mysterious.

;Pietro Crespi
Pietro is a very handsome and polite Italian musician who runs a music school. He installs the pianola in the Buendía house. He becomes engaged to Rebeca, but Amaranta, who also loves him, manages to delay the wedding for years. When José Arcadio and Rebeca agree to be married, Pietro begins to woo Amaranta, who is so embittered that she cruelly rejects him. Despondent over the loss of both sisters, he kills himself.

;Mr. Herbert and Mr. Brown
Mr. Herbert is a gringo who shows up at the Buendía house for lunch one day. After tasting the local bananas for the first time, he arranges for a banana company to set up a plantation in Macondo. The plantation is run by the dictatorial Jack Brown. When José Arcadio Segundo helps arrange a workers&#x27; strike on the plantation, the company traps the more than three thousand strikers and machine guns them down in the town square. The banana company and the government completely cover up the event. José Arcadio is the only one who remembers the slaughter. The company arranges for the army to kill off any resistance, then leaves Macondo for good. The event is likely based on the Banana massacre that took place in Ciénaga, Magdalena in 1928.

;Colonel Gerineldo Márquez
He is the friend and comrade-in-arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. He fruitlessly woos Amaranta.

;Gabriel (Márquez)
Gabriel is only a minor character in the novel but he has the distinction of bearing almost the same name as the author. He is the great-great-grandson of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. He and Aureliano Babilonia are close friends because they know the history of the town, which no one else believes. He leaves for Paris after winning a contest and decides to stay there, selling old newspapers and empty bottles. He is one of the few who is able to leave Macondo before the town is wiped out entirely.

==Major themes==
===Subjectivity of reality and magic realism===
Critics often cite certain works by García Márquez, such as &quot;A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings&quot; and &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, as exemplary of magic realism, a style of writing in which the supernatural is presented as mundane, and the mundane as supernatural or extraordinary. The term was coined by German art critic Franz Roh in 1925.

The novel presents a fictional story in a fictional setting. The extraordinary events and characters are fabricated, yet García Márquez uses his fantastic story as an expression of reality. &quot;In &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; myth and history overlap. The myth acts as a vehicle to transmit history to the reader. García Márquez&#x27;s novel could also be referred to as anthropology, where truth is found in language and myth. The real and the fiction are indistinguishable. 

There are three main mythical elements of the novel: classical stories alluding to foundations and origins, characters resembling mythical heroes, and supernatural elements.&quot;
Magic realism is achieved by the constant intertwining of the ordinary with the extraordinary. This magic realism strikes at one&#x27;s traditional sense of naturalistic fiction. There is something clearly magical about the world of Macondo. It is a state of mind as much as, or more than, a geographical place. For example, one learns very little about its actual physical layout. Furthermore, once in it, the reader must be prepared to meet whatever the imagination of the author presents to them.

García Márquez blends the real with the magical through the use of tone and narration. By maintaining the same tone throughout the novel, García Márquez makes the extraordinary blend with the ordinary. His condensation of events and lackadaisical manner in describing them causes the extraordinary to seem less remarkable than it actually is, further blending the real with the magical. Reinforcing this effect is the unastonished tone in which the book is written. This tone restricts the ability of the reader to question the events of the novel. However, it also causes the reader to call into question the limits of reality. Furthermore, maintaining the same narrator throughout the novel familiarizes the reader with his voice and causes them to become accustomed to the extraordinary events in the novel.

Throughout the novel, García Márquez is said to have a gift for blending the everyday with the miraculous, the historical with the fabulous, and psychological realism with surreal flights of fancy. It is a revolutionary novel that provides a looking glass into the thoughts and beliefs of its author, who chose to give a literary voice to Latin America: &quot;A Latin America which neither wants, nor has any reason, to be a pawn without a will of its own; nor is it merely wishful thinking that its quest for independence and originality should become a Western aspiration.&quot;

Although we are faced with a very convoluted narrative, García Márquez is able to define clear themes while maintaining individual character identities, and using different narrative techniques such as third-person narrators, specific point of view narrators, and streams of consciousness. Cinematographic techniques are also employed in the novel, with the idea of the montage and the close-up, which effectively combine the comic and grotesque with the dramatic and tragic. Furthermore, political and historical realities are combined with the mythical and magical Latin American world. Lastly, through human comedy the problems of a family, a town, and a country are unveiled. This is all presented through García Márquez&#x27;s unique form of narration, which causes the novel to never cease being at its most interesting point.

===Solitude===

Perhaps the most dominant theme in the book is that of solitude. Macondo was founded in the remote jungles of the Colombian rainforest. The solitude of the town is representative of the colonial period in Latin American history, where outposts and colonies were, for all intents and purposes, not interconnected. Isolated from the rest of the world, the Buendías grow to be increasingly solitary and selfish. With every member of the family living only for him or her self, the Buendías become representative of the aristocratic, land-owning elite who came to dominate Latin America in keeping with the sense of Latin American history symbolized in the novel. This egocentricity is embodied, especially, in the characters of Aureliano, who lives in a private world of his own, and Remedios the Beauty, who innocently destroys the lives of four men enamored by her unbelievable beauty, because she is living in a different reality due to what some see as autism. Throughout the novel it seems as if no character can find true love or escape the destructiveness of their own egocentricity.

The selfishness of the Buendía family is eventually broken by the once superficial Aureliano Segundo and Petra Cotes, who discover a sense of mutual solidarity and the joy of helping others in need during Macondo&#x27;s economic crisis. The pair even find love, and their pattern is repeated by Aureliano Babilonia and Amaranta Úrsula. Eventually, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula have a child, and the latter is convinced that it will represent a fresh start for the once-conceited Buendía family. However, the child turns out to be the perpetually feared monster with the pig&#x27;s tail.

Nonetheless, the appearance of love represents a shift in Macondo, albeit one that leads to its destruction. &quot;The emergence of love in the novel to displace the traditional egoism of the Buendías reflects the emergence of socialist values as a political force in Latin America, a force that will sweep away the Buendías and the order they represent.&quot; The book&#x27;s ending could be a wishful prediction by García Márquez, a well-known socialist, regarding the future of Latin America.

===Fluidity of time===
The book contains several ideas concerning time. Although the story can be read as a linear progression of events, both when considering individual lives and Macondo&#x27;s history, García Márquez allows room for several other interpretations of time:
* He reiterates the metaphor of history as a circular phenomenon through the repetition of names and characteristics belonging to the Buendía family. Over six generations, all the José Arcadios possess inquisitive and rational dispositions as well as enormous physical strength. The Aurelianos, meanwhile, lean towards insularity and quietude. This repetition of traits reproduces the history of the individual characters and, ultimately, the history of the town as a succession of the same mistakes ad infinitum due to some endogenous hubris in our nature.
* The novel explores the issue of timelessness or eternity even within the framework of mortal existence. A major trope with which it accomplishes this task is the alchemist&#x27;s laboratory in the Buendía family home. The laboratory was first designed by Melquíades near the start of the story and remains essentially unchanged throughout its course. It is a place where the male Buendía characters can indulge their will to solitude, whether through attempts to deconstruct the world with reason as in the case of José Arcadio Buendía, or by the endless creation and destruction of golden fish as in the case of his son Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Furthermore, a sense of inevitability prevails throughout the text. This is a feeling that regardless of what way one looks at time, its encompassing nature is the one truthful admission.
* On the other hand, it is important to keep in mind that the book, while basically chronological and &quot;linear&quot; enough in its broad outlines, also shows abundant zigzags in time, both flashbacks of matters past and long leaps towards future events. One example of this is the youthful amour between Meme and Mauricio Babilonia, which is already in full swing before we are informed about the origins of the affair. Another example is the often-praised first line of the novel, which already established shifting perspective between the past, present, and future:
===Incest===
A recurring theme in the book is the Buendía family&#x27;s propensity towards incest. The patriarch of the family, Jose Arcadio Buendía, is the first of numerous Buendías to intermarry when he marries his first cousin, Úrsula. Furthermore, the fact that &quot;throughout the novel the family is haunted by the fear of punishment in the form of the birth of a monstrous child with a pig&#x27;s tail&quot; can be attributed to this initial act and the recurring acts of incest among the Buendías.

===Elitism===
A theme throughout the book is the elitism of the Buendía family. Gabriel García Márquez shows his criticism of the Latin American elite through the stories of the members of a high-status family who are essentially in love with themselves, to the point of being unable to understand the mistakes of their past and learn from them. The Buendía family&#x27;s literal loving of themselves through incest not only shows how elites consider themselves to be above the law, but also reveals how little they learn from their history. José Arcadio Buendía and Ursula fear that since their relationship is incestuous, their child will have animalistic features; even though theirs does not, the final child of the Buendía line, Aureliano of Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula, has the tail of a pig, and because they do not know their history, they do not know that this fear has materialized before, nor do they know that, had the child lived, removing the tail would have resulted in his death. This speaks to how elites in Latin America do not pass down history that remembers them in a negative manner. The Buendía family further cannot move beyond giving tribute to themselves in the form of naming their children the same names over and over again. &quot;José Arcadio&quot; appears four times in the family tree, &quot;Aureliano&quot; appears 22 times, &quot;Remedios&quot; appears three times and &quot;Amaranta&quot; and &quot;Ursula&quot; appear twice. The continual references to the sprawling Buendía house call to mind the idea of a Big House, or &quot;hacienda,&quot; a large land holding in which elite families lived and managed their lands and laborers. In Colombia, where the novel takes place, a Big House was known for being a grand one-story dwelling with many bedrooms, parlors, a kitchen, a pantry and a veranda, all areas of the Buendía household mentioned throughout the book. The book focuses squarely on one family in the midst of the many residents of Macondo as a representation of how the poorest of Latin American villages have been subjugated and forgotten throughout the course of Latin American history.

==Interpretation==
===Literary significance and acclaim===
The book has received universal recognition. The novel has been awarded Italy&#x27;s Chianciano Award, France&#x27;s Prix de Meilleur Livre Etranger, Venezuela&#x27;s Rómulo Gallegos Prize, and the United States&#x27; Books Abroad/Neustadt International Prize for Literature. García Márquez also received an honorary LL.D. from Columbia University in New York City. These awards set the stage for García Márquez&#x27;s 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature. The novel topped the list of books that have most shaped world literature over the last 25 years, according to a survey of international writers commissioned by the global literary journal &quot;Wasafiri&quot; as a part of its 25-anniversary celebration.

The superlatives from reviewers and readers alike display the resounding praise which the novel has received. Chilean poet and Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda called it &quot;the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since &quot;Don Quixote&quot; of Cervantes&quot;, while John Leonard in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;with a single bound, Gabriel García Márquez leaps onto the stage with Günter Grass and Vladimir Nabokov.&quot;

According to Antonio Sacoto, professor at the City College of the City University of New York, the book is considered one of the five key novels in Hispanic American literature (together with &quot;El Señor Presidente&quot;, &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot;, &quot;La Muerte de Artemio Cruz&quot;, and &quot;La ciudad y los perros&quot;). These novels are often considered representative of the boom that allowed Hispanic American literature to reach the quality of North American and European literature in terms of technical quality, rich themes, and linguistic innovations, among other attributes.

In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, García Márquez addressed the significance of his writing and proposed its role to be more than just literary expression:

Harold Bloom remarked, &quot;My primary impression, in the act of rereading &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, is a kind of aesthetic battle fatigue, since every page is rammed full of life beyond the capacity of any single reader to absorb... There are no wasted sentences, no mere transitions, in this novel, and you must notice everything at the moment you read it.&quot; David Haberly has argued that García Márquez may have borrowed themes from several works, such as William Faulkner&#x27;s Yoknapatawpha County, Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Defoe&#x27;s &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot;, and Chateaubriand&#x27;s &quot;Atala&quot;, in an example of intertextuality.

In 2017, Chilean artist Luisa Rivera illustrated a fiftieth anniversary special edition of the book published by Penguin Random House Group Editorial, Spain.

=== Relation to Colombian history ===
As a metaphoric, critical interpretation of Colombian history, from foundation to contemporary nation, the book presents different national myths through the story of the Buendía family, whose spirit of adventure places them amidst the important actions of Colombian historical events. These events include the inclusion of the Roma &quot;Gypsies&quot;, the Liberal political reformation of a colonial way of life, and the 19th-century arguments for and against it; the arrival of the railway to a mountainous country; the Thousand Days&#x27; War (Guerra de los Mil Días, 1899–1902); the corporate hegemony of the United Fruit Company (&quot;American Fruit Company&quot; in the story); the cinema; the automobile; and the military massacre of striking workers as government–labour relations policy.

==== Inclusion of the Roma (&quot;Gypsies&quot;) ====
According to Hazel Marsh, a Senior Lecturer in Latin American Studies at the University of East Anglia, it is estimated that 8,000 Roma live in Colombia today. However, &quot;most South American history books...exclude the presence of the Roma.&quot; &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; differs from this tendency by including the traveling Roma throughout the story. Led by a man named Melquíades, the Roma bring new discoveries and technology to the isolated village of Macondo, often inciting the curiosity of José Arcadio Buendía.

==== Depiction of the Thousand Days War ====
The Thousand Days War in Colombia was fought between Liberals and Conservatives from 1899 to 1902. The Conservatives had been &quot;in control more or less constantly since 1867,&quot; and the Liberals, mainly coffee plantation owners and workers who had been excluded from representation, sparked a revolution in October 1899. The fighting continued for a few years, and it is estimated that over 130,000 people died.

In Chapters 5 and 6, the Conservative Army has invaded the town of Macondo leading Aureliano to eventually lead a rebellion. The rebellion is successful - the Conservative Army falls - and afterward, Aureliano, now &#x27;Colonel Aureliano Buendía&#x27; decides to continue fighting. He departs Macondo with the band of people who helped him oust the Conservative Army to go continue fighting elsewhere for the Liberal side.

Because Macondo is a fictional town created by Gabriel García Márquez, the exact events of the Thousand Days&#x27; War as they occurred in the book are fictional. However, these events are widely considered to be metaphorical for the Thousand Days War as experienced by the entire country of Colombia.

==== Representation of the &quot;Banana Massacre&quot; ====
The &quot;Banana Massacre&quot; occurred December 5-6, 1928, in Ciénaga near Santa Marta, Colombia. Banana plantation workers had been striking against the United Fruit Company to earn better labor conditions when members of the local military fired guns into crowds.

This event, which occurs in Chapter 15, was depicted with relative accuracy, minus a false sense of certainty about the specific facts surrounding the events. For instance, although Garcia Márquez writes that there must have been &quot;three thousand...dead,&quot; the true number of victims is unknown. However, the number likely was not far off, because it is considered that the &quot;number of killings was over a thousand,&quot; according to Dr. Jorge Enrique Elias Caro and Dr. Antonino Vidal Ortega. The lack of information surrounding the &quot;Banana Massacre&quot; is thought to be largely due to the &quot;manipulation of the information as registered by the Colombian Government and the United Fruit Company.&quot;

==Internal references==
In the novel&#x27;s account of the civil war and subsequent peace, there are numerous mentions of the pensions not arriving for the veterans, a reference to one of García Márquez&#x27;s earlier works, &quot;El coronel no tiene quien le escriba&quot;. In the novel&#x27;s final chapter, García Márquez refers to the novel &quot;Hopscotch&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Rayuela&quot;) by Julio Cortázar in the following line: &quot;...in the room that smelled of boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die&quot; (p. 412). Rocamadour is a fictional character in &quot;Hopscotch&quot; who indeed dies in the room described. He also refers to two other major works by Latin American writers in the novel: &quot;The Death of Artemio Cruz&quot; (Spanish: &quot;La Muerte de Artemio Cruz&quot;) by Carlos Fuentes and &quot;Explosion in a Cathedral&quot; (Spanish: &quot;El siglo de las luces&quot;) by Alejo Carpentier.

==Adaptations==
Shūji Terayama&#x27;s play &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; (百年の孤独, originally performed by the Tenjō Sajiki theater troupe) and his film &quot;Farewell to the Ark&quot; (さらば箱舟) are loose (and unauthorized) adaptations of the novel transplanted into the realm of Japanese culture and history.

Television series
On March 6, 2019, García Márquez&#x27;s son Rodrigo García Barcha announced that Netflix was adapting the book into a TV series.

On October 21, 2022, Netflix commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the announcement of García Márquez&#x27;s Nobel Prize in Literature with an exclusive preview of &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;.

On the tenth anniversary of García Márquez&#x27;s death, Netflix released the official teaser for &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; and revealed that the series will run for sixteen episodes. The cast includes Claudio Cataño (Colonel Aureliano Buendía), Jerónimo Barón (young Aureliano Buendía), Marco González (Jose Arcadio Buendía), Leonardo Soto (José Arcadio), Susana Morales (Úrsula Iguarán), Ella Becerra (Petronila Iguarán), Carlos Suaréz (Aureliano Iguarán), Moreno Borja (Melquiades), and Santiago Vásquez (teenage Aureliano Buendía).

The book is considered by fans to be García Márquez&#x27;s masterpiece yet he himself refused to sell the screening rights to his novel because he did not want it to be adapted in any language other than Spanish and felt a film adaptation would not cover the entire plot due to its length. For its TV adaptation, Netflix worked with Rodrigo and Gonzalo García who served as the show&#x27;s executive producers. The episodes were all shot in the late writer&#x27;s native Colombia and directed by Alex García Lopez, and all the characters&#x27; lines are spoken in Spanish. Barbara Enriquez, who had previously worked on Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Roma&quot;, served as the show&#x27;s production designer. The TV series is Netflix&#x27;s most expensive Latin American-made project to date, with Colombian groups and indigenous communities making and providing props, and a total of four hundred fifty locals building three different versions of Macondo for the progression of the series.

In García Márquez&#x27;s birthplace of Aracataca, the locals were disappointed that the TV series was not shot there, yet they still hope that it will draw people in.

The series premiered on December 11, 2024.

<text>Maglemosian ( 9000 –  6000 BC) is the name given to a culture of the early Mesolithic period in Northern Europe. In Scandinavia, the culture was succeeded by the Kongemose culture.

==Environment and location==
The name originates from the Danish archeological site &quot;Maglemose&quot;, situated near Gørlev and Høng on western Zealand, southwest of lake Tissø. Here the first settlement of the culture was excavated in 1900, by George Sarauw. During the following century a long series of similar settlements were excavated from England to Poland and from Skåne in Sweden to northern France.

When the Maglemosian culture flourished, sea levels were much lower than now and what is now mainland Europe and Scandinavia were linked with Britain. The cultural period overlaps the end of the last ice age, when the ice retreated and the glaciers melted. It was a long process and sea levels in Northern Europe did not reach current levels until almost 6000 BC, by which time they had inundated large territories previously inhabited by Maglemosian people. Therefore, there is hope that the emerging discipline of underwater archaeology may reveal interesting findings related to the Maglemosian culture in the future.

==Characteristics==
The Maglemosian people lived in forest and wetland environments, using fishing and hunting tools made from wood, bone, and flint microliths. It appears that they had domesticated the dog. Some may have lived settled lives, but most were nomadic.

Huts made of bark have been preserved, in addition to tools made of flint, bone, and horn. A characteristic feature of the culture is the sharply edged microliths of flintstone, used for spear and arrow heads. Another notable feature is the leister, a characteristic type of fishing spear, used for gigging.

<doc id="654709" wikidata="Q205015" url="?curid=654709" title="Lophius piscatorius">
<text>Lophius piscatorius, commonly known as the anglerfish, frog fish, fishing frog, monk, European angler, common monkfish, sea devil, or devil fish, is a monkfish in the family Lophiidae. It is found in coastal waters of the northeast Atlantic, from the Barents Sea to the Strait of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Within some of its range, including the Irish Sea, this species comprises a significant commercial fishery.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Lophius piscatorius&quot; was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; given as &quot;in Oceano Europæo&quot;, meaning the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean and Black Seas with localities mentioned including Bordeaux, Marseille and Montpellier in France; Genoa, Rome, Naples and Venice in Italy; Lesbos in Greece; and Syria. When Linnaeus described this species he created a new genus, &quot;Lophius&quot;. In 1883, David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert designated this species as the type species of that genus. The genus &quot;Lophius&quot; is one of four extant genera in the family Lophiidae, which the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; classifies in the monotypic suborder Lophioidei within the order Lophiiformes.

==Etymology==
&quot;Lophius piscatorius&quot; has the genus name &quot;Lophius&quot; which means &quot;mane&quot; and is presumably a reference to the first three spines of the first dorsal fin which are tentacle like, with three smaller spines behind them. The specific name &quot;piscatorius&quot;, this means &quot;of fishing&quot;, this is a reference to the first dorsal spine being modified into a &quot;fishing rod&quot;, called the illicium tipped with a lure, the esca, which is used to attract prey within reach of the huge mouth.

==Description==
The average size of European anglers is , with larger specimens exceeding this range. Precise ranges in body size tend to vary between different localities and populations. Average size also tends to increase with depth; populations living in deeper waters are larger-bodied overall than shallow-water ones.

It has a very large head which is broad, flat, and depressed; the rest of the body appears to be a mere appendage. The wide mouth extends all the way around the anterior circumference of the head, and both jaws are armed with bands of long, pointed teeth. These are inclined inwards and can be closed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but to prevent its escape from the mouth.

The pectoral and pelvic fins are articulated as to perform the functions of feet, so the fish is able to walk along the bottom of the sea, where it generally hides in the sand or amongst seaweed. Around its head and also along the body, the skin bears fringed appendages resembling short fronds of seaweed, a structure which, combined with the ability to match the colour of the body to its surroundings, assists this fish in camouflaging itself in the places which it selects on account of the abundance of prey. It has no scales.

The ovaries of female anglers take the form of two long, ribbon-like lobes connected at their posterior ends. One side consists of an egg-producing layer, while the other produces a gelatinous secretion that fills the ovarian lumen during egg maturation. During the reproductive season, the ovaries swell until they fill the abdominal cavity. Male testes are elongated and bean-shaped in cross-section. Spermatogenesis begins in sac-like cysts and is completed in the lumina.

==Habitat==
The European angler inhabits muddy and sandy bottoms up to depths of . It is occasionally found on rocky bottoms as well. They rarely occur below the continental slope.

==Behaviour==
===Feeding===

The fish has long filaments along the middle of its head, which are, in fact, the detached and modified three first spines of the anterior dorsal fin. The filament most important to the angler is the first, which is the longest, terminates in a lappet, and is movable in every direction. The angler is believed to attract other fish by means of its lure, and then to seize them with its enormous jaws. While it is considered probable that smaller fish are attracted in this way experiments have shown that the actions of the jaw is automatic and depends on the contact of the prey with the tentacle. Its stomach is expandable and it is not unheard of for these fish to swallow prey of their own size.

Adult anglers feed primarily on fish, while juveniles prey mainly on marine invertebrates. Norway pout is the most common prey item in Northern European waters, while blue whiting is more common among southern population. Whiting and Norway lobster are among the main prey of adult anglers in the Irish Sea. Lesser sandeel is a seasonally common prey item around the Shetland Islands. Cephalopods are an important food source in the Cantabrian Sea. In 1940, an angler was discovered with a herring gull in its stomach, and it is known to surface and attempt to capture waterbirds.

===Breeding and lifecycle===
The spawn of the angler consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material wide and long drifting freely in the water. The eggs in this sheet are in a single layer, each in its own little cavity. The larvae are free-swimming and their pelvic fins are elongated into filaments. As many as 300,000 to 2,800,000 eggs may be released in a single spawning. The egg sheets are buoyant and float near the surface of the water, where the action of wind and surface currents may aid dispersal.

A male angler matures at the age of four years and grows to be long; whereas the female angler takes two years longer to mature.

The primary spawning season is distributed between February and June, peaking in spring. A secondary spawning season occurs in November and December, although with a lower percentage of actively reproducing individuals than observed in the primary season.

==Relationship with humans==

&quot;Lophius piscatorius&quot; has historically been considered valuable bycatch in Atlantic fisheries. Captures increased significantly following the development of improvements in deep-water fishing technology. The species has been an important fishery resource in Iberian waters since the 1980s. The related species &quot;Lophius budegassa&quot; is often caught alongside it, but &quot;L. piscatorius&quot; is the more abundant of the two.

<text>Minister of the Crown is a formal constitutional term used in Commonwealth realms to describe a minister of the reigning sovereign or viceroy. The term indicates that the minister serves at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure, and advises the sovereign or viceroy on how to exercise the Crown prerogatives relating to the minister&#x27;s department or ministry.

==Ministries==
In Commonwealth realms, the sovereign or viceroy is formally advised by a larger body known as a privy council or executive council, though, in practice, they are advised by a subset of such councils: the collective body of ministers of the Crown called the ministry. The ministry should not be confused with the cabinet, as ministers of the Crown may be outside a cabinet. In the UK, ministers are the MPs and members of the British House of Commons or House of Lords who are in the government.

==History==
Ministers of the Crown in Commonwealth realms have their roots in early modern England, where monarchs sometimes employed cabinet councils consisting of ministers to advise the monarch and implemented his decisions. The term &quot;Minister&quot; came into being as the sovereign&#x27;s advisors &quot;ministered to&quot;, or served, the king. Over time, former ministers and other distinguished persons were retained as peripheral advisers with designated ministers having the direct ear of the king. This led to the creation of the larger Privy Council, with the Cabinet becoming a committee within that body, made up of currently serving ministers, who also were heads of departments.

During a period between the accession of King James VI of Scotland to the throne of England in 1603 and the unification of Scotland and England in 1707, the two entities were separate kingdoms in personal union through the one monarch who was advised by a separate set of ministers of the Crown for each country. 

As the English overseas possessions and later British Empire expanded, the colonial governments remained subordinate to the imperial government at Westminster, and thus the Crown was still ministered to only by the Imperial Privy Council, made up of British ministers of the Crown. When Canada became a Dominion in 1867, however, a separate Canadian Privy Council was established to advise the Canadian governor general on the exercise of the Crown prerogative in Canada, although constitutionally the viceroy remained an agent of the British government at Whitehall. After that date, other colonies of the empire attained Dominion status and similar arrangements were made. 

Following the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, however, the Dominions became effectively autonomous realms under one sovereign, thus returning the monarch to a position similar to that which existed pre-1707, where he or she was ministered to by a separate ministry for each realm. Thus, today, no minister of the Crown in any Commonwealth realm can advise the monarch to exercise any powers pertaining to any of the other Dominions.

==Uses in other countries==

In Spain, during the &quot;Restauración&quot; period (1874–1931) the term Minister of the Crown () was used for a person who was in charge of a ministerial department of His Majesty&#x27;s Government (). For example, during the reign of King Alfonso XIII, when Carlos María Cortezo y Prieto de Orche was appointed as &quot;Ministro de Instrucción Pública y Bellas Artes&quot; (Minister for Public Instruction of Fine Arts), in the royal decree it was noted that he was a minister of the Crown.

Nowadays, the most formal way to address a minister is as &quot;Minister of the Government&quot;.

<doc id="654716" wikidata="Q168343" url="?curid=654716" title="Federal Convention (Germany)">
<text>The Federal Convention, also known as the Federal Assembly (), is, together with the Joint Committee, one of two non-permanent constitutional bodies in the institutional framework of the Federal Republic of Germany. It is convened solely for the purpose of electing the President of Germany. The Federal Convention consists of all members of the federal parliament (Bundestag) and the same number of delegates from the 16 federated states. Those delegates are elected by the state parliaments for this purpose only.

==Convening the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot;==
Each Federal Convention is convened by the incumbent president of the Bundestag in due course. Normally, this takes place during the last months of a sitting president&#x27;s current term of office. The Convention must meet no later than thirty days before the end of the term, with the state parliaments needing sufficient time between the convening and the meeting to elect state delegates.

If the term of office of a president ends prematurely through resignation, death or impeachment, the Federal Convention must meet within thirty days. This has happened three times so far (1969, 2010 and 2012); in 2010 and 2012, the president of the Bundestag convened the Assembly at the latest possible date. Heinrich Lübke&#x27;s resignation (1968/69) is a special case: he announced in October 1968 that he would resign with effect from June 30, 1969, in order to enable the Federal Convention to be held before the start of the Bundestag election campaign in the fall of that year. Since the resignation was announced about nine months in advance, the Federal Convention could be held as usual before the (early) end of his term of office.

==Procedure==
According to the &quot;Grundgesetz&quot;, the president is elected without a debate at the Federal Convention. The candidates are usually nominated by one or more parties but do not generally run a campaign. Each member of the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; may suggest candidates for the office of the Federal President. This means that not only parliamentary groups from the Bundestag can present a candidate but also small parties which may not be represented in the Bundestag. The &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; is chaired by the president of the Bundestag (or one of the vice presidents, if the president stands as a candidate – as was the case with Karl Carstens in 1979).

The procedure of the election of the &quot;Bundespräsident&quot; consists of a maximum of three secret votes by written ballot. If one of the first two votes ends with an absolute majority for one of the candidates, this candidate is elected immediately. If the first two votes do not lead to an absolute majority, a plurality is sufficient on the third and final vote. The president of the Bundestag closes the session of the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; immediately, after the result is declared. Thus, the convention is irrevocably dissolved until it is reconvened for the next election. This means that even if the elected president does not accept the election, the convention cannot simply reconvene; rather, the president of the Bundestag has to convene a new convention, for which the state parliaments have to elect fresh delegates.

Normally, the new president takes office thirty days after the election at the earliest, as the term of office of the predecessor is still continuing. Only in the case of a vacancy (e.g. after the resignation of the predecessor, as happened in 2010 and 2012), the elected person takes office immediately upon acceptance of the election. Irrespective of this, a newly elected president does not take the oath of office before the Federal Convention, but after taking office in a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.

==Membership==
The &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; includes the entire membership of the &quot;Bundestag&quot;, and an equal number of state delegates elected by the state or &#x27;Länder&#x27; parliaments specifically for this purpose, proportional to their population. 

According to federal law, every member of a state parliament has one vote. The delegates are elected with lists and proportional vote. Some details are dealt with by the standing orders of the state parliament. In many state parliaments, the members vote on a joint list that mirrors the strengths of the parliamentary groups.

A delegate for the Federal Convention must meet one certain standard: they must also be eligible for a candidacy for the Bundestag. The parliamentary groups sometimes elect delegates who are not politicians. For example, they choose artists, sports persons or other celebrities, or occasionally an ordinary citizen with an unusual story. Examples from 2017 are Jogi Löw, the coach of the national football team, for the Green Party in Baden-Württemberg and Olivia Jones, Germany&#x27;s most famous drag queen, for the Green Party in Lower Saxony. Semiya Şimşek, daughter of a NSU terror victim, was elected by Die Linke in Thuringia.

The idea behind this custom is to have the president be elected not only by politicians but by a broader segment of the population. Also, the political parties like to be associated with the celebrities. They expect these non-politicians to vote within party lines. The voting in the Federal Convention is secret. From the time of their nomination until the closing of the session of the Federal Convention its members enjoy parliamentary immunity with regard to prosecution by public authorities in very much the same way as members of the Bundestag do.

==History==

Since 1979, the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; has traditionally met on 23 May, the anniversary of the Basic Law (1949). This has changed since the resignations of presidents Horst Koehler and Christian Wulff.

The most recent assembly of the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; was held on 13 February 2022, where Frank-Walter Steinmeier was re-elected.

===Venue===
On 12 September 1949, the first &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; met in Bonn, which served as the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany before reunification with East Germany. From 1954 to 1969 the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; was convened at the Ostpreußenhalle in Berlin, leading to protests from the German Democratic Republic on each occasion it met. As a consequence, on 5 March 1969, the Soviet Union sent MiG-21 warplanes to fly over the venue in West Berlin. From 1974 to 1989, the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; met in the Beethovenhalle in Bonn. Since 1994, the meeting place has been the Reichstag building in Berlin. After the renovation of the Reichstag, the German &quot;Bundestag&quot; moved to the building in April 1999. Since the meeting of the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; held in May 1999, the body has convened in the plenary chamber at the Reichstag building, except that the 2022 &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; took place at the Paul-Löbe-Haus in Berlin, with delegates spread over several floors, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>John Baptist Ashe (1748November 27, 1802) was an American politician and military officer from Halifax, North Carolina.

==Biography==
He was born in the Rocky Point District of the Province of North Carolina in 1748. He was the son of Samuel Ashe and Mary Porter Ashe (cousin to her husband and first wife). His father&#x27;s residence was called the Neck and was on the northeast Cape Fear River. His father was to be governor of the state and also brother of North Carolina militia General John Ashe. He dropped the &quot;a&quot; from his middle name and was known as John Baptist Ashe.

He owned at least 63 slaves as of the 1790 census.

===Military service===
He served as a lieutenant in the Province of North Carolina New Hanover County militia during the time of the Regulator uprising in 1771. Later, during the American Revolutionary War, he served as a minuteman in the Salisbury District, and the 6th North Carolina Regiment of the North Carolina Line (Continental Army), leading the &quot;Majors&quot; company. He fought at the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge on February 27, 1776, after which the minutemen battalions were disbanded in favor of local militia and the Continental Army. He joined the 6th North Carolina Regiment as a captain and later promoted to major and then lieutenant colonel. He was at Valley Forge and fought at the Battle of Brandywine Creek in Pennsylvania on September 11, 1777; Battle of Germantown in Pennsylvania on October 4, 1777; and Battle of Monmouth in New Jersey on June 28, 1778.

===Political career===
He served in the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses in 1775. Ashe was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons (17841786) and served as Speaker of that body in 1786. He was a delegate to the Congress of the Confederation in 1787. In 1789, Ashe was a delegate and Chairman of the Committee of the whole of the Fayetteville Convention that ratified the Constitution of the United States. That same year, he served in the North Carolina Senate.

Ashe was elected to the 1st United States Congress and the 2nd United States Congress as an &quot;Anti-Administration&quot; (what became Anti-Federalist or Democratic-Republican) candidate, serving from 1790 to 1793. He was a candidate in the 1792 North Carolina gubernatorial election, finishing 3rd. Prior to his successful election as governor in 1802, he was also a candidate for governor in 1800 and 1801.

In 1802, the North Carolina General Assembly elected Ashe Governor, but he died before he could take office. He is buried in Halifax.

===Family===
On October 7, 1779, he married Elizabeth Montfort. They lived on the outskirts of Halifax, North Carolina. They had one child, Samuel Porter Ashe, born on July 17, 1791.

His namesake and nephew, John Baptista Ashe, served in Congress as a Representative from Tennessee.

<text>Heiner Müller (; 9 January 1929 – 30 December 1995) was a German (formerly East German) dramatist, poet, writer, essayist and theatre director. His &quot;enigmatic, fragmentary pieces&quot; are a significant contribution to postmodern drama and postdramatic theatre.

==Biography==
Müller was born in Eppendorf, Saxony. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 1946 which was in the course of the forced merger of the KPD and SPD subsumed into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED). He was soon expelled for lacking enthusiasm and failing to pay dues. In 1954 he became member of the German Writers&#x27; Association (Deutscher Schriftstellerverband). Müller became one of the most important dramatists of the German Democratic Republic and won the Heinrich Mann Prize in 1959 and the Kleist Prize in 1990.

His relationship with the East German state began to deteriorate, however, with his drama &#x27; (&quot;The Resettler Woman&quot;) which was censored in 1961 after only one performance. Müller was expelled from the Writers&#x27; Association in the same year. The East German government remained wary of Müller in subsequent years, preventing the premiere of &quot;Der Bau&quot; (&quot;Construction Site&quot;) in 1965 and censoring his &#x27; in the early 1970s. Yet despite these hardships, Müller&#x27;s work began to gain popularity both in West Germany and internationally at this time. Many of his best-known plays from this period were premiered in the West: this includes &quot;Germania Death in Berlin&quot;, which was first performed in 1978 at the Munich Kammerspiele. Heiner Müller himself directed a production of &quot;The Mission&quot; (&quot;Der Auftrag&quot;) in Bochum in 1982. In Paris, directed the world premiere of &quot;Die Hamletmaschine&quot; (&quot;The Hamletmachine&quot;) in 1979. English translations, first by Helen Fehervary and Marc Silberman, then by Carl Weber, introduced Müller to the English speaking world in the mid- and late 1970s; Müller&#x27;s controversial play &quot;Mauser&quot; was first performed in 1975 in Austin, Texas.

On 17 November 1976, Müller signed together with eleven other writers and artists the petition against the expatriation of Wolf Biermann. Like several others of the signatories, Müller withdrew his signature on 25 November, according to Biermann on the condition that the Stasi would keep it secret.

Due to his growing worldwide fame, Müller was able to regain acceptance in East Germany. He was admitted to the DDR Academy of Arts, Berlin in 1984 – only two years before he became a member of parallel West Berlin academy. Despite earlier honors, Müller was not readmitted to the East German Writers&#x27; Association until 1988, shortly before the end of the GDR. After the fall of the Wall, Müller became final president of the DDR Academy of the Arts from 1990 until its 1993 merger with the western academy.

In 1993 it was alleged that Müller worked from 1979 to 1990 as unofficial collaborator (an informant) under the code name &quot;Heiner&quot; for the East-German Stasi. Müller, who at the time was not a member of the East German Communist Party or the East German Deutscher Schriftstellerverband, admitted that he had contact with Stasi officials, but never provided any material.

In 1992, he was invited to join the directorate of the Berliner Ensemble, Brecht&#x27;s former company at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm, as one of its five members along with Peter Zadek, Peter Palitzsch, and . In 1995, shortly before his death, Müller was appointed as the theatre&#x27;s sole artistic director.
During the last five years of his life, Müller continued to live in Berlin and work all over Germany and Europe, mostly directing productions of his own works. He wrote few new dramatic texts in this time, though, like Brecht, he did produce much poetry in his final years. In the last half-decade of his life, Müller also worked towards transforming the interview into a literary genre.

Among his better known works, other than those already mentioned, are &quot;Der Lohndrücker&quot; (&quot;The Scab&quot;), &quot;Wolokolamsker Chaussee&quot; (&quot;Volokolamsk Highway&quot;) Parts I–V, &quot;Verkommenes Ufer Medeamaterial Landschaft mit Argonauten&quot; (&quot;Despoiled Shore Medea Material Landscape with Argonauts&quot;), &quot;Philoktet&quot; (&quot;Philoctetes&quot;), &quot;Zement&quot; (&quot;Cement&quot;), &quot;Bildbeschreibung&quot; (&quot;Description of a Picture&quot; aka &quot;Explosion of a memory&quot;) and &quot;Quartett&quot;.

In 1994, he was awarded the IV Europe Theatre Prize.

Müller died of throat cancer at the age of 66 in a hospital in Berlin on December 30, 1995. He is buried at Berlin&#x27;s Dorotheenstadt Cemetery. Müller&#x27;s grave was designed by his last stage designer Mark Lammert.

==Legacy==
Over a decade after his death, Müller continues to have an enormous influence on European playwriting, dramaturgy, and performance. In 1998, the journal New German Critique devoted a special issue to his work. He is the only playwright to have ever received such an honor. In 2009, one of Europe’s leading intellectual publishing houses, Suhrkamp, issued the final three volumes in a twelve-volume edition of Müller&#x27;s collected works.

Müller has also paved the way for a new generation of directors, playwrights, and dramaturgs who regard themselves as &quot;samplers&quot;. Müller adopted Brecht&#x27;s notion of &quot;Kopien&quot; (German for &quot;copying&quot;), the practice of regarding texts by others as material to be used, imitated, and rewritten. In regards to Brecht&#x27;s own oeuvre, Müller stated &quot;To use Brecht without criticizing him is treason.&quot; For Müller, the work of other writers and artists was not seen as private property; it was to be used as raw material for his own work. Thus, Müller&#x27;s work in the theater marks the beginning of a tradition of densely poetic dramaturgy based in the logic of association, rather than linear &quot;dramatic&quot; narrative.

Jonathan Kalb, theater critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, describes Müller&#x27;s legacy on theatre as replacing the &quot;closed&quot; didactical form of the Brechtian parable with &quot;open&quot; dramatic forms offering multiple meanings based, in Hans-Thies Lehmann&#x27;s words, on a surreal &quot;montage dramaturg ... in which the reality-level of characters and events vacillates hazily between life and dream and the stage becomes a hotbed of spirits and quotes outside any homogeneous notion of space and time.&quot; In reference to Müller, Tony Kushner declared, &quot;Write into the void, learn to embrace isolation, in which we may commence undistractedly our dreadful but all-important dialogue with the dead. Forget about love and turn your face to history.&quot; With Müller&#x27;s work, theater is a forum for examining history; it is &quot;a dialogue with the dead&quot;.

=== Musical settings ===
Heiner Müller&#x27;s texts have been set by composers on various occasions. One composer with a particularly strong relationship to his output is Heiner Goebbels, who has collaborated with him directly. Goebbels&#x27; Müller settings include the radio plays &quot;Despoiled Shore&quot; (&quot;Verkommenes Ufer&quot;, 1984), &quot;The Liberation of Prometheus&quot; (&quot;Die Befreiung des Prometheus&quot;, 1985), &quot;Volokolamsk Highway&quot; (&quot;Wolokolamsker Chausse&quot;, 1989/90) and &quot;The Man in the Elevator&quot; (&quot;Der Mann im Fahrstuhl&quot;, 1988).

In terms of plays turned into operas, Wolfgang Rihm created his version of &quot;Die Hamletmaschine in&quot; 1987, Pascal Dusapin composed a &quot;Medeamaterial&quot; (fr) in 1992, and Luca Francesconi&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Quartett&quot; (de) was premiered in 2011.

The Slovenian industrial music group Laibach also collaborated with Müller in his lifetime, and released an album based on in his texts under the name &quot;Wir sind das Volk&quot; in 2022.

<text>Susan Flannery (born July 31, 1939) is an American actress and director. She made her screen debut appearing in the 1965 Western film &quot;Guns of Diablo&quot; and later appeared in some television series. From 1966 to 1975, Flannery starred as Laura Horton on the NBC daytime soap opera, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; for which she received her first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.

Flannery received Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress for her performance in the 1974 disaster film, &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;. For her starring role in the 1976 miniseries &quot;The Moneychangers&quot;, she received Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series. Flannery later acted on prime-time shows and made-for-television movies, before returning to daytime with the role of Stephanie Forrester on the CBS soap opera, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (1987–2012, 2018), receiving three Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2000, 2002 and 2003.

==Early life==
Flannery was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, on July 31, 1939, and attended school in Manhattan. She received her BA degree from Stephens College, a women&#x27;s college in Columbia, Missouri, in 1962.

==Career== 

Flannery made her television debut appearing in an episode of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; in 1963. The following year she made her big screen debut playing a supporting role in the Western film &quot;Guns of Diablo&quot;. She made guest appearances on prime time dramas &quot;Slattery&#x27;s People&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;The Felony Squad&quot; and most notable three-episode act on &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;. In 1966, Flannery was cast as Dr. Laura Spencer Horton on the NBC daytime soap opera, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, where she met writer William J. Bell (who later cast her in &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in 1987). She played the role until 1975, winning her first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her final year on the soap.

In 1974, Flannery starred in the disaster film &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; directed by John Guillermin and starring Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, and earned around $203.3 million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1974. For her performance, Flannery won Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress. The following year, she starred in the comedy film &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot;. Also that year, Flannery starred alongside Kirk Douglas, Joan Collins and Christopher Plummer in the NBC miniseries, &quot;The Moneychangers&quot;. For this role, she received Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series. She starred in an episode &quot;A Nightmare for a Nightingale&quot; of British anthology series &quot;Thriller&quot; in 1976 and was lead actress in the 1979 miniseries &quot;Women in White&quot; based on novel by Frank G. Slaughter. Also in 1979 she played the leading role in the made-for-television romantic drama, &quot;Anatomy of a Seduction&quot;. In 1981, Flannery joined the cast of CBS prime time soap opera, &quot;Dallas&quot;, playing Leslie Stewart appearing in 11 episodes during the fourth season. She later appeared in the made-for-television movies &quot;Money on the Side&quot; (1982) and &quot;Shaft of Love&quot; (1983).

Flannery became best known worldwide for portraying Stephanie Douglas Forrester on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (1987–2012). She was one of the original cast members of the series, only two of whom still appear (Katherine Kelly Lang and John McCook). She received nine Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series nominations winning in 2000, 2002, and 2003. Flannery was also a regular director on the show and was twice nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award for her work. After 25 years, she decided to leave the show in 2012. In her final storyline, Stephanie Forrester died from lung cancer. Flannery came in at #1 in the Top 50 Soap Actresses of All Time poll on the internet blog We Love Soaps in 2010. Flannery took an active role in the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), and advocated for securing cable rights and foreign residuals for actors when their work appears in other media. Her efforts have had a positive impact on how &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; actors (and other soap actors) are paid when the show is televised in countries outside the United States.

Flannery appeared in two episodes of ABC&#x27;s situation comedy &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot; in 2004 with other well-known actors from rival soaps. Flannery also appeared as a special guest on &quot;Good News Week&quot;. She appeared in a special episode of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; with Deidre Hall (Marlena, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;) and Peter Bergman (Jack, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;) in 2006. Flannery also directed the October 13, 2008, episode of &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. From 2010 to 2014 she directed 36 episodes of &quot;&quot; and in 2017 directed an episode of &quot;The Fosters&quot;.

==Personal life==
Flannery has an adopted daughter, Blaise. 

Gay rights activist Rita Mae Brown socialized with Flannery in Los Angeles in the mid-1970s. They met through their mutual friend writer and performer Fannie Flagg, with whom Flannery had a multi-year relationship. Brown wrote the following about Flannery in her 1997 memoir &quot;Rita Will&quot;:She&#x27;d been a star in a long-running TV program and had left to take a prominent role in a film. Almost white-blonde, with a heart-shaped face, blue eyes, and a great figure, she appeared every inch a woman ready to become a major movie star. She had looks, talent, and drive. What she lacked was the ability to kiss her ass. Just when her career should have rocketed, it began to drop to Earth. Approaching forty added to the tension.

She is a fundamentally honest person, a decent one.

Word got about [directors and screenwriters] that she was difficult. That was amended to &quot;difficult dyke.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t too long before she languished in her beautiful shared Montecito, California home wondering what the hell had happened.

Were Susan at the same career fulcrum today [in 1996], she&#x27;d have a fifty-fifty chance of swinging up. In the mid-seventies, she had no chance. Today she&#x27;s back on television [in supporting roles and character parts].

Because she didn&#x27;t marry to play the game, she might as well have announced that she was gay. Other people announced it for her. She kept silent but stiff-armed any attempts to create a bogus heterosexual life. She and Fannie [Flagg] had been together for eight years. The cracks in their relationship widened under the pressure. Many of Susan and Fannie&#x27;s friends knew they were lovers, but many didn&#x27;t. The isolation, under the circumstances, had to have been extremely painful for Susan.

My heart went out to her. After my initial visit [to their Montecito home], the three of us palled around together. The more I knew Susan, the more I liked her.

If there had been a way for the three of us to live together, I would have tried it because I grew to respect Susan and value her for the generous and kind person she is. Like her Irish forebears, she engaged her crisis with good humor and the hope that she&#x27;d learn something.

<text>Marvel 1602, or simply 1602, is an eight-issue comic book limited series published in 2003 by Marvel Comics. The limited series was written by Neil Gaiman, penciled by Andy Kubert, and digitally painted by Richard Isanove; Scott McKowen illustrated the distinctive scratchboard covers. The eight-part series takes place in a timeline where Marvel superheroes exist in the Elizabethan era; faced with the destruction of their world by a mysterious force, the heroes must fight to save their universe. Many of the early Marvel superheroes—Nick Fury, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man—as well as villains such as Doctor Doom and Magneto appear in various roles.

Neil Gaiman had always been a fan of Marvel, and editor Joe Quesada approached Gaiman to work on a project which eventually evolved into &quot;1602&quot;. The success of the comic led to three sequels, entitled &quot;1602: New World&quot;, &quot;Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Man: 1602&quot;. There is also a short story, &quot;Son of the Dragon&quot;, starring the 1602 version of the Hulk in the second issue of &quot;Hulk: Broken Worlds&quot;. In &quot;1602: Witchhunter Angela&quot; of Marvel&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event, Angela appears as a hunter of witchbreed (mutants).

The pocket reality seen at the end of the limited series in which the continuing Marvel 1602 universe takes place is classified as Earth-311. The series was loosely adapted into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) / Disney+ series &quot;What If...?&quot; episode &quot;What If... the Avengers Assembled in 1602?&quot; in 2023.

==Development==
===Background===
Neil Gaiman stated in an afterword to the series that he had always viewed the Marvel universe as &quot;magic&quot;. The editors of &quot;1602&quot;, Nick Lowe and Joe Quesada, approached Gaiman after Quesada became Marvel&#x27;s Editor in Chief with the intent for Gaiman to work on a project for Marvel. Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided that he did not want planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want it to be a war story, and I didn&#x27;t want to write a story in which might made right—or in which might made anything.&quot; On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the &quot;past seemed very close at hand&quot;; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because &quot;it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic.&quot;

Gaiman described writing the series as odd, since he had not written comics in half a decade; the story was trimmed down significantly as the size went from six 36-page chapters to eight 22-page segments. He also wanted to write a comic that was different from &quot;The Sandman&quot;, his most recognized work. The profits of the series went to help fund his Marvels and Miracles LLC company, which was fighting for the rights to Marvelman.

===Illustration===

Unlike usual penciled pages, &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; used a technique called &quot;enhanced pencils&quot;, whereby the finished pencil drawings are sent straight to the colorist instead of to an inker first. This technique had been used before on Kubert&#x27;s &quot;Origin&quot;, and results in cleaner and more elaborate lines.

Editor Nick Lowe noticed theater posters done by Scott McKowen and decided that the &quot;engraving &#x27;look&#x27; of the scratchboard would be interesting for the historical setting of this story.&quot; Scratchboard is a technique where a sharp knife is used to scrape through a layer of black ink to a hard chalk surface underneath; in effect, artists draw white lines on an all-black surface. All McKowen&#x27;s illustrations were done by hand and then colored later in Photoshop. For inspiration, McKowen looked at 17th-century engravings. He also added scrolls or flags to the covers for the &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; titles, basing the designs on Renaissance paintings where scrolls are used to comment on the scenes depicted.

The hardbound edition features a scratchboard illustration depicting the main characters whispering discreetly to each other on the cover. According to McKowen, the image was inspired by a depiction of the masterminds behind the &quot;Gunpowder Plot&quot;, an attempt to blow up Parliament during the reign of King James. Since the characters of the story are all traitors in the eyes of King James, they were drawn in a similar fashion.

==Synopsis==
===Premise===
In the year 1602 in the Marvel Universe, for an unknown reason, superheroes have appeared about 400 years early. They were born and bred in this era and some hold important positions in high places. When the characters come to realize that something is wrong with the universe, the heroes must solve the mystery behind their own existence, while dealing with intrigue at the courts of Elizabeth I and James.

===Plot===
All over Europe, strange weather provokes panic, with many believing that the unnatural occurrences are the beginning of the Apocalypse. Dr. Stephen Strange, the court physician of Elizabeth I, senses that there are unnatural forces at work. He has also been asked to watch over the secret treasure of the Knights Templar which is being brought to England from Jerusalem. Elizabeth tasks her head of intelligence, Sir Nicholas Fury, to bring the treasure—believed to be a weapon—to England safely. Fury in turn contracts blind minstrel and agent Matthew Murdoch to rendezvous with the Templar guard somewhere in Europe and secure the weapon. Later that evening, Fury and his assistant Peter Parquagh are attacked by an assassin whom Fury disables and locks in the Tower of London.

Meanwhile, the ship &quot;Virginia Maid&quot; arrives in England from the New World, carrying the young Virginia Dare, the first child born in Roanoke colony, as well as her Native American bodyguard Rojhaz. They are taken to meet the Queen only for a second winged assassin to snatch Virginia. Rohjaz quickly disables the attacker, but not before Virginia transforms into a white gryphon. Rojhaz subdues Virginia, and Strange bespells her to human form before Fury sees her. Dare&#x27;s powers cause Strange to suspect that she is the cause of the disastrous weather. Fury interrogates the imprisoned assassin to learn who sent him. He is told that it is Count Otto von Doom, ruler of Latveria, but Fury is too late to stop one of Doom&#x27;s machines from killing Elizabeth with a poison gas released by dropping a pill into aqua regia.

Upon Elizabeth&#x27;s death, James VI becomes ruler of both England and Scotland. James is distrustful of &quot;witchbreed&quot;, those with magical or uncanny powers, and collaborates with Spanish High Inquisitor Enrique to blame the witchbreed of England, headed by Carlos Javier, for Elizabeth&#x27;s death. Fury, a friend of Javier and his students, is forced to take the witchbreed to the Tower. Strange, Javier, and Fury meet and discuss how to save the world; an act which will almost surely lead to them being branded traitors by James. Strange learns that Natasha, a fellow agent, has betrayed Murdoch and the Templar agent Donal to Doom. Strange also learns that Doom has been holding captive four heroes from the ship &quot;Fantastick&quot;, including Fury&#x27;s friend Sir Richard Reed. Javier agrees to help Fury, and the party sets out on a ship levitated by Javier and his page John Grey across the continent.

Strange meanwhile finds himself on the moon where he meets the Watcher Uatu, who tells him that the strange events are due to an anomaly he calls the Forerunner. The Forerunner is from the future and its presence in the past has disrupted reality to the point of impending annihilation of not only Strange&#x27;s world but all other universes as well. Explaining his theory that the emergence of various superhumans on Stephen&#x27;s Earth four hundred years before their season is the result of the universe trying to save itself, the Watcher tells Strange that he will not be able to repeat what he has learned while he lives.

Fury, Javier, and his students launch a successful attack on Doom&#x27;s fortress; John Grey, revealed to be female, dies from her exertions in keeping the ship intact. The Four of the &quot;Fantastick&quot; are freed, and Doom is horribly scarred when lightning strikes a golden ball that he believes is the Templar&#x27;s treasure. In fact, the true treasure is Donal&#x27;s walking stick, which when struck on the ground transforms into the hammer Mjolnir and Donal into the Norse god Thor. The ship of fugitives heads for the New World. In Spain, Enrique is exposed as both a witchbreed and a Jew, and sentenced to be burned at the stake with his young acolytes, Petros and Sister Wanda. Using his powers, Enrique frees himself and his acolytes, and they escape on a ship of their own, also bound for America.

Strange is executed by James, who is furious that Fury and the witchbreed escaped him. Now no longer constrained by the Watcher&#x27;s oath, Strange communicates telepathically with his wife Clea. He informs her that the Forerunner is the cause of the anomalies and that universal salvation depends on its transport back to its time; she takes his head from its pike at the Tower of London and sets off for America with Virginia and Rojhaz. Clea voices her opinion that Strange&#x27;s suspicions were wrong, and that the Forerunner is not Virginia. Rojhaz confirms this, revealing himself to be Steve Rogers. After fighting against a 21st-century dictatorship led by a President for Life, Rogers was captured and sent back in time so as to completely erase his legacy. He was taken in by Native Americans who misheard his name; upon encountering the struggling Roanoke colony, he helped it survive and became Virginia&#x27;s bodyguard.

Fury and company arrive at the Roanoke colony, where they discover the rift through which Rogers arrived. Javier senses three ships incoming: the &quot;Virginia Maid&quot;, Enrique&#x27;s ship, and a ship carrying James&#x27;s agents, among them his advisor David Banner and Parquagh, who has been coerced into loyalty. Realizing that the rift is radiating &quot;galvanic&quot; energy, Javier enlists Enrique to manipulate the rift in exchange for an unspecified boon. Donal summons Thor once more, enabling the necessary input of energy to open the rift again. On the beach, Fury kills all of James&#x27;s agents except for Parquagh and Banner. In England, Murdoch threatens James with death should he harm Fury. Rogers refuses to go back through the rift, hoping to build a better America. Fury incapacitates him and carries the body back through the rift, thus going into the future himself.

The rift and the universe restore themselves, meaning the destruction of the alternate timeline; however, Uatu the Watcher is granted a &quot;pocket universe&quot; by his colleagues in which the 1602 timeline remains intact, and where the powered fugitives decide to settle in the Roanoke colony, declaring it a free place for all. Meanwhile, while walking in the woods with Virginia, Peter is bitten by a spider exposed to the energies released when Rojhaz and Fury entered the rift. Banner, who shielded Peter from the energies, has changed into a hulking gray monster. Intrigued by the continuing events, Uatu continues to watch the new universe (later designated Earth-311).

==Characters==

&quot;1602&quot; features both historical figures and many of the original Marvel superheroes and villains. Some popular characters, such as Wolverine, were not added because of Gaiman&#x27;s vision to address the heroes of the 1960s. &quot;The territory doesn&#x27;t go much further than 1969 in terms of the characters that I picked to use,&quot; Gaiman noted. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get everybody in because there are an awful lot of Marvel characters.&quot;

* Elizabeth I of England: The aging Queen of England. Already close to death, she is killed by a poisonous gas device constructed by Otto von Doom (the Doctor Doom of this reality).
* James I of England: Originally King James VI of Scotland, James becomes the monarch over England as well with Elizabeth&#x27;s death. James maintains an intense hatred of witchbreed (the mutants of this reality) and seeks to destroy them along with any who practice sorcery or witchcraft.
* Virginia Dare: The daughter of Ananias Dare, and the first English child born in the Americas. In this world, the Roanoke Colony did not disappear in the 1580s; when Steve Rogers went into this world he saved the colony, which would have been killed by starvation. Dare touches the rift caused by Rogers&#x27; arrival. She has the ability to transform into white-furred animals when frightened, which she later learns to control, and appears to be the equivalent to Alpha Flight&#x27;s Snowbird who has a similar appearance and powers, though Neil Gaiman had denied this.
* Uatu, the Watcher: A younger member of a race of intelligent beings who have sworn not to interfere in the affairs of lesser races, only to watch and observe. He breaks this oath, however, by explaining the situation to an astral projection of Doctor Stephen Strange.
* Sir Nicholas Fury: The Queen&#x27;s intelligence officer (referred to as the &quot;intelligencer&quot;) and responsible for foiling many past plots against the monarch. Seemingly killed when he carries an unconscious Rojhaz into the dimensional rift.
* Doctor Stephen Strange: The Queen&#x27;s Physician, who is also a magician and alchemist. He allows himself to be beheaded by King James, which subsequently frees him from the restriction placed upon him by Uatu the Watcher (namely, that he could not reveal what he knows while still living).
* Peter Parquagh: Sir Nicholas&#x27; apprentice; left orphaned and tended to by his aunt and uncle until Fury arrived and took the boy to London.
* Matthew Murdoch: A blind Irish minstrel who moonlights as a freelance agent. Matthew was blinded by a mysterious substance he encountered as a child; yet from it, he also acquired heightened senses.
* Clea Strange: Stephen Strange&#x27;s wife and assistant, Clea actually comes from another dimension. After bringing her husband&#x27;s severed head to the Roanoke colony—thus fulfilling her last promise to him—she asks the heroes to bury the head with the rest of the body and then returns to her home dimension.
* Rojhaz: Virginia&#x27;s blonde-haired, blue-eyed Native American bodyguard, who in fact is a displaced Captain America from a dystopian future. When the government of his time ruled by Purple Man captured him and attempted to execute him using advanced technology, he was accidentally sent back in time—the event which triggered the alternate timeline to begin with—thus forming the paradox of the story.
* Carlos Javier: A Spaniard living in England, where he runs a &quot;College for the Sons of Gentlefolk&quot;, in fact a haven for &quot;witchbreed&quot;. His students include Roberto Trefusis, Scotius Summerisle, Hal McCoy, Werner, and &quot;John&quot; Grey (who is in fact a young woman with psychic powers rivaling his own).
* The Four from the &quot;Fantastick&quot;: A band of explorers who gained powers when their ship encountered a strange energy vortex at sea. The four are Captain Benjamin Grimm, Sir Richard Reed, Susan Storm, and John Storm. Their bodies were reshaped into the four elements: Reed&#x27;s body became pliable like water, Grimm&#x27;s body became solid rock, Susan&#x27;s body became weightless and invisible like air, and John&#x27;s body became living fire. They are eventually captured by Doom.
* Grand Inquisitor Enrique: Born a Sephardic Jew, a young Enrique was forcibly baptized and seduced by a Catholic priest, and thus inducted into the church. As an adult, he leads the Spanish Inquisition—a position of power through which he can further his own plans. Although ordered to execute the witchbreed, he hides those whom he can pass off as normal. Secretly a witchbreed himself, he uses his activities as a cover to form a &quot;Brotherhood of Those Who Will Inherit the Earth&quot;. He is assisted by Sister Wanda and Petros, who are secretly his children. He is also aided by Toad, despite Toad&#x27;s betrayal at one point.
* David Banner: An advisor to King James, Banner is sent to Roanoke in order to kill Fury. When the rift is closed at the end of the story, Banner is caught within the backlash and is later seen lurking in the nearby woods as a massive gray-skinned creature (the Hulk).
* Count Otto von Doom: Doom is the ruler of Latveria, known as Otto the Handsome due to his perfect physique and appearance. He captures the Fantastick Four in order to force Reed&#x27;s compliance in creating war machines, poisons, and various other inventions. Von Doom is later struck and badly burned by Thor&#x27;s lightning, although he survives.
* Donal: The Guardian of the Templar Treasure and alter ego to Thor, who is captured by Count Otto von Doom on his way to deliver the treasure of the Templars (the hammer Mjolnir disguised as a simple walking stick) to England. He is rescued by Sir Nicholas Fury and the witchbreed and is taken to the New World along with the Fantastick Four.
* Natasha: She travels with Matthew while en route to meet Donal, who is bringing the Templar Treasure to England. Natasha is revealed to be working for Count Otto von Doom.

==Reception and legacy==
The first issue of &quot;1602&quot; was ranked first in August 2003 US comics with pre-order sales of 150,569.

&quot;1602&quot; received mixed praise upon its release with Comics Bulletin stating &quot;Is &quot;1602&quot; good? Yes, it&#x27;s damn good. Is it revolutionary or even ground breaking? No. Sorry, but I can&#x27;t go so far as to call a glorified What If? series anything more than what it is; a well done re-imagination of the Marvel Universe.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; declared that the combination of writing and moody artwork meant &quot;the Marvel Universe hasn&#x27;t been this engrossing in ages.&quot; ShakingThrough.net noted that fans looking for elements of Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; would be disappointed; &quot;It&#x27;s not a senses-shattering Marvel epic, but then it&#x27;s not meant to be. It&#x27;s nothing more or less than a chance to enjoy reinterpretations of some familiar characters.&quot; UGO Networks concurred, stating &quot;there doesn&#x27;t need to be a &#x27;point&#x27; in re-imagining familiar icons—it&#x27;s simply meant to be fun. [...] The result of &quot;1602&quot; is agreeable entertainment.&quot; The series won several awards, including the Quill Book Award for Graphic Novels. The first issue was also awarded the 2003 Diamond Distributors Gem Award as &quot;Comic of the Year&quot;.

Conversely, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; listed it as the worst comic of 2003, although the list&#x27;s composer later stated &quot;he didn&#x27;t actually mean it was the worst comic of the year.&quot; UGO&#x27;s Darren Latta noted as a downside to the series that &quot;the approach maybe a little too subdued at times.&quot; Latta also felt that despite being familiar with the setting, Gaiman never utilized the period to its full potential. Others simply felt that Gaiman&#x27;s involvement led to inflated expectations; one review noted that while reading &quot;I [...] felt at times like maybe it was all a little bit too cute, a little bit too in-jokey.&quot;

James Fleming, an adjunct instructor at Keiser University and Southern New Hampshire University, has also written about the use of the postmodern tradition in &quot;1602&quot; and how this is employed as a means to respond to the post-9/11 world in which the comic was written.

===Sequels===
&quot;1602&quot;″s success led to three sequels.

* The first, &quot;1602: New World&quot;, takes place shortly after the end of &quot;1602&quot;, with the heroes settling down in America. The series was written by Greg Pak and illustrated by Greg Tocchini, and the first issue was published in August 2005. During that time, Lord Iron and Captain Ross had arrived to hunt down David Banner while coming into conflict with the Spider and Virginia Dare. Meanwhile, Master Osborn tries to turn the natives against the settlers.
* The second sequel, &quot;Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four&quot;, was written by Peter David and pencilled by Pascal Alixe. The story involves the Fantastic Four&#x27;s adventures in London, the return of Otto von Doom, and the &quot;Four Who Are Frightful&quot; when they capture William Shakespeare to chronicle Otto von Doom&#x27;s travels to Bensaylum (this reality&#x27;s Alantis).
* The third sequel &quot;Spider-Man: 1602&quot;, was written by Jeff Parker and pencilled by Ramon Rosanas. The story centers on the continuing adventures of the Spider and features reinterpretations of Doctor Octopus, the Lizard, and Mary Jane Watson. Also appearing are the Beast, Janet and Henry Pym, the Kingpin (reimaged as a pirate named King&#x27;s Pin), Bullseye (reimaged as an assassin and first mate of the King&#x27;s Pin), and Steve Rogers.

===Spider-Verse===

Peter attempts to defend himself, but Morlun proves too powerful. Morlun brings down the Globe Theater around everyone, and absorbs Peter&#x27;s life essence. Before disappearing into another dimension, Morlun declares that all spiders will die.

Additionally, Marvel Studios producer Kevin Feige has also stated that he is interested in a &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; series alongside &quot;Earth X&quot;, but noted that there must be a built-in audience for it. 
* The Marvel 1602 reality appears in the second season of &quot;What If...?&quot; (2023). The universe primarily appears in the episode &quot;What If... the Avengers Assembled in 1602?&quot;, which was produced without Neil Gaiman&#x27;s involvement.

<text>Robert &quot;Robbie&quot; Conal (born 1944) is an American guerrilla poster artist noted for his gnarled, grotesque depictions of U.S. political figures of note. A former hippie, he is noted for distributing his poster art throughout a city overnight using his &quot;volunteer guerrilla postering army&quot;.

==Overview==

Conal&#x27;s parents were both union organizers, and he grew up in Manhattan. He &quot;graduated&quot; in arts from San Francisco State University in 1969, although he was two credits short of a degree. After living briefly in Canada he obtained a MFA from Stanford University in 1978, and moved to the Los Angeles area in 1984, where he currently resides. Conal is an adjunct professor of painting and drawing at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Roski School of Fine Arts.

Conal&#x27;s work has been featured in numerous publications, including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, as well as CBS&#x27;s &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; and &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;. He was the subject of the 1992 documentary &quot;Post No Bills&quot; directed by filmmaker Clay Walker. He has also written three books, including &quot;Art Attack: The Midnight Politics Of A Guerrilla Artist&quot; &quot;Artburn,&quot; a collection of his work published in the alternative newspaper &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;, and, &quot;Not Your Typical Political Animal&quot;, with his wife, Deborah Ross. He has been awarded grants by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Getty Trust.

In 2004, Conal joined artists Shepard Fairey and Mear One to create a series of &quot;anti-war, anti-Bush&quot; posters for a street art campaign called &quot;Be the Revolution&quot; for the art collective Post Gen.

Conal was also one of the 112 members at the &quot;Table of Free Voices&quot; event in Berlin.

His art is in the permanent collections of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the San Jose Museum of Art, and the San Diego Museum of Art. Conal&#x27;s posters have been prominently displayed in several major motion pictures, including, &quot;Sneakers&quot;, &quot;Falling Down&quot;, &quot;The Insider&quot;, &quot;Dead Presidents&quot;, &quot;Contagion&quot;, and &quot;The Sessions&quot;.

<text>Rice Krispies (known as Rice Bubbles in Australia and New Zealand) is a breakfast cereal produced by WK Kellogg Co for the United States, Canadian, and Caribbean markets and by Kellanova for the rest of the world. Rice Krispies are made of crisped rice. When milk is added to the cereal the rice tends to collapse, creating the characteristic &quot;snap, crackle and pop&quot; sounds.

Rice Krispies cereal has a long advertising history with the elf cartoon characters Snap, Crackle and Pop touting the brand.

==Background==
Rice Krispies was released to the public by the Kellogg Company in 1928. 

The original patent called for using partially dried grain, which could be whole or broken, that would have 15–30% moisture which could then be shaped by existing processes for cereal production that include rolling, flaking, shredding, etc. After being processed to the desired shape the grain is dried to around 5–14% moisture content at which stage the grain will expand when subjected to a high temperature creating a light, low-density product that is crisp and easy to chew.

The &quot;Snap, Crackle and Pop&quot; slogan was in use by 1939 when the cereal was advertised as staying &quot;crackly crisp in milk or cream...not mushy!&quot; with claims that the cereal would remain floating (without sinking to the bottom of the bowl) even after 2 hours in milk. They were not a shredded or flaked cereal type, but were instead created by a patented process that Kellogg&#x27;s called &quot;oven-popping&quot;.

Following the 2023 spinoff of the North American cereal division of the original Kellogg Company, Rice Krispies are made by WK Kellogg Co for the United States, Canadian, and Caribbean markets and by Kellanova (the former Kellogg Company) for the rest of the world.

==Ingredients==
Rice Krispies contain rice, sugar, salt, malt flavoring, iron, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), alpha tocopherol acetate (vitamin E), niacinamide, vitamin A palmitate, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), riboflavin (vitamin B2), thiamin hydrochloride (vitamin B1), folic acid, vitamin B12 (as cyanocobalamin) and vitamin D.

According to Kellogg&#x27;s, the rice used in the US version of the cereal is grown in the states of Louisiana and Arkansas.

===Health claims===
In 2010 the Kellogg Company was found by the Federal Trade Commission to be making unsubstantiated and misleading health claims in advertising on Rice Krispies boxes. Claims made by the company included &quot;now helps support your child&#x27;s immunity&quot; and &quot;has been improved to include antioxidants and nutrients that your family needs to help them stay healthy.&quot; The FTC had previously found fault with Kellogg&#x27;s claims that Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal improved children&#x27;s attentiveness by nearly 20%.

==Variants==

===Present day===
The names of other products within the Rice Krispies family vary depending on where they are sold:
* Cocoa Krispies (called Coco Pops in the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Greece and Italy), a chocolate flavored version (sold worldwide)
* Rice Krispies with Vanilla Flavor, sold in Canada and South Africa
* Chocolate and Vanilla Rice Krispies, a cereal containing mixed flavor Rice Krispies (introduced in 2007)
* Rice Krispies Treats Cereal, contains bunches of krispies fused together by a marshmallow coating (introduced in March 1993)
* Strawberry Pops, sold in South Africa
* Kellogg&#x27;s Strawberry Krispies
* Kellogg&#x27;s Rainbow Krispies
Many generic versions of Rice Krispies (including frosted and chocolate variants) have been produced by other manufacturers under many different names.

===Discontinued===
* Frosted Rice Krispies (called Ricicles in the UK and Ireland)
* Rice Krispies with dehydrated miniature marshmallows (Marshmallow Rice Krispies, also known as Marshmallow Krispies, along with a tropical version, Fruity Marshmallow Krispies), were sold briefly in the United States and Canada. Despite surviving longer in Canada than the United States, they were discontinued during the late 1990s.
*Rice Krispies with strawberry flavor included 1983&#x27;s Strawberry Krispies and 1997&#x27;s Strawberry Rice Krispies. Australia had Strawberry Pops, a strawberry version of Rice Bubbles, which was discontinued in the mid-1970s, along with other similarly coloured and sweetened foods, due to concerns about the additives causing cancer. Banana-flavored Rice Krispies, including Banana Bubbles and Banana Krispies, have also been sold in the past.
*Razzle Dazzle Rice Krispies, an extremely sweet, artificially-colored cereal, was sold from late 1997 to 1999.
*Apple Cinnamon Rice Krispies, a cereal flavored with apple and cinnamon, was sold in the early 1990s.
*Rice Krispies with berry flavors, including Berry Krispies and Berry Rice Krispies.
*Rice Krispies with honey, Honey Rice Krispies, was sold in the UK and Canada for a short period of time in the late 1990s.

In the late 1990s, Kellogg&#x27;s sold Halloween versions of their regular cereal. This included Halloween Rice Krispies which featured a variety of orange krispies.

===Rice Krispies Treats and similar sweets===
In 1939, Kellogg&#x27;s employee Mildred Day concocted and published a recipe for a Camp Fire Girls bake sale consisting of Rice Krispies, melted marshmallows, and margarine. It has remained a very popular snack dubbed Rice Krispies Treats. Kellogg&#x27;s themselves have now produced commercial varieties of both marshmallow and chocolate-based treats under the name Rice Krispies Squares in Canada and the UK, as well as versions under the original Rice Krispies Treats name sold in the United States.

Kellogg&#x27;s also produces commercial versions of Rice Krispie treats known as Rice Krispies Squares, cereal bars, and a multi-grain cereal known as Rice Krispies Multi-Grain (formerly Muddles) sold on the UK market. Primarily aimed at children, Multi-Grain contains a prebiotic and is claimed by Kellogg&#x27;s to promote good digestive health.

In Australia, Rice Bubbles are found in a well-known homemade sweet, the chocolate crackle. This is often found at fetes and consists of Rice Bubbles, copha and cocoa, amongst other things. In the UK, a similar treat is made of Rice Krispies and melted chocolate. White Christmas is another Australian sweet made with Rice Bubbles, milk powder, copha and dried fruit.

=== South African controversy ===
In 2018 the South African branch of Kellogg&#x27;s replaced the classic Rice Krispies with Rice Krispies Vanilla, thereby discontinuing the production of the original Rice Krispies in the country. This change was met with a lot of public complaints.

Kellogg&#x27;s South Africa posted the following on their Facebook page in response to the outrage of South African consumers: &quot;Rice Krispies Vanilla is a new product that was launched in South Africa in June this year, responding to many of our customers’ calls for more innovation and variety. With Rice Krispies Vanilla we have moved from a single grain to a multi-grain formula which has additional nutritional benefits and allows us to source locally, promoting local farmers and jobs. The New recipe also contains 9 vitamins &amp; iron. While we fully understand that in some instances people prefer the original plain Rice Krispies, several different recipes were tested in market, and the vanilla formulation was significantly preferred by our local consumers. We will continue to provide opportunities for testing and tasting in-store to share our new taste with consumers.&quot;

The new Rice Krispies Vanilla now contained 21.7 g sugar for every 100 g, up from only 9 g previously, and the taste was very poorly received. Despite the public&#x27;s obvious and vocal disgust with the product, Kellogg&#x27;s decided to stay firm in their decision on replacing the original Rice Krispies with the new Rice Krispies Vanilla, until 2020 when Kellogg&#x27;s returned the original product to shelves.

Zandi Mposelwa, head of external relations at Kellogg Sub Saharan Africa, released the following statement: &quot;We have decided to relaunch [the original Rice Krispies] in the market, whilst keeping the Rice Krispies Vanilla variant to ensure that we meet different consumer needs for variety. We are importing the product from the UK because we no longer have manufacturing capability to manufacture the product in South Africa.”

This meant that South African consumers would be paying more for the standard Rice Krispies: a 510 g box of imported original Rice Krispies will cost around ZAR 70. A 600 g box of Vanilla Rice Krispies currently costs ZAR 47.99.

== Marketing history ==

=== Cartoon mascots ===
Snap, Crackle and Pop, the animated cartoon mascots for Rice Krispies, were created by illustrator Vernon Grant in the 1930s. The original gnome-like Snap first appeared in 1933 on a package of Kellogg&#x27;s Rice Krispies. Crackle and Pop came later, and since 1939, the three have been together in many forms of advertising, including radio, movie shorts, and comic strips. An updated version of the elf-like Snap Crackle and Pop appeared for the first time on television in 1960; before that it was advertised by Woody Woodpecker. They are the first and longest-running cartoon characters to represent a Kellogg&#x27;s product. In physics, Snap, Crackle and Pop inspired shorthand names for the fourth, fifth, and sixth derivatives of position.

<doc id="654734" wikidata="Q7819952" url="?curid=654734" title="Tommy Tune">
<text>Thomas James Tune (born February 28, 1939) is an American actor, dancer, singer, theatre director, producer, and choreographer. Over the course of his career, he has won ten Tony Awards, the National Medal of Arts, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Tune was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, to oil rig worker, horse trainer, and restaurateur Jim Tune and Eva Mae Clark along with his sister, Gracey. He attended Mirabeau B. Lamar High School, Houston and the Methodist-affiliated Lon Morris College in Jacksonville, Texas. He studied dance under Patsy Swayze in Houston. He also studied dance with Kit Andree in Boulder, Colorado. He went on to earn his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Drama from the University of Texas at Austin in 1962 and his Master of Fine Arts in Directing from the University of Houston. Tune later moved to New York to start his career.

==Career==
Tune stands a lanky tall, and at first he found his height to be a disadvantage when auditioning for roles, as he would tower over potential co-stars. He wore horizontally striped shirts to auditions, dipped extra low when he did pliés and learned to dance upstage (&quot;I&#x27;d look shorter that way. It&#x27;s a law of perspective&quot;) to try to overcome it.

In 1965, Tune made his Broadway debut as a performer in the musical &quot;Baker Street&quot;. He gained national attention in 1969 when TV producer Greg Garrison hired him as a specialty dancer and assistant choreographer for &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and its summer replacement series, &quot;Dean Martin Presents The Golddiggers&quot;.

Tommy Tune became well known behind the scenes as a reliable dance expert. In 1978, when the musical-comedy revue &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; starring Jerry Lewis and Lynn Redgrave was having an out-of-town tryout, Tune was called in three weeks before the show&#x27;s Broadway bow: he arrived in Boston on a Saturday to debut in a dance number on the following Monday. Tune&#x27;s contribution came too late to save the show, which closed less than a week later when a plan to televise &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; suddenly fell through.

Tune&#x27;s first Broadway directing and choreography credits were for the original production of &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; in 1978. His direction of Maury Yeston&#x27;s &quot;Nine&quot; in 1982, which also won the Tony for Best Musical, garnered him his first Tony for direction of a musical. He has gone on to direct and/or choreograph eight Broadway musicals. He directed a new musical titled &quot;Turn of the Century&quot;, which premiered at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago on September 19, 2008, and closed on November 2, 2008.

Off-Broadway, Tune has directed &quot;The Club&quot; and &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;. Tune toured the United States in the Sherman Brothers musical &quot;Busker Alley&quot; in 1994–1995, and in the stage adaptation of the film &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; in 2006.

Tune is the only person to win Tony Awards in the same categories (Best Choreography and Best Direction of a Musical) in consecutive years (1990 and 1991), and the first to win in four categories. He has won ten Tony Awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015.

Tune appeared in a 1975 TV special titled &quot;Welcome to the &quot;World&quot;&quot; along with Lucie Arnaz and Lyle Waggoner to promote the opening of Space Mountain at Walt Disney World. His film credits include Ambrose Kemper in &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1969), directed by Gene Kelly and starring Barbra Streisand, &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1971) with Twiggy, and &quot;Mimì Bluette... fiore del mio giardino&quot; (1976) with Shelley Winters and Monica Vitti. He also appeared briefly on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; in 1988.

Tune released his first record album, &quot;Slow Dancin&#x27;,&quot; in 1997 on the RCA label featuring a collection of his favorite romantic ballads. In 1999, he made his Las Vegas debut as the star of &quot;EFX&quot; at the MGM Grand Las Vegas.

Tune staged an elaborate musical entitled &quot;Paparazzi&quot; for the Holland America Line cruise ship the Oosterdam in 2003. He works often with The Manhattan Rhythm Kings, for example touring in a Big Band revue entitled &quot;Song and Dance Man&quot; and &quot;White Tie and Tails&quot; (2002).

Tune performed in his musical revue, &quot;Steps in Time: A Broadway Biography in Song and Dance&quot;, in Boston in April 2008 and continuing in various venues from Bethesda, Maryland in January 2009 to California in February 2009.

The Tommy Tune Awards, presented annually by Theatre Under The Stars (TUTS), honor excellence in high school musical theatre in Houston. The current home of the Tommy Tune Awards is the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts in Houston, Texas.

Tune appeared as Argyle Austero in the revived fourth and fifth seasons of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; on Netflix. In 2015, he made a return to the New York stage as a featured performer in City Center&#x27;s staged concert Encores!. He was featured in two numbers in &quot;Lady, Be Good!&quot;; his first act number was the Gershwin standard &quot;Fascinating Rhythm.&quot;

In the eighteenth episode of the sixth season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;A Star Is Burns,&quot; the citizens of Springfield are invited to make their own movies for a town film festival. Mr. Burns&#x27;s film, &quot;A Burns for All Seasons,&quot; features Tune&#x27;s name in the credits, playing the role of Waylon Smithers.

==Personal life==
Before leaving Texas in the 1960s for a Broadway career in New York, Tune worked with Mary Highsmith (mother of novelist Patricia Highsmith) at the Point Summer Theatre. In a letter to her daughter, Highsmith referred to Tune as her &quot;adopted boy&quot; whom she called &quot;Romano.&quot; Tune later praised Highsmith for helping him develop his talents: &quot;She was an opening for me; she opened a little bit of my tight fabric so that I might peer through.&quot; When not performing, he used to run an art gallery in Tribeca that featured his own work. As of 2014, it is no longer open.

In 1997, Tune&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Footnotes&quot;, was published. In it, he wrote about what drives him as a performer, choreographer, and director and reminisced about his days with Twiggy in &quot;My One and Only&quot;; as well as meeting and working with his many idols. He further wrote about being openly gay in the world of theater; about losing his partner, choreographer David Steiger Wolfe, to AIDS in 1994, and about the unhappy ending of his relationship with &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; actor Michel Stuart. He also described a woman whom he did not name but who he said was the &quot;love of [his] life,&quot; and some media speculated that the description he gave appeared to fit Twiggy.

In September 2021, Tommy Tune was elected the honorary president of the American Guild of Variety Artists, the labor union for non-actor stage performers.

<text>Charles George Patrick Shaughnessy, 5th Baron Shaughnessy (born 9 February 1955) is a British actor. His roles on American television include Shane Donovan on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, Maxwell Sheffield on the sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot;, and the voice of Dennis the Goldfish on &quot;Stanley&quot; for which he won a Daytime Emmy Award. He had recurring roles as Christopher Plover on &quot;The Magicians&quot; and St. John Powell on &quot;Mad Men&quot;. Shaughnessy was a series regular on ABC daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; in the role of villain Victor Cassadine.

Along with his brother, David Shaughnessy, and Ophelia Soumekh, he is a partner in 3S Media Solutions Inc.

==Early life==
Shaughnessy was born on 9 February 1955 in London, the son of Alfred Shaughnessy, a television writer who was the scriptwriter for &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, and actress Jean Lodge. His brother, David Shaughnessy, is also an actor and a television producer and director. His great-grandfather Thomas Shaughnessy, the 1st Baron Shaughnessy, was an American-Canadian railway administrator of Irish descent. Charles inherited the title when his second cousin Michael (1946–2007), the 4th Baron Shaughnessy, died without issue.

Having been born into a show-business family, Shaughnessy started appearing in plays during primary school. After attending Eton College, he read for a law degree at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he wrote a thesis on the House of Lords.

While at Cambridge, he joined the Footlights club. After graduating, he decided to return to acting and enrolled in a London drama school, which led to his touring in a repertory company. He moved to the United States and married the actress Susan Fallender in 1983, with whom he has two daughters, Jenny (born 1990) and Maddy (born 1995).

==Career==

Shaughnessy appeared as Shane Donovan on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1984 to 1992. His character&#x27;s romance with Patsy Pease&#x27;s character, Kimberly Brady, made the duo into a soap supercouple and revived interest in &quot;Days&quot; among teenage viewers in the 1980s. In 1986, he appeared with Betty White and Bert Convy on &quot;Super Password&quot;, and in January 1993, Shaughnessy appeared in an episode of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; as the title character&#x27;s date to the inaugural ball.

Shaughnessy portrayed Maxwell Sheffield opposite Fran Drescher on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Nanny&quot; from 1993 to 1999. He and Drescher resumed acting together in Drescher&#x27;s next sitcom, &quot;Living with Fran&quot;, wherein Shaughnessy appeared fairly frequently as her philandering but needy ex-husband, Ted. &quot;Living with Fran&quot; was cancelled on 17 May 2006, after two seasons.

In 1996, Shaughnessy reunited with another &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; co-star—Charlotte Ross, who portrayed Shane&#x27;s daughter, Eve Donovan—in the TV movie &quot;A Kiss So Deadly&quot;. Ross played the roommate of Shaughnessy&#x27;s daughter (Dedee Pfeiffer); Shaughnessy&#x27;s character, although married, forms an obsessive, &quot;Lolita&quot;-esque relationship with Ross. When she tries to break it off, Shaughnessy&#x27;s character murders Ross&#x27;s character; gradually, his daughter uncovers the truth.

Shaughnessy appeared (in a dual role) in the Disney Channel 2002 made-for-TV movie &quot;Get a Clue&quot;. He was also in the 2000 made-for-TV Halloween movie &quot;Mom&#x27;s Got a Date with a Vampire&quot; starring Caroline Rhea; she guest-starred on &quot;The Nanny&quot; in 1998 as part of a cross-over with &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. That same year, Shaughnessy made two appearances on The WB&#x27;s &quot;Sabrina&quot; (starring Rhea, Melissa Joan Hart, and Beth Broderick), playing two different characters. He played Alec Colson in the 8th-season episode &quot;Covenant&quot; of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. He also voiced Dr. Quintaine in the PC game &quot;Freelancer&quot;.

Shaughnessy appeared on an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and is also the voice of Dennis the Goldfish on the Disney Channel cartoon series &quot;Stanley&quot;. On 11 May 2002, Shaughnessy won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program for his portrayal of Dennis.

On 8 August 2008, Shaughnessy portrayed the murder victim (Samuel, Guru) in &quot;Murder 101: The Locked Room Mystery&quot;. As of September 2008, his voice was heard in television commercials for Range Rover cars. In December 2008, he provided the voice of Pietro in &quot;The Tale of Despereaux&quot;. He also portrayed the Cockney English accent for &quot;The Boss&quot; in the game &quot;Saints Row 2&quot;.

On 5 May 2009, Shaughnessy made a guest appearance in the series &quot;The Mentalist&quot; episode &quot;Miss Red&quot; as the manager of a private club. He also appeared on the popular TV show &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; as a talent show judge modeled after Simon Cowell in the episode &quot;Judge Me Tender&quot;.

Shaughnessy returned to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in May 2010, in a storyline associated with the funeral of Alice Horton (played by Frances Reid), briefly reuniting him with his former co-star Patsy Pease (Kimberly). This plot development was necessitated by the real-world death of the actress who had long portrayed Mrs. Horton, as the producers were aware that the audience would not accept the portrayal of the character by anyone else.

In August–September 2010, Shaughnessy appeared as King Arthur in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Spamalot!&quot; at The Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine. In January 2011, he won the Broadway World Boston Theater Award for Best Lead Actor in a Musical (Large Theater). Since 2010, Shaughnessy has starred on the soap opera web series &quot;The Bay&quot; as Elliot Sanders. On 6 December 2010, he reunited with Fran Drescher as a guest on her limited-run daytime show, &quot;The Fran Drescher Show.&quot;

In June 2011, Shaughnessy appeared as Henry Higgins in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; at the North Shore Music Theatre in Beverly, Massachusetts, and returned there to play Georges in &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; in fall 2013 . He made a guest appearance on the first-season finale of Fran Drescher&#x27;s TV Land sitcom, &quot;Happily Divorced&quot;, first airing on 17 August 2011.

Shaughnessy returned to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; for a limited run in May 2012 as Shane Donovan, in a storyline involving his return to the ISA and interacting with Hope and Bo Brady and Stefano DiMera. His co-star Patsy Pease did not appear as Shane&#x27;s wife, Kimberly, in this story arc; nor did Charlotte Ross, who had played Shane&#x27;s daughter, Eve. He also returned in November 2013 for a three-episode arc, in which Shane and Kimberly deal with their daughter&#x27;s drug use.

On 23 January 2014, it was announced that Shaughnessy would assume the lead role in the play &quot;Harvey&quot; at the New Theatre in Overland Park, Kansas, after original star Judge Reinhold was offered the opportunity to leave the production.

In August 2014, Shaughnessy made a guest appearance on the Disney Channel show &quot;Dog with a Blog&quot; as business tycoon Tom Fairbanks, a man who wanted to buy Stan, the title character, and use him as the spokes-dog for his animal rescue campaign.

Set in Port Washington, Wisconsin, it follows single parents Frank Lambert and Carol Foster (Patrick Duffy and Suzanne Somers), each with three children, who wed and form a blended family in spite of their children&#x27;s mutual resentment. It aired on ABC from September 20, 1991 to August 15, 1997, and then on CBS from September 19, 1997 to June 26, 1998, with a total of 160 half-hour episodes spanning seven seasons.

Among its co-stars are Staci Keanan, Angela Watson, and Christopher Castile as Carol&#x27;s children Dana, Karen, and Mark, Brandon Call, Christine Lakin, and Josh Byrne as Frank&#x27;s children J.T., Al, and Brendan, and Sasha Mitchell as Frank&#x27;s nephew Cody. 

The series was often described as a copy of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; because of its similar premise, and was otherwise ignored by critics after the pilot episode, which met with a consistently negative reception. Cancelled in May 1997 due to declining ratings, CBS acquired the series and &quot;Family Matters&quot; for their own Friday night comedy lineup, but only lasted for another season before it was officially cancelled in June 1998.

==Premise==
Frank Lambert, a divorced contractor whose wife left him, has three children: John Thomas (J.T.), Alicia (Al), and Brendan. Carol Foster, a widowed salon owner, also has three children: Dana, Karen, and Mark. Both families live in Port Washington, Wisconsin.

Frank and Carol marry while vacationing in Jamaica after a whirlwind courtship. They planned to keep their marriage a secret, but Frank accidentally reveals to J.T. that they are married during a barbecue he and Carol hold to introduce all the children, leaving them surprised and angry at first.

Each episode depicts typical situations for a new blended family. Family members&#x27; differences cause arguments and resentments, but over time they grow to tolerate and become loyal to one another.

==Episodes==

==Production==

The series was created and executive produced by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and developed and executive produced by Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett. It was produced by Bickley-Warren Productions, Miller-Boyett Productions and Lorimar Television.

The opening sequence depicts the Foster-Lambert family at a lakeside amusement park in Port Washington. It was filmed at the inland Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, with a coastline digitally superimposed onto its parking lot in aerial shots. Prominently depicted in the sequence is Magic Mountain&#x27;s since-defunct Colossus wooden roller coaster.

ABC chose to delay the series&#x27; sixth season to the 1996–97 mid-season (premiering in March 1997), in order to make room on that season&#x27;s fall schedule for freshman sitcoms &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; and &quot;Clueless&quot;, which joined established series &quot;Family Matters&quot; and &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; on the TGIF lineup; the network canceled it after six seasons in May 1997, due to declining ratings. CBS concurrently reached a deal with Miller-Boyett Productions to acquire the rights to it and &quot;Family Matters&quot; from ABC, as that network attempted to build its own Friday night lineup of family-friendly situation comedies for the fall of 1997, called the &quot;CBS Block Party&quot;.

Ratings continued to decline despite the network change, and the show ended its run in June 1998 without an official series finale. According to Staci Keanan and Christine Lakin, the series was supposed to end with Dana and Rich&#x27;s wedding at the house, and elaborate preparations were underway for it prior to the series&#x27; abrupt end.

==Syndication==
In September 1995, Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution began distributing the series for broadcast in off-network syndication.

ABC Family was the first to acquire cable television rights to the series, and it became one of the cable channel&#x27;s longest-running off-network syndicated programs in its history. Reruns began airing on there in 2001 (on what was then known as Fox Family), airing in various timeslots during its run ranging from late afternoon to the morning hours. On March 26, 2010, ABC Family&#x27;s contract expired after less than nine years.

The series returned to U.S. syndication on October 7, 2013, when the Hub Network began airing reruns; the network dropped it on October 13, 2014, when the network became Discovery Family.

In Australia, &quot;Step by Step&quot; aired on the Seven Network from 1991 to 1995 and on the Nine Network from 1996 to 2000. In 2011, &quot;Step by Step&quot; was acquired by 7TWO. In 2015, 111 Greats started airing the whole series.

In the U.K., Seasons 1 and 2 of &quot;Step by Step&quot; aired sporadically on ITV weekday mornings at 10 throughout parts of the spring and summer in 1994 and 1995. Episodes were also shown to a lesser extent during 1996 and 1997.

On September 29, 2017, Hulu acquired the streaming rights to &quot;Step by Step&quot; along with fellow Warner Bros. TV properties &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot; and &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, in addition to fellow ABC programs &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;Home Improvement&quot;.

On October 1, 2021, &quot;Step by Step&quot; began streaming on Max after its streaming rights expired from Hulu.

TruTV aired reruns from December 30, 2022 to 2023 as part of their &quot;Comfort Food&quot; block.

==Home media==
Warner Home Video originally released a six-episode &quot;Television Favorites&quot; collection on DVD on June 27, 2006 until September 26, 2023 when the complete series set was finally released for the first time. Warner Archive Collection has released individual seasons on DVD in Region 1. These are Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) releases, available from Warner&#x27;s online store and Amazon.com.
==Critical reception==

According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Ken Tucker, &quot;Step by Step&quot; was generally regarded as a copy of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and otherwise ignored by critics. 

Reviews of the pilot episode were consistently negative, with Howard Rosenberg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; calling it &quot;plain awful&quot; and Matt Roush of &quot;USA Today&quot; describing it as &quot;demonically slick junk food&quot;; other critics declared it to be the &quot;worst&quot; new show of the season. It was frequently compared to &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot;, a critically acclaimed CBS series which premiered the same day, as representing the &quot;worst&quot; and &quot;best&quot; of television, respectively. &quot;Variety&#x27;s&quot; Jean Rosenbluth was more positive, calling it a &quot;modestly amusing, occasionally heartwarming show&quot; despite its &quot;utter lack of originality&quot;, and argued that while it wasn&#x27;t comparable to Shakespeare, &quot;neither was &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;&quot;.

Of the acting performances, Somers and Keanan received praise, even in otherwise negative reviews. Somers was singled out for praise by Rosenbluth and Roush. Rosenbluth described the children as a &quot;well-cast lot&quot;, in particular singling out Keanan as the &quot;most amusing&quot;; her &quot;wisecracking timing&quot; was commended by Ray Richmond of Knight-Ridder News Service, who in addition forwarded the actress as the &quot;best thing&quot; about the series, a sentiment echoed by Ron Weiskind of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, who found her to be the only one who &quot;shows any talent&quot; out of the cast.

&quot;Brady Bunch&quot; creator Sherwood Schwartz later said that at one point he considered filing a lawsuit over &quot;Step by Step&quot;, claiming that they &quot;stole my show&quot; and likening its advertising as a &quot;&quot;Brady Bunch&quot; for the 1990s&quot; to &quot;intrusion or certainly riding on coattails.&quot;

<doc id="654748" wikidata="Q4048685" url="?curid=654748" title="SAMPSON">
<text>The SAMPSON is a multi-function dual-face active electronically scanned array radar produced by BAE Systems Maritime. It is the fire control radar component of the Sea Viper naval air defence system. The Sea Viper system is also known as PAAMS(S) to denote the use of the SAMPSON radar and to distinguish it from the PAAMS system on the Franco-Italian Horizon-class frigate.

The SAMPSON multifunction radar can detect air and surface targets out to a distance of , and it is capable of tracking hundreds of targets at any one time. Sea Viper uses this information to assess and command target priorities and calculate the optimum launch time for its Aster missiles.

==History==
SAMPSON is derived from the Multifunction Electronically Scanned Adaptive Radar (MESAR) programme. MESAR 1 development commenced in 1982 as a partnership between Plessey, Roke Manor Research, and the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. Plessey was acquired by Siemens in 1989 to become Siemens-Plessey, itself acquired by British Aerospace in 1998. British Aerospace became BAE Systems in November 1999. MESAR 1 trials occurred between 1989 and 1994. MESAR 2 development began in August 1995, of which SAMPSON is a derivative.

The Royal Navy intended to deploy the SAMPSON multifunction radar (MFR) on its version of the Horizon-class frigate (also known as Common New Generation Frigate or CNGF), a collaboration with France and Italy to produce anti-air warfare warships. Following delays and complications, the UK withdrew and started its own Type 45 programme. The Type 45 destroyer uses the SAMPSON radar with the PAAMS missile system, which was also developed for the Horizon frigates (French and Italian ships are to be fitted with the EMPAR MFR). The SAMPSON Radar is made in Cowes, Isle of Wight.

In September 2013, Type 45 destroyer HMS &quot;Daring&quot; was positioned near missile launch sites at US Army Kwajalein Atoll to take part in a trial assessing SAMPSON&#x27;s ability to detect and track ballistic missiles, a capability it was not originally intended to have. During the trial, the system successfully detected two simulated medium-range ballistic missiles. Director of the UK Missile Defence Centre, Simon Pavitt, said, &quot;This work has raised the profile of the Ballistic Missile Defence potential [...] and will support an ongoing Missile Defence Centre programme to further explore key issues.&quot;

==Operation==

Conventional radars, consisting of a rotating transmitter and sensor, have limited power, are vulnerable to enemy jamming, and perform only one function—with separate units therefore required for surveillance, tracking, and targeting.

As an active array, SAMPSON uses software to shape and direct its beam, allowing several functions to be carried out at once and, through adaptive waveform control, is virtually immune to enemy jamming. Active arrays have both longer range and higher accuracy than conventional radars. The beam-directing software uses sophisticated algorithms to schedule searches so that the potentially hundreds of active tracks are maintained with maximum accuracy.

The SAMPSON uses two planar arrays to provide coverage over only part of the sky; complete coverage is provided by rotating the arrays, similar to the way conventional radar systems operate. This is in contrast to the US AN/SPY-1 (as used on the and Flight I–IIA ) and AN/SPY-6 (as used on the Flight III &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer) or the Dutch APAR system (as used on the Royal Netherlands Navy&#x27;s , the German Navy&#x27;s , and the Royal Danish Navy&#x27;s ), which use multiple arrays fixed in place to provide continuous coverage of the entire sky.

Although the SAMPSON radar does not provide continuous 360-degree coverage, it rotates at 30 revolutions per minute, and with two back-to-back arrays, no part of the sky lacks coverage for more than half a second on average (the precise time varies as the beams can also be swept back and forth electronically). In addition, the use of a smaller number of arrays allows the system to be much lighter, allowing placement of the arrays at the top of a prominent mast rather than on the side of the superstructure as in the Dutch or US ships. Placing any radar emitter at a higher altitude extends the horizon distance, improving performance against low-level or sea-skimming targets; SAMPSON is at approximately double the height above the waterline than the arrays of equivalent ships in foreign navies. Although precise details of the SAMPSON&#x27;s performance in this regard are unlikely to enter the public domain, such factors may mitigate the disadvantages of fewer arrays.

Some tasks are difficult to combine: for example, (long-range) volume search consumes substantial radar resources, leaving little room for other tasks like targeting. Combining volume search with other tasks also results either in slow search rates or in low overall quality per task. Driving parameters in radar performance is time-on-target or observation time per beam. This led to the Royal Navy selecting the S1850M long-range radar to complement SAMPSON on the Type 45 destroyers. This also resulted in the NATO Anti-Air Warfare System study (NAAWS) defining the preferred AAW system as consisting of a complementary Volume Search Radar and MFR. This gives the added advantage that the two systems can use two different radar frequencies; one being a good choice for long-range search, the other a good choice for an MFR (physics makes both tasks difficult to combine).

The first Type 45, , was launched on February 1, 2006. The ship was fitted with SAMPSON and S1850M radars in 2007 and was commissioned on 23 July 2009.

<text>John Young (June 12, 1802April 23, 1852) was an American politician. He served in the New York State Assembly (1832, 1845–1846), the United States House of Representatives (1836–1837, 1841–1843) and as the fifteenth Governor of New York (1847–1848).

==Early life==
Young was born in Chelsea, Vermont on June 12, 1802. As a child, his family moved to Freeport (now Conesus) in Livingston County, New York, where his parents operated an inn. He attended the schools of Conesus and Lima Academy in Lima, New York. His academy education enabled him to qualify as a schoolteacher, after which he taught at schools in Livonia, New York. He later studied law with Augustus A. Bennett of East Avon, New York, and Ambrose Bennett of Geneseo, New York.

In 1829, Young was admitted to the bar, after which he began a practice in Geneseo. Among the prospective attorneys who later studied under him was his brother in law James Wood, and Young and Wood later formed a partnership.

==Start of career==
He entered politics as a Jacksonian Democrat, but shortly afterward joined the Anti-Masonic Party. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1832.

Young was elected as a Whig to the 24th United States Congress, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Philo C. Fuller, holding office from November 1836 to March 3, 1837. In 1840 he was elected to the 27th United States Congress, holding office from March 4, 1841, to March 3, 1843.

He was again a member of the Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1845 and 1846.

==Governor of New York==
In 1846 Young was the Whig nominee for governor. He defeated incumbent Silas Wright and served one term, from January 1847 to December 1848.

As governor, Young favored expanding the Erie Canal, oversaw establishment of the state court of appeals, and opposed the Mexican War. He also pardoned farmers who had been imprisoned for participating in the Anti-Rent War, including leader Smith A. Boughton.

In 1848 Young was defeated for the Whig nomination for governor by Hamilton Fish, who went on to win the general election.

==Later career==
In 1848 Young was a delegate to the 1848 national convention. He first backed Henry Clay for president, but supported Zachary Taylor after Taylor was nominated. After Taylor assumed office he rewarded Young with the appointment as Assistant Treasurer of the United States in New York City. Young served until his death in New York City from tuberculosis on April 23, 1852. He was buried at Temple Hill Cemetery in Geneseo.

==Family==
In 1833 Young married Ellen Harris of York, New York. They were the parents of four children.

<text>[[Birmingham]] is a major transport hub, due in part to its location in central England. The city is well connected by rail, road, and water. Public transport and key highways in the city are overseen by Transport for West Midlands (TfWM).

==Railways==
===History===
The first railway station to open in Birmingham was Vauxhall station, which opened in 1837 as a temporary railway shed. It served as the temporary Birmingham terminus of the Grand Junction Railway from Warrington. Curzon Street railway station opened in 1838 as the permanent terminus in the city and Vauxhall became a goods-only station until it was rebuilt and opened in 1869 under the London &amp; North Western Railway (LNWR). The Curzon Street station entrance hall remains today in its original form, designed by Philip Hardwick, mirroring his design of the Euston Arch at the London terminus of the railway line. It is Grade I listed and is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving piece of monumental railway architecture. It closed to all railway traffic in 1966.

New Street station opened in 1854, and Curzon Street station fell out of passenger use, running only holiday excursions for the public. New Street helped by becoming a hub for railway lines, easing connections between them. Despite this, an extension of New Street station was required in the 1880s so that Midland Railway trains between Derby and Bristol no longer needed to use Camp Hill railway station which opened in 1840.
Snow Hill station was the next major station to open in Birmingham, opening in 1852 as Livery Street station. It connected London Paddington to Wolverhampton Low Level. The station was rebuilt in 1871 to accommodate longer trains and again between 1906 and 1912. The latter scheme was undertaken so that the station could compete better with New Street. Other stations on the line in Birmingham were Soho &amp; Winson Green and Hockley. To alleviate pressure on Snow Hill, Moor Street station was opened in 1909 as a terminus for the North Warwickshire lines. The two stations were linked by tunnel which closed in 1968, only to be reopened in 1987 under British Rail, when the new Moor Street station was completed. The 1960s Beeching cuts stated Snow Hill station as being unnecessary and the station closed in 1972 along with the line to Wolverhampton Low Level. The station was demolished by 1977, with only the original gates and booking hall sign surviving. However, in the 1980s, British Rail decided to re-open Snow Hill station as part of the cross-city transport plan for Birmingham. It reopened in 1987 as part of a completely redeveloped site with new office buildings replacing the original hotel, and multi-storey car parking over the station concourses. In 2011 a new station entrance was opened linking Snow Hill station to the Jewellery Quarter, on the other side of the A41 Queensway inner distribution road.
In 1986, Moor Street was relocated adjacent to the original station. However, in 2002, the original Moor Street station was renovated by the Birmingham Alliance and Chiltern Railways at a cost of £11 million, and converted into a shopping and refreshment area connected to the new platforms.

The Harborne Branch Line opened in 1875, connecting New Street to the outlying suburb of Harborne. A connection to the LNWR was created at Monument Lane. The branch terminated at Harborne railway station. The line began to suffer from falling passenger numbers, largely due to the increasing popularity of buses but also due to train delays as a result of congestion of routes at New Street station. Icknield Port Road station closed in 1931, and the other stations closed to passengers on 26 November 1934. The last passenger train to run on the line was an enthusiasts&#x27; special on 3 June 1950. The line closed to freight traffic on 4 November 1963.

In 1978 the Cross-City Line came into being, comprising the former Midland Railway line between Redditch and New Street via Selly Oak and the London and North Western Railway Line between New Street and Lichfield. It connects Sutton Coldfield, which was absorbed into Birmingham in 1974, with the Birmingham city centre. This line provides the only passenger service to Sutton Coldfield; the Sutton Park Line, opened in 1879 and closed to passengers in 1965, is still in use as a freight-only line avoiding central Birmingham.

===Mainline services===

A large number of railway lines meet at Birmingham New Street railway station, which is a hub of the UK rail network and is the calling point for most intercity services to and from Birmingham. Trains to London Marylebone operated by Chiltern Railways stop at Moor Street station, and most continue to Snow Hill station.

New Street Station has been redeveloped in a £500 million scheme named Gateway Plus. The project improved passenger facilities and increased passenger capacity at the station, which had been running at over double its capacity. The first stage of the development was completed in April 2013, when the old concourse was closed. The project was completed in 2015.

Phase One of High Speed 2 is to have its first spur to Birmingham linking with London. Phase Two will create new high speed links from Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester. Since New Street does not have sufficient capacity for the new high-speed trains, a new dedicated high-speed railway station will be built at Curzon Street, partly on the site of the former station, and adjacent to Moor Street. A new station called Birmingham Interchange will be opened adjacent to Birmingham International to serve the city&#x27;s airport and the National Exhibition Centre.

===Local services===
There is a network of rail services within Birmingham and the West Midlands county, operated by West Midlands Trains and supported by Transport for West Midlands (TfWM) (formerly called Centro). During 2014/15, there were nearly 51 million rail passenger journeys in the TfWM area. Birmingham has the highest proportion of rail commuters in England outside London. In the past few decades the proportion of journeys into central Birmingham by rail has grown sharply: 27% of journeys into Birmingham city centre in the peak hours were made by rail in 2012, compared to 17% in 2001, and 12% in 1991.

Most of the Birmingham and West Midlands County local commuter lines are centred on New Street station, including the Cross-City Line, the Chase Line and the Coventry-Wolverhampton Line. Three commuter routes, known collectively as the Snow Hill Lines, run through Snow Hill and Moor Street stations.

Plans are being pursued to restore local passenger services to the Camp Hill line in southern Birmingham, which is currently freight only, by constructing new chords into Birmingham Moor Street station. This would also allow for new local services on the lines from Birmingham to and .

==Light Rail==
===West Midlands Metro===
The West Midlands Metro is a light-rail tram system promoted by TfWM. The system currently has one line which connects Birmingham to Wolverhampton via West Bromwich and Wednesbury. The original line from Wolverhampton to Birmingham Snow Hill was opened in 1999. In 2016, the line was extended across Birmingham city-centre from Birmingham Snow Hill to Birmingham New Street station, subsequently extended to Centenary Square with work in hand as of 2021 to continue the line on to Five Ways and Edgbaston, and on another line connecting to the Eastside of the city-centre. There are long-term plans to extend the system across Birmingham and the West Midlands. 3 new lines to Brierley Hill, Digbeth and Birmingham Airport are under construction. With more lines receiving £1.7bn in funding to Walsall, Stourbridge, Quinton, Wednesfield, Solihull and New Cross Hospital that are currently in development / planning.

===Birmingham Corporation Tramways===

Birmingham Corporation Tramways operated a network of tramways in Birmingham from 1904 until 1953. It was the largest narrow-gauge tramway network in the UK, and was built to a gauge of . It was the fourth largest tramway network in the UK behind London, Glasgow and Manchester.

==Underground system==
In the early 1950s, the government planned to protect essential communications by building a series of hardened underground telephone exchanges. Construction of the Anchor exchange in Birmingham started in 1953 with a cover story that a new underground rail network was being built. Work progressed until 1956 when the public were told the project was no longer economic; instead Birmingham got its underpasses through the city to help relieve congestion. An underground exchange and tunnel system 100 ft below Newhall Street had been completed at a cost £4 million. The main tunnel runs from Anchor to Midland ATE in Hill Street, from there the tunnel continued under New Street Station and on to the exchange in Essex Street.

More recently, the Conservative–Lib-Dem alliance running Birmingham City Council proposed an underground system as an alternative to expansion of the Midland Metro. A£150,000 feasibility study was conducted, looking at the benefits and drawbacks of a state-of-the-art, £3 billion underground system serving the city. Upon the outcome of the report, the city council backed plans for a street metro system.

==Buses and coaches==
Birmingham has a wide bus network. 84% of public transport use in the West Midlands is by bus. There are approximately 50 operators of registered local bus services in the West Midlands. The largest bus operator in the area is National Express West Midlands, which accounts for over 80% of all journeys. The company changed its name from Travel West Midlands in 2008 as a part of National Express&#x27; re-branding. National Express West Midlands operates a large network based on a range of services radiating out of Birmingham City Centre and the route 11 bus service, the longest urban bus service in Europe which chiefly follows the A4040 circular road.

Most of the network is operated on a commercial basis, with some services (usually evenings and Sundays) supported by TfWM. Smaller operators provide a range of services, either in competition with National Express West Midlands or under contract to TfWM. These include Diamond West Midlands and The Green Bus. Medium distance bus services from Birmingham include First Midland Red operating services to Worcester and Redditch. Arriva Midlands operates services to Tamworth and Kingsbury in Staffordshire. Johnsons Coach &amp; Bus Travel operate longer distance bus services from the south of the conurbation such as the 20 to Stratford-upon-Avon and the 150/X50 to Redditch.

Despite the large number of buses serving Birmingham City Centre there is no longer a bus station. Instead buses terminate at bus stops on roads surrounding the city centre which are given codes assigned by area (e.g. Moor Street Interchange = MS*). The airport can also be reached via an express bus service from Coleshill Parkway station, on the Birmingham to Peterborough Line which run four times per hour and take around fifteen minutes. Alternatively, National Express Coventry runs a regular bus service from the City Centre. The number X1 from Moor Street Queensway to Coventry runs via the airport and the National Exhibition Centre.

Birmingham is also a major hub in the National Express coach network, whose headquarters are in Birmingham. The group operates services from its hub at Birmingham coach station, a new coach station on the site of the former Digbeth coach station. A temporary coach station was located in nearby Oxford Street whilst building work was undertaken. The company&#x27;s flagship NXL Shuttle service operates services to London with frequent services to all major airports and cities in Britain. Many of these are cross-country services operating from north to south, for which Birmingham provides interchange facilities. Birmingham is also served by Megabus coaches that stop at Brunel Street, west of New Street station.

==Roads==

The M40 motorway connects to London via Oxford. The M6 motorway also connects Birmingham to London (via the M1) and the south, and the north-west of England and Scotland. Junction 6 of the M6 is also one of Birmingham&#x27;s landmarks, and probably the most notable motorway junction in the UK, Spaghetti Junction, which is officially called the Gravelly Hill Interchange. Other motorways are: 
* The A38(M) which links Spaghetti Junction to the city centre
*The M5, connecting Birmingham to the south-west of England
*The M42, which connects Birmingham to Tamworth and the East Midlands
*The M6 Toll, which enables through traffic on the M6 to bypass Birmingham and Wolverhampton.

Birmingham, unlike London and Manchester, does not have a single orbital motorway. Instead, three motorways form a box which surrounds most of the city. These are:
*The M42 which forms the southern and eastern sections. In the middle, the M40 terminates, which has its junction built with priority for traffic going from the M40 to the M42 west, instead of M42 east-west priority. The M40 goes off south to Warwick, Oxford, High Wycombe, Uxbridge and London.
*The M5 which forms the western section.
*The M6 which forms the northern section. The M5 terminates on the M6.

Other major roads passing through Birmingham include:
*The A34 from Manchester to Winchester
*The A38 from Mansfield to Bodmin
*The A41 from London to Birkenhead
*The A45 from Birmingham to Thrapston (formerly to Felixstowe)
*The A47 from Birmingham to Great Yarmouth
*The A4540 &#x27;Middleway&#x27; ring road
*The A4040 Outer Ring Road

===Clean Air Zone===

Birmingham introduced a Clean Air Zone on 1 June 2021, which charges polluting vehicles to travel into the city centre (all roads within the A4540 ring road). Poor air quality kills around 900 people a year in Birmingham and the government has ordered the city to reduce pollution. The daily charge is £8 for petrol cars built before 2006 and diesel cars built before 2015, and £50 for lorries and coaches. The money is used to improve public transport.

===Cycling===
Sustrans&#x27; National Cycle Route 5 goes through central Birmingham, connecting with National Cycle Route 81 at Smethwick. National Cycle Route 535 from Sutton Coldfield terminates just north of Birmingham Snow Hill railway station.

In 2021, Transport for West Midlands launched a cycle hire scheme involving over 300 bikes and 43 docking stations across the West Midlands, including central Birmingham. Dedicated cycling infrastructure remains relatively scarce in suburban areas of Birmingham.

==Air==
===History===

Birmingham&#x27;s first airport was Castle Bromwich Aerodrome, which operated from 1909 to 1958. Another opened as Elmdon Airport on 8 July 1939 and continues to operate, as Birmingham Airport. A heliport, Hay Mills Rotor Station, operated passenger services to London from 1951 to 1952, with freight flights continuing until 1954. Another operated adjacent to Baskerville House in the 1950s.

===Current===
Birmingham is served by Birmingham Airport in the Borough of Solihull to the east of Birmingham, which is the seventh-busiest (2013) by passenger traffic in the UK. The airport is served by the railway network at Birmingham International railway station, nearby in the same Borough. The airport and railway station are linked by the AirRail Link, originally a Maglev system, since converted to a cable-hauled SkyRail people mover. Train services are provided by Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains.

Bus services operate from the airport to Coleshill Parkway railway station on the Birmingham – Leicester railway line. This link improves access to the East Midlands as well as providing further links to North Warwickshire and South-east Staffordshire.

The airport has two major bus services running into Birmingham: the X1 (Birmingham – Airport – Coventry), which operates 24 hours a day and X12 bus (Birmingham - Chelmsley Wood– Airport – Solihull). The majority of bus services from the airport are run by National Express West Midlands (formerly known as Travel West Midlands) with other Warwickshire-funded services such as the 75.
==Canals==
Birmingham&#x27;s canal network was built during the Industrial Revolution to transport heavy goods and the city remains at the hub of the country&#x27;s canal network. Canals run for within the city, of which most are still navigable. Birmingham is often lauded as having more miles of canal than Venice, true by a margin of . Birmingham however includes many semi-urban parts and is a far larger city than Venice making for a much lower canal density (concentration). The type of waterway is inland providing the main access to few properties. This contrasts to Venice&#x27;s broad coastal canals providing the main means of access, surrounded by a lagoon of the Adriatic Sea. By water volume (taking into account depths), Birmingham has more cubic metres of water in its canals than any other city in the world.

Extensive regeneration of canals has taken place since the 1980s, including dredging to enable the smooth passage of narrowboats, reconstruction and construction of canalside housing. 2010s developments include the Eastside area of Digbeth and the area within Icknield Port Loop.

Canals in Birmingham include:
* Birmingham Canal Navigations network, including the BCN Main Line and the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal
* Worcester &amp; Birmingham Canal (parts of)
* The Grand Union Canal (parts of)

Birmingham has reservoirs to feed its canals, including:
*Edgbaston Reservoir
*Lifford Reservoir

There are no navigable rivers: the Rea, on which the city was founded, is little more than a culverted stream, and the Tame, which passes through some northern suburbs, is not navigable. The River Cole, which runs through the south-east of the city through to the north-west, is too shallow for anything bigger than a raft.

==Birmingham public transport statistics==

The average time which public transport users in Birmingham spend commuting per day (as such, chiefly to and from work) on a weekday is 94minutes; 38% of such users commute for more than 120minutes. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transport is 11minutes. The average distance people ride in a trip with public transport is ; 10% of users travel more than in any leg of their public transport journey per day.

<doc id="654753" wikidata="Q7495446" url="?curid=654753" title="Sherston trilogy">
<text>The Sherston trilogy is a series of books by the English poet and novelist Siegfried Sassoon, consisting of &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of an Infantry Officer&quot;, and &quot;Sherston&#x27;s Progress&quot;. They are named after the protagonist, George Sherston - a young Englishman of the upper middle-class, living immediately before and during the First World War.

The books are, in fact, &#x27;fictionalised autobiography&#x27;, wherein the only truly fictional things are the names of the characters. Sassoon himself is represented by Sherston. A comparison of the Sherston memoirs to Sassoon&#x27;s later, undiluted autobiographical trilogy (&quot;The Old Century&quot;, &quot;The Weald of Youth&quot;, and &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Journey&quot;) shows their strict similarity, and it is generally accepted that all six books constitute a composite portrait of the author, and of his life as a young man. (Sassoon remarked, however, that his alter-ego personified only one-fifth of his actual personality. Unlike his author, Sherston has no poetic inclinations; nor does he deal with homosexuality, which was illegal at the time Sassoon was writing.)

The Sherston trilogy won high acclaim, and &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&quot; took the Hawthornden Prize for Literature for 1928. The three books were printed together in one volume, &quot;The Memoirs of George Sherston&quot;, in 1937.

Adding all two-digit permutation subsets of 132 yields the same number: 
:formula_1. 

132 is the smallest number in decimal with this property, which is shared by 264, 396 and 35964 (see digit-reassembly number).

The number of irreducible trees with fifteen vertices is 132.

In a formula_2 toroidal board in the &quot;n&quot;–Queens problem, 132 is the count of non-attacking queens, with respective indicator of 19 and multiplicity of 1444 = 382 (where, 2 × 19 = 38).

The exceptional outer automorphism of symmetric group &quot;S&quot;6 uniquely maps vertices to factorizations and edges to partitions in the graph factors of the complete graph with six vertices (and fifteen edges) &quot;K&quot;6, which yields 132 blocks in Steiner system S(5,6,12).

<text>Winsor Harmon (born November 22, 1963) is an American actor best known for his role as Thorne Forrester on the American soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. He took over the role from Jeff Trachta in December 1996 and stayed with the show for 20 years. He briefly returned to the role in March 2022 and in December 2023.

==Career==
Harmon portrayed Del Henry on the program &quot;All My Children&quot; from 1994 to 1995. He has made appearances on &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot; and &quot;Acapulco H.E.A.T.&quot;. Harmon told &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; about his guest stint on &quot;H.E.A.T.&quot;: &quot;I hung out with John McCook the whole time and I kept watching all these people from other countries asking for his autograph. I&#x27;m thinking to myself, &#x27;Who the hell is this guy?&#x27; So one night, we were drinking Coronas and I asked him why he had so many fans and he explained how &quot;B&amp;B&quot; was so popular around the world. I had no idea. The more he talked about it, the more I was thinking, &#x27;I want to be on that show.&#x27;... The first time I drove into the parking lot, there was John, just pointing at me and laughing. He asked what I was doing here and I told him that I was Thorne. That&#x27;s when he told me that he was going to be playing my dad. That was just too wild.&quot;

Before acting, Harmon was employed as a model with Ford Models.

==Personal life==
Born in Louisiana, Harmon attended Rockwall High School in Rockwall, Texas, and graduated in 1982. He went on to study at Texas A&amp;M University on a football scholarship. Harmon was one of the first to know that Mark Consuelos and co-star Kelly Ripa were dating and had secretly gotten married in Las Vegas.

<doc id="654769" wikidata="Q5191921" url="?curid=654769" title="Cub Scouts (Scouting America)">
<text>Cub Scouts is a Scouting America program available to coeducational children from kindergarten through fifth grade (or 5 to 10 years of age) and their families. Its membership is the largest of the five main Scouting America divisions (Cub Scouting, Scouts BSA, Venturing, Exploring and Sea Scouting). Cub Scouts is part of the worldwide Scouting movement and aims to promote character development, citizenship training, personal fitness, and leadership. Cub Scouts are organized into local packs where they complete requirements to advance in rank as well as engage in pack events such as the Pinewood Derby.

==Origins==
As early as 1911, Ernest Thompson Seton had developed a prototype program he named &quot;Cub Scouts of America&quot; that was never implemented. James E. West felt that having BSA divisions for younger boys (those under 12; the &quot;younger boy problem&quot;) would draw away boys from the core program, which was Scout troops focused on the 12- to 17-year-old age group; thus he opposed such a program for some time. In spite of this, unofficial programs for younger boys started around this time, under names such as &quot;Junior Troops&quot; or &quot;Cadet Corps&quot;. The BSA obtained the rights to Lord Baden-Powell&#x27;s &quot;The Wolf Cub&#x27;s Handbook&quot; in 1916 and used it in unofficial Wolf Cub programs starting in 1918. This led to an issue with Daniel Carter Beard who felt that the use of the British book was nearly disloyal to the United States of America. West encouraged the formation of the Boy Rangers of America, a separate organization for boys eight through twelve based on an American Indian theme. The Boy Rangers used the Scout Law and their Chief Guide, Emerson Brooks, was a Boy Scout commissioner in Montclair, New Jersey. The BSA finally began some experimental Cub units in 1928 and in 1930 the BSA began registering the first Cub Scout packs, and the Boy Rangers were absorbed.

The British Cubbing program used elements of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Book&quot; series, with the Cubmaster taking the role of Akela and the assistant Cubmaster the role of Baloo. The American program also syncretized American Indian elements, with all Cub Scouts belonging to the Webelos tribe, symbolized by the Arrow of Light and led by Akela. &quot;Webelos&quot; was also a portmanteau meaning &quot;Wolf, Bear, Lion, Scout&quot;; the name was later given a backronym of &quot;WE&#x27;ll BE LOyal Scouts&quot;. The initial rank structure was Wolf, Bear and Lion, with ages of 9, 10 and 11. Dens of six to eight Cubs were entirely led by a Scout holding the position of den chief.

==Aims, methods, and purposes==
The Aims of Cub Scouting are the same as the other divisions—character, citizenship, personal fitness, and leadership.

==Ideals==
On June 1, 2015, the Cub Scout Promise and the Law of the Pack were retired and replaced by the Scout Oath and Scout Law. The Cub Scout Motto continues to be used.


The Cub Scout sign, two raised fingers of the right hand, identifies the youth as a Cub Scout and the two fingers stand for the Scout Oath and Law. The Cub Scout salute, two fingers of the right hand raised to the edge of the cap or eyebrow, is used to show respect for the country when saluting the flag of the United States. The Cub Scout handshake, first two fingers along the inside of the other Scout&#x27;s wrist, is used to help each other remember and obey the Scout Oath and Law.

==Organization==

The Cub Scout pack is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group or religious institution. The chartered organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the liaison between the pack, the chartered organization, and the BSA.

The pack meets once a month, providing a program for Cub Scouts, leaders, parents and other family members attending. The pack is led by a Cubmaster with one or more assistant Cubmasters. The pack committee is a group of adults, led by the pack committee chair, who plan the pack program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment and registration. The pack trainer is responsible for ensuring that all of the pack leaders are trained and for maintaining training records.

Cub Scouts who join a pack are assigned to dens with ideally six to eight members, usually based on age: Lion Scouts (kindergarten), Tiger Scouts (first grade), Wolf Scouts (second grade), Bear Scouts (third grade), Webelos Scouts (fourth grade), and Arrow of Light Scouts (fifth grade). Dens meet weekly or biweekly under the direction of the adult den leader. A Cub Scout is elected to the Denner position to provide basic leadership to the den. A Scout or Venturer holding the den chief position may assist the den leader in activities. Den meetings are planned around a particular adventure being worked on for rank advancement and may include games, handicrafts, hikes and other outdoor fun while also preparing for the next pack meeting.

Webelos is an acronym meaning &quot;We&#x27;ll Be Loyal Scouts&quot;. According to the &quot;Bear Cub Scout Book&quot; of 1954, the name originally came from the initial letters of &quot;wolf, bear, lion, Scout&quot;, the rank of &quot;Lion Cub Scout&quot; was dropped in 1967, however was used again in 2017 with the launch of the pilot kindergarten program of the same name which became a full-fledged part of the program in 2018. AOL dens spend much of their time learning about Scout customs, including the Scout Law and Oath. Many packs are formally associated with a Scout troop for mutual support—the troop provides assistance to the pack with activities such as campouts and ceremonies and in time, the AOL Scouts cross over to the troop.

The Lone Cub Scout program serves youth who cannot take part in a nearby Cub Scout pack on a regular basis because of such factors as distance, weather, time, disability or similar issues.

In October 2017, Scouting America announced that girls would be welcomed into the Cub Scout program in single gender dens but co-ed packs. 77,000 girls joined nationwide creating packs in California, among other places.

In April 2023, Scouting America announced that effective June 1, 2023, co-ed dens (aka family dens) would now be allowed for Cub Scouts in Kindergarten through 4th Grade (Lions through Webelos). AOL dens for 5th graders would remain single-gender dens in order to prepare them for single-gender Scouts BSA troops. However, some councils are now getting ready to pilot mixed-gender Scouts BSA troops for a one year initial trial.

==Uniform==

The uniform gives a Cub Scout visibility and creates a level of identity within both the unit and the community. The neckerchief, the neckerchief slide and the belt buckle uniforms are similar in basic design, they do vary in color and detail to identify the different divisions of Cub Scouts, Scouts and Venturers. In all cases, shirts are tucked in.

===Youth uniforms===
Lions have the option of two uniforms to wear; each Lion den will separately decide which uniform they as a den will wear.

* Option A is the Cub Scout uniform, accompanied by a yellow Lion neckerchief and Lion slide, the blue Cub Scout belt, a blue cap with lion logo, and blue socks topped with yellow. Scouts can wear blue pants, blue shorts, or blue skorts, as appropriate.
* Option B is the official Lion t-shirt which has the lion logo on it, but without the neckerchief or slide. The t-shirt can also be accompanied by the same hat, belt, socks, and pants, shorts, or skorts.

Tigers wear the Cub Scout uniform, accompanied by yellow-topped blue socks, an orange neckerchief, neckerchief slide with the Tiger logo, the cap with an orange panel and Tiger emblem and the blue Cub Scout belt. Scouts can wear blue pants, blue shorts, or blue skorts, as appropriate.

Wolves wear the Cub Scout uniform and the Wolf cap with red panel and Wolf logo and the red Wolf neckerchief and the neckerchief slide with Wolf logo. The yellow Wolf cap and yellow neckerchiefs are no longer sold at most council shops, but are still allowed to be worn instead of the red. Wolves also wear the Cub Scout belt and blue socks topped with a ring of yellow. Scouts can wear blue pants, blue shorts, or blue skorts, as appropriate.

Bears wear the Cub Scout uniform and a cap with light blue panel with Bear logo. The light blue neckerchief and the neckerchief slide have the Bear logo. Bears also wear the Cub Scout belt and blue socks topped with a ring of yellow. Scouts can wear blue pants, blue shorts, or blue skorts, as appropriate.

Webelos typically wear the Cub Scout uniform, with one unique addition being the Adventure colors ribbons worn on the right sleeve to hold the pins they earn. The Webelos cap is green with a plaid panel and the oval Webelos emblem; the plaid is made up of the Cub Scouting blue and gold and the Scouts BSA red and green. The neckerchief is plaid with the Webelos logo and is worn with the slide with Webelos emblem. Webelos also wear the Cub Scout belt and blue socks topped with a ring of yellow. Scouts can wear blue pants, blue shorts, or blue skorts, as appropriate. Starting in 4th grade, parents are given discretion as to when to have their Scout begin wearing the Scouts BSA field uniform. If a Webelos Scout has outgrown their blue uniform, it is appropriate for them to acquire and wear a tan Scouts BSA uniform instead rather than acquiring a new blue Cub Scout uniform for just a short window of time.

Arrow of Light Scouts wear the Scouts BSA field uniform with blue shoulder loops. The AOL Scouts no longer wear the Webelos cap or neckerchief; AOL Dens can choose to either go without both or can wear the Scouts BSA hat and neckerchief. AOL Scouts wear the green Scouts BSA belt and green Scouts BSA socks. The AOL den may elect to wear a den emblem in place of the den number; the patches are the same as the Scout patrol patches.

===Scouter uniforms===
Adult leaders wear the basic Scout field uniform. Female leaders of dens below Webelos level have the option of the classic female Cub Scouter uniform with blue web belt. Leaders that wear the tan uniform shirt wear blue shoulder loops on the epaulets, Centennial or Switchbacks pants or shorts, and the Scout web or leather belt. They may wear the Cub Scout Leader neckerchief or any official BSA neckerchief, with the appropriate neckerchief slide or woggle. Leaders may wear any official BSA adult hat.

The Scouter dress uniform is appropriate for professional Scouters and all Scouting leaders on formal occasions.

==Advancement and recognition==

Advancement is one of the methods used to promote the aims of character development, citizenship training, personal fitness, and leadership. Everything a Cub Scout does in the advancement program is intended to achieve these aims and aid in personal growth. On June 1, 2015, Cub Scouting changed the advancement system to an &quot;adventure&quot; system, including required and elective adventures for all ranks. Lion, Tiger, Wolf, and Bear Cubs earn activity belt loops for each completed adventure, while Webelos earn activity pins which can be worn on the cap or on the Webelos colors.

On June 1, 2024, Cub Scouts reworked all of the ranks to harmonize and simplify the adventure system. Each rank now has six required adventures and requires the additional completion of two elective adventures. Lion and Arrow of Light have 16 elective adventures to choose from and Tiger, Wolf, Bear, and Webelos all have 20 electives.

Bobcat is no longer a rank that is earned when a Cub Scout first joins, but rather is the first required adventure that should be completed as part of each rank.

===Lion badge===
Kindergartners work toward the Lion badge. The Lion badge is earned by completing six required adventures and two elective adventures. Outside of the requirements, Lion Scouts can also complete any number of sixteen elective adventures of their den&#x27;s or family&#x27;s choosing. The Lion badge is the most recent addition to Cub Scouts as it was introduced in 2018.

===Tiger, Wolf, Bear, and Webelos badges===
Cub Scouts in first grade work toward the Tiger badge, while those in second grade work toward the Wolf badge, those in third grade work toward the Bear badge, and those in fourth grade work toward the Webelos badge. Cub Scouts at all four levels must complete six required adventures and two of 20 elective adventures with their den or family, as well as completing age-specific exercises to help prevent child abuse with their family. The abuse prevention requirements must be completed annually. The remaining elective adventures may be completed throughout the rest of the school year.

===Arrow of Light badge===

The Arrow of Light badge is the highest rank award available to Cub Scouts. To earn the Arrow of Light, the Cub Scout must complete six required adventures, two of 16 elective adventures, and child abuse prevention exercises. Earning the Arrow of Light allows a youth to join a Scout troop at ten years of age instead of eleven. The adventure curriculum for AOL Scouts is shorter than that of Webelos Scouts in order to accommodate the fact that AOL Scouts will traditionally bridge to a Scouts BSA troop between January and March of their fifth grade school year. The requirements for the Arrow of Light badge prepare the AOL Scouts for Scouts BSA without significantly repeating the requirements for the first rank in Scouts BSA, Scout. The AOL handbook also includes pages from the Scouts BSA handbook for the Scout rank so that families do not have to purchase two handbooks in the same year.

The Arrow of Light award is one of the few Cub Scout awards that can be worn on a Scout uniform. Both Cub Scouts and Scouts wear the Arrow of Light badge below the left pocket. Adults wear the square-knot version of the badge above the left pocket.

===Religious emblems===

Several religious emblems programs are administered by various religious institutions and recognized, but not sponsored, by Scouting America. These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered square knot that can also be worn on the Scouting uniform.

===Leader recognition===
Cub Scout leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Den Leader Award, the Scouter&#x27;s Training Award, and the Cubmaster&#x27;s Training Key are available. These awards were standardized to more closely align with Scouts BSA&#x27;s other programs in 2012, removing most of the distinctive Cub Scout level awards such as Tiger Cub Den Leader&#x27;s Training Award (discontinued December 2012), the Webelos Den Leader&#x27;s Training Award (discontinued December 2012), the Cubmaster&#x27;s Training Award (discontinued December 2013), the Cub Scouter&#x27;s Training Award (discontinued December 2013), and the Pack Trainer Award (discontinued December 2013). The Scouter&#x27;s Training Award replaced the Cub Scouter Award, and the Cubmaster&#x27;s Training Key replaced the Cubmaster&#x27;s Training Award. The Pack Trainer Award had previously replaced the Den Leader Coach Award, which was officially discontinued on December 31, 2008. Any awards earned prior to the date of their retirement can still be worn. These awards are recognized by a certificate, medal, and an embroidered square knot insignia. Den Chiefs may earn the Den Chief Service Award.

==Program and activities==
Each pack has a number of annual events such as the pinewood derby, raingutter regatta, the space derby, gold rush, the blue and gold banquet and Scout Sunday or Scout Sabbath.

Several structured camping activities are available in the Cub Scout program. The pack overnighter is a pack-organized camping activity that provides Cub Scouts with positive outdoor experiences. Cub Scout day camp or twilight camp is an accredited, organized, one- to five-day program for Cub Scouts using trained leadership at an approved site, and is usually held during daylight or early evening hours, but not overnight. Cub Scout resident camp is an organized, accredited overnight camping program covering at least two nights and conducted under trained leadership in an established Scout camp operated by the council. The Webelos den overnight camp introduces the Scout and parents to the camping program, under the leadership of the Webelos den leader. Joint campouts with a local Scout troop for second-year Webelos can help to strengthen ties between the pack and troop and facilitate the transition from Webelos to Scouts.

The Soccer and Scouting program is designed to involve Hispanic youth and families in the Cub Scout program, instructing Scouts in both soccer and Cub Scout values.

Alcohol is prohibited at all Cub Scout events. A number of &quot;high-risk&quot; outdoor activities are banned by Scouting America (including Cubs), and others are limited to special programs. Paintball, lasertag, hunting, rodeo, fireworks, and bungee-jumping are among prohibited activities.

==Training==
Fast Start Training is the introduction for adult leaders new to the Cub Scout program. Fast Start is self-paced and provided as a video or online. Youth Protection Training is required for all adult leaders and must be recertified per local council policy. Basic Leader Training consists of the online This is Scouting course and Leader Specific Training. This is Scouting is a common core program for all adult leaders in the Cub Scouting, Scouts BSA, Varsity Scouting, and Venturing divisions. Leader Specific Training is provided for the Tiger Cub den leader, Cub Scout den leader, Webelos den leader, Cubmaster, pack committee chairman and assistants. Once Basic Leader Training is completed, the leader is awarded a Trained emblem for uniform wear.

At least one adult on a pack overnight campout must attend the Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation (BALOO) in order to properly understand camping requirements. Leaders for day camp and resident camp programs must be trained and certified by the National Camping School.

Supplemental training modules are designed to provide orientation beyond Basic Leader Training. These shorter training sessions are often provided at the Roundtable, a monthly meeting of leaders from the district, at a Pow-Wow or University of Scouting program offered by the local council and at National Cub Scouting Conferences held at the Philmont Scout Ranch and the Florida National High Adventure Sea Base.

Wood Badge is the advanced training program for leadership skills for all adults in all Scouting America programs. Wood Badge consists of six days of training (usually presented as two three-day weekends) and an application phase of several months. When training is complete, leaders are recognized with the Wood Badge beads, neckerchief and woggle.

Training is also provided for all new den chiefs.

==Notes==

:AWhile any religious emblem may be earned as a Cub Scout and worn as a Scout, these are administered and awarded by religious institutions and are not considered Scouting America awards as such.
:BNeck medallions were previously also awarded, but discontinued in 2001.

<doc id="654772" wikidata="Q272007" url="?curid=654772" title="Joan Van Ark">
<text>Joan Martha Van Ark (born June 16, 1943) is an American actress. She is best known for her role as Valene Ewing on the primetime soap opera &quot;Knots Landing.&quot; A life member of The Actors Studio, she made her Broadway debut in 1966 in &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;. In 1971, she received a Theatre World Award and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for the revival of &quot;The School for Wives&quot;.

In 1978, Van Ark landed her most famous role of Valene Ewing. The character first appeared on the CBS series &quot;Dallas&quot;, then was a leading character for 13 seasons on its spin-off &quot;Knots Landing&quot; (1979–92). For her performance on &quot;Knots Landing,&quot; she won the Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Actress in 1986 and 1989. She left the show in 1992, although she did return for the series&#x27; final two episodes in 1993 as well as the 1997 miniseries &quot;Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac&quot;. In 1985, she received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination as host of the &quot;Tournament of Roses Parade&quot; on CBS. From 2004 to 2005, she starred in the soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. She reprised her role of Valene in an episode of the new &quot;Dallas&quot; series in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Joan Martha Van Ark was born on June 16, 1943, in New York City to Dorothy Jean Van Ark (née Hemenway) (1917-1983) and Carroll Clement Van Ark (1897-1972). Van Ark&#x27;s father was an advertiser and public relations consultant, photographer and contributor to periodicals such as &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker.&quot; Carroll Van Ark&#x27;s paternal grandfather Gradus was an immigrant from The Netherlands who settled in Holland, Michigan. Both of Van Ark&#x27;s parents were also writers. After 1952, Van Ark grew up in Boulder, Colorado, with three siblings: Carol, Mark and Dexter. 

&quot;My dad was in PR in Denver. When I was 16, he arranged for her (Julie Harris) to speak with me. She ended up calling the dean of the Yale School of Drama, who agreed to meet with me. I became the second woman after Julie to be admitted when it was all men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo/130938251&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; - Joan Van Ark

At age 15 as a student reporter, Van Ark met and interviewed actress Julie Harris, who recommended that Van Ark apply to the Yale School of Drama, which Harris had attended in her early twenties. Van Ark followed in Harris&#x27; footsteps and went to Yale Drama on a scholarship. In 1964, Van Ark was one of the few acceptees to attend the Yale graduate program without first having earned an undergraduate degree. Van Ark was also reportedly the only female student on campus at the time. She attended for only one year. Years later, Harris appeared on &quot;Knots Landing&quot; as Lilimae Clements, the mother of Valene Ewing, Van Ark&#x27;s character.

After Harris died in 2013, Van Ark announced at a Broadway memorial service the creation of the Julie Harris Scholarship, which provides annual support to an actor studying at the Yale Drama School. Alec Baldwin, who played Harris&#x27; son and Van Ark&#x27;s brother on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, made the first contribution. In 2021, Yale Drama became tuition-free and was rebranded the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University.

==Career==
Van Ark began her professional career at the Guthrie Theater in Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Miser&quot; and appeared opposite Hume Cronyn and Zoe Caldwell. That was followed by &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; at the Guthrie with both Cronyn and Jessica Tandy. After a season at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., she originated the role of Corie in the national touring company of &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;, directed by Mike Nichols. In 1966, she recreated the role at the Piccadilly Circus in the critically acclaimed London Company when she replaced Marlo Thomas, who had pulled out due to a ligament injury; and later that same year, Van Ark made her Broadway debut as Corie at the Biltmore Theater and became one of the successors of Elizabeth Ashley, who three years earlier had appeared in the original Broadway production. 

Van Ark and her new husband moved to Los Angeles, where she started garnering television credits. In 1971, she revisited Broadway, where she earned a Theatre World Award and received a Tony nomination (Best Featured Actress in a Play) for her performance as Agnès in Molière&#x27;s &quot;The School for Wives,&quot; directed by Stephen Porter.

Van Ark starred opposite Ray Milland and Sam Elliott in the horror film &quot;Frogs&quot;, which was theatrically released on March 10, 1972.

After receiving a contract with Universal Studios, Van Ark co-starred with Bette Davis in &quot;The Judge and Jake Wyler&quot;, a 1972 two-hour telefilm and series pilot that failed to be picked up by NBC. Van Ark played the role of Erika in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in 1973 in the episode entitled &quot;Radar&#x27;s Report,” in which she rejects the prospect of marriage to Hawkeye (Alan Alda). Van Ark was also a regular cast member of the short-lived television sitcoms &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot; (1972–73) and &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Each Other&quot; (1977–78).

In 1974, Van Ark, tapped as a late replacement for Mary Ure, returned to Broadway as Silia Gala in a revival of Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;, which was performed by the New Phoenix Repertory Co. at the Helen Hayes Theater and also featured Glenn Close, who, in addition to playing a bit part as a neighbor, served as Van Ark&#x27;s understudy in the lead role of Silia. &quot;Game&quot; reunited Van Ark with &quot;School for Wives&quot; director Stephen Porter as well as &quot;Wives&quot; co-star David Dukes. In 1975, a production of &quot;Game&quot; was also broadcast on &quot;Great Performances&quot; as one of its &quot;Theatre in America&quot; selections&quot;.&quot;

Van Ark co-starred opposite Richard Boone in the science fiction outing &quot;The Last Dinosaur&quot;, which was filmed at Tsuburaya Studios in Tokyo and on location in the Japanese Alps. The picture was intended to be released theatrically but failed to find a distributor and instead aired as a TV movie in February 1977. 

In addition, Van Ark performed the voice of Spider-Woman in the short-lived 1979 animated series of the same name. 

After working for several years in a variety of guest roles on television, in 1978, she gained her best-known role as Valene Ewing (originally as a one-time appearance) on &quot;Dallas.&quot; Van Ark kept a tight schedule and was flying a lot the week of her &quot;Dallas&quot; debut, as &quot;Dallas&quot; was being filmed in Texas and she was simultaneously shooting an episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in L.A. and doing voiceover work for Estée Lauder in New York.

However, writers later worked the character into a couple of additional episodes; and in 1979, Van Ark then carried the Valene character over into the long-running spin-off, &quot;Knots Landing,&quot; in which she co-starred for thirteen of the show&#x27;s fourteen seasons. She left in 1992, although she did return for its final two episodes in May 1993. Her character was married three times to husband Gary Ewing, played in the series by Ted Shackelford; and during the show&#x27;s run, also had two other marriages: to Ben Gibson (Doug Sheehan) and Danny Waleska (Sam Behrens). 

During her thirteen years on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, Van Ark earned two Soap Opera Digest Awards for Best Actress (1986, 1989) and was nominated an additional six times. Over the course of the program, Van Ark probably received her greatest recognition as an actress during the sixth year, which featured an intricate storyline involving the theft of Valene&#x27;s twin babies. Their disappearance (and alleged stillborn deaths) provoked Valene to embark on a surreal spiritual journey and pilgrimage in which she left the cul-de-sac in California and morphed into the persona of a character from a novel she had written. 

&quot;The face-washing scene was an example of when I felt [a scene] couldn’t have gone better. It was everything we were all after. It became a monologue where I felt Valene should change and the audience should go with her on that journey. Of all the things I’ve ever done, I feel that that scene where Val washed her face was the deepest one. It was so rich. There was a combination of the cameraman, the writers, the producers, the director — they all allowed me that monologue in the mirror. We saw Valene become Verna right in front of our eyes.&quot; - Joan Van Ark 

This dark, gripping tale earned &quot;Knots Landing&quot; its only placement ever on Nielsen&#x27;s annual Top 10 programs list. In the 1984–1985 season finale, &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; Val finds out that her babies are still alive, and this episode&#x27;s original broadcast on May 23, 1985, also marked the only time &quot;Knots Landing&quot; ever reached the #1 spot in the weekly In its edition dated June 29, 1985, &quot;TV Guide&quot; assessed of her performance: &quot;&quot;Knots Landing&quot; has the grimmest plots but the strongest cast, headed by the incomparable Joan Van Ark as Valene.&quot; Later on, she directed two of the series&#x27; episodes, one in the last season after she was no longer a regular performer on the serial.

In 1985, she also co-hosted with Bob Barker CBS&#x27; &quot;Tournament of Roses Parade,&quot; which received a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Special Class Program. 

Mirroring their characters&#x27; onscreen friendship, Van Ark and &quot;KL&quot; co-star Michele Lee became good friends while working together on the series. In May 1997, Van Ark reprised her role of Valene Ewing in the CBS mini-series &quot;Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac;&quot; while in December 2005, she appeared in the non-fiction reunion &quot;Knots Landing Reunion: Together Again,&quot; in which she reminisced with the other cast members about the long-running CBS television show.

Shortly before leaving &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, she starred opposite Christopher Meloni in an ill-fated pilot called &quot;Spin Doctors&quot;, a sitcom for NBC that was not picked up. 

An &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot; called &quot;Boys Will Be Boys: The Ali Cooper Story&quot; (1994), which she appeared in and directed, was nominated for a Humanitas. In 1997, Van Ark also directed a documentary short on homelessness and domestic violence for the Directors Guild of America, and the piece was nominated for an Emmy Award.

She originated the role of Gloria Fisher Abbott on CBS television&#x27;s &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; from 2004 to 2005, then decided to leave the role and was replaced by Judith Chapman.

Van Ark also appeared Off-Broadway opposite John Rubinstein in &quot;Love Letters,&quot; as well as in Edward Albee&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize winning &quot;Three Tall Women&quot; at the Promenade Theatre and &quot;The Exonerated&quot; at the Bleecker Street Theatre. In 2000, she performed in &quot;Camino Real&quot; in Washington, D.C. 

Her Los Angeles theater credits include: &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; as Roxanne, as well as &quot;Ring Around the Moon&quot;, &quot;Chemin de Fer&quot;, &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot;, for which she won a Los Angeles Drama Critics Award. Opposite David Birney, she appeared as Lady Macbeth in the Grove Shakespeare Festival&#x27;s production of &quot;Macbeth,&quot; produced by Charles Johanson&quot;.&quot; 

Van Ark has also starred in three Williamstown Theatre Festival productions: &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1987), the 40th anniversary presentation of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Legend of Oedipus&quot; (1988), which is a five-hour, two-part adaptation by Kenneth Cavander of the classic Greek tragedies and was directed by WTF co-founder Nikos Psacharopoulos, who was also Van Ark&#x27;s acting professor when she was attending the Yale School of Drama.

Later stage work includes: her origination of the role of Mrs. Fenway in &quot;Escape,&quot; one of the newly discovered Tennessee Williams&#x27; shorts featured as part of the &quot;Five by Tenn&quot; collection at the Kennedy Center in 2004; the 2005 La Jolla Playhouse production of &quot;Private Fittings&quot;, directed by Des McAnuff, and a presentation of &quot;A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur&quot; in 2006 at the Hartford Stage.

Her TV movies include: &quot;With Harmful Intent&quot; opposite former Yale classmate Daniel J. Travanti and Rick Springfield as her husband Paul; &quot;My First Love&quot;, in which she plays the younger woman in a romantic triangle with Bea Arthur and Richard Kiley; &quot;Always Remember I Love You&quot; opposite Patty Duke; &quot;Moment of Truth: A Mother&#x27;s Deception&quot;; and based on the novel by Stuart M. Kaminsky, &quot;When the Dark Man Calls,&quot; in which she portrays a radio psychologist opposite Chris Sarandon as her brother Lloyd and James Read as Detective Lieberman.

Van Ark has also performed in a variety of guest roles, including on episodes of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, &quot;Petrocelli&quot;, &quot;Quincy&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, and &quot;Rhoda&quot; (in which she played the ex-wife of Rhoda&#x27;s husband). She appeared in three separate episodes of &quot;Medical Center&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot; and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, and four separate episodes of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In 1978, she also appeared in an episode of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; with Ted Shackelford, who would later become her onscreen husband Gary Ewing on both &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Knots Landing&quot;. Post-&quot;KL&quot; guest spots include: &quot;The Nanny&quot; and &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.&quot;

In April 2001, Van Ark was featured in an episode of the Howard Stern-produced show &quot;Son of the Beach&quot; as Ima Cummings, the mother of show regular BJ Cummings (played by Jaime Bergman). In 2008, she was reunited with her &quot;Knots Landing&quot; co-star Donna Mills in an episode of the FX drama series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;. The same year, she also played a network executive in the film &quot;Channels.&quot;

In April 2009, Van Ark appeared at the TV Land awards, where &quot;Knots Landing&quot; was being honored on its 30-year anniversary. Other &quot;Knots Landing&quot; actors who were present included Michele Lee, Donna Mills, Kevin Dobson, Ted Shackelford, Lisa Hartman Black, Constance McCashin, Don Murray and Michelle Phillips, along with &quot;Dallas&quot;/&quot;Knots Landing&quot; creator David Jacobs.

In 2011, she performed voice work in an episode of the animated comedy series &quot;Archer&quot;. In 2013, she guest-starred in an episode of the new &quot;Dallas&quot; series, in which she reprised the role of Valene Ewing. The same year, she also appeared as a guest judge on the Logo series &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;.

==Personal life==
On February 1, 1966, Van Ark married news reporter John Marshall, who later became a correspondent for two decades at KNBC-TV and won both an Emmy and a Golden Mike Award. Van Ark and Marshall were high school sweethearts in Boulder, Colorado, and wed in Trier, Germany, where Marshall was stationed at the time in the Armed Forces Television Service. For their honeymoon, they took a European tour of places made famous by her namesake, Joan of Arc.

The couple&#x27;s only child is voice actress, model, and singer Vanessa Marshall. In 1997, mother and daughter appeared together in the play &quot;Star Dust&quot; at the Tiffany Theater.

Van Ark is a long-distance runner who has participated in 14 marathons and made the cover of &quot;Runner&#x27;s World.&quot;

<text>William Foster Hayes III (June 5, 1925 – January 12, 2024) was an American actor and recording artist. His song &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot; hit the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts between March and May 1955.

Following a successful career as a musician that began in the late 1940s, Hayes began to focus on dramatic acting parts in the late 1960s, which led him to be cast in a role that gained him additional fame to a younger generation. This new chapter began in 1970 when he originated the character of Doug Williams on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;; the character&#x27;s final appearance on the program was streamed posthumously on Peacock on July 11, 2024.

==Early life==
Hayes was born in Harvey, Illinois, on June 5, 1925. He attended Whittier Grade School and Thornton Township High.

In March 1943, while a freshman at DePauw University, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy Air Corps, and received his welcome letter on his eighteenth birthday ordering him to report for active duty on July 1. For the next 27 months, he trained to be a fighter pilot. He was two weeks shy of receiving his commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Air Corps, scheduled to fly an F8F off a carrier, when World War II ended. He was awarded the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.

Given the choice of reenlisting in the Navy or getting out immediately, he opted for civilian life. After five weeks of hitchhiking around the Midwest to celebrate with buddies who were also coming home, he returned to complete his Bachelor of Arts requirements at DePauw University, where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and graduated in June 1947 with a dual major in Music and English.

== Career ==
Hayes was a singer on the Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca variety show &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; in the early 1950s. He had a supporting role in the 1952 black comedy &quot;Stop, You&#x27;re Killing Me&quot;. During the Davy Crockett craze in 1955, three recorded versions of &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot; were in the top 30. Hayes&#x27; version was the most popular: It was number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five weeks, sold over two million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. He also starred on Broadway in Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Me and Juliet&quot; (1953). Hayes had other small hits in the 1950s, including &quot;The Berry Tree&quot; and covers of &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;Wringle, Wrangle&quot;; the latter was his only other Hot 100 hit, reaching number 33 in 1957.

On &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, Hayes was introduced as a convict who was also a lounge singer. The character of Doug returned in 1986 and 1987 as well as 1993 and 1996. Later, he was on the show from 1999 onwards. His character was killed off in the spring of 2004 by Dr. Marlena Evans. In an elaborate plot hatched by head writer James E. Reilly, Doug turned up alive on a tropical island and went home to his wife.

In 2017, &quot;World by the Tail&quot;, a documentary about Bill Hayes&#x27;s life, was released online. On June 27, 2017, while present in the show&#x27;s audience, Hayes was featured in an impromptu interview on a web special for &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;; in his heyday, he had been a guest on the Johnny Carson-hosted version of the show.

==Personal life and death==
Hayes graduated from DePauw University with majors in music and English and became a member of Lambda Chi Alpha. Hayes earned a master&#x27;s degree in music from Northwestern University and a Ph.D. in education from West Virginia University.

Hayes was married to Mary Hobbs from 1947 to 1969; they had five children. He was then married to his &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; co-star Susan Seaforth Hayes, beginning in 1974. Their relationship was so popular that they were featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; in 1976, the only soap opera stars to hold that distinction to date. In 2005, the couple published their joint autobiography, &quot;Like Sands Through the Hourglass&quot;. The couple also supported the West Texas Rehab Center.

Hayes died in Studio City, Los Angeles on January 12, 2024, at age 98.

<doc id="654794" wikidata="Q549596" url="?curid=654794" title="Sean Kanan">
<text>Sean Kanan (; Perelman; born November 2, 1966) is an American actor, producer, and author, best known for his portrayals of Mike Barnes (in &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; and &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;), A. J. Quartermaine (on &quot;General Hospital&quot;), and Deacon Sharpe (on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;).

==Early life==
Kanan was born Sean Perelman in Cleveland, Ohio, to Dale and Michelle Perelman. His family later relocated to New Castle, Pennsylvania. He was raised Jewish. Kanan attended Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, Boston University and UCLA where he earned a degree in political science.

== Career ==
===&quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot;===
Kanan&#x27;s first notable role was that of villain Mike Barnes in the 1989 film &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; directed by Academy Award winning Director, John Avildsen.

As a teenager, Kanan studied Shotokan karate under Sensei William Stoner. By the time he landed the role, Kanan had a good foundation of Japanese Karate which would be essential for portraying the central villain opposite of hero Daniel LaRusso played by Ralph Macchio. He trained in Shitō-ryū at a school run by Karate master Fumio Demura and with stunt coordinator and Tang Soo Do master Pat E. Johnson.

During filming, he suffered internal bleeding after injuring his omentum, a membrane that connects the stomach with other organs, supplying them with blood along with physically protecting them. Kanan collapsed at a Las Vegas hotel four days after shooting the scene and underwent life-saving surgery.

===Television and film===
====1990–2000====
The following year, he starred on the Fox television series &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, Executive Produced by Francis Ford Coppola. In 1993, Kanan joined the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; as A. J. Quartermaine the troubled son of Dr. Alan and Dr. Monica Quartermaine. Kanan was nominated for an award in the Outstanding Newcomer category by &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; for his believable portrayal of the fictional character whose storylines often centered on an ongoing battle with alcoholism. He also appeared in an advertisement and campaign for the clothing company C&amp;A in 1994, the main theme was the culture of North American Indians, the advertisement was called Indian Spirits. The video was shot in San Francisco. He left the series in 1997 and returned in 2012 for the 50th anniversary of the show. Kanan&#x27;s last appearance was on April 23, 2014, after his on-screen television character was killed. In 1999, Kanan joined the cast of Aaron Spelling&#x27;s NBC soap opera &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; as Jude Cavanaugh and remained with the show until its cancellation later that year.

====2000–present====
In 2000 he joined the cast of the CBS soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; as Deacon Sharpe, playing a character that was originally conceived as a short-term villain, but would later prove to be the basis for a popular, on-going storyline for the show.He would remain with the show until 2005 when he opted for recurring status while his on-screen character served a prison sentence for obstructing justice. Kanan also starred in several feature films in tandem with his television career. He wrote and executive-produced &quot;Chasing Holden&quot;, which was distributed by Lionsgate,and starred Kanan along with DJ Qualls. In 2002 he hosted the Miss World Pageant in London, and in 2006 competed in the third season of Ballando con le Stelle, the Italian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

On July 10, 2009, Kanan reprised his role as Deacon Sharpe on the CBS sister soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. While appearing on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, he starred in the 2009 Indie film &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, which was directed by Julie Pacino (Al Pacino&#x27;s daughter) and was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. In May 2010, Kanan starred in &quot;My Trip to the Dark Side&quot;, written and directed by Shane Stanley. He later starred in the 2011 sequel &quot;My Trip Back to the Dark Side&quot;. Upon leaving &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in January 2012, Kanan reprised his role as Deacon Sharpe on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, but as of February 2024, he was taken off of the CBS web site for the cast of characters for the show, noting that Deacon is his favorite of all the characters he has played due in part to the writing of Bradley Bell.

=== &quot;Studio City&quot; ===
In 2019 Kanan created the Emmy Award-winning digital drama series &quot;Studio City&quot;, directed by Timothy Woodward Jr., as a somewhat autobiographical love letter to the Daytime Soaps.
Kanan stars as Sam Stevens, who portrays Dr. Pierce Hartley on the show-with-in-a show “Hearts on Fire”, along with Soap veterans Tristan Rogers, Carolyn Hennesy, Sarah Joy Brown, Patrika Darbo, and Scott Turner Schofield, the first openly transgender actor on Daytime TV. The episodes are penned by Kanan, along with Michele Kanan, Timothy Woodward Jr., and Lauren de Normandie (season one). The series explores issues like #meToo sexual harassment, ageism, gender identity and surprise paternity with enough levity to keep the story moving. &quot;Studio City&quot; was truly a family affair, with Kanan&#x27;s Emmy-nominated wife Michele Kanan writing / producing and her daughter (Sean&#x27;s step-daughter), Juliet Vega starring as Sam&#x27;s surprise love child. &quot;STUDiO CiTY&quot; is streaming on Amazon Prime.

In 2011, Kanan wrote &quot;The Modern Gentleman; Cooking and Entertaining with Sean Kanan&quot;, published by Dunham Books. He shared many of his favorite recipes, but also took the opportunity to help &quot;rebrand men&quot; by offering tips on etiquette, manners, and entertaining for special occasions. The goal of the book is to inspire people to be the best they can be, to get in touch with their authentic selves and to use cooking as a conduit for developing connections.

In 2019, the book &quot;Success Factor X&quot;, co-written by Kanan and motivational speaker Jill Liberman, was released. The book, published by Plain Sight Publishing, is described as a collection of strategies and secrets from a diverse group of high achievers ranging from billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban to hip-hop icons Run-DMC
In 2021, Sean wrote &quot;Way of the COBRA&quot; in which he, as Sensei, inspires and instructs students on techniques to define their most authentic and successful self. The acronym COBRA stands for character, optimization, balance, respect, and abundance. He shares some of his own experiences from landing the breakout role of Mike Barnes in the &quot;Karate Kid III&quot;, to how he almost lost the role and his life in the process. In 2024, Kanan co-authored the third book in the WOTC series titled Way of the COBRA Couples, with his wife Michele Kanan. 

=== Daytime Emmy and Walk of Fame ===
Kanan&#x27;s career has been acknowledged through numerous industry awards including the Daytime Emmy for his series STUDiO CiTY. In 2016, Kanan received the 400th star on the Walk of Fame in Palm Springs.

<doc id="654800" wikidata="Q232834" url="?curid=654800" title="Victoria Principal">
<text>Vicki Ree Principal (born January 3, 1950), later known as Victoria Principal, is an American actress, producer, entrepreneur, and author, best known for her role as Pamela Barnes Ewing on the American primetime television soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;. She spent nine years on the long-running series, leaving in 1987. Afterwards, she opened her own production company, Victoria Principal Productions, focusing mostly on television films. In the mid-1980s, she became interested in natural beauty therapies, and in 1989, she created an eponymous line of skincare products, Principal Secret.

Principal became a best-selling author, writing three books about beauty, skincare, fitness, well-being, and health: &quot;The Body Principal&quot; (1983), &quot;The Beauty Principal&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Diet Principal&quot; (1987). In the 2000s, she wrote a fourth book, &quot;Living Principal&quot; (2001). She is also a two-time Golden Globe Award nominee.

==Early life==
Vicki Ree Principal was born on January 3, 1950 in Fukuoka, Japan, the elder daughter of United States Air Force sergeant Victor Rocco Principal and Bertha Ree Principal (née Veal). She spent her first three months of life in Japan. 

Because her father was in the U.S. military, the family moved often. She grew up in London, Puerto Rico, Florida, Massachusetts, and Georgia, among other places. She attended 17 different schools, including the Royal Ballet School while her family was stationed in England.

Principal began her career in TV commercials, appearing in her first at age 5. After graduating from South Dade Senior High School in 1968, she enrolled at Miami–Dade Community College, intending to study medicine. However, months before completing her first year of studies, she was seriously injured in a car crash while driving home from the library. The other driver was convicted of drunk driving and served jail time. Principal spent months in recovery and was faced with the prospect of having to retake her first year of studies. After serious introspection, she drastically changed course by moving to New York City to pursue acting, and shortly thereafter to Europe. She studied privately with Jean Scott (professor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) in London, and in 1971 moved to Los Angeles.

==Career==
===Early acting===
Principal won her first film role as Marie Elena, a Mexican mistress, in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; (1972) (opposite Paul Newman), for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination as Most Promising Newcomer. On the basis of the positive response to Principal&#x27;s acting work, her role was enlarged by writer John Milius. During this period, Warren Cowan flew in, introduced himself to Principal, and offered to represent her free-of-charge for the next year. She went to Arizona as an unknown; when she returned to Los Angeles three months later, the commercial flight she was on was greeted by paparazzi. She then had a starring role in the risqué comedy film &quot;The Naked Ape&quot; (1973), which was co-financed by Hugh Hefner, the founder and publisher of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. She appeared nude in the September 1973 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; to promote the film. The film failed at the box office, which was a disappointment to her.

In 1974, she was cast in the blockbuster disaster film &quot;Earthquake&quot;. Principal won the supporting role of Rosa Amici, beating out both Susan Sarandon and Kay Lenz for the part. Prior to her third callback audition, she opted to cut her then waist-length brown hair, dye it black, and have it styled into an Afro. Director Mark Robson was stunned, but impressed by Principal&#x27;s risky transformation and dedication to look closer to the character. The film went on to become one of the era&#x27;s highest-grossing films and received four Academy Award nominations and two Golden Globe nominations. She continued to act in lesser-known films such as &quot;I Will, I Will... for Now&quot; and &quot;Vigilante Force&quot;. Principal signed a three-picture deal with Brute Productions.

===Behind the scenes, transition, and return to acting===
Principal decided to leave acting and became a Hollywood talent agent and booking agent, which was her profession from 1975 to late 1977. She then had ambitions to study at law school and would support herself if needed through small acting roles on television and film, so as to fund her future college tuition. In 1976, she returned to her character in &quot;Earthquake&quot; by shooting additional scenes to expand the running time of the original picture for the broadcast premiere of that film, and in 1977, she made a guest appearance on the pilot of the television series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; which aired on the ABC network, and in the 1977 television film &quot;The Night They Took Miss Beautiful&quot; on the NBC network.

The urge to return to acting came when television producer Aaron Spelling offered Principal a role in the pilot of his television series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, which she accepted.

===&quot;Dallas&quot; TV series===
When Principal obtained the pilot audition script for &quot;Dallas&quot;, her academic career ambitions changed, and she decided to return to the full-time acting profession. As Principal explained to TV Guide Network in 2004, &quot;I had left acting to be an agent and was on my way to law school, but when a friend dropped off a &quot;Dallas&quot; script, I read it. When I finished, I knew my life had changed - that part was mine. So I called the [casting] person and said, &quot;I&#x27;m sending someone in.&quot; She said, &quot;Who?&quot; I said, &quot;Just put down my name. It will be a surprise.&quot; And it certainly was a surprise - I showed up with me! I sent myself in for it!&quot; Principal landed the role of Pamela Barnes Ewing on the long-running prime time TV soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; that aired on the CBS network from 1978 to 1991. Principal explained to &quot;People&quot; in 2018, &quot;When I went in for the part on &quot;Dallas&quot;, I had already fallen in love with the show and with the part. So my feeling from the moment I read it was that it was incredibly special and that I really, really wanted to be a part of it. I could not imagine not being Pam.&quot; As Principal told &quot;TV Insider&quot; in 2018, &quot;I believed that &quot;Dallas&quot; would be a hit from the moment I read it. In fact, I turned down a major role that would have conflicted with &quot;Dallas&quot; in the belief that I would be offered the role of Pam. So that happened!&quot;

Principal was her own manager in contract negotiations with CBS and Lorimar Productions, which produced &quot;Dallas&quot;. When Principal signed her &quot;Dallas&quot; contract, she removed the clause that would have given the network the right to consent and profit from her outside endeavors. She explained, &quot;As a result that&#x27;s why, you can only notice in hindsight, I was the only person in the cast who did commercials, who was doing movies of the week, who wrote books and these all belong to me. I retained the control and ownership of my image. No one owns me.&quot;

&quot;Dallas&quot; became a global phenomenon with the 1980 &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot; cliffhanger mystery reveal. At the time, it was the highest-rated aired television episode in American history. Titled &quot;Who Done It&quot; the episode is the fourth episode in the fourth season (1980–1981) of &quot;Dallas&quot;, and remains the second highest rated prime-time telecast ever.

In 1981, Principal appeared on the song &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot; with her then boyfriend singer Andy Gibb. The single reached #51 on the US Hot 100 chart.

In 1983, Principal earned her second Golden Globe nomination, this time as Best Actress in a Television Series for &quot;Dallas&quot;. Principal took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons for a better Texas accent.

Principal&#x27;s character Pamela Ewing&#x27;s relationship with Patrick Duffy&#x27;s character, Bobby Ewing, was one of the major components of the series. Duffy&#x27;s character, however, was killed off. When Duffy returned to &quot;Dallas&quot; in 1986, after being killed off a year earlier, the entire previous year was written by the show&#x27;s writers as a dream that Pam had. Being told that the entire previous year was nothing more than a dream that one of the characters had didn&#x27;t go over very well with some of the show&#x27;s fans. Consequently, that season of &quot;Dallas&quot; is sometimes known as the show&#x27;s &quot;dream season&quot; as the entire ninth season was only Pam&#x27;s dream.

In 2018, recalling the first days of filming on the &quot;Dallas&quot; set in 1978, Principal told &quot;TV Insider&quot;, &quot;What I remember most about the first day of shooting &quot;Dallas&quot; was an unexpected feeling of &quot;déjà vu&quot;. Everything was new to me; I was nervous, and yet I felt strangely sure that I was where I was supposed to be and with the people I was supposed to be with as though this had happened before. I remember looking at Patrick [Duffy] when he did not know it and thinking, &#x27;this is a nice person.&#x27; And that made falling into his arms and our love scenes that day so much easier and natural.

Describing the on-screen relationship between Principal and Duffy, or Bobby and Pam, Duffy stated to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in 2017, &quot;We had great chemistry on the show and that just fell into place. It was the luckiest bit of casting, I think, that has occurred in a long time on television. Everybody was absolutely perfect for the parts they played. For a &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; basically subject matter for Bobby and Pam, we were absolutely the most comfortable two actors when we were working together. Victoria had a wonderful sense of humor. We could just go crazy between takes and then get right back into the moment.

Over the course of her nine-year run on &quot;Dallas&quot;, Principal found worldwide fame. Principal left &quot;Dallas&quot; in 1987, after a two-year decision to prepare with the series&#x27; producers for the final season of her character&#x27;s arc. However, as an actress, she intentionally worked on separating her own persona from that of her on-screen character, as she explained in 1987 to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in an interview during her final week of shooting on the &quot;Dallas&quot; set, &quot;A lot of work has gone into keeping Victoria Principal separate from Pam Ewing. To stay on the show any longer would really seal my fate in the industry.&quot;

Reflecting on her time at &quot;Dallas&quot;, Principal stated to &quot;People&quot; in 2018, &quot;At year seven, it was time for me to renegotiate my contract and I was very candid about my concern and my disappointment, that we had had such good writing and so many wonderful plots, and that when the time came to renegotiate the writers&#x27; contracts, I felt that a number of writers had left because they had not gotten the right deal.&quot; As she further explained to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2018, &quot;The first five years on &quot;Dallas&quot; were so unbelievably wonderful — then some key writers departed, and by year seven there was a decline in the writing, which was an enormous part of my decision to leave. I informed the producers during renegotiations in the seventh year that I would only stay for two more. They wanted a longer contract, and I said no. I was completely transparent. I learned a lot from playing Pam. She was someone with such innate goodness and who was courageous in fighting for what she believed in. It was really a privilege to play her.&quot;

===1987–present===
Principal went on to star in various television films, some of which she produced through her production company Victoria Principal Productions, before stepping away to focus on her health and wellness projects. She has produced and starred in a half dozen major television productions, including &quot;Naked Lie&quot; (1989), &quot;Blind Witness&quot; (1989), and &quot;Sparks: The Price of Passion&quot; (1990).

In 1994, Principal appeared in an episode of the hit TV sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. Through the late 1990s and in 2000, she continued to appear as a guest star on several TV sitcoms and primetime drama series, including &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot;, and &quot;The Practice&quot;, as well as appearing as herself on the comedy skit show &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot;.

In 1998, Principal co-starred in the French comedy feature film, &quot;Michael Kael vs. the World News Company&quot;, written by and starring Benoît Delépine. The cast included Marine Delterme, Mickey Rooney, Elliott Gould, William Atherton, and Féodor Atkine. The plot centers on a journalist who disrupts the cynical collusion between a CNN-type entity and covert operators in Washington in 1999, at Miami-based international news giant corporation WNC, where star co-anchors Leila Parker (Principal) and James Denit (Atherton) hate each other&#x27;s guts. Their boss, Coogan (Gould), reminds them they pull in top ratings as a pair.

Principal returned to primetime soap-opera television in 2000, when she appeared in another Aaron Spelling production, the short-lived NBC television series &quot;Titans&quot;, with co-stars John Barrowman, Perry King, and Yasmine Bleeth. Thirteen episodes were filmed, of which 11 were actually aired. Produced by Spelling, the series was initially marketed as a &quot;&quot;Dynasty&quot; for the new millennium,&quot; attempting to emulate the style of Spelling&#x27;s earlier hit series. However, low ratings led NBC to cancel the series before its first season was completed.

After appearing in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Titans&quot;, Principal dedicated her time fully to her skincare company and to philanthropic activities, as she confirmed to &quot;People&quot; in 2018, &quot;By the time I turned 50, I felt that I wanted to make a change in my life&quot; — she says, of ultimately leaving Hollywood after 2001 — &#x27;My interest had shifted in such a way that would totally pursue my passion, which more and more really was my skincare company and creating products that could help many people.&quot;

In 2004, Principal featured along with other original &quot;Dallas&quot; cast members in &quot;Dallas Reunion: The Return to Southfork&quot;, a television special celebrating the 1978–1991 primetime series that aired on CBS.

===Music===
Principal recorded a pop single duet with Andy Gibb, titled &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot; (1981). The recording is a cover version of the original song by the Everly Brothers, written by husband-and-wife songwriting team Felice and Boudleaux Bryant (credited solely to Boudleaux), The Gibb/Principal 1981 duet song was released on RSO Records in August 1981. The single peaked at number 51 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on September 12, 1981. The song was Gibb&#x27;s last charting single, and the only single recorded by Principal.

==Entrepreneur==
When asked about the benefits of her entrepreneurial success — her skincare empire, best-selling author, television and film producer — Principal stated to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in 2012, that it is &quot;Working for myself and being willing to take all of the blame when things go wrong and happy to take the credit when I get it right.&quot;
===Victoria Principal Productions===
After Principal left the &quot;Dallas&quot; TV series in 1987, she began her own production company, Victoria Principal Productions, producing mostly television films. Principal went on to star in various television films, some of which she produced through her production company, before stepping away to focus on her health and wellness projects. She has produced and starred in a half dozen major television productions, including &quot;Naked Lie&quot; (1989), &quot;Blind Witness&quot; (1989), and &quot;Sparks: The Price of Passion&quot; (1990).

===Principal Secret Skincare===
In the mid-1980s, Principal became interested in natural-beauty therapies, and in 1989, she created a self-named line of skincare products, Principal Secret. Over the past 25 years, Principal has built her skincare empire. In 2000, Principal became a member of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists (SCC). The SCC is dedicated to the advancement of cosmetic science, and strives to increase and disseminate scientific information through meetings and publications. In January 2011, she launched a line of jewelry called Keys &amp; Hearts available on the same site as her skincare line.

In August 2013, the CEO of Guthy Renker revealed to &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; that Principal&#x27;s business, Principal Secret Skincare, had revenue of more than $1.5 billion to date, an increase of more than a half-billion dollars over the revenue up to 2007.
As Principal told &quot;TV Insider&quot; in 2018, &quot;I continue to be passionately dedicated to running my skincare company, Principal Secret. We are about to celebrate 27 years in business. And I have never forgotten that &quot;Dallas&quot; gave me the springboard to achieve so many of my dreams.&quot;.

In April 2019, Principal announced that she was stepping away from Principal Secret with Guthy Renker acquiring the business. Principal announced that she would be focusing on her foundation The Victoria Principal Foundation for Thoughtful Existence.

==Books==
In the 1980s, Principal became a best-selling author, writing three books about beauty, skincare, fitness, well-being and, health: &quot;The Body Principal&quot; (1983); &quot;The Beauty Principal&quot; (1984); and &quot;The Diet Principal&quot; (1987). In the 2000s, she wrote a fourth book &quot;Living Principal&quot; (2001). After 12 weeks on &quot;The New York Times Best Seller list&quot; in the general non-fiction category, &quot;The Body Principal&quot; was the first &quot;Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous&quot; No. 1 bestseller when that List debuted January 1, 1984.

==Awards==
Principal is a two-time Golden Globe Award nominee: 1973, nominee for Most Promising Newcomer — Female: &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot;; and 1983, nominee for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series — Drama: &quot;Dallas&quot;.

In 1981 and 1982, Principal was the recipient of the &quot;Bravo Otto&quot; Award, a German accolade honoring excellence of performers in film, television, and music. She was also a nominee for the award in 1983.

On October 2, 2010, Principal was honored at the opening of Legacy Park in Malibu near the Pacific Coast Highway as a founding member of the park back in 2004. Over a 12-year period, she served the Arthritis Foundation as honorary chairman and ambassador to government.

==Personal life==
Principal has been married and divorced twice, and has no children. During the filming of &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; (1972), she dated actor Anthony Perkins, who lost his virginity to her.

Her first marriage was to writer-producer Christopher Skinner, whom she met in 1978 when he played a bit acting part on &quot;Dallas&quot;. The couple wed soon after beginning their relationship. They filed for divorce two years later in 1980, it was finalized in 1981.

Principal had a high-profile relationship with English-Australian singer-songwriter Andy Gibb. The pair met on &quot;The John Davidson Show&quot; in January 1981 and had immediate chemistry. They celebrated their love in a duet song, &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot; (1981), a modest pop-chart hit that peaked at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on September 12, 1981. The recording was the last single by Gibb, and is the only single recorded by Principal. The relationship ended in March 1982, due to Gibb&#x27;s escalating drug addiction problems. After Gibb&#x27;s death in 1988, Principal explained to &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Our breakup was preceded and precipitated by Andy&#x27;s use of drugs.&quot; She clarified, &quot;I did everything I could to help him, but then I told him he would have to choose between me and his problem.&quot;

Principal met prominent Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Harry Glassman in 1983. They married on June 22, 1985, in Dallas, Texas, when Principal was seven years into her role on &quot;Dallas&quot;. The couple lived in Beverly Hills. In May 2006, Principal filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple divorced in December 2006, with Principal stating, &quot;We have had a loving relationship for over 20 years.&quot;

Principal later moved to Malibu, California. She owns properties in Big Sur, California, and Switzerland.
In 2007, Principal showed interest in training for her booked flight on the Richard Branson&#x27;s commercial space flight venture, the galactic passage ticket which she purchased in 2009. Principal stated, &quot;Going into space fulfills many desires I have of seeing the planet, going fast, going someplace very few people have been—and hopefully coming back down!&quot; In 2012, Principal withdrew from the Branson-led program.

Since 2012, Principal has developed a ranch property outside of Los Angeles, where she rescues and rehabilitates animals.

==Philanthropy==

Principal told &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in 2012, &quot;My deepest concern is for the planet and every living thing on it. Without a healthy planet, education won&#x27;t matter, hunger won&#x27;t matter, and science won&#x27;t matter because we will not survive. Unless we rectify the damage we have done to our land and our oceans, then I truly believe, the planet will reclaim itself.

In 2006, Principal formed a charitable organization, the Victoria Principal Foundation For Thoughtful Existence, to help subsidize the environmental movement, of which she had been an active participant since 1978. The impetus of the foundation is to help financially support the planet and life upon it. Principal is particularly involved with ecology, oceans, banning toxic substances, helping children, and rescuing and rehabilitating animals. She provided aid those in need after the 2008 California wildfires. On June 2, 2010, she donated $200,000 to the cleanup effort in the Gulf Coast region. Her donations brought together two huge environmental nonprofits, Oceana and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), to work together on the cleanup.

Principal appeared with other celebrities on June 21, 2010, in a CNN Larry King–sponsored telethon to support the Gulf Coast region following the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Principal was on a panel with King, answered phones, and spoke to donors for the entire two hours. The telethon raised over $1.8 million.

Principal is a former co-chairman of Victory Over Violence, the LA County Domestic Violence Council Community Advisory Board. The board is a coalition of representatives from the entertainment industry, business, government, and community who have come together with the dual purposes of increasing public awareness of issues surrounding domestic violence and increasing shelter and victim resources.

On December 13, 2011, Principal donated a substantial sum to the nonprofit marine conservation organization Oceana, and to NRDC to stop the expansion of offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic Ocean, fearing such activity could lead to another disastrous oil spill. On December 20, 2011, the Giving Back Fund named Principal as one of the Top 30 Celebrity Charity Donors for 2011.

In 2012, Principal funded and participated in an online campaign with the NRDC in an effort to stop sonic blasting along the California coastline and prevent the deaths of hundreds of marine mammals and marine life. In 2012, she funded, through Tree People, the creation of a mobile emergency fire warning system for the Los Angeles area. In 2013, this system was completed and implemented, the first of its kind in California.

In 2013, Principal funded an ad bringing awareness to the plight of sea lion pups washing up along the California coastline and provided funds to Wildlife Org. for their rescue and rehabilitation.

In 2013, after the deadly Moore, Oklahoma, EF5 tornado, Principal funded the American Humane Association&#x27;s famous Red Star Rescue Team to help search, rescue, and shelter injured and missing animals with the ultimate goal of reuniting them with their families. In August 2013, she funded in collaboration with Tree People a new mobile system that allows citizens to participate in critical wildfire prevention by texting.

In July 2014, Principal made a substantial contribution to NRDC&#x27;s campaign for Save the Bees. She stated, &quot;As of yesterday, I&#x27;ve now made a substantial donation and joined in support of the NRDC&#x27;s campaign for Save the Bees. Without bees, our fruit- and vegetable-bearing plants and trees will cease to be productive.&quot; In August 2014, she fully funded, with the help of Mission K9 rescue, the return of military working dog Maxi from Japan to the United States to be reunited with her former Marine handler. Two months later, she donated $100,000 to support Malibu ballot initiative Measure R, which sought to limit the environmental impact of development in Malibu by requiring a vote on any new developments over 20,000 square feet. In November, the initiative was passed by voters.

In May 2015, Principal fully funded the Red Star Rescue Team of the American Humane Association for the rescue and rehabilitation of 150 dogs that had been injured and displaced by tornadoes and floods in Oklahoma and Texas. The following year, she created the Moki fund to help rescue animals and provide medical care so that they can be adopted into permanent homes. In August 2016, Principal worked with the American Red Cross to provide shelter and food for the victims of the 2016 Louisiana floods, as well as the American Humane Association to help rescue and shelter animals that were displaced in Louisiana and attempt to reunite them with their owners.

In April 2018, Principal announced that she will double the impact of individual gifts by matching donations to Oceana, up to $50,000 to help protect U.S. coasts from the dangers of offshore oil and gas. Explaining her commitment, Principal has stated, &quot;Oceana successfully protected much of the Atlantic and Arctic from new drilling in the past, but now those protections are at risk. Oceana knows how to win victories for our oceans, and I am making this commitment to encourage people across the country to join me in the fight to protect our coasts.&quot;

In September 2018, Principal donated a fleet of rescue boats to help American Humane with animal disaster relief efforts in the Carolinas after Hurricane Florence.

<text>White Bluffs was an agricultural town in Benton County, Washington, United States. It was depopulated in 1943 along with the town of Hanford to make room for the nuclear production facility known as the Hanford Site.

==History==

Prior to the arrival of white settlers, the land was inhabited by the Wanapum Indians, a tribe closely related to the Palouse, Yakama, and Nez Perce tribes.

The first white settlement at White Bluffs was in 1861. The original townsite was located on the east bank of the Columbia River in Franklin County, near present-day Area 100H of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. A ferry was built to accommodate traffic across the Columbia headed for the gold rush in British Columbia. By the early 1890s the population had grown and the town expanded to the west bank of the Columbia in Benton County.

The state government authorized a &quot;colonization&quot; project in 1921 to build 99 homes for returning World War I veterans, but abandoned it in 1925.

===Hanford Site===
When U.S. government seizures of homes of White Bluffs residents occurred beginning in March 1943, some homes were seized immediately for government office buildings. Residents were given from three days to two months to abandon their homes. Homes and orchards were burned by the government to clear the site. The remains of some 177 persons buried at the White Bluffs Cemetery were moved on May 6, 1943, to the East Prosser Cemetery, some 30 miles (50 km) away.

At the time of the government destruction of the town of White Bluffs, production of pears, apples, vegetables, and grapes for wine production were primary sources of livelihood.

Almost nothing remains of the town. A U.S. Department of Energy photo gallery containing various White Bluffs pictures was released on June 15, 2008.

<doc id="654805" wikidata="Q1514522" url="?curid=654805" title="Santa Clarita Valley">
<text>The Santa Clarita Valley (SCV) is part of the upper watershed of the Santa Clara River in Southern California. The western portion of the valley was part of the Rancho San Francisco Mexican land grant. Located in Los Angeles County. The valley&#x27;s main population center is the city of Santa Clarita which includes the neighborhoods of Canyon Country, Newhall, Saugus, and Valencia. Adjacent unincorporated communities include Castaic, Stevenson Ranch, Val Verde, and Valencia.

==Etymology==
The Santa Clara River was named by Spanish explorers for Clare of Assisi. The valley later became known as &quot;little Santa Clara&quot; in deference to the Northern California mission and city of Santa Clara, California. In time, &quot;little Santa Clara&quot; became &quot;Santa Clarita&quot;.

==Geography==
The Santa Clarita Valley is bordered by the Lake Piru area, including the community of Val Verde, Los Padres National Forest, and Castaic Lake to the northwest, Sierra Pelona Mountains and Angeles National Forest to the north and northeast, San Gabriel Mountains to the east and southeast, and Santa Susana Mountains to the south and southwest, and Ventura County and the Santa Clara River Valley to the west. To the west-northwest lies the Topatopa Mountains.

Santa Clarita Valley is connected to a wide array of other nearby valleys: the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles Basin via Newhall Pass to the south; Antelope Valley via CA 14 through Soledad Pass to the northeast; the San Joaquin Valley via I-5 through Tejon Pass to the northwest, and Leona Valley via San Francisquito and Bouquet canyons.

Downstream lies the Santa Clara River Valley, which was given the moniker Heritage Valley by the tourism bureau representing Piru, Fillmore, and Santa Paula. Upstream is Soledad Canyon which contains the communities of Vincent, Acton, Ravenna, and Agua Dulce.

==Geology==
The Santa Clarita Valley is underlain by Quaternary alluvial deposits and coarse-grained Pleistocene age conglomerates dominated by sandstone of marine and non-marine origin. The far eastern end of the valley features predominantly coarse-grained Tertiary age formations of sedimentary origin. The southern end of Bouquet Canyon features a large areas of artificial fill stretching from Newhall Ranch Road up to Copper Hill Drive.

The valley is bisected by the San Gabriel Fault, which runs through the center of the valley along a NW-SE axis. The much smaller Holser Fault runs east-to-west between the south-eastern Topatopa Mountains and the present day community of Valencia. Neither fault line has been active since the early Holocene era.

The valley is located in the northeastern extreme of the Ventura Basin Province, a petroleum-rich sedimentary basin with a long history of oil and gas production.

==Climate==
The valley features a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;), approaching a semi-arid climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, moderately rainy winters with rare snowfall. Temperatures often exceed , even , on hot summer afternoons but rarely dip below on cold winter nights. The valley lies within plant hardiness zones 9b and 10a.

Late spring and early summer mornings are often overcast due to the formation of a marine layer off the coast that moves inland overnight. These clouds typically retreat out of the valley by midday.

The valley is part of a &quot;wind-tunnel-like-corridor&quot; that connects the high desert with the Oxnard Plain on the coast. This funnels the Santa Ana winds which spreads wildfires and has been called one of the &quot;most dangerous wind and fire corridors in Southern California.&quot;

===Wildfires===

Characterized by dry hills covered in brush and chaparral, Santa Clarita is susceptible to wildfires. Although wildfires are most common in summer and fall, they can occur throughout the year during drought conditions, such as in December 2017. Wildfire risk is highest when Santa Ana winds blow through the area from the Mojave Desert.

Notable wildfires in the Santa Clarita Valley include the Buckweed Fire, Sand Fire, Rye Fire, Tick Fire, and Maria Fire.

==Ecology==

Santa Clarita lies on the boundary between the WWF-designated California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion to the southwest, and California montane chaparral and woodlands ecoregion to the northeast.

Resident species of note include bobcat, coyote, red-tailed hawk, and desert cottontail.

== Entertainment ==
The Santa Clarita Valley is about from the Burbank Bob Hope Airport, and about from Los Angeles International Airport. It is home to the theme park Six Flags Magic Mountain which includes the gated waterpark Six Flags Hurricane Harbor. It offers a variety of family-oriented activity centers such as the Santa Clarita Aquatics Center, Copper Horse Riding Ranch, and the Cube (formerly Ice Station Valencia), restaurants and shopping centers, golf courses, cinemas and theaters, luxurious day spas, outdoor recreation areas like Castaic Lake, Placerita Canyon, and Santa Clarita Woodlands Park, as well as acres of parkland, animal sanctuaries like the Gentle Barn and Gibbon Conservation Center, over 70 miles of paseos and trails for hiking and biking, and more. The valley is also home to a number of historical sites, such as the oil drilling town Mentryville, Walk of Western Stars, and William S. Hart Ranch and Museum. The Santa Clarita Valley has a rich Western heritage, and since 1994, it has hosted an annual Cowboy Festival, which attracts more than 10,000 visitors each year.

== Education ==

Elementary school students in Santa Clarita are served by the Castaic, Newhall, Saugus, and Sulphur Springs school districts. Junior high and high schools are part of the William S. Hart Union High School District, except for Castaic Middle School which is in the Castaic Union School District.

The unincorporated mountain communities of Acton and Agua Dulce are served by the Acton-Agua Dulce Unified School District, which serves students from kindergarten through 12th grade.

There are three institutions of higher education in the valley: College of the Canyons, California Institute of the Arts, and The Master&#x27;s University.

<doc id="654814" wikidata="Q7655446" url="?curid=654814" title="Sweet Polly Oliver">
<text>&quot;Sweet Polly Oliver&quot; is an English broadside ballad (Roud #367), traceable from 1840 or earlier. It is also known as &quot;Pretty Polly Oliver&quot; and has several variant sets of lyrics, set to a single anonymous melody.

It is one of the best known of a number of folk songs describing women disguising themselves as men to join the army to be with their lovers.

Thomas Root wrote a symphonic band arrangement and Benjamin Britten wrote an arrangement for voice and piano.

==Lyrics==
: As sweet Polly Oliver lay musing in bed,
: A sudden strange fancy came into her head.
: &quot;Nor father nor mother shall make me false prove,
: I&#x27;ll &#x27;list as a soldier, and follow my love.&quot;

: So early next morning she softly arose,
: And dressed herself up in her dead brother&#x27;s clothes.
: She cut her hair close, and she stained her face brown,
: And went for a soldier to fair London Town.

: Then up spoke the sergeant one day at his drill,
: &quot;Now who&#x27;s good for nursing? A captain, he&#x27;s ill.&quot;
: &quot;I&#x27;m ready,&quot; said Polly. To nurse him she&#x27;s gone,
: And finds it&#x27;s her true love all wasted and wan.

: The first week the doctor kept shaking his head,
: &quot;No nursing, young fellow, can save him,&quot; he said.
: But when Polly Oliver had nursed him back to life 
: He cried, &quot;You have cherished him as if you were his wife&quot;.

: O then Polly Oliver, she burst into tears 
: And told the good doctor her hopes and her fears,
: And very shortly after, for better or for worse, 
: The captain took joyfully his pretty soldier nurse.

==In popular culture==
The main theme of Terry Pratchett’s book, &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot;, in which a young woman named Polly, who has heard the song sung in her father&#x27;s inn, joins the army, as a man, to find her brother, taking the name Oliver.

<text>The Manding languages (sometimes spelt Manden) are a dialect continuum within the Niger-Congo family spoken in West Africa. Varieties of Manding are generally considered (among native speakers) to be mutually intelligible – dependent on exposure or familiarity with dialects between speakers – and spoken by 9.1 million people in the countries Burkina Faso, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali, Liberia, Ivory Coast and The Gambia. Their best-known members are Mandinka or Mandingo, the principal language of The Gambia; Bambara, the most widely spoken language in Mali; Maninka or Malinké, a major language of Guinea and Mali; and Jula, a trade language of Ivory Coast and western Burkina Faso. Manding is part of the larger Mandé family of languages.

==Subdivisions==
The Manding languages, the differences from one another and relationships among them are matters that continue to be researched. In addition, the nomenclature is a mixture of indigenous terms and words applied by English and French speakers since before the colonisation of Africa, which makes the picture complex and even confusing.

The Mandinka people speak varieties from the first two groups. The differences between the western and eastern branches manifest themselves primarily phonetically. While dialects of the western group usually have 10 vowels (5 oral and 5 long/nasal), the eastern group, typified by Bambara, has 14 vowels (7 oral and 7 nasal):
* Manding
** West
*** Kassonke – Western Maninka (Mali, Senegal)
*** Mandinka (Senegal, Gambia, Guinea Bissau)
*** Kita Maninka (Mali)
*** Jahanka (Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, Mali; one of several dialects under this name)
** East
*** Marka (Dafin) (Burkina Faso, Mali)
*** Bambara–Dyula (Northeastern Manding; Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast)
*** Eastern Maninka (Southeastern Manding; multiple varieties in Mali, Guinea, Ivory Coast)
*** Bolon (Burkina Faso)
In addition, Sininkere (Burkina Faso) is of an unclear placement within Manding.

==Writing==
The Manding languages have a strong oral tradition, but also have written forms: adaptations of the Arabic alphabet and the Latin alphabet and at least two indigenous scripts.
*The Arabic alphabet was introduced into the region with the arrival of Islam and was adapted to write in the Manding languages as the Ajami, which is still commonly used for Mandinka.
*The Latin alphabet was introduced into the region following European conquest and colonization. It is used fairly widely, with &quot;official&quot; versions in many countries, for teaching, literacy and publication.
*The NKo alphabet, developed in 1949 by Solomana Kante, is designed to write Manding using a common literary standard comprehensible to speakers of all these varieties. It is gaining popularity.
*A lesser-known alphabet for Bambara was developed in the early 20th century but is not used.

<text>Oswald José Peraza [pay-RAH-za] (born October 19, 1962) is a Venezuelan former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Baltimore Orioles (1988). He batted and threw right-handed. As of the 2014 season, he is the pitching coach for the Dominican Summer League Blue Jays.

Peraza was a hard thrower with a fastball in the 94–95 range. He also had a good slider and a fine change-up. He was traded from the Toronto Blue Jays to the Orioles for Mike Flanagan on August 31, 1987 in a transaction that was completed four days later on September 4 when José Mesa was sent to Baltimore. Peraza debuted with Baltimore in 1988, then missed the following season with arm problems, which were serious enough to affect the rest of his career. In his rookie season, Peraza posted a 10–14 record with 61 strikeouts and a 5.55 of ERA in 86 innings pitched.

Peraza, who was once one of the more highly touted prospects in the game, could not make it out of Triple-A ball after 1988 and he retired for good after three injury riddled years (1990–92).

<text>Erica Kane is a fictional character from the American ABC Daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. The character was portrayed by actress Susan Lucci from her debut on January 16, 1970, until the last broadcast television episode on September 23, 2011. Lucci was expected to guest star on Prospect Park&#x27;s continuation of &quot;All My Children&quot; in 2013, but the appearance never came to fruition due to the show&#x27;s second cancellation.

Erica is considered to be the most popular character in American soap opera history. &quot;TV Guide&quot; calls her &quot;unequivocally the most famous soap opera character in the history of daytime TV,&quot; and included her in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.

==Character creation==
===Background===
Agnes Nixon created Erica Kane in the 1960s as part of the story bible for &quot;All My Children&quot;, a light-hearted soap opera focusing on social issues and young love. Nixon unsuccessfully attempted to sell the series to NBC, then to CBS, and once again to NBC through Procter &amp; Gamble. With Procter &amp; Gamble unable to make room for the new series in its line up, she put &quot;All My Children&quot; on hold. Nixon became head writer of &quot;Another World&quot; where she used the model of the Erica character to create a brand new character: Rachel Davis. Nixon said Rachel was Erica&#x27;s &quot;precursor to the public.&quot; She detailed Rachel&#x27;s goals as less &quot;stratospheric&quot; in nature since her primary motivation involved marrying Dr. Russ Mathews or a man with money while Erica wanted love, independence, and fame. &quot;What Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream, they&#x27;d be satisfied,&quot; Nixon said. &quot;But that dream has been elusive.&quot;

After the success of &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, a series Nixon created in 1968, ABC asked her to create another soap opera for them. She used the story bible for &quot;All My Children&quot; to create the new program. The Erica character officially debuted in 1970 once &quot;All My Children&quot; made it onto the air.

===Casting===
At the time, soap operas featured mostly older casts. To add a contemporary feel to the show, Nixon focused on younger characters, while also mixing in older ones so as not to lose traditional viewers. The youths on &quot;All My Children&quot; were Tara Martin (Karen Lynn Gorney), Phillip Brent (Richard Hatch), Chuck Tyler (Jack Stauffer), and Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). For those parts, the show wanted to cast unknown actors.

In 1969, Susan Lucci responded to a casting call for &quot;All My Children&quot;. She initially auditioned for the role of Tara Martin. The &quot;character that we were all interested in was not Erica, but Tara,&quot; said Doris Quinlan, the show&#x27;s former executive producer. &quot;She was the sweet young ingenue — the one with all the problems that everyone was supposed to care about... I certainly couldn&#x27;t cast [Lucci] as a young, innocent, sweet little Irish girl. That&#x27;s not what comes out. She&#x27;s much more sophisticated – at least she gives that appearance. She was perfect to play Erica.&quot; After a meeting with a casting director, they promised to call her back in six months. One of hundreds of people they called back in, Lucci progressed on from each reading of the part until she received the role. &quot;I saw the audition tapes, and she just stood out,&quot; said Agnes Nixon. &quot;There was never a question, ever.&quot;

Before being cast as Erica Kane, Lucci did not have much success in her acting career. A casting director discouraged her from pursuing roles on television because her hair, skin, and eyes were too dark. Though Lucci&#x27;s olive complexion held her back from other acting opportunities, it worked in her favor while up for the role of Erica. &quot;Agnes Nixon, the show&#x27;s creator, really wanted somebody dark to play this part. She has always been ahead of her time,&quot; Lucci said. Lucci debuted in episode 10 of the series. In portraying Erica, the actress drew on the &quot;self-centered&quot; and &quot;haughty&quot; traits she recognized in herself while in college. Lucci said, &quot;I love playing her. I enjoyed playing her when she was a 15-year-old high school girl, the naughty girl in town, and I enjoy playing her now, when she&#x27;s still the naughty girl, but she&#x27;s broadened her area of operation to include the entire world.&quot;

===Archetypes===
Over the years, Erica developed into different character archetypes. Soap operas once featured only one-dimensional characters who were either good or bad. By the 1970s, characters were written with more depth, fitting into archetypes consisting of the young-and-vulnerable romantic heroine, the old-fashioned villain, the rival, the suffering antagonist, Mr. Right, the former playboy, the meddlesome and villainous mother/grandmother, the benevolent mother/grandmother, and the career woman. Erica was established as the rival to Tara Martin&#x27;s young-and-vulnerable romantic heroine. As the rival, Erica was written as money and status-conscious as well as sexually aggressive. Erica was generally positioned as the antagonist keeping true love pairings, such as Tara and Phillip Brent, apart.

By the late 1970s, a different set of character types were established, including the chic suburbanite, the subtle single, the traditional family person, the successful professional, and the elegant socialite. Erica was in the chic suburbanite category which comprised &quot;flashy,&quot; achievement-oriented characters with little interest in family and friends. Like others in this category, Erica was written as &quot;flamboyant, frivolous and carefree, with little commitment other than [her] own selfish enjoyment of life.&quot;

Overall, Erica is the embodiment of &quot;the bitch goddess,&quot; a soap opera archetype that &quot;transformed and defined&quot; the soap opera genre. Irna Phillips, Nixon, and William J. Bell created the archetype in the 1960s and it became one of their defining legacies. The archetype is an assertive Cinderella who goes after material things. This was a change from the heroines of the radio soap operas who waited to be rescued by men. Erica started out as &quot;a conniving teenage vixen&quot; and transformed into &quot;the femme fatale incarnate.&quot; The characters in this category are outrageous, exaggerated, financially disadvantaged and determined to change that. Other characters in this archetype are Lisa Grimaldi (&quot;As the World Turns&quot;), Rachel Davis (&quot;Another World&quot;) and Belle Clemons (&quot;The Secret Storm&quot;).

==Character development==
===Characteristics===

Erica is a headstrong and selfish 15-year-old when &quot;All My Children&quot; begun in 1970. Although Nixon designed her as one of the bad characters, she was not intended to come off as evil or menacing. Since Nixon created &quot;All My Children&quot; as a &quot;light hearted&quot; soap opera, the series&#x27; villains, Erica included, came across as more fun and funny, than wicked. Over time, Erica evolved into a &quot;heroine-vixen&quot; who still did bad things, but was also a character the audience rooted for. Former associate producer Felicia Minei Behr said, &quot;The Erica that [Lucci] started with, was a kid who was one-dimensional, who was the rotten seed, and she turned her into a very fascinating character- the character that everybody loves to hate.&quot; Characterized as the &quot;naughty girl in town&quot; from the start, her motivations stem from her relationship with her father. Her abandonment by him led her to be written as sexually aggressive with men. She needs to receive love from men to prove she is not unlovable.

One of Erica&#x27;s defining features is her extreme self-centered point of view. Erica is described as &quot;imaginative, adventurous, and brilliant&quot;, yet writers detailed her as appearing &quot;scarcely rational enough to cope with adulthood.&quot; Despite this, the character represents independence and power. &quot;I think of Erica as a go-getter,&quot; Lucci said, &quot;someone who&#x27;s impatient to have a terrific life and have it yesterday. I think a lot of people can identify with that.&quot; She always controls her business whether involved with a man or not. Some of the jobs she has been given during her storylines include a high fashion model, a cosmetics tycoon, and a magazine publisher.

When Charles Pratt, Jr. took over as head writer of &quot;All My Children&quot; in 2008, one of his goals for improving the series involved making Erica the focus of the show again. &quot;[A]bove all, the show is, and should always revolve around, Erica,&quot; he said in an interview with &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;. &quot;I can see the temptation to split her off and put her in jail and put her on the run. We did it on &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;! But to me, she is the Scarlett O&#x27;Hara of this show and she must always be that, be the center and the heart of the show. Challenging that character that way, making her the powerful woman she should be, is important.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD 07/29/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
When &quot;All My Children&quot; debuts, the Kane family consists of Erica, her mother, Mona (Frances Heflin), and her absent father, film director Eric Kane (Albert Stratton). Mona spoils Erica to fill the void Eric left behind. Despite this, the writers scripted the relationship between Mona and Erica as tumultuous, with Mona disapproving of Erica&#x27;s behavior and Erica blaming Mona for her father&#x27;s desertion. The relationship is later developed into a strong bond. The writers layered their interactions with &quot;raw edges&quot; and humor. &quot;Erica idealized her father. Heflin said. Whenever Eric disappoints Erica, she blames her mother. &quot;Then, of course, would come the moment of breakdown when she would cry on [Mona&#x27;s] shoulder,&quot; Helfin said. &quot;So it&#x27;s more or less human. Really, more human and less saccharine than most of the mother/children relationships on soaps. It has an awful lot of bit in it.&quot; After Mona&#x27;s death in 1994, Erica continues to put Eric on a pedestal, refusing to acknowledge his flaws.

From the start of the series, the lack of a relationship with her father serves as motivation for Erica&#x27;s actions. She is an example of the Nixon staple of the &quot;lost daddy&#x27;s girl.&quot; Eric abandons her and her mother before the start of the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. &quot;Susan added a lot of Erica&#x27;s background,&quot; Behr said. &quot;Rather than playing it as if Erica&#x27;s just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how &#x27;My father loves me. I know that he loves me and nobody is going to tell me differently,&#x27; she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said we have to play this out.&quot; In 1989, Eric makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.

The 1993 arrival of Kendall Hart (Sarah Michelle Gellar) prompted the reveal that, prior to the series&#x27; debut, Erica had been raped at age 14 by Eric&#x27;s friend, film star Richard Fields. Eric had allowed Richard, who had a &quot;crush&quot; on Erica, to be alone with her and had done nothing to prevent the rape from occurring. A revisitation of the event during Erica&#x27;s 2004 alcohol intervention storyline introduced the fact Eric had actually offered up Erica for sex with Richard to convince the actor to star in one of Eric&#x27;s films. Erica represses all memory of the rape until 16-year-old Kendall, a child conceived by it and revealed to be Erica&#x27;s first born daughter she gave up for adoption to the Harts, appears in 1993. Viewer reaction to the discrepancy created by Erica&#x27;s having a 16-year-old daughter conceived in a 24-year-old rape prompted the series to immediately adjust Kendall&#x27;s age to 23. The mother-daughter relationship between Erica and Kendall was designed as antagonistic and complex, with Kendall, unaware of the rape, seeking revenge against Erica in feeling she &quot;abandoned&quot; her as an infant, while wanting her mother&#x27;s approval. Kendall&#x27;s attempted seduction of Erica&#x27;s love interest, Dimitri Marick, creates conflict between him and Erica, and Kendall also brings Richard Fields to town to torment her mother. Kendall later makes peace with her mother and leaves town in 1995. She returns in 2002, portrayed by a new actress, Alicia Minshew, as Kendall&#x27;s birth year was revised to 1976. The later story between Erica and Kendall displayed each character&#x27;s point of view as they both deal with the ramifications of how Kendall&#x27;s conception traumatized them, which Lucci praised. A reconciliation later occurs for the characters wherein they bond as mother and daughter.

In a topical 1971 storyline, Erica aborts the baby she conceives with her first husband, Jeff Martin (Charles Frank). This is the first legal abortion aired on American television prior to the landmark Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling as Erica sought an abortion in the state of New York which had legalized the procedure in July 1970. Erica was chosen for this storyline as a way to prevent controversy. Since she was a bad girl and not one of the heroines, her choice would not be viewed as something the show supported. The show also protected themselves from controversy by writing Erica as mentally blocking out the abortion and, for a time, believing she miscarried. Viewers loved the story and Erica became a symbol of free choice. Erica develops a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion. &quot;Erica&#x27;s abortion was simply because she didn&#x27;t want to have a child, and I think if you do that now, you would perhaps hurt your character,&quot; said former &quot;All My Children&quot; head writer Megan McTavish. McTavish later rewrote the story so the doctor, Greg Madden (Ian Buchanan), transplants the aborted fetus into his infertile wife. They raise the child, Josh Madden (Colin Egglesfield), as their son without Erica&#x27;s knowledge. &quot;Inkling Magazine&quot; pointed out how unrealistic this storyline was because &quot;the techniques by which abortion is performed don&#x27;t exactly lend themselves to excising an embryo viable enough to survive in another woman&#x27;s womb.&quot; The magazine said more likelihood existed in the possibility that Madden harvested Erica&#x27;s eggs during the procedure, though an invasive surgery like that going unnoticed appeared unlikely as well. Egglesfield gained different information on the probability of the story. In an interview with &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;, he said, &quot;Actually, my father is an obstetrician/gynecologist and my brother is a doctor, as is one of my best friends, and their collective opinion is that this is possible; it is possible to take a fetus out of one woman and place it into the womb of another woman, but it&#x27;s only possible within the first week of pregnancy, before the fetus actually starts attaching itself to the uterine lining.&quot; In the storyline, Greg harbors an obsession with Erica, which motivates him to choose her for the transplant in the first place. Greg and Josh make their first appearances in 2005. Greg&#x27;s wife recently died and he moves to Pine Valley for closer proximity to Erica under the guise of opening a clinic. Josh follows him soon afterward and, not knowing Erica is his mother, attempts to destroy Erica in order to steal her fame for himself. Erica discovers the truth and is eventually able to form a relationship with him. In 2009, &quot;All My Children&quot; let Egglesfield go and killed off Josh. Zach Slater (Thorsten Kaye) shoots him and Erica is then forced to decide whether or not to donate Josh&#x27;s heart to a seriously ill Kendall. &quot;The first thought that came to my mind when I was told the storyline and read the script was &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;,&quot; said Lucci. Erica reluctantly agrees to the transplant. Lucci said she believed this decision would &quot;haunt&quot; Erica because, if Kendall&#x27;s life was not in the balance, she would have put more effort into saving Josh.

Erica&#x27;s youngest child, Bianca Montgomery, enters the series in 1988. At that time, Bianca is Erica&#x27;s first and only child since the Kendall and Josh characters were not created yet. In the storyline, Erica becomes pregnant with Travis Montgomery&#x27;s child and develops toxemia. The story was written to inform and educate the audience on the details of the condition. &quot;Inkling Magazine&quot; looked into the plausibility of her developing toxemia and found it believable. The magazine said, &quot;[W]omen who were born small for their gestational age have a higher risk of developing pre-eclampsia during their own pregnancies. The petite form of [Susan Lucci as Erica] seems to fit that description well. Also, given the character&#x27;s storyline, which included shooting her sister&#x27;s mother, Goldie, and the attraction she feels for Jack, her husband&#x27;s brother, she could have had high blood pressure from stress. That hypertension increases the risk of toxemia.&quot; Erica overcomes the medical difficulties and gives birth to Bianca. As she grows up, Erica sees her through Reye syndrome and anorexia nervosa. In 2000, &quot;All My Children&quot; cast Eden Riegel in the role of a teenage Bianca. The character comes out as a lesbian to her mother. Erica has trouble accepting the revelation, but eventually does. This storyline was inspired by the real life coming out story of Chaz Bono, and the initial reaction by his famous mother Cher.

Erica&#x27;s other relatives include half-siblings Mark Dalton (Mark LaMura) and Silver Kane (Mary LeSeene). In 1977, Mark and Erica begin a romance, which leads Mona to reveal Mark had also been fathered by Eric Kane, who had engaged in an affair with Mark&#x27;s mother, Maureen Dalton Tiller, Eric&#x27;s secretary. In 1982, while working in New York City as a model, Erica discovers a half-sister named Silver. Unlike Mark, Silver is the product of a secret marriage between Eric and a woman named Goldie. Silver secretly plots against Erica while pretending to form a bond with her. Silver is later exposed as an impostor named Connie, but the real Silver shows up soon after, only to be killed.

===Marriages and relationships===

The character has been married to multiple men, some more than once. Seven of her marriages to six different men have been valid, while four of her other marriages are invalid. Generally, the number of times Erica has been married is named as ten, though the total of her valid and invalid marriages, plus her 1991 vow renewal with Adam Chandler, would come up to eleven. Along with the marriages, the character is also given a number of other love interests. The motivation behind the multiple romances stems from the character&#x27;s need to fill the void her father left when he abandoned her.

As the series begins, Erica&#x27;s romantic role is as the rival keeping the &quot;true love&quot; pairings apart. The first story she is used this way in is the teenage love quadrangle between Erica, Phillip Brent, Tara Martin, and Chuck Tyler. In that story, Erica is used as one of the devices separating Tara and Phil. She breaks them up in 1970, but does not get him for herself until years later. Other couples she is used as a roadblock for are Jeff Martin and Mary Kennicott, Linc Tyler and Kitty Shae, and Chuck Tyler and Donna Beck.

Erica&#x27;s first two marriages, first to Dr. Jeff Martin in 1971 and then to Phil Brent in 1975, end because both men want her as a housewife instead of a career woman. Also, Erica is more interested in marrying them to spite Tara. Lucci described Jeff as a &quot;trophy&quot; and gaining Phil as &quot;a matter of pride for Erica.&quot; The marriage to Jeff ends when she leaves him for her modeling manager, Jason Maxwell, who Mona later kills in self-defense. Erica and Phil marry to give the baby they conceive a name. In the 1970s, pregnancy on a soap opera was romanticized so it was more influenced by the emotions and actions of the characters than by modern medicine. Since Phil and Erica do not conceive their baby for love, they are &quot;rewarded&quot; with a miscarriage, which was typical of loveless unions in that time. Phil wants a divorce after their baby&#x27;s stillbirth. Though her interest turns to pursuing richer men like Linc Tyler, she refuses to let him go because she does not want Tara to have him. Erica agrees to divorce Phil after his father, Nick Davis, offers her a job as a hostess at his restaurant, the Chateau, in exchange for letting his son go. Erica and Nick develop a romance. The relationship displays antagonistic yet loving qualities. It is the first time Erica meets her match in a man. Erica sees Nick as both a father figure and a lover. Though he loves her, he refuses to marry her, which infuriates Erica. She begins a romance with Tom Cudahay (Richard Shoberg) in the hopes of making Nick jealous. Even though it works, Nick fails to act on his jealousy and instead moves to Chicago. On Erica and Tom&#x27;s wedding day she hopes he will come back to interrupt the ceremony, but he does not.

&quot;All My Children&quot; shot Tom and Erica&#x27;s honeymoon on location in St. Croix, the location where Nixon wrote the bible for the series. This was the first daytime location shoot filmed outside of the United States. The location shoot involved activities never seen in daytime soap operas up to that point, such as snorkeling and horseback riding. They used the steady-cam technique, which was new at the time. The cameraman Nick Udack &quot;could walk or jog along side us on the beach,&quot; Shoberg said. &quot;The steady-cam had a gyroscope that would keep it from bouncing when you took steps&quot;. The stumbling blocks designed for Erica and Tom&#x27;s marriage involve the same as her last two since Erica puts her modeling career ahead of starting a family with Tom. They divorce after he discovers that she uses birth control pills.

Erica becomes involved with Mike Roy (Nicholas Surovy and then Hugo Napier), the man writing her biography, Raising Kane. &quot;He was Erica&#x27;s first great love,&quot; Lucci said. &quot;They were very different. He was very intellectual and she was not, and still he loved her for who she was.&quot; Mike and Erica fall in love and are kept apart by Adam Chandler (David Canary), the man producing a film adaptation of Raising Kane. Adam sends Mike away to Tibet to separate him and Erica. While Mike is away, Adam offers Erica the lead role in the movie if she marries him. She agrees and they marry in 1984, but Adam casts another actress in the role. After Mike returns, Adam tests Erica&#x27;s feelings for him by faking his death. She responds to his supposed demise by marrying Mike. Adam reveals he is alive, making their marriage invalid, and forces Erica to choose between him and Mike. She chooses Mike. They plan to marry but before they can he is shot. On his deathbed, he and Erica exchange vows.

Erica&#x27;s next love interest is the Tibetan monk Jeremy Hunter (Jean Leclerc). The Jeremy Hunter character was created as a polar opposite of Erica, in part, because he swore a vow of celibacy which contrasted with her sexuality. He is described as &quot;caring, creative, vulnerable, nurturing, patient, and tender.&quot; The maternal nature of the character was balanced by his physical and public power. Their relationship was written to reflect a form of protective dominance. Within the storyline, from the summer of 1985 to the summer of 1986 Jeremy rescues her from Adam, his father and Latin American terrorists, all of whom kidnap and attempt to sexually assault Erica. He also saves her from Natalie Marlow, who holds her at gun point. The relationship does not go both ways as they break up when Erica attempts to rescue him. In the story, Jeremy is convicted for a crime he did not commit, so Erica stages a wedding ceremony in prison as a way to break him out by escaping on a helicopter from the roof. Jeremy refuses to let her help him escape, ending their relationship. During the story where Jeremy rescued Erica from Adam, &quot;All My Children&quot; went on location to Canada to film the scenes. Later, the show again went on location, this time to New York&#x27;s West Chester County&#x27;s Wingdale hospital, which provided the setting for Erica&#x27;s attempt to break Jeremy out of prison.

In 1987, Erica becomes involved with the politician Travis Montgomery (Larkin Malloy). Erica and Travis are portrayed as sexually equal and infused with elements of romance and fantasy. Erica becomes pregnant with his child, but does not tell him for fear that it will disrupt his political career. In 1988, when Travis finds out about the baby, they get married. She becomes attracted to his brother, Jackson Montgomery (Walt Willey), but does not act on the feeling until after she and Travis divorce. They have &quot;a very hot romance&quot; and fall in love, but Erica remarries Travis in 1990 at their daughter Bianca&#x27;s insistence. Travis and Erica&#x27;s second marriage is not a happy one. &quot;I think after they got back together,&quot; said Lucci, &quot;it was never the same again. There was always this rift. He became bitter and sort of cruel to Erica.&quot; Their second marriage ends after Travis catches her cheating on him with Jack. During the custody hearing over Bianca, Jack refuses to lie about their affair, resulting in Erica losing custody of her daughter.

In 1991, Adam reveals to Erica that they are still married. He blackmails her into staging another wedding ceremony and living with him as his wife. During this marriage, she meets and falls in love with Dimitri Marick (Michael Nader). She fights her feelings for him while he pursues her despite their marriages to other people. Adam eventually grants Erica a divorce, freeing her to be with Dimitri. Erica and Dimitri carry on a long relationship involving two failed marriages and a miscarriage. The pairing was imbued with fairytale elements that were reflected in the wardrobe designs for Erica&#x27;s wedding dresses. Once Erica and Dimitri separate for a final time in 1997, Erica reunites with Jackson. They become engaged right before Mike Roy is revealed to be alive. Erica is torn between them. Though she chooses Jack, she and Mike engage in sex one last time before he leaves Pine Valley. Jack finds out and breaks things off with her.

In 1999, a car accident with David Hayward (Vincent Irizarry) leaves Erica&#x27;s face disfigured. This storyline unintentionally mirrored a similar car accident Lucci was involved in, in 1966 which almost permanently scarred her face. Like Erica, she needed plastic surgery. In the storyline, Erica and David fall in love while he helps her through her recovery. The obstacles designed to come between them are her continued feelings for Dimitri and his inability to fully give himself to a woman because of what happened to his father when he loved his mother too much. They become engaged to be married but Erica calls it off. She next falls in love with Chris Stamp (Jack Scalia). &quot;I really think that she found someone very special in Chris Stamp,&quot; Lucci said. &quot;They are a pretty hot combination, and he seems strong and capable enough of being with her.&quot; In the story, after becoming engaged to Chris, Erica cheats on him with Jack and Chris is killed. She and Jack marry in 2005. They form a family unit including all of their combined children. The union does not last, as they grow apart and Erica cheats on him with Jeff Martin.

&quot;All My Children&quot; hired Mario Van Peebles in 2008 to portray Samuel Woods, Erica&#x27;s new love interest. The writers based the story on Martha Stewart&#x27;s insider trading scandal. Erica buys Chandler Enterprises stock based on privileged information Adam Chandler shares with her. U.S. Attorney, Sam Woods brings charges up against her. They develop an attraction while he prosecutes her and she goes to prison for the crime. The relationship goes no further than dating before Sam leaves Pine Valley to campaign for a seat on the Senate.

Charles Pratt, Jr. took over as head writer of &quot;All My Children&quot; in 2008. The next year, he decided to put Erica and Ryan Lavery (Cameron Mathison) together as a couple. News outlets labeled her a &quot;cougar&quot; since Erica is older than Ryan. Pratt defended the story and said what they have &quot;isn&#x27;t a relationship that&#x27;s borne out of anything except true respect and a growing affection for each other as Erica becomes Ryan&#x27;s pillar of support. [He] offers her an escape from what her life has become, which is digging her various daughters out of trouble.&quot; He described the couple as &quot;a very odd but natural coming together of two people [who are] pushed apart by the attitudes of society.&quot;

On July 25, 2011, Erica stabs David after she escapes from the clutches of her look-alike Jane Campbell that posed as her. She is taken to Oak Haven and there she first sees Janet &quot;from another Planet&quot; Green Dillon, then Annie Lavery, then Marian Colby Chandler, and finally she sees Dixie Cooney Martin. On August 11, 2011, Jane takes the blame for stabbing David so Erica can remain free. During the last few episodes of the show Erica is offered a chance to write a movie about her book (much to the dismay of Jack who wants to marry her). This leads to a falling-out between the two at Stuart Chandler&#x27;s welcome home party. As Jack leaves the party, Erica admits in front of everyone that she needs and loves Jack, to which he replies by bitterly telling her, Rhett Butler-style, that &quot;frankly,&quot; he doesn&#x27;t give a damn about what she needs. &quot;This is not the ending I wanted,&quot; Erica says to Opal. &quot;Oh, you&#x27;ve done it, now you&#x27;ll never get it back,&quot; Opal tells her. &quot;Just watch me,&quot; says Erica. As Erica goes after Jack, JR fires his pistol, ending the show. It is implied that the bullet has hit Erica as she is last to be shown before the screen blacks out.

In a conversation between Kate Howard and Todd Manning on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Erica is mentioned as someone else Todd could have talked to about the job he was offering to Kate, implying she survived the final episode of &quot;All My Children&quot;. On the June 20, 2013 episode of the Prospect Park version of &quot;All My Children&quot;, Opal Cortlandt tells Dimitri Marick, one of Erica&#x27;s ex-husbands that Erica was out of town last seen getting on an airplane to some exotic location without saying when she would be back.

In a 2018 episode of General Hospital Maxie Jones is seen on the phone arguing with someone over a bill, and later warns Nina Clay that Erica Kane might be calling her about Maxie&#x27;s negotiations, suggesting Erica is still alive and working in the fashion industry at this point.

==Cultural impact==
The &quot;Associated Press&quot; reported in 1986 that 60 students at California State University, Fullerton of a group of 100 could recognize Erica Kane but not historical figures such as Alexander Hamilton, Geoffrey Chaucer and Desmond Tutu when asked by English instructor Judith Remy Leder. In 2024, Charlie Mason from &quot;Soaps She Knows&quot; placed Erica at first place on his ranked list of &quot;Soaps&#x27; 40 Most Iconic Characters of All Time&quot;, writing, &quot;Even if you&#x27;d never watched a soap a day in your life, you knew the name of the mercurial supermodel-turned-cosmetics mogul that Susan Lucci played from 1970–2011&quot;.

Susan Lucci hosted the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on October 6, 1990. In one sketch, Lucci played Kane as a contestant on the fictional game show &quot;Game Breakers&quot;. She seduced fictional game show host Jack Morgan (portrayed by Phil Hartman), thus enabling her to soundly beat her opponent. Morgan came close to marrying Kane (in a ceremony presided over by Don Pardo), but the wedding was interrupted by real-life game show host (and &quot;current husband&quot;) Gene Rayburn. The sketch ended with Kane being mauled by a panther owned by Siegfried and Roy (portrayed by Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey).

The Erica Kane character provided inspiration for numerous songs, all of which were named after her. Alternative rock band Urge Overkill titled a song after the character on their album &quot;Saturation&quot;. The late R&amp;B musical artist Aaliyah recorded a song about drug addiction called &quot;Erica Kane&quot;, where the character&#x27;s name was used as a metaphor for a cocaine. The song was released posthumously on the album &quot;I Care 4 U&quot;. The band B5 also recorded a song about Erica Kane titled &quot;Erika Cain.&quot; The song talks about how they&#x27;re in a relationship with a beautiful girl, but she is crazy. The group contacted &quot;All My Children&#x27;s&quot; producers about doing a cameo on the show. They appeared in the April 25, 2008 episode as activists rallying for Erica&#x27;s release from prison. During the appearance, the group performed &quot;Erika Cain.&quot; They also taped a video for the song with Susan Lucci. Rapper Lil&#x27; Kim at times refers to herself as &quot;the black Erica Kane.&quot;
Rapper Speaker Knockerz last release before passing away in 2014 was titled “Erica Kane”.

Mattel created two dolls based on Erica Kane as part of the company&#x27;s Daytime Drama Collection. They released the first one in 1998. Mattel modeled that doll after the character&#x27;s appearance during the Crystal Ball, an annual event in &quot;All My Children&quot;&#x27;s storylines. After that doll met with success, they released the second in 1999 called the Champagne Lace Wedding Erica Kane Doll. This one was based on the character as she was during the 1993 wedding to Dimitri Marick.

Over the years, Susan Lucci became known for gaining Daytime Emmy Award nominations for her portrayal of Erica, but never winning. Almost every year from 1978 to 1998, Lucci received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama series and never won. Her negative reactions to the losses, including pounding her fist on the table and leaving one ceremony in tears, were mentioned in tabloids. Her losses also caused her fellow castmate Ruth Warrick to speak out to the press. In 1983, when Lucci lost to &quot;All My Children&quot; newcomer Dorothy Lyman (Opal), Warrick said, &quot;It seemed impossible that Susan wouldn&#x27;t win this year. We are all very puzzled, amazed, and disgruntled.&quot; She later added, &quot;It was a slap in the face to Susan that Dorothy should walk off with it after being on the show such a short time. And of course her role was so outrageous and so, well, it was a caricature. That&#x27;s not in any way to put down what Dorothy did, but it really was a supporting role rather than a leading role.&quot; The losing streak became a &quot;long-running gag&quot; in the entertainment community. Jay Leno on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; used it as a joke as did &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The author of &quot;The Emmy&quot;, Tom O&#x27;Neil, attributed the losses to the material she submitted for consideration. &quot;In the episodes she sent in last year, she was crying 75 percent of the time,&quot; he said. &quot;She drowned her chances in a tsunami of tears. Lucci eventually won the Daytime Emmy Award in 1999, receiving a two-minute standing ovation at the win and again after the show in the press room. A reporter in the press room questioned whether she would miss the attention she got for losing, to which Lucci responded, &quot;Oh, not for a minute. Winning is definitely better.&quot; The entries Lucci submitted for the 1999 Daytime Emmy Awards involved scenes from Erica&#x27;s storyline where she helps Bianca deal with her anorexia.

<text>Stuart Milton Hodgson OC (April 1, 1924 – December 18, 2015) was the commissioner of the Northwest Territories (NWT) from March 2, 1967 until April 6, 1979.

==Early life==
Hodgson was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, the second son of Allan and Mary Hodgson. In 1940, he began to work for the MacMillan lumber company, then left to join the Royal Canadian Navy between 1942 and 1945, where he took part in the Arctic convoys of World War II. For his service, he received the 1939–1945 Star, Atlantic Star and other World War II medals. 

After his discharge from the military, Hodgson joined the International Woodworkers of America, served with his union local, and attended an International Labour Organization conference in Geneva as part of the Canadian Congress of Labour.

==Northwest Territories==
In 1964, the Canadian federal government appointed Hodgson to the 5th Northwest Territories Legislative Council, and served as deputy commissioner from 1965-67. He then served as commissioner from 1967-79. 

When rapid changes in socio-economic conditions threatened the continuity of Inuit oral history, Commissioner Hodgson urged the taping of elders&#x27; stories. In 1974, the residents of Pangnirtung (since then becoming part of Nunavut) presented the Commissioner with eleven stories which were later compiled into a book. Hodgson was nicknamed &quot;Umingmak&quot; by the Inuit.

Hodgson was one of the founders of the Arctic Winter Games - which began in Yellowknife in 1970 for athletes from Alaska, Yukon, and the NWT – and which now also include Greenland, parts of Arctic Russia, as well as Northern Alberta and Nunavik (Northern Quebec), and the new territory Nunavut which was formed from NWT in 1999. 

The first Commissioner to actually reside in the Northwest Territories, he was a leader in the construction of a semiautonomous, responsible self-government run by residents of the territory.

==Later work and death==
From 1979 to 1981, Hodgson was Canadian co-chairman of the U.S.-Canadian International Joint Commission. He was recruited by Premier William R. Bennett of British Columbia to run BC Ferries for a time in the 1980s.

He was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of the BC Transit in 1985, and appointed as a citizenship judge in British Columbia in December 1997 and served until 2005.

Hodgson died on December 18, 2015, aged 91.

==Honors==
Hodgson was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 18, 1970 for his service to labour and government. Subsequently he received the Queen&#x27;s commemorative medals for her silver, golden, and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012); as well as the Canada 125 medal in 1992.

For his services in the NWT, he was presented the public service&#x27;s Outstanding Achievement Award in 1976. 

The Hodgson Trophy was created and awarded beginning in 1978 for fair play and team spirit during the Arctic Winter Games.

<doc id="654853" wikidata="Q7699929" url="?curid=654853" title="Tenleytown">
<text>Tenleytown is a historic neighborhood in Northwest, Washington, D.C.

==History==
In 1790, locals began calling the neighborhood &quot;Tennally&#x27;s Town&quot; after area tavern owner John Tennally. Over time, the spelling has evolved and by the 19th century the area was commonly known by its current name, although the spelling Tennallytown continued to be used for some time in certain capacities, including streetcars through the 1920s.

The area is the site of Fort Reno, one of the forts that formed a ring around Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War to protect the capital against invasions. It proved to be the crucial lookout point for preventing a siege of Washington, because it is the highest natural elevation point in the District of Columbia.

Fort Reno was decommissioned with the surrender of the Confederate army. The last remains of Fort Reno were removed about 1900, when the land owned by the Dyer family was being prepared for a reservoir.

Due to its elevation it is also the site of the oldest home in Washington, D.C., Charles Jones&#x27;s home, called “The Rest,” is believed to have originally been built around 1700 and significantly expanded around 1800. This home stayed in the Jones family until 1920 when the Magruders (local grocers) bought the home. In 1974, the current family owning the home bought the house and still own it today.

After the American Civil War, what is now Fort Reno Park developed into an African-American community. This community existed in tension with the white residents of Tenleytown, as well as major landholders. Eventually, a coalition of groups persuaded the unelected government of D.C. and the Federal Government to clear the community for segregated neighborhood resources: Deal Middle School, a park, and a water tower. The Reno School building, built in 1903 for African-American students, is one of the few remaining traces of this community. 

Within the park boundaries lies the highest natural point in the District of Columbia, 409 feet above sea level. Fort Reno also hosts community gardens, free rock concerts in the summer, sledding in the winter, and tennis courts, playing fields, and dog-walkers year round. Jackson-Reed HS baseball now uses the ball field for its home games.

Tenleytown was transformed on October 2, 1941, when Sears Roebuck opened its department store on Wisconsin Avenue at Albemarle Street. At the time the store was notable for its size and for its 300-car rooftop parking lot. In the 1990s, Sears abandoned its retail operation at the location and the building was used by Hechinger hardware until its demise in the late 1990s. In the 2000s, the building was converted to a mixed-use development complex called Cityline at Tenley, with luxury condominiums (The Cityline) on the top levels, a Best Buy (later closed and replaced by a Target store) and The Container Store at street level, and an Ace Hardware underground, located within the parking garage that serves the aforementioned stores. The west entrance to the Metro station is at the front of the building across from Whole Foods Market.

In 2010, the Top of the Town: Tenleytown Heritage Trail opened. Starting at the Tenleytown–AU metro station, the trail passes neighborhood landmarks such as American University, Fort Reno Park, and the studios of WRC-TV, Washington&#x27;s NBC-affiliated station.

==Geographic impact==

The neighborhood is home to the highest point in Washington, Fort Reno Park, which houses a baseball field and a soccer field. Due to the high altitude, the neighborhood is home to nearly all of the city&#x27;s radio masts and towers including the studios and/or towers for WRC-TV, WTTG, WUSA, WETA-TV, WHUT-TV, WDCA, WPXW-TV, WJLA-TV, and radio stations WAMU and WTOP-FM. American Tower started to build an even higher tower, 756 feet (about 230 meters) tall, which could support 169 transmitters, but the District of Columbia government reversed its position, and the incomplete tower was demolished in August 2006.

==Transportation==
Tenleytown and adjacent American University Park are served by the Tenleytown–AU stop on the Washington Metro Red Line. American University offers a free shuttle bus between campus and the Tenleytown metro station at 40th and Albemarle Street, runs between the Metro stop and American University&#x27;s main campus. The station is located in the heart of the neighborhood at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Albemarle Street. Metrobus routes 31, 33, 96, D32, H2, H4, M4, N2, W45, and W47 serve the neighborhood, all making stops at the station.

The neighborhood is defined by Tenley Circle which lies at the intersection of Nebraska Avenue, Wisconsin Avenue, and Yuma Street. On Tenley Circle itself is St. Ann&#x27;s Catholic Church, a large imposing stone church which serves area Catholics. On the opposite side of the circle is Wisconsin Avenue Baptist Church. American University&#x27;s Washington College of Law, on the site of the former Immaculata School, also bounds the western edge of the circle.

==Education==
The area is served by the District of Columbia Public Schools.
Tenleytown is zoned to:
*Janney Elementary School
*Alice Deal Middle School
*Jackson-Reed High School

Tenleytown is the location of several independent schools, including National Presbyterian School (PS-6) and Georgetown Day School, whose 2021 campus expansion allowed its lower and middle schools to join the high school in Tenleytown.

The District of Columbia Public Library system operates the Tenley-Friendship Neighborhood Library, whose 2011 building sits at the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and Albemarle Streets.
==Historic landmarks==
Several Tenleytown landmarks are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Residential listings include the N. Webster Chappell House, Dumblane, and Grant Road Historic District. Commercial properties listed on the NRHP include the Sears, Roebuck and Company Department Store and Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company, Cleveland-Emerson Exchange. Religious listings include Convent de Bon Secours, the Immaculata Seminary Historic District, and the Eldbrooke United Methodist Church and its adjoining Methodist Cemetery. There are two educational properties listed on the NRHP: Jackson-Reed High School and Janney Elementary School.

<text>Antonio José Castillo Jiménez (born March 1, 1963) is a Venezuelan former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB), who played for the Toronto Blue Jays, Atlanta Braves, New York Mets and Chicago White Sox. Listed at 5&#x27; 10&quot; , 177 lb. , he batted and threw left-handed.

Castillo played in ten MLB seasons spanning 1988–1998, pitching in 403 games, 218 of them with the Blue Jays. Castillo posted an overall record of 28–23 with a 3.93 ERA and 22 saves, striking out 333 batters while walking 179 in innings of work. Castillo played in four career playoff games, all with Toronto in 1993, posting a 1–0 record with a 5.06 ERA, and helping the Jays win the 1993 World Series.

== Toronto Blue Jays (1988–1989) ==
Castillo signed with the Toronto Blue Jays as an amateur free agent on February 16, 1983, and worked his way through the Blue Jays farm system before making his Major League Baseball debut with the club on August 14, 1988, where he pitched a scoreless inning out of the bullpen in a 6–0 loss to the Kansas City Royals. He earned his first career strikeout against Royals shortstop Kurt Stillwell. On September 3, Castillo earned his first career victory, pitching innings, allowing no hits and walking two batters, while striking out one in a 7–4 win over the Texas Rangers. Castillo played in 14 games with Toronto, going 1–0 with a 3.00 ERA in 15 innings pitched.

Castillo began the 1989 season with the Blue Jays, however, he struggled with the team, going 1–1 with a 6.11 ERA in 17 games. He did earn his first career save on April 16 against the Kansas City Royals, pitching innings of scoreless baseball out of the bullpen in a 15–8 win. On August 24, the Blue Jays traded Castillo and Francisco Cabrera to the Atlanta Braves for Jim Acker.

== Atlanta Braves (1989–1991) ==
Castillo finished the 1989 season with the Atlanta Braves, getting into getting into 12 games with the club, going 0–1 with a 4.82 ERA in innings pitched.

== Detroit Tigers (1992) ==
Castillo ran into injury problems in the 1992 season, and did not play in any games with the Tigers. He then spent some time with their Triple-A affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League, where he was primarily used as a starting pitcher. On October 15, Castillo was granted free agency.

== Toronto Blue Jays (1993–1996) ==
On January 11, 1993, Castillo rejoined his original team, the Blue Jays. Castillo made 51 appearances as part of the bullpen, going 3–2 record with a 3.38 ERA in innings pitched en route to the 1993 American League East title.

Castillo earned the victory in the fourth game of the series, as Toronto won the game 15–14. Overall, Castillo was 1–0 with an ERA of 8.10, allowing three runs in innings, while Toronto won the World Series championship in six games.

Castillo had a very strong 1994 season, going 5–2 with a 2.51 ERA in 68 innings pitched, before the season ended early due to the 1994 strike.

<doc id="654858" wikidata="Q7370653" url="?curid=654858" title="Rottenrow">
<text>The Rottenrow is a street in the Townhead district of Glasgow, Scotland. One of the oldest streets in the city, it underwent heavy redevelopment in the 20th century and now forms part of the University of Strathclyde&#x27;s John Anderson Campus. The street runs along the summit of a drumlin known historically as Balmanno Brae, although this name has long fallen from use.

==History==

The Rottenrow is one of eight streets which formed the medieval burgh of Glasgow. It was recorded as &quot;le Ratonraw de Glasgow&quot; in 1283. The name was once a common one in British towns and cities and literally means &quot;rat row&quot; (from Middle English &quot;ratton raw&quot;), suggesting a tumbledown row of houses infested with rats. The original alignment of Rottenrow stretched from High Street at its east to John Street in the west.

The original premises of the University of Glasgow were situated in the Rottenrow, in a building known as the &quot;Auld Pedagogy&quot;.

Townhead was once a densely populated residential area, but in 1962 the Glasgow Corporation earmarked it for redevelopment as part of its policy of slum clearance. The tenements and other buildings surrounding the Rottenrow were swept away to make room for the new University of Strathclyde, formed in 1964 from the Royal College of Science and Technology, and their inhabitants were moved into high rises. Much of the surrounding street grid was either lost completely or realigned between the new campus buildings. The western section between Montrose and John Streets disappeared after the demolition of John Street Ironworks in the 1950s, the new Engineering Block and Chemistry Block of the Royal College were constructed over this portion in the early 1960s. The western continuation of Rottenrow - a footpath known as Love Loan which ran behind St Paul&#x27;s Church parallel to Martha Street - also disappeared around this period.

Today, the Rottenrow itself is now divided into two sections. The eastern part which starts at High Street is designated &quot;Rottenrow East&quot;, and terminates at Taylor Street where it becomes a pedestrian footpath around the Architecture Building and Wolfson Centre. The western section then continues as &quot;Rottenrow&quot; from North Portland Street to Montrose Street, following the original alignment where it terminates on Montrose Street.

The Rottenrow is perhaps best known as the site of the Royal Maternity Hospital, the birthplace of generations of Glaswegians. Opened in 1860 to replace an older maternity hospital in St Andrew&#x27;s Square, it continued to function until 2001, when it was replaced by the Princess Royal Building at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The University of Strathclyde subsequently purchased and demolished the hospital, turning it into a park, Rottenrow Gardens. A few parts of the building, including the main entrance portico, the arch on North Portland Street, and sections of basement wall were spared destruction. The area&#x27;s heritage is commemorated by a giant metal nappy pin at the centre of the gardens, created by sculptor George Wyllie.

In 2023, the University of Strathclyde reached an agreement with Glasgow City Council to take full possession of the Rottenrow along with neighbouring North Portland Street and Richmond Street. The land, which carried a nominal value of £50,000 was transferred to the university at no cost. The three streets will be pedestrianised, to allow for the expansion of Rottenrow Gardens and to create an uninterrupted public space for students and staff. A new Love Loan is also being created parallel to its original alignment but further south, between John Street and North Frederick Street in 2024.

<text>Mount Bryce is a mountain at the southwestern corner of the Columbia Icefield, in British Columbia, Canada, near the border with Alberta. It can be seen from the Icefields Parkway.

The mountain was named in 1898 by J. Norman Collie after Viscount James Bryce, who was President of the Alpine Club (London) at the time.

Mount Bryce is the fifteenth-highest peak in British Columbia. To the north, it is connected by ridges to the Columbia Icefield. The mountain is rarely climbed due to difficult access although recently built logging roads are alleviating some of the access problems.

<doc id="654863" wikidata="Q3121014" url="?curid=654863" title="Graham Holdings">
<text>Graham Holdings Company (formerly The Washington Post Company) is a diversified American conglomerate holding company. Headquartered in Arlington County, Virginia, and incorporated in Delaware, it was formerly the owner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; newspaper and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine.

Its current holdings include the digital marketing company Code3 (formerly SocialCode); online and print media entities including &quot;Slate Magazine&quot;, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; through the FP Group, which includes &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine and ForeignPolicy.com), Graham Media Group (formerly Post-Newsweek Stations), a group of seven television stations; education company Kaplan; manufacturing operations including Hoover Treated Wood Products, Dekko, Joyce/Dayton Corp, Forney Corporation; Graham Healthcare Group, which provides home health, hospice and palliative care services through joint ventures with health systems and physicians groups as well as other services; Graham Automotive, which includes eight automotive dealerships around the Washington, D.C. region; and content and marketplace company World of Good Brands (formerly Leaf Group). Graham Holdings Company also owned cable television and internet service provider Cable One until it was spun off in 2015 

==Corporate history==
The history of Graham Holdings Company dates back to 1877, when &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was first published. The Washington Post Company was incorporated in the District of Columbia in 1889, and remained a District of Columbia corporation until it changed its place of incorporation to Delaware in 2003. It is a public company and its Class B common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GHC; it went public in 1971.

Descendants of the late Eugene Meyer (including Chairman Donald E. Graham, his sister Lally Weymouth, and the beneficiaries of various family trusts) collectively control the company through their ownership of the unlisted Class A common stock that selects 70% of the company&#x27;s board of directors. it forms more than 90% of the family&#x27;s assets. Prior to 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was a substantial holder of the public Class B common stock that selects 30% of the company&#x27;s board of directors, but exchanged most of that stock for WPLG-TV, one of Graham Holdings&#x27; television stations, and other assets, in 2014.

Since 1950, the company had been based in the Washington Post building in Washington, D.C., which was sold off separately in 2014. Its new headquarters are at 1300 North 17th Street in Arlington, Virginia, with the choice of state motivated (according to Don Graham) by the proximity to Congress and the fact that two of the holding&#x27;s activity areas, education and health care, are subject to federal regulation.

In 1984, The Washington Post Company purchased Stanley H. Kaplan Education Centers, Ltd., a Brooklyn-based tutoring company which in subsequent decades would grow its footprint and expand its offerings beyond test prep to become Kaplan, Inc.

On August 5, 2013, it was announced that the Washington Post Company would sell the flagship newspaper for $250 million to Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon.com. The Washington Post Company agreed to adopt a new corporate name once the sale was finalized. It adopted Graham Holdings Company as the new name effective November 29, 2013. Amazon.com was not involved in the sale. Nash Holdings LLC, a company owned by Bezos, closed the purchase of the newspaper and affiliated publications on October 1, 2013. Graham Holdings Company retained ownership of WaPo Labs, its technology innovation group, since rebranded as Trove.

In 2014, Tim O&#x27;Shaughnessy, founder of LivingSocial and a son-in-law of CEO Don Graham, joined GHC as president. O&#x27;Shaughnessy became CEO in November 2015.

<text>The Saturn I was a rocket designed as the United States&#x27; first medium lift launch vehicle for up to low Earth orbit payloads. Its development was taken over from the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1958 by the newly formed civilian NASA. Its design proved sound and flexible. It was successful in initiating the development of liquid hydrogen-fueled rocket propulsion, launching the Pegasus satellites, and flight verification of the Apollo command and service module launch phase aerodynamics. Ten Saturn I rockets were flown before it was replaced by the heavy lift derivative Saturn IB, which used a larger, higher total impulse second stage and an improved guidance and control system. It also led the way to development of the super-heavy lift Saturn V which carried the first men to landings on the Moon in the Apollo program.

President John F. Kennedy identified the Saturn I, and the SA-5 launch in particular, as being the point where US lift capability would surpass the Soviets, after being behind since Sputnik.

==History==

===Origins===
The Saturn project was started as one of a number of proposals to meet a new Department of Defense (DoD) requirement for a heavy-lift vehicle to orbit a new class of communications and &quot;other&quot; satellites. The requirements called for a vehicle capable of putting into orbit, or accelerating to trans-lunar injection. Existing U.S. launchers could place a maximum of about in orbit, but might be expanded to as much as with new high-energy upper stages. In any event, these upper stages would not be available until 1961 at the earliest, and would still not meet the DoD requirements for heavy loads.

Wernher von Braun&#x27;s team at the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) started studying the problem in April 1957. They calculated that a rocket with the required performance would require a lower-stage booster with a thrust of about 1.5 million pound-force (6.7 MN) thrust at takeoff. As it happened, the Air Force had recently started work on just such an engine, eventually emerging as the F-1. But the F-1 would not be available in the time frame that the DoD was demanding and would be limited to about 1 million lbf in the short term anyway. Another possibility was a Rocketdyne engine, then known as the E-1, which provided about , four of which would reach the required thrust levels. This approach became the favorite and was paired with a first stage built from a cluster of nine tanks placed atop a thrust plate where the engines and plumbing would be attached. The design envisaged eight rocket tanks similar to the Redstone stage strapped around a central larger tank derived from a Jupiter rocket. The design and diameter similarities would enable the use of the same tooling and facilities used to produce the older tanks, speeding up the design and production phases of the new stage. Contrary to what was reported to the press at the time (and propagated commonly ever since), the tanks were not simply Redstone and Jupiter tanks, but much longer versions built anew at the same diameter. However, the perception was that the first stage was a cluster of propellant tanks engineered from older rocket designs, leading critics to jokingly refer to it as &quot;Cluster&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, a play on the nickname for the Battle of the Little Bighorn, &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;. 

Von Braun returned the design to DoD in December 1957 as &quot;A National Integrated Missile and Space Vehicle Development Program&quot;, outlining the new design, then known simply as &quot;Super-Jupiter&quot;. Several variations were proposed, using a common clustered first stage, and upper stages based on either the Atlas or Titan I. ABMA favored the Titan as the Atlas production was extremely high-priority and there was little or no excess capacity to spare. They proposed using the existing Titan tooling at diameter, but lengthening it to produce a new -long stage. A Centaur would be used as a third stage, which was expected to be ready for operational use in 1963, right when the lower two stages would have completed their testing. The resulting three-stage design was much taller and skinnier than the Saturn design that was eventually built.

Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was formed in February 1958 as part of DoD and was in charge of the requirements. ARPA asked for only one change to the design; concerned that the E-1 was still in early development, they suggested looking at alternatives in order to ensure the rocket would enter production as soon as possible. ABMA quickly responded with a slightly modified design replacing the four E-1&#x27;s with eight H-1 engines, a minor upgrade to the S-3D engine used on Thor and Jupiter missiles. They estimated that changing the engines would save about $60 million and as much as two years of research and development time.

von Braun had earlier referred to Redstone and Jupiter rockets being used as space launchers as the Juno I and Juno II, respectively, and had submitted proposals for multi-stage versions as the Juno III and IV. He changed the name of the new design to Juno V. The total development cost of $850 million ($5.6 billion in year-2007 dollars) between 1958 and 1963 also covered 30 research and development flights, some carrying crewed and uncrewed space payloads.

===Work begins===
Satisfied with the outcome, ARPA Order Number 14-59, dated 15 August 1958, ordered the program into existence:

:Initiate a development program to provide a large space vehicle booster of approximately 1,500,000-lb. thrust based on a cluster of available rocket engines. The immediate goal of this program is to demonstrate a full-scale captive dynamic firing by the end of CY 1959.

This was followed on 11 September 1958 with another contract with Rocketdyne to start work on the H-1. On 23 September 1958, ARPA and the Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) drew up an additional agreement enlarging the scope of the program, stating &quot;In addition to the captive dynamic firing..., it is hereby agreed that this program should now be extended to provide for a propulsion flight test of this booster by approximately September 1960&quot;. Further, they wanted ABMA to produce three additional boosters, the last two of which would be &quot;capable of placing limited payloads in orbit&quot;.

von Braun had high hopes for the design, feeling it would make an excellent test-bed for other propulsion systems, notably the F-1 if it matured. He outlined uses for the Juno V as a general carrier vehicle for research and development of &quot;offensive and defensive space weapons&quot;. Specific uses were forecast for each of the military services, including navigation satellites for the Navy; reconnaissance, communications, and meteorological satellites for the Army and Air Force; support for Air Force crewed missions; and surface-to-surface logistics supply for the Army at distances up to 6400 kilometers. von Braun also proposed using the Juno V as the basis of a crewed lunar mission as part of Project Horizon. Juno could lift up to 20,000 pounds (9,000 kg) into low Earth orbit, and he proposed launching 15 of them to build a lunar spacecraft in Earth orbit.

Even by this point the name &quot;Saturn&quot;, as &quot;the one after Jupiter&quot; was being used. One early ARPA report noted: &quot;The SATURN is considered to be the first real space vehicle as the Douglas DC-3 was the first real airliner and durable work-horse in aeronautics&quot;. The name change became official in February 1959.

===Transfer to NASA===
The formation of NASA on 29 July 1958 led to an effort to collect the existing heavy-launch rocket programs and select a single set of designs for future work. At the time, both the Air Force and US Army had teams developing such vehicles, the Army&#x27;s Saturn and the Air Force&#x27;s Space Launching System (SLS). The SLS used a set of common modular components with solid fuel boosters and hydrogen/oxygen upper stages to allow a wide variety of launch configurations and payload weights. Both groups had also developed plans for crewed lunar bases, ABMA&#x27;s Horizon with its Earth Orbit Rendezvous method of building a large lunar rocket in Earth orbit, and the Air Force&#x27;s Lunex Project which planned on launching a single huge lander using the largest of the SLS configurations. As if this were not enough, NASA&#x27;s own engineers had started the design of their own Nova design series, planning to use it in the direct ascent profile similar to the Air Force&#x27;s approach.

Von Braun was asked to chair a committee to study the existing efforts and write up recommendations. The committee presented their report on 18 July 1958, starting with a criticism of how the US program had been mishandled to date and pointing out that the Soviet program was definitely ahead. It went on to describe five &quot;generations&quot; of rockets, starting with the early Vanguard, through the Juno, ICBMs like Atlas and Titan, clustered designs like the Saturn, and finally, the ultimate development, a cluster using the F-1 with of thrust. The report went on to outline a crewed exploration program using these rockets as they become available; using existing ICBMs a small four-man space station could be operational 1961, the clusters would support a crewed lunar landing in 1965-1966 and a larger 50-man space station by 1967, while the largest of the rockets would support large Moon expeditions in 1972, set up a permanent Moon base in 1973–1974, and launch crewed interplanetary trips in 1977.

In December 1958, all of the teams gathered to present their designs. NASA selected von Braun&#x27;s proposal on 6 January 1959, giving it a vital boost. At the end of January, NASA outlined their complete development program. This included the Vega and Centaur upper stages, as well as the Juno V and their own Nova boosters. Vega was later cancelled when information on the formerly secret Agena upper stage was released (then known as &quot;Hustler&quot;), and it had performance roughly comparable to NASA&#x27;s design.

===Near-cancellation===
Progress on the Saturn design seemed to go smoothly. In April 1959, the first H-1 engines started arriving at ABMA, and test firings started in May. Construction of the Complex 34 launch sites started at Cape Canaveral in June.

Then, quite unexpectedly, on 9 June 1959, Herbert York, Director of Department of Defense Research and Engineering, announced that he had decided to terminate the Saturn program. He later stated that he was concerned that the project was taking ARPA money from more pressing projects, and that as it seemed upgrades to existing ICBMs would provide the needed heavy-lift capability in the short term. As ABMA commander John B. Medaris put it:

:By this time, my nose was beginning to sniff a strange odor of &quot;fish&quot;. I put my bird dogs to work to try to find out what was going on and with whom we had to compete. We discovered that the Air Force had proposed a wholly different and entirely new vehicle as the booster for Dynasoar, using a cluster of Titan engines and upgrading their performance to get the necessary first-stage thrust for take-off. This creature was variously christened the Super Titan, or the Titan C. No work had been done on this vehicle other than a hasty engineering outline. Yet the claim was made that the vehicle in a two-stage or three-stage configuration could be flown more quickly than the Saturn, on which we had already been working hard for many months. Dates and estimates were attached to that proposal which at best ignored many factors of costs, and at worst were strictly propaganda.

Looking to head off the cancellation, Saturn supporters from the DoD and ARPA drafted their own memo arguing against the cancellation. Working against them was the fact that neither the Army nor NASA had any in-writing requirement for the booster at that time. A three-day meeting between 16 and 18 September 1959 followed, where York and Dryden reviewed Saturn&#x27;s future and discussed the roles of the Titan C and Nova. The outcome was equally unexpected; York agreed to defer the cancellation and continue short-term funding, but only if NASA agreed to take over the ABMA team and continue development without the help of the DoD. NASA was equally concerned that by relying on third parties for their boosters they were putting their entire program in jeopardy, and were very open to the idea of taking over the team.

As the parties continued discussions over the next week an agreement was hammered out; von Braun&#x27;s team at ABMA would be kept together and continue working as the lead developers of Saturn, but the entire organization would be transferred to NASA&#x27;s management. By a presidential executive order on 15 March 1960, ABMA became NASA&#x27;s George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).

=== Selecting the upper stages===
In July 1959, a change request was received from ARPA to upgrade the upper stage to a much more powerful design using four new liquid hydrogen / liquid oxygen powered engines in a larger-diameter second stage, with an upgraded Centaur using two engines of the same design for the third stage. On this change Medaris noted:

:For reasons of economy we had recommended, and it had been approved, that in building the second stage, we would use the same diameter as the Titan first stage120 inches. The major costs of tooling for the fabrication of missile tanks and the main structure is related to the diameter. Changes in length cost little or nothing in tooling. How the tanks are divided internally, or the structure reinforced inside, or the kind of structural detail that is used at the end in order to attach the structure to a big booster below, or to a different size stage above, have very little effect on tooling problems. However, a change in diameter sets up a major question of tools, costs, and time.

:Suddenly, out of the blue came a directive to suspend work on the second stage, and a request for a whole new series of cost and time estimates, including consideration of increasing the second stage diameter to 160 inches. It appeared that Dr. York had entered the scene, and had pointed up the future requirements of Dynasoar as being incompatible with the 120-inch diameter. He had posed the question of whether it was possible for the Saturn to be so designed as to permit it to be the booster for that Air Force project.

:We were shocked and stunned. This was no new problem, and we could find no reason why it should not have been considered, if necessary, during the time that the Department of Defense and NASA were debating the whole question of what kind of upper stages we should use. Nevertheless, we very speedily went about the job of estimating the project on the basis of accepting the 160-inch diameter. At the same time, it was requested that we submit quotations for a complete operational program to boost the Dynasoar for a given number of flights. As usual, we were given two or three numbers, rather than one fixed quantity, and asked to estimate on each of them.

In order to reach some sort of accommodation, a group pulled from NASA, Air Force, ARPA, ABMA, and the Office of the Department of Defense Research and Engineering formed under the Silverstein Committee in December. von Braun was skeptical of liquid hydrogen as an upper stage fuel, but the Committee convinced him that it was the way to go on future upper stage development. Once these changes had been made, NASA&#x27;s booster project was now entirely free of any dependence on military developments. At that point any sort of upper stage was fair game, and &quot;If these propellants are to be accepted for the difficult top-stage applications&quot;, the committee concluded, &quot;there seem to be no valid engineering reasons for not accepting the use of high-energy propellants for the less difficult application to intermediate stages&quot;.

The Committee outlined a number of different potential launch configurations, grouped into three broad categories. The &quot;A&quot; group were low-risk versions similar to the Saturn designs proposed prior to the meeting; the original design using Titan and Centaur upper stages became the A-1, while another model replacing the Titan with a cluster of IRBMs became A-2. The B-1 design proposed a new second stage replacing the A-2s cluster with a new four-engine design using the H-1 like the lower stage. Finally, there were three C-series models that replaced all of the upper stages with liquid hydrogen ones. The C-1 used the existing S-I clustered lower, adding the new S-IV stage with four new engines, and keeping the two-engine Centaur on top, now to be known as the S-V stage. The C-2 model added a new S-III stage with two new engines, keeping the S-IV and S-V on top. Finally, the C-3 configuration added the S-II stage with four of these same engines, keeping only the S-III and S-IV on top. The C models easily outperformed the A&#x27;s and B&#x27;s, with the added advantage that they were interchangeable and could be built up in order to fit any needed payload requirement.

===Saturn emerges===
Of these new stage designs, only the S-IV would ever be delivered, and not in the form that was drawn up in the Committee report. In order to meet development schedules a cluster of six Centaur engines were placed in the new stage to produce the &quot;new&quot; S-IV of roughly the same performance as the original four upgraded engines. A large number of small engines are less efficient and more problematic than a smaller number of large engines, and this made it a target for an early upgrade to a single J-2. The resulting stage, the S-IVB, improved performance so much that the Saturn was able to launch the Apollo CSM, proving invaluable during the Apollo Project.

In the end, the Titan C was never delivered, and the Air Force instead turned to &quot;thrust augmented&quot; Titan IIs using clustered solid-fuel rockets. These new designs, the Titan IIIs, became the DoD&#x27;s main heavy-lift launch vehicle for decades afterward as it cost significantly less to manufacture and fly, in part due to using hypergolic propellants that could be stored at room temperature. An important factor in this decision was that the DoD preferred to have a launch vehicle that they were in complete control of instead of having to share the Saturn with NASA (of all Titan III/IV vehicles launched during its 40-year run, only a handful carried NASA payloads). Likewise, the development of the Titan III eliminated the need for the &quot;flexible&quot; staging concepts of the Saturn, which was now only intended to be used for crewed launches in the Apollo program. With the need for flexibility in launch configuration removed, most of these designs were subsequently dropped. Only the S-V survived in its original form, while the S-IV would appear in modified form and the Saturn V would feature an entirely different S-II stage.

The Saturn I made its maiden flight on 27 October 1961 with a dummy upper stage and partially fueled first stage. Tension in the blockhouse was high as no launch vehicle to date had been successful on the first attempt and there was the widespread fear of a pad explosion. As the Saturn was the largest booster yet flown, such an event was sure to be extremely destructive, possibly putting the launch complex out of use for six months.

In the end, however, these worries subsided as the booster lifted and performed a flawless test flight. Three more flights with dummy upper stages followed over the next 17 months, which were all completely or mostly successful. Two of them had the S-IV filled with water and detonated at high altitude after stage separation to form an ice cloud that was then photographed.

Flight #5 in January 1964 was the first to carry a live S-IV, which restarted its engine in orbit to boost to a high altitude where it would remain until decaying two years later. Another two flights followed during the year with boilerplate Apollo CSMs.

By this point, however, the advent of the Titan III had robbed the Saturn of a role as a DoD launcher and with the newer, improved Saturn IB in development (as the Apollo CSM ended up being heavier than originally expected and so needed a more powerful launch vehicle), the booster quickly became orphaned and no practical use could be found for it.

==Uses in service==
The main payload of the Saturn I was the boilerplate version of the Apollo Command and Service Modules and Launch Escape System. The final three also carried Pegasus micrometeoroid satellites in the second stage-spacecraft adapter.

The Saturn I was considered for launch of the X-20 Dyna-Soar spaceplane, and later, for launching a Gemini capsule on a proposed circumlunar mission.
With funding of the Dyna-Soar cut in 1963 and Apollo development already far progressed, these proposals were however never realized.

Much later, Saturn I was also considered as a short range ballistic missile system in the TABAS concept. TABAS armed the Saturn with of conventional weapons in a mechanical carrier system that ensured that the missile would hit and destroy an enemy runway, knocking it out of action for three days. The system was considered too dangerous to deploy; when launched it would appear to be a nuclear strike and might invite a response-in-kind.

==Description==

===Specifications===
The S-V third stage was developed as the Centaur rocket stage, It was flown inactively four times on the Saturn I with the tanks filled with water. It never flew an active mission. The S-V would become an upper stage for the Atlas-Centaur and Titan III launch vehicles and their derivatives.

===S-I stage===


The S-I first stage was powered by eight H-1 rocket engines burning RP-1 fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX) as oxidizer. The propellant tanks consisted of a central Jupiter rocket tank containing LOX, surrounded by a cluster of eight Redstone rocket tanks: four painted white, containing LOX; and four painted black, containing the RP-1 fuel. The four outboard engines were mounted on gimbals, allowing them to be steered to guide the rocket. On the Block II vehicles (SA-5 through SA-10), eight fins provided aerodynamic stability in the flight through the atmosphere.

===S-IV stage===


The S-IV second stage was powered by six RL10 rocket engines burning liquid hydrogen (LH2) as fuel with LOX as oxidizer, mounted on gimbals. The propellant tanks used a single, common bulkhead to separate the LOX and LH2 propellant tanks, saving 20% of structural weight along with the associated length and complexity of construction.

===Saturn I Instrument Unit===

Saturn I Block I vehicles (SA-1 to SA-4) were guided by instruments carried in canisters on top of the S-I first stage, and included the ST-90 stabilized platform, made by Ford Instrument Company and used in the Redstone missile. These first four vehicles followed ballistic, non-orbital trajectories, and the dummy upper stages did not separate from the single powered stage.

The Block II vehicles (SA-5 to SA-10) included two powered stages, and went into orbits. Beginning with SA-5, the guidance instruments were carried on the instrument unit (IU), just ahead of the S-IV stage. The first version of the IU was in diameter and high, and was both designed and built by Marshall Space Flight Center. Guidance, telemetry, tracking, and power components were contained in four pressurized, cylindrical containers attached like spokes to a central hub. This version flew on SA-5, SA-6, and SA-7.

MSFC flew version 2 of the IU on SA-8, SA-9, and SA-10. Version 2 was the same diameter as version 1, but only high. Instead of pressurized containers, the components were hung on the inside of the cylindrical wall, achieving a reduction in weight.

The guidance computer for Block II was the IBM ASC-15. Other instruments carried by the IU included active components, that guided the vehicle; and passenger components, that telemetered data to the ground for test and evaluation for use in later flights. The ST-90 stabilized platform was the active IMU for SA-5 and the first stage of SA-6. The ST-124 was the passenger on SA-5 and active for the second stage of SA-6 and subsequent missions. The IU had an optical window to allow alignment of the inertial platform before launch.

=== S-V stage ===
The S-V stage was intended to be powered by two RL-10A-1 engines burning liquid hydrogen as fuel and liquid oxygen as oxidizer. The propellant tanks used a common bulkhead to separate the propellants. The S-V stage was flown four times on missions SA-1 through SA-4; all four of these missions had the S-V&#x27;s tanks filled with water to be used a ballast during launch. The stage was never flown in an active configuration on any Saturn launch vehicle. This stage was also used on the Atlas-LV3C as the Centaur, modern derivatives of which are still flown today, making it the only Saturn rocket stage still currently operating.

==Saturn I rockets on display==
, there are three locations where Saturn I test vehicles (or parts thereof) are on display:

===Block 1 test vehicles===
SA-T First Saturn I Static Test stage. Manufactured at Marshall Space Flight Center, used in several MSFC static firing tests from 1960, then shipped and used at the Michoud Assembly Facility for fit testing, before being returned to Alabama. Now on horizontal display, next to the static test tower at Marshall Space Flight Center. In 2019, it was reported that this stage has been made available by NASA for donation to an organization, with the only provision being an approximately $250,000 &quot;shipping fee&quot; for transportation costs.

With apparently no inquiries by qualified institutions to obtain the SA-T stage, the booster was demolished on or around April 4, 2022.SA-D Saturn I Block 1 Dynamic Test Vehicle. Manufactured at MSFC, used in several MSFC dynamic tests through 1962. Now on display in a vertical position with dummy upper stage in the rocket garden near MSFC headquarters, alongside several examples of heritage vehicles such as the V-2 rocket (A4), Redstone, Jupiter-C and Jupiter IRBM. 

===Block 2 test vehicle===
SA-D5 Block 2 Dynamic Test Vehicle - consists of S-I-D5 Booster stage and S-IV-H/D hydrostatic/dynamic upper stage, used in tests at MSFC dynamic stand in 1962. It was also shipped and used for checkout at LC-37B at Cape Canaveral in 1963. It was returned to Alabama and modified for use as an S-IB dynamic test stage. Donated by NASA/MSFC to the State of Alabama at the same time as the Saturn V dynamic test vehicle and now on display in a vertical position at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center (formerly Alabama Space and Rocket Center), Huntsville, Alabama, where it has become a very familiar local landmark.

<text>The S-IV was the second stage of the Saturn I rocket used by NASA for early flights in the Apollo program.

The S-IV was manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company and later modified by them to the S-IVB, a similar but distinct stage used on the Saturn IB and Saturn V rockets.

The S-IV stage was a large LOX/LH2-fueled rocket stage used for the early test flights of the Saturn I rocket. It formed the second stage of the Saturn I and was powered by a cluster of six RL-10A-3 engines. Each one of the engines supplied of thrust for a total of about . The cryogenic LH2 (liquid hydrogen) and LOX (liquid oxygen) tanks were separated by a common bulkhead. The forward bulkhead of the LOX tank formed the aft bulkhead of the LH2 tank. This saved up to 20% of structural weight.

In November 1995, Reeves abruptly left &quot;Days of Our Lives.&quot; Rumors began to circulate when she didn&#x27;t attend the 30th anniversary party for &quot;Days&quot;. In a statement, Reeves said, &quot;I&#x27;m at a point in my life where I need to spend more time with my husband Scott, and our daughter.&quot; Soap Opera Digest reported that Reeves leaving &quot;Days&quot; disrupted plans for a spinoff involving her character, Jennifer. Reeves&#x27; final airdate was December 15, 1995. The role was recast with Stephanie Cameron, who began airing on December 19. Kimberley Simms, Jessica Tuck, and Karen Witter had reportedly been considered to replace Reeves. Corday Productions and Sony Entertainment sued Reeves for breach of contract. The lawsuit was settled out of court with Reeves paying an unspecified sum, which &quot;Days&quot; Executive Producer Ken Corday donated to pediatric HIV/AIDS research. 

In 1999, Reeves and her husband, Scott Reeves, co-starred in the ABC television film &quot;Half a Dozen Babies&quot;. The movie was based on the true story of the Dilley sextuplets, with the Reeves playing their parents.

The role of Jennifer was recast with Cady McClain. This followed criticism Reeves received from some fans, as well as her co-stars Lamon Archey and Linsey Godfrey, for &#x27;liking&#x27; social media posts by conservative commentator Candace Owens which denounced the Black Lives Matter movement. Reeves had previously drawn criticism in 2012 for expressing support for fast-food chain Chick-fil-A during a controversy over its chief operating officer declaring the chain&#x27;s stance against same-sex marriage.

<doc id="654885" wikidata="Q4579829" url="?curid=654885" title="Anacostia">
<text>Anacostia is a historic neighborhood in Southeast Washington, D.C. Its downtown is located at the intersection of Marion Barry Avenue (formerly Good Hope Road) SE and the neighborhood contains commercial and government buildings, mid-rise mixed development, city-sanctioned art murals and galleries (under the &quot;Art to Go Go&quot; initiative), a performing arts center, a playhouse theater, the local landmark, &quot;The Big Chair,&quot; Fredrick Douglass&#x27;s Home (a museum and historic site) and is adjacent to the Fort Stanton Park neighborhood which hosts the Smithsonian Anacostia Community Museum. It is located directly east of and along the Anacostia River, after which the neighborhood is named.

Bounded by the Southeast Freeway to the north and northwest, the Suitland Parkway to the south and southwest as well as Fort Stanton and Ricketts Park to the east, Anacostia includes all of the Anacostia Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Frederick Douglass National Historic Site preserves the famous 19th century civil rights leader&#x27;s home. The Anacostia Community Museum is part of the Smithsonian. Often the name &quot;Anacostia&quot; is used to refer to the entire portion of the city that is southeast of the Anacostia River. The Anacostia Business Improvement District is responsible for the development of the area.

==History==
The name &quot;Anacostia&quot; comes from the anglicized name of a Nacochtank settlement along the Anacostia River. Archaeological evidence indicates that American Indians settled in the Washington, D.C., area at least 4,000 years ago, close to the Anacostia River. Native inhabitants within the present-day District of Columbia included the Nacotchtank, at Anacostia, who were affiliated with the Conoy.

Captain John Smith explored the area in 1608, traveling up the &quot;Eastern Branch&quot;—later the Anacostia River—mistaking it for the main body of the Potomac River, and met Anacostans. Before the arrival of whites, the Nacostine villages in this area were a lively center of trade visited by Native Americans such as the Iroquois of New York. Even after the founding of Maryland, Leonard Calvert, in a letter to a merchant in London, described &quot;Anacostan&quot; as one of the three best places in the colony for trading with natives.

Around the year 1668, native peoples previously living south of Anacostia were forced northward by war. Anacostine Island, which first appeared on a 1670 map drawn by Augustine Herman, was settled by the Anacostans around this time.

The core of what is now the Anacostia historic district was incorporated in 1854 as Uniontown and was one of the early suburbs in the District of Columbia. It was designed to be affordable for Washington&#x27;s working class, many of whom were employed across the river at the Navy Yard; its (then) location outside of and isolated from the city made its real estate inexpensive. The initial subdivision of 1854 carried restrictive covenants prohibiting the sale, rental or lease of property to anyone of African or Irish descent. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, often called &quot;the sage of Anacostia&quot;, bought Cedar Hill, the estate belonging to the developer of Uniontown, in 1877 and lived there until he died in 1895. The home is still maintained as the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site in Anacostia.

During the Civil War, Anacostia was protected by a series of forts upon the hills southwest of the city. Following the conclusion of the war, the forts were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners.

Anacostia, always part of the District of Columbia, became a part of the city of Washington when the city and District became in 1878.
On January 27, 1886, the House of Representatives Committee on the District of Columbia voted in favor of renaming Uniontown to Anacostia. After the bill passed the House of Representatives, the Senate also voted in favor of the name change. The name change became effective on April 22, 1886. At the time, property deeds restricted land ownership to people who were white, and therefore Anacostia had only white residents.

The opening of the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge in 1890 began to link Anacostia to the rest of the District of Columbia.

===Great Depression===

In 1932, during the Great Depression, unemployed World War I veterans from all across the country marched on Washington to demand immediate payment of a bonus promised to them. The event became known as the Bonus Army Conflict. Most of the Bonus Army camped on Anacostia Flats, a swampy, muddy area along the Anacostia River later reclaimed as Anacostia Park/Fairlawn Park. Fearing civil unrest, the President ordered the military to disperse the campers from Washington. The Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur dispersed them, but exceeded the orders of President Herbert Hoover by crossing the bridge to Anacostia and torching the veteran&#x27;s encampment. MacArthur believed that the Bonus Army was composed of and led by Communists. George Patton and Dwight Eisenhower served under MacArthur during these events.

===Post-war years===
Anacostia&#x27;s population remained predominantly white and European-American up until the late 1950s and early 1960s, with whites comprising 87% of the population. During the 1960s, the Anacostia Freeway (I-295) was constructed. The highway imposed a barrier between the Anacostia neighborhood and the Anacostia River waterfront. Numerous public housing apartment complexes were built in the neighborhood. With the flight of much of the white middle class out of the neighborhood during the late 1950s and 1960s due to desegregation measures taking place, Anacostia&#x27;s demographics changed dramatically as the neighborhood became predominantly African American. Interactions between the area&#x27;s white and black residents were often contentious, as was the case in the 1949 Anacostia riot at a desegregated public pool.

Shopping, dining, and entertainment facilities throughout greater Anacostia are limited, as development slowed with a decrease in income in the area. Residents often must travel to either the suburbs or downtown Washington for these services. Anacostia, however, does have a year-round ice skating rink at Fort Dupont Park; the city police boys&#x27; club; and a tennis and learning center, combining sports with academic tutoring in Congress Heights.

St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital, D.C. Village and the Blue Plains sewage treatment plant were long-established Anacostia developments noted in a late-1990s report. The report also cited attention to the area at that time from Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich.

In 2005, Building Bridges Across the River opened the 110,000-square-foot (10,000 m2) Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus (THEARC) which is home to eleven nonprofit organizations, all of which share the goal of helping children and adults reach their full potential. Free summer evening jazz concerts are also given weekly in Fort Dupont Park. The annual Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday Parade is a notable annual event along the Avenue bearing Dr. King&#x27;s name. Starting in 2006 the annual parade date was changed from January to April. (Also see the separate article on Congress Heights). In January 2007 a new large supermarket opened to serve the neighborhood.

==Geography==
Anacostia downtown is located at the intersection of Marion Barry Avenue (formerly Good Hope Road) and Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. It is the most famous neighborhood in the Southeast quadrant of Washington, located east of the Anacostia River, after which the neighborhood is named.

==Demographics==
As of the 2010 Census, Anacostia&#x27;s population is 92% African-American, 5% Non-Hispanic White, and 3% other.

==Landmarks==
The Anacostia Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, and it retains much of its mid-to-late 19th-century low-scale, working-class character, as is evident in its architecture.

In 1957, an Anacostia landmark, the &quot;world&#x27;s largest chair&quot;, was installed at the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue and V Street SE. The chair was installed by the Curtis Brothers Furniture Company and built by Bassett Furniture. In the summer of 2005, the &quot;Big Chair&quot; was removed for repairs, then returned in April 2006.

==Industry==
Notable facilities in the area include Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling (formerly Bolling Air Force Base and Naval Support Facility Anacostia).

== Tourism ==
Founded in 2000, the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative is revitalizing a piece of the Anacostia River waterfront to promote the community. Plans include numerous parks restored of their natural wetlands and forests, canoe tie-ups, a playground, a four-acre 9/11 memorial grove, and an environmental education center. The center provides visitors with education about the history and use of the Anacostia River through a , two-story complex topped by a green roof/nursery center with classrooms, labs, and a multipurpose area beneath. Studios Architecture was chosen to be the architect of the project, while the administrating agency will be the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation.

===Cultural reference===
In the 2007 film inspired by the life of Ralph Waldo &#x27;Petey&#x27; Greene (played by Don Cheadle), Greene&#x27;s straightlaced counterpart Dewey Hughes played by Chiwetel Ejiofor surprises all with his skill at &#x27;9 ball&#x27; pool. &quot;Grew up in the Anacostia projects ... [and] made [my] way through school hustling&quot;, he explains about himself after their game in &quot;Talk to Me&quot;. The film is set in the late 1960s.

==Transportation==
The neighborhood, served by the Anacostia Metro station, is a 10-minute ride on Washington Metro&#x27;s Green Line from downtown Washington; other Metro stations on the Green and Orange lines serve other parts of Greater Anacostia.

I-295 runs through the neighborhood; it connects to DC 295 further north, and these two routes make up the entire routing of the Anacostia Freeway.

<doc id="654892" wikidata="Q1419644" url="?curid=654892" title="Just Shoot Me!">
<text>Just Shoot Me! is an American sitcom television series that originally aired on NBC from March 4, 1997, to November 26, 2003, with a total of 145 half-hour episodes spanning seven seasons, including 3 episodes aired on syndication. The show, created by Steven Levitan, one of the show&#x27;s executive producers, is set in the office of a fictional fashion magazine called &quot;Blush&quot;, comparable to the real-life magazine &quot;Vogue&quot;. The show&#x27;s story revolves around several staff members at the magazine, including Jack Gallo, the owner and publisher; his daughter Maya, a writer for the magazine; secretary Finch; former model and now-fashion correspondent Nina; and photographer Elliot.

==Series history==
Early on, the series was a very competitive hit, consistently winning its time slot. The first season of six episodes was all aired by NBC in a single month in March 1997. It was renewed for a 13-episode second season and fitted at 9:30 p.m. after &quot;Frasier&quot;, and then was moved in the spring to Thursdays between &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. After just two of these airings, the order was bumped up to a full season. When &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ended in 1998, &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; was one of the contenders to take the coveted 9:00 p.m. Thursday slot. &quot;Frasier&quot; instead won the slot, and &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; was instead given &quot;Frasier&quot;″s 9:00 p.m. Tuesday slot.
&quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; was never given a definitive time slot during its series run. The show ended up being moved around on the NBC schedule. It still retained good ratings, though; in its fourth season, it was the top-rated show for NBC Tuesday nights and had an average rating/share of 6.1/16 in the 18–49 demographic.

==Characters==
===Maya Gallo===
The character of Maya Gallo is portrayed by Laura San Giacomo. In the pilot, Maya is largely characterised as a hot-tempered, sassy journalist who takes on a job at the fictional glamour fashion magazine &quot;Blush&quot;, owned by her father Jack Gallo, after she was fired for tampering with an anchorwoman&#x27;s teleprompter and making her cry on the air. She is shown to have headstrong smarts despite her naïveté about life. Though she is seen as attractive and uses this if a situation calls for it, Maya frowns upon men looking at women solely as objects of sexual desire, and in keeping with her feminist views, instead encourages people to admire women for their intelligence or other attributes. However, this view puts her at odds with most of the magazine&#x27;s staff, thus providing much of the comedic conflict of the series.

She is commonly mistaken for being Puerto Rican. Her birthday is January 1, but her father Jack is unable to remember it. (Ep. &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;).

Maya is often seen dating other characters on the show. She and Elliot are shown as a couple for quite some time, and they are briefly engaged. However, Elliot&#x27;s fear of commitment causes him to instantly have a panic attack moments after he proposes to her. Among her other dates were Michael Tenzer (David Rasche), Chris (Dean Cain), Ray Liotta, and another man named Chris (Joe Rogan). Although she is involved in several relationships, she is never depicted getting legally married in the series. She is also very skilled at pitching; when she pitches a baseball to Dennis Finch, he thinks his hand is broken. However, if Maya starts pitching, she can&#x27;t stop.

===Jack Gallo===
The character of Jack Gallo, portrayed by George Segal, is the owner and publisher of &quot;Blush&quot;. During his daughter Maya&#x27;s childhood, Jack was an absent workaholic. The relationship between the two of them develops throughout the series, reaching its pinnacle when he hands the magazine over to Maya in the series finale after retiring. When extolling the virtues of an assistant to Maya, he notes that an assistant (in his case, Finch) can even become one&#x27;s &quot;best friend,&quot; although the sentiment was slightly dulled by his use of the pronoun &quot;it&quot; to refer to the hypothetical assistant (and therefore to Finch).

Jack is four times divorced, although he was married to Maya&#x27;s high school classmate Allie for the first half of the series. They have a daughter (Maya&#x27;s half-sister) named Hannah who was born in the first episode, &quot;Back Issues.&quot; Jack showers Hannah with affection, prompting Maya&#x27;s jealousy. This resentment disappears when Jack explains that he does not want to repeat with Hannah the mistakes he made with Maya. Jack has a running contest with Donald Trump as to who is, among other topics, the smartest, the richest, and the best gift giver.

In The Book of &quot;Jack,&quot; Finch refers to Jack as &#x27;Jackson Gilbert Gallo&#x27;; however, in &quot;La Cage&quot; Nina refers to Jack as &#x27;Jackson H. Gallo&#x27;.

===Nina Van Horn===
The character of Nina Van Horn (born Claire Noodleman in Colby, Kansas in 1953), portrayed by Wendie Malick, is the fashion editor at &quot;Blush&quot;. As a teenager, she had a daughter (Cloe) whom she gave up for adoption. When reuniting with her and finding out Cloe has a teenage daughter (Tess) she is initially shocked, but later proudly accepts that she is a grandmother. She was a cover girl and movie star in the 1970s and 1980s. She found that when she retired, people forgot her as quickly as they knew her. In a special &quot;Biography&quot; program about her, Pat Sajak says that no one can guess her name, and the contestants are sent home. Her partying once caused her to die in 1986 (to which she responded, &quot;it was only for 12 minutes, I&#x27;m obviously fine!&quot;). At one point, she mentions that she slept with Mick Jagger, broke up music bands such as The Eagles and The Jackson 5, and toured with Iggy Pop.

Nina is considered an alcoholic partially due to her casual nips of alcohol during the day at work. Due to her former status as a supermodel, she has been plagued by an obsession to party all night long and return to work the following morning with a hangover. She is also, if no longer an addict, extremely experienced in recreational pharmacy with a wide knowledge of (and access to) uppers, downers, mood regulators, and hallucinogenic compounds (she can identify not only that a Chinese sweet &quot;Lemon Wacky Hello&quot; is a hallucinogen, but also its chemical make up, by taste alone). She is understood to be promiscuous and possibly bisexual.

Nina is obsessed with her age and looks. In one episode, she mentioned that she had the telephone number of a plastic surgeon on speed dial, and when her age is nearly revealed over the P.A., she runs into Jack&#x27;s office to destroy the P.A. so nobody will know her age. Throughout the run of the show, she was vaguely in her late forties to early fifties, once blurting out that life&#x27;s no fun at fifty (Ep. &quot;Sid and Nina&quot;).

In most seasons, Nina often talks about her friend Binny. She is never seen but is heard about all the time. This usually leads to groans by other members of &quot;Blush&quot; who have to listen. In the episode &quot;The Mask,&quot; Finch and Elliot try to prove Binny isn&#x27;t real, only to find out she is real at the end. In the episode &quot;Bye Bye Binny,&quot; we hear that Binny dies and Nina must face the fact that she lost her only friend. Binny appears as a ghost to Nina in &quot;Strange Bedfellows,&quot; but her face is almost never shown. The exception is a black-and-white clip, when her face was partially bandaged after a facelift.

===Elliot DiMauro===
The character of Elliot DiMauro, portrayed by Enrico Colantoni, is the lead photographer for &quot;Blush&quot; who often dates the models. Elliot&#x27;s backstory was that he was &quot;discovered&quot; by Jack while selling his photography on the street. He also dated Maya for a period of time. In one episode, he mentions that he is not allowed to vote in an election, when he spills that he was once arrested and spent time in jail. In season four, episode 2, it is revealed that he had planned to propose to a former girlfriend but as he was buying flowers, he was subsequently the victim of a hit-and-run; the driver turned out to be Nina. Though Elliot is angry at Nina for ruining his relationship, upon meeting his ex later, Elliot discovers that his ex-girlfriend had three husbands who died in accidents involving boats. Elliot has a brother (in the episode &quot;Slow Donnie&quot;) named Donnie (played by David Cross).

===Dennis Finch===
The character of Dennis Quimby Finch, the executive assistant to Jack often referred to as simply &quot;Finch&quot;, was portrayed by David Spade. Born in Albany, New York (of Norwegian ancestry), Dennis attended Hudson River Junior College where he joined the cheerleading team. Dennis&#x27; father and brother are both firemen and they have suspected that Dennis may have been gay due to his effeminacy.

In general, Finch has been described as &quot;a self-centered horny pig who&#x27;d stop at nothing to get laid.&quot; He is discovered to be well endowed but does not realize this until Jack and Elliot bring it to his attention; they react with disgust when Finch says he always believed he was merely &quot;a little above average&quot; as he&#x27;d only seen other naked men in porn movies. Surreptitiously, Dennis writes articles for the &quot;Dear Miss Pretty&quot; advice column. Dennis used to compete in figure skating, as revealed in the season 3 episode, &#x27;Softball&#x27;. Dennis also likes to collect action figures and ceramic kittens. He lives in an apartment, number 803, in New York City (Manhattan), which was formerly Maya&#x27;s apartment before she moved in with Elliot.

He is also known to have a fear of owls from his mother&#x27;s side. He works as the executive assistant of &quot;Blush&quot; owner Jack Gallo, toward whom he has a slavish devotion (he once claimed he expected to be buried with Jack) and with whom he has a virtually telepathic rapport, enabling him to foresee Gallo&#x27;s every need and provide answers to even his vaguest questions (e.g. &quot;What&#x27;s that song that I like?&quot;). He also has a seemingly mystical ability to tell when something sexual is happening or even being mentioned; for example, he was able to figure out that Maya and Elliot were in a relationship simply by mentally comparing Elliot&#x27;s bite mark on an apple he was eating with a hickey on Maya&#x27;s neck, as well as seemingly appearing to cross a massive distance across countries to appear in a room just as Maya was propositioned by a photographer. In season 4, he marries a supermodel, Adrienne (Rebecca Romijn), although she asks for a divorce in the same season.

Highly intelligent, as a child he was able to hack into a German bank and steal $18,000 worth of Deutsche Mark as disclosed in season 3; he also reveals in the season 2 episode &quot;Jack&#x27;s Old Partner&quot; that he is so adept at twisting tax laws to favor him that the previous year, the IRS paid him $20,000 not to grow corn. In Season 6, episodes 2 and 3, it is discovered that his entire personality is stolen from a girl he saw at college on his first day at the freshmen mixer, Betsy Frayne (Amy Sedaris). This is revealed when she ends up working as a security guard for Blush.

===Kevin Liotta===
The character of Kevin Liotta, portrayed by Brian Posehn on a recurring basis, was the mail guy at &quot;Blush&quot; and in the show&#x27;s sixth season is discovered to be a cousin of film actor Ray Liotta. He is known for having an obsessive crush on Nina Van Horn, which often disturbed her. However, in one episode he develops a brief crush on Maya, about which she becomes disturbed after initially thinking when he was still interested in Nina that she should give him a chance. He is also found to be a very good operatic singer, which Jack discovers.

===Vicki Costa===
The character of Vicki Costa, portrayed by Rena Sofer, was hired by Jack and worked at &quot;Blush&quot; for part of the seventh and final season. Throughout her time on the show, she served as a creative consultant. She is not afraid to be honest with her coworkers and has proven to be tough when necessary. However, she was written out of the series midway through the last season with the character opting to resign from &quot;Blush&quot;.

===Wally Dick===
Wally, portrayed by Chris Hogan, is Maya&#x27;s roommate in season 1.

<doc id="654897" wikidata="Q324430" url="?curid=654897" title="Groundskeeper Willie">
<text>Dr. William MacDougal, better known as Groundskeeper Willie, is a recurring character on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the head groundskeeper and Janitor at Springfield Elementary School. Willie is almost feral in nature and is immensely proud of his Scottish origin. He is easily identifiable by his red hair and beard, as well as his aggressive temperament and thick, stereotypical Scottish accent.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
Willie is the groundskeeper and janitor at Springfield Elementary School and lives in a shack on the school premises. He is a Scotsman with an aggressive temper. Willie is an uncouth and unpleasant character, though essentially harmless. His personality is depicted as being incompetent, drunken, slow-witted, and quick to anger for little or no reason. Willie has shown antipathy to both his employer, Principal Skinner, and Bart Simpson, who frequently plays practical jokes on him. In the alternate continuity of &quot;Treehouse of Horror VI&quot;, his spirit plots revenge on the students of Springfield Elementary after getting burned to death by their parents&#x27; actions.

Due to the deliberately inaccurate continuity of the series, he has claimed to be from various parts of Scotland during the series, most recently Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands in the 2012 episode &#x27;The Daughter Also Rises&#x27;. This settled the previous continuity problem in which Willie had been stated to be a supporter of Aberdeen F.C, and to have lived in Glasgow. In early episodes, Willie&#x27;s father was said to be dead. However, his parents were later introduced in &quot;Monty Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, and lived near Loch Ness; which is near Inverness. In &quot;The Girl Who Slept Too Little&quot;, it is revealed that he has a cousin, &quot;Grave Digger Billy&quot;. In &quot;Dark Knight Court&quot; he describes himself as a &quot;Scottish Old Believer Presbyterian&quot; who &quot;hates Easter&quot; as some conservative Presbyterians reject Easter as a man-made feast on the basis of the regulative principle of worship.

Willie plays a supporting role in most of his episodes, but he was a main character in the episode &quot;My Fair Laddy&quot;, where Lisa Simpson introduced him to high culture as a science project.

In a running gag in each of the three segments of the episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror V&quot;, Willie tries to help the main protagonists, but is struck in the back with an axe by a different character each time, a reference to Dick Halloran&#x27;s death in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot;, of which the first segment, &quot;The Shinning&quot;, is a direct parody.

Willie has a troubled and distant relationship with his parents. In the episode &quot;My Fair Laddy&quot;, Willie recalls his birth and how his abusive father told him he would never amount to anything in life and would be lucky if he grew up to be &quot;garbage&quot;.

On two occasions, Willie frames Bart for pulling pranks that Bart would normally pull. In &quot;The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star&quot;, he unleashes a giant pie of rats on the Springfield Elementary medieval festival to get revenge for being cast as the village idiot and his cruel treatment. Skinner is quick to blame Bart and expels him. Willie is never shown being found out as the culprit, but it can be assumed that he is eventually found out after Bart is enrolled in Catholic school and earns his way back into Springfield Elementary. In &quot;Dark Knight Court&quot;, Willie causes hundreds of eggs to be splattered at the Springfield Easter celebration out of inbred hatred for the holiday. Bart is put on trial for the incident, only to be acquitted when Willie is caught and turned in by Lisa and Mr. Burns (as Fruit Batman).

==Character==

Groundskeeper Willie&#x27;s first appearance was in the season two episode &quot;Principal Charming&quot;, first broadcast on February 14, 1991. Originally, the character was written as simply being an angry janitor; his Scottish accent was added during a recording session. Dan Castellaneta, who voices several other characters including Homer Simpson, was assigned to do the voice. Castellaneta did not know what voice to use and Sam Simon, who was directing at the time, told Castellaneta to use an accent. He first tried a Spaniard&#x27;s voice, which Simon felt was too clichéd. He then tried a &quot;big dumb Swede&quot;, which was also rejected. For his third attempt, he used the voice of an angry Scotsman, which was considered to be more appropriate and was used in the episode. Originally thought by the directors to be a one-off appearance, Willie has since become a recurring character. Matt Groening later revealed that the character was based partially on Angus Crock, a kilt-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show &quot;Second City Television&quot;, who was portrayed by Dave Thomas and Jimmy Finlayson, the moustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films.

A recurring joke, which was first shown in &quot;Radio Bart&quot;, is that Groundskeeper Willie appears to have an average build with a beer belly, but upon removing his shirt he is incredibly muscular. One of Groundskeeper Willie&#x27;s trademarks is a gruffly-spoken insulting retort, which take the writers a long time to come up with, although they do not consider them that funny.

==Cultural impact==

Groundskeeper Willie&#x27;s description of the French as &quot;cheese-eating surrender monkeys&quot; from the episode &#x27;Round Springfield&quot; has become widely used, particularly in the run-up to the war in Iraq. The newspaper &quot;New York Post&quot; used the phrase &quot;Surrender Monkeys&quot; as the headline for its December 7, 2006 front page, referring to the Iraq Study Group and its recommendation that U.S. soldiers be withdrawn from Iraq by early-2008. The line was &quot;most likely&quot; written by Ken Keeler. The phrase &quot;Cheese Eating Surrender Monkeys&quot; has also been used by Jeremy Clarkson and Anthony Bourdain.

In 2009, Willie was added to the &quot;Famous Glaswegians&quot; webpage of Glasgow City Council, based on his line in &quot;Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious&quot;. A spokesman for Aberdeen F.C. disputed Glasgow&#x27;s claim to the character, citing the episodes &#x27;Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky&quot; and &quot;The Dad Who Knew Too Little&quot;. In Season 23 Episode 13 &quot;The Daughter Also Rises&quot;, first aired in 2012, it was finally stated that Groundskeeper Willie is from Kirkwall in Orkney, therefore ending this dispute.

In September 2014, Groundskeeper Willie featured in an official video in which he endorsed a vote for Scottish independence in an upcoming Scottish referendum, and put himself forward to lead a potentially independent Scotland while standing in front of the St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross with a tattoo on his chest that read: &#x27;Aye or Die!&#x27;. Following the result of the referendum where the Scottish electorate voted to remain as part of the UK, the producers released an image of Willie now standing in front of a Union Jack flag, looking depressed with his &quot;Aye or Die!&quot; tattoo replaced with a picture of the Queen and empty bottles of whisky with a newspaper featuring Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who was widely credited with giving the &quot;No&quot; campaign a last-minute boost.

===Reception===
In 2006, Groundskeeper Willie was named the fourth-best peripheral character in the history of the show by IGN, who said &quot;high-points for the character were being trained to be civilized, wrestling a wolf that was let loose in the school and becoming a substitute for the French language teacher – &#x27;Bon jourrr! You cheese-eating surrender monkeys!&#x27;&quot; IGN also named &quot;My Fair Laddy&quot;, the only episode which centres around Willie, the best episode of the seventeenth season. Jim Slotek of Sun Media called Willie the ninth-best &quot;Simpsons&quot; supporting character, and also made a Top Ten quotes list, which included Willie&#x27;s quote &quot;Och, back to the loch wi&#x27; ye, Nessie&quot;, from &quot;Selma&#x27;s Choice&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; reported in late-2005 that &quot;he is the most instantly recognisable Scot in the world: better known than Billy Connolly or Ewan McGregor, even Sean Connery.&quot; The same article quotes &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening as saying &quot;We wanted to create a school janitor that was filled with rage, sort of our tribute to angry janitors all over the world&quot;.

===Merchandising===
Three Groundskeeper Willie action figures were created by Playmates Toys for the World of Springfield series: Willie depicted in his usual appearance, released in 2001 in wave 4; &quot;Ripped Willie&quot;, released in 2002 as part of wave 8; and &quot;Kilted Willie&quot;, released in 2003 in wave 14.

In 2015, Groundskeeper Willie appeared as a non-playable character in the toys-to-life video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;. In game, he only appears in the Simpsons levels and all his voice lines are archive audio from Dan Castellaneta.

<doc id="654899" wikidata="Q5254807" url="?curid=654899" title="Deltaform Mountain">
<text>Deltaform Mountain is one of the mountains in the Valley of the Ten Peaks, located on the Continental Divide on the border of British Columbia and Alberta, and also on the border between Banff and Kootenay National Parks in Canada. The mountain was originally named Saknowa by Samuel Allen but Walter Wilcox named it to its official title in 1897 as it resembles the Greek letter delta.

Deltaform was first climbed in 1903 by August Eggers and Herschel Clifford Parker who were guided by Christian and Hans Kaufmann.

==Climbing routes==
The two main climbing routes are:
* North-West Ridge (Normal Route) II 5.5
* North Face, The Supercouloir IV 5.8

==Geology==
Deltaform Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Deltaform is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below with wind chill factors below .

<doc id="654902" wikidata="Q729129" url="?curid=654902" title="Michael Nader">
<text>Michael Nader (February 19, 1945 – August 23, 2021) was an American actor, known for his roles as Dex Dexter on the ABC primetime soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; from 1983 to 1989, and Dimitri Marick on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; from 1991 to 2001, and in 2013. He also starred as Kevin Thompson on the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1975 to 1978.

==Early life==
Nader was born on February 19, 1945, in St. Louis, Missouri. He was of German, Yugoslavian, and Lebanese descent. Nader was a nephew of actor George Nader. His parents split a few months after his birth. At the age of six, he was hit by a drunk driver, which left him with a visible facial scar. Nader accompanied his mother, Minette, when she moved to Los Angeles to pursue an entertainment career.

At 16, Nader was one of three young surfers featured in a September 1961 &quot;Life&quot; photo with George Jones spread accompanying the article &quot;The Mad, Happy Surfers: A Way of Life on the Wavetops&quot;. He graduated from Palisades Charter High School in 1963.

==Career==
Nader began his acting career in 1963 with small roles in several of American International Pictures &quot;Beach Party&quot; films, then billed as &quot;Mike Nader&quot;. He later appeared in the recurring role of Siddo in the 1965–66 TV series &quot;Gidget&quot;, and had a small role in the 1968 film &quot;Blue&quot;. Nader&#x27;s first soap opera role was playing Kevin Thompson on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1975 to 1978. In 1983, he appeared in the NBC prime time soap opera &quot;Bare Essence&quot; as Alexi Theopolis.

Nader won the role of Farnsworth &quot;Dex&quot; Dexter, the eventual third husband of Alexis Colby (Joan Collins), on the prime time soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; in 1983. He remained on the series until its cancellation in 1989.

Nader appeared as Nazi officer Burchhardt in the 1988 television film &quot;The Great Escape II: The Untold Story&quot;. The same year, he co-starred as Nick Scalfone in the TV movie &quot;Lady Mobster&quot;. In 1990, he appeared as Enzio Bonnatti in the miniseries &quot;Lucky Chances&quot;.

Nader returned to soap operas in 1991, portraying Dimitri Marick, the husband of Erica Kane (Nader&#x27;s &quot;Lady Mobster&quot; costar Susan Lucci), on the daytime drama &quot;All My Children&quot;. He played the role from 1991 to 1999 and from 2000 to 2001. Nader returned for &quot;All My Children&quot; online revival in 2013.

Nader also appeared in episodes of other television series, including &quot;The Flash&quot; (1991), &quot;Law And Order: SVU&quot; (2002), and &quot;Cold Case&quot; (2009).

==Personal life==

===Marriages and family===
Nader dated actress Ellen Barber for ten years, with the relationship ending around the same time as his role on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Nader married Robin Weiss in June 1984, and a month later they had a daughter. He was married to Jodi Lister at the time of his death, with the couple having been together for 18 years.

===Drug addiction and legal issues=== 
In 1984, Nader admitted to previously having drug and drinking problems, which prompted him to become sober in 1980. He was charged with drunk driving in 1997, and in 2001 was arrested for attempting to sell cocaine to an undercover police officer. Nader was let go from his role on &quot;All My Children&quot; soon after, with a statement from ABC that if he resolved his issues they would rehire him. It was more than a decade before they did, Nader meanwhile having sued the network, alleging that they never intended to bring him back to the show at all.

===Death===
Nader died on August 23, 2021, at the age of 76 at his home, ten days after being diagnosed with an untreatable form of cancer.

Nader had long been rumored to have been HIV positive. Speculation about his health first abounded in 2001 following his arrest and subsequent firing from &quot;All My Children&quot;. Nader vehemently denied having HIV. However, following his death, his daughter Lindsay revealed in an Instagram post that her father had, in fact, lived with HIV for several decades; he had contracted the virus before she was born, and was one of the longest known survivors.

<doc id="654903" wikidata="Q256589" url="?curid=654903" title="Emma Samms">
<text>Emma Elizabeth Wylie Samuelson MBE known professionally as Emma Samms, (born 28 August 1960) is an English actress and TV host, known popularly for her role as Holly Sutton on the American daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and as the second actress to play Fallon Carrington Colby on the prime time soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot;. She also portrayed the recurring role of Amanda Vardalis on the British soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;.

==Early life==
Samms was raised in the Jewish religion.

==Career==
Samms first played Holly Sutton Scorpio on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 1982 to 1985. With Samms choosing to leave the series amicably to go to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty&quot;, her character Holly seemingly perished in a plane crash. On 10 April 1985 Samms appeared in the fifth-season episode &quot;Kidnapped&quot; as Fallon Carrington Colby, a role originated by Pamela Sue Martin in 1981. The character was immediately transplanted into the new &quot;Dynasty&quot; spin-off &quot;The Colbys&quot; for two seasons (1985–1987). After the spinoff was cancelled, Samms and the character of Fallon returned to &quot;Dynasty&quot; in the 23 September 1987 eighth-season premiere &quot;The Siege - Part 1&quot;. Samms remained with &quot;Dynasty&quot; for two seasons until its last episode on 11 May 1989. She later returned for the 1991 miniseries &quot;&quot;.

After the show&#x27;s run, Samms appeared in several film and television roles. In 1989, Samms made a guest appearance on the sitcom &quot;My Two Dads&quot; playing Marcy Bradford, the deceased mother of Nicole Bradford (Staci Keanan) and the woman whom the two fathers (Paul Reiser; Greg Evigan) fought over. 

&quot;Fan favorite&quot; Samms had been so popular at &quot;General Hospital&quot; that Holly was brought back from the dead in January 1992 after a seven-year absence. She stayed in the role until 1993, during this time also playing Holly&#x27;s lookalike half-sister Paloma Perez, a heroic revolutionary.

In 1995, Samms appeared as the villainous Grayson Louder in the prime time soap opera &quot;Models Inc.&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, both produced by former &quot;Dynasty&quot; producer Aaron Spelling. She also appeared in the TV movie &quot;Treacherous Beauties&quot;.

Samms appeared in four episodes of the BBC series &quot;Holby City&quot; in 2003 and had a recurring run on the BBC daytime series &quot;Doctors&quot; as Amanda Vardalis in 2005. She made a seven-episode return to &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Holly in February 2006. After serving as a presenter (alongside &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star Tristan Rogers) for the Daytime Emmy Awards on 28 April 2006, she reappeared on &quot;General Hospital&quot; for a three-week run starting 1 May 2006, and then again on 30 June 2006. She subsequently stepped into the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children in Need&quot; reality series &quot;Celebrity Scissorhands&quot; as a hairdresser from 3–17 November 2006. On 20 September 2007 Samms guested on the long-running ITV series &quot;The Bill&quot; as drug addict Ella Winstanley.

In August 2009, Samms performed at the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in &quot;Shall We Dance&quot;, a dance revue of musicals by Richard Rodgers, choreographed by Adam Cooper who stars, alongside his wife Sarah Wildor.

In June 2014, Samms was announced as a contestant in BBC gymnastics show &quot;Tumble&quot;, and was the second celebrity to be eliminated.

In 2018, Samms performed alongside 26 other celebrities on a new Christmas song, called &quot;Rock With Rudolph&quot;, which was written and produced by Grahame and Jack Corbyn. The song was released digitally through independent record label Saga Entertainment, on 30 November 2018 in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital under the artist name The Celebs. The music video debuted exclusively with &quot;The Sun&quot; on 29 November 2018 and had its first TV showing on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; on 30 November 2018. The song peaked at number two on the iTunes pop chart. Later in 2018, Samms reprised her role as Amanda Vardalis on &quot;Doctors&quot;.

Samms continues to make appearances on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She returned in May 2009, March 2012, August 2013, July 2015, and September 2020.

On 22 August 2022, it was announced that Emma Samms would be returning to &quot;General Hospital&quot;, reprising the role of Holly Sutton, which she has been playing since 1982. Her episodes were scheduled to start airing in October 2022. According to &quot;Deadline&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s now set to return to the ABC sudser in October. Fans last saw Holly on September 18, 2020; though presumed dead, Holly was found alive and locked in a cell in Monte Carlo.&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s been 40 years since I first appeared on General Hospital and that, once again, I get to play the wonderful character of Holly Sutton,&quot; Samms told &quot;Deadline&quot;. &quot;No one is more interested in what&#x27;s happened to her since we saw her two years ago, being held captive by a mysterious villain, than me!&quot; Samms will resume the role once again when Holly returns in September 2024.

==Personal life==

Samms twice declined offers to appear in &quot;Playboy&quot;, once during her run on &quot;General Hospital&quot; and the second during &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Instead, she appeared on the cover of the February 1988 issue of &quot;Inside Sports&quot; in a bikini, as well as additional swimsuit shots inside the magazine.

In 1983, Samms and her cousin, film producer Peter Samuelson, co-founded the Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation, an organization that helps seriously ill children and their families cope with their pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, education and family activities. The organization was their response to losing Samms&#x27;s brother and Samuelson&#x27;s cousin, Jamie, who died at age nine from aplastic anemia.

In 1984 Samms and Tristan Rogers went public with their romance, but the relationship ended around the time she left &quot;General Hospital&quot; the next year. Engaged to Marvin Hamlisch in the early 1980s, Samms has been married four times: to Bansi Nagji (1991–92), and to Tim Dillon (1994–95). She married John Holloway (1996-2003), and the couple had two children. In 2021, Samms married journalist and TV presenter Simon McCoy.

Samms was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to seriously and terminally ill children.

In April 2018, Samms said that she had been dealing with Bell&#x27;s palsy, an illness that causes temporary facial paralysis. A month later, she sent an update on Twitter, writing &quot;paralysis on my face is 90% better&quot;.

She tested positive for COVID-19 during the global pandemic in March 2020 and has developed long-term complications from her initial infection.

<text>Linda Evans (born Linda Evenstad; November 18, 1942) is a retired American actress known primarily for her roles on television. In the 1960s, she played Audra Barkley, the daughter of Victoria Barkley (played by Barbara Stanwyck) in the Western television series &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (1965–1969). She is best known for portraying Krystle Carrington in the 1980s ABC primetime soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot;, a role she played from 1981 to 1989.

==Early life==
Evans, the second of three daughters, was born Linda Evenstad in Hartford, Connecticut, on November 18, 1942, to Arlene (née Dart) and Alba Evenstad, both of whom were professional dancers. &quot;Evenstad&quot; was the name of the small farm in Nes, Hedmark, in Norway from where her paternal great-grandmother emigrated to the United States in 1884 with her young son (Evans&#x27; grandfather) and other relatives. She has two sisters. When Evans was six months old, the family moved from Hartford to North Hollywood. She attended Hollywood High School, where she was a sorority sister of future actress Carole Wells. Her introduction to drama came through classes that she took &quot;as a form of therapy, to cure her of her shyness.&quot; When she started her professional career, she changed her last name to &quot;Evans&quot;.

==Career==
Evans&#x27; first guest-starring role was on a 1960 episode of &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;. The series starred John Forsythe, with whom she would costar 20 years later on &quot;Dynasty&quot;. After several guest roles in &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; between 1960 and 1962, and guest appearances on television series such as &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, Evans gained her first regular role in 1965 in &quot;The Big Valley&quot;. Playing Audra Barkley, daughter of Victoria Barkley (played by Barbara Stanwyck), Evans was credited in the series until it ended in 1969, though she was only a semiregular cast member during the last two seasons.

On December 31, 1967, John Derek recruited his future wife to operate one of his cameras after he had been commissioned by daredevil Evel Knievel to film his motorcycle jump of the fountains at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Evans photographed Knievel&#x27;s devastating crash after the jump failed.

Throughout the 1970s, Evans continued to appear on television largely in guest roles. She appeared in a slew of detective shows such as &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; with James Garner, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Harry O&quot; with David Janssen, &quot;Banacek&quot; with George Peppard, &quot;McCloud&quot; with Dennis Weaver, and &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; with Rock Hudson. In 1977, she starred with James Franciscus and Ralph Bellamy in the espionage drama series &quot;Hunter&quot;, though the show lasted for only 13 episodes.

In films, Evans co-starred with Lee Marvin and Robert Shaw in a 1979 thriller, &quot;Avalanche Express&quot;, and in 1980, she co-starred in one of Steve McQueen&#x27;s final films, the Western &quot;Tom Horn&quot;.

Evans was next cast as Krystle Carrington in Aaron Spelling&#x27;s opulent new primetime soap opera, &quot;Dynasty&quot;, which premiered in January 1981. Intended as ABC&#x27;s answer to the hit CBS series &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot; featured Evans as the former secretary and new wife of millionaire oil tycoon Blake Carrington, portrayed by her former costar John Forsythe. Although initially sluggish in the ratings, audience figures improved after the show was revamped and British actress Joan Collins was brought in to play opposite Evans and Forsythe as Blake&#x27;s scheming ex-wife, Alexis Carrington. By the 1984–85 season, &quot;Dynasty&quot; was the number one show on American television, outranking &quot;Dallas&quot;.

Evans won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Drama Series for her &quot;Dynasty&quot; role in 1981, and was subsequently nominated every year from 1982 to 1985. She was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1983. Evans won a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Female Performer in a New TV Program in 1982, and for Favorite Female TV Performer in 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986. She won a &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in 1984 and 1985.

Evans was hired as a spokesperson for the beverage Crystal Light due to her character&#x27;s name.

Evans left &quot;Dynasty&quot; in 1989, four months before the series came to an end, after only appearing in six episodes of the 22-episode ninth and final season. After leaving &quot;Dynasty&quot;, Evans semiretired from acting and made only occasional television appearances. Instead, she devoted her time to fitness issues and set up a small chain of fitness centers. In the 1990s, Evans hosted infomercials for Rejuvenique, a mask for toning facial muscles. She had previously written the &quot;Linda Evans Beauty and Exercise&quot; book in 1983. She also kept in touch with Forsythe, until he died on April 1, 2010, and she was devastated by his death. Evans first met Forsythe as an unfamiliar actress aged 18, for her first speaking part: Her agent &quot;signed me up for &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; and John Forsythe gave me my first speaking part.&quot;

In 1991, Evans returned to the role of Krystle Carrington for the television miniseries &quot;&quot;. Following this, she appeared in three made-for-TV movies in the 1990s, but then retired from screen acting altogether in 1997.

In 2005, actress Melora Hardin portrayed Evans in &quot;&quot;, a fictionalized television movie based on the creation and production of &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

In 2006, Evans reunited with her &quot;Dynasty&quot; castmates for the nonfiction reunion special &quot;Dynasty: Catfights and Caviar&quot;. She then starred in the stage play &quot;Legends&quot; opposite her former &quot;Dynasty&quot; rival Collins. In 2009, Evans appeared in and won the British TV program &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, working under Michelin-starred chef Marco Pierre White.

In 2021 Evans returned to acting, taking a small role in the critically acclaimed movie &quot;Swan Song&quot;.

Evans has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6834 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California.

==Personal life==
In her late teens, Evans was engaged to Patrick Curtis, who later became a press agent and married Raquel Welch. Subsequently, Evans has been married and divorced twice. Her first marriage was to actor, photographer, and film director John Derek. They started dating in 1965, married in 1968, and separated on Christmas Day 1973, when Derek disclosed his affair with 17-year old Mary Cathleen Collins (30 years his junior), who become known as Bo Derek after they married. Evans&#x27; second marriage was to Stan Herman, a property executive, from 1975 to 1979. She then lived with restaurant owner George Santo Pietro, from 1980 to 1984. Evans also dated &quot;The Big Valley&quot; castmate Lee Majors for a brief period following her second divorce, as well as businessmen Richard Cohen (an ex-husband of Tina Sinatra) and Dennis Stein (a former fiancé of Elizabeth Taylor) during the mid-1980s. In 1989, Evans began a relationship with new-age musician Yanni, which lasted until 1998.

Her best friends are her ex-stepdaughter, television writer Sean Catherine Derek, and Bunky Young, Evans&#x27; former assistant and friend of over 40 years, who died in 2021. She is also close with John Derek&#x27;s second wife, actress Ursula Andress, a sometime houseguest at her home in Beverly Hills. She is also friendly with Bo Derek, her former romantic rival.

After being diagnosed with idiopathic edema, Evans began investigating alternative healing, delving into Eastern philosophy and naturopathy. In 1985, she became involved with controversial metaphysical teacher J. Z. Knight and her Ramtha&#x27;s School of Enlightenment and eventually moved to Rainier, Washington to be closer to Knight and her school. Evans resides on a estate that she shares with her sister, nephew and ex-stepdaughter.

Evans appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine at the behest of her then-husband John Derek in 1971. As she gained fame on &quot;Dynasty&quot;, the photos were published a second time in 1982.

Evans was arrested in May 2014 for driving under the influence of a prescription drug.

== Early life ==
Savage was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Joanne and Lewis Savage (1946–2015), who worked as an industrial real estate broker and a consultant. His elder brother is actor and director Fred Savage, and his elder sister is actress and musician Kala Savage. His grandparents were Jewish and from Poland, Ukraine, Germany, and Latvia, and Savage was raised in Reform Judaism.

==Career==
=== Acting ===
Savage made his film debut at the age of 9 in his elder brother Fred Savage&#x27;s &quot;Little Monsters&quot; (1989) and appeared in the feature films &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry... They Get Even&quot; (1992), as Sam, the brainy little brother, and as a 10-year-old in &quot;Clifford&quot; (1994), the latter starring Martin Short. Savage&#x27;s stage debut was in &quot;The Laughter Epidemic&quot; at the Pasadena Playhouse. He also guest starred on his brother Fred&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; in the season three episode &quot;The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot; as a Cupid-esque character named Curtis Hartsell.

His first significant speaking role on network television was playing the recurring role of Matthew, son of the Judd Hirsch character, on the comedy series &quot;Dear John&quot; (1988). He was one of a family of orphans who con Robert Mitchum into being their guardian in &quot;A Family for Joe&quot; (NBC, 1990).

Savage received critical recognition for his portrayal of Coty Wyckoff, an angel-faced boy with the soul of a killer, in the ABC Event Series, &quot;Wild Palms&quot; (1993).

In May 1998, Savage again received critical acclaim, this time for playing Roddy Stern in Tony Award-winner Israel Horovitz&#x27;s rarely seen play &quot;Unexpected Tenderness&quot; at the Marilyn Monroe Theater. He received an Ovation Award for his performance.

In 2002, Savage starred in the film &quot;Swimming Upstream&quot; playing the best friend who was slightly immature but very supportive of his terminally ill friend.

Savage took a break from acting in both film and television for three years, but he later made a guest appearance in &quot;Still Standing&quot; as Seth Cosella, the boss of Bill Miller, played by Mark Addy. That same year he starred as Ford Davis in the independent feature &quot;Car Babes&quot;, which was shot on location in Los Gatos, California, and also guest starred as himself in an episode of the Disney Channel original series &quot;Phil of the Future&quot;.

In November 2012, Savage announced via his Twitter account that he had signed on to the &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; spin-off series, &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;. The series premiered on the Disney Channel on June 27, 2014, and features Savage&#x27;s character Cory and his &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; love interest Topanga (Danielle Fishel) married in their adult years with two children. The series follows Cory and Topanga&#x27;s daughter Riley (Rowan Blanchard) as she enters middle school and tries to navigate through life. Besides being Riley&#x27;s father, Cory is also her history teacher in this series; in addition to his on-screen role, Savage directed 10 episodes. The series was canceled after three seasons on January 5, 2017, with the final episode airing on January 20.

Savage has, on three occasions, portrayed younger versions of characters played by Mandy Patinkin in flashback scenes: in 2015 and 2020 in &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, and in 2020 in &quot;Homeland&quot;.

In 2020, Savage starred in the television film &quot;Love, Lights, Hanukkah!&quot; for Hallmark. In 2022, he was cast in the Lifetime film &quot;Girl in the Shed: The Kidnapping of Abby Hernandez&quot; as part of its &quot;Ripped from the Headlines&quot; feature film series where he portrays Nathaniel Kibby.

Savage interned for U.S. Senator Arlen Specter (R–PA) in 2003 as a requirement for completing his studies at Stanford University, where he graduated in 2004 with a degree in political science and as a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

In August 2022, Savage qualified as a candidate for the West Hollywood City Council. He was not elected for one of the three at-large positions. In March 2023, Savage announced his campaign as a Democrat for California&#x27;s 30th congressional district, held by Adam Schiff, who retired to run for United States Senate. He was defeated in the primary by state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman.

In October 2023, Savage signed an open letter written by Creative Community for Peace after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel. The article urged Hollywood to support Israel and support the country as it &quot;defends itself against a terrorist regime in Gaza that seeks Israel’s destruction.&quot;

<text>Dimitri Marick is a fictional character from the American ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. The role has been most notably portrayed by Michael Nader, previously famed for his role on &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Former head writers Agnes Nixon and Lorraine Broderick created the character in 1991, designing him as a brooding and mysterious character based on heroes from gothic literature, such as Maxim de Winter from Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novel &quot;Rebecca&quot; and Heathcliff from Emily Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD 11/26/91 &quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SOW 11/14/91 &quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The character&#x27;s introduction raised &quot;All My Children&quot; in the Nielsen ratings, placing it consistently as the second most-watched daytime soap opera in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Weekly 11/14/91&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SOU 11/19/91 &quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his debut on the soap opera, Dimitri became a complex leading man and took part in some of the most notable plots of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD 10/30/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He had a very popular romance with Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). Dimitri and Erica&#x27;s storylines include a tumultuous romance leading to two failed marriages and a miscarriage. One of the biggest obstacles in their relationship was Erica&#x27;s vindinctive and manipulative daughter, Kendall Hart (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Dimitri also had a popular romance with Alexandra Devane (Finola Hughes)&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Update 12/21/99&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a loving yet antagonistic relationship with his half-brother, Edmund Grey (John Callahan).&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 12/07/93&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1999, Nader was let go from &quot;All My Children&quot; due to budgetary considerations, however, he later returned in May 2000. The following year, the actor&#x27;s arrest brought him and the character to the center of a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists, as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, among other media outlets. As a result, Nader was let go again by the soap opera, with an official statement saying they would be prepared to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues. The role was temporarily recast with actor Anthony Addabbo, who was negatively received by viewers, and let go shortly after his debut. Nader later stated in an interview that ABC had informed him that they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back due to a lack of storyline. In 2004, Nader&#x27;s suit was subsequently thrown out. In May 2013, after a twelve-year absence from &quot;All My Children&quot;, Nader was announced to be reprising the role, with his return airing on June 12, 2013.

==Casting==
Casting the role of Dimitri gave &quot;All My Children&quot; difficulty. The series&#x27; casting director, Judy Blye Wilson, tested between fifteen and twenty actors, and could not find the right actor for the job. Wilson then learned that the former &quot;Dynasty&quot; star, Michael Nader was available and suggested the show offer him the part.

Before &quot;All My Children&quot; offered him the role of Dimitri Marick, Nader already planned on working in both Los Angeles and New York. &quot;My fiancee, Beth Windsor, had literally just worked into being bicoastal,&quot; he said. &quot;She had an apartment here and I had been seeking out some theater here in New York and would have been spending time both here and in L.A. So after we made the decision to go ahead with that game plan, this offer (Dimitri) came on the table and when we worked out all the figures moneywise it was a great opportunity.&quot; Despite Nader&#x27;s prime time success as &quot;Dynasty&#x27;s&quot; Dex Dexter, he did not look down on daytime television. &quot;The fact of the matter is we&#x27;re in a different era,&quot; he said. &quot;And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time.&quot; Another factor that contributed to his decision to join &quot;All My Children&quot; was the actors strike. He intended to stay on &quot;All My Children&quot; for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD 8/17/93&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since finding the right actor to play Dimitri took such a long time, the show had already begun taping around the character for two weeks. Nader spent his first weeks on &quot;All My Children&quot; working overtime to catch up. &quot;By the time we had resolved some of the terms,&quot; he said, &quot;they were really against the wall in terms of back story... In retrospect, I should have just slept on the set because it was like sixty or seventy pages a day!&quot; Nader also taped his scenes out of sequence while dealing with sixteen different scripts from different points in the story. To keep each scene straight he gave them each a name that described the scene&#x27;s main action. After those scenes were taped, they were spliced into the otherwise completed episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOU 08/29/00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This went on for two weeks until the episodes were all caught up. Another complication Nader dealt with was the wardrobe. He said, &quot;They had devised this sort of &#x27;tapestry&#x27; layered look for Dimitri and it was like doing scenes inside a sauna.&quot; This was eventually rectified, but not before the actor lost around twelve pounds in the two weeks.

Michael Nader was fired from &quot;All My Children&quot; in July 1999, due to budget considerations, and Dimitri was killed off.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD 10/22/99&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD 09/21/99&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a fan outcry from viewers who campaigned for the actor&#x27;s return. To partially appease them, the show&#x27;s executive producer, Jean Dadario Burke, offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOW 10/16/99&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected this offer because &quot;after being a major character for so long, it didn&#x27;t make any sense to me. So I declined. But if the network was interested in seriously discussing Dimitri&#x27;s return on a contract basis I would love to go back.&quot;

In May 2000, he was rehired and brought back into the role with a multi-year contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD 03/14/00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The return story scripted for the Dimitri character centered on the romance between his brother Edmund and his wife Alex. Dimitri was revealed to be alive just as his wife, Alex, and brother, Edmund, had sex for the first time. Nader said he wanted to create a deeper layer in the character instead of focusing solely on the love triangle between Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund. &quot;I do hope to pursue some sort of subtle spiritual change, some perception that Dimitri is different,&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD 05/09/00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He questioned the writers&#x27; storyline choice in not exploring the popular Dimitri and Erica romance again. &quot;I found it sort of odd that they&#x27;d move me so far away from Susan[Lucci, Erica],&quot; Nader said. &quot;They&#x27;re trying to explore these other themes.&quot;

Nader lost the role again in February 2001 as a result of the actor getting arrested for allegedly selling cocaine to an undercover police officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOW 07/03/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;All My Children&quot; released an official statement saying, &quot;If Mr. Nader gets the help that he needs and addresses his problem, and it makes sense for the show, we would be prepared to speak with Michael in the future.&quot; The network put Nader on probation and ordered him to seek help for his problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 03/25/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Addabbo temporarily took over the role, first airing on April 6, 2001. To prepare for the role, he watched tapes of Nader&#x27;s portrayal of Dimitri in order to see the relationships between Dimitri and other characters. Despite the fan protest against the role being recast, Addabbo told &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; he was not worried. &quot;I don&#x27;t find it intimidating,&quot; he said. &quot;I know how they can come to love a certain actor portraying a role and how he plays the role and everything, but this happens in daytime so frequently that I didn&#x27;t find it intimidating at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD 04/03/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; considered him an odd choice for a Dimitri recast since Addabbo usually portrayed &quot;all-American good guys&quot; such as &quot;Generations&quot; Jason Craig and &quot;Guiding Light&quot;&#x27;s Jim LeMay.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD 08/12/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of &quot;All My Children&quot; fans rejected Addabbo in the role and continued to campaign for Nader&#x27;s return. The controversy forced the writers to lessen Dimitri&#x27;s role on the show until July 2001 when Addabbo was let go &quot;for storyline reasons&quot;, according to ABC&#x27;s official statement.

During an interview, Nader told &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; that in late September 2001, ABC called a meeting with him to inform him that, though he resolved his personal problems, they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back due to lack of story. Nader argued that other storyline possibilities existed since he and Dimitri received &quot;a tremendous response&quot; from viewers. &quot;For years, Dimitri and Erica were a popular coupling,&quot; he said. &quot;A good friend of mine, Jack Scalia (Chris), is on...that alone would be a dynamic triangle.&quot;

In May 2013, following a twelve-year absence from &quot;All My Children&quot;, Nader was announced to be reprising the role of Dimitri, scheduled to begin in June. Initially his first airdate was 3 June, however, due to Prospect Park&#x27;s decision to reduce the number of episodes made available each week, he did not air until 12 June.

==Development==
Former head writers Agnes Nixon and Lorraine Broderick created the character Dimitri Marick in 1991. His original purpose was to rescue Natalie Marlowe from the well her sister, Janet Green, trapped her in. He was also designed as a rival for Natalie&#x27;s current love interest, Trevor Dillon. Trevor and Natalie were a popular couple at that point and the writers wanted to create a viable obstacle for them. eally exciting, romantic, handsome leading man, so that there would be a real impediment; you know we&#x27;d have a really exciting love story between Trevor and somebody as different from Trevor as we could get...because Trevor is a wonderful, warm, teddy bear, lovable, down-to-earth, right-out-there guy- and Dimitri is very much opposite from that.&quot; Broderick characterized the character in an interview with &quot;Soap Opera Update&quot;, stating:

Nixon and Broderick also crafted the character as a darkly brooding and mysterious man in the same vein as gothic literary heroes such as Heathcliff from &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, Edward Rochester from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, and Maxim de Winter from &quot;Rebecca&quot;. Nixon used these characters as inspiration for Dimitri because, as she told &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot;, &quot;In doing the &#x27;stolen life&#x27; story, I felt that we needed something to follow that was also a little larger than life, very romantic, and gothic.&quot; The characters played a part in shaping Dimitri as well as his environment and storylines. Maxim de Winter&#x27;s estate, Manderley, provided the inspiration for Dimitri&#x27;s Pine Valley estate, Wildwind. The design was taken from both the description in Du Maurier&#x27;s book and the depiction from the film &quot;Rebecca&quot;, a 1940 adaptation of the novel by Alfred Hitchcock. Like Mr. Rochester, the wife Dimitri falsely claims died years ago is revealed to be alive just before his marriage to another woman.

Nixon infused elements of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. &quot;There&#x27;s a gothic quality to it&quot;, she said, referring to the couple. &quot;It&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; or &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven&#x27;t divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It&#x27;s a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor&#x27;s talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry.&quot; Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly stayed away from the press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character in such a way as to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the &quot;Dynasty&quot; character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOW 11/26/91&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;John James (Jeff Colby) played the &#x27;aw, shucks;&#x27; nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull&quot;, he said. &quot;Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don&#x27;t know exactly how dark to make him yet.&quot; Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. &quot;The more we see of him, the more he inspires us&quot;, Broderick said. &quot;It&#x27;s just a wonderful marriage of actor and character[...] He&#x27;s giving us so many levels and such depth, that it&#x27;s a challenge. But it&#x27;s exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write.&quot;

==Storylines==

===Backstory===
To further the mystery element and add an international twist to the story, Nixon scripted Dimitri as having close European roots, though he is an American. He is the son of Hungarian parents, Hugo and Anna. Originally, his wealth comes from all the land around Pine Valley and the &quot;One Life to Live&quot; city Llanview, which he inherits from his parents. That is also where his fictional estate, Wildwind, is located. Later, during Dimitri&#x27;s 1992 story with Erica Kane, he is revealed to also be Hungarian nobility as Count Andrassy. He inherited his title and his Hungarian castle, Vadzel, from his father&#x27;s side. Both of his parents were dead by the time Dimitri first appears on &quot;All My Children&quot;. He spends his childhood years growing up in Europe and on the Wildwind estate. He has a complicated relationship with Edmund Gresham, the son of two of his family&#x27;s employees, unknown to Dimitri to be his half-brother. His childhood sweetheart was Angelique Voynitzeva, the daughter of his nanny, Helga. Helga later becomes his housekeeper. Fifteen years prior to Dimitri&#x27;s appearance on-screen, he and Angelique married. Angelique becomes pregnant but suffers a miscarriage which devastates both of them. Angelique has a riding accident which leaves her in a coma. Dimitri tries to find a cure, but is unable to and sends her to a clinic in Austria. He becomes reclusive for the next decade because of the guilt he feels over her condition. Finding Natalie in 1991 brings him out into society again.

===1991–2001===
Dimitri Marick first appears in Pine Valley in 1991 when he rescues Natalie Marlowe from the well her sister, Janet Green, trapped her in on the Wildwind estate. She resembles his comatose wife, Angelique, which attracts him to her. While he nurses her back to health, Dimitri becomes obsessively in love with her. His housekeeper, Helga, who is also Angelique&#x27;s mother, is not pleased about this. He lies to Natalie that his wife died years ago. Once Natalie recovers and everyone learns what happened to her at Janet&#x27;s hand, Natalie&#x27;s fiancé, Trevor Dillon, tries to reconcile with her. Natalie rejects her fiancé, Trevor Dillon, because Janet fooled him into thinking she was Natalie and he slept with her. Dimitri and Natalie become engaged. Unbeknown to Dimitri, Angelique has awoken from her coma and Helga brings her to Dimitri and Natalie&#x27;s engagement party. Natalie leaves Dimitri and reunites with Trevor. Dimitri reconciles with his wife.

Dimitri begins an affair with Erica Kane. He falls in love with her, but feels he must stay with Angelique. Edmund Grey, the son of a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see Angelique, his close childhood friend. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri&#x27;s father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found Hugo Marick&#x27;s will that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will as revenge for Dimitri&#x27;s affair with Erica, but when Dimitri assures Helga he is now completely devoted to Angelique, she destroys the will in order to keep the estate for her daughter. Edmund files a lawsuit to have Hugo&#x27;s body exhumed, which causes the hatred between him and Dimitri to deepen even more. Eventually, the truth about what Helga did is revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past behind them and they bond as brothers. They develop an extremely close and loving relationship, but they also continue to have a standing rivalry.

Dimitri ends his marriage to Angelique and marries Erica. The newlyweds settle into Wildwind and Dimitri develops a close relationship with Erica&#x27;s daughter, Bianca Montgomery. Dimitri&#x27;s happiness with Erica is disrupted by Erica&#x27;s vengeful older daughter, Kendall Hart. Kendall tells Dimitri she is in love with him, but he immediately rejects her. As revenge, Kendall implies to Erica that Dimitri sexually assaulted her and Erica, who was raped by Kendall&#x27;s father Richard Fields, stabs Dimitri in the neck. Erica is charged with attempted murder, but is acquitted.

Another bombshell is dropped in Dimitri&#x27;s life when he finds out that Anton Lang, who he believed to be brother of his maid Corvina (Margaret Sophie Stein), is actually his son with Corvina. Dimitri had had a drunken one-night stand with Corvina which he had no memory of. Dimitri is happy to finally be a father and attempts to forge relationship with Anton without telling him about his parentage. When the truth finally comes out, Anton is devastated and wants nothing to do with Dimitri. Anton later marries Kendall to throw it in Dimitri&#x27;s face. Eventually, Anton sees Kendall for the manipulator that she is and divorces her. Anton and Dimitri make peace with each other before Anton leaves town.

During a time when they are both particularly vulnerable, Dimitri and Edmund&#x27;s wife, Maria, sleep together. When Maria finds out she is pregnant, the baby&#x27;s paternity is in question. They have a DNA test done and Skye Chandler, who is in love with Edmund, tampers with test so it will show Dimitri is the father when it is in fact Edmund. After Maria confesses everything, a devastated Edmund tells Dimitri that he is dead to him and he will be bringing the child up as his own. Erica also finds out she is pregnant around this time, but miscarries. Maria gives birth to a baby girl with Erica&#x27;s help. Maria&#x27;s daughter is presumed dead after a car accident, but she has actually been kidnapped by Erica and named Sonya. Erica eventually returns the baby to Maria and she is renamed Maddie. Maria is later presumed dead in a plane crash. Dimitri discovers that Edmund is Maddie&#x27;s father when he finds out their blood types do not match. He takes her to Vadzel, but Edmund tracks them down and takes back custody of Maddie. The brothers remain estranged for quite some time, but eventually manage to reconcile. Dimitri leaves Pine Valley permanently in 2001 with his current wife, Alex Devane.

===2013===
In June 2013, Dimitri received an email from his old friend and former lover Brooke English. Brooke was shocked when Dimitri responded by showing up at her door, and told him that she thought she&#x27;d never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and Alex had divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with his family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning to bore him and her timing couldn&#x27;t have been better. Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund&#x27;s children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who had died in a fire 8 years earlier.

Brooke explained to Dimitri that she needed someone to oversee the online division of Chandler Media, and she felt Dimitri would be perfect for the job. Dimitri eagerly accepted. Later, Brooke re-introduced Dimitri to J.R. Chandler, who, although appeared happy to see Dimitri, was nonetheless jealous of the fact that Dimitri, and not him, would be overseeing Chandler Media.

As Dimitri and Brooke worked more and more closely together, Dimitri developed feelings for her, which came to a head when he kissed her shortly after the Chandler Media Gala. Brooke told Dimitri that can never happen again, because she is engaged to marry Adam.

==Post Cancellation==

During a March 2019 episode of General Hospital the character Robert Scorpio tells Anna Devane that he has been in touch with Dimitri related to an investigation into ex-wife Alex&#x27;s activities, and that Dimitri has handed over records relating to Alex for Anna to review.

In February 2021, Dimitri (with only his hands being seen) mails a letter containing Alex&#x27;s last will and testament, as well as a USB thumb drive to Peter August (Wes Ramsey). This led to rumors that Dimitri might be making an appearance on General Hospital. However, Michael Nader&#x27;s death later that same year prevented this from occurring.

==Reception==
Dimitri became a popular leading man soon after his debut on &quot;All My Children&quot; in 1991 and &quot;was prominent in some of the show&#x27;s most memorable tales of that decade.&quot; The character and his portrayer, Michael Nader, were credited with lifting the Nielsen ratings as well as saving the Natalie, Trevor, and Janet storyline. In that storyline, the character Janet Green imprisons her sister Natalie in a well and masquerades as Natalie to seduce her fiancé Trevor. Fans and soap opera press criticized the story. In &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot;, Marlena De Lacroix said, &quot;Dimitri was the saving grace of the storyline I&#x27;d earlier called an artistic disaster: the Janet and Natalie body switch.&quot; She described Dimitri as a &quot;cross between Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s Sheik and the gothic Maxim de Winter from Rebecca.&quot; Viewers found the character &quot;irresistible&quot;; so much so that &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; questioned whether the character was a diversion from the failed storyline. &quot;All My Children&quot;&#x27;s head writer Agnes Nixon denied this. &quot;We expected to get negative mail on Janet/Nat,&quot; she said, &quot;they [the viewers] don&#x27;t like it but they [keep] watching.&quot;

The character gained further success with the popular Dimitri and Erica pairing. In 1993, viewers named them a supercouple, along with &quot;One Life to Live&#x27;s&quot; Bo and Nora and &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;&#x27; Roman and Marlena. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed them among the top seventeen supercouples. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; compared them to the real life couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton because of their tumultuous nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 03/01/94&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The romance between Dimitri and Finola Hughes&#x27; Alexandra Devane Marick also rose in popularity. &quot;Soap Opera Update&quot; named them the best couple of the year in 1999 for &quot;All My Children&quot; despite the fact that their love story played out through brief flashbacks. The magazine compared the couple&#x27;s relationship to the television series &quot;Once and Again&quot;. &quot;Soap Opera Update&quot; also referred to them as the &quot;break out supercouple of the year&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Update 10/10/00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dimitri character took a darker turn in 1997, in what &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; considered an effort to make Erica more sympathetic after her role in the kidnapping of the baby Maddie Grey (then known as Sonya).&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 08/12/97&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; praised the move in an article naming Nader Performer of the Week, saying, &quot;Nader has been surprisingly effective as a meanie, and nothing short of brilliant taking an already complex character and making him more compelling.&quot; &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&#x27;s&quot; Gabrielle Winkel expressed similar sentiments, saying, &quot;Michael Nader is far more entertaining and compelling now that Dimitri is out for himself than when he was as Erica&#x27;s devoted husband...&quot;AMC&quot; was right on target when it developed Dimitri&#x27;s dark side. Nader&#x27;s brooding looks and raspy voice have always given Dimitri that evil edge. Nader, though, wisely keeps Dimitri&#x27;s obsessiveness sufficiently in check to make it believable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Weekly 11/18/97&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the storyline &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; again named him Performer of the Week for &quot;unleashing the sort of go-for-broke fury and fray that actors are usually reluctant to release unless they&#x27;re certain their character is about to be killed off.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 02/10/98&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; noted the rarity of brothers like Edmund Grey and Dimitri Marick. In the soap opera genre, brothers with a standing rivalry as well as a strong fraternal bond are considered to be a rarity. Sisters on soap operas were usually the ones who shared &quot;men, makeup, and misery.&quot; Dimitri and Edmund&#x27;s relationship was scripted as complicated, transitioning between loving and antagonistic. Their relationship gained positive feedback from both viewers and the soap opera media. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; named them Best Brothers of 1994, saying, &quot;In Michael Nader (Dimitri) and John Callahan (Edmund), &quot;AMC&quot; has charismatic performers with chemistry, and they&#x27;re making the most of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 04/01/94&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Complications in the brothers&#x27; relationship included childhood jealousies, the revelation that they were brothers, Dimitri&#x27;s one-night stand with Edmund&#x27;s wife Maria and subsequent question of the paternity of Maddie Grey, and the Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund triangle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 12/09/97&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 10/03/00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the conflict, they displayed a loving relationship where they stood by each other. In describing the relationship, Nader said, &quot;The storyline with Edmund and Dimitri, the Marick brothers, there wasn&#x27;t a brother duo on television that had the sort of power that John and I could bring to that relationship.&quot;

Storylines they featured in met with both praise and negative reactions. With the plot centering on Maddie Grey&#x27;s paternity and kidnappings, &quot;All My Children&quot; &quot;fans revolted en masse.&quot; Yet &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; hailed the plot as &quot;one of the best told, most fascinating storylines of the year.&quot; In the Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund triangle, viewers took two opposing views on which brother should end up with Alex. &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot; proclaimed the triangle a hit,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Weekly 12/19/00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while &quot;Soap Opera Update&quot; rated it a ten out of ten. In the storyline, Alex and Edmund fall in love while her husband Dimitri is presumed dead. They eventually become engaged. When he returns and witnesses their happy relationship, Dimitri decides not to interfere. &quot;The dilemma for Dimitri is his brother&#x27;s happiness,&quot; Nader said. &quot;As much as he loves Alex, he&#x27;s made the choice to give her to Edmund.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 08/22/00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Alex discovers Dimitri alive first. They reunite and engage in sex. Edmund finds out and feels betrayed by them both. The scenes of the confrontation between all three characters was written to express the views of both the Dimitri and Alex and the Edmund and Alex fans. The viewers who rooted for Edmund argued that Dimitri and Alex betrayed him by having sex immediately after reuniting. Viewers who supported Dimitri argued that the reunion was not a betrayal since Dimitri was Alex&#x27;s husband. Alex ends up with Dimitri, which changes &quot;Edmund from a jaded, one-note character into a far more multidimensional and intriguing hero.&quot; &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot; praised &quot;All My Children&quot; for not dragging the triangle out and instead using it as a catalyst for character development.

Charlie Mason from &quot;Soaps She Knows&quot; put Addabbo&#x27;s portrayal of the character on his list of the worst soap opera temporary recasts, commenting that &quot;Addabbo lacked the air of Old World regality that Nader exuded, fans balked, and the recast was sent packing before he&#x27;d even had time to finish nibbling his Welcome to &quot;All My Children&quot; gift basket.&quot;

==Controversy==
In what &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; named the year&#x27;s Dumbest Male Axing in 1999, Nader was fired from the role of Dimitri and the character was killed off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 12/28/99&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The firing &quot;set off a firestorm of protest from devoted fans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 12/21/99&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Those fans came together to form a group called the Loyalists and campaigned for the actor&#x27;s return. They &quot;bombarded&quot; &quot;All My Children&quot; with letters centering on three major complaints concerning Nader&#x27;s dismissal, as summarized in &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;: &quot;1) They have waited two years for a Dimitri/Erica reunion, which they won&#x27;t get now that he&#x27;s leaving. 2) They adore Nader&#x27;s chemistry with on-screen brother John Callahan (Edmund) and don&#x27;t want to lose it. 3) They fear that Nader has been sacrificed to make room in the budget for new- and younger- cast members.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 06/29/99&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the last complaint, an &quot;All My Children&quot; spokesperson pointed out the storylines planned for characters over thirty years old such as Tad, Dixie, Erica, David, Edmund, and Alex.

Nader thanked the Loyalists for their support and expressed his surprise at the size of the response. &quot;[T]he expanse and impact were quite astounding to me,&quot; he said. &quot;In my years of doing this, I never experienced this kind of support.&quot; Susan Lucci commented on the fan response, saying, &quot;So many people stop me on the street and ask me, &#x27;Will Dimitri ever come back and will he and Erica ever get together.&#x27;&quot;

At a fan luncheon, the Loyalists confronted &quot;All My Children&#x27;s&quot; executive producer Jean Dadario Burke with a petition asking for Nader&#x27;s return. They also organized a tune-out of the show on November 5, 1999. To appease them at least in part, Burke offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis, which he refused. In 2000, &quot;All My Children&quot; rehired him on a contract basis. His co-star, Hughes was happy about the news, saying his return would &quot;give a huge injection of &#x27;fuel&#x27;&quot; to the Alex and Edmund romance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps In Depth 03/21/00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Nader was arrested for cocaine possession. &quot;All My Children&quot; suspended him and demanded he get treatment. They cast Addabbo in the role as a temporary replacement. Fans of Nader, the Loyalists in particular, rejected the recast. Though the majority of the viewers did not take to him, Addabbo gained an amount of support from fans who wanted him to continue in the role or portray a different character once Nader returned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 04/10/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; criticized the casting of Addabbo because the actor usually portrayed &quot;all-American good guys&quot;, the opposite of the Dimitri Marick role. In July of that year, Addabbo was let go and Dimitri was officially written out.

After Nader got help for his drug addiction at Hazelton Clinic in Minnesota,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 04/23/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;All My Children&quot; opted not to bring him back. Nader filed a $31.7 million lawsuit against ABC for breach of contract under the Americans with Disabilities Act. ABC&#x27;s lawyers cited Nader&#x27;s violation of the morals clause in his contract as justification for not rehiring him. The firing and lawsuit caught the attention of non-soap opera medias such as &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Justice&quot;, &quot;Extra&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. Manhattan Federal Judge Jed S. Rakoff threw out the suit in 2004.
